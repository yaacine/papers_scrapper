17000,"A detailed description is reported of the analysis used by the CMS Collaboration in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in pp collisions at the LHC, which led to the observation of a new boson. The data sample corresponds to integrated luminosities up to 5.1 fb− 1 at TeV, and up to 5.3 fb− 1 at TeV. The results for five Higgs boson decay modes γγ, ZZ, WW, ττ, and bb, which show a combined local significance of 5 standard deviations near 125 GeV, are reviewed. A fit to the invariant mass of the two high resolution channels, γγ and ZZ→ 4ℓ, gives a mass estimate of 125. 3±0. 4 (stat.)±0. 5 (syst.) GeV. The measurements are interpreted in the context of the standard model Lagrangian for the scalar Higgs field interacting with fermions and vector bosons.

17001,"This paper describes the CMS trigger system and its performance during Run 1 of the LHC. The trigger system consists of two levels designed to select events of potential physics interest from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of proton-proton (heavy ion) collisions. The first level of the trigger is implemented in hardware, and selects events containing detector signals consistent with an electron, photon, muon, tau lepton, jet, or missing transverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based algorithms is used to select events for subsequent processing. The trigger thresholds are adjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity during data taking in order to restrict the output rate to 100 kHz, the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout electronics. The second level, implemented in software, further refines the purity of the output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline event storage. The objectives, strategy and performance of the trigger system during the LHC Run 1 are described.",CMS collaboration,1417,6236594925451814496,arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02366,,,,The CMS trigger system,https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02366,,2016,/scholar?cites=6236594925451814496,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:D0NosnH9lYgC

17004,"Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a  or a  boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes , , and . All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton--proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb  at  TeV and 20 fb  at  TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.090.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the  decay of  and  standard deviations, respectively.

The papaya genome is three times the size of the Arabidopsis genome, but contains fewer genes, including significantly fewer disease-resistance gene analogues. Comparison of the five sequenced genomes suggests a minimal angiosperm gene set of 13,311. A lack of recent genome duplication, atypical of other angiosperm genomes sequenced so far 2, 3, 4, 5, may account for the smaller papaya gene number in most functional groups.

17017,"At the Large Hadron Collider, the identification of jets originating from b quarks is important for searches for new physics and for measurements of standard model processes. A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS to select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, and the presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performance of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used in this study were recorded in 2011 at root s = 7TeV for a total integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb(-1). The efficiency for tagging b-quark jets has been measured in events from multijet and t-quark pair production. CMS has achieved a b-jet tagging efficiency of 85% for a light-parton misidentification probability of 10% in multijet events.

There was a net loss of bone at doses below 15 μg per day and a net gain at doses of 25 μg per day and above. At doses between 15 and 25 μg daily, bone was neither gained nor lost.The loss of bone with the low doses was due to expansion of the medullary cavity that was unaccompanied by any change in total bone width. There was no change in bone volume with the intermediate doses because endosteal resorption of bone was offset by periosteal apposition.

17022,"Classification of high-grade neuroendocrine tumours (HGNT) of the lung currently recognises large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) as distinct groups. However, a similarity in histology for these two carcinomas and uncertain clinical course have led to suggestions that a single HGNT classification would be more appropriate. Gene expression profiling, which can reproduce histopathological classification, and often defines new subclasses with prognostic significance, can be used to resolve HGNT classification.We used cDNA microarrays with 40386 elements to analyse the gene expression profiles of 38 surgically resected samples of lung neuroendocrine tumours and 11 SCLC cell lines.

17040,The cross section for the production of single top quarks in the t channel is measured in proton–proton collisions at 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb− 1. The event selection requires one muon and two jets where one of the jets is identified as originating from a bottom quark. Several kinematic variables are then combined into a multivariate discriminator to distinguish signal from background events.

17074,"Correctly predicting the direction that branches will take is increasingly important in today's wide-issue computer architectures. The name program-based branch prediction is given to static branch prediction techniques that base their prediction on a program's structure. In this article, we investigate a new approach to program-based branch prediction that uses a body of existing  programs to predict the branch behavior in a new program. We call this approach to program-based branch prediction evidence-based static prediction, or ESP. The main idea of ESP is that the behavior of a corpus of programs can be used to infer the behavior of new programs. In this article, we use neural networks and decision trees to map static features associated with each branch to a prediction that the branch will be taken.

Next-to-leading-order quantum chromodynamic calculations with nonperturbative corrections are found to overpredict jet production cross sections in p p for small distance parameters. The jet nuclear modification factors for PbPb compared to p p collisions, show a steady decrease from peripheral to central events, along with a weak dependence on the jet p T.

17138,"This paper presents a continental‐scale phenological analysis of African savannas and woodlands. We apply an array of synergistic vegetation and hydrological data records from satellite remote sensing and model simulations to explore the influence of rainy season timing and duration on regional land surface phenology and ecosystem structure. We find that (i) the rainy season onset precedes and is an effective predictor of the growing season onset in African grasslands. (ii) African woodlands generally have early green‐up before rainy season onset and have a variable delayed senescence period after the rainy season, with this delay correlated nonlinearly with tree fraction. These woodland responses suggest their complex water use mechanisms (either from potential groundwater use by relatively deep roots or stem‐water reserve) to maintain dry season activity.

From a cognitive neuroscience perspective, the emotional attentional bias in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could be conceptualized either as emotional hyper-responsiveness or as reduced priming of task-relevant representations due to dysfunction in ‘top-down’regulatory systems. We investigated these possibilities both with respect to threatening and positive stimuli among traumatized individuals with and without PTSD.Method. Twenty-two patients with PTSD, 21 trauma controls and 20 non-traumatized healthy participants were evaluated on two tasks. For one of these tasks, the affective Stroop task (aST), the emotional stimuli act as distracters and interfere with task performance. For the other, the emotional lexical decision task (eLDT), emotional information facilitates task performance.Results. Compared to trauma controls and healthy participants, patients with PTSD showed increased interference for negative but not positive distracters on the aST and increased emotional facilitation for negative words on the eLDT.Conclusions.

Aims We aimed to discover the mechanisms causing decline in abundance of two species of small mammals, the pale field rat, Rattus tunneyi, and the western chestnut mouse, Pseudomys nanus, in response to fire.

Resonant and nonresonant modes of HH production have been probed and no significant excess relative to the background-only hypotheses has been found in either mode. Upper limits on cross sections of the two HH production modes have been set. The results have been combined with previously published searches at sqrt (s)= 8 TeV, in decay modes to two photons and two b quarks, as well as to four b quarks, which also show no evidence for a signal. Limits from the combination have been set on resonant HH production by an unknown particle X in the mass range m [X]= 300 GeV to m [X]= 1000 GeV.

17157,"Satellite derived vegetation indices (VIs) are broadly used in ecological research, ecosystem modeling, and land surface monitoring. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), perhaps the most utilized VI, has countless applications across ecology, forestry, agriculture, wildlife, biodiversity, and other disciplines. Calculating satellite derived NDVI is not always straight-forward, however, as satellite remote sensing datasets are inherently noisy due to cloud and atmospheric contamination, data processing failures, and instrument malfunction. Readily available NDVI products that account for these complexities are generally at coarse resolution; high resolution NDVI datasets are not conveniently accessible and developing them often presents numerous technical and methodological challenges. We address this deficiency by producing a Landsat derived, high resolution (30 m), long-term (30+ years) NDVI dataset for the conterminous United States. We use Google Earth Engine, a planetary-scale cloud-based geospatial analysis platform, for processing the Landsat data and distributing the final dataset. We use a climatology driven approach to fill missing data and validate the dataset with established remote sensing products at multiple scales. We provide access to the composites through a simple web application, allowing users to customize key parameters appropriate for their application, question, and region of interest.

17172,"Expectation Maximization (EM) and the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) are two iterative computed tomography reconstruction algorithms often used when the data contain a high amount of statistical noise, have been acquired from a limited angular range, or have a limited number of views. A popular mechanism to increase the rate of convergence of these types of algorithms has been to perform the correctional updates within subsets of the projection data. This has given rise to the method of Ordered Subsets EM (OS-EM) and the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART).

17180,"An optimal HIV vaccine should induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that neutralize diverse viral strains and subtypes. However, potent bnAbs develop in only a small fraction of HIV-infected individuals, all contain rare features such as extensive mutation, insertions, deletions, and/or long complementarity-determining regions, and some are polyreactive, casting doubt on whether bnAbs to HIV can be reliably induced by vaccination. We engineered two potent VRC01-class bnAbs that minimized rare features. According to a quantitative features frequency analysis, the set of features for one of these minimally mutated bnAbs compared favorably with all 68 HIV bnAbs analyzed and was similar to antibodies elicited by common vaccines. This same minimally mutated bnAb lacked polyreactivity in four different assays. We then divided the minimal mutations into spatial clusters and dissected the epitope components interacting with those clusters, by mutational and crystallographic analyses coupled with neutralization assays. Finally, by synthesizing available data, we developed a working-concept boosting strategy to select the mutation clusters in a logical order following a germline-targeting prime. We have thus developed potent HIV bnAbs that may be more tractable vaccine goals compared to existing bnAbs, and we have proposed a strategy to elicit them.

Overall, the achieved statistical accuracy on the module alignment is found to be significantly better than 10μm.",CMS collaboration,79,12452596719956619006,Journal of Instrumentation,06,P06009,IOP Publishing,Alignment of the CMS tracker with LHC and cosmic ray data,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/9/06/P06009/meta,9,2014,/scholar?cites=12452596719956619006,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:zDhyt2jClVkC
17214,"Pneumonia results from bacteria in the alveoli. The alveolar epithelium consists of type II cells, which secrete surfactant and associated proteins, and type I cells, which constitute 95% of the surface area and meet anatomic and structural needs. Other than constitutively expressed surfactant proteins, it is unknown whether alveolar epithelial cells have distinct roles in innate immunity. Because innate immunity gene induction depends on NF-κB RelA (also known as p65) during pneumonia, we generated a murine model of RelA mutated throughout the alveolar epithelium. In response to LPS, only 2 of 84 cytokine transcripts (CCL20 and CXCL5) were blunted in lungs of mutants, suggesting that a very limited subset of immune mediators is selectively elaborated by the alveolar epithelium. Lung CCL20 induction required epithelial RelA regardless of stimulus, whereas lung CXCL5 expression depended on RelA after …",Kazuko Yamamoto and Joseph D Ferrari and Yuxia Cao and Maria I Ramirez and Matthew R Jones and Lee J Quinton and Joseph P Mizgerd,79,9543558573447410934,The Journal of Immunology,5,2450-2459,American Association of Immunologists,Type I alveolar epithelial cells mount innate immune responses during pneumococcal pneumonia,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/189/5/2450.short,189,2012,/scholar?cites=9543558573447410934,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:6APfbPi00UoC

17227,"This paper reports analysis of a range of survey, interview and usage-log data on the level of use of broadband Internet by households in the UK and Europe. It discusses the (few) discernable differences between PSTN and broadband Internet users in mid 2001. The analysis suggests that, while there are few socio-economic and demographic differences, broadband users tend to use a wider range of applications, access them more frequently and for longer. However, because most broadband users have been, on average, users of the Internet for longer than PSTN users, these effects may be to do with their Internet competencies rather than the nature of broadband Internet itself. The paper also suggests that the interaction of speed, flat rate and ‘always-on' is a key feature of broadband and a key value model to the user.

Similar to X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), graphics processing units (GPUs) offer an affordable platform to meet these demands. In this paper, we outline a CT reconstruction approach for ET that is optimized for the special demands and application setting of ET. It exploits the fact that ET is typically cast as a parallel-beam configuration, which allows the design of an efficient data management scheme, using a holistic sinogram-based representation. Our method produces speedups of about an order of magnitude over a previously proposed GPU-based ET implementation, on similar hardware, and completes an iterative 3D reconstruction of practical problem size within minutes.

17236,A study of dijet production in proton–proton collisions was performed at\(\sqrt {s}= 7\mbox {~ TeV}\) for jets with p T> 35 GeV and| y|< 4.7 using data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2010. Events with at least one pair of jets are denoted as “inclusive”. Events with exactly one pair of jets are called “exclusive”. The ratio of the cross section of all pairwise combinations of jets to the exclusive dijet cross section as a function of the rapidity difference between jets| Δy| is measured for the first time up to| Δy|= 9.2. The ratio of the cross section for the pair consisting of the most forward and the most backward jet from the inclusive sample to the exclusive dijet cross section is also presented.

17237,"A search for flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) in events with the top quark and the Higgs boson is presented. The Higgs boson decay to a pair of b quarks is considered. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at TeV. Two channels are considered: single top quark FCNC production in association with the Higgs boson (pp→ tH), and top quark pair production with FCNC decay of the top quark (t→ qH). Final states with one isolated lepton and at least three reconstructed jets, among which at least two are associated with b quarks, are studied.

We found normal expression and localization of a fundamental regulator of mitosis, Aurora-B/AIM-1, during prophase in polyploidizing mouse bone marrow megakaryocytes.

Megakaryocytes treated with a proteasome inhibitor display Aurora-B/AIM-1 properly expressed and localized to the midzone, suggesting that protein degradation contributes to this atypical appearance. In contrast, survivin, an Aurora-B/AIM-1 coregulator of mitosis, is not detected at any stage of the endomitotic cell cycle, and in most megakaryocytes proteasome inhibition does not rescue this phenotype.

17252,"Electromagnetic (EM) medical technologies are rapidly expanding worldwide for both diagnostics and therapeutics. As these technologies are low-cost and minimally invasive, they have been the focus of significant research efforts in recent years. Such technologies are often based on the assumption that there is a contrast in the dielectric properties of different tissue types or that the properties of particular tissues fall within a defined range. Thus, accurate knowledge of the dielectric properties of biological tissues is fundamental to EM medical technologies. Over the past decades, numerous studies were conducted to expand the dielectric repository of biological tissues. However, dielectric data is not yet available for every tissue type and at every temperature and frequency. For this reason, dielectric measurements may be performed by researchers who are not specialists in the acquisition of tissue dielectric properties. To this end, this paper reviews the tissue dielectric measurement process performed with an open-ended coaxial probe. Given the high number of factors, including equipment-and tissue-related confounders, that can increase the measurement uncertainty or introduce errors into the tissue dielectric data, this work discusses each step of the coaxial probe measurement procedure, highlighting common practices, challenges, and techniques for controlling and compensating for confounders.

However, population genomics outlier approaches to detect selected loci may be inappropriate for clinal populations or those with unclear population structure because they require that individuals be clustered into populations. An alternate approach, landscape genomics, uses individual‐based approaches to detect loci under selection and reveal potential environmental drivers of selection. We tested four landscape genomics methods on a simulated clinal population to determine their effectiveness at identifying a locus under varying selection strengths along an environmental gradient. We found all methods produced very low type I error rates across all selection strengths, but elevated type II error rates under “weak” selection.

DNA hybridization is thus an ever-changing function of the number of strands already hybridized to the particle. Thermodynamic quantification of this behavior reveals a 3 orders of magnitude decrease in the binding constant for the capture of a free oligonucleotide by an SNA conjugate as the fraction of pre-hybridized strands increases from 0 to ∼30%. Increasing the number of pre-hybridized strands imparts an increasing enthalpic penalty to hybridization that makes binding more difficult, while simultaneously decreasing the entropic penalty to hybridization, which makes binding more favorable.

17306,"Despite recent efforts in discovering novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and unveiling their functions in a wide range of biological processes their applications as biotechnological or therapeutic tools are still at their infancy. We have recently shown that AS Uchl1, a natural lncRNA antisense to the Parkinson’s disease-associated gene Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (Uchl1), is able to increase UchL1 protein synthesis at post-transcriptional level. Its activity requires two RNA elements: an embedded inverted SINEB2 sequence to increase translation and the overlapping region to target its sense mRNA. This functional organization is shared with several mouse lncRNAs antisense to protein coding genes. The potential use of AS Uchl1-derived lncRNAs as enhancers of target mRNA translation remains unexplored. Here we define AS Uchl1 as the representative member of a new functional class of natural and synthetic antisense lncRNAs that activate translation. We named this class of RNAs SINEUPs for their requirement of the inverted SINEB2 sequence to UP-regulate translation in a gene-specific manner. The overlapping region is indicated as the Binding Doman (BD) while the embedded inverted SINEB2 element is the Effector Domain (ED). By swapping BD, synthetic SINEUPs are designed targeting mRNAs of interest. SINEUPs function in an array of cell lines and can be efficiently directed towards N-terminally tagged proteins.

17313,"Many models of new physics, including versions of supersymmetry (SUSY), predict production of events with low missing transverse energy, electroweak gauge bosons, and many energetic final-state particles. The stealth SUSY model yields this signature while conserving R-parity by means of a new hidden sector in which SUSY is approximately conserved. The results of a general search for new physics, with no requirement on missing transverse energy, in events with two photons and four or more hadronic jets are reported.

Such a programmable circuit allows a system, such as a computing machine, to modify the programmable circuit's configuration, thus eliminating the need for manually reprogramming the configuration memory. For example, if the programmable circuit is an FPGA that is part of a pipeline accelerator, a processor coupled to the accelerator can modify the configuration of the FPGA. More specifically, the processor retrieves from a configuration registry firmware that represents the modified configuration, and sends the firmware to the FPGA, which then stores the firmware in a memory such as an electrically erasable and programmable read-only memory (EEPROM).

17344,"Two metrics, a rise in serum creatinine concentration and a decrease in urine output, are considered tantamount to the injury of the kidney tubule and the epithelial cells thereof (AKI). Yet neither criterion emphasizes the etiology or the pathogenetic heterogeneity of acute decreases in kidney excretory function. In fact, whether decreased excretory function due to contraction of the extracellular fluid volume (vAKI) or due to intrinsic kidney injury (iAKI) actually share pathogenesis and should be aggregated in the same diagnostic group remains an open question.

In a mixture of two or more species, conditions are found in which the desired component is able to selectively form a crystalline structure that excludes impurity species which are unable to incorporate into the ordered lattice formed by the product. This process has been used to purify myriad organic molecules, resolve racemic mixtures with chiral additives, and even separate complex protein mixtures to arrive at samples of maximum homogeneity.[1] Without such tools to obtain materials that are uniform in their structure, function, and composition, elucidation of their chemical and physical properties would be extremely challenging and, in some cases, impossible.

17350,"OBJECTIVE: To determine (1) the association between maternal history of leiomyomas and those in women under the age of 50, and (2) the ability of subjects to report a family history of leiomyomas. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a hospital-based, case-control study. The cases were women with pathologically confirmed leiomyomas, and the controls were women with no leiomyomas after pathologic examination of the uterus or by transvaginal ultrasonography. All women were sent a questionnaire regarding potential risk factors for the development of leiomyomas. RESULTS: Eighty-one of 169 (47.9%) cases and 103 of 214 (48.1%) of controls completed the questionnaire. By multiple logistic regression, significant risk factors for the presence of leiomyomas were maternal history (odds ratio= 2.85, confidence intervals 1.25-6.52) and reduced parity (odds ratio= 0.75, confidence intervals. 57-. 98). Increasing age was nearly significant as a risk factor (odds ratio= 1.07, confidence intervals 1.00-1.15). Of the subjects, 24% did not know the maternal history of leiomyomas, while 29% and> 50% were not aware of this history in a sister or grandmother, respectively. Extended family histories of leiomyomas could not be ascertained by this questionnaire-based study. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a maternal history of leiomyomas might be the largest risk factor for development of leiomyomas in a largely Caucasian population of women.

The measurement is calibrated on samples simulated at next-to-leading order matched to a leading-order parton shower. The top quark mass is found to be 172.250.08 (stat+ JSF) 0.62 (syst) GeV. The dependence of this result on the kinematic properties of the event is studied and compared to predictions of different models of  production, and no indications of a bias in the measurements are observed.",CMS collaboration,54,6460605822625168227,arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.01428,,,,Measurement of the top quark mass with lepton+jets final states using pp collisions at  13 TeV,https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01428,,2018,/scholar?cites=6460605822625168227,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:8dk-3UP3FqQC

17394,"The Zcchc11 enzyme is implicated in microRNA (miRNA) regulation. It can uridylate let-7 precursors to decrease quantities of the mature miRNA in embryonic stem cell lines, suggested to mediate stem cell maintenance. It can uridylate mature miR-26 to relieve silencing activity without impacting miRNA content in cancer cell lines, suggested to mediate cytokine and growth factor expression. Broader roles of Zcchc11 in shaping or remodeling the miRNome or in directing biological or physiological processes remain entirely speculative. We generated Zcchc11-deficient mice to address these knowledge gaps. Zcchc11 deficiency had no impact on embryogenesis or fetal development, but it significantly decreased survival and growth immediately following birth, indicating a role for this enzyme in early postnatal fitness. Deep sequencing of small RNAs from neonatal livers revealed roles of this enzyme in miRNA sequence diversity. Zcchc11 deficiency diminished the lengths and terminal uridine frequencies for diverse mature miRNAs, but it had no influence on the quantities of any miRNAs. The expression of IGF-1, a liver-derived protein essential to early growth and survival, was enhanced by Zcchc11 expression in vitro, and miRNA silencing of IGF-1 was alleviated by uridylation events observed to be Zcchc11-dependent in the neonatal liver. In neonatal mice, Zcchc11 deficiency significantly decreased IGF-1 mRNA in the liver and IGF-1 protein in the blood.

17403,"Data from heavy ion collisions suggest that the evolution of a parton shower is modified by interactions with the color charges in the dense partonic medium created in these collisions, but it is not known where in the shower evolution the modifications occur. The momentum ratio of the two leading partons, resolved as subjets, provides information about the parton shower evolution. This substructure observable, known as the splitting function, reflects the process of a parton splitting into two other partons and has been measured for jets with transverse momentum between 140 and 500 GeV, in p p and PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair.

17427,"The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to deliver good ecological status (GES) for Europe’s waters. It prescribes the use of economic principles, such as derogation from GES on grounds of disproportionate costs of mitigation. This paper proposes an application of the proportionality principle to mitigation of phosphorus (P) pollution of 544 Scottish lochs at national and local water body scales. P loading estimates were derived from a national diffuse pollution screening tool. For 293 of these lochs (31% of the loch area), GES already occurred. Mitigation cost-effectiveness was assessed using combined mitigation cost curves for managed grassland, rough grazing, arable land, sewage and septic tank sources. These provided sufficient mitigation (92% of national P load) for GES to be achieved on another 31% of loch area at annualised cost of £2.09 m/y.

These molecules have been named SINEUPs since their function requires the activity of an embedded inverted SINEB2 sequence to UP-regulate translation. Natural SINEUPs suggest that embedded Transposable Elements may represent functional domains in long non-coding RNAs.

Two jets are required in each event, providing good sensitivity to strong production of gluinos and squarks. The search regions, sensitive to a range of different supersymmetry scenarios, are defined using the number of jets tagged as originating from bottom quarks, the sum of the magnitudes of the transverse momenta of the jets, the imbalance in the overall transverse momentum in the event, and the invariant mass of opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs. The event yields observed in data are consistent with the expected background contributions from standard model processes.

17462,"The rising and setting of the sun marks a transition between starkly contrasting environmental conditions for vegetative life. Given these differing diurnal and nocturnal environmental factors and the inherent regularity of the transition between the two, it is perhaps unsurprising that plants have developed an internal timing mechanism (known as a circadian clock) to allow modulation of gene expression and metabolism in response to external cues. Entrainment of the circadian clock, primarily via the detection of changes in light and temperature, maintains synchronization between the surrounding environment and the endogenous clock mechanism. In this review, recent advances in our understanding of the molecular workings of the plant circadian clock are discussed as are the input pathways necessary for entrainment of the clock machinery.",Matthew A Jones,44,9776328008153508295,,3,202-209,Springer-Verlag,Entrainment of the Arabidopsis circadian clock,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12374-009-9030-1.pdf,52,2009,/scholar?cites=9776328008153508295,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:aar0OkpPRdAC

17470,"The molecular-level origins of the effects of annealing temperature and molecular weight on hole mobility in P3HT are elucidated using coarse-grained molecular dynamics, quantum chemical calculations, and kinetic Monte Carlo charge-transport simulations on a variety of realistic thin-film morphologies. The zero-field hole mobility is shown to increase as the annealing temperature or average molecular weights of samples are increased, in accordance with experimental results. Crystal structure analysis shows that the annealing temperature dependence of the mobility can be attributed to the size and structural order of the crystallites in both the chain-backbone and π-stacking directions. However, the molecular weight dependence of the mobility cannot be rationalized in the same way. Longer chains are shown to belong to more crystallites in the morphology, suggesting that the crystals become better connected …",ML Jones and DM Huang and B Chakrabarti and Chris Groves,43,12775253065936553148,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,8,4240-4250,American Chemical Society,Relating molecular morphology to charge mobility in semicrystalline conjugated polymers,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b11511,120,2016,/scholar?cites=12775253065936553148,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:9VeumLvkZSQC
17471,"A search is presented for particle dark matter produced in association with a pair of top quarks in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of TeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb− 1.

No excess of events is found above the SM expectation, and upper limits are derived on the production cross section. Interpreting the findings in the context of a scalar contact interaction between fermionic dark matter particles and top quarks, lower limits on the interaction scale are set.

Using the subject of criminology as an example, the paper considers tensions that can be created when practitioners are brought into the academy to contribute directly in the curriculum. The paper advocates that whilst such difficulties cannot be underestimated, academic engagement in this agenda can be beneficial. Using a brief example it will be argued that creative use of practitioner discourses not only empowers students in their career planning but can be used to facilitate student understanding of the links between critical theory and practice.

17474,"The collection of a large number of B-hadron decays to hadronic final states at the CDF II Detector is possible due to the presence of a trigger that selects events based on track impact parameters. However, the nature of the selection requirements of the trigger introduces a large bias in the observed proper-decay-time distribution. A lifetime measurement must correct for this bias, and the conventional approach has been to use a Monte Carlo simulation. The leading sources of systematic uncertainty in the conventional approach are due to differences between the data and the Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper, we present an analytic method for bias correction without using simulation, thereby removing any uncertainty due to the differences between data and simulation.

17479,An under voltage lockout {overscore (RESET)} circuit is connected to the {overscore (RESET)} terminal of a EEPROM. The EEPROM is used in a system which may include a computer or processor and which may be used in space. The under voltage lockout {overscore (RESET)} circuit maybe an under voltage lockout circuit used on a LinFinity SG1526/B or a Unitrode UC1526 regulating pulse width modulator which maintain the {overscore (RESET)} voltage low at all values of power supply voltage source voltage less than a predetermined level.

17501,"This paper discusses the impact of tissue dehydration on the dielectric properties of excised tissue samples. The effect of dehydration on the tissue surface has been characterized as a function of time after excision on freshly excised mouse liver. The dielectric properties of liver were measured over the frequency range of 500 MHz–20 GHz using an open-ended coaxial probe. Tissue samples were obtained from 7 athymic BALB/c Nude mice, and measurements were performed over the first 3.5 h post-excision at the tissue surface and in the middle of the sample (accessed via a small incision).

Currently, no conservation treatment exists that effectively addresses all three issues simultaneously.

Surprisingly, however, there are few histological correlates of such damage.

17526,"A search for gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) in final states with photons and large missing transverse momentum is presented. The data sample of pp collisions at s= 13 TeV was collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1. Data are compared with models in which the lightest neutralino has bino-or wino-like components, resulting in decays to photons and gravitinos, where the gravitinos escape detection.

17553,"Background: The aim was to describe the management of benign gallbladder disease and identify characteristics associated with all-cause 30-day readmissions and complications in a prospective population-based cohort.Methods: Data were collected on consecutive patients undergoing cholecystectomy in acute UK and Irish hospitals between 1 March and 1 May 2014. Potential explanatory variables influencing all-cause 30-day readmissions and complications were analysed by means of multilevel, multivariable logistic regression modelling using a two-level hierarchical structure with patients (level 1) nested within hospitals (level 2).Results: Data were collected on 8909 patients undergoing cholecystectomy from 167 hospitals. Some 1451 cholecystectomies (16⋅ 3 per cent) were performed as an emergency, 4165 (46⋅ 8 per cent) as elective operations, and 3293 patients (37⋅ 0 per cent) had had at least one previous emergency admission, but had surgery on a delayed basis. The readmission and complication rates at 30 days were 7⋅ 1 per cent (633 of 8909) and 10⋅ 8 per cent (962 of 8909) respectively. Both readmissions and complications were independently associated with increasing ASA fitness grade, duration of surgery, and increasing numbers of emergency admissions with gallbladder disease before cholecystectomy.

As predicted, after experiencing sexual coercion, adolescents reported increased externalizing symptoms, more frequent sexual intercourse and a greater total number of intercourse partners.

17561,The endohedral fullerene Er3N@C80 shows characteristic 1.5 μm photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures associated with radiative relaxation from the crystal-field split Er3+4I13/2 manifold to the 4I15/2 manifold. Previous observations of this luminescence were carried out by photoexcitation of the fullerene cage states leading to relaxation via the ionic states. We present direct non-cage-mediated optical interaction with the erbium ion. We have used this interaction to complete a photoluminescence-excitation map of the Er3+4I13/2 manifold. This ability to interact directly with the states of an incarcerated ion suggests the possibility of coherently manipulating fullerene qubit states with light.,Mark AG Jones and RA Taylor and A Ardavan and K Porfyrakis and GAD Briggs,36,18206202424293952964,Chemical physics letters,4-6,303-306,North-Holland,Direct optical excitation of a fullerene-incarcerated metal ion,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261406009596,428,2006,/scholar?cites=18206202424293952964,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:_cFkbNEifk0C
17562,"Vascular smooth muscle cell polyploidization occurs during normal development and is enhanced under physiologic stress, but the mechanism of this cell cycle has not been explored. We show via time-lapse video imaging and immunofluorescence analyses that primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) undergo an endomitotic-type cell cycle, including a normal progression through part of mitosis. Mononuclear polyploid cells are generated by defects in sister chromatid separation and/or segregation, and cellular binucleation occurs by reversal of cytokinesis. To obtain further leads to regulators involved, we examined the chromosomal passenger proteins, Aurora B, inner centromere protein and Survivin, and concluded that Aurora B and inner centromere protein are normally colocalized in centromeres, the midzone, and the midbody during mitosis.

Whether a drug-resistant mutant grows to high densities, and so sickens the patient and spreads to new hosts, is determined by the competitive interactions it has with drug-susceptible pathogens within the host. Competitive interactions thus represent a good target for resistance management strategies. Using an in vivo model of malaria infection, we show that limiting a resource that is disproportionately required by resistant parasites retards the evolution of drug resistance by intensifying competitive interactions between susceptible and resistant parasites.

RasV12 cells are eliminated apically, suggesting that extrusion may be a tumor-suppressive process. Extrusion depends on E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions and signaling to the actin-myosin cytoskeleton [2, 6]. However, the signals underlying detection of the RasV12 cell and triggering extrusion are poorly understood. Here we identify differential EphA2 signaling as the mechanism by which RasV12 cells are detected in epithelial cell sheets. Cell-cell interactions between normal cells and RasV12 cells trigger ephrin-A-EphA2 signaling, which induces a cell repulsion response in RasV12 cells.

17618,"Background The optimal timing of cholecystectomy for patients admitted with acute gallbladder pathology is unclear. Some studies have shown that emergency cholecystectomy during the index admission can reduce length of hospital stay with similar rates of conversion to open surgery, complications and mortality compared with a ‘delayed’ operation following discharge. Others have reported that cholecystectomy during the index acute admission results in higher morbidity, extended length of stay and increased costs. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of emergency versus delayed cholecystectomy for acute benign gallbladder disease. Methods Using data from a prospective population-based cohort study examining the outcomes of cholecystectomy in the UK and Ireland, a model-based cost–utility analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, with a 1-year time horizon for costs and outcomes. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the impact of parameter uncertainty on the results obtained from the model. Results Emergency cholecystectomy was found to be less costly (£4570 versus £4720; €5484 versus €5664) and more effective (0·8868 versus 0·8662 QALYs) than delayed cholecystectomy. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the emergency strategy is more than 60 per cent likely to be cost-effective across willingness-to-pay values for the QALY from £0 to £100 000 (€0–120 000). Conclusion Emergency cholecystectomy is less costly and more effective than delayed cholecystectomy.

17626," Methodologies analysing individual practice in health care: a systematic review  Aim of the review. The aim of the systematic review was to identify, explore and evaluate the current level of knowledge of methodologies used in comparative analyses of the individual practice of doctors, nurses and midwives. Rationale. The question of how roles and responsibilities might be shared differently between professional groups in order to promote improved, cost‐effective health care requires a systematic analysis of existing roles and practice. To do this effectively, knowledge of the methodologies available for such an analysis is essential. Methods. A systematic review of the literature published since 1989 comparing the practice of doctors, nurses and midwives was undertaken.

17631,"It is Chantal Mouffe’s contention that the central weakness of consensus-driven forms of liberalism, such as John Rawls’ political liberalism and Jurgen Habermas’ deliberative democracy, is that they refuse to acknowledge conflict and pluralism, especially at the level of the ontological. Their defence for doing so is that conflict and pluralism are the result of attempts to incorporate unreasonable and irrational claims into the public political sphere. In this context, unreasonable and irrational claims are those that cannot be translated into universalizable terms. However, for Mouffe, it is this intentional exclusionary act itself that is detrimental to a wellfunctioning democratic polity.

The internal structure of these fullerenes can be spatially aligned with a preferred orientation under high magnetic field; the effect of alignment is to reduce the broadening associated with the isotropic spatial averaging characteristic of powder or frozen‐solution spectra. Using a tunable 1.5 μm laser, we directly observe non‐cage‐mediated optical interactions with the Er3+ ion.

Besides the walking interaction among pedestrians, the interaction between pedestrians and the built environment in which they are walking also have greatest relevance. Force-based models were compared with the other three major microscopic models of pedestrian simulation to demonstrate a more realistic and capable heuristic approach is needed for the study of the dynamics of pedestrians.",Wenbo Ma and Prasad KDV Yarlagadda,27,15582425040924605158,Journal of Urban Planning and Development,3,04014030,American Society of Civil Engineers,Pedestrian dynamics in real and simulated world,https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000232,141,2015,/scholar?cites=15582425040924605158,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:wRp7bqO99tsC

17688,"A general search for the pair production of resonances, each decaying to two quarks, is reported. The search is conducted separately for heavier resonances (masses above 400 GeV), where each of the four final-state quarks generates a hadronic jet resulting in a four-jet signature, and for lighter resonances (masses between 80 and 400 GeV), where the pair of quarks from each resonance is collimated and reconstructed as a single jet resulting in a two-jet signature. In addition, a b-tagged selection is applied to target resonances with a bottom quark in the final state.

17690,"Activation of T lymphocytes requires a tight regulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression. Terminal uridyltransferases (TUTases) catalyze 3′ nontemplated nucleotide addition (3′NTA) to miRNAs, which may influence miRNA stability and function. Here, we investigated 3′NTA to mature miRNA in CD4 T lymphocytes by deep sequencing. Upon T-cell activation, miRNA sequences bearing terminal uridines are specifically decreased, concomitantly with down-regulation of TUT4 and TUT7 enzymes. Analyzing TUT4-deficient T lymphocytes, we proved that this terminal uridyltransferase is essential for the maintenance of miRNA uridylation in the steady state of T lymphocytes. Analysis of synthetic uridylated miRNAs shows that 3′ addition of uridine promotes degradation of these uridylated miRNAs after T-cell activation.

Assuming time-reversal invariance, this asymmetry is strictly zero for one-photon exchange. A nonzero A y can arise from the interference between the one-and two-photon exchange processes which is sensitive to the details of the substructure of the nucleon. An experiment recently completed at Jefferson Lab yielded asymmetries with high statistical precision at Q 2= 0.13, 0.46, and 0.97 GeV 2.

17700,"Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disease, the progression of which is modulated by several factors, including inflammation and hypercholesterolemia. The A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) has been reported to affect mast cell degranulation leading to inflammation, as well as to influence cardiovascular homeostasis. Here, we show that its deletion can also impact vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation in vitro. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that A3AR deficiency would affect atheromatous lesion development in vivo.

17712,"Numerous diseases of wildlife have recently emerged due to trade and travel. However, the impact of disease on wild animal populations has been notoriously difficult to detect and demonstrate, due to problems of attribution and the rapid disappearance of bodies after death. Determining the magnitude of avian mortality from West Nile virus (WNV) is emblematic of these challenges. Although correlational analyses have shown population declines coincident with the arrival of the virus, strong inference of WNV as a cause of mortality or a population decline requires additional evidence. We show how integrating field data on mosquito feeding patterns, avian abundance, and seroprevalence can be used to predict relative mortality from vector-borne pathogens.

17726,"The study of acoustic vibrations in nanoparticles provides unique and unparalleled insight into their mechanical properties. Electron-beam lithography of nanostructures allows precise manipulation of their acoustic vibration frequencies through control of nanoscale morphology. However, the dissipation of acoustic vibrations in this important class of nanostructures has not yet been examined. Here we report, using single-particle ultrafast transient extinction spectroscopy, the intrinsic damping dynamics in lithographically fabricated plasmonic nanostructures. We find that in stark contrast to chemically synthesized, monocrystalline nanoparticles, acoustic energy dissipation in lithographically fabricated nanostructures is solely dominated by intrinsic damping.

17754,"The Tudor warship the Mary Rose has reached an important transition point in her conservation. The 19 year long process of spraying with polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been completed (April 29th 2013) and the hull is air drying under tightly controlled conditions. Acidophilic bacteria capable of oxidising iron and sulfur have been previously identified and enriched from unpreserved timbers of the Mary Rose, demonstrating that biological pathways of iron and sulfur oxidization existed potentially in this wood, before preservation with PEG. This study was designed to establish if the recycled PEG spray system was a reservoir of microorganisms capable of iron and sulfur oxidization during preservation of the Mary Rose. Microbial enrichments derived from PEG impregnated biofilm collected from underneath the Mary Rose hull, were examined to better understand the processes of cycling of iron. X-ray absorption spectroscopy was utilised to demonstrate the biological contribution to production of sulfuric acid in the wood. Using molecular microbiological techniques to examine these enrichment cultures, PEG was found to mediate a shift in the microbial community from a co-culture of Stenotrophomonas and Brevunidimonas sp, to a co-culture of Stenotrophomonas and the iron oxidising Alicyclobacillus sp. Evidence is presented that PEG is not an inert substance in relation to the redox cycling of iron. This is the first demonstration that solutions of PEG used in the conservation of the Mary Rose are promoting the oxidation of ferrous iron in acidic solutions, in which spontaneous abiotic oxidation does not occur in water.

17764,"TO THE EDITOR: We present the case of a person with HIV and hepatitis C coinfection who developed diplopia while being treated with citalopram. Since citalopram was developed in 1989, it has been used in more than 65 countries, with a total estimated worldwide exposure of 8 million persons. Its use is extensive, and its safety is well established. 1–4 Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is N-demethylated partially by cytochrome P450 2C19 and partially by cytochrome P450 3A4. The fact that citalopram is metabolized by more than one cytochrome P450 isoenzyme suggests that inhibition of its biotransformation by other drugs is less likely. 2 In addition, citalopram has little or no affinity for acetylcholine, histamine, norepinephrine, dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), or opiate receptors. Citalopram has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, exhibiting high bioavailability, linear pharmacokinetics, and low protein binding. Citalopram’s minimal effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system has made it tolerable for patients with comorbid medical illnesses who are taking a variety of other medications.We searched MEDLINE (1966–2003), OVID, PsychInfo, Psycharticles, and EBM Cochrane. We found no reports on citalopram and diplopia. Information on citalopram’s side effect profile is available from controlled and uncontrolled studies as well as postmarketing surveillance reports. Several meta-analyses have also been conducted. 3, 4 The most common side effects reported with citalopram are nausea and vomiting (20%), increased sweating (18%), headache (18%), dry mouth (17%), tremor (16%), sedation (15 …",Karin Dorell and Mary Ann Cohen and Shirish S Huprikar and Jack M Gorman and Makeda Jones,23,5879025736150722330,Psychosomatics,1,91-93,Elsevier,Citalopram-induced diplopia,http://www.academia.edu/download/49371685/appi.psy.46.1.9120161005-27752-nm1mqn.pdf,46,2005,/scholar?cites=5879025736150722330,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:eJD0kABLposC

We investigate the sharp fiscal consolidation over the past five years and examine why it did not reduce the current account deficit. We show that a disproportionate part of the fiscal consolidation was achieved by cutting public investment spending, and we discuss some of the negative consequences of such cuts. We compare the macroeconomic behaviour of six OECD countries which have recently increased net government savings. It has been a common experience that an increase in net government saving has not been associated with a reduction in the current account deficit. For Australia, we establish that the link between fiscal consolidation and a smaller current account deficit was severed by a private sector investment surge.

17776,"Results are reported from a search for physics beyond the standard model in proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s= 13 TeV. The search uses a signature of a single lepton, large jet and bottom quark jet multiplicities, and high sum of large-radius jet masses, without any requirement on the missing transverse momentum in an event.

17804,"The evolution of drug resistance, a key challenge for our ability to treat and control infections, depends on two processes: de-novo resistance mutations, and the selection for and spread of resistant mutants within a population. Understanding the factors influencing the rates of these two processes is essential for maximizing the useful lifespan of drugs and, therefore, effective disease control. For malaria parasites, artemisinin-based drugs are the frontline weapons in the fight against disease, but reports from the field of slower parasite clearance rates during drug treatment are generating concern that the useful lifespan of these drugs may be limited. Whether slower clearance rates represent true resistance, and how this provides a selective advantage for parasites is uncertain. Here, we show that Plasmodium chabaudi malaria parasites selected for resistance to artesunate (an artemisinin derivative) through a step-wise increase in drug dose evolved slower clearance rates extremely rapidly. In single infections, these slower clearance rates, similar to those seen in the field, provided fitness advantages to the parasite through increased overall density, recrudescence after treatment and increased transmission potential. In mixed infections, removal of susceptible parasites by drug treatment led to substantial increases in the densities and transmission potential of resistant parasites (competitive release). Our results demonstrate the double-edged sword for resistance management: in our initial selection experiments, no parasites survived aggressive chemotherapy, but after selection, the fitness advantage for resistant parasites was greatest at high …",Laura C Pollitt and Silvie Huijben and Derek G Sim and Rahel M Salathé and Matthew J Jones and Andrew F Read,21,17512115111783346677,PLoS Pathog,4,e1004019,Public Library of Science,"Rapid response to selection, competitive release and increased transmission potential of artesunate-selected Plasmodium chabaudi malaria parasites",https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004019,10,2014,/scholar?cites=17512115111783346677,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:ybgmOu3m07wC

17813,"Recent years have witnessed a burgeoning of work on ‘relational space’—a perspective that sees spatiality as unbounded and formed through the imbroglios of non-territorial flows and networks. According to its advocates, this challenges territorial and scalar readings of space, by insisting on an open-ended, mobile, and actor-centred politics of geographic becoming. The paper discusses the importance of, and limits to, this paradigmatic thinking through an historical engagement on how we have conceptualised ‘regions in geography’, pitched alongside a dialogue on the shifting philosophies of space. It then offers a different take on regions by talking about ‘phase spatiality’. Drawing on developments in the philosophy of the physical and natural sciences,‘phase space’, amongst other things, expresses the spatiotemporal becoming of regions from a topological stance but insists on the compatibilities between …",Martin Jones,21,11309874704770250719,"Regional Studies Association Conference Regional Growth Agendas, Aalborg, Denmark",,,,"Towards “Phase Spatiality”: Regions, Regional Studies, and the Limits to Thinking Space Relationally",http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11309874704770250719&hl=en&oi=scholarr,2831,2005,/scholar?cites=11309874704770250719,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:KHHIWZcdS5cC

HE) programs and on how teachers perceived students' reflective activity and facilitated their associated learning needs. The main methods of collecting data about experiences and perceptions of learning contexts were interviewing and participant observation, supplemented by documentary evidence. Two case study centers were chosen--one on its first intake of Dip. HE students and another with 3 years' experience of Dip. HE. Findings indicated that the formal use of"" reflection"" was new to a number of established teachers and most students. Teachers emphasized the hope that reflection would increase understanding, develop self-awareness, enhance the ability to analyze, encourage deeper thinking, and promote independence. The settings teachers were using to facilitate reflection were chiefly group sessions, individual tutorials, clinical interactions, and learning journals. Teachers described and illustrated a sequence of four stages of reflection in helping students to link theory and practice: describing aspects of their practical experience, analyzing them, understanding how the situation could have been different, and seeing how they could behave in a future similar occurrence.

17821,"Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LP-TEM) is a powerful characterization tool for probing the dynamics of nanometer-scale systems in a solvated environment. When the energetic electron beam (80–300 kV) interacts with the solvent, radiolysis occurs, generating highly reactive species that interact with the sample. While these species are often considered harmful and great efforts are taken to mitigate their influence, many of these radiolytic products, such as hydroxyl radicals and solvated electrons, are crucially relevant to several areas of energy research. In this Perspective, we propose a paradigm shift wherein solvent-derived, reactive radiolytic species generated by the electron beam are viewed as a tool for rational chemical perturbation of a material system rather than as a source of error to minimize.

Through the teachers’ own voices an illustration of their learning processes is presented, and the gap between what is supported by their school and the activities they engage in becomes evident. Because their learning needs about technology integration were insufficiently supported through formal learning opportunities, these teachers augmented these activities with informal and independent activities.

17845,"Very little is known about how vector-borne pathogens interact within their vector and how this impacts transmission. Here we show that mosquitoes can accumulate mixed strain malaria infections after feeding on multiple hosts. We found that parasites have a greater chance of establishing and reach higher densities if another strain is already present in a mosquito. Mixed infections contained more parasites but these larger populations did not have a detectable impact on vector survival. Together these results suggest that mosquitoes taking multiple infective bites may disproportionally contribute to malaria transmission. This will increase rates of mixed infections in vertebrate hosts, with implications for the evolution of parasite virulence and the spread of drug-resistant strains. Moreover, control measures that reduce parasite prevalence in vertebrate hosts will reduce the likelihood of mosquitoes taking multiple infective feeds, and thus disproportionally reduce transmission. More generally, our study shows that the types of strain interactions detected in vertebrate hosts cannot necessarily be extrapolated to vectors.",Laura C Pollitt and Joshua T Bram and Simon Blanford and Matthew J Jones and Andrew F Read,19,15247323324888579240,PLoS pathogens,7,e1005003,Public Library of Science,Existing infection facilitates establishment and density of malaria parasites in their mosquito vector,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005003,11,2015,/scholar?cites=15247323324888579240,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:_5f0VhOe6mUC

17865,"Background: The aims of this prospective population-based cohort study were to identify the patient and hospital characteristics associated with emergency cholecystectomy, and the influences of these in determining variations between hospitals.Methods: Data were collected for consecutive patients undergoing cholecystectomy in acute UK and Irish hospitals between 1 March and 1 May 2014. Potential explanatory variables influencing the performance of emergency cholecystectomy were analysed by means of multilevel, multivariable logistic regression modelling using a two-level hierarchical structure with patients (level 1) nested within hospitals (level 2).Results: Data were collected on 4744 cholecystectomies from 165 hospitals. Increasing age, lower ASA fitness grade, biliary colic, the need for further imaging (magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography), endoscopic interventions (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) and admission to a non-biliary centre significantly reduced the likelihood of an emergency cholecystectomy being performed. The multilevel model was used to calculate the probability of receiving an emergency cholecystectomy for a woman aged 40 years or over with an ASA grade of I or II and a BMI of at least 25⋅ 0 kg/m2, who presented with acute cholecystitis with an ultrasound scan showing a thick-walled gallbladder and a normal common bile duct. The mean predicted probability of receiving an emergency cholecystectomy was 0⋅ 52 (95 per cent ci 0⋅ 45 to 0⋅ 57).

17866,"Introduction Screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) in primary care has been recommended; however, the views of healthcare professionals (HCPs) are not known. This study aimed to determine the opinions of HCP about the feasibility of implementing screening within a primary care setting.   Methods A cross-sectional mixed methods census survey of 418 HCPs from 59 inner-city practices (Nottingham, UK) was conducted between October-December 2014. Postal and web-surveys ascertained data on existing methods, knowledge, skills, attitudes, barriers and facilitators to AF screening using Likert scale and open-ended questions. Responses, categorized according to HCP group, were summarized using proportions, adjusting for clustering by practice, with 95% C.Is and free-text responses using thematic analysis.   Results At least one General Practitioner (GP) responded from 48 (81%) practices. There were 212/418 (51%) respondents; 118/229 GPs, 67/129 nurses [50 practice nurses; 17 Nurse Practitioners (NPs)], 27/60 healthcare assistants (HCAs). 39/48 (81%) practices had an ECG machine and diagnosed AF in-house. Non-GP HCPs reported having less knowledge about ECG interpretation, diagnosing and treating AF than GPs. A greater proportion of non-GP HCPs reported they would benefit from ECG training specifically for AF diagnosis than GPs [proportion (95% CI) GPs: 11.9% (6.8–20.0); HCAs: 37.0% (21.7–55.5); nurses: 44.0% (30.0–59.0); NPs 41.2% (21.9–63.7)].

17868,"Monte Carlo simulations are used to examine charge-transfer (CT) state recombination dynamics considering the effects of energetic disorder and bulk heterojunction morphology. Strongly biexponential recombination kinetics were observed, in agreement with spectroscopy. Data over a range of electric fields 106 ≤ F ≤ 108 V m–1 suggest that the slow component of recombination is due to energetic and spatial trapping of charges, as increasing the field reduces the magnitude of the slow decay. This behavior could not be described using a simple Onsager–Braun type model; hence, an alternative kinetic framework including an intermediate “quasi-free” state between the CT state and free charges is proposed and subsequently shown to fit the MC data very well. The predictive capability of the modified model was then tested by repeating MC simulations with an altered recombination rate.

17878,"The purpose of the present report was to estimate the population parameters of cortisol concentrations in urine, an endogenous hormone used as a ‘doping’ agent and for which an international threshold (1.0 μg/ml) has been proposed. Two data bases (French and UK) corresponding to 112 and 142 samples, respectively were considered. Urine was collected under specific post competition conditions. Cortisol concentrations were obtained by validated methods (HPLC for the French samples, and GC‐MS for UK samples). No difference was observed between the 2 data sets and statistical analyses were carried out on the two merged flies. The overall geometric mean cortisol concentration was 48 ng/ml.

17894,"The role of the inhibitory region of troponin (Tn) I in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction was studied with three deletion mutants of its inhibitory region: 1) complete (TnI-(Δ96–116)), 2) the COOH-terminal domain (TnI-(Δ105–115)), and 3) the NH2-terminal domain (TnI-(Δ95–106)). Measurements of Ca2+-regulated force and relaxation were performed in skinned skeletal muscle fibers whose endogenous TnI (along with TnT and TnC) was displaced with high concentrations of added troponin T. Reconstitution of the Tn-displaced fibers with a TnI·TnC complex restored the Ca2+ sensitivity of force; however, the levels of relaxation and force development varied. Relaxation of the fibers (pCa 8) was drastically impaired with two of the inhibitory region deletion mutants, TnI-(Δ96–116)·TnC and TnI-(Δ105–115)·TnC.

17898,"The current study explored the potential for an empirically supported taxonomy of gendered racial identity among Black women sampled in the United States. Drawing from Black racial identity theory (Sellers et al. 1998a), gendered racial identity was defined as the significance and qualitative meaning women attribute to their membership within Black and woman social identity groups. To assess this construct, Black women (n = 240; M age = 35.83, SD = 11.88, range = 19–79) completed measures of racial and gender centrality as well as an opened-ended question assessing the meaning assigned to one’s intersected identity.

An eight-week clinical trial was conducted to evaluate change in tooth color by a silica-based, enamel-safe tartar control whitening dentifrice compared to a marketed baking soda dentifrice control. First, a screening exercise was conducted to identify individuals with long-standing extrinsic dental stain. This exercise targeted adults who reported"" stained teeth"" and coffee/tea drinking or smoking, but who had no recent history of dental prophylaxis. Targeted subjects were examined for stain (Lobene Index) and tooth shade/color (Vita). A total of 291 adults having extrinsic stain and discolored teeth were enrolled in the study. Subjects were randomized to one of the two treatment groups, and all dentifrice use was unsupervised. Tooth color was measured at 4 and 8 weeks from shade values collected from the 8 incisors, and averages were determined from a linear ordering of the shade guide. A total of 278 evaluable subjects completed the 8-week study. Overall, the tartar control whitening dentifrice group experienced an improvement in color, differing statistically from baseline (p< 0.001) and from the marketed control (p< 0.05). Safety profiles for the two dentifrices were generally similar. Among patients with long-standing extrinsic stain, use of the tartar control whitening dentifrice resulted in superior overall tooth shade and reduced maximum or worst color compared to the marketed baking soda dentifrice control.",RW Gerlach and ML Barker and JD Hyde and MB Jones and RE Cordero,16,15469141868486905111,The Journal of clinical dentistry,2,47-50,,Effects of a tartar control whitening dentifrice on tooth shade in a population with long-standing natural stain.,https://europepmc.org/article/med/11476014,12,2001,/scholar?cites=15469141868486905111,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:5Klqo5HVOaoC

17910,"A total of 311 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from human adult testis have been assigned to human chromosomes by Southern analysis of a monochromosome somatic cell hybrid panel. Over 70% of the ESTs show conservation to hamster and mouse DNA, and the overall distribution of transcripts correlates well with physical chromosome size and to a greater extent with male meiotic chromosome length. The notable exception is the X chromosome, for which the number of testis- derived ESTs is greatly underrepresented. This finding may reflect inactivation of the X chromosome during the meiotic phase of spermatogenesis and a consequent selection against large numbers of X-linked germ cell transcripts. Further analysis of the distribution of testis ESTs showed that the EST density remains significantly correlated with the recombination density of each autosome.

17912,"The lack of a strong correlation between AGN X-ray luminosity (LX; a proxy for AGN power) and the star formation rate (SFR) of their host galaxies has recently been attributed to stochastic AGN variability. Studies using population synthesis models have incorporated this by assuming a broad, universal (i.e. does not depend on the host galaxy properties) probability distribution for AGN specific X-ray luminosities (i.e. the ratio of LX to host stellar mass; a common proxy for Eddington ratio). However, recent studies have demonstrated that this universal Eddington ratio distribution fails to reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions beyond z ∼ 1.2. Furthermore, empirical studies have recently shown that the Eddington ratio distribution may instead depend upon host galaxy properties, such as SFR and/or stellar mass.

17921,"A search for new physics using three-lepton (trilepton) data collected with the CDF II detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 976 pb− 1 is presented. The standard model predicts a low rate of trilepton events, which makes some supersymmetric processes, such as chargino-neutralino production, measurable in this channel. The μ μ+ ℓ signature is investigated, where ℓ is an electron or a muon, with the additional requirement of large missing transverse energy.

17922,"Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) have shown high West Nile virus (WNV) seroprevalence, and WNV infection has been suggested as a cause of morbidity and mortality in this species. We experimentally infected nine eastern gray squirrels with WNV to determine the clinical effects of infection and to assess their potential role as amplifying hosts. We observed no morbidity or mortality attributable to WNV infection, but lesions were apparent in several organs. We detected mean viremias of 105.1 and 104.8 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL on days 3 and 4 post-infection (DPI) and estimated that ~2.1% of Culex pipiens feeding on squirrels during 1–5 DPI would become infectious. Thus, S. carolinensis are unlikely to be important amplifying hosts and may instead dampen the intensity of transmission in most host communities.

This nitrogen radical displays predominantly axial symmetry characteristics as expected for a monoadduct, evidenced by a zero-field splitting D parameter of 6.6 MHz and an E parameter of 0.5 MHz in powder at 77 K. Photo- and thermally-activated silencing of the nitrogen radical were observed, the latter showing the evolution of a new spin signal during heating at 100 °C.

The generation of proteolytic molecules, such as plasmin, may be important in the pathogenesis of endocarditis caused by S. mutans. In this study, we demonstrate that S. mutans cells have the ability to bind and activate plasminogen to plasmin. Incubation of S. mutans cells with plasminogen was found to be sufficient for the activation of plasminogen, which suggests the presence of an endogenously produced plasminogen activator. The plasmin activity generated by S. mutans cells was shown to be inhibited by ε-aminocaproic acid, lysine, aprotinin, and α2-macroglobulin.

Superconducting properties have been successfully induced in the films by a postdeposition, ex-situ static annealing process in a F2/N2 gas mixture. The influence of the fluorination temperature on the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of the resulting thin films has been examined in detail. X-ray data reveal that facile fluorination of the films proceeds via a complex, multistage process, often yielding two distinct La2CuO4-type phases. This phase segregation suggests a disproportionation process following fluorine uptake. Such a disproportionation is subtly different from that found for oxygen excess La2CuO4 in that for La2CuO4+δ the parent O4 and an oxygen rich (O4+δ) phase are formed, but in the present system two fluorinated (i.e., oxidized) phases are formed.

17938,"Results are presented from a search for supersymmetry in events with a single electron or muon and hadronic jets. The data correspond to a sample of proton–proton collisions at s= 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1, recorded in 2016 by the CMS experiment. A number of exclusive search regions are defined according to the number of jets, the number of b-tagged jets, the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the jets, and the scalar sum of the missing transverse momentum and the transverse momentum of the lepton. Standard model background events are reduced significantly by requiring a large azimuthal angle between the direction of the lepton and of the reconstructed W boson, computed under the hypothesis that all of the missing transverse momentum in the event arises from a neutrino produced in the leptonic decay of the W boson.

Analyzing pneumococci collected from children in Massachusetts, we found that the activation of macrophage NF-κB by Streptococcus pneumoniae is highly diverse, with a preponderance of low NF-κB activators that associate particularly with complicated pneumonia. Low NF-κB activators cause more severe lung infections in mice, and they drive macrophages toward an alternate and detrimental cell fate of necroptosis.

The data were taken with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron at √s=1.96 TeV. We find that as pT increases, the pT slopes of the three mesons (KS0, K±, and φ) are similar. And using our previous Λ0 results from minimum bias events, we show that the ratio of Λ0 to KS0 as a function of pT in minimum bias events becomes similar to the fairly constant ratio in jets at pT∼5 GeV/c. This suggests that the particles with pTâ‰35 GeV/c in minimum bias events are from >soft> jets, and that the pT slope of particles in jets is insensitive to light quark flavor (u, d, or s) and to the number of valence quarks.

Following platelet activation, the majority of released PrPC was detected as a disulphide linked high molecular weight complex, which under reducing conditions could be separated into what appear to be stable non-disulphide linked PrP dimers or PrP covalently linked to another as yet unidentified protein. This phenomenon appears to be unique to activation since only monomeric PrPC was detected following lysis of resting platelets.

17995,"The circadian system optimizes cellular responses to stress, but the signaling pathways that convey the metabolic consequences of stress into this molecular timekeeping mechanism remain unclear. Redox regulation of the SAL1 phosphatase during abiotic stress initiates a signaling pathway from chloroplast to nucleus by regulating the accumulation of a metabolite, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP). Consequently, PAP accumulates in response to redox stress and inhibits the activity of exoribonucleases (XRNs) in the nucleus and cytosol. We demonstrated that osmotic stress induces a lengthening of circadian period and that genetically inducing the SAL1-PAP-XRN pathway in plants lacking either SAL1 or XRNs similarly delays the circadian system. Exogenous application of PAP was also sufficient to extend circadian period.

18001,"Recent work has led to the hypothesis that kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin (KNDy) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) play a key role in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generation and gonadal steroid feedback, with kisspeptin driving GnRH release and neurokinin B and dynorphin acting as pulse start and stop signals, respectively. A separate cell group, expressing RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3) has been shown to be a primary inhibitor of GnRH release. Very little is known regarding these cell groups in the bovine. In this study, we examined the relative immunoreactivity of kisspeptin, dynorphin, and RFRP-3 and their possible connectivity to GnRH neurons in the hypothalami of periestrus and diestrus bovine. While GnRH and RFRP-3 immunoreactivity were unchanged, kisspeptin and dynorphin immunoreactivity levels varied in relation to plasma progesterone concentrations and estrous status. Animals with higher plasma progesterone concentrations in diestrus had lower kisspeptin and increased dynorphin immunoreactivity in the ARC. The percentage of GnRH cells with kisspeptin or RFRP-3 fibers in close apposition did not differ between estrous stages. However, the proportions of GnRH cells with kisspeptin or RFRP-3 contacts (∼ 49.8% and∼ 31.3%, respectively) suggest direct communication between kisspeptin and RFRP-3 cells to GnRH cells in the bovine.

Here we show that by combining lithographic techniques with DNA-based self-assembly methods, we can construct responsive plasmonic metamaterials that exhibit the plasmonic analog of an effect known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which can dramatically change their spectra upon motion of their constituent parts. Correlative scanning electron microscopy measurements, scattering dark-field microscopy, and computational simulations are performed on single assemblies to determine the relationship between their structures and spectral responses to a …",David B Litt and Matthew R Jones and Mario Hentschel and Ying Wang and Sui Yang and Hyun Dong Ha and Xiang Zhang and A Paul Alivisatos,11,4290891100966329764,Nano letters,2,859-864,American Chemical Society,Hybrid lithographic and DNA-directed assembly of a configurable plasmonic metamaterial that exhibits electromagnetically induced transparency,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b04116,18,2018,/scholar?cites=4290891100966329764,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:Ye8fVhOjtu8C
18026,"In bacterial pneumonia, lung damage resulting from epithelial cell injury is a major contributor to the severity of disease and, in some cases, can lead to long-term sequelae, especially in the setting of severe lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the IL-6 cytokine family, is a critical determinant of lung tissue protection during pneumonia, but the cellular sources of LIF and the signaling pathways leading to its production in the infected lung are not known. Here, we demonstrate that lung epithelium, specifically alveolar type II cells, is the predominant site of LIF transcript induction in pneumonic mouse lungs. Epithelial cell cultures were induced to express LIF by bacteria and by sterile bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from pneumonic mice.

By this means I have been able to examine the literacy of a group of readers in a specific region.  This thesis is divided into three main parts.  The first describes the spproach taken, and critically assesses the field of historical literacy before examining the value to the study of modern theories of literacy.  It includes an overview of late-medieval medical practice in order to place the manuscripts in their immediate context.  The second section consists of a detailed examination of the primary material and presents a corpus of some thirty-seven manuscripts dating from the nid-fourteenth to the late-fifteenth centuries.  Each manuscript is described in terms of its physical appearance and the types of texts it contains.  Provenance information is supplied for owners and readers in the Middle Ages.  The third section draws together these findings in the light of the literacy theories adopted, analysing the information in terms of the types of text included (both medical and non-medical), the types of book (whether basic or luxurious productions), and the types of owner (graduate physicians, rural practitioners or interested laypeople).

The objective of this study is to compare the impact of early and late reconstruction of complete unilateral cleft lip and palate on the growth and development of the front of the dentoalveolar arch. Methods. This study was carried out in the years 2012–2015 at the Clinic of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery in Banska Bystrica. Infants with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate were divided into 2 groups according to the timing of lip reconstruction. Group A consisted of infants with early lip reconstruction–realised in the first 14 days of life. Group B consisted of infants with later lip reconstruction–realised in the third month of age. Maxillary dental casts were obtained for each child in four periods–in the first 14 days of life, in the third month, in the sixth month and in the age of one year. These were followed by the identification, measurement and evaluation of anthropometric parameters. Results. Significant differences were occurred after the reconstruction of the lips in linear and angle measurements between infants in the A and B groups. Conclusion. The early surgical reconstruction of the lips in the first 14 days of life has a positive effect on the growth and development of the anterior segment of the dentoalveolar arch. Early lip reconstruction forms a continuous pressure on the frontal segment, resulting in the earlier remedy of anatomical properties and creates appropriate conditions for the best development of this area.",Silvia Valentová-Strenáčiková and Radovan Malina,10,15054330459555658656,PeerJ,,e1620,PeerJ Inc.,Effects of early and late cheiloplasty on anterior part of maxillary dental arch development in infants with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate,https://peerj.com/articles/1620/?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_campaign=PeerJ_TrendMD_1&utm_medium=TrendMD,4,2016,/scholar?cites=15054330459555658656,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:dhpJJ7xvgBgC

This study examines the impact of including single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles in risk prediction for white and African American women undergoing screening mammogram.

The effect arises in instances where the metal is very strongly taken up by anion exchangers and anomalous extraction is always greater from lithium halide solution than from the corresponding aqueous halogen hydracid.The dinonyl naphthalene sulphonates occur in the organic layers in micellar form and the composition of such aggregates containing invaded supporting electrolyte and water has been ascertained.Spectrophotometric and stoichiometric measurements on …",DFC Morris and MW Jones,10,6881043187890855738,Electrochimica Acta,12,1233-1257,Pergamon,Extraction of anions by a liquid cation-exchanger,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0013468669870209,14,1969,/scholar?cites=6881043187890855738,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:3wLP7v6BnpwC

18075,"Evaluating new, promising organic molecules to make next-generation organic optoelectronic devices necessitates the evaluation of charge carrier transport performance through the semi-conducting medium. In this work, we utilize quantum chemical calculations (QCC) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations to predict the zero-field hole mobilities of∼ 100 morphologies of the benchmark polymer poly (3-hexylthiophene), with varying simulation volume, structural order, and chain-length polydispersity. Morphologies with monodisperse chains were generated previously using an optimized molecular dynamics force-field and represent a spectrum of nanostructured order. We discover that a combined consideration of backbone clustering and system-wide disorder arising from side-chain conformations are correlated with hole mobility. Furthermore, we show that strongly interconnected thiophene backbones are required for efficient charge transport. This definitively shows the role “tie-chains” play in enabling mobile charges in P3HT. By marrying QCC and KMC over multiple length-and time-scales, we demonstrate that it is now possible to routinely probe the relationship between molecular nanostructure and device performance.
