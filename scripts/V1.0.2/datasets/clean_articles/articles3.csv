They completed 80 rounds (240 trials) of a strategic sequential investment task that required accepting interim losses in order to access a lucrative state and maximize long-term gains. while being scanned.

414,7180,Brain fMRI processing and classification based on combination of PCA and SVM,2009.0,Song-yun Xie and Rong Guo and Ning-fei Li and Ge Wang and Hai-tao Zhao,,,,3384-3389,IEEE,fMRI is one of the fundamental tools for functional human brain research. However. fMRI data are often in a high dimensional feature space and suffer greatly from large and complex dataset. To relieve the curse of dimensionality in fMRI image. PCA combines with SVM to form a feature-based classification method in this work. PCA is employed to find a more compact and reasonable representation of the data by extracting features from each fMRI image. Then a linear kernel SVM classifier is trained on the selected features to detect different brain states. The advantage of incorporating PCA with SVM is twofold: Firstly. the computational burden on SVM classifier is reduced significantly. Secondly. a less complex classifier is well established. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields good performance.

Learning about which stimulus event occurs in the environment and the reward associated with them allows humans to seek out the most valuable stimulus and move through the environment in a goal-directed manner. Stimulus–response associations are characteristic of instrumental learning. whereas response–outcome associations are the hallmark of goal-directed learning. Here we provide behavioral. computational. and neuroimaging results from a novel task in which stimulus–response and response–outcome associations are learned simultaneously but dominate behavior at different stages of the experiment. We found that prediction error representations in the ventral striatum depend on which type of learning dominates.

This has highlighted the need for an efficient frequency-reuse technique that can meet the ever-increasing demand on the available frequency resources. In-band full-duplex (FD) wireless technology that enables the transceiver nodes to transmit and receive simultaneously over the same frequency band. has gained tremendous attention as a promising technology to double the spectral efficiency of the traditional half-duplex (HD) systems. However. this technology faces a formidable challenge. that is the large power difference between the self-interference (SI) signal and the signal of interest from a remote transceiver node. In this thesis. we focus on the architecture of the FD transceivers and investigate their ability to approximately double the throughput and the spectral efficiency of the conventional HD systems. Moreover. this thesis is concerned with the design of efficient self-interference cancellation schemes that can be combined with the architecture of the FD transceiver nodes in order to effectively suppress the SI signal and enable the FD mode. In particular. an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based amplify-and-forward (AF) FD physical-layer network coding (PLNC) system is proposed.

This paper presents characterization results of the self-interference (SI) channel from experimental data obtained by sea trials in the North Sea.

Initial results indicate that the delay spread of the local reverberation can extend up to 1.5 s before it reaches the noise floor level. This in turn has significant implications on the required hardware complexity of the SI mitigation methods based on adaptive filter echo cancellation. which will require tens of thousands of filter taps to deal with this delay spread range and prolonged training periods.

However. its intermittent. unstable and stochastic nature hampers its representation among other renewable energy sources. This work addresses the forecasting of wind speed. a primary input needed for wind energy generation. using data obtained from the South African Wind Atlas Project. Forecasting is carried out on a two days ahead time horizon. We investigate the predictive performance of artificial neural networks (ANN) trained with Bayesian regularisation. decision trees based stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and generalised additive models (GAMs). The results of the comparative analysis suggest that ANN displays superior predictive performance based on root mean square error (RMSE). In contrast. SGB shows outperformance in terms of mean average error (MAE) and the related mean average percentage error (MAPE). A further comparison of two forecast combination methods involving the linear and additive quantile regression averaging show the latter forecast combination method as yielding lower prediction accuracy. The additive quantile regression averaging based prediction intervals also show outperformance in terms of validity. reliability. quality and accuracy. Interval combination methods show the median method as better than its pure average counterpart.

Although the mechanisms of aging are not yet fully understood. inflammation. oxidative damage. mitochondrial dysfunction. functional alterations in specific neuronal circuits and a restricted degree of apoptosis are involved. Physical exercise improves the efficiency of the capillary system and increases the oxygen supply to the brain. thus enhancing metabolic activity and oxygen intake in neurons. and increases neurotrophin levels and resistance to stress. Regular exercise and an active lifestyle during adulthood have been associated with reduced risk and protective effects for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

The present experiments show that postnatal handling of Sprague-Dawley rats (administered from postnatal days 1 to 22) and/or living in an enriched environment (EE; from weaning until the age of 100 days) clearly improved the ability to learn a two-way active avoidance task in adulthood. In addition the results demonstrated that postnatal inconsistent stimulation (from postnatal days 1 to 22) impaired avoidance acquisition in the same task.

The present study was aimed at characterizing a range of biochemical markers of GABA- and dopamine-mediated neurotransmission in the CNS of Roman high-avoidance (RHA/Verh) and Roman low-avoidance (RLA/Verh) rats. two psychogenetically selected lines that differ in their level of emotionality. The stimulatory effect of GABA on 36Cl− uptake was less pronounced in the cerebral cortex of RLA/Verh rats as compared to RHA/Verh rats. whereas no line-related changes were detected in [3H]GABA and [3H]flunitrazepam binding.

With the purpose of identifying potential epigenetic markers involved in aging and neurodegeneration. here we analyzed the expression of 84 mature miRNAs. the expression of histone-acetylation regulatory genes and the global histone acetylation in the hippocampus of 8-month-old SAMP8 mice. using SAMR1 mice as control. We also examined the modulation of these parameters by eight weeks of voluntary exercise. Twenty-one miRNAs were differentially expressed between sedentary SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice and seven miRNAs were responsive to exercise in both strains. SAMP8 mice showed alterations in genes involved in protein acetylation homeostasis such as Sirt1 and Hdac6 and modulation of Hdac3 and Hdac5 gene expression by exercise. Global histone H3 acetylation levels were reduced in SAMP8 compared with SAMR1 mice and reached control levels in response to exercise.

Both drugs were also anxiolytic in the shuttlebox. since 1.75 mg kg−1 alprazolam and 2–3 g kg−1 ethanol improved acquisition of the task.
