They completed 80 rounds (240 trials) of a strategic sequential investment task that required accepting interim losses in order to access a lucrative state and maximize long-term gains. while being scanned.

264,7180,Brain fMRI processing and classification based on combination of PCA and SVM,2009.0,Song-yun Xie and Rong Guo and Ning-fei Li and Ge Wang and Hai-tao Zhao,,,,3384-3389,IEEE,fMRI is one of the fundamental tools for functional human brain research. However. fMRI data are often in a high dimensional feature space and suffer greatly from large and complex dataset. To relieve the curse of dimensionality in fMRI image. PCA combines with SVM to form a feature-based classification method in this work. PCA is employed to find a more compact and reasonable representation of the data by extracting features from each fMRI image. Then a linear kernel SVM classifier is trained on the selected features to detect different brain states. The advantage of incorporating PCA with SVM is twofold: Firstly. the computational burden on SVM classifier is reduced significantly. Secondly. a less complex classifier is well established. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields good performance.

Learning about which stimulus event occurs in the environment and the reward associated with them allows humans to seek out the most valuable stimulus and move through the environment in a goal-directed manner. Stimulus–response associations are characteristic of instrumental learning. whereas response–outcome associations are the hallmark of goal-directed learning. Here we provide behavioral. computational. and neuroimaging results from a novel task in which stimulus–response and response–outcome associations are learned simultaneously but dominate behavior at different stages of the experiment. We found that prediction error representations in the ventral striatum depend on which type of learning dominates.

This has highlighted the need for an efficient frequency-reuse technique that can meet the ever-increasing demand on the available frequency resources. In-band full-duplex (FD) wireless technology that enables the transceiver nodes to transmit and receive simultaneously over the same frequency band. has gained tremendous attention as a promising technology to double the spectral efficiency of the traditional half-duplex (HD) systems. However. this technology faces a formidable challenge. that is the large power difference between the self-interference (SI) signal and the signal of interest from a remote transceiver node. In this thesis. we focus on the architecture of the FD transceivers and investigate their ability to approximately double the throughput and the spectral efficiency of the conventional HD systems. Moreover. this thesis is concerned with the design of efficient self-interference cancellation schemes that can be combined with the architecture of the FD transceiver nodes in order to effectively suppress the SI signal and enable the FD mode. In particular. an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based amplify-and-forward (AF) FD physical-layer network coding (PLNC) system is proposed.

This paper presents characterization results of the self-interference (SI) channel from experimental data obtained by sea trials in the North Sea. Two scenarios are considered. ie hard and soft sea bottom with water column depths of 50 m. Initial results indicate that the delay spread of the local reverberation can extend up to 1.5 s before it reaches the noise floor level. This in turn has significant implications on the required hardware complexity of the SI mitigation methods based on adaptive filter echo cancellation. which will require tens of thousands of filter taps to deal with this delay spread range and prolonged training periods.

However. its intermittent. unstable and stochastic nature hampers its representation among other renewable energy sources. This work addresses the forecasting of wind speed. a primary input needed for wind energy generation. using data obtained from the South African Wind Atlas Project. Forecasting is carried out on a two days ahead time horizon. We investigate the predictive performance of artificial neural networks (ANN) trained with Bayesian regularisation. decision trees based stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and generalised additive models (GAMs). The results of the comparative analysis suggest that ANN displays superior predictive performance based on root mean square error (RMSE). In contrast. SGB shows outperformance in terms of mean average error (MAE) and the related mean average percentage error (MAPE). A further comparison of two forecast combination methods involving the linear and additive quantile regression averaging show the latter forecast combination method as yielding lower prediction accuracy. The additive quantile regression averaging based prediction intervals also show outperformance in terms of validity. reliability. quality and accuracy.

Although the mechanisms of aging are not yet fully understood. inflammation. oxidative damage. mitochondrial dysfunction. functional alterations in specific neuronal circuits and a restricted degree of apoptosis are involved.

The present experiments show that postnatal handling of Sprague-Dawley rats (administered from postnatal days 1 to 22) and/or living in an enriched environment (EE; from weaning until the age of 100 days) clearly improved the ability to learn a two-way active avoidance task in adulthood.

We also examined the modulation of these parameters by eight weeks of voluntary exercise. Twenty-one miRNAs were differentially expressed between sedentary SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice and seven miRNAs were responsive to exercise in both strains.

Extinction and habituation of responses to drug cues or drug aftereffects are unstable and strongly dependent on context. thus limiting the effectiveness of cue exposure treatments in the prevention of relapse. Several strategies are suggested to improve the stability of extinction and habituation in order to enduringly prevent relapse in addictions.(i) Warning patients about the episodic resurgence of unexpected urges or cravings precipitated by conditioned contexts and exposing them to such contexts.(ii) To obtain a maximum protection against relapse. extinction should ‘recreate’all the original learning contexts (ie all possible drug cues).(iii) The behavioral chains involved in self administering drugs ought to be incorporated into cue exposure treatments (without permitting consummatory responses) in order to decrease their signal value as cues for drugs.,True,rN2tDIgAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,27,http://www.academia.edu/download/49660148/0376-8716_2893_2990085-520161017-23473-106bdo9.pdf,12755805481404060646,/scholar?cites=12755805481404060646,,http://www.academia.edu/download/49660148/0376-8716_2893_2990085-520161017-23473-106bdo9.pdf,0,1,y9ickJoAAAAJ | 4Qa9JG4AAAAJ | rN2tDIgAAAAJ | lTiU_pIAAAAJ | jso0DpoAAAAJ | qivqs9AAAAAJ | 0i3GiHsAAAAJ

It was found that picrotoxin enhanced the anti-immobility effects of imipramine and desipramine whereas open field activity remained unaffected or was even decreased by the same treatments. The results seem consistent with recent reports showing direct interactions between several antidepressant drugs and the GABAA receptor/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride ionophore complex (GABAA/benzodiazepine/Cl complex).

Accordingly. environmental treatments which reduce emotional reactivity. such as handling-habituation or postnatal handling. also increase two-way avoidance acquisition (Escorihuela et al.. 1991; Fernandez-Teruel et al.. 1991a).

383,7299,Differences Between Two Psychogenetically Selected Lines of Rats in a Swimming Pool Matching-To-Place Task: Long-Term Effects of Infantile Stimulation,2001.0,Raúl Aguilar and Rosa M Escorihuela and Luis Gil and Adolf Tobeña and Alberto Fernández-teruel,,,,,,The present study explored the effects of infantile stimulation (ie. neonatal handling or NH) on the performance of 18-month-old Roman high-avoidance (RHA/Verh) and low-avoidance (RLA/Verh) rats in a swimming pool matching-to-place (SPMP) test. This test (also called repeated acquisition and place learning-set paradigm) consists of administering pairs of consecutive trials in the Morris water maze. The difference between each “odd” and the consecutive “even” trial of a trial pair is considered to be a measure of working memory. The same rats were first tested for exploration and novelty-seeking in a hole-board test in the presence of novel objects. which showed that RHA/Verh rats were more explorative than their RLA/Verh counterparts. and that NH treatment augmented exploration in RLA/Verh rats. generally eliminating the genetically-based differences between the lines. RHA/Verh rats performed less efficiently than RLA/Verh rats in the SPMP test. and NH facilitated acquisition in the early stages of training in both rat lines. an effect that was presumably due to an improvement in the acquisition of spatial reference information. Performance during training also indicated that RHA/Verh rats showed less differentiated behavior between odd and even trials. indicating a relative working memory deficit at advanced ages in that rat line.

However. the costs involved in engaging users often requires practitioners to trade off between sample size. time requirements. and monetary costs. Micro-task markets. such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk. offer a potential paradigm for engaging a large number of users for low time and monetary costs. Here we investigate the utility of a micro-task market for collecting user measurements. and discuss design considerations for developing remote micro user evaluation tasks.

It emerged as a simple yet powerful way of disseminating information in the Twitter social network. Even though a lot of information is shared in Twitter. little is known yet about how and why certain information spreads more widely than others. In this paper. we examine a number of features that might affect retweetability of tweets. We gathered content and contextual features from 74M tweets and used this data set to identify factors that are significantly associated with retweet rate. We also built a predictive retweet model. We found that. amongst content features. URLs and hashtags have strong relationships with retweetability. Amongst contextual features. the number of followers and followees as well as the age of the account seem to affect retweetability. while. interestingly. the number of past tweets does not predict retweetability of a user's tweet …,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,1351,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5590452/,4176598563614687069,/scholar?cites=4176598563614687069,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.320&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,1,-nlhtEkAAAAJ | 20Y73oIAAAAJ | None | VuWl-KUAAAAJ

The author extends and proposes a new way to taxonomize information visualization techniques by using the Data State Model (E.H. Chi and J.T. Reidl. 1998). In fact. as the taxonomic analysis in the paper will show. many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused.

Their surfing patterns or actions are guided by their information needs. Researchers need tools to explore the complex interactions between user needs. user actions. and the structures and contents of the Web. In this paper. we describe two computational methods for understanding the relationship between user needs and user actions. First. for a particular pattern of surfing. we seek to infer the associated information need. Second. given an information need. and some pages as starting pints. we attempt to predict the expected surfing patterns. The algorithms use a concept called “information scent”. which is the subjective sense of value and cost of accessing a page based on perceptual cues. We present an empirical evaluation of these two algorithms. and show their effectiveness.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,588,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/365024.365325,8153071340259307985,/scholar?cites=8153071340259307985,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.17.7905&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,1,VuWl-KUAAAAJ | None | pt73OF8AAAAJ | jYHJAagAAAAJ

However. it is an open question whether the success of Wikipedia results from a “wisdom of crowds” type of effect in which a large number of people each make a small number of edits. or whether it is driven by a core group of “elite” users who do the lion’s share of the work. In this study we examined how the influence of “elite” vs.“common” users changed over time in Wikipedia. The results suggest that although Wikipedia was driven by the influence of “elite” users early on. more recently there has been a dramatic shift in workload to the “common” user. We also show the same shift in del. icio. us. a very different type of social collaborative knowledge system.

We performed the first in-depth study of user behavior with regard to the location field in Twitter user profiles.

When users did input their location. they almost never specified it at a scale any more detailed than their city. In order to determine whether or not natural user behaviors have a real effect on the'locatability'of users. we performed a simple machine learning experiment to determine whether we can identify a user's location by only looking at what that user tweets.

In this paper we studied content recommendation on Twitter to better direct user attention. In a modular approach. we explored three separate dimensions in designing such a recommender: content sources. topic interest models for users. and social voting. We implemented 12 recommendation engines in the design space we formulated. and deployed them to a recommender service on the web to gather feedback from real Twitter users. The best performing algorithm improved the percentage of interesting content to 72% from a baseline of 33%. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of our recommender design and how our design can generalize to other information streams.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,534,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753503,3791932286682044739,/scholar?cites=3791932286682044739,,https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2010/zerozero88/zerozero88-chi2010.pdf,0,1,Q5nySbYAAAAJ | SLg5E9cAAAAJ | None | zkhHirIAAAAJ | VuWl-KUAAAAJ
