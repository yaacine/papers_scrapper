1100782,A review of techno-economic data for road transportation fuels,2019,Zaira Navas-Anguita and Diego García-Gusano and Diego Iribarren,112,,,11-26,Pergamon,Worldwide. the road transport sector typically arises as one of the main sources of air pollutants due to its high energy intensity and the use of fossil fuels. Thus. governments and social agents work on the development and prospective planning of decarbonisation strategies oriented towards sustainable transport. In this regard. the increase in the use of alternative fuels is the recurrent approach to energy planning. e.g. through the promotion of electric vehicles. biofuels. natural gas. liquefied petroleum gas. etc. However. there is a lack of comprehensive information on the techno-economic performance of production pathways for alternative fuels. The acquisition of robust techno-economic data is still a challenge for energy planners. modellers. analysts and policy-makers when building their prospective models to support decision-making processes. Hence. this article aims to fill this gap through a deep literature …,True,FMGuYkoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,35,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032119303545,14232781622021030263,/scholar?cites=14232781622021030263,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032119303545,0,0,0

1100786,Prospective life cycle assessment of the increased electricity demand associated with the penetration of electric vehicles in Spain,2018,Zaira Navas-Anguita and Diego García-Gusano and Diego Iribarren,11,Energies,5,1185,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The penetration of electric vehicles (EV) seems to be a forthcoming reality in the transport sector worldwide. involving significant increases in electricity demand. However. many countries such as Spain have not yet set binding policy targets in this regard. When compared to a business-as-usual situation. this work evaluates the life-cycle consequences of the increased electricity demand of the Spanish road transport technology mix until 2050. This is done by combining Life Cycle Assessment and Energy Systems Modelling under three alternative scenarios based on the low. medium. or high penetration rate of EV. In all cases. EV deployment is found to involve a relatively small percentage (< 4%) of the final electricity demand. Wind power and waste-to-energy plants arise as the main technologies responsible for meeting the increased electricity demand associated with EV penetration. When considering a high market penetration (20 million EV by 2050). the highest annual impacts potentially caused by the additional electricity demand are 0.93 Mt CO 2 eq. 0.25 kDALY. and 30.34 PJ in terms of climate change. human health. and resources. respectively. Overall. EV penetration is concluded to slightly affect the national power generation sector. whereas it could dramatically reduce the life-cycle impacts associated with conventional transport.

Norway has no official. public energy projection. We have therefore developed an energy projection towards 2050. with openness to data and detailed discussions of parameters and resulting energy demand. It is not a prediction. but a projection. with assumptions based on discussions among the CenSES partners. The objective is to have a platform for further analyses within CenSES and other interested users. where assumptions can be openly presented. The intention is to develop alternative paths based on future discussions. as a way of improving the knowledge of how to achieve a sustainable future energy system. The analysis gives an understanding of the high uncertainties about future energy demand. Four scenarios are presented. all presenting a possible future. and the total energy use differs with about 65 TWh in 2050. The electricity consumption differs with approximately 45 TWh from the lowest to the highest use in the four scenarios. Main parameters varying in the scenarios are the levels of industry activity and energy efficiency implementation as presented in Table 1. The reference scenario is based on an industry activity at the present level and minor implementation of energy efficiency. thodology is used where the demand of energy services is calculated first. This is input to the energy system model TIMES-Norway that calculates the energy consumption. The calculated use of total energy and different energy carriers highly depend on the assumptions used in the analyses.

Ten climate experiments based on 5 different global models and 6 emission scenarios are used to cover the range of possible future climate scenarios. The climate impact on hydro power resources is essential. while the impact on wind power production is of less importance. The regional effects differs considerable. with a decrease in electricity production in the south and the largest increase in the west. Future energy demand has a major impact on both the fraction of renewable energy in Norway and on the possibilities for electricity export to Europe. Climate changes will decrease the end-use demand due to a reduced heating demand.

There are increasing discussions within the international community about establishing an international target for universal access to modern energy services. Such a target could provide a much needed political prioritisation and build on ongoing national activity. To ensure effectiveness. and to underpin delivery and policy formation. will require analytical work on both definitions and measurement. There is considerable precedent in the use of indicators and indices in the development and energy sectors. Drawing on that literature. we outline several options that could inform future work in this area. Such measurement and reporting tools will need to be simple. politically attractive. and analytically robust–a difficult balancing act.

There is a growing body of analysis on the impacts of wind and solar variability on power system operation. Existing studies tend to use a single or typical year of generation data. which overlooks the substantial year-to-year fluctuation in weather. or to only consider variation in the meteorological inputs. which overlooks the complex response of an interconnected power system. Here. we address these gaps by combining detailed continent-wide modeling of Europe's future power system with 30 years of historical weather data. The most representative single years are 1989 and 2012. but using multiple years reveals a 5-fold increase in Europe's inter-annual variability of CO2 emissions and total generation costs from 2015 to 2030.

It is unclear as to what level of distributed generation is expected. appropriate or optimal in future power systems.

Such research tends to consider optimality from narrow viewpoints focused on particular aspects of the electricity network such as the distribution network within the confines of a vision of future electricity systems where centralised infrastructure remains. There is a gap in the literature in considering the role of distributed generation (DG) within the context of the entire electricity system and the wider energy sector and how it can drive the development of an electricity system to maintain a centralised approach or increase decentralisation.

The problem consists of deciding the best strategy for new aircraft configurations (velocity and altitude changes) such that all conflicts in the airspace. i.e.. the loss of the minimum safety distance that has to be kept between two aircraft. are avoided. A mixed 0-1 linear optimization model based on geometric transformations for collision avoidance between an arbitrary number of aircraft in the airspace is developed. Knowing the initial coordinates. angle direction. and level flight. the new configuration for each aircraft is established by minimizing several objective functions. e.g.. velocity variation and total number of changes (velocity and altitude). and forcing to return to the original flight configuration when no aircraft are in conflict.

Order batching is an NP-hard optimization problem that is very difficult to solve exactly in practice. Thus. most implemented solutions are based on elementary heuristic methods that perform a relatively limited exploration of the solution space.

Part I: Deterministic case,2012,A Agustı and Antonio Alonso-Ayuso and Laureano F Escudero and Celeste Pizarro,219,European Journal of Operational Research,1,156-166,North-Holland,In this paper a deterministic mixed 0–1 model for the air traffic flow management problem is presented. The model allows for flight cancelation and rerouting. if necessary. It considers several types of objective functions to minimize. namely. the number of flights exceeding a given time delay (that can be zero). separable and non-separable ground holding and air delay costs. penalization of alternative routes to the scheduled one for each flight. time unit delay cost to arrive to the nodes (i.e.. air sectors and airports) and penalization for advancing arrival to the nodes over the schedule. The arrival and departure capacity at the airports is obviously considered. as well as the capacity of the different sectors in the airspace. being allowed to vary along the time horizon.

The aim of the problem consists of deciding the best strategy for an arbitrary aircraft configuration such that all conflicts in the airspace are avoided where a conflict is the loss of the minimum safety distance that two aircraft have to keep in their flight plans. The optimization model is based on geometric constructions. It requires knowing the initial flight plan (coordinates. angles and velocities in each period). The objective is the minimization of the acceleration variations when the aircraft are forced to return to the original flight plan once there is no aircraft in conflict.

1100886,Mathematical optimization models for air traffic flow management: A review,2010,Alba Agustín and Antonio Alonso-Ayuso and Laureano F Escudero and Celeste Pizarro,,,,,,Congestion problems are becoming increasingly acute in many European and American airports and air sectors. To protect Air Traffic Control (ATC) from overload a planning activity called Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) tries to anticipate and prevent overload and limit resulting delays. When the traffic expects to exceed the airport arrival and departure capacities or the airsector capacity a delay in the flight arrival (so called-congestion) occurs. The casuistry to be considered in this field is very extensive. In general. most references to be found in the literature written some years ago refer to the simplest models. those which do not take into account airsector. This is so because this work was first studied in USA. where  only the problems of congestion in airports basically occur. In the paper we present a state-of-the-art survey on the main optimization models encountered in the literature. They are classified as follows: (1) Single-Airport Ground-Holding Problem (SAGHP). The simplest of the methodologies of planning modelling studied proposes solutions to the problem of deciding the optimal planning for an arrival airport. (2) Multi-Airport Ground-Holding Problem (MAGHP). In this methodology the field of work is extended and the inter-relationship which exists between different airports is included. (3) Air Traffic Flow Management Problem  (ATFMP).  This methodology attempts to solve real situations that are much more complex than those which can be dealt with using the previous methodologies. since the air sector capacity is also considered.

Existing studies have failed to reach a consensus on whether or not regional house prices exhibit long-run convergence with each other. The application is proposed of a new test involving unit root testing of the first principal component based on regional—national house price differentials. Using mix-adjusted quarterly data for 1973—2006. it is found that the first principal component is stationary. This suggests that all UK regional house prices are driven by a single common stochastic trend.

The thermochemical state of the fluid is characterized by two composition variables: mixture fraction ξ(x. t) and reaction progress variable Y(x. t). A linear gradient in the mean mixture fraction field is imposed in the x2 direction. so that. in a forced stationary velocity field. the mixture fraction field attains statistical stationarity. The reaction progress variable Y(x. t) is statistically homogeneous in x1 and x3. and is statistically periodic in x2. The flow is called periodic reaction zones.

One objective is to develop a better understanding of how single-point statistical information contained in descriptions such as the droplet distribution function (ddf). relates to the probability density functions (pdfs) associated with the droplets themselves. Single-point statistical information contained in the droplet distribution function (ddf) is shown to be related to a sequence of single surrogate-droplet pdfs. which are in general different from the physical single-droplet pdfs. It is shown that the ddf contains less information than the fundamental single-point statistical representation of the spray. which is also described.

1101428,A comprehensive probability density function formalism for multiphase flows,2009,Madhusudan G Pai and Shankar Subramaniam,628,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,181,,A theoretical foundation for two widely used statistical representations of multiphase flows. namely the Eulerian–Eulerian (EE) and Lagrangian–Eulerian (LE) representations. is established in the framework of the probability density function (pdf) formalism. Consistency relationships between fundamental statistical quantities in the EE and LE representations are rigorously established. It is shown that fundamental quantities in the two statistical representations bear an exact relationship to each other only under conditions of spatial homogeneity. Transport equations for the probability densities in each statistical representation are derived. Exact governing equations for the mean mass. mean momentum and second moment of velocity corresponding to the two statistical representations are derived from these transport equations. In particular. for the EE representation. the pdf formalism is shown to naturally lead to the widely used ensemble-averaged equations for two-phase flows. Galilean-invariant combinations of unclosed terms in the governing equations that need to be modelled are clearly identified. The correspondence between unclosed terms in each statistical representation is established. Hybrid EE–LE computations can benefit from this correspondence. which serves in consistently transferring information from one representation to the other.

One source could be the large variations in spray particle number density resulting in lack of su cient number of spray particles in many cells. which could lead to signi cant statistical error. This suggests that particle number density control in physical space is required in order to provide spatially uniform control of the statistical error. which is necessary for establishing numerical convergence. Another reason for lack of convergence. or slow convergence. could be the order of the scheme used to interpolate mean particle property elds on to the grid. and gas {phase elds on to the particles.

Preliminary synthetic protocols with this capping agent. where the nanoparticle formation reaction and passivation processes were both conducted at ambient temperatures. had resulted in nanoparticles that were highly unstable and that either oxidized rapidly upon exposure to air or were pyrophoric. Use of 1.2-epoxydodecane. on the other hand. had produced stable nanoparticles that were successfully characterized and reported. A modification of the procedure whereby the epoxyhexane passivation process is carried out at 85 °C for 30 min. has afforded surprisingly stable aluminum nanoparticles.

Long-chain epoxides have proven to be effective capping agents for Al NPs as the epoxide ring is highly susceptible to ring-opening polymerization. leading to the formation of putative polyether loops on the nascent Al NP surface. However. these materials are observed to degrade within several hours to days following exposure to ambient air. By inducing polymerization of the additional terminal alkene functionality on the epoxide. we have produced Al NPs that exhibit both a shelf life of ~6 weeks and a high active Al content. Transmission electron microscopy confirms that these spherical nanostructures. ~25 nm in diameter. are embedded in a covalently bound polymer matrix that serves as a prophylactic barrier against water/air (H2O/O2) degradation. and 27Al solid-state NMR is used to …,True,l4msxasAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11051-013-1729-8,13658297396252726846,/scholar?cites=13658297396252726846,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Buckner/publication/257630090_Synthesis_of_aluminum_nanoparticles_capped_with_copolymerizable_epoxides/links/5488a2210cf268d28f08fc9f/Synthesis-of-aluminum-nanoparticles-capped-with-copolymerizable-epoxides.pdf,0,0,0

An especially promising class of boron-containing compounds is the rhenacarboranes that. if able to cross the BBB. could act as delivery vehicles as well as a source of boron. Here. we examined the ability of the 3-NO-3.3-κ2-(2.2′-N2C10H6(Me){(CH2)7131I}-4.4′)-closo-3.1.2-ReC2B9H11 (rhenacarborane) labeled with iodine-131 to be taken up into the bloodstream after subcutaneous administration and to cross the BBB.
