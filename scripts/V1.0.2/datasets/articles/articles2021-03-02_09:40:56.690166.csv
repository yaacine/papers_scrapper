1095125,Adverse events among medical patients after discharge from hospital,2004,Alan J Forster and Heather D Clark and Alex Menard and Natalie Dupuis and Robert Chernish and Natasha Chandok and Asmat Khan and Carl van Walraven,170,Cmaj,3,345-349,CMAJ,Background: Adverse events (AEs) are adverse outcomes caused by medical care. Several studies have indicated that a substantial number of patients experience AEs before or during hospitalization. However. few data describe AEs after hospital discharge. We determined the incidence. severity. preventability and ameliorability of AEs in patients discharged from the general internal medicine service of a Canadian hospital.Methods: At a multisite Canadian teaching hospital. we prospectively studied patients who were consecutively discharged home or to a seniors9 residence from the general internal medicine service during a 14-week interval in 2002. We used telephone interview and chart review to identify outcomes after discharge. Two physicians independently reviewed each outcome to determine if the patient experienced an AE. The severity. preventability and ameliorability of all AEs were classified.Results: During the study period. outcomes were determined for 328 of the 361 eligible patients. who averaged 71 years of age (interquartile range 54–81 years). After discharge. 76 of the 328 patients experienced at least 1 AE (overall incidence 23%. 95% confidence interval [CI] 19%–28%). The AE severity ranged from symptoms only (68% of the AEs) or symptoms associated with a nonpermanent disability (25%) to permanent disability (3%) or death (3%). The most common AEs were adverse drug events (72%). therapeutic errors (16%) and nosocomial infections (11%). Of the 76 patients. 38 had an AE that was either preventable or ameliorable (overall incidence 12%. 95% CI 9%–16%).Interpretation: Approximately one-quarter of …,True,5miatCkAAAAJ:w9ZB08sdvuUC,865,https://www.cmaj.ca/content/170/3/345.short,5472083105768594938,/scholar?cites=5472083105768594938,,https://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/170/3/345.full.pdf,0,0,0

The resultant multilayer films were found to exhibit both antifogging and antireflection properties. The antifogging properties are a direct result of the development of superhydrophilic wetting characteristics (water droplet contact angle <5° within 0.5 s or less). The nearly instantaneous sheetlike wetting promoted by the superhydrophilic multilayer prevents light scattering water droplets from forming on a surface. The low refractive index of the multilayer film (as low as 1.22) resulting from the presence of nanopores was found to impart excellent antireflection properties.

FcRn. on human intestinal epithelial cells,1997,EJ Israel and S Taylor and Z Wu and E Mizoguchi and RS Blumberg and A Bhan and NE Simister,92,Immunology,1,69-74,Blackwell Science Ltd,Maternal IgG is transferred to the suckling mouse and rat through a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I‐related Fc receptor (FcRn) on the brush border of the proximal small intestine. We have previously described a site on the epithelial surface of the human fetal intestine with IgG binding characteristics similar to FcRn. We report here the identification by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of the human orthologue of rat and mouse FcRn in tissue obtained from human fetal and adult intestine. FcRn protein was detected in adult human intestine by western blot. Immunohistochemical studies of sections of human intestine show that the FcRn is localized mostly to the epithelial cells. where it is in the apical region.

Since Weiser first proposed the notion of slicing in 1979. hundreds of papers have been presented in this area. Tens of variants of slicing have been studied. as well as algorithms to compute them. Different notions of slicing have different properties and different applications. These notions vary from Weiser's syntax-preserving static slicing to amorphous slicing which is not syntax-preserving. and the algorithms can be based on dataflow equations. information-flow relations or dependence graphs.Slicing was first-developed to facilitate debugging. but it is then found helpful in many aspects of the software development life cycle. including program debugging. software testing. software measurement. program comprehension. software maintenance. program parallelization and so on.Over the last two decades. several …,True,3wT8v3YAAAAJ:uQyLbZAWguAC,336,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1050849.1050865,8935436081426518318,/scholar?cites=8935436081426518318,,,0,0,0

Progress in photovoltaic cells. in particular. the ability of quantum-well cells to tune the band gap. also suggests high efficiency is possible in solar and thermophotovoltaic applications. A thermodynamic model is used to show quantitatively how the separation of absorption and luminescent peaks under global illumination is related to the spread of quantum-dot sizes.

In the latter case. a decrease in the fluorescence lifetime when the polarity of the solvent is in-creased. resulting mainly from an increase in theradiative rate. has been observed in addition to a red shift of thefluorescence spectrum.

Kinetic studies with 1H NMR microimaging showed that the dispersed water in the silica gel pore system reacts readily with the gas. thus obviating the need for a stirred reactor and excess water. Hydrate phase equilibria for the ternary CO2−N2−water system in silica gel pores were measured. which show that the three-phase hydrate−water-rich liquid−vapor equilibrium curves were shifted to higher pressures at a specific temperature when the concentration of CO2 in the vapor phase decreased. 13C cross-polarization NMR spectral analysis and direct measurement of the CO2 content in the hydrate phase suggested that the mixed hydrate is structure I …,True,KzEZ3vIAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,271,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es049269z,4758824561932950916,/scholar?cites=4758824561932950916,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/38558964.pdf,0,0,0

Amtul and Atta-ur-Rahman,,,,,,Studies on enzyme inhibition remain an important area of pharmaceutical research since these studies have led to the discoveries of drugs useful in a variety of physiological conditions. The enzyme inhibitors can interact with enzymes and block their activity towards natural substrates. Urease inhibitors have recently attracted much attention as potential new anti-ulcer drugs. Ironically. urease was the first enzyme crystallized but its mechanism of action is still largely misunderstood. This chapter therefore reviews comprehensive developments in the field of urease inhibitors. Inhibitors of urease can be broadly classified into two categories: (1) active site directed (substrate-like). (2) mechanism-based directed. We present here the examples of selected inhibitors along with their mechanisms of action to characterize their mode of urease inhibition.

Plenary lecture,1992,Lo Gorton and Gunilla Jönsson-Pettersson and Elisabeth Csöregi and Kristina Johansson and Elena Domínguez and György Marko-Varga,117,Analyst,8,1235-1241,Royal Society of Chemistry,An apparent direct electron transfer between various electrode materials and peroxidases immobilized on the surface of the electrode has been reported in the last few years. An electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide stars at about +600 mV versus a saturated calomel (reference) electrode (SCE) at neutral pH. The efficiency of the electrocatalytic current increases as the applied potential is made more negative and starts to level off at about –200 mV versus SCE.

Significant antioxidant capacity in milk and whey was demonstrated by the ABTS method (TAC(ABTS)). and it apparently increased with increasing pH. TAC (ABTS) was several-fold higher in milk than in whey. which had a slightly higher TAC than a LMW fraction prepared from it. Also the FRAP method could be used to demonstrate TAC in whey. although the low pH necessary for this method led to some protein precipitation.

With ZnO2 as precursors. we introduce a high concentration of oxygen vacancies into ZnO successfully. The obtained ZnO exhibits a yellow color. and the absorption edge shifts to longer wavelength. Raman and XPS spectra reveal that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ZnO decreased when the samples are annealed at higher temperature in air. It is consistent with the theory calculation. The increasing of oxygen vacancies results in a narrowing bandgap and increases the visible light absorption of the ZnO. The narrowing bandgap can be confirmed by the enhancement of the photocurrent response when the ZnO was irradiated with visible light.

Desirable photocatalysts are those that can carry out complete decomposition of organic pollutants at low levels.[1] The most extensively studied photocatalyst. TiO2. has a large band gap (ie. 3.2 eV for anatase and 3.0 eV for rutile) and hence absorbs only the UV light. which accounts for only 4% of the total sunlight. to generate charge carriers for promoting the surface redox reactions. Due to this inherent property of TiO2. its practical applications are rather limited. To effectively utilize the visible light that constitutes 43% of the total sunlight. it is important to find a photocatalyst that is active and efficient under visible light. Much effort has been devoted to developing “second-generation” TiO2[2] and other narrow band gap semiconductors [3] that can absorb visible light. Photocatalysts active under visible light are not necessarily limited to semiconductors with a narrow band gap. but can include semiconductors with a large band gap that can work synergetically with nanoparticles of a noble metal. Nanoparticles of noble metals exhibit unique optical properties that arise from the collective oscillation of the conduction electrons upon interaction with electromagnetic radiation. namely. the localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR).[4. 5] For an ensemble of isolated nanoparticles. the shape. the amplitude. and the frequency of the maximum absorbance of the surface plasmon absorption band depend on the effective dielectric constant of the surrounding medium as well as their morphology and size distribution.[6–9 …,True,8m_HiJ0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,569,https://www.academia.edu/download/42104841/Highly_Efficient_Visible-Light_Plasmonic20160204-14896-1e0g29j.pdf,2401928972935198549,/scholar?cites=2401928972935198549,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42104841/Highly_Efficient_Visible-Light_Plasmonic20160204-14896-1e0g29j.pdf,0,0,0

In these composites. the plasmonic nanoparticles (PNPs) efficiently absorb solar light through localized surface plasmon resonance and convert it into energetic electrons and holes in the nearby semiconductor. This energy transfer from PNPs to semiconductors plays a decisive role in the overall photocatalytic performance. Thus. the underlying physical mechanism is of great scientific and technological importance and is one of the hottest topics in the area of plasmonic photocatalysts.

However. some claimed metal‐free catalysts are prepared using metal‐containing precursors. It is highly contested that metal residues in nitrogen‐doped carbon (NC) catalysts play a crucial role in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Netherlands: Bentham Science Publishers. c1994-,Cyclic peptides that are potent regulators of biological processes are rapidly emerging as important mechanistic probes and drug leads. Nature clearly uses macrocycles to. constrain peptides into conformations that can selectively bind proteins or small molecules. Therapeutic effects of such macrocycles. often containing additional conformational constraints that finetune structure (eg D-amino acids. N-methyl substituents. aromatic rings. to name a few). have so far been mainly discovered by accident. However it is now becoming possible to rationally design synthetic macrocycles to selectively recognize and inhibit a specific protein. A receptor-binding structure is more easily adopted by macrocyclic peptidomimetics than more flexible acyclic peptides because the former have less conformational entropy. Macrocycles are often stable to hydrolysis by peptidases that degrade acyclic peptides and hydrophobic side chains can protect peptide bonds in macrocycles from hydrolysis. as well as enhance lipophilicity. cell permeability and bioavailability. Synthetic efforts to obtain bioactive conformations of short peptides have so far been substrate-based. guided by molecular modelling predictions and structure-activity data for modified amino acid sequences of substrates.

Unsurprisingly. therefore. immunoregulatory and metabolic mechanisms interact in human conditions such as obesity. Both infiltrating immunoinflammatory cells and adipocytes play critical roles in the modulation of metabolic homeostasis. so it is important to understand factors that regulate both adipocyte and immune cell function.

1095491,Solution NMR of paramagnetic molecules: applications to metallobiomolecules and models,2001,Ivano Bertini and Claudio Luchinat and Giacomo Parigi,,,,,Elsevier,NMR is a growing technique which represents a generalized. spread. common tool for spectroscopy and for structural and dynamic investigation. Part of the field of competence of NMR is represented by molecules with unpaired electrons. which are called paramagnetic. The presence of unpaired electrons is at the same time a drawback (negative effect) and a precious source of information about structure and dynamics. New phenomena and effects are described which are due to the high magnetic fields and advances in the methodology. Solution NMR of Paramagnetic Molecules is unique in dealing with these matters. The scope is that of presenting a complete description. which is both rigorous and pictorial. of theory and experiments of NMR of paramagnetic molecules in solution. Pertinent examples are described. From the time dependent behaviour of electrons in the various metal ions including polimetallic systems to the hyperfine-based information. and from NMR experiments to constraints for solution structure determination. The book's major theme is how to perform high resolution NMR experiments and how to obtain structural and dynamic information on paramagnetic metal ion containing systems.,True,iezfnu4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,610,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VqF1uy36WpQC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:8lP4mwSl60EJ:scholar.google.com&ots=pvubzHr3s-&sig=XhKVLebcrtQrCEeeWH7bOxz8yfo,4750071671207515122,/scholar?cites=4750071671207515122,,,0,0,0

Comprehensive solid-state NMR (SSNMR) structural studies on uniformly isotope-labeled Aβ assemblies have been hampered for a long time by sample heterogeneity and low spectral resolution. In this work. SSNMR studies on well-ordered fibril samples of Aβ40 with an additional N-terminal methionine provide high-resolution spectra which lead to an accurate structural model. The fibrils studied here carry distinct structural features compared to previous reports. The inter-β-strand contacts within the U-shaped β-strand-turn-β-strand motif are shifted. the N-terminal region adopts a β-conformation. and new inter-monomer contacts occur at the protofilament interface.

Each set of observables provides independent information on the conformations experienced by the molecule. It is found that not all sterically allowed conformations are equally populated. Taking the N-terminal domain as the reference. the C-terminal domain preferentially resides in a region of space inscribed in a wide elliptical cone.

This information can be extracted from a biofluids Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum. However. due to its complexity. NMR spectral profiling has remained manual. resulting in slow. expensive and error-prone procedures that have hindered clinical and industrial adoption of metabolomics via NMR. This paper presents a system. BAYESIL. which can quickly. accurately. and autonomously produce a person’s metabolic profile. Given a 1D 1H NMR spectrum of a complex biofluid (specifically serum or cerebrospinal fluid). BAYESIL can automatically determine the metabolic profile. This requires first performing several spectral processing steps. then matching the resulting spectrum against a reference compound library. which contains the “signatures” of each relevant metabolite. BAYESIL views spectral matching as an inference problem within a probabilistic graphical model that rapidly approximates the most probable metabolic profile. Our extensive studies on a diverse set of complex mixtures including real biological samples (serum and CSF). defined mixtures and realistic computer generated spectra; involving > 50 compounds. show that BAYESIL can autonomously find the concentration of NMR-detectable metabolites accurately (~ 90% correct identification and ~ 10% quantification error). in less than 5 minutes on a single CPU.

AES and Blowfish: Symmetric key cryptography algorithms simulation based performance analysis,2011,Jawahar Thakur and Nagesh Kumar,1,International journal of emerging technology and advanced engineering,2,6-12,,Security is the most challenging aspects in the internet and network applications. Internet and networks applications are growing very fast. so the importance and the value of the exchanged data over the internet or other media types are increasing. Hence the search for the best solution to offer the necessary protection against the data intruders’ attacks along with providing these services in time is one of the most interesting subjects in the security related communities. Cryptography is the one of the main categories of computer security that converts information from its normal form into an unreadable form. The two main characteristics that identify and differentiate one encryption algorithm from another are its ability to secure the protected data against attacks and its speed and efficiency in doing so.This paper provides a fair comparison between three most common symmetric key cryptography algorithms: DES. AES. and Blowfish. Since main concern here is the performance of algorithms under different settings. the presented comparison takes into consideration the behavior and the performance of the algorithm when different data loads are used. The comparison is made on the basis of these parameters: speed. block size. and key size.

Ltd,Although human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression is implicated in tumor progression for a variety of cancer types. how it dysregulates signaling networks governing cell behavioral functions is poorly understood. To address this problem. we use quantitative mass spectrometry to analyze dynamic effects of HER2 overexpression on phosphotyrosine signaling in human mammary epithelial cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin (HRG). Data generated from this analysis reveal that EGF stimulation of HER2‐overexpressing cells activates multiple signaling pathways to stimulate migration. whereas HRG stimulation of these cells results in amplification of a specific subset of the migration signaling network.

The key issue in the waste management is that the garbage bin at public places gets overflowed well in advance before the commencement of the next cleaning process. It in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odor & ugliness to that place which may be the root cause for spread of various diseases. To avoid all such hazardous scenario and maintain public cleanliness and health this work is mounted on a smart garbage system. The main theme of the work is to develop a smart intelligent garbage alert system for a proper garbage management.

E.E.-α-farnesene and E-β-farnesene. were found to be elevated in dominant male urine when compared to subordinate or control males. These two urinary compounds were absent in the bladder urine of males; however. they were the most prominent constituents of the preputial gland's aliquots. The results of a two-choice preference test. conducted on ICR/Alb subordinate males. gave a strong indication that these two terpenic constituents introduced into the previously attractive stimulus significantly discouraged prolonged investigations by male mice.

When the available figures are standardized with respect to both smoking habits and age. the urban factor is found to be re-sponsible for approximately 25% of lung cancer deaths in cities. Although air pollution by chemicalcarcinogens may not be entirely responsible for this urban factor (2). it is to a great degree a contributory cause. Consequently. the interest in identification and routine measurements of a wide range of such carcinogens has steadily been increasing. Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are the largest known group of chemical carcinogens that are created during various combustion processes and found in airborne partic-ulates.

However. they differ noticeably in stability. hampering further analysis of their interaction. Objectives and methods: Guided by analysis of the LRR structure. we report a well‐folded Ibβ/IX chimera and its usage in dissecting GPIX function. Results: In this chimera. three non‐contiguous sequences that may constitute the putative convex surface of the GPIbβ ectodomain are replaced by their GPIX counterparts. Like GPIbβ but unlike GPIX ectodomain. it can secrete from transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and fold into a stable conformation.

For the copolymerization of nBuA with MMA. good agreement of the ratios is observed between conventional and controlled radical copolymerization. indicating that chemoselectivities in both processes are similar. The relative reactivity of the MM (1/rnBuA) in conventional copolymerization is significantly lower than that of MMA. It depends on the concentration of the comonomers but is not significantly influenced by the length of the MM. At high concentrations the relative reactivity decreases due to diffusion control of the MM addition. In ATRP the relative reactivity of the MM is much nearer to the value of MMA.

From Tafel plots of anodic and cathodic hydrogen peroxide reactions at various metal (Au. Pt. Rh. Ni.

The electrochemical decomposition pathway was confirmed by measuring the steady-state short-circuit current between platinum and gold interdigitated microelectrodes (IMEs) in the presence of H2O2. The resulting ion flux from platinum to gold implies an electric field in the surrounding solution that can be estimated from Ohm's Law. This catalytically generated electric field could in principle bring about electrokinetic effects that scale with the Helmholtz−Smoluchowski equation.
