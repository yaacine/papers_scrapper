1132154,Self-organized porous titanium oxide prepared in H 2 SO 4/HF electrolytes,2003,R Beranek and H Hildebrand and P Schmuki,6,Electrochemical and Solid State Letters,3,B12,IOP Publishing,The formation of porous on titanium was investigated in electrolytes containing low concentrations of HF (0.05-0.4 wt%). Under optimized electrolyte conditions and extended polarization. highly ordered porous is obtained that consists of pore arrays with single pore diameter of 140 nm and a pore spacing of 150 nm. During the formation process. significant current oscillations are observed with an amplitude which depends strongly on the HF content of the electrolyte. Electrochemical. scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations show that the porous layer forms under a competition of formation and oxide dissolution up to a limiting thickness of and that the time scale for complete self-ordering for the investigated systems is in the order of several hours.© 2003 The Electrochemical Society.

The layers consist of arrays of individual tubes with a length of ∼2μm. a diameter of ∼100nm. and a wall thickness of ∼10nm. These layers can be annealed to an anatase structure which strongly increases the photocurrent efficiency. Moreover. the nanotube layers can—under certain conditions—exhibit a drastically enhanced photocurrent compared to compact anatase layers. These strong changes in the photoresponse are attributed to the characteristics of the space charge layer within the tube wall.,True,FHAiRnEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,364,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2140085,14201958268731186769,/scholar?cites=14201958268731186769,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Radim_Beranek/publication/234980512_Enhancement_and_Limits_of_the_Photoelectrochemical_Response_From_Anodic_TiO2_Nanotubes/links/00b7d527964c52d269000000.pdf,0,0,0
1132156,Tuning the optical and photoelectrochemical properties of surface-modified TiO 2,2008,Radim Beranek and Horst Kisch,7,,1,40-48,Royal Society of Chemistry,Surface-modification of TiO2 is found to be a powerful tool for manipulating the fundamental optical and photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2. High surface area nanocrystalline TiO2 was modified by urea pyrolysis products at different temperatures between 300 °C and 500 °C. Modification occurs through incorporation of nitrogen species containing carbon into the surface structure of titania. The N1s XPS binding energies are 399–400 eV and decrease with increasing modification temperature whereby the Ti2p3/2 peak is also shifted to lower binding energies by about 0.5 eV. With increasing modification temperature the optical bandgap of surface-modified TiO2 continuously decreases down to ∼2.1 eV and the quasi-Fermi level of electrons at pH 7 is gradually shifted from –0.6 V to –0.3 V vs.NHE. The surface-modified materials show enhanced sub-bandgap absorption (Urbach tail) and exhibit photocurrents …,True,FHAiRnEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,252,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2008/pp/b711658f,16517808630082698415,/scholar?cites=16517808630082698415,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Radim_Beranek/publication/5681341_Tuning_the_optical_and_photoelectrochemical_properties_of_surface-modified_TiO2/links/0046352796fdecdace000000/Tuning-the-optical-and-photoelectrochemical-properties-of-surface-modified-TiO2.pdf,0,0,0
1132157,(Photo) electrochemical methods for the determination of the band edge positions of TiO2-based nanomaterials,2011,Radim Beranek,2011,Advances in Physical Chemistry,,,Hindawi,TiO2-based nanomaterials play currently a major role in the development of novel photochemical systems and devices. One of the key parameters determining the photoactivity of TiO2-based materials is the position of the band edges. Although its knowledge is an important prerequisite for understanding and optimizing the performance of photochemical systems. it has been often rather neglected in recent research. particularly in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis. This paper provides a concise account of main methods for the determination of the position of the band edges. particularly those suitable for measurements on nanostructured materials. In the first part. a survey of key photophysical and photochemical concepts necessary for understanding the energetics at the semiconductor/solution interface is provided. This is followed by a detailed discussion of several electrochemical. photoelectrochemical. and spectroelectrochemical methods that can be applied for the determination of band edge positions in compact and nanocrystalline thin films. as well as in nanocrystalline powders.,True,FHAiRnEAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,245,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2011/786759.pdf,1687854217423998522,/scholar?cites=1687854217423998522,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2011/786759.pdf,0,0,0
1132158,Surface-modified anodic TiO2 films for visible light photocurrent response,2007,Radim Beranek and Horst Kisch,9,Electrochemistry communications,4,761-766,Elsevier,N-doped titania thin films were prepared by anodic oxidation of titanium sheets and subsequent heat treatment in the presence of urea pyrolysis products at 400 °C. The resulting films are modified predominantly at the surface. They exhibited a significant photocurrent response upon visible light irradiation inducing an incident photon-to-current efficiency of 1.5% at 400 nm. The flatband potential was anodically shifted by 0.2 V as compared to the unmodified film. Photocurrent transients revealed that nitrogen-centered intra-bandgap states. responsible for visible light response. induce also enhanced recombination as indicated by a cathodic “overshoot” after turning off the light. This recombination can be inhibited by the presence of iodide.,True,FHAiRnEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,123,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388248106005236,10196889278350714956,/scholar?cites=10196889278350714956,,,0,0,0

In the presence of air and absence of a hole scavenger a weak SPV signal was observable already in the visible region but completely vanished in the UV above 3.40 eV suggesting complete charge recombination. Whereas in the presence of formic acid only upon UV excitation the signal was increased. this occurred already upon Vis light irradiation when iodide was the hole scavenger.

In contrast to unmodified TiO2 nanotubes. the modified photoelectrodes exhibit photocurrents under visible light irradiation down to 750 nm. Photocurrent transients indicate enhanced recombination unless a suitable hole-scavenger. like iodide. is present since the photogenerated holes do not oxidize water efficiently. In the visible light the photoconversion efficiency increases significantly with nanotube length.

Since both TiO2 and polyheptazine are extremely chemically stable. these materials are highly promising candidates for fabrication of photoanodes for water photooxidation. The properties of the hybrids were experimentally determined by a careful analysis of optical absorption spectra. luminescence properties and photoelectrochemical measurements. and corroborated by quantum chemical calculations. We provide for the first time clear experimental evidence for the formation of an interfacial charge-transfer complex between polyheptazine (donor) and TiO2 (acceptor). which is responsible for a significant red shift of absorption and photocurrent response of the hybrid as compared to both of the single components.

In order to study the thickness dependence of photoelectrochemical (PEC) behavior of WO3. the thickness-gradient films were fabricated and patterned using a micro-machined Si-shadow mask during the deposition process. The variation of the sputter pressure leads to the evolution of different microstructures of the thin films. The films fabricated at 2 mTorr sputter pressure are dense and show diminished PEC properties. while the films fabricated at 20 mTorr and 30 mTorr are less dense and exhibit enhanced water photooxidation efficiency. The enhanced photooxidation is attributed to the coexistence of porous microstructure and space charge region enabling improved charge carrier transfer to the electrolyte and back contact.

Four hybrid electrodes (BiVO4/Co3O4. BiVO4/CuO. TiO2/Co3O4.

The former three electrodes exhibited wavelength-controlled switching of photocurrent direction. whereas the latter one showed exclusively cathodic photocurrents. The prerequisite for the switching effect is that the potentials of the valence and conduction band edges of an n-type component are more positive than those of a p-type one.

The Co‐Pi cocatalyst couples effectively to photoholes generated in the surface polyheptazine layer of the TiO2–PH photoanode. as evidenced by complete photooxidation of water to oxygen under visible‐light (λ>420 nm) irradiation at moderate bias potentials. In addition. the presence of the cocatalyst also reduces significantly the recombination of photogenerated charges. particularly at low bias potentials. which is ascribed to better photooxidation kinetics resulting in lower accumulation of holes.

A wide range of both ester- and amide-containing pseudo-telechelic diols were thus obtained by varying the spacer length between either ester or amide functions. These compounds were thoroughly characterized by means of NMR analysis and by titration. Their viscosity as well as their thermal behavior was assessed. Polyurethanes (PUs) were then obtained by reaction with a commercially available diisocyanate (MDI prepolymer).

Different synthetic approaches are discussed to introduce the phosphonate moieties into vinyl monomers. focusing especially on recent advances. Allyl-type. vinyl-type. styrenic-type and (meth)acrylic-type monomers bearing phosphonate groups (i.e. either mono or bisphosphonate) are considered with a special care about their reactivity in free radical (co)polymerization. It is shown that depending on the position of the phosphonate moieties the reactivity of the vinyl monomers is thus modified. For instance. free radical polymerization of vinyl phosphonate monomers is mainly dominated by transfer reactions. whereas the propagation rate of para-vinylbenzyl phosphonate monomers is enhanced by the phosphonate group.

A Wiley Company,A new phosphonated methacrylate. namely dimethyl(methacryloyloxy)methyl phosphonate (MAPC1). has been synthesized using paraformaldehyde and potassium carbonate according to the Pudovik reaction. The quantitative synthesis of MAPC1 was followed by selective hydrolysis of the ester group with sodium bromide to replace NaI (imparting non‐negligible ecological impact). Pure MAPC1(OH) was obtained in high yield and efficiently copolymerized with MMA. The r1 for MAPC1(OH)) and r2 (for MMA) values are 0.99 and 1.02. respectively. which indicates that the monophosphonic groups are statistically linked to the methacrylate backbone.

Field effect transistors have been fabricated and characterized in the “as fabricated” state and after surface passivation with 1-octadecanethiol (ODT). Electrical characterization of the transistors shows that the subthreshold slope and electron mobility in devices passivated with ODT are superior to the respective values in unpassivated devices. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study of ODT passivated undoped InAs nanowires indicates that sulfur from ODT is bonded to In on the InAs nanowires. Simulations using a two-dimensional device simulator (MEDICI) show that the improvements in device performance after ODT passivation can be quantified in terms of a decrease of interface trap electron donor states. shifts in fixed …,True,rW3A5vgAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,119,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl071888t,10812097283123814763,/scholar?cites=10812097283123814763,,,0,0,0

The variational quantum eigensolver. a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware. has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that. instead of fixing an ansatz upfront. grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters. leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations. including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule. which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach. in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy.

In this method. we use a multilevel partitioning approach coupled with electronic structure studies at multiple levels of theory to provide a hierarchical strategy for systematically improving the computed results. In particular. we use a generalized hybrid energy expression. similar in spirit to that in the popular ONIOM methodology. that can be combined easily with any fragmentation procedure. In the current work. we explore a MIM scheme which first partitions a molecule into nonoverlapping fragments and then recombines the interacting fragments to form overlapping subsystems.

In this paper. we demonstrate that. by using a set of fragments which overlap with each other. a many-body expansion converges much faster than using nonoverlapping fragments. A new hierarchical fragmentation scheme is therefore proposed which generalizes the many-body expansion expressions and describes a simple procedure for generating the set of overlapping monomers. This method is referred to as the many-overlapping-body (MOB) expansion and is evaluated with two example systems: four dendritic isomers of C29H60 and 10 conformational isomers of a polypeptide molecule.

In the RAS-nSF configuration interaction wave function. an arbitrary number of spin-flips are performed within an orbital active space (often simply the singly occupied orbitals). with state-specific orbital relaxation being described by single excitations into and out of the active space (termed hole and particle states. respectively). As the number of hole and particle states dominates the cost of the calculation. we present an attractive simplification in which the orbital relaxation effects (via hole and particle states) are treated perturbatively rather than variationally.

Here. we address all these key outstanding issues of the algorithm. We present a hardware-efficient variant of ADAPT-VQE that drastically reduces circuit depths using an operator pool that is guaranteed to contain the operators necessary to construct exact ansätze. Moreover. we show that the minimal pool size that achieves this scales linearly with the number of qubits. Through numerical simulations on . LiH and . we show that our algorithm ("" qubit-ADAPT"") reduces the circuit depth by an order of magnitude while maintaining the same accuracy as the original ADAPT-VQE. A central result of our approach is that the additional measurement overhead of qubit-ADAPT compared to fixed-ansatz variational algorithms scales only linearly …",True,X4it56UAAAAJ:Gpwnp1kGG20C,23,https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10205,324128082396246711,/scholar?cites=324128082396246711,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10205,0,0,0

We have found that while Mo3O6− and Mo3S6− assume very similar ring-type isomers. Mo3O9− and Mo3S9− clusters are very different with Mo3O9− having a ring-type structure and Mo3S9− having a more open. linear-type geometry. The more rigid ∠(Mo−S−Mo) bond angle is the primary geometric property responsible for producing such different lowest energy isomers. By computing molecular complexation energies. it is observed that water is found to adsorb more strongly to Mo3O6− than to Mo3S6−. due to a stronger oxide−water hydrogen bond. although dispersion effects reduce this difference when molybdenum centers contribute to the binding.

Fourteen different surfactants were tested for spontaneous imbibition into oil-wet chalk cores.

In part 1. counter-current SI was studied by submerging cubic. cylindrical. and irregular rock samples totally in the aqueous phase. whereas co-current SI was investigated in part 2 by exposing different portions of a cubic rock sample to an oil-phase. The scaling law of Ma et al.1 was used to correlate counter-current SI data with all parameters than the characteristic length. LC. held essentially constant.

Scaling groups is one important way to estimate oil recovery from such types of reservoirs. This paper describes a new scaling group for the estimation of oil recovery from single matrix blocks which also accounts for gravity effects. The group is derived on the basis of the analytical solution of the Washburn equation accounting for gravity effects using the Lambert’s W function. The new scaling law was tested using numerical simulation varying the core permeability and the size of the core sample.

1132273,Enhanced Oil Recovery from Oil-Wet Carbonate Rock by Spontaneous Imbibition of Aqueous Surfactant Solutions.,2001,Dag Chun Standnes,,,,,Fakultet for naturvitenskap og teknologi NTNU,The main theme of this thesis is an experimental investigation of spontaneous imbibition (SI) of aqueous cationic surfactant solution into oil-wet carbonate (chalk- and dolomite cores). The static imbibition process is believed to represent the matrix flow of oil and water in a fractured reservoir. It was known that aqueous solution of C{sub 12}-N(CH{sub 3}){sub 3}Br (C12TAB) was able to imbibe spontaneously into nearly oil-wet chalk material. but the underlying mechanism was not understood. The present work was therefore initiated. with the following objectives: (1) Put forward a hypothesis for the chemical mechanism underlying the SI of C12TAB solutions into oil-wet chalk material based on experimental data and (2) Perform screening tests of low-cost commercially available surfactants for their ability to displace oil by SI of water into oil-wet carbonate rock material. It is essential for optimal use of the surfactant in field application to have detailed knowledge about the mechanism underlying the SI process. The thesis also discusses some preliminary experimental results and suggests mechanisms for enhanced oil recovery from oil-wet carbonate rock induced by supply of thermal energy.,True,I1QM5jwAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,32,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20276275,13634113933522165540,/scholar?cites=13634113933522165540,,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/20276275,0,0,0

Oil recovery from such reservoirs is usually determined by mass transfer function between matrix and fracture. A new dimensionless scaling group has been developed which is able to correctly account for variation in fluid viscosities (imbibing fluid viscosity larger than initial fluid viscosity) when scaling spontaneous imbibition data generated by numerical simulation.

Countercurrent flows can induce a stronger viscous coupling than during cocurrent flows. leading to deceleration of the phases. Even as water displaces oil cocurrently. the saturation gradient in the block induces countercurrent capillary diffusion. The extent of countercurrent flow may dominate the domain of the matrix block near the water‐exposed surfaces while cocurrent imbibition may dominate the domain near the oil‐exposed surfaces. implying that one unique effective relative permeability curve for each phase does not adequately represent the system.

The slope analysis is performed using the known exact analytical solution to infinite acting period of counter-current spontaneous imbibition. The proposed theoretically based wettability index offers some advantages over existing methods: (1) it is a better measure of the spontaneous imbibition potential of rock (because the magnitude is directly proportional to the imbibition rate); (2) there is no need for forced displacement data; (3) there is no need for waiting until the spontaneous imbibition process ceases completely; and (4) the data needed to run the new method are all easy to measure.

In some works published in the last 2 decades. it has. however. been claimed that local equilibrium is not reached in porous media. and therefore. opposite the classical local-equilibrium/self-similar approach. non-equilibrium effects should be taken into account in modeling multi-phase flow in porous media and. in particular. for the spontaneous imbibition process.

Conventional models must deal with this by manually changing the relative permeability curves depending on the observed flow regime. In this paper we use a novel two-phase momentum-equation-approach based on general mixture theory to generate effective relative permeabilities where this dependence (and others) is automatically captured. In particular. this formulation includes two viscous coupling effects: (i) Viscous drag between the flowing phases and the stagnant porous rock; (ii) viscous drag caused by momentum transfer between the flowing phases. The resulting generalized model will predict that during co-current flow the faster moving fluid accelerates the slow fluid. but is itself decelerated. while for counter-current flow they are …,True,I1QM5jwAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,25,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309170817306814,7661118525688835138,/scholar?cites=7661118525688835138,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pal_Andersen/publication/321860326_A_Mixture_Theory_Approach_to_Model_Co-_and_Counter-Current_Two-Phase_Flow_in_Porous_Media_Accounting_for_Viscous_Coupling/links/5a371ddd0f7e9b10d8484df9/A-Mixture-Theory-Approach-to-Model-Co-and-Counter-Current-Two-Phase-Flow-in-Porous-Media-Accounting-for-Viscous-Coupling.pdf,0,0,0

Evolution of cracks and microcracks could induce catastrophic material failure. Therefore. the detection/diagnostics and effective repair of cracks and microcracks are vital for ensuring the performance reliability. cost effectiveness and safety for polymer structures. Cracks and microcracks. however. are difficult to detect and often repair processes are complex.

The gas temperature of the plasma jet was found to be 625 K in an active zone between the electrodes and was found to increase in the afterglow. Based on these results. the PP films are placed as close as possible to the edge of the capillary in order to avoid thermal damage to the polymer. XPS results on the untreated and modified PP samples revealed incorporation of a significant amount of oxygen on the polymer surface. however. this oxygen inclusion is more pronounced for the argon/water vapour jet due to the higher radicals density in the jet afterglow.

1132331,Influence of capillary geometry and applied voltage on hydrogen peroxide and OH radical formation in ac underwater electrical discharges,2007,A Yu Nikiforov and Ch Leys,16,Plasma Sources Science and Technology,2,273,IOP Publishing,The generation of hydroxyl (OH) radicals and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in underwater capillary discharges with different geometries is studied. It is found that the efficiency of the production of these active species depends on the input power and on the length of the capillary. A maximal rate of H 2 O 2 generation of 3.6× 10− 3 mmol l s− 1 has been measured in a 1 mm capillary at a discharge power level of 77 W. The hydrogen peroxide yield is lower for the 1 mm capillary than for the 5 mm capillary. The kinetics of OH formation is investigated by recording emission spectra in the UV range (280–400 nm). It is shown that the rate of OH formation sharply decreases with increasing capillary length. for capillaries longer than 3 mm. A comparison of the efficiency of different plasma-solution reactors for the generation of active species has been carried out.

Unfortunately. conventional water treatment processes are not able to remove these micropollutants. As such. advanced treatment methods are required to meet both current and anticipated maximally allowed concentrations. Plasma discharge in contact with water is a promising new technology. since it produces a wide spectrum of oxidizing species. In this study. a new type of reactor is tested. in which decomposition by atmospheric pulsed direct barrier discharge (pDBD) plasma is combined with micropollutant adsorption on a nanofiber polyamide membrane. Atrazine is chosen as model micropollutant with an initial concentration of 30 μg/L.

To evaluate the oxidative stability a wide range of techniques has been described in literature. of which most are thermally based. These unrealistic test conditions result in the induction of deviating oxidation chemistry compared to that observed during ambient storage. Non-thermal plasma technology is capable to generate a wide range of highly reactive oxidative species (e.g. atomic oxygen. hydroxyl radicals. singlet oxygen) while maintaining ambient temperatures. For the first time. a DBD-plasma jet (Ar/0.6% O2) is used on fish oil samples as a faster and more realistic accelerated lipid oxidation method.

Today accelerated lipid oxidation methods are often temperature-based although it is known that widely divergent kinetics and side-reactions occur as a function of the employed temperature. In this paper both a thermally-based reference test and experiments using three types of plasma (Ar plasma. oxygen-doped Ar plasma. water-doped Ar plasma) were investigated. Treatment of fresh reference vegetable oil with pure argon plasma did not induce lipid oxidation reactions. Contrarily. a short treatment with both 0.3% O2/Argon and 0.3% H2O/Argon plasmas resulted in the production of several oxidation products that were also identified in naturally oxidized oil.

A review,2011,HAH Said-Al Ahl and EA Omer,57,Herba polonica,2,,-,Salinization of soils or waters is one of the world’s most serious environmental problems in agriculture. It is necessary to determine the environmental factors under which medicinal and aromatic plants give higher yields and better quality. The problem of salinity is characterized by an excess of inorganic salts and is common in the arid and semi-arid lands. where it has been naturally formed under the prevailing climatic conditions and due to higher rates of evapotranspiration and lack of leaching water. Although more frequent in arid lands. salt-affected soils are also present in areas where salinity is caused by poor quality of irrigation water. Saline soil induces physiological and metabolic disturbances in plants. affecting development. growth. yield. and quality of plants. Plants affects adversely as a result of salinity. seed germination. survival percentage. morphological characteristics. development and yield and its components. In general. salt stress decreases the photosynthesis and respiration rate of plants. Total carbohydrate. fatty acid and protein content were adversely affected due to salinity effect. but increased the level of amino acids. particularly proline.

The Mediterranean diet includes the consumption of large amounts of olive oil. Olive oil is a source of at least 30 phenolic compounds. The major phenolic compounds in olive oil are oleuropein. hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol. Recently there has been a surge in the number of publications that has investigated their biological properties. The phenolic compounds present in olive oil are strong antioxidants and radical scavengers. Olive “waste water” also possesses compounds which are strong antioxidant and radical scavengers.

GAD67 is constitutively active and is responsible for basal GABA production. In contrast. GAD65. an autoantigen in type I diabetes. is transiently activated in response to the demand for extra GABA in neurotransmission. and cycles between an active holo form and an inactive apo form. We have determined the crystal structures of N-terminal truncations of both GAD isoforms. The structure of GAD67 shows a tethered loop covering the active site. providing a catalytic environment that sustains GABA production.

1132432,Insights on virulence from the complete genome of Staphylococcus capitis,2015,David Cameron and Jhih-Hang Jiang and Karl Hassan and Liam Elbourne and Kellie Tuck and Ian Paulsen and Anton Peleg,6,Frontiers in microbiology,,980,Frontiers,Staphylococcus capitis is an opportunistic pathogen of the coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS). Functional genomic studies of S. capitis have thus far been limited by a lack of available complete genome sequences. Here. we determined the closed S. capitis genome and methylome using Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing. The strain. AYP1020. harbors a single circular chromosome of 2.44 Mb encoding 2304 predicted proteins. which is the smallest of all complete staphylococcal genomes sequenced to date. AYP1020 harbors two large mobile genetic elements; a plasmid designated pAYP1020 (59.6 Kb) and a prophage. ΦAYP1020 (48.5 Kb). Methylome analysis identified significant adenine methylation across the genome involving two distinct methylation motifs (1.972 putative 6-methyladenine (m6A) residues identified). Putative adenine methyltransferases were also identified. Comparative analysis of AYP1020 and the closely related CoNS. S. epidermidis RP62a. revealed a host of virulence factors that likely contribute to S. capitis pathogenicity. most notably genes important for biofilm formation and a suite of phenol soluble modulins (PSMs); the expression/production of these factors were corroborated by functional assays.

Deficiency of SSADH in humans results in elevated levels of GABA and γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). which leads to psychomotor retardation. muscular hypotonia. non-progressive ataxia and seizures. In Escherichia coli. two genetically distinct forms of SSADHs had been described that are essential for preventing accumulation of toxic levels of succinic semialdehyde (SSA) in cells.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we structurally characterise SSADH encoded by the E coli gabD gene by X-ray crystallographic studies and compare these data with the structure of human SSADH. In the E. coli SSADH structure. electron density for the complete NADP+ cofactor in the binding sites is clearly evident; these data in particular revealing how the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor is positioned in each active site.  Conclusions/Significance Our structural data suggest that a deletion of three amino acids in E. coli SSADH permits this enzyme to use NADP+. whereas in contrast the human enzyme utilises NAD+. Furthermore. the structure of E. coli SSADH gives additional insight into human mutations that result in disease.,True,PyWMxCgAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,31,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009280,5269683378590708269,/scholar?cites=5269683378590708269,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009280,0,0,0

One serious limitation of these nanostructures. however. is a large photoluminescence (PL) line width (typically >300 meV). the origin of which is still not fully understood. It remains even unclear whether the observed broadening results from considerable sample heterogeneities (due. e.g.. to size polydispersity) or is an unavoidable intrinsic property of individual QDs. Here. we answer this question by conducting single-particle measurements on a new type of CuInS2 (CIS) QDs with an especially thick ZnS shell.

An important characteristic of an LSC is a concentration factor (C) that can be thought of as a coefficient of effective enlargement (or contraction) of the area of a solar cell when it is coupled to the LSC. Here we use analytical and numerical Monte Carlo modeling in addition to experimental studies of quantum-dot-based LSCs to analyze the factors that influence optical concentration in practical devices.

Their effects on energies calculated with the equivalent of COSMO/CIS/AM1 are given for a set of test molecules with varying excited state charge transfer character. The resulting solvent effects are explained qualitatively using a dipole approximation. It is shown that the fundamental differences between these solvent models are reflected by the character of the calculated excitations.,True,_tM4YB4AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,25,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4905828,11677073876130057556,/scholar?cites=11677073876130057556,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1236613,0,0,0

Berkeley,Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are composed of covalently linked organic molecules. which are held together in specific geometric and spatial arrangements. 1-5 Research efforts have largely focused on varying the size and shape of the molecular building blocks to design the structural properties of COFs such as porosity. 5-15 In this report. we show how these building blocks can also be tuned electronically such that remote functionalization of linker units has a significant impact on the electronic character of molecular active sites embedded within the reticular superstructure and consequently. their accompanying reactivity. Within this context. we and others have recently identified COFs and their related MOF congeners as promising materials platforms for supporting molecular catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. 16-18 Indeed. extensive research has been devoted to the design of molecular catalysts that facilitate this chemical transformation. and while electrolytic approaches benefit from using water as a reaction medium that facilitates proton and electron transfer. its use also requires good selectivity of the catalyst over the competitive off-pathway reduction of water itself to hydrogen. 19-29 Consequently. systems used for this transformation must be tuned for both high reactivity and selectivity. 24. 30-36 Molecular CO2 reduction catalysts have been optimized in terms of activity and selectivity by functionalization of the organic ligands on the catalytically active metal center. as illustrated by extensive work on metalloporphyrin systems as a prime example. 37-43 Indeed. the direct …,True,zF92KfQAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC,0,https://escholarship.org/content/qt7319x8qd/qt7319x8qd_noSplash_c1ac79d024d43a241797ee30db67fdb3.pdf#page=137,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt7319x8qd/qt7319x8qd_noSplash_c1ac79d024d43a241797ee30db67fdb3.pdf#page=137,0,0,0

KGaA,Making fabric by weaving is known as one of the oldest and most enduring methods. Nevertheless such an important design concept still needs to be emulated in extended chemical structures. Linking molecules into weaving structures would be of a great help to create materials with exceptional mechanical properties and dynamics. For this purpose a woven covalent organic framework‐505 (COF‐505) has been synthesized using a designed strategy [1]. However. COF‐505 is not well crystallized. which gives rise to a poorly resolved PXRD pattern. Therefore. approaches based on electron crystallography methods have been used. The structure of this COF has been solved by a combination of 3D electron diffraction tomography (3D EDT.

This is due to the very high chiral amplifications of the initial small statistical deviations from the ideal racemic composition. Moreover. this system is sensitive to very small chiral polarizations (energy differences between transition states below the mJ mol−1 range). This behaviour can also be observed in reversible exergonic reactions. because the racemization time scale is substantially longer than that of the transformation of the initial reagents.

The possibility of a connection arises in that wormholes. if they exist. might have profound influence on black holes. their event horizons. and their internal structure. After discussing some connections. we embark on an overview of what can generally be said about traversable wormhole throats. We discuss the violations of the energy conditions that typically occur at and near the throat of any traversable wormhole and emphasize the generic nature of this result. We discuss the original Morris-Thorne wormhole and its generalization to a spherically symmetric time-dependent wormhole. and also discuss spherically symmetric Brans-Dicke wormholes. We also discuss the relationship with the topological censorship theorem. Finally we turn to a rather general class of wormholes that permit explicit analysis: generic static traversable wormholes (without any symmetry). We define the wormhole throat in terms of a 2--dimensional constant-time hypersurface of minimal area.(Zero trace for the extrinsic curvature plus a``flare--out''condition.)

In the simplest case of the local string. the new term is just the extrinsic curvature of the world sheet.

The reaction steps are assumed to be reversible. implying a thermodynamic constraint among some of the rate constants. Absolute asymmetric synthesis is achieved in this scheme. The system can persist for long times in quasi-stationary chiral asymmetric states before racemizing.

The effect of impurity content and processing state on the bio-corrosion properties of two pure magnesiums in the physiological saline solution were investigated. The results showed that both the reduction of impurity content and the grain refinement can enhance the open circuit potential of pure magnesium and decrease the corrosion rate in the physiological saline solution. The corrosion rate of pure magnesium can be controlled through ways of changing the impurity content. grain refinement and solution treatment. which makes magnesium suitable as a new type of pre-developed bio-degradable metal material,True,Rx-Ks4oAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC,46,https://www.jcscp.org/EN/abstract/abstract4515.shtml,4504692812215327408,/scholar?cites=4504692812215327408,,,0,0,0

Data,10,3216-3228,,With the intention to explore bile salts applications as drug delivery vehicles. the mixed interfacial as well as micellar behavior of the sodium salt of ibuprofen (NaIbuF) and bile salts mixtures in aqueous/electrolyte solutions has been evaluated by tensiometric method at 298.15 K. Bile salts (sodium cholate (NaC) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC)) used in the present study are anionic in nature and form small micelles. Various theoretical models such as Clint. Rubingh. and Rosen were utilized to acquire information concerning the nature of interaction among the components in the solution as well as at the interface. Because of the presence of inorganic salt (100 mmol· kg− 1 NaCl) a decrease in the surface charge of the micelles takes place and ensuing micellization occurs at poorer concentration. The value of the micellar mole fraction (X1 m) is found to be greater for NaIbuF+ NaDC mixtures in comparison to NaIbuF+ NaC mixtures. signifying that participation of NaDC is greater in mixed micelles as compared to NaC. An attractive interaction was obtained in the micelle and at the interface. because it is obvious from interaction parameters (βm. β σ). The values of ΔG0 m for all systems was negative in the absence as well as in the occurrence of salt. Micelle aggregation number (Nagg). estimated by means of steady-state fluorescence quenching studies. suggests that the contribution of bile salts was always greater than that of the NaIbuF.

Their catalytic efficiency is ascribed to the presence of Ni sites on the bimetallic surface that not only hinder the surface corrosion of the iron sites but also facilitate efficient electron flow from the catalyst surface to the adsorbed nitro compounds. This facet is corroborated with reusability studies as well as surface characterization of the catalyst before and after its repetitive usage. Thus. these nanoparticles efficiently catalyze the reduction of functionalized nitroarenes to corresponding amines without use of corrosive agents like base or other additives under ambient conditions and are easily separated by a laboratory magnet in an eco-friendly manner.,True,Wf6tpaIAAAAJ:eLRq4zTgah0C,38,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/ra/c3ra45787g,12497476197426148994,/scholar?cites=12497476197426148994,,,0,0,0

The metal complexes of Co+2. Ni+2. Cu+2. and Zn+2 were characterized and investigated by physical and spectral techniques. namely. elemental analysis. melting point. conductivity. 1H NMR. IR. UV-Vis spectra. ESR. SEM. and mass spectrometry measurements. They were further analyzed by thermal technique (TGA/DTA) to gain better insight about the thermal stability and kinetic properties of the complexes. Thermal data revealed high thermal stability and nonspontaneous nature of the decomposition steps. The Coats-Redfern method was applied to extract thermodynamic parameters to explain the kinetic behavior. The molar conductance values were relatively low. showing their nonelectrolytic nature. The powder XRD pattern revealed amorphous nature except copper complex (1c) that crystallized in the triclinic crystal system. The EPR study strongly recommends the tetrahedral geometry of 1c. The structure optimization by MM force field calculation through ArgusLab 4.0.1 software program supports the concerned geometry of the complexes. The in vitro antibacterial activity of all the compounds. at their two different concentrations. was screened against four bacterial pathogens. namely. E. coli. P. vulgaris.

For this purpose. a new symmetrical self-immolative biscarbazate linker has been devised. The hydrazide group was used to form hydrazone cross-linked hydrogel upon treating with previously described aldehyde modified hyaluronan. The 1:1 weight ratio of these two polymers gave hydrogel in less than 30 s.

In order to improve the clinical translation of rhBMP-2. there exists strong motivation to engineer better delivery systems. Hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel is a suitable carrier for the delivery of rhBMP-2. but a major limitation of this scaffold is its low cell adhesive properties. In this study. we have determined whether covalent grafting of an integrin-specific ligands into HA hydrogel could improve cell attachment and further enhance the osteogenic potential of rhBMP-2. A structurally stabilized fibronectin (FN) fragment containing the major integrin-binding domain of full-length FN (FN III9∗-10) was engineered. in order to be incorporated into HA hydrogel.

Hyaluronan (HA)‐based hydrogel is one attractive biomaterial candidate because it is involved in natural healing processes. including inflammation. granulation. and reepithelialization. Herein. dynamic metal–ligand coordination bonds are used to fabricate moldable supramolecular HA hydrogels with self‐healing properties. To achieve reversible crosslinking of HA chains. the biopolymer is modified with pendant bisphosphonate (BP) ligands using carbodiimide coupling and chemoselective “click” reactions.

To achieve this. we have prepared a hyaluronic acid (HA) derivative that is dually functionalized with cross-linkable hydrazide groups and bisphosphonate ligands (HA-hy-BP). The hybrid hydrogel can be formed by simple mixing of two solutions: the solution of HA-hy-BP and the Ca2+ ions containing solution of aldehyde-derivatized HA (HA-al). We found that the conjugation of BP. a P–C–P analogue of pyrophosphate. to the hydrogel matrix promotes an efficient and fast mineralization of the matrix.

Open water (whole stream) metabolism methods have been used since the pioneering work of Odum (1956) to investigate rates of gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR) in lotic systems and to relate these rates to instream and catchment characteristics. The intention is to standardize methods for the collection and analysis of metabolism data across the country to enable data comparison and develop greater understanding of how metabolism responds to factors at local. catchment and biogeographical scales. Such standardization is also seen as essential for the incorporation of stream metabolism measures into regional and national stream health assessment programs.Measurements of GPP and CR are relatively simple–they are obtained directly from the production and consumption of dissolved oxygen in the stream water. Such measurements are performed in the main stream flowpath (“open water” methods) or in enclosures called benthic chambers. Open water metabolism methods involve measuring the diel variation in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the water and are based on the premise that changes in the DO concentration are the result of photosynthesis. respiration and gas exchange with the atmosphere (ie reaeration). Chambers are placed into the stream and then the dissolved oxygen concentration is monitored over an appropriate incubation period.

The division of nitrogen between biotic assimilation and denitrification in stormwater biofiltration systems,2014,Emily GI Payne and Tim D Fletcher and Douglas G Russell and Michael R Grace and Timothy R Cavagnaro and Victor Evrard and Ana Deletic and Belinda E Hatt and Perran LM Cook,9,PloS one,3,e90890,Public Library of Science,The long-term efficacy of stormwater treatment systems requires continuous pollutant removal without substantial re-release. Hence. the division of incoming pollutants between temporary and permanent removal pathways is fundamental. This is pertinent to nitrogen. a critical water body pollutant. which on a broad level may be assimilated by plants or microbes and temporarily stored. or transformed by bacteria to gaseous forms and permanently lost via denitrification. Biofiltration systems have demonstrated effective removal of nitrogen from urban stormwater runoff. but to date studies have been limited to a ‘black-box’ approach. The lack of understanding on internal nitrogen processes constrains future design and threatens the reliability of long-term system performance. While nitrogen processes have been thoroughly studied in other environments. including wastewater treatment wetlands. biofiltration systems differ fundamentally in design and the composition and hydrology of stormwater inflows. with intermittent inundation and prolonged dry periods. Two mesocosm experiments were conducted to investigate biofilter nitrogen processes using the stable isotope tracer 15NO3− (nitrate) over the course of one inflow event. The immediate partitioning of 15NO3− between biotic assimilation and denitrification were investigated for a range of different inflow concentrations and plant species. Assimilation was the primary fate for NO3− under typical stormwater concentrations (∼1–2 mg N/L). contributing an average 89–99% of 15NO3− processing in biofilter columns containing the most effective plant species. while only 0–3% was denitrified and 0–8 …,True,8P-iBAMAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,74,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090890,4965889175121250857,/scholar?cites=4965889175121250857,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090890,0,0,0

These pavements were monolithic Porous Asphalt (PA). Permapave (PP). and modular Hydrapave (HP).The pavements were dosed with a semi-synthetic stormwater mixture over a continuous period of 20 weeks. at a flow rate of 3.9 mm/hr. the intensity of which corresponds to the 90 th percentile of an average recurrence interval (ARI) storm in Melbourne or the mean of an ARI storm in Brisbane. Australia. Inflow and outflow samples were collected and analysed for key pollutants such as total suspended solids (TSS). total phosphorus (TP). total nitrogen (TN). heavy metals and dissolved nutrients. Flow rates. pH and temperature readings were also measured. A 1 in 5 year Brisbane storm. which is equivalent to more than a 1 in 100 year Melbourne storm was simulated in the 6 th. 10 th and 17 th weeks to evaluate the rate of clogging; this corresponded to 5.5. 10.4 and 17.5 years of operation in Melbourne. or about half these periods in Brisbane.,True,8P-iBAMAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,44,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mike_Grace/publication/237204622_The_clogging_behaviour_and_treatment_efficiency_of_a_range_of_porous_pavements/links/0c960531fa2aee7f0f000000/The-clogging-behaviour-and-treatment-efficiency-of-a-range-of-porous-pavements.pdf,12875385766633676928,/scholar?cites=12875385766633676928,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mike_Grace/publication/237204622_The_clogging_behaviour_and_treatment_efficiency_of_a_range_of_porous_pavements/links/0c960531fa2aee7f0f000000/The-clogging-behaviour-and-treatment-efficiency-of-a-range-of-porous-pavements.pdf,0,0,0

Interestingly. in several cases. the oligosaccharide conformation recognized by the ribosomic RNA and the enzymes responsible for the antibiotic inactivation is remarkably different. This observation suggests a possible structure-based chemical strategy to overcome bacterial resistance; in principle. it should be possible to design a conformationally locked oligosaccharide that still retains antibiotic activity but that is not susceptible to enzymatic inactivation.

In recent years. samarium diiodide2 has evolved as a unique single electron reducing agent that is especially well suited to promote sequential processes that combine radical and anionic steps with a high degree of chemoand stereoselectivity. 3 On the basis of the rich chemistry uncovered for this reagent. we hypothesized that its interaction with a 6-deoxy-6-iodohexopyranoside derivative A (Scheme 1) could trigger a reaction cascade that would eventually lead to a novel ring contraction4. 5 of the pyranose moiety. This sequence requires four SET steps (ie. 4 mol equiv of SmI2) and consists of (1) a reductive dealkoxyhalogenation to give the ring-opened hex-5-enal B; 6 (2) an intramolecular ketyl-olefin reductive coupling affording the ring-contracted organosamarium intermediate C. 3a-c. 7 and (3) the intermolecular trapping of this organosamarium with appropriate electrophiles to produce finally the branched cyclopentitol derivative D. 3a-c We report here the successful implementation of the postulated process for a series of 6-deoxy-6-iodohexopyranosides (1-7) 8. 9 (Table 1) of different configuration and substitution pattern and initial studies of the influence of the reaction conditions and protecting groups on the outcome of the reaction.,True,myKPDWcAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,45,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/30925/1/jo961116%252B.pdf,12826977746670972275,/scholar?cites=12826977746670972275,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/30925/1/jo961116%252B.pdf,0,0,0

The present developments take advantage of the highly automated experimental set-ups and unique x-ray radiation characteristics available at third-generation synchrotron radiation sources. The sensitivity of the x-ray absorption cross-section to the local structural order makes it possible to investigate the occurrence of phase transitions. We show that by tuning the photon energy to a spectral feature that is highly sensitive to the sample phase it is possible to follow the occurrence and the characteristics of the phase transition. The sensitivity to the atomic fraction of the sample in a certain phase can be in the range. The energy tunability can be used to enhance the sensitivity to structural or electronic transformations.

In this work. we show that highly blue fluorescent model types of CDs can be prepared from citric acid and ethylenediamine through low temperature synthesis routes. Facilitating controlled polycondensation processes. the CDs reveal sizes of 1–1.5 nm formed by a compact network of short polyamide chains of about 10 monomer units. Density functional theory calculations of these model CDs uncover the existence of a spatially separated highest occupied molecular orbital and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital located at the amide and carboxylic groups. respectively.

Cr2. Mo2 and W2. The PNOF5. Piris Natural Orbital Functional. has been used throughout this work. and the results are compared to multireferential perturbation theory (CASPT2) results. Both methods have been combined with effective core potentials to take into account the scalar relativistic effects. In addition. for Cr2. an all-electron TZVP quality basis set has also been used to recover the core-valence dynamical correlation. In all cases. PNOF5 shows better behavior than CASPT2. which needs a larger basis set to recover comparable amounts of dynamical correlation. PNOF5 is able to account for the non-dynamical electron correlation. which is responsible for the multireferential nature of these dimers. However. it does not fully recover the dynamical correlation. which is …,True,vS_5DQkAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,39,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2012/cp/c2cp43559d,7763882477619940070,/scholar?cites=7763882477619940070,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45086714/The_natural_orbital_functional_theory_of20160425-18997-18u04za.pdf,0,0,0

The geometry of the global minima is ringlike for i= 1–5 and three-dimensional (3D) spheroidlike for i= 6–9. In general. the calculated excitations happen from nonbonding p orbitals of sulfur. These orbitals are perpendicular to the molecular plane in the case of the rings. and normal to the spheroid surface for 3D clusters. The calculated excitation energies are larger for ringlike clusters as compared to 3D ones. with the excitation energies of the latter structures lying close to the visible spectrum. The difference between Kohn-Sham eigenvalues of the orbitals involved in the electronic excitations studied have also been compared with the TDDFT results of the corresponding excitations for two approximate density functionals. ie. MPW1PW91 and B3LYP. the latter being more accurate.

Anodic oxidation of the basal plane in citrate-acetate buffer results in long-term changes in the electrochemical properties of this surface. Charge-transfer rates are greatly increased for both reduction and oxidation. The modified basal plane operates for extended periods of time without further surface modification as a detector for compounds separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The electrode performance compares very favorably with carbon paste electrodes for the detection of trace amounts of oxidizable organic compounds. and Is comparable to reported mercury electrodes for the detection of reducible organic compounds.,True,UDJnY2IAAAAJ:1paMEeroeoQC,110,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac50033a010,15228095333567485411,/scholar?cites=15228095333567485411,,,0,0,0

This barrier is the transition state. a species whose reacting bonds are midway to being formed or broken. as the case may be. transition states are dynamical bottlenecks to reaction. defining the critical point of no return where potentially reacting species convert to products or return to reactants. Enzymes can aid reactions by binding and lowering the energies of transition states. thus making it easier for enzyme substrates to traverse reaction paths. Most enzymologists believe this is the basic way most enzymes work-that transition-state binding and stabilization are primarily responsible for catalytic rate acceleration. However this view has been undergoing considerable refinement. as researchers study phenomena that may underlie. accompany. or even supersede transition-state stabilization-such …,True,UDJnY2IAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,46,https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=7571915,17958569784166277042,/scholar?cites=17958569784166277042,,,0,0,0

1132973,The many faces of combinatoral chemistry,2003,Stu Borman,81,Chemical & engineering news,43,45-45,Proquest ABI/INFORM,Combinatorial chemistry continues to evolve as a potentially speedy route to new drugs. catalysts. and other useful compounds and materials. Yet the field is facing increasing criticism for not having delivered results fast enough to justify the huge investments made in it by industry. academia. and government. Synthesizing or purchasing libraries of purified. discrete compounds has become the norm at many drug companies. For the most part. libraries are being made either by parallel synthesis or by mixture synthesis with directed sorting.

Corrosion is a complex process that involves chemical reactions occurring at the interface between a material and its environment and is. therefore. highly suited to study by atomistic modeling techniques. In this paper. the complex nature of corrosion processes and mechanisms is briefly reviewed. Various atomistic methods for exploring corrosion mechanisms are then described. and recent applications in the literature surveyed. Several instances of the application of atomistic modeling to corrosion science are then reviewed in detail. including studies of the metal-water interface. the reaction of water on electrified metallic interfaces. the dissolution of metal atoms from metallic surfaces. and the role of competitive adsorption in controlling the chemical nature and structure of a metallic surface. Some perspectives are then given concerning the future of atomistic modeling in the field of corrosion science.,True,Z_8KW7oAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,33,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijc/2012/204640/abs/,16965693621893346811,/scholar?cites=16965693621893346811,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijc/2012/204640/abs/,0,0,0

We have examined a series of metals important for electrochemical energy generation and corrosion-resistant alloy development including Ni. Cu. Ru. Au. Mo. Pd. and Pt. Advances in electrochemical theory depend on a detailed understanding of the interplay between surface chemistry and electrochemical phenomena. Herein. we have used ab initio quantum-mechanical methods to examine the double-layer regions for over these metals and compare the equilibrium potentials for the initial steps of water reduction and oxidation at the surface with known experimental quantities.

The eigenstates of these operators come in pairs. and can be considered as bonding. anti-bonding and lone-pair orbitals. The form of these operators is derived by generalising the rule that the bond order be defined as the net number of bonding electron pairs. The percentage of covalency and ionicity of a chemical bond may be obtained. and bond indices can also be defined between groups of atoms. The calculation of the bond indices depends only on the electron density operator. and certain projection operators used to represent each atom in the molecule.

Despite the powerful therapeutic potential of siRNA. there are challenges for developing efficient and specific delivery systems for systemic administration. There are extracellular and intracellular barriers for nanoparticle-mediated delivery. First. nanoparticles are rapidly cleared from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Second. following their cellular uptake. nanoparticles are trapped in endosomes/lysosomes. where siRNA would be degraded by enzymes. In this review. we describe strategies for grafting a polyethylene glycol (PEG) brush to the nanoparticles for evading RES. such that they may effectively accumulate in the tumor by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.

1133136,Predicting bankruptcy with robust logistic regression,2011,Richard P Hauser and David Booth,9,Journal of Data Science,4,565-584,中華資料採礦協會,Using financial ratio data from 2006 and 2007. this study uses a three-fold cross validation scheme to compare the classification and prediction of bankrupt firms by robust logistic regression with the Bianco and Yohai (BY) estimator versus maximum likelihood (ML) logistic regression. With both the 2006 and 2007 data. BY robust logistic regression improves both the classification of bankrupt firms in the training set and the prediction of bankrupt firms in the testing set. In an out of sample test. the BY robust logistic regression correctly predicts bankruptcy for Lehman Brothers; however. the ML logistic regression never predicts bankruptcy for Lehman Brothers with either the 2006 or 2007 data. Our analysis indicates that if the BY robust logistic regression significantly changes the estimated regression coefficients from ML logistic regression. then the BY robust logistic regression method can significantly improve the classification and prediction of bankrupt firms. At worst. the BY robust logistic regression makes no changes in the estimated regression coefficients and has the same classification and prediction results as ML logistic regression. This is strong evidence that BY robust logistic regression should be used as a robustness check on ML logistic regression. and if a difference exists. then BY robust logistic regression should be used as the primary classifier.,True,ZO8kR3cAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,76,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Booth14/post/How_to_estimate_the_Bianco-Yohai_Robust_Logistic_Regression/attachment/5a9a2004b53d2f0bba559016/AS:599948093566976@1520050180408/download/JDS-716.pdf,2147517494374353572,/scholar?cites=2147517494374353572,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Booth14/post/How_to_estimate_the_Bianco-Yohai_Robust_Logistic_Regression/attachment/5a9a2004b53d2f0bba559016/AS:599948093566976@1520050180408/download/JDS-716.pdf,0,0,0

This finding underlines the importance of handling outliers in event studies. We further review closely the population of outliers identified using Cook’s distance and find that many of the outliers lie within the event windows. We acknowledge that those data points lead to inaccurate regression fitting; however. we cannot remove them since they carry valuable information regarding the event effect. We study further the residuals of the outliers within event windows and find that the residuals change with application of M-estimators and MM-estimators; in most cases they became larger. meaning the main prediction equation is pulled back towards the main data population and further from the outliers and indicating more proper fitting. We support our empirical results by pseudosimulation experiments and find significant improvement in determination of both types of the event effect-abnormal returns and change in systematic risk.

Fuzzy clustering is based on fuzzy logic. and the hybrid system is designed to address the going concern decision through the combined use of a statistical model and an expert system. These models have the capability of identifying categories of firms with particular characteristics that may indicate whether or not the audit report of the firms requires a going concern modification. A prediction of whether or not a firm may go bankrupt is included as one of the components of the going concern decision.

Because JE is able to differentiate between four different outlier (out-of-control observation) types. performance is reported with respect to its ability to locate the out-of-control observation and identify the associated type. This is of particular interest to practitioners because the four different types may indicate different problems in the process. The results show that JE performs better for AR(1) models when the out-of-control observation is the last observation than for MA(1) models. However.

1133152,A neural network approach to the detection of nuclear material losses,1996,James H Hamburg and David E Booth and G Jay Weinroth,36,Journal of chemical information and computer sciences,3,544-553,American Chemical Society,A series of repeated nuclear material balances forms a time series of often autocorrelated observations. Outliers. deviations from an in-control production process or time series pattern. indicate an out-of-control situation relative to the process norm. In this paper various methods. especially neural networks. will be examined with respect to their use to detect nuclear material diversions or losses more rapidly and accurately than currently used methods. The neural network technique will be enhanced with the use of a simulation computer program for creating the training data set. This simulation approach provides the opportunity of including outliers of various types in a data set for training the neural network because an actual process data set used for training possibly may not have outliers. In this paper. the methods will be compared on their ability to identify outliers and reduce false alarms.

1133153,The Detection of Nuclear Materials Losses,1995,Sameer Prasad and David Booth and Michael Y Hu and Seyda Deligonul,26,Decision Sciences,2,265-281,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,The identification and location of materials losses in nuclear facilities is an important issue. Many complexities arise in monitoring such losses. These complexities include the dependency among materials balance observations and the influence of errors (outliers) on parameter estimates of various monitoring methods. The proposed Joint Estimation procedure is superior to standard methods (control chart and CUSUM) and to methods that build in correlation (ARMA control chart. ARMA CUSUM. and the Generalized M procedure) in the detection of nuclear materials losses. The Joint Estimation procedure is robust to the influence of outliers. is flexible in accommodating a range of dependencies among observations. and provides information on the type of loss. Further. the procedure is reliable in that it yields a probability of false alarms and a probability of detecting losses closer to specifications.,True,ZO8kR3cAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,15,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5915.1995.tb01429.x,707684740307678658,/scholar?cites=707684740307678658,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Booth14/publication/229882663_The_Detection_of_Nuclear_Materials_Losses/links/5e341bd5a6fdccd965797274/The-Detection-of-Nuclear-Materials-Losses.pdf,0,0,0
1133154,Monitoring the quality of a chemical production process using the joint estimation method,1995,Sameer Prasad and David Booth and Michael Y Hu,35,Journal of chemical information and computer sciences,1,53-58,American Chemical Society,The standard approach to monitoring a chemical production processis the control chart. Such a chart assumes that the data values are independent and identically distributed. It has been shown that such is not so for many production processes especially those of chemical interest. However a more realistic approach to the problem can be developed using time series modeling. A recent development in time series methodology. the joint estimation procedure. allows for the detection and identification of four types of outliers. This study draws the correspondence between these outlier types and out-of-control situations (that is. adverse process changes) in chemical process control. The correspondence is illustrated in this study using a dye liquor data set. Results show that the joint estimation procedure is appropriate for use in process control and provides advantages for dealing with out-of-control problems in …,True,ZO8kR3cAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,15,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ci00023a008,6711858717857550696,/scholar?cites=6711858717857550696,,,0,0,0

Unfortunately. classifying objects (e.g.. patients) on the basis of clinical and/or laboratory experimental observations into various groups can be difficult when the groups overlap or contain outlying points.

Results of a field trial in a rural area are presented and show excellent reproducibility and precision even at low ambient concentrations. Values for samples collected over 23 h runs were in the range 0.8–2.1 μm −3for nitric acid and 0.6–1.2 μm−3 for particulate nitrate. During the field test gaseous nitric acid showed strong diurnal changes and particle nitrates did not.

Using these together with the neon 2s ionization potential for calibration. 1s ionization potentials have been determined for CF/sub 4/ (C = 301.96. F = 695.57). CO/sub 2/ (C = 297.71. O = 541.32).

The results are in good agreement with those of other measurements but have significantly smaller uncertainties. Comparison is made between experimental and theoretical ionization potentials. The value for neon is quite close to a recently reported theoretical value of 870.0 eV.

Similar mutually beneficial relationships can operate at the molecular level in the form of a hypercycle. a collective of two or more self-replicating species interlinked through a cyclic catalytic network 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The superposition of cross-catalysis onto autocatalytic replication integrates the members of the hypercycle into a single system that reproduces through a second-order (or higher) form of nonlinear autocatalysis.

To develop a new tool to study RecA function. we engineered artificial small RNAs (sRNAs) that can posttranscriptionally repress RecA expression in Escherichia coli. The artificial sRNAs mimic the bacterial noncoding sRNAs which possess an antisense domain that is partially complementary to the targeted mRNA. We screened a library of artificial sRNAs with a randomized antisense domain and isolated several anti-recA sRNAs that can knockdown the endogenous RecA level in E. coli.

Air or oxygen exposure is found to increase the WF of ITO (UV-exposed) to a value of 4.6 eV. These changes of ITO's WF lead to reversible variations of the performance of organic photovoltaic devices where ITO acts primarily as the electron collecting or hole collecting electrode. These variations can be reflected in the disappearance (or appearance) of an S-shaped kink in the J–V characteristics upon continuous UV or solar simulator illumination (or air exposure).

As a result. research into interfacial transport at planar organic monolayer junctions has treated molecular systems as thermally ballistic.

Most referral hospital EDs provide their essential ED information to the National Emergency Medical Center through the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS). We analyzed the NEDIS data on pediatric visits (< 19 yr old) during three years. from June 1. 2008 to May 31. 2010. A total of 2.072.664 children visited 124 EDs during the study period. and this patient population comprised 31.2% of the total ED visits. Male patients with a mean age of 5.44 (±5.40 SD) yr comprised 59.1% of the ED pediatric visits. Among all age groups. the 1-4-yr-old group was the largest (42.3%). The most common mode of arrival was non-emergency medical service (EMS)(90.7%). and only 4.2% of patients used EMS transport. Common chief complaints in infants were fever (37.4%). whereas many older children presented to the EDs with abdominal pain (15.4%). The ratio of disease versus injury as the cause of ED visits was 2.5: 1. Most patients were discharged (81.2%). and 15.3% were admitted. In conclusion. the most common age group who are brought to EDs in Korea is 1 to 4 yr-old young children. and common chief complaints of the visiting children are age-dependent. such as fever in younger children and abdominal pain and headache in older children.

BackgroundThe incorporation of lasers as light sources in analytical spectroscopic instrumentation has resulted in spectacular detection limits. These detection limits arise from several unique properties of laser radiation. As an example. the spectral purity and high power of the laser facilitates detection of individual gas phase atoms with isotopic resolution by both fluorescence and ionization techniques.1−3 The temporal coherence of the laser has been used to discriminate signals generated by very fast scatter processes from relatively slower luminescence relaxation.4. 5 In addition. the spatial coherence of the laser allows measurement by thermo-optical techniques of very small absorbance. the subject of this review.

Here we measure the surface deformation at the air–water interface induced by continuous and pulsed laser excitation and match this to rigorous theory of radiation forces. We demonstrate that the experimental results are quantitatively described by the numerical calculations of radiation forces. The Helmholtz force is used for the surface radiation pressure.

However. with the recent advent of affordable digital processor-based data acquisition systems. real-time digital filtering is becoming an ever-increasing facet of the modern analytical laboratory. Proper use of digital filters can result in data with dramatically improved signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios and in the simplification of complex information.

1133357,Diffraction effects in single-and two-laser photothermal lens spectroscopy,1997,Stephen E Bialkowski and Agnès Chartier,36,Applied optics,27,6711-6721,Optical Society of America,A simple method for calculating the effects of optical geometry on photothermal lens signals is shown. This method is based on calculating cumulative electric-field phase shifts produced by a series of Gaussian refractive-index perturbations produced by the photothermal effect. Theoretical results are found for both pulsed-laser and continuous Gaussian laser excitation sources and both single- and two-laser apparatuses commonly employed in photothermal lens spectroscopy. The effects of apparatus geometry on the resulting signal are shown. Analytical time-dependent signal results are found for small signals. Analytical pump–probe focus geometry results allow direct optimization for certain conditions. The calculations indicate that the photothermal lens signal is. in general. optimized for near-field detection-plane geometries.,True,vPJ1kFQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,31,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-36-27-6711,6750123564530410150,/scholar?cites=6750123564530410150,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.854.790&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1133358,Photothermal lens spectrometry of homogeneous fluids with incoherent white-light excitation using a cylindrical sample cell,1997,Agnes Chartier and Stephen E Bialkowski,36,Optical Engineering,2,303-311,International Society for Optics and Photonics,A model for photothermal lens signal generation in a cylindrical sample cell under constant irradiance excitation is described and tested. The model is developed with and without the assumption that the sample cell does not change temperature over the irradiation time. In both cases. the photothermal lens is predicted to be parabolic in form with a strength that is independent of sample cell radius. The predicted irradiance independence suggests that incoherent illumination can be used to perform photothermal lens spectroscopy in low-volume cells. Experimental evidence is obtained using a Xe arc lamp to perform photothermal lens spectroscopy in a 6 L cylindrical spectrophotometric cell. Optical filters are used to reduce the power at IR and UV wavelengths of the Xe lamp emission spectrum.

This method is based on a beam-fanning optical limiter in photorefractive BaTiO_3. The resulting signal is not linear but does exhibit an enhanced signal-to-background ratio that is 4 to 6 orders of magnitude better than that of conventional infrared absorption spectrophotometry in the shot-noise limit.

Successful development of the technology hinges on the availability of stable cathodes. The reactivity exhibited by a carbon support compromises the cyclability of Li–O2 operation.

Using a TiSi2 nanonet as a high surface area. conductive support. we obtained a new noncarbon cathode material that corrects the deficiency. To enable oxygen reduction and evolution. Ru nanoparticles were deposited by atomic layer deposition onto TiSi2 nanonets. A surprising site-selective growth whereupon Ru nanoparticles only deposit onto the b planes of TiSi2 was observed.

Because only a few studies have focused on the flavonoid structural requirements for neuroprotection. this work evaluated the protective capacity of 13 flavones structurally related to quercetin. isolated from Kenyan plants. to rescue primary cerebellar granule neurons from death induced by a treatment with 24 h of hydrogen peroxide (150 μM).

Inc.,This research was to investigate the conversion of bagasse into a thermomoldable material through esterification of the fiber matrix. For this purpose. bagasse fiber was esterified in the absence of solvent using succinic anhydride. The dimensional stability and mechanical properties of composites prepared from the esterified fibers were studied. Dimensional stability was found to be dependent on the total ester and monoester/diester content of esterified fibers and increased with increasing total ester and monoester content of the fibers. The mechanical properties (bending strength. tensile strength. and hardness) were enhanced with increasing monoester contents. Scanning electron microscopy was used to prove the occurrence of thermoplasticization of the esterified fibers. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons. Inc.

We analyze hexamers (oligopeptides of six amino acid residues) and show that their structure tends to concentrate in specific clusters rather than vary continuously. Thus. we can use a limited set ofstandard structural building blocks taken from these clusters as representatives of the repertoire of observed hexamers. We demonstrate that protein structures can be approximated by concatenating such building blocks. We have identified about 100 building blocks by applying clustering algorithms. and have shown that they can “replace” about 76% ofall hexamers in well‐refined known proteins with an error of less than 1 Å. and can be joined together to cover 99% of the residues.

1133648,Potential biological applications of bio-based anacardic acids and their derivatives,2015,Fatma B Hamad and Egid B Mubofu,16,,4,8569-8590,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Cashew nut shells (CNS). which are agro wastes from cashew nut processing factories. have proven to be among the most versatile bio-based renewable materials in the search for functional materials and chemicals from renewable resources. CNS are produced in the cashew nut processing process as waste. but they contain cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) up to about 30–35 wt.% of the nut shell weight depending on the method of extraction. CNSL is a mixture of anacardic acid. cardanol. cardol. and methyl cardol. and the structures of these phenols offer opportunities for the development of diverse products. For anacardic acid. the combination of phenolic. carboxylic. and a 15-carbon alkyl side chain functional group makes it attractive in biological applications or as a synthon for the synthesis of a multitude of bioactive compounds. Anacardic acid. which is about 65% of a CNSL mixture. can be extracted from the agro waste. This shows that CNS waste can be used to extract useful chemicals and thus provide alternative green sources of chemicals. apart from relying only on the otherwise declining petroleum based sources. This paper reviews the potential of anacardic acids and their semi-synthetic derivatives for antibacterial. antitumor. and antioxidant activities. The review focuses on natural anacardic acids from CNS and other plants and their semi-synthetic derivatives as possible lead compounds in medicine. In addition. the use of anacardic acid as a starting material for the synthesis of various biologically active compounds and complexes is reported.

1133650,Castor oil as a potential renewable resource for the production of functional materials,2016,Egid B Mubofu,4,,1,1-12,SpringerOpen,Castor oil is increasingly becoming an important bio-based raw material for industrial applications. The oil is non-edible and can be extracted from castor seeds from the castor plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. The oil is a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid esters linked to a glycerol. The presence of hydroxyl group. a double bond. carboxylic group and a long chain hydrocarbon in ricinoleic acid (a major component of the oil). offer several possibilities of transforming it into variety of materials. The oil is thus a potential alternative to petroleum-based starting chemicals for the production of materials with variety of properties. Despite this huge potential. very little has recently been reviewed on the use of castor oil as a bio-resource in the production of functional materials. This review therefore highlights the potential of castor oil in the production of these diverse materials with their projected global market potential. The review gives the background information of castor oil and its geographical availability. the properties and its uses as bio-based resource for synthesis of various materials.

Ltd.,A comparative study of specific acid catalysis and Lewis acid catalysis of Diels–Alder reactions between dienophiles (1. 4 and 6) and cyclopentadiene (2) in water and mixed aqueous media is reported. The reactions were performed in water with copper(II) nitrate as the Lewis acid catalyst whereas hydrochloric acid was employed for specific acid catalysis. At equimolar amounts of copper(II) nitrate and hydrochloric acid (0.01 M. for example) and under the same reaction conditions. the reaction rate for 1a with 2 is about 40 times faster with copper catalysis than with specific acid catalysis. Moreover. at 32°C and 0.01 M HCl. the reaction of 1b with 2 is about 21 times faster than the same uncatalyzed reaction in pure water under the same reaction conditions.

However. little has been reported on their encapsulation into polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers to improve their biomedical applications. Generation four (G4) PAMAM dendrimer containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid core with acrylic acid and ethylenediamine as repeating units was synthesized by divergent approach and used to encapsulate a flavonoid tetramethylscutellarein (TMScu. 1) to study its solubility and in vitro release for potential bioactivity enhancement. The as-synthesized dendrimer and the dendrimer–TMScu complex were characterized by spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques. The encapsulation of 1 into dendrimer was achieved by a co-precipitation method with the encapsulation efficiency of 77.8%±0.69% and a loading capacity of 6.2%±0.06%. A phase solubility diagram indicated an increased water solubility of 1 as a function of dendrimer concentration at pH 4.0 and 7.2. In vitro release of 1 from its dendrimer complex indicated high percentage release at pH 4.0. The stability study of the TMScu-dendrimer at 0. 27 and 40 C showed the formulations to be stable when stored in cool and dark conditions compared to those stored in light and warmer temperatures. Overall. PAMAM dendrimer-G4 is capable of encapsulating 1. increasing its solubility and thus could enhance its bioactivity.

Following the beneficiation. the nonkaolinite fraction decreased from 39.58% to 0.36% whereas the kaolinite fraction increased from 60.42% to 99.64%. The X-ray diffractions showed that kaolinite was a major phase with FCC Bravais crystal lattice with particle sizes ranging between 14.6 nm and 92.5 nm. The particle size varied with intercalation ratios with methanol intercalated kaolinite > DMSO-kaolinite > urea-kaolinite (KPDMU). Following intercalation. SEM analysis revealed a change of order from thick compact overlapping euhedral pseudohexagonal platelets to irregular booklets which later transformed to vermiform morphology and dispersed euhedral pseudohexagonal platelets. Besides. dispersed euhedral pseudohexagonal platelets were seen to coexist with blocky-vermicular booklets.

Small gold particles of average diameter ≤ 4.7 nm had higher activities (on a mass basis) than medium-sized (14.7 nm) particles and were at least twice as active as catalysts containing large (≥ 43 nm) gold particles. The small gold particles were also activated at lower potentials. resulting in lower onset potentials for glycerol oxidation. On the other hand. large gold particles had much higher onset potentials and were less stable during glycerol oxidation. While small gold particles were more active on a mass basis (primarily due to surface area effects). it was found that the specific activity (per unit real surface area) increased with increasing gold particle size.

In this investigation. the effect of adding MnO2 to a gold-based catalyst system was explored for the glycerol electrooxidation reaction. It was found that modification of the carbon support with MnO2 had the effect of stabilising gold nanoparticles. giving rise to smaller gold particles with a more uniform particle size distribution than on the carbon alone. All gold-based catalysts gave very high currents for glycerol oxidation (1–5 A mg−1 cat) and catalysts with MnO2 contents of 5 and 9 wt% yielded the highest mass activities (35–37 A mg−1 Au). This is believed to be partly due to MnO2 preventing gold agglomeration. creating a larger gold surface area for reaction.

Here. we studied the effect of the hypoxia-activated synthetic quinoxaline di-N-oxide DCQ against breast cancer metastasis and identified the underlying mechanisms. The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (p53 wildtype) and MDA-MB-231 (p53 mutant) were treated with DCQ under normoxia or hypoxia. Drug toxicity on non-cancerous MCF-10A breast cells was also determined. In vitro cellular responses were investigated by flow cytometry. transfection. western blotting. ELISA and migration assays. The anti-metastatic effect of DCQ was validated in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model. DCQ selectively induced apoptosis in both human breast cancer cells preferentially under hypoxia without affecting the viability of non-cancerous MCF-10A. Cancer cell death was associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) independently of p53 and was inhibited by antioxidants. DCQ-induced ROS was associated with DNA damage. the downregulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α). and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. In MCF-7. HIF-1α inhibition was partially via p53-activation and was accompanied by a decrease in p-mTOR protein. suggesting interference with HIF-1α translation. In MDA-MB-231. DCQ reduced HIF-1α through proteasomal-dependent degradation mechanisms. HIF-1α inhibition by DCQ blocked VEGF secretion and invasion in MCF-7 and led to the inhibition of TWIST in MDA-MB-231.

1133716,Quinoxaline 1. 4-dioxides induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human colon cancer cells.,2005,Hala U Gali-Muhtasib and Mona Diab-Assaf and Makhluf J Haddadin,55,Cancer Chemotherapy & Pharmacology,4,,,We have recently shown that quinoxaline 1. 4-dioxide (QdNO) derivatives. namely 2-benzoyl-3-phenyl-6. 7-dichloroquinoxaline 1. 4-dioxide (DCQ). 2-benzoyl-3-phenyl-quinoxaline 1. 4-dioxide (BPQ) and 2-acetyl-3-methyl-quinoxaline 1. 4-dioxide (AMQ). suppress the growth of T-84 human colon cancer cells. Here we show that the growth-suppressive effects of QdNOs are due to their ability to induce cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. While AMQ blocked more than 60% of cells at the G2/M phase without inducing apoptosis. DCQ caused a significant increase in apoptotic cells with no noticeable effects on the cycling of cells. Treatment with BPQ resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. With regard to the effects of QdNOs on molecules that regulate apoptosis and the G2 to M transition. both BPQ and AMQ inhibited the expression of cyclin B. while DCQ significantly decreased the levels of Bcl-2 and increased Bax expression. Next. we investigated whether transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-b1) and/or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mediate the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of QdNOs in colon cancer cells. Interestingly. the above QdNOs increased differentially total TGFb1 mRNA expression and decreased TGFa mRNA and ERK phosphorylation. None of these QdNOs induced changes in TGFb-2 mRNA expression. The addition of a specific inhibitor of MEK greatly enhanced apoptosis in cells treated with DCQ. suggesting that the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation may explain. to an extent. the apoptogenic effects of this compound.

This new cigarette has virtually the same blend composition as the 1R4F cigarette. However. the 1R4F cigarette was made in 1983 and the variation in the tobacco from crop year to crop year as well as the difference in the age of the two cigarettes were expected to generate differences in the smoke chemistry. A study done for the quantitation of more than 44 analytes in smoke. including most compounds considered as biologically active. is presented in this report. The analyses were performed by six independent laboratories using a variety of analytical techniques. The smoking was performed using International Standard (ISO) recommendations. The results showed only small differences between the two cigarettes regarding ‘tar'. nicotine and carbon monoxide (CO). as well as for aminonaphthalenes. resorcinol. and some aldehydes. Although the two reference cigarettes were made as close as possible. the concentrations of a significant number of analytes in the smoke differed between 10% to 30%. Specific trace compounds in the blend such as metals and tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNA). which may influence the smoke composition. were also different between the two cigarettes.

This is particularly true for instruments requiring a high degree of aerosol dilution. This was illustrated in a previous study. where average particle diameters in the 10-50 nm range were determined by a high-dilution. electrical mobility method. Total particulate matter (TPM) masses calculated based on those diameters were orders of magnitude smaller than gravimetrically determined TPM. This discrepancy was believed to result from almost complete particle evaporation at the dilution levels of the electrical mobility analysis. The same study described a spectral transmission measurement of e-cigarette particle size in an undiluted state. and reported particles from 210-380 nm count median diameter. Observed particle number concentrations were in the 109 particles/cm3 range. Additional particle size measurements described here also found e-cigarette particle size to be in the 260-320 nm count median diameter range. Cambridge filter pads have been used for decades to determine TPM yields of tobacco burning cigarettes. and collection of e-cigarette TPM by fibrous filters is predicted to be a highly efficient process over a wide range of filtration flow rates. The results presented in this work provide support for this hypothesis.Described here is a study in which e-cigarette aerosols were collected on Cambridge filters with adsorbent traps placed downstream in an effort to capture any material passing through the filter.

The heavier molecules are less retained. but even compounds such as indeno[1.2.3-cd]pyrene. dibenz[a. h]anthracene. and benzoperylene are retained with efficiencies around 50%. The dependence of retention efficiency for PAHs (in %) on their octanol-water partition coefficient (LogPow) was found to be nonlinear and showed considerable variability for several compounds that have very close LogPow values. Better correlation was obtained between the retention efficiency and PAHs vapor pressure (Log VP).,True,qD2AcWMAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC,30,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/cttr/23/2/article-p85.xml,14769755451237973338,/scholar?cites=14769755451237973338,,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/cttr/23/2/article-p85.pdf,0,0,0
1133743,Analysis of pyridines in mainstream cigarette smoke,2003,NP Kulshreshtha and SC Moldoveanu,985,Journal of Chromatography A,1-2,303-312,Elsevier,A new technique has been developed for the quantitative analysis of pyridines in mainstream cigarette smoke using a GC–MS technique. For analysis. 10 cigarettes are smoked using conditions based on US Federal Trade Commission recommendations. The smoke is collected in a water trap and analyzed using a GC–MS technique. A standard or a fast GC separation can be applied for the analysis. The standard separation was followed by MS detection using selected ion monitoring (SIM) acquisition on a quadrupole instrument. The fast GC was followed by MS detection with total ion acquisition on a time-of-flight instrument. The levels of pyridine depend on the type of cigarette: for a full flavor cigarette pyridine is as high as 18.0 μg/cigarette (cig.). and for an ultra light cigarette is about 3.0 μg/cig. Substituted pyridines vary between 5.0 μg/cig. to 0.1 μg/cig. for a full flavor cigarette. and between 0.2 μg/cig. and a few …,True,qD2AcWMAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,30,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967302014723,12629556559941042730,/scholar?cites=12629556559941042730,,,0,0,0

The cigarettes analyzed in the study were Kentucky reference cigarettes 1R4F and 2R4F. and five other cigarettes. three of them having tobaccos with low levels of tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). All cigarettes had ‘tar’ levels around 10 mg [where ‘tar’ is defined as the weight of total wet particulate matter (TPM) minus the weight of nicotine and water]. Cigarettes were smoked according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) puffing regimen. using a 35 mL puff volume. 2 sec puff duration and 60 sec puff intervals. Three separate experiments were performed in this study to evaluate the proportion of TSNAs transferred from preexistent tobacco TSNAs and the proportion formed during smoking (pyrosynthesized). In one experiment. the results were obtained by GC/MS analysis of 13C3-TSNAs formed in smoke when 13C3-nicotine was intentionally added to cigarettes. Another experiment used GC analysis with chemiluminescence detection of TSNAs from smoke before and after an excess of nornicotine was intentionally added to cigarettes. and another experiment consisted of LC/MS/MS analysis of 2H4-TSNAs formed in the smoke when 2H4-nicotine and when 2H4-nornicotine were intentionally added to cigarettes.

1133847,Decavanadate toxicology and pharmacological activities: V10 or V1. both or none?,2016,M Aureliano,2016,,,,Hindawi,This review covers recent advances in the understanding of decavanadate toxicology and pharmacological applications. Toxicological in vivo studies point out that V10 induces several changes in several oxidative stress parameters. different from the ones observed for vanadate (V1). In in vitro studies with mitochondria. a particularly potent V10 effect. in comparison with V1. was observed in the mitochondrial depolarization (IC50 = 40 nM) and oxygen consumption (99 nM). It is suggested that mitochondrial membrane depolarization is a key event in decavanadate induction of necrotic cardiomyocytes death. Furthermore. only decavanadate species and not V1 potently inhibited myosin ATPase activity stimulated by actin (IC50 = 0.75 μM) whereas exhibiting lower inhibition activities for Ca2+-ATPase activity (15 μM) and actin polymerization (17 μM). Because both calcium pump and actin decavanadate interactions lead to its stabilization. it is likely that V10 interacts at specific locations with these proteins that protect against hydrolysis but. on the other hand. it may induce V10 reduction to oxidovanadium(IV).

Fe. Co) and/or different porphyrin ligands (TMPyP. TTAPP) have been supported on aluminated mesoporous silica of the MMS (HMS) type by means of cation exchange. The porphyrin species are firmly bound to the solid matrix. Their catalytic properties in the oxidation of cyclohexene with iodosobenzene depend primarily on the nature of the metal centre. Mn and Fe porphyrins are active in converting cyclohexene to allylic oxidation products. while Co porphyrin is inactive. Preferential formation of allylic compounds (100% selectivity for Mn porphyrins and 80% for Fe porphyrin) is associated with the location of porphyrin centres at the inner pore walls where steric hindrances prohibit formation of epoxide. Appearance of a small amount of epoxide in the case of supported Fe(TMPyP) is attributed to the presence of a certain amount of porphyrin …,True,pOCWqBAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,108,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926860X04006313,7868740054070547662,/scholar?cites=7868740054070547662,,,0,0,0

The results show that VIVO occupies two types of binding sites in albumin. which compete not only with each other. but also with hydrolysis of the metal ion. In one of the sites the resulting VIVO–HSA complex has a weak visible CD signal and its X-band EPR spectrum may be easily measured. This was assigned to amino acid side chains of the ATCUN site. The other binding site shows stronger signals in the CD in the visible range. but has a hardly …,True,-rM1g6YAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,61,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2012/dt/c2dt12193j,2458100129685339304,/scholar?cites=2458100129685339304,,,0,0,0

Although some promising results have been already reported for 111In complexes that contain bioactive peptides.[3. 4] the therapeutic potential of Auger emitter radiometals has not yet been fully demonstrated in the clinical arena. Due to the short range of Auger electrons. there is a need for preferential accumulation of the complexes into the nucleus of neoplastic cells in order to elicit significant DNA damage. and therefore a therapeutic effect. The achievement of this goal lies in the design of multifunctional complexes that include a DNA-binding moiety. a carrier to transport the complex into the nucleus. and/or a tumour-seeking vector.[4–6] The presence of the later should provide a specific recognition of the neoplastic cells and promote the internalisation of the complexes. while the DNA-binding moiety is expected to augment the stacking into DNA. and consequently to enhance the radiotoxicity of the Auger emitter.

However. the atomic-level recognition mechanisms of methylated histones by their respective adaptor proteins are still elusive. For instance. it is unclear how L3MBTL1. a methyl-lysine histone code reader. recognizes equally well both mono- and dimethyl marks but ignores unmodified and trimethylated lysine residues. We made use of molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy perturbation (FEP) techniques in order to investigate the energetics and dynamics of the methyl-lysine recognition. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed to experimentally validate the computational findings.

Here we explored whether target-class focused DNA-encoded chemical libraries can be cost-effective tools to achieve robust screening productivity for a series of proteins. The study revealed that a DNA-encoded library designed for NAD+-binding pockets (NADEL) effectively sampled the chemical binder space of enzymes with ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. The extracted information directed the synthesis of inhibitors for several enzymes including PARP15 and SIRT6. The high dissimilarity of NADEL screening fingerprints for different proteins translated into inhibitors that showed selectivity for their target.

A remarkably stronger change in basicity can be observed in the amines in comparison with the phosphanes when alkyl groups are replaced by aryl groups.

Luminescent RuII complexes based on π-accepting ligands were designed to allow a photoreactivity towards biomolecules. thanks to their important photo-oxidizing power. It was clearly demonstrated that this photoreactivity originates from a primary photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process from either a guanine moiety (G) or a tryptophan residue (Trp) to the excited complex. One of the consequences of this PET process is the formation of a photoadduct between the RuII complex and the G or Trp moieties of a biomolecule. In those photoadducts a covalent bond is formed linking the biomolecule to one ligand of the complex without destruction of the chelation sphere …,True,ycNyi68AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,50,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010854512000367,2483956969701974277,/scholar?cites=2483956969701974277,,https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/136380/1/TAP116.pdf,0,0,0

On binding to DNA the excited states of certain complexes show reduced non-radiative decay and protection from oxygen or water. while in other cases the excited state is quenched because of electron transfer from the nucleobases. Examples of photochemical induction of strand breaks. light-induced photooxidative damage and the formation of covalent photoadducts between metal complexes and nucleobases are discussed.

This is particularly striking with the G‐rich telomeric sequence d(T2AG3)4. Complex 1. which interacts strongly with the ODNs as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and emission anisotropy experiments. gives rise under illumination to the formation of covalent adducts with the G units of the ODNs.

This photoadduct formation leads to photocrosslinking of the two strands. The percentage quenching of luminescence of the complex by electron transfer was compared to the resulting yield of photocrosslinked product. This yield does not only depend on the ionisation potential of the guanine bases. which are electron donors. but also on other factors. such as the position of the guanine bases as compared to the site of attachment of the complex. The photocrosslinking yield is higher when the guanine moieties are towards the 3о end on the complementary strand as compared to the tethering site.

UV-melting experiments. and molecular mechanics calculations. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were analyzed by means of 2-dimensional NMR experiments. J-Coupling analysis of the 1D and 2D 1H and 13C spectra was used to determine the conformation of the ring systems in the molecule. It appeared that at low temperature (283 K) the deoxyribose sugars adopt a N-type conformation. The geometry is best described by an intermediate between the 3 (2) T and 3E forms. In addition. we were able to derive all other torsion angles in the phosphate backbone ring system. ie. alpha+. beta t. gamma+. delta (= 89 degrees). epsilon t. and zeta+. When the molecule is subjected to an energy minimization procedure (using the program AMBER). the sugar ring system retains. practically speaking. the torsion angles found from the NMR experiments. while the torsion angles around the glycosidic bond adopt a value of 175 degrees in the minimum energy conformation. UV-melting experiments indicate that two molecules can form a dimer in which the adenine bases are intercalated. The feasibility of this structure is indicated by molecular mechanics calculations. At higher temperatures the dimer is converted into separate monomers. In the monomer form the sugars exhibit S-pucker 20% of the time.

The ultraviolet absorption of the solutions changes during reaction by forming an enediol intermediate. which slowly converts into HMF. Pseudo first order rate coefficients were used for comparing reactivity of sugars in model systems and in fortified juices. Glucose degrades much more slowly than fructose. while the reactivity of sucrose depends on pH value and temperature. The activation energy for sucrose was about 20 kcal mol‐1 higher than fructose. and such a difference can be ascribed to the rate‐determining contribution of the preliminary hydrolysis step.

It is based on the adsorption of dilute extracts of hesperidin on a styrene−divinylbenzene (SDVB) resin and the desorption in much more reduced volumes by means of alkaline eluents. Hesperidin immediately precipitates with good yield and high purity after acidification of the concentrated solutions. thus overcoming disadvantages due to the high dilution. Different experiments were carried out to examine operating conditions in each phase of the process. Hesperidin was extracted from peel with an aqueous saturated Ca(OH)2 solution. allowing precipitation of calcium pectates from colloidal pectins that can interfere in the subsequent phases of adsorption and separation of hesperidin.

The total polyphenol levels in pistachios. measured as mg of Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE). were: 201±10.1. 349±18.3 and 184.7±6.2 mg GAE/100 g DM in unripe. ripe and dried ripe samples. respectively. Most phenolics in ripe pistachios were found to be anthocyanins. They increased with ripening. while the sun drying process caused a susbtantial loss. Flavonoids found in all pistachio samples were daidzein. genistein. daidzin. quercetin. eriodictyol. luteolin. genistin and naringenin. which decreased both with ripening and drying. Before the drying process both unripe and ripe pistachios showed a higher content of trans-resveratrol than dried ripe samples. γ-Tocopherol was the major vitamin E isomer found in pistachios. The total content (of α-and γ-tocopherols) decreased. both during ripening and during the drying process. These results suggested that unpeeled pistachios can be considered an important source of phenolics. particularly of anthocyanins.

The IP V was calculated using MP2. CBS-QB3. and Koopmans’ theory. while the IP A was calculated with B3LYP. CAM-B3LYP. ψB97XD. B2PLYP. and MP2 using the ΔE method for the ground state B3LYP optimized geometries. IP A s of RDX and TNT were also calculated using CBS-QB3 with relaxed geometries of the ions. Of the methods tested. B3LYP and B2PLYPD provided superior and more consistent results for calculating the IP compared to CBS-QB3 level IP A calculations and experimental data (where available). CBS-QB3 was used as a benchmark for calculating the EA V as experimental data has not been reported. For calculations of the EA V. B3LYP performed the worst while MP2 and B2PLYPD predicted values closest to those made by CBS-QB3. Basis set effects were evaluated using 6-31+ G (d. p). 6-311+ G (d. p). and 6-311+ G (3df. 2p) for both IP and EA. 6-31+ G (d. p) gave satisfactory results for calculating IP while 6-311+ G (3df. 2p) had improved results for calculating the EA. The four nitro-containing compounds have exothermic reduction potentials while the peroxides are endothermic. In addition. it was determined that RDX. HMX.

Complementary X-ray spectroscopic methods are used to reveal that the valence band maximum consists of O 2p states. while the conduction band minimum is primarily composed of Cu 3d states. Therefore. γ-Cu3V2O8 is classified as a charge transfer insulator. in which the 1.80 eV indirect band gap corresponds to the O 2p → Cu 3d transition. Through photoelectrochemical measurements. the surface of γ-Cu3V2O8 photoanodes is found to display intrinsic activity for catalyzing water oxidation that is stable with time.

The sensing film was produced by screen printing and spray coating of the sensing material on interdigitated silver electrodes inkjet-printed on a paper substrate. The H2S sensing functionality with respect to pH and metal salt concentration was optimized. In addition. the long term stability and humidity effects on the sensor performance were investigated. The printed chemiresistors showed more than five orders of magnitude change in resistance within 20 min of exposure of 15 ppm H2S at room temperature. The relatively fast kinetics and large response of the sensor can be explained by the formation of Cu2S and subsequent protonation of PANI.

Recent measurements using mRNA-based assays have raised doubts. however. as to the importance of ASNS protein in the cellular mechanisms that confer drug resistance upon the leukemic cells. Studies aimed at determining the concentration of ASNS protein in human leukemias are therefore needed to resolve this issue. A mass spectrometry (MS)-based procedure is presented for the direct quantification of ASNS protein concentration in complex sample mixtures. This assay is able to distinguish samples from transformed cell lines that express ASNS over a wide dynamic range of concentration. Importantly. this method directly detects ASNS protein. the functional entity that may be synthesizing sufficient asparagine to render …,True,Sb4ihBgAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391907002515,15029020660017481613,/scholar?cites=15029020660017481613,,,0,0,0

An important objective of SRM is to obtain peptide quantifications that are (1) suitable for the investigation. and (2) reproducible across laboratories and runs. The first objective is achieved by system suitability tests (SST). which verify that mass spectrometric instrumentation performs as specified. The second objective is achieved by quality control (QC). which provides in-process quality assurance of the sample profile. A common aspect of SST and QC is the longitudinal nature of the data.

Among many assay characteristics. the limit of blank (LOB) and limit of detection (LOD) are two particularly useful figures of merit. LOB and LOD are determined by repeatedly quantifying the observed intensities of peptides in samples with known peptide concentrations and deriving an intensity versus concentration response curve. Most commonly. a weighted linear or logistic curve is fit to the intensity-concentration response. and LOB and LOD are estimated from the fit. Here we argue that these methods inaccurately characterize assays where observed intensities level off at low concentrations. which is a common situation in multiplexed systems.

Increases in the percentage of sperm exhibiting aberrant sperm head morphologies have been correlated with male infertility. and biochemical studies of pooled sperm have suggested that sperm with abnormal shape may contain DNA that has not been properly repackaged by protamine during spermatid development.

One of the promising technologies is the conversion of these feedstocks to methanol by syngas synthesis [1] and subsequent synthesis of light olefins and gasoline-range hydrocarbons by the methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) process by using Brønsted acid zeolites.[2] Since the MTH was discovered by serendipity in 1976–77.[3] intensive research has yielded many advances in the understanding of the reaction mechanism and related catalyst deactivation. In H-ZSM-5 and HSAPO-34. two of the archetypal MTH catalysts. the reaction is believed to occur through the hydrocarbon pool mechanism. in which polymethyl-substituted benzene molecules are the active species.[4] These methylated benzene species produce olefins by splitting off alkyl groups. The chemistry involved in the reaction mechanism is under intensive study by theoretical [5] and experimental analytical approaches ranging isotopic labeling.[6] chromatography.[7] mass spectrometry.[8] and several spectroscopic [4c. 9] methods. Another important aspect in the MTH chemistry is to understand the mechanism and kinetics involved during the deactivation of the zeolite catalyst.

Emissions. chemistry. deposition. and meteorology are self-consistent between the global and nested domains. Compared to the global model (4° latitude by 5° longitude). the nested model shows improved skill at capturing the high spatial and temporal variability of Hg wet deposition over North America observed by the Mercury Deposition Network (MDN) in 2008–2009. The nested simulation resolves features such as higher deposition due to orographic precipitation. land/ocean contrast and and predicts more efficient convective rain scavenging of Hg over the southeast United States. However. the nested model overestimates Hg wet deposition over the Ohio River Valley region (ORV) by 27%. We modify anthropogenic emission speciation profiles in the US EPA National Emission Inventory (NEI) to account for the rapid in-plume reduction of reactive to elemental Hg (IPR simulation). This leads to a decrease in the model bias to −2.3% over the ORV region. Over the contiguous US. the correlation coefficient (r) between MDN observations and our IPR simulation increases from 0.60 to 0.78. The IPR nested simulation generally reproduces the seasonal cycle in surface concentrations of speciated Hg from the Atmospheric Mercury Network (AMNet) and Canadian Atmospheric Mercury Network (CAMNet).

We use Bayesian inversion methods combining simulations with GEOS-Chem and ground-based Hg0 observations from regional monitoring networks and individual sites in recent years. Using optimized emissions/parameters. GEOS-Chem better reproduces these ground-based observations and also matches regional over-water Hg0 and wet deposition measurements. The optimized global mercury emission to the atmosphere is ~ 5.8 Gg yr−1. The ocean accounts for 3.2 Gg yr−1 (55 % of the total). and the terrestrial ecosystem is neither a net source nor a net sink of Hg0. The optimized Asian anthropogenic emission of Hg0 (gas elemental mercury) is 650–1770 Mg yr−1. higher than its bottom-up estimates (550–800 Mg yr−1). The ocean parameter inversions suggest that dark oxidation of aqueous elemental mercury is faster. and less mercury is removed from the mixed layer through particle sinking. when compared with current simulations. Parameter changes affect the simulated global ocean mercury budget. particularly mass exchange between the mixed layer and subsurface waters. Based on our inversion results. we re-evaluate the long-term global biogeochemical cycle of mercury. and show that legacy mercury becomes more likely to reside in the terrestrial ecosystem than in the ocean.

At three of these sites. located near Ft. Lauderdale (DVE). Pensacola (OLF). and Tampa Bay (TPA). passive samplers for the measurement of air Hg concentrations and surrogate surfaces for measurement of Hg dry deposition were deployed. While it is known that Hg in wet deposition in Florida is high compared to the rest of the United States. there is little information on Hg dry deposition. The objectives of the work were to: (1) investigate the utility of passive sampling systems for Hg in an area with low and consistent air concentrations as measured by the Tekran® mercury measurement system. (2) estimate dry deposition of gaseous oxidized Hg. and (3) investigate potential sources. This paper focuses on Objective 3. All sites were situated within 15 km of 1000 MW electricity generating plants (EGPs) and major highways.

1134342,An updated review of atmospheric mercury,2020,Seth N Lyman and Irene Cheng and Lynne E Gratz and Peter Weiss-Penzias and Leiming Zhang,707,,,135575,Elsevier,The atmosphere is a key component of the biogeochemical cycle of mercury. acting as a reservoir. transport mechanism. and facilitator of chemical reactions. The chemical and physical behavior of atmospheric mercury determines how. when. and where emitted mercury pollution impacts ecosystems. In this review. we provide current information about what is known and what remains uncertain regarding mercury in the atmosphere. We discuss new ambient. laboratory. and theoretical information about the chemistry of mercury in various atmospheric media. We review what is known about mercury in and on solid- and liquid-phase aerosols. We present recent findings related to wet and dry deposition and spatial and temporal trends in atmospheric mercury concentrations. We also review atmospheric measurement methods that are in wide use and those that are currently under development.,True,MLrdmLcAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,30,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719355706,2205926189054210339,/scholar?cites=2205926189054210339,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Weiss7/publication/337407286_An_updated_review_of_atmospheric_mercury/links/5dddb4bc4585159aa44b8e67/An-updated-review-of-atmospheric-mercury.pdf,0,0,0
