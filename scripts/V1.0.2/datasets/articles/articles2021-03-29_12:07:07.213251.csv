1266312,An investigation of thermal stratification in HCCI engines using chemiluminescence imaging,2006,John E Dec and Wontae Hwang and Magnus Sjöberg,,SAE Transactions,,759-776,SAE International,Chemiluminescence imaging has been applied to investigate the naturally occurring charge stratification in an HCCI engine. This stratification slows the pressure-rise rate (PRR) during combustion. making it critical to the high-load operating limit of these engines. Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder HCCI engine modified with windows in the combustion chamber for optical access. Using this engine. chemiluminescence images were obtained from three different view angles. These included both single-shot images with intensified CCD cameras and high-speed (20kHz) sequences with an intensified CMOS video camera. The engine was fueled with iso-octane. which has been shown to be a reasonable surrogate for gasoline and exhibits only single-stage ignition at these naturally aspirated conditions. The chemiluminescence images show that the HCCI combustion is not homogeneous but has a …,True,hyCYSksAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,225,https://www.jstor.org/stable/44687346,8312463153857594253,/scholar?cites=8312463153857594253,,,,0,0,0
1266313,Spectroscopic and chemical-kinetic analysis of the phases of HCCI autoignition and combustion for single-and two-stage ignition fuels,2008,Wontae Hwang and John Dec and Magnus Sjöberg,154,Combustion and Flame,3,387-409,Elsevier,The temporal phases of autoignition and combustion in an HCCI engine have been investigated in both an all-metal engine and a matching optical engine. Gasoline. a primary reference fuel mixture (PRF80). and several representative real-fuel constituents were examined. Only PRF80. which is a two-stage ignition fuel. exhibited a “cool-flame” low-temperature heat-release (LTHR) phase. For all fuels. slow exothermic reactions occurring at intermediate temperatures raised the charge temperature to the hot-ignition point. In addition to the amount of LTHR. differences in this intermediate-temperature heat-release (ITHR) phase affect the fuel ignition quality. Chemiluminescence images of iso-octane show a weak and uniform light emission during this phase. This is followed by the main high-temperature heat-release (HTHR) phase. Finally. a “burnout” phase was observed. with very weak uniform emission and near …,True,hyCYSksAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,170,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010218008000977,8516188113490667060,/scholar?cites=8516188113490667060,,,,0,0,0

1266316,Thermodynamic and chemical effects of EGR and its constituents on HCCI autoignition,2007,Magnus Sjöberg and John E Dec and Wontae Hwang,,SAE Transactions,,271-289,SAE International,EGR can be used beneficially to control combustion phasing in HCCI engines. To better understand the function of EGR. this study experimentally investigates the thermodynamic and chemical effects of real EGR. simulated EGR. dry EGR. and individual EGR constituents (N₂. CO₂. and H₂O) on the autoignition processes. This was done for gasoline and various PRF blends. The data show that addition of real EGR retards the autoignition timing for all fuels. However. the amount of retard is dependent on the specific fuel type. This can be explained by identifying and quantifying the various underlying mechanisms. which are: 1) Thermodynamic cooling effect due to increased specific-heat capacity. 2) [O₂] reduction effect. 3) Enhancement of autoignition due to the presence of H₂O. 4) Enhancement or suppression of autoignition due to the presence of trace species such as unburned or partially-oxidized …,True,hyCYSksAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,143,https://www.jstor.org/stable/44699278,8111183587800601473,/scholar?cites=8111183587800601473,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1266152,0,0,0

Stationary turbulence (at Taylor micro-scale Reynolds number of 230) with small mean flow was created in a nearly spherical sealed chamber by means of eight synthetic jet actuators. Two-dimensional particle image velocimetry was used to measure global turbulence statistics in the presence of spherical glass particles that had a diameter of 165$\umu $ m. which was similar to the Kolmogorov length scale of the flow. Experiments were conducted at two different turbulence levels and particle mass loadings up to 0.3. The particles attenuated the fluid turbulence kinetic energy and viscous dissipation rate with increasing mass loadings.

1266318,Characterizing the development of thermal stratification in an HCCI engine using planar-imaging thermometry,2009,John E Dec and Wontae Hwang,2,SAE International Journal of Engines,1,421-438,SAE International,A planar temperature imaging diagnostic has been developed and applied to an investigation of naturally occurring thermal stratification in an HCCI engine. Natural thermal stratification is critical for high-load HCCI operation because it slows the combustion heat release; however. little is known about its development or distribution. A tracer-based single-line PLIF imaging technique was selected for its good precision and simplicity. Temperature-map images were derived from the PLIF images. based on the temperature sensitivity of the fluorescence signal of the toluene tracer added to the fuel. A well premixed intake charge assured that variations in fuel/air mixture did not affect the signal. Measurements were made in a single-cylinder optically accessible HCCI research engine (displacement = 0.98 liters) at a typical 1200 rpm operating condition.

Several stratification techniques were examined: different GDI injectors. increased swirl. and changes in injection pressure. to determine which parameters are effective for improving the combustion efficiency while maintaining NOX emissions below U.S. 2010 limits. Performance and emission measurements were obtained in an all-metal engine. Corresponding fuel distribution measurements were made with fuel PLIF imaging in a matching optically accessible engine. The fuel used was iso-octane. which is a good surrogate for gasoline. For an idle fueling rate (ϕ = 0.12). combustion efficiency was improved substantially. from 64% to 89% at the NOX limit. using delayed fuel injection with a hollow-cone injector at an injection pressure of 120 bar.

1266321,Isolating the Effects of EGR on HCCI Heat-Release Rates and NOₓ Emissions,2010,John E Dec and Magnus Sjöberg and Wontae Hwang,2,SAE International Journal of Engines,2,58-70,SAE International,High-load HCCI operation is typically limited by rapid pressure-rise rates (PRR) and engine knock caused by an overly rapid heat-release rate (HRR). Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is commonly used in HCCI engines. and it is often stated in the literature that charge dilution with EGR (or high levels of retained residuals) is beneficial for reducing the PRR to allow higher loads without knock. However. EGR/retained-residuals affect other operating parameters such as combustion phasing. which can in turn influence the PRR independently from any effect of the EGR gases themselves. Because of the multiple effects of EGR. its direct benefit for reducing the PRR is not well understood.In this work. the effects of EGR on the PRR were isolated by controlling the combustion phasing independently from the EGR addition by adjusting the intake temperature.

The interrogation window size should be kept small to reduce bias error and improve spatial resolution. A spatial filter is then applied to the velocity field to reduce random error and clarify flow structure. The performance of three popular spatial filters were assessed: box filter. median filter. and local quadratic polynomial regression filter. In order to quantify random uncertainty. the image matching (IM) method is applied to an experimental dataset of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (HIT) obtained by 2D-PIV.

1266336,Turbulence Attenuation By Particles in Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence,2002,Wontae Hwang and John Eaton,55,APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting Abstracts,,KB. 003,,Many simulations and experiments have been conducted to investigate the phenomenon of turbulence attenuation in particle-laden flows. but the underlying physical mechanisms are still not well known. We have developed a unique apparatus to study the interaction of particles in a very simple turbulent flow. Homogeneous and isotropic turbulence is created by synthetic jet actuators mounted on the corners of a box. Measurements from 2D PIV indicate that RMS velocities are on the order of 1 m/s. while mean velocities are less than 10unity. indicating a good degree of isotropy. Results of natural decaying turbulence confirm a typical power law decay in time. Particles were added and a nearly stationary dispersion was created by free-floating the apparatus in a micro-gravity environment.

Therefore. understanding the flow interaction between multiple synthetic jets is crucial in maximizing the potential for many industrial applications. In the present study. an experimental investigation on flow interaction between two synthetic jets generated from a dual-orifice device is performed.

Remarkably. the strong phonon-scattering effect generated by the enormous interfaces between the three networks yields an ultra-low solid thermal conductivity of ∼8 mW m−1 K−1.

Its excellent ZT is largely attributed to the nanoscale coherent interface that promotes phonon scattering while having minimal effect on electron transport. Despite the experimental work on LAST material synthesis and characterization. very little knowledge is known about the nanoscale coherent interface and its effect on energy transport. In this work. we report on the first atomic observation of coherent nanointerface in a PbTe/GeTe nanocomposite and quantitative characterization of the local chemical composition and crystalline structure based on atomistic modeling. The structure coherency is confirmed with atom position imaging. atom number density distribution. and line and point coherency functions.

To understand their physico-chemical operating mechanisms. we performed in operando synchrotron X-ray transmission nanoscale spectromicroscopy using an ultra-sensitive time-multiplexed technique. We observed only spatially uniform material changes during cell operation. in sharp contrast to the frequently detected formation of a localized conduction channel in transition-metal–oxide memristors.

One example is a hybrid optical-thermal antenna with sub-wavelength light focusing. which simultaneously enables intensity enhancement at the operating wavelength in the visible and reduction of the operating temperature. The enhancement is achieved via light recycling in the form of whispering-gallery modes trapped in an optical microcavity. while cooling functionality is realized via a combination of reduced optical absorption and radiative cooling.

We find noticeable differences in the spectra of layers with different porosity. as expected from the quantum confinement of electrons and phonons in silicon nanocrystals with different average sizes. The PL emission band gets stronger. blue shifts. and narrows at the high porosity layers. The average size can be estimated from the shift. The Raman phonon band at 520 cm-1 weakens and broadens asymmetrically towards the low energy side. The line shape can be related quantitatively with the average size by the phonon confinement model.

The corresponding Al/PS/Si structures show a rectifying behavior. even after prolonged times in contact to the atmosphere. The series resistance and the ideality factor as a function of time of storage in ambient air have been determined by employing a variation of the Norde method. We have also studied the influence of the electrolytic formation parameters in the process of aging of the Al/PS/Si structures. The results show that longer anodization times and higher formation current densities of the PS layer lead to a faster diminution of the current flowing through the Al/PS/Si structure as a result of its exposition to the atmosphere.

However it has been shown that the line shape obtained on top surface experiments depends on the excitation wavelength. Because the porosity depends on depth. previous results are masked by the change in penetration depth. In this communication we report depth-resolved micro-Raman spectra at 514.5 and 632.8 nm. The spectra were measured at different points along a cross section of porous silicon films. We show that even when the same layer and. therefore. the same porosity is probed the Raman peak is broader at shorter wavelengths.

Porous silicon multilayer stacks (PSMS) can exhibit a strong modulation of light so they can replace other dielectric layers in interference filters or mirrors [3]. PSMS can be formed essentially in two different ways [4]:(i) by a periodic variation of the etch parameters. such as the current density or the light intensity. during the electrochemical process. or (ii) by the use of periodically doped substrates. while keeping the etch parameters constant.In previous TEM-related works. the PSMS were formed in the dark [3±5]. In the present work. PSMS have been produced by a periodic variation of the electrochemical formation parameters. which leads to periodic variations of the porosity. In addition. the samples were formed under a constant level of illumination which results in a well defined structure of the porous silicon layers with very high porosity. It is important to note that the electrochemical formation method employed in the present work to prepare the samples allows a total control over the number of layers. as well as a good control over the porosity and the thickness of each layer. The use of metallic backside contacts made to the silicon wafer leads to PS layers of good homogeneity and avoids changes of the local current density which induce porosity and thickness gradients [6]. The PSMS used in this work were obtained from p-type (boron-doped) silicon wafers of k1 0 0l orientation and 0.1±0.5 Ω cm resistivity.

Neanderthals habitually used fire and if they needed black material for decoration. soot and charcoal were readily available. whereas obtaining manganese oxides would have incurred considerably higher costs. Compositional analyses lead us to infer that late Neanderthals at Pech-de-l’Azé I were deliberately selecting manganese dioxide. Combustion experiments and thermo-gravimetric measurements demonstrate that manganese dioxide reduces wood’s auto-ignition temperature and substantially increases the rate of char combustion. leading us to conclude that the most beneficial use for manganese dioxide was in fire-making.

The pyrolysis of macroalgae can produce a range of chemicals and chars with various properties. A large proportion of macroalgae is carbohydrate of which the alginates are dominant. The alginates are largely present bound with a cation. which can include calcium. sodium. magnesium or potassium. The thermal behavior of alginic acid. sodium alginate and calcium alginate have been investigated using batch pyrolysis experiments and thermal analysis including TGA-FTIR and Py-GC–MS to evaluate the influence of the cation. The change in cation from Na+ to Ca2+ significantly influences the pyrolysis behavior and in the case of Na alginate leads to significant swelling of the char. not observed for the Ca alginate or alginic acid.

As such. there is a drive towards continuous-flow processing systems to aid process scale-up and eventually commercialization. The current study presents results from a novel pilot-scale HTL reactor with a feed capacity of up to 100 L/h and a process volume of approximately 20 L. The pilot plant employs a heat exchanger for heat recovery and a novel hydraulic oscillation system to increase the turbulence in the tubular reactor. The energy grass Miscanthus and the microalgae Spirulina. both representing advanced dedicated energy crops. as well as sewage sludge as high-potential waste stream were selected to assess the reactor performance. Biomass slurries with up to 16 wt% dry matter content were successfully processed. The heat recovery of the heat exchanger is found to increase with reactor run time. reaching 80% within 5–6 h of operation. The hydraulic oscillation system is shown to improve mixing and enhance heat transfer. Bio-crudes with average yields of 26 wt%. 33 wt% and 25 wt% were produced from Miscanthus. Spirulina and sewage sludge. respectively. The yields also appeared to increase with reactor run time. Bio-crude from HTL of Spirulina was mainly composed of palmitic acid. glycerol. heptadecane and linolelaidic acid. while biocrude from sewage sludge contained mainly palmitic acid. oleic acid and stearic acid. In contrast. biocrude from HTL of Miscanthus consisted of a large number of different phenolics.

1266405,The potential of the production of fuels and chemicals from marine biomass,2011,Konstantinos Anastasakis,,,,,,"The need for sustainability. energy security and reduction of global warming has brought many alternative energy sources into the foreground. Already there are well established technologies that can produce renewable energy but when it comes to the production of renewable liquid fuels and chemicals. biomass is the primary feedstock. Biomass is a renewable source of energy that can provide heat. electricity and transport fuels. However. utilisation of biomass posses some limitations such as land availability and competition of energy crops with food crops. In order to overcome these problems ""third generation"" biofuels from alternative feedstock such as macro-algae have recently come into the foreground. Oceans and seas cover over 70% of the earth's surface. most of which is under exploited. resulting in additional potential for biomass production. This thesis concentrates on the potential for production of bio-energy and chemicals from macro-algae through thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis. combustion and hydrothermal liquefaction. Utilisation of aquatic biomass for production of bioenergy is a very recent concept and there is a lack of information on their thermochemical behaviour.

Due to the wet nature of the process where biomass is heated in an aqueous slurry at 350 C and 200 bar. wet biomass and wet wastes are particularly suited for the process. The current study investigates the utilization of wastewater treatment sludges and other organic wastes for the production of sustainable petroleum replacement products. The work has been carried out on a pilot scale continuous hydrothermal liquefaction reactor with a novel oscillating flow system and heat exchanger. The influence of these are discussed in terms of heat recovery and operability of the plant. The reactor was run at 50 L/h with maximum solids loadings of~ 25% and short residence times of80% was accomplished. leading to an energy efficient process. During operation of the HTL system. approximately 5 units of energy are created in the form of bio-crude for every unit of energy invested for heating and pumping the slurry (EROI> 5).

1266415,Economics of hybrid photovoltaic power plants,2012,Christian Breyer,,,,,,The global power supply stability is faced to several severe and fundamental threats. in particular steadily increasing power demand. diminishing and degrading fossil and nuclear energy resources. very harmful greenhouse gas emissions. significant energy injustice and a structurally misbalanced ecological footprint. Photovoltaic (PV) power systems are analysed in various aspects focusing on economic and technical considerations of supplemental and substitutional power supply to the constraint conventional power system. To infer the most relevant system approach for PV power plants several solar resources available for PV systems are compared. By combining the different solar resources and respective economics. two major PV systems are identified to be very competitive in almost all regions in the world. The experience curve concept is used as a key technique for the development of scenario assumptions on economic projections for the decade of the 2010s. Main drivers for cost reductions in PV systems are learning and production growth rate. thus several relevant aspects are discussed such as research and development investments. technical PV market potential. different PV technologies and the energetic sustainability of PV.

As a part of such transition energy savings are also important. as they can decrease production costs effectively. The nature of such a change is that it has to be implemented on a local level. Energy saving technologies are placed with the demand decrease and renewable energy is typically distributed where the resources are. In some parts of the world. energy savings have resulted in a stabilisation of the energy demands. however in the world as such. demands are still increasing in buildings. transport and industry. Although the demand has increased approx. 32% overall. the share of renewable energy has increased from 12.7% in 1990 to 13% in 2010. in this way demonstrating that renewables can effectively cope with the world energy requirements–even in a context characterized by a continuously increasing demand. Even in the current financial crisis. renewable energy is expanding heavily. The most used renewable energy is biomass; however there has been a significant increase in wind power and in photovoltaic in the last ten years. Such development in the intermittent renewable energy sources requires knowledge about the interaction between supply and demand sides of energy.

1266439,CloudSpider: Combining replication with scheduling for optimizing live migration of virtual machines across wide area networks,2011,Sumit Kumar Bose and Scott Brock and Ronald Skeoch and Shrisha Rao,,,,13-22,IEEE,A virtual machine (VM). during its lifecycle. can be scheduled for execution at geographically disparate cloud locations depending upon the cost of computation and the load at these locations. However. trans-locating a live VM across high-latency low-bandwidth wide area networks (WAN) within 'reasonable' time is nearly impossible due to the large size of the VM image. In this paper. we deal with this problem by combining VM scheduling strategies with VM replication strategies. In particular. we propose to replicate a VM image selectively across different cloud sites. choose a replica of the VM image to be the primary copy and propagate the incremental changes at the primary copy to all the remaining replicas of the VM image.

The design depends on multiple metadata structures for deduplication. Only a copy of the duplicate files is retained while others are deleted. The existence of duplicate files is determined from the metadata. The files are clustered into bins depending on their size. They are then segmented. deduplicated. compressed and stored. Binning restricts the number of segments and their sizes so that it is optimum for each file size.

The aim of this study was to evaluate grape seed (Vitis vinifera). Philippine tung (Reutealis t risperma). and kesambi (Schleichera o leosa) oils as potential feedstocks for biodiesel production to meet this demand. Firstly. biodiesels from these oils were produced and then their fatty acid methyl ester profiles and physicochemical properties were evaluated and compared with palm biodiesel. The results showed that the biodiesel produced from grape seed oil possessed the highest oxidation stability of 4.62 h. On the other hand. poor oxidation stability was observed for Philippine tung biodiesel at 2.47 h. The poor properties of Philippine tung biodiesel can be attributed to the presence of α-elaeostearic fatty acid. Furthermore. synthetic antioxidants (pyrogallol) and diesel were used to improve the oxidation stability. The 0.2 wt.% concentration of pyrogallol antioxidant could increase the oxidation stability of grape seed biodiesel to 6.24 h. while for kesambi and Philippine tung. biodiesels at higher concentrations of 0.3% and 0.4 wt.%. respectively. were needed to meet the minimum limit of 8 h.

Compared to conventional diesel fuel. biodiesel has slightly lower performance in engine combustion due to the lower calorific value that leads to lower power generated. This study investigates the effect of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an additive to the rice bran methyl ester (RBME). Artificial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM) was used for predicting the calorific value. The interaction effects of parameters such as dosage of MWCNTs. size of MWCNTs and reaction time on the calorific value of RBME were studied. Comparison of RSM and ANN performance was evaluated based on the correlation coefficient (R 2). the root mean square error (RMSE). the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). and the average absolute deviation (AAD) showed that the ANN model had better performance (R 2= 0.9808. RMSE= 0.0164. MAPE= 0.0017. AAD= 0.173) compare to RSM (R 2= 0.9746. RMSE= 0.0170. MAPE= 0.0028. AAD= 0.279). The optimum predicted of RBME calorific value that is generated using the cuckoo search (CS) via lévy flight optimization algorithm is 41.78 (MJ/kg). The optimum value was obtained using 64 ppm of< 7 nm MWCNTs blending for 60 min. The predicted calorific value was validated experimentally as 41.05 MJ/kg.

The potential advantages of this alternative scheme in a biorefinery include minimization of heat loss and generation of a higher‐value product: electricity (in MFC) or hydrogen (MEC). The need for 5–15 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol can be reduced significantly via recycling of water after MEC treatment. Removal of inhibitory byproducts such as furans. phenolics. and acetate in MFC/MECs to generate energy. thus. has dual advantages: improvements in energy efficiency and ability to recycle water.

Rigorous empirical studies of renewable energy policy effectiveness have typically relied on panel data models to identify the most effective mechanisms. A common characteristic of some of these studies. which has important econometric implications. is that they assume that the contribution of RES to total electricity generation will be stationary around a mean. This paper reviews such assumptions and rigorously tests the time series properties of the contribution of RES in the energy mix for the presence of a unit root.

Technology-push. demand-pull and endogenous drivers of innovation in the renewable energy industry,2014,Sam Aflaki and Syed Abul Basher and Andrea Masini,,HEC Paris Research Paper No. MOSI-2015-1070,,,,The paper aims to contribute to the longstanding technology-push vs. demand-pull debate and to the literature on renewable energy diffusion and renewable energy policy assessment. We argue that in addition to the traditional push-pull dichotomy. the drivers of technological change must be differentiated by whether they are exogenous or endogenous to the economic system. We maintain that a specific type of endogenous demand-pull mechanism (ie economic growth) is a major catalyst of environmental innovation. We apply this perspective to study the diffusion of renewable energy (RE) technologies in 15 European Union countries from 1990 to 2012. Applying different panel data estimators. we find that public R&D investments. policies supporting RE and per capita income all have a positive impact on RE diffusion. whereas the variability of policy support has a negative impact. However. we also find that economic growth is a stronger driver than either public R&D investments or policies supporting RE. and that models that do not take it explicitly into account tend to overestimate the importance of exogenous drivers. Most importantly. we note that the effect of economic growth on RE diffusion exhibits a nonlinear. U-shaped pattern that resonates with the well-known Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. RE penetration remains negligible at low levels of growth whereas it increases sharply only after income per capita has reached a given threshold and the demand for environmental quality rises. Our findings have implications for policy making.

We couch this work in the area of organizations and intra-firm diffusion of technology. although it is generally applicable to any group of actors who can be positioned within a social network. Technology adoption and diffusion occur through individual choices of more or less autonomous actors among multiple. competing alternatives. Actors choose technologies that they feel will maximize their own performance. but they are boundedly rational. and thus. must rely on their own experience and the experience of adjacent actors in the network to identify and choose among these competing technologies.

These types of materials are not found in nature. but rather need to be fabricated through material processed engineering. Therefore these materials are called metamaterials. The novelty of these engineered materials with their possible applications to support short duration optical soliton pulses is investigated in this paper.Recently reported metamaterials in optical regions have shown promise to make an effective optical waveguide. according to Shalaev [15].

Being an island that is also far from the mainland of Bangladesh. St. Martin’s is in need of electricity. As it has ample renewable energy resources. a renewable energy-based microgrid system seems to be the ultimate solution. considering the ever-increasing price of diesel fuel. This study proposes a microgrid system and tests its technical and economic feasibility in that area. All possible configurations have been simulated to try and find the optimal system for the island. which would be eco-friendly and economical with and without considering renewable energy options. The existing power supply configuration has also been compared to the best system after analyzing and investigating all technical and economic feasibility. Sensitivity and risk analysis between different cases provide added value to this study. The results show that the current diesel-based system is not viable for the island’s people. but rather a heavy burden to them due to the high cost of per unit electricity and the net present cost. In contrast. a PV/Wind/Diesel/Battery hybrid microgrid appeared to be the most feasible system. The proposed system is found to be around 1.5 times and 28% inexpensive considering the net present cost and cost of energy. respectively. with a high (56%) share of renewable energy which reduces 23% carbon dioxide.

Indeed. the IEA predicts that by 2050. with sufficient support over ten percent of global electricity could be produced by concentrating solar thermal power plants. However. CSP plants are just but one of the many possible applications of CST systems. Advances in Concentrating Solar Thermal Research and Technology provides detailed information on the latest advances in CST systems research and technology. It promotes a deep understanding of the challenges the different CST technologies are confronted with. of the research that is taking place worldwide to address those challenges. and of the impact that the innovation that this research is fostering could have on the emergence of new CST components and concepts. It is anticipated that these developments will substantially increase the cost-competiveness of commercial CST solutions and reshape the technological landscape of both CST technologies and the CST industry.

Following this strategy. the integration of small solar tower fields into so-called MIUS (Modular Integrated Utility Systems) is proposed. This application strongly influences field concepts leading to modular multi-tower systems able to more closely track demand. meet reliability requirements with fewer megawatts of installed power and spread construction costs over time after output has begun. In addition. integration into single-cycle high-efficiency gas turbines plus waste-heat applications clearly increments the solar share.

The time resolution of the numerical weather prediction models or satellite derived solar irradiance data are typically limited to 1-h (at best 15-min). Unfortunately. this resolution is not sufficient in the design and performance of a CSTP plant. which shows a nonlinear response to DNI governed by various thermal inertias due to their complex response characteristics. In this study. a new methodology has been developed to increase the temporal resolution of DNI series from 1-h to 1-min.

It shows that theoretical considerations regarding the behavior of non-concentrating solar thermal systems are not enough in themselves to rule out their use in high-temperature applications. In fact. the paper demonstrates that the maximum theoretical thermal efficiency of a non-concentrating system may equal that of a concentrating system if the monochromatic directional emittance of its absorbing surface is sufficiently restricted. It is thus confirmed that the fundamental parameter that determines the ability of a solar-energy system to operate at high temperatures is not optical concentration. but angular selectivity of emittance.,True,17uPLLoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X04000118,2338433270013752933,/scholar?cites=2338433270013752933,,,,0,0,0

Predicting the energy yield of a CSP plant is a crucial task in this process. Mathematical models predicting the system’s energy yield are required to assess single CSP projects (e.g. feasibility or due diligence studies). compare different plant options (e.g. technology. site). optimise technology configuration (e.g. solar field size. storage capacity). investigate the influence of component characteristics (e.g. receiver characteristics). and to assess system performance during commissioning. among other things. The models used for these tasks differ in complexity and required accuracy. e.g. a model used for project assessment during commissioning has to be more rigorous than a model used for a pre-feasibility study. At the moment. numerous modelling approaches exist. and project developers use their own internal system models and assessment methodology. These models often lack validation. and no standard or benchmark for comparison yet exists for electricity yield analysis of CSP plants.  In addition. most current models of CSP system performance do not treat uncertainties inherent in parameters and processes of the complex system.  These conditions fail to alleviate concerns about technology risk and hinders the acceptance of CSP technology by potential investors. To solve this problem. an international working group is being initiated within SolarPACES Task I to define guidelines for electricity yield analysis of CSP plants.,True,17uPLLoAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,16,https://elib.dlr.de/71795,1513556917222223921,/scholar?cites=1513556917222223921,,,,0,0,0

The context for this report is the annual growth of the global CSP industry by 40% since 2005; it is expected that installed capacity will reach 4.5 GWe in 2013. There is unprecedented growth for power tower technology predicted for 2013. with 500 MWe expected to become operational this calendar year compared to the 65 MWe presently in operation. However. for growth to continue. the capital cost of the solar field must continue to be brought down. The cost of heliostats is presently estimated to be in the range 150-200 USD/m2 and the target costs for heliostats are generally in the range 75-120 USD/m2. This indicates that there is an expectation within the industry for large cost reductions. Some of the key findings of the literature review are summarised here by topic:  Leverage of performance: heliostat performance has a strong leverage on LCOE. and as a result the use of mirror with high reflectance is important. The benchmark is 3-4 mm silvered glass mirrors with solar-weighted spectral reflectance around 93-94%. but there is the possibility of achieving higher reflectance through the use of thinner glass and reflective films.  Importance of O&M costs: O&M costs have a strong impact on LCOE when aggressive LCOE targets apply. Compatibility with low-cost cleaning systems is an important design requirement.

The optimum nucleation condition was heating at 760 °C for 1 h. Crystallization of the nucleated specimen in the region of 1050–1200 °C resulted in the formation of two crystalline phases. i.e. anorthite and diopside.

However. the durability of these catalysts is still insufficient for the implementation of these catalysts in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). particularly in automotive power systems. Recently. carbon oxidation has been reported as a main cause for the destruction of ORR active sites in heat-treated metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) PGM-free catalysts (1). This result suggests that in order to improve their durability. M-N-C catalysts should be synthesized at as high a temperature as possible to maximize the graphitic content thereby making the catalyst more oxidation resistant. An optimum heat-treatment temperature for the best ORR activity of M-N-C catalysts depends on many factors. including the synthesis …,True,TU8_brgAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2016-02/38/2825/meta,,,,,,0,0,0

For this reason three main weave structures (plain. satin. and piqué) of cotton fabric were selected with different yarn count. threads per cm. and mass per square meter values. Thereafter. only for the plain weave. the samples were padded using silica sol formed by hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane under acidic conditions. The silanized plain weave samples were characterized by TGA and FT-IR techniques. The thermal properties were measured with a home-made apparatus in order to calculate thermal conductivity. resistance. and absorption of all the treated fabric samples. The relationship between the thermal insulation properties of the plain weave fabrics and the concentration of sol solutions has been investigated. Fabrics weave and density were found to strongly influence the thermal properties: piqué always shows the lowest values and satin shows the highest values while plain weave lies in between.

The exploitation of the resulted data from FTIR is performed by the SIMPLe-to-use interactive self-modelling mixture analysis (SIMPLISMA) method and allows to identify some of the evolved gases and to obtain their relative concentration profiles versus time without prior knowledge of constituents. As shown. this method can work properly for mixture with overlapped bands but some compounds remain “invisible” to FTIR analysis.

1266694,Lessons from first generation biofuels and implications for the sustainability appraisal of second generation biofuels,2013,Alison Mohr and Sujatha Raman,63,Energy policy,,114-122,Elsevier,The emergence of second generation (2G) biofuels is widely seen as a sustainable response to the increasing controversy surrounding the first generation (1G). Yet. sustainability credentials of 2G biofuels are also being questioned. Drawing on work in Science and Technology Studies. we argue that controversies help focus attention on key. often value-related questions that need to be posed to address broader societal concerns. This paper examines lessons drawn from the 1G controversy to assess implications for the sustainability appraisal of 2G biofuels.We present an overview of key 1G sustainability challenges. assess their relevance for 2G. and highlight the challenges for policy in managing the transition. We address limitations of existing sustainability assessments by exploring where challenges might emerge across the whole system of bioenergy and the wider context of the social system in …,True,OKobzQ4AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,326,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513008264,16215035934236082566,/scholar?cites=16215035934236082566,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513008264,0,0,0

This framing is linked to how energy interventions are being imagined and constructed by key actors in the sector. via particular sociotechnical imaginaries through which a set of increasingly universalised energy futures for rural communities is prescribed. Projects are too frequently reverse-engineered through the lens of particular combinations of technologies. financial models and delivery mechanisms. rather than by attending to the particular energy needs/aspirations of individual communities.

Working at the interface of sustainable innovation journey research and geographical theories on the spatial unevenness of sustainability transition projects. we show how the biofuels controversy is linked to characteristics of globalised industrial agricultural systems. The legitimacy problems of biofuels cannot be addressed by sustainability indicators or new technologies alone since they arise from the spatial ordering of biofuel production.

Seen from the perspective of the on-going “democratic deficit” debate. EU regulation of biotechnology is problematic. The prize of European competitiveness mandates EU-level law and policy-making to enhance the expansion of the biotechnology industry. Yet a widespread citizen consensus for such expansion is lacking. The article shows that the EGE is significantly influential in bolstering the acceptance of emerging biotechnologies. by supplying authoritative normative endorsement to legislation and administrative activity that supports the activities of market actors within the biotechnology industry.

This raises important yet relatively unexplored questions regarding how publics are constituted by different forms of engagement used by intermediary scholars and other actors. It is possible to identify at least two possible ‘rationalities of mediation’ that mobilise different versions of the public and the roles they are assumed to play. as ‘citizens’ or ‘users’. in discussions around technology.

1266716,Policy frameworks and supply-chain accounting,2018,Patricia Thornley and Alison Mohr,,Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS),,227-250,John Wiley & Sons Ltd,The majority of future energy scenarios that facilitate the United Kingdom meeting its greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets require the use of negative emissions technologies. and. of these. bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is most often invoked in energy‐system models. This is essential because it offers energy with negative emissions at a relatively competitive cost. Other energy technologies generally incur at least some level of carbon emissions. and other GHG removal technologies are less well proven with consequently higher costs and greater performance and economic uncertainties.However. this characterisation of BECCS as providing net removal of GHGs from the atmosphere is predicated on consideration of the entire supply chain from biomass production through to energy generation and utilisation. It is well established that such a comprehensive supply chain coverage makes sense in most cases in order to ensure that we are assessing the full environmental impact of new energy technologies. However. such a comprehensive scope of system also poses some distinctive challenges. It may provide consistency of comparison to other generation technologies. but does it make sense from an analytical and governance perspective?

A workshop held on Nov 15. 2013. at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and attended by scientists. public health professionals. and decision makers addressed this question. Fracking is at a very early stage in the UK. with only one shale gas well tested so far. This situation provides an important opportunity to gather information and to conduct studies of health and environmental effects before any large-scale development. Scientific study of the health effects of fracking is in its infancy. 1. 2 but findings suggest that this form of extraction might increase health risks compared with conventional oil and gas wells because of the larger surface footprints of fracking sites; their close proximity to locations where people live. work. and play; and the need to transport and store large volumes of materials. 3–6 In the USA. where more than 52 000 shale gas wells have been drilled. data suggest that risks of environmental contamination occur at all stages in the development of shale gas extraction. Failure of the structural integrity of the well cement and casing. 7 surface spills and leakage from above-ground storage. emissions from gasprocessing equipment. and the large numbers of heavy transport vehicles involved are the most important factors that contribute to environmental contamination and exposures in the USA. 2 Environmental exposures include outdoor air pollutants (ie. volatile organic compounds. tropospheric ozone. and diesel particulate matter) 2 and pollutants (ie. benzene. hydrocarbons. endocrine …,True,PDDwltsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,83,http://www.hpaf.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/The-health-implications-of-fracking-1.pdf,9646076782272177468,/scholar?cites=9646076782272177468,,,http://www.hpaf.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/The-health-implications-of-fracking-1.pdf,0,0,0

Similar evaluations for chemicals used in other routine oil and gas development activities. such as maintenance acidizing. gravel packing. and well drilling. have not been previously conducted. in part due to a lack of reliable information concerning on-field chemical-use. In this study. we compare chemical-use between routine activities and the more closely regulated well-stimulation activities using data collected by the South Coast Air Quality Monitoring District (SCAQMD). which mandates the reporting of both unconventional and routine on-field chemical-use for parts of Southern California.

California. following cutting,2006,DF Spencer and GG Ksander and MJ Donovan and Pui Sze Liow and WK Chan and BK Greenfield and SB Shonkoff and SP Andrews,,,,,,Waterhyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms). is a serious problem in the Sacramento Delta. currently managed with herbicides and to a lesser extent biological control insects. The search for alternative methods continues. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that waterhyacinth would not survive treatments made by three types of cutting machines mounted on boats and thus result in open water areas. Waterhyacinth mats were treated by machines 1 and 2 during September. 2003 at Lambert Slough. south of Sacramento. California and at the Dow Wetlands. near Antioch. California. In June 2004. machine 3 cut plants in the Dow Wetlands. Machine 1 sheared off the leaves resulting in many plant fragments and plants that consisted of floating stem bases with intact root systems. The cutting motions of machines 2 and 3 differed and these machines produced numerous plant fragments along with ramets that had been split along a vertical axis into nearly intact ramets with broken leaves. Plants collected immediately after the treatments and grown either in situ or in tubs in Davis. California began to produce new leaves within one week of treatment. Leaf production rates were higher for cut than for un-cut plants. Similarly. plant dry weight increased over the course of the experiments. All of the plants survived in the tub experiments and 65% of them survived in field enclosures for at least six weeks.

SFEI Contribution,,,,Significant management actions are underway that have the potential to change mercury (Hg) concentrations in fish from the San Francisco Estuary. The Hg TMDL is a major effort to reduce Hg accumulation in Estuary fish. and there is concern that extensive tidal marsh restoration could increase Hg in the food web. The TMDL implementation plan includes monitoring of sport fish to protect humans and small fish to protect piscivorous wildlife. Small fish are a useful tool for monitoring inter-annual changes in methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic ecosystems. They integrate fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns of MeHg uptake into the food web. while providing field data on risk to wildlife. From November through December of 2005. eight nearshore locations in San Francisco Bay were sampled with beach seines. Multiple composite samples of five to ten individuals each were collected at each sampling location. weighed. measured. and analyzed for whole-body total Hg concentration. Seven small fish species representing a range of vagility and salinity tolerance were captured. Of 97 composite samples analyzed. 39 (40%) had Hg concentrations higher than a proposed 0.03 μg g-1 (wet-weight) TMDL target threshold. The average wet-weight mercury concentration of the samples was 0.049 μg g-1 and the average total length was 52 mm. Mississippi silverside (Menidia audens) had higher Hg concentration than other species tested. and bay goby (Lepidogobius lepidus) had lower concentrations.

Tactics. and Opportunities,2012,Seth B Shonkoff,,"Berkeley, CA: University of California",,,,The United States (US) sits on an estimated 482 trillion and 827 trillion cubic feet of natural gas with 141 trillion cubic feet stored in the Marcellus shale formation (which underlies parts of Pennsylvania. New York. West Virginia. Virginia. and Maryland) alone (EIA 2012). In the 1990s. powerful new drilling techniques allowed natural gas to be extracted from previously unexploited deep geological formations (shales. tight sands. and coal seams). Subsequently natural gas wells spread rapidly throughout the US. with especially high concentrations in Pennsylvania. Delaware. West Virginia. Wyoming. Colorado. and Texas. To date. Pennsylvania alone has issued nearly 9.000 natural gas drilling permits in the Marcellus Shale. with Bedford County. Pennsylvania alone host to more than 1.950 (Fractracker 2012). The original natural gas extraction technique. developed in the 1940s (Haliburton 2012)(hereafter referred to as traditional fracking). consists the injection of fluids (usually a mixture of water. sand. and chemicals) under high pressure into oil and gas wells to more efficiently extract natural gas.

This question has intrigued economists for a hundred years. and they have created an extensive body of theory to help explain cartel behaviour. This book looks at the experience of actual cartels and challenges their portrayal as found in the existing literature. The eleven chapters by leading researchers of industrial organization study real examples of industrial collusion. The authors investigate the formation. behaviour. activity and purpose of cartels. and illustrate the intricacies of collusive relationships. In the process they question the existing economic theory surrounding the operation of cartels. which in practice do not always adhere to the textbook models or to complex game theoretic rules. Although much economic research suggests that cartels are doomed to failure. the authors find that there are many examples of industries where cartels have succeeded in controlling prices and output over a prolonged period of time. The book is a groundbreaking attempt to study empirically a range of cartels throughout the world. providing both historical and contemporary examples of collusion to enrich the arguments.

1266832,Toward a total-cost approach to environmental instrument choice,2002,Daniel H Cole and Peter Z Grossman,,,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,Most theories of environmental instrument choice focus exclusively on differential compliance costs. But compliance costs comprise only part of the total costs of environmental protection. Administrative costsparticularly the costs of measuring emissions and monitoring compliance-can differ significantly between environmental instruments. Those administrative cost differentials may offset the compliance cost advantages commonly associated with economic instruments. such as tradeable permits and effluent taxes. Moreover. measurement and monitoring constraints may increase ex ante uncertainty over the differential costs and benefits of alternative regulatory policies. That uncertainty may militate against selecting regulatory instruments that appear superior from the perspective of models focusing exclusively on compliance-cost differentials.,True,RKrh5FUAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,38,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1016/S0193-5895(02)20011-1/full/html,17805592634331564087,/scholar?cites=17805592634331564087,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.544.1580&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1266834,Institutions matter! why the herder problem is not a prisoner’s dilemma,2010,Daniel H Cole and Peter Z Grossman,69,Theory and Decision,2,219-231,Springer US,In the game theory literature. Garrett Hardin’s famous allegory of the “tragedy of the commons” has been modeled as a variant of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. labeled the Herder Problem (or. sometimes. the Commons Dilemma). This brief paper argues that important differences in the institutional structures of the standard Prisoner’s Dilemma and Herder Problem render the two games different in kind. Specifically. institutional impediments to communication and cooperation that ensure a dominant strategy of defection in the classic Prisoner’s Dilemma are absent in the Herder Problem. Their absence does not ensure that players will achieve a welfare-enhancing. cooperative solution to the Herders Problem. but does create far more opportunity for players to alter the expected payoffs through cooperative arrangements.

The key to its stability lay in the fact that collusion was largely an effort to create a cost‐reducing distribution network. Because cost was dependent on collusion. the five cartel members could both underprice entrants and punish defectors. It is shown that in a Bertrand‐type price war. colluding firms could effectively drive a defector into bankruptcy.

This paper argues that. in the event of a major energy shock in the US that persists. such legislation is an inevitable response to the demand from constituents that political actors ""do something"". Since shocks by their nature are unanticipated and are often highly technical and complex. boundedly rational legislators cannot generally understand all of the ramifications of the shock. much less hope to craft well-considered and precise legislation to deal with it. But the demand to ""do something"" means that a range of actions is politically necessary. The ""shock"" policy process is modelled as a stepwise legislative decision problem.

They have noted the beneficial cost-spreading function of insurance. as well as the detrimental incentive-distorting affects of insurance. stemming from the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard. Surprisingly. however. scholars have overlooked one of the most important salutary functions that insurance serves for the tort system: it provides much of the information that courts need to apply the marginal Learned Hand formula in negligence cases. The Learned Hand formula is an algebraic formula (B = PL). according to which liability turns on the relation between investment in precaution (B) and the product of the probability (P) and magnitude (L) of harm resulting from the accident.

Crises have been termed a “perceptual category.” events that at least seem to be threatening to society economically or physically or both. A crisis often calls forth public policy responses. but the events themselves are often clouded by uncertainty and ambiguity. Still. policymakers. especially if the perception persists. believe that they must do something in a crisis even when the crisis would likely be ended by market or other social forces. Elinor Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development framework is utilized as a means of organizing and describing the key variables of crises and the policymaking that ensues from it.

In its form. the Terror resembled a one-shot. n-person prisoner's dilemma game. Although the Terror could not have been sustained if prisoners cooperated. most prisoners defected against one another. as the model would predict. Yet the record of the Terror also demonstrated that in a mass purge there exists a wider strategy set than that of the prisoner's dilemma game. Using an illustrative case and a generalized model of purges. it is shown that if prisoners implicate their interrogators and play what is called a “transformation” strategy. they raise the cost to the authority of conducting the purge. In fact. the authority has no consistent best response to the transformation. and the purge should not be sustainable for long thereafter.

The importance of this concept to the development of electric power industry and government regulation in the US cannot be overstated. Because electric power companies have been considered natural monopolies. it has been believed that such companies cannot be competitive. that they must be monopolies. and that they must be regulated by government agencies. Indeed. it is fair to say that the economic theory of natural monopoly has provided the foundation for: the establishment of monopoly power systems in the US; the legal structure that exists with respect to electric power; and the regulatory system established by local. state and federal government bodies to control electric power production. distribution and consumption.

In particular. lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a significant role in almost all storage application fields. including Electric Vehicles (EVs). Therefore. a full comprehension of the influence of the temperature on the key cell components and their governing equations is mandatory for the effective integration of LIBs into the application. If the battery is exposed to extreme thermal environments or the desired temperature cannot be maintained. the rates of chemical reactions and/or the mobility of the active species may change drastically. The alteration of properties of LIBs with temperature may create at best a performance problem and at worst a safety problem. Despite the presence of many reports on LIBs in the literature. their industrial realization has still been difficult. as the technologies developed in different labs have not been standardized yet. Thus. the field requires a systematic analysis of the effect of temperature on the critical properties of LIBs. In this paper. we report a comprehensive review of the effect of temperature on the properties of LIBs such as performance. cycle life. and safety.

However. these relationships vary between ethnic groups. We evaluated. for the first time in an Afro-Caribbean population. the distribution of APOE polymorphisms and their associations with coronary artery disease (CAD). the lipid profile and other cardio-metabolic risk factors.   Methods We studied 712 Afro-Caribbean subjects including 220 with documented CAD and 492 healthy subjects. TaqMan assays were performed to genotype rs7412 and rs429358. the two variants that determine the APOE alleles ε2. ε3 and ε4. The association between APOE genotype and the lipid profile was analysed by comparing ε2 carriers. ε3 homozygotes and ε4 carriers.   Results The frequencies of ε2. ε3 and ε4 in the overall sample were 8%. 70% and 22%. respectively. CAD was not associated with APOE polymorphism. The total cholesterol level was higher in ε4 carriers compared with ε2 carriers: 5.07 vs 4.59 mmol/L (P = 0.016). The LDL-cholesterol level was lower in APOE ε2 carriers compared with ε3 homozygotes and ε4 carriers: 2.65 vs 3.03 and 3.17 mmol/L. respectively (p = 0.002).

A 3-year prospective study was conducted in 216 patients from December 2011. We used four criteria from the nomenclature for PEW proposed by the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism in 2008: serum albumin 38 g/L. body mass index (BMI) ≤23 kg/m2. serum creatinine ≤818 µmol/L and protein intake assessed by nPCR ≤0.8 g/kg/day. PEW status was categorized according the number of criteria. Cox regression analyses were used. Forty deaths (18.5 %) occurred. 97.5 % with a CV cause. Deaths were distributed as follows: 7.4 % in normal nutritional status. 13.2 % in slight wasting (1 PEW criterion). 28 % in moderate wasting (2 criteria) and 50 % in severe wasting (3–4 criteria). Among the PEW markers. low serum albumin (HR 3.18; P = 0.001) and low BMI (HR 1.97; P = 0.034) were the most significant predictors of death. Among the PEW status categories. moderate wasting (HR 3.43; P = 0.021) and severe wasting (HR 6.59; P = 0.001) were significant predictors of death. Diabetes.

The method of assessing lifetime building energy is known as life-cycle energy analysis. With Kyoto target obligations necessitating the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions at the national level. it seems increasingly probable that analyses of this kind will increase in use. If conducted in primary energy terms. such analyses directly reflect greenhouse gas emissions. except for a few processes which involve significant non-energy related emissions such as cement manufacture.

As the evidence for climate change caused by humans is mounting. there are attendant pressures on how changes can be made to the way humans live and work. Education for sustainability is an important part of the journey to live and work in a sustainable manner. Curricula changes to incorporate sustainability education in the built environment disciplines is not a new phenomenon. Often. curricula changes are made from the perspective of the discipline and the individual teaching the subject. with very little engagement with students on whether the knowledge is ‘pitched’at the right level. While most universities undertake their standard course evaluation surveys. the focus of the research reported in this paper is to go beyond the standard evaluation surveys. The research is focused on RMIT students graduating in Construction Management in Melbourne and Singapore. The aim of the study is two fold: to investigate whether students are aware of the importance of sustainability education in their working lives and whether there are any difference in the way students in Melbourne and Singapore view sustainability education.

A review for researchers and practitioners,2019,Casey Furlong and Jega Jegatheesan and Matthew Currell and Usha Iyer-Raniga and Tehmina Khan and Andrew S Ball,56,,,53-61,Pergamon,This study provides practitioners with an overview of previous research on public perceptions of drinking recycled water. Support for potable reuse varies widely across countries. but it is clear that the public is very responsive to context and information. Previous research has made limited use of the fact that (a) wastewater effluent is already present in water supplies across the world. and (b) awareness of this fact can make individuals ten times more likely to highly support potable reuse.

1266916,Reinterpreting the value of built heritage for sustainable development,2010,Paula Judson and Usha Iyer-Raniga,,Green Lines Institute for Sustainable Development Report. Barcelos,,437-48,,To date efforts towards promoting sustainable development in the built environment have been directed largely at new buildings. However. there is growing recognition of the need to understand the value of the existing building stock and its contribution to the broader dimensions of sustainable development.The concept of value lies at the very centre of cultural heritage conservation theory and practice in Australia. This paper focuses on built heritage. drawing on existing literature to examine the multivalent nature of heritage buildings. Although the values approach adopted in the Burra Charter is used as a starting point. this paper explores beyond the established socio-cultural and economic values to consider the value to environmental sustainability; the concept of heritage value is reinterpreted and extended to environmental performance. A review of empirical studies illustrates that methods such as LCA offer promising potential as an instrument for better understanding of the environmental impact and energy performance of heritage buildings. and can provide scientific evidence to substantiate credibility of claims of environmental sustainability. Most sustainability assessment tools do not take into consideration heritage values. Therefore. there is a need to develop new frameworks and practices that reconcile requirements to improve environmental performance of heritage buildings with heritage significance.,True,2Jw2g68AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,7,https://www.academia.edu/download/37318723/H2010_Judson_paper.pdf,15001893735790101187,/scholar?cites=15001893735790101187,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/37318723/H2010_Judson_paper.pdf,0,0,0

However. the limited capacity of municipal Governments to respond to the scale and pace of change is leading to a growth of informal settlements in peri-urban locations. Factors of exposure. sensitivity. and adaptive capacity combine to make these informal settlements the most vulnerable areas to natural hazards. In response to this critical urban resilience agenda. this paper looks at how participatory action research is providing inter-disciplinary scientific support for the implementation of urban resilience and climate actions in Honiara. Solomon Islands. Adaptation measures involve a combination of hard and soft actions; as well as activities designed to strengthen local capacity to respond to contemporary resilience challenges. Addressing the adaptive capacity component. this paper also highlights the opportunities for Australian universities to integrate teaching and learning with action research to achieve a substantive real-world impact in the Pacific region. as well as illustrating the capacity strengthening benefits that can be achieved through sustained engagement and collaborative partnerships with local organisations.

The built environment was recognized as an important factor in reducing global emissions for the first time at the Conference of Parties (COP) 21 meeting in Paris through a dedicated ‘Buildings Day.’The Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC) was also launched at COP 21 as a network to globally support zero emission. efficient and resilient buildings and construction sector. The Paris Agreement brought all nations to collectively combat climate change with a view to limit temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (C). Nations agreed to report their efforts through the monitoring program. In most countries. residential and commercial buildings spend a large proportion of their energy in lighting. heating. ventilation. air conditioning and in various appliances requiring energy for operation. This paper takes a broad understanding of zero energy. Starting with buildings. the definitions also consider understanding zero energy and from a carbon perspective. considering going from beyond buildings to include precincts and cities. The paper brings an understanding of zero energy. its importance. and its urgency with respect to global commitments to reduce the impact of the building and construction sector and the role of governments and industries in supporting the lowering of emissions in the built environment now and in the future.

Here. we designed and fabricated novel ternary non-noble metal carbonate hydroxide (ZNC-CH) nanosheet cocatalysts and integrated them with TiO2 nanorod arrays as highly efficient photoanodes of PEC cells. Compared with the pristine TiO2. the photocurrent of photoanode with the optimal amount of ZNC-CH represents 3.2 times enhancement. and the onset potential is shifted toward the negative potential direction of 62 mV. The remarkable enhancement is attributed to the suppressed carrier recombination and enhanced charge transfer efficiency at the interface of TiO2.

1266953,Investment risks under uncertain climate change policy,2007,William Blyth and Richard Bradley and Derek Bunn and Charlie Clarke and Tom Wilson and Ming Yang,35,Energy policy,11,5766-5773,Elsevier,This paper describes results from a model of decision-making under uncertainty using a real options methodology. developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The model represents investment decisions in power generation from the perspective of a private company. The investments are subject to uncertain future climate policy. which is treated as an external risk factor over which the company has no control. The aims of this paper are to (i) quantify these regulatory risks in order to improve understanding of how policy uncertainty may affect investment behaviour by private companies and (ii) illustrate the effectiveness of the real options approach as a policy analysis tool. The study analysed firms’ investment options of coal- and gas-fired power plants and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies.

It presents an analysis undertaken by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that implements ROA within a dynamic programming approach for technology investment choice. Case studies for gas. coal and nuclear power investment are undertaken with the model. Illustrative results from the model indicate four broad conclusions: i) climate change policy risks can become large if there is only a short time between a future climate policy event such as post-2012 and the time when the investment decision is being made; ii) the way in which CO2 and fuel price variations feed through to electricity price variations is an important determinant of the overall investment risk that companies will face; iii) investment risks vary according to the technology being …,True,rhfdWngAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,256,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988307000801,11447212664603867441,/scholar?cites=11447212664603867441,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.468.9919&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1266955,Modeling investment risks and uncertainties with real options approach,2007,Ming Yang and William Blyth,23,International Energy Agency,,,,Changing energy price in competitive energy markets. uncertain future carbon price. uncertain government policy on climate change. and uncertain international regime on climate change mechanism all pose uncertainties to power sector investment. In a process of project investment evaluation. national governments and development banks traditionally use the methodology of discount cash flow (DCF). Unfortunately. this methodology cannot fully quantify these risks and uncertainties. Real Option Analysis (ROA) offers a nuanced approach to strategic investment that quantitatively takes into account investment risks and the value of the open options for budget decision-makers. The objective of this paper is to present a methodology and a computer model developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to quantify the impacts of climate change policy uncertainties on power investment using ROA approach. The methodologies include the traditional discounted cash flow approach to calculating project net present value. stochastic simulation to capture the characteristics of uncertain variables. and real options to capture investors’ flexibility to optimize the timing of their investment. This paper presents details of the methodology framework. mathematics functions. database. and operation of the model. The results of this analysis are found in Blyth and Yang (2006) and will be included in a forthcoming book of the IEA (2007). Having been applied for case studies. the methodology and modeling have proven effective.

1266963,Climate policy uncertainty and investment risk,2007,William Blyth and Ming Yang and Richard Bradley,,,,,OECD/IEA,Our climate is changing. This is certain. Less certain. however. is the timing and magnitude of climate change. and the cost of transition to a low-carbon world. Therefore. many policies and programmes are still at a formative stage. and policy uncertainty is very high. This book identifies how climate change policy uncertainty may affect investment behaviour in the power sector. For power companies. where capital stock is intensive and long-lived. those risks rank among the biggest and can create an incentive to delay investment. Our analysis results show that the risk premiums of climate change uncertainty can add 40% of construction costs of the plant for power investors. and 10% of price surcharges for the electricity end-users. Climate Policy Uncertainty and Investment Risk tells what can be done in policy design to reduce these costs. Incorporating the results of quantitative analysis. this publication also shows the sensitivity of different power sector investment decisions to different risks. It compares the effects of climate policy uncertainty with energy market uncertainty. showing the relative importance of these sources of risk for different technologies in different market types. Drawing on extensive consultation with power companies and financial investors. it also assesses the implications for policy makers. allowing the key messages to be transferred into policy designs.

Policy Uncertainty in Power Investment,2006,William Blyth and Ming Yang,,,,,,[en] Climate change policies are being introduced or actively considered in all IEA member countries. changing the investment conditions and technology choices in the energy sector. Many of these policies are at a formative stage. and policy uncertainty is currently high. The objective of this paper is to quantify the impacts of climate change policy on power investment. We use Real Options Analysis approach in the study and model uncertain carbon price and fuel price with stochastic variables. The analysis compares the effects of climate policy uncertainty with fuel price uncertainty. showing the relative importance of these sources of risk for different technologies. This paper considers views on the importance of climate policy risk. how it is managed. and how it might affect investment behaviour. The implications for policymakers are analyzed. allowing the key messages to be transferred into policy design decisions. We found that in many cases. the dominant risks facing base-load generation investment decisions will be market risks associated with electricity and fuel prices. However. under certain conditions and for some technologies. climate policy uncertainty can be an important risk factor. creating an incentive to delay investment and raising investment thresholds. This paper concludes that government climate change policies to promote investment in low-carbon technologies should aim to overcome this incentive to delay by sending long-term investment signals backed up by strengthened international policy action to enhance domestic policy credibility,True,rhfdWngAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,26,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:38005198,17298881145322354719,/scholar?cites=17298881145322354719,,,,0,0,0

The objective of this paper is to quantitatively project the two countries’ carbon emission reductions that will likely contribute to or facilitate the global climate change mitigation commitment and strategies in Paris in 2015. A top-down approach is used to analyze the relationship between China economic development and energy demand and to identify potentials of energy savings and carbon emission reduction in China. A simple time series approach is used to project carbon emission reduction in the USA.

1267024,Some recent advances in drying technologies to produce particulate solids,2013,Duu-Jong Lee and Sachin Jangam and Arun S Mujumdar,30,,,69-83,Hosokawa Powder Technology Foundation,Thermal drying is a highly energy-consuming process found in almost all industries accounting for between 10–20% of national industrial energy consumption in the developed economies of the world. It is arguably the oldest unit operation and yet R&D in this area is only a few decades old. Over 50% of products consumed by humans are in particulate form so that drying of wet particulates as well as feedstock such as solutions. suspensions or pasty solids is of great industrial interest. Efficient drying technologies must produce engineered dry particulates of desired quality at minimum cost. low carbon footprint and little environmental impact. This article attempts to provide a global overview of recent advances in drying technologies most of which represent evolutionary innovations. In order to reduce investment costs one needs to enhance drying rates within limits imposed by the product properties and end product quality requirements. Several novel gas-particle contactors for example have been evaluated for drying. Combined modes of heating and hybrid dryers can improve drying performance in some cases. Recent interest in production of nanoparticles by wet processing also has stimulated interest in drying to produce nanoparticles. Drying of heat sensitive biotech and pharmaceutical products also pose new challenges.

1267025,Drying of low rank coal,2011,Arun S Mujumdar and SV Jangam,,M3TC Technical Report2011,,,,It is generally accepted that coal will remain the most significant fossil fuel for generation of electrical power in most parts of the world despite numerous ecological limitations associated with its use. The most significant concerns are related to the global warming and climate change issues due to greenhouse gas emissions from coal combustion and also the release of noxious emissions. Clean coal technologies are being developed around the world to enhance combustion. gasification as well as coal liquefaction processes. All of these processes require low moisture coal. It so happens that there is abundant supply of low rank coals around the globe which contains high moisture content. Their low calorific value and higher costs involved in transporting the water along with coal have discouraged their industrial use in the past. With the rise in demand for coal it is increasingly important to access such coal by upgrading it. The simplest way to upgrade it is to remove the water associated with coal either thermally or nonthermally. Numerous processes have been proposed in the literature for dehydrating coal but their techno-economics are not known.This compilation of our reports consists of several papers which our group at M3TC has written about drying of coal. Specifically here we provide concise overviews of most (not all) of the dehydration technologies that have been published in the public domain. We have covered archival literature as well as patents.

Transport phenomena in porous media. including single phase and multiphase fluid flow through porous media. heat transfer in porous media. and electrical and acoustical transport in porous media. are a subject of most common interest and have emerged as a separate field of study [4–6]. Transport phenomena in porous media. from microscopic to upward scales. cover general theories behind flow and transport in porous media and form the basis for deterministic and stochastic models that describe them. However. the microstructures and transport mechanisms in porous media are very complex in nature. Fractal geometry has been shown to have potential in the analysis of flow and transport properties of porous media (consult recent special issue [7–11]).

In this study we examined the change in sheet resistance of an HNO 3-modified SWCNT film after different drying times at 85 C using various analytical techniques. The shift and suppression in the Raman spectra. bleaching of the transition peaks related to van Hove singularities and a shift in the original peak in the C 1s XPS spectra provided evidence for p-type doping. A decrease in sheet resistance was also observed in the SWCNTs films due to the removal of residual N-methylpyrrolidone solvent on the surface and bundle of SWCNTs.

The results suggest that population diversity benefits from these population combinations while not adversely affecting the ability of the user to find a goal design.

1267097,Evaluating the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from a lightweight plug-in hybrid electric vehicle in a regional context,2012,Anne Marie Lewis and Jarod C Kelly and Gregory A Keoleian,,,,1-6,IEEE,Life cycle assessment provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electrified vehicles (EVs) and their potential for GHG reduction as they gain market share. The magnitude of EVs¿ contribution will depend on the specific combinations of fueling strategies and the other vehicle technologies adopted. For instance. the GHG emissions from plug-in electric vehicles (PHEVs) could increase life cycle emissions if the vehicle is driven in a region with a high carbon grid. Also. vehicle lightweighting with lighter. high strength materials decreases use phase emissions but can increase emissions throughout the material production process. This research develops a method to evaluate life cycle emissions from a lightweight PHEV for use in diverse electric fueling regions.

1267098,Interactive Genetic Algorithms for Shape Preference Assessment in Engineering Design.,2008,Jarod C Kelly,,,,,,In the design of artifacts it is important to realize that designs are judged according to functional as well as subjective measures.  This is especially true in markets where the technology behind the particular artifact is well established. and the costs of production are uniform across the market.  In such cases. users are faced with a decision: the selection of one item from amongst a broad range of similar offerings.  The shape of an object. its geometric features. can be one element of the artifact that may elevate it above the competition in user choice.  The preference that users have for artifact shape is not a scientifically understood field.  Such studies and pursuits are generally the province of artists and industrial designers. who are quite adept at applying their intuition and skills to assess markets and design products to fit them.  However. the shape of an object can also have an important impact on its performance.  If this is the case. then engineers must be involved in analyzing the design to ensure that it meets performance and safety criteria.  This intersection between the form and the function of an artifact lacks tools and applied methods that can allow designers and producers to make scientifically informed decisions to understand the impact of shape preference on performance and vice versa.  This dissertation explores how current preference tools can be applied to the understanding of shape preference. as it relates to a specific artifact.  It is shown here that a meaningful quantification of both shape preference and performance can be obtained and used in decision making.  It is also shown here that interactive genetic algorithms are a tool …,True,5UHjnNsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,23,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/60812,12625836241476593281,/scholar?cites=12625836241476593281,,,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/60812/jckelly_1.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

This study is limited to the Michigan state boundary for the OWF sites and viewshed impacts. Investment cost depends on the depth and distance to shore of the farm. View damage cost depends on household density and consumer willingness to pay to avoid the visual disamenity of wind turbines. Both these costs are dependent on the geographic location and are summed to create an aggregate cost. Using ArcGIS. the OWF siting locations were mapped. with spatial analysis revealing the northern region of the lake at the minimum aggregate cost.

IL (United States),The cumulative global electric vehicle (EV) sales surpassed 3.1 million units in 2017. with 1.9 million units of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). and 1.2 million units of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Of the cumulative global EV sales. The US accounted for 0.40 million BEV sales. and 0.36 million PHEV sales (IEA 2018). Assuming a lifespan of 10 years for EVs. an average battery pack weight of 300 kg for BEVs. and an average battery pack weight of 200 kg for PHEVs. by 2027. 0.2 million metric tons of EV batteries would reach their end-oflife (EOL) in the US Globally. the volume of spent automotive batteries would amount to 0.8 million metric tons by 2027. As the annual global EV sales are expected to grow from 1.4 million in 2017 to 21.5 million in 2030 (IEA 2018). the volume of spent automotive batteries would increase markedly beyond 2027.The retired batteries from EV applications could be reused (that is. batteries are refurbished and then used again in EVs) and/or repurposed (that is. batteries are tested. oftentimes repacked. and then used in less demanding applications such as stationary energy storage). Ultimately. the foreseeable avalanche of spent automotive batteries underscores the need for infrastructure and technologies that will be able to responsibly and sustainably handle and dispose of the spent batteries even if they are used multiple times beforehand.

Algorithms have been developed to expose the designer to new designs and thus spark imagination and improve creativity. The present paper focuses on utilizing interactive genetic algorithms (IGAs). a subset of IEAs. to understand the visual aesthetic preferences of the user. A design concept is input to the IGA program. which utilizes information gathered from the user to create new designs. The program collects preferences from the user in a simulated “marketplace” setting. These preferences inform the evolution of the object’s design over several generations until a final “ideal design"" is reached. This"" ideal design"" is considered to be the most preferred visual aesthetics for that user within the specified design space. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the IGA can locate such ideal designs with high probability. Human studies suggest that users can express their visual aesthetic preferences for a design with the IGA. This is important because few scientific tools exist for acquiring such preference information reliably and efficiently. Design decisions regarding visual aesthetics of a product often interact with its technical attributes.

This modularity has allowed MOFs to be designed and synthesized with adjustable pore sizes and shapes leading to ultrahigh porosity. Among the tens of thousands of known MOF structures. zirconium-based MOFs (Zr-MOFs) have attracted attention not only for their structural properties but also their superior chemical and thermal stabilities. which are critical for a myriad of practical applications. In particular. bipyridine (BPY) functionalized Zr-MOFs have been received recognition for their interesting intrinsic properties. which arise from various post-modification pathways. The fact that post-modification is readily available for such MOFs paves the way towards anchoring specific components (functional groups. metals complexes. and nanoparticles) via the bipyridine docking centers. thus endowing this …,True,lKZw5g4AAAAJ:HKviVsUxM5wC,51,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010854517307324,1730377558247199072,/scholar?cites=1730377558247199072,,,https://globalscience.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/ccr.pdf,0,0,0

From small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) patterns. TiO2 samples were observed to have nanoporous structures with pore sizes between 22–24 nm. The TiO2 also have order degree which depends on the calcination temperature. The potential applicability of the resulting TiO2 is confirmed for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). composed of nanoporous anatase TiO2 and natural dye from antocyanine black rice. UV-Vis measurement of dye extracted from the black rice indicated that the antocyanine chelate can propagate into the TiO2 nanoporous network. The short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) under 100 mWc reached 1.287 mAc with open circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 550 mV and the fill factor of 33.4%.

An instrument can be aptly analysed and synthesized as a system which is a set of interconnected components functioning as a unit. while response is a measure of such unit’s fidelity to its purpose. A real instrument’s response is neither perfect nor identical even under static and replicate-conditions. So appropriate approach to quantify the deviation from the true value is required. It is now widely recognized that measurement results should be expressed in terms of estimated value and an associated uncertainty value obtained by proper analysis. System response analysis is further complicated in dynamic measurements as an instrument does not respond instantaneously to an input that varies in time. This obviously creates a measurement problem. and if these effects are not accounted for. dynamic errors are introduced. Therefore. the performance of a measuring instrument is to be specified in terms of both static and dynamic performance parameters.,True,wdhGG6UAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,15,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nOuZDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:zsAQgUn1mSkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=0_SCtLdZWH&sig=8LO1sdeSt0jn0MXhkKmgKfwH6jk,7457104825128081588,/scholar?cites=7457104825128081588,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Z_Haq/publication/264974885_Applied_Measurement_Systems/links/53f8e7a90cf24ddba7db527a/Applied-Measurement-Systems.pdf#page=13,0,0,0

They have the advantage of being geographically widely produced. in a variety of products and are renewable in nature and thereby not contributing to the net atmospheric concentrations of the green house gas. CO2• However. higher viscosity and lower volatility are identified as the main reasons for the unsuitability of vegetable oils as straight diesel fuel substitute. So. in this study attempts have been made to study the possibiiity of using vegetable oils as diesel fuel substitute by modifying their properties. Hence. kerosene is blended with 4 different vegetable oils ( Rapeseed. Soyabean. Sesame and Lin •. seed) in equal volumes to serve the purpose. Testing of the properties of the vegatable oils. pure and blended. are then performed. It is found that the desities and viscosities of pure vegetable oils are significantly higher than those of diesel (about 10% higher in case of densities & about 12 times higher in case of viscosities). However. when blended with kerosene. these properties are found reduced to a comparable figure (about 0.50% higher in case of densities & about 2.5 times higher in case of viscosities). It is also found that the energy densities of the blended vegetable oils are very close to that of diesel. Carbon residue of vegetable oils are found lower and the ash percentages are found higher than the diesel values.

Here. using a global and unbiased quantitative N-terminomics technology. we show that ∼500 products of caspase cleavage and their kinetics vary dramatically between cell type and cytotoxic drug treatment. It is likely that variations arise from differences in baseline proteome composition of the cell type and the alterations induced by drug treatments to yield a unique cohort of proteins that caspases finally target. Many targets are specific to both drug treatment and cell type. providing candidate-specific biomarkers for apoptosis. For example. in multiple myeloma cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib …,True,lk5kgzcAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C,61,https://www.pnas.org/content/109/31/12432.short,17845477833399564638,/scholar?cites=17845477833399564638,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/109/31/12432.full.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we introduce a quality of monitoring (QoM) metric defined by the expected number of active users monitored. and investigate the problem of maximizing QoM by judiciously assigning sniffers to channels based on knowledge of user activities in a multi-channel wireless network. Two capture models are considered. The first one. called the user-centric model assumes frame-level capturing capability of sniffers such that the activities of different users can be distinguished. The second one. called the sniffer-centric model only utilizes binary channel information (active or not) at a sniffer.

PS deficiency in mice results in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the absence of accumulated Aβ. We hypothesize that PS influences neuroinflammation through its γ-secretase action in CNS innate immune cells. We exposed primary murine microglia to a pharmacological γ-secretase inhibitor which resulted in exaggerated release of TNFα and IL-6 in response to lipopolysaccharide. To determine if this response was mediated by PS1. PS2 or both we used shRNA to knockdown each PS in a murine microglia cell line. Knockdown of PS1 did not lead to decreased γ-secretase activity while PS2 knockdown caused markedly decreased γ-secretase activity. Augmented proinflammatory cytokine release was observed after knockdown of PS2 but not PS1. Proinflammatory stimuli increased microglial PS2 gene transcription and protein in vitro. This is the first demonstration that PS2 regulates CNS innate immunity. Taken together. our findings suggest that PS2 is the predominant γ-secretase in microglia and modulates release of proinflammatory cytokines.

The Greedy algorithm for influence maximization first proposed by Kempe. later improved by Leskovec suffers from two sources of computational deficiency: 1) the need to evaluate many candidate nodes before selecting a new seed in each round. and 2) the calculation of the influence spread of any seed set relies on Monte-Carlo simulations.

Here we present a modular. bottom-up approach that permits the creation of protein-based smart gels with encoded morphology. functionality. and responsiveness to external stimuli. The properties of these gels are encoded by the proteins from which they are synthesized. In particular. the strength and density of the network of intermolecular cross-links are specified by the interactions of the gels’ constituent protein modules with their cognate peptide ligands. Thus. these gels exhibit stimuli-responsive assembly and disassembly. dissolving (or gelling) under conditions that weaken (or strengthen) the protein−peptide interaction.

1267264,Neutrality and the evolvability of boolean function landscape,2001,Tina Yu and Julian Miller,,,,204-217,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,This work is a study of neutrality in the context of Evolutionary Computation systems. In particular. we introduce the use of explicit neutrality with an integer string coding scheme to allow neutrality to be measured during evolution. We tested this method on a Boolean benchmark problem. The experimental results indicate that there is a positive relationship between neutrality and evolvability: neutrality improves evolvability. We also identify four characteristics of adaptive/neutral mutations that are associated with high evolvability.

Heidelberg,We propose building neutral networks in needle-in-haystack fitness landscapes to assist an evolutionary algorithm to perform search. The experimental results on four different problems show that this approach improves the search success rates in most cases. In situations where neutral networks do not give performance improvement. no impairment occurs either. We also tested a hypothesis proposed in our previous work. The results support the hypothesis: when the ratio of adaptive/neutral mutations during neutral walk is close to the ratio of adaptive/neutral mutations at the fitness improvement step. the evolutionary search has a high success rate. Moreover. the ratio magnitudes indicate that more neutral mutations (than adaptive mutations) are required for the algorithms to find a solution in this type of search space.,True,8dqu_bAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,99,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45984-7_2,15784810769765998627,/scholar?cites=15784810769765998627,,,https://neuro.bstu.by/ai/To-dom/My_research/failed%201%20subitem/For-research/Corrupsed/nvjwgy3n7.pdf,0,0,0

1267267,Recursion. lambda abstraction and genetic programming,1998,Tina Yu and Chris Clack,,,,422-431,Morgan Kaufman,Module creation and reuse are essential for Genetic Programming (GP) to be effective with larger and more complex problems. This paper presents a particular kind of program structure to serve these purposes: modules are represented as λ abstractions and their reuse is achieved through an implicit recursion. A type system is used to preserve this structure. The structure of λ abstraction and implicit recursion also provides structure abstraction in the program. Since the GP paradigm evolves program structure and contents simultaneously. structure abstraction can reduce the search effort for good program structure. Most evolutionary effort is then focused on the search for correct program contents rather than the structure. Experiments on the Even-N-Parity problem show that. with the structure of λ abstractions and implicit recursion. GP is able to find a general solution which works for any value of N very efficiently.,True,8dqu_bAAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,65,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10087121/,8448798792858858204,/scholar?cites=8448798792858858204,,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10087121/1/Recursion.pdf,0,0,0

For example. monomorphic typed Genetic Programming (GP) uses type information to reduce the search space and improve performance. Unfortunately. monomorphic typed GP also loses the generality of untyped GP: the generated programs are only suitable for inputs with the specified type. Polymorphic typed GP improves over monomorphic and untyped GP by allowing the type information to be expressed in a more generic manner. and yet still imposes constraints on the search space. This paper describes a polymorphic GP system which can generate polymorphic programs: programs which take inputs of more than one type and produces outputs of more than one type.

Experimental results on a Boolean function and needle-in-haystack problems show that this system enables evolutionary search to find better solutions faster.

Moreover. a hypothesis to describe the search process in this system is proposed and investigated. Our findings lead us to counter the arguments of those who dismiss the usefulness of neutrality.

Initially. foldr structure abstraction identify the promising area of the search space at generation zero.

1267278,Constructing reservoir flow simulator proxies using genetic programming for history matching and production forecast uncertainty analysis,2007,Tina Yu and Dave Wilkinson and Alexandre Castellini,2008,Journal of Artificial Evolution and Applications,,,Hindawi,Reservoir modeling is a critical step in the planning and development of oil fields. Before  a reservoir model can be accepted for forecasting future production. the model has to be updated with  historical production data. This process is called history matching. History matching requires computer flow  simulation. which is very time-consuming. As a result. only a small number of simulation runs are conducted  and the history-matching results are normally unsatisfactory. This is particularly evident when the reservoir  has a long production history and the quality of production data is poor. The inadequacy of the history-matching   results frequently leads to high uncertainty of production forecasting. To enhance the quality of the    history-matching results and improve the confidence of production forecasts. we introduce a methodology    using genetic programming (GP) to construct proxies for reservoir simulators. Acting as surrogates for the    computer simulators. the “cheap” GP proxies can evaluate a large number (millions) of reservoir     models within a very short time frame. With such a large sampling size. the reservoir history-matching results      are more informative and the production forecasts are more reliable than those based on a small number of       simulation models. We have developed a workflow which incorporates the two GP proxies into the history        matching and production forecast process. Additionally. we conducted a case study to demonstrate the        effectiveness of this approach. The study has revealed useful reservoir information and delivered more        reliable production forecasts.

Among many important functional techniques. three were chosen to be included in this research. due to their relevance to GP. They are polymorphism. implicit recursion and higher-order functions. To demonstrate their applicability. a GP system was developed with those techniques incorporated. Furthermore. a number of experiments were conducted using the system. The results were then compared to those generated by other GP systems which do not support these functional features. Finally. the program search space of the general even- parity problem was analyzed to explain how these techniques impact GP performance. The experimental results showed that the investigated functional techniques have made GP more powerful in the following ways: 1) polymorphism has enabled GP to solve problems that are very difficult for standard GP to solve. i.e. nth and map programs; 2) higher-order functions and implicit recursion have enhanced GP's ability in solving the general even- parity problem to a greater degree than with any other known methods.

In this approach. physical properties related to fluid flow are inferred from rock sample data. However. due to the limitations posed in the sample data (sparseness and noise). this method often yields inaccurate results. Consequently. production information is normally used to improve the accuracy of property estimation. This style of modeling is equivalent to solving inverse problems.

The rationality of decision making is implemented using genetic programming (GP). where each trader evolves a population of strategies to conduct an auction. By assigning the GP traders different population sizes to differentiate their cognitive ability. through a series of simulations. we find that increasing the traders’ intelligence improves the market’s efficiency. However. increasing the number of intelligent traders in the market leads to a decline in the market’s efficiency. By analyzing the individual GP traders’ strategies and their co-evolution dynamics. we provide explanations to these emerging market phenomena. While auction markets are gaining popularity on the Internet. the insights can help market designers devise robust and efficient auction e-markets.,True,8dqu_bAAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,20,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-87623-8_13.pdf,5382884832692437866,/scholar?cites=5382884832692437866,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51248273/Co-Evolving_Trading_Strategies_to_Analyz20170108-26782-az02t.pdf,0,0,0

1267288,Polymorphism and genetic programming,2001,Tina Yu,,,,218-233,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Types have been introduced to Genetic Programming (GP) by researchers with different motivation. We present the concept of types in GP and introduce a typed GP system. PolyGP. that supports polymorphism through the use of three different kinds of type variable. We demonstrate the usefulness of this kind of polymorphism in GP by evolving two polymorphic programs (nth and map) using the system. Based on the analysis of a series of experimental results. we conclude that this implementation of polymorphism is effective in assisting GP evolutionary search to generate these two programs.

However. its role in the future remains uncertain. With the adoption of the Paris Agreement. which establishes a mechanism to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development (Article 6.4). it is clear that the role of the CDM as a mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol will end. most likely soon after 2020.However. in terms of its standards. procedures and institutional arrangements. the CDM forms certainly an important base for the elaboration and design of future mechanisms for international carbon markets. The mechanism established under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement includes several provisions that are similar to the CDM. Parties also decided that the rules. modalities and procedures of the new mechanism should be adopted on the basis of the “experience gained with and lessons learned from existing mechanisms”.

The Bali Action Plan (BAP) refers to “cooperative sectoral approaches and sector-specific actions” in order to enhance mitigation efforts. 1 Based on this reference. several Parties have proposed the introduction of sectoral approaches. including new market mechanisms. in submissions under the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA). Sectoral approaches have also been proposed under the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP). as a means for industrialised countries to achieve their mitigation commitments.Many proposals focus on the introduction of new sectoral carbon market instruments. This includes a sectoral CDM. a sectoral crediting mechanism based on no-lose targets. and emissions trading based on sectoral targets. 2 In addition. the use of sectoral approaches has been proposed to determine mitigation commitments by industrialised countries. Some stakeholders propose transnational voluntary agreements or technological cooperation outside the carbon market. Others suggest global sectoral targets or benchmarks. 3 However. under the UNFCCC discussions on sectoral approaches focus so far on introducing new sectoral carbon market instruments and on quantifying mitigation commitments of industrialised countries.,True,Wn8ooHIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,58,http://content.ccrasa.com/library_1/30294%20-%20A%20framework%20for%20a%20sectoral%20crediting%20mechanism%20in%20a%20post-2012%20climate%20regime.pdf,13737250881709854718,/scholar?cites=13737250881709854718,,,http://content.ccrasa.com/library_1/30294%20-%20A%20framework%20for%20a%20sectoral%20crediting%20mechanism%20in%20a%20post-2012%20climate%20regime.pdf,0,0,0
1267300,Options for design of tradable green certificate systems,2000,GJ Schaeffer and MG Boots and C Mitchell and C Timpe and M Cames and T Anderson,,,,,,The main conclusions with regard to the design of Tradable Green Certificate (TGCs) systems for the penetration of renewable energy are as follows. Any design of a national promotion system based on TGCs should: provide substantial pressure to actors in the market without making it impossible to reach their goals; provide sufficient security for investors; provide a stable and predictable growing market for renewables over time; incorporate flexibility mechanisms such as banking. borrowing or compliance to targets averaged over several periods; ensure liquidity and transparency of the TGC-market; provide customers with sufficient information to allow them to make informed choices; anticipate on international trade of green certificates in the future and on interaction with future Carbon Emission Trading schemes. There are no major barriers foreseen for starting national TGC-systems. However. for international trade several issues remain to be solved. These include the procedure of international trade. how to deal with different levels of subsidies and the question what country will get the political credit if a certificate is not consumed in the country of production but elsewhere. These difficulties indicate that formalised EU-wide trade cannot be expected in the near future. However. it is expected that international trade based on voluntary demand will happen soon. because this is in principle possible without government interference. Furthermore. formal trade between a limited number of countries. forming 'TGC-trading bubbles' probably will already occur within the next two years.

In a system of green certificates. producers of renewable electricity receive a certificate for each pre-defined unit of electricity produced. Such a certificate represents the ‘greenness’. or in more general terms the ‘societal value’of the production of electricity from renewable sources. By issuing green certificates two different markets are created for producers of renewable electricity: the market of physical electricity. on which they have to compete like any other electricity producer. and the market of green certificates. Demand for green certificates can originate from several sources. There might be a voluntary demand of consumers (eg by green pricing). Demand can also be imposed by the government on consumers or other actors in the electricity supply chain (generators. distributors. suppliers) via an obligation to generate. transmit. deliver …,True,Wn8ooHIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,24,https://www.ecn.nl/publicaties/PdfFetch.aspx?nr=ECN-C--99-072,468485425037087788,/scholar?cites=468485425037087788,,,https://www.ecn.nl/publicaties/PdfFetch.aspx?nr=ECN-C--99-072,0,0,0

1267306,Emissions trading in international civil aviation,2004,Martin Cames and Odette Deuber and Ulrike Rath,,"OKO Institute, Berlin",,,,The contribution of international aviation to the greenhouse effect is increasing continually. The study investigates how the contribution of aviation can be reduced or limited through emissions trading.

At this point. Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen’s studies enabled to add some other factors in the studies on welfare economics. According to another approach. Sen who is one of the most well-known supporters of new welfare economics developed a new definition of utility which considers the functions and turned toward the essence. against the classical and formal definition of utilitarianism. Sen’s approach is not a radical critique on strong rooted utilitarian thought; it’s more of a corrective and compensative one. The basic aim of this critiqueis to show that the analysis based on pure utilitarian terms can cause important analytical problems on welfare economy.

1267330,The relationship between renewable energy consumption and carbon emissions in Turkey: An ARDL bounds testing approach,2015,Fahri Seker and Murat Cetin,,,2604535,,International Institute of Social and Economic Sciences,This paper deals with the relationship between renewable energy consumption and carbon emissions by incorporating economic growth. population density and trade openness as potential determinants of environmental pollution function in case of Turkey over the period 1960 to 2010. The ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration and vector error correction model (VECM) are used to investigate the long-run and causal relationships between the variables. The empirical results reveal that there exist a long-run equilibrium relationship between renewable energy consumption. economic growth. population density. trade openness and carbon emissions. The empirical results also reveal that renewable energy consumption has a negative long run effect on carbon emissions. There exists an evidence supporting the presence of a positive relationship between carbon emissions and the other variables in the long run. However. there exists no evidence of short run relationship between renewable energy consumption and carbon emissions. The results show bi-directional long run Granger causality between trade openness. population density and carbon emissions and also uni-directional Granger causality running from economic growth and renewable energy consumption to carbon emissions in the long run.

The Partially Stratified Charge (PSC) approach involves micro-direct-injection of pure fuel. or a fuel-air mixture. to create a rich zone in the region of the spark-plug. This has been demonstrated to improve combustion in an ultra-lean bulk mixture. An experimental premixing apparatus was devised to investigate the effect of changing the stoichiometry of the micro-direct-injected charge. In conjunction. a numerical methodology was used as an aid to understanding the complex in-cylinder processes. Although rich premixed micro-injection improved engine performance over the homogeneous case. the fastest heat release rate was found to occur with a pure fuel PSC charge.,True,tuFUfpwAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,43,https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2005-01-0247/,15751214516048691580,/scholar?cites=15751214516048691580,,,,0,0,0

Moreover. if the furnace is designed for flexible fueling (multifueling). this feature gives maximum flexibility also from the standpoint of fuel availability and storage over the year. To fully exploit the fuel potential. the optimal size for these systems is in the lower range end (100 kW) for reasons mainly related to the fuel logistic chain. A Combined Heat and Power (CHP) configuration is furthermore important to balance the relatively low electric efficiency (in the order of 15% and less).
