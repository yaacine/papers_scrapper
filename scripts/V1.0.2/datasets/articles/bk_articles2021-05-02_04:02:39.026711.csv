Most existing regression methods use the one-dimensional. pixel-based error model. which characterizes the representation error individually. pixel by pixel. and thus neglects the two-dimensional structure of the error image. We observe that occlusion and illumination changes generally lead. approximately. to a low-rank error image. In order to make use of this low-rank structural information. this paper presents a two-dimensional image-matrix-based error model. namely. nuclear norm based matrix regression (NMR). for face representation and classification. NMR uses the minimal nuclear norm of representation error image as a criterion. and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to calculate the regression coefficients.

However. existing MMD-based domain adaptation methods generally ignore the changes of class prior distributions. ie. class weight bias across domains. This remains an open problem but ubiquitous for domain adaptation. which can be caused by changes in sample selection criteria and application scenarios. We show that MMD cannot account for class weight bias and results in degraded domain adaptation performance. To address this issue. a weighted MMD model is proposed in this paper. Specifically. we introduce class-specific auxiliary weights into the original MMD for exploiting the class prior probability on source and target domains. whose challenge lies in the fact that the class label in target domain is unavailable. To account for it. our proposed weighted MMD model is defined by introducing an auxiliary weight for each class in the source domain. and a classification EM algorithm is suggested by alternating between assigning the pseudo-labels. estimating auxiliary weights and updating model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our weighted MMD over conventional MMD for domain adaptation.,True,zOVgYQYAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC,230,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yan_Mind_the_Class_CVPR_2017_paper.html,3305832518774276595,/scholar?cites=3305832518774276595,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Yan_Mind_the_Class_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf,0,0,0

The face recognition application of LPP is known to suffer from a number of problems including the small sample size (SSS) problem. the fact that it might produce statistically identical transform results for neighboring samples. and that its classification performance seems to be heavily influenced by its parameters.

This paper presents a dimensionality reduction method that fits SRC well. SRC adopts a class reconstruction residual-based decision rule. we use it as a criterion to steer the design of a feature extraction method. The method is thus called the SRC steered discriminative projection (SRC-DP). SRC-DP maximizes the ratio of between-class reconstruction residual to within-class reconstruction residual in the projected space and thus enables SRC to achieve better performance. SRC-DP provides low-dimensional representation of human faces to make the SRC-based face recognition system more efficient.

MSPCA can be viewed as a further extension of the classical principal component analysis (PCA). sparse PCA (SPCA) and the recently proposed multilinear PCA (MPCA).

MSPCA inherits the sparsity from the SPCA and iteratively learns a series of sparse projections that capture most of the variation of the tensor data.

This paper gives an insight into SRC and seeks reasonable supports for its effectiveness. SRC uses L1-optimizer instead of L0-optimizer on account of computational convenience and efficiency. We re-examine the role of L1-optimizer and find that for pattern recognition tasks. L1-optimizer provides more classification meaningful information than L0-optimizer does. L0-optimizer can achieve sparsity only. whereas L1-optimizer can achieve closeness as well as sparsity. Sparsity determines a small number of nonzero representation coefficients. while closeness makes the nonzero representation coefficients concentrate on the training samples with the same class label as the given test sample.

We use a transformation matrix to transfer both the source and target data to a common subspace. where each target sample can be represented by a combination of source samples such that the samples from different domains can be well interlaced. In this way. the discrepancy of the source and target domains is reduced. By imposing joint low-rank and sparse constraints on the reconstruction coefficient matrix. the global and local structures of data can be preserved. To enlarge the margins between different classes as much as possible and provide more freedom to diminish the discrepancy. a flexible linear classifier (projection) is obtained by learning a non-negative label relaxation matrix that allows the strict binary label matrix to relax into a slack variable matrix.

1276713,A combined approach for clustering based on K-means and gravitational search algorithms,2012,Abdolreza Hatamlou and Salwani Abdullah and Hossein Nezamabadi-Pour,6,Swarm and Evolutionary Computation,,47-52,Elsevier,Clustering is an attractive and important task in data mining that is used in many applications. Clustering refers to grouping together data objects so that objects within a cluster are similar to one another. while objects in different clusters are dissimilar. K-means is a simple and efficient algorithm that is widely used for data clustering. However. its performance depends on the initial state of centroids and may trap in local optima. The gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is one effective method for searching problem space to find a near optimal solution. In this paper. we present a hybrid data clustering algorithm based on GSA and k-means (GSA-KM). which uses the advantages of both algorithms. The GSA-KM algorithm helps the k-means algorithm to escape from local optima and also increases the convergence speed of the GSA algorithm. We compared the performance of GSA-KM with other well-known algorithms …,True,GopXT0MAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,211,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650212000235,14045263754593788309,/scholar?cites=14045263754593788309,,,,0,0,0

One of the main challenges of Radiomics is tumor segmentation. Where manual delineation is time consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. it has been shown that semi-automated approaches are fast and reduce inter-observer variability. In this study. a semiautomatic region growing volumetric segmentation algorithm. implemented in the free and publicly available 3D-Slicer platform. was investigated in terms of its robustness for quantitative imaging feature extraction. Fifty-six 3D-radiomic features. quantifying phenotypic differences based on tumor intensity. shape and texture. were extracted from the computed tomography images of twenty lung cancer patients. These radiomic features were derived from the 3D-tumor volumes defined by three independent observers twice using 3D-Slicer. and compared to manual slice-by-slice delineations of five independent physicians in terms of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and feature range.

I had to rely on books such as Rao (1952) and Cattell (1966a) which. although excellent in themselves. required an appreciation of the terminology and research problems of psychometricians and biometricians before the methods themselves could be understood. The appearance of LJ King's book in 1969 went some way towards relieving this situation. but the level of technical detail was not high. It is still true to say that there is no geographical textbook which adequately sets out the technical basis of the more important multivariate techniques. By'technical basis’ I mean details of the specifications of the statistical models. with information on the assumptions of these models and discussion of the consequences resulting from their violation. I would also include description of alternative methods of estimation when the basic assumptions do not hold. and consideration of the numerical and computational aspects of the particular method. including details of feasible algorithms. This book represents my effort to fill this gap in the literature. The level of mathematical and statistical sophistication of research workers in physical geography is now sufficiently high for a technical book such as this one to be acceptable without the need for large-scale examples and case studies. Such examples have their uses but I feel that. in a book of this nature …,True,s4rTM0YAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,935,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1369140667134685633&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1369140667134685633,/scholar?cites=1369140667134685633,,,,0,0,0

Heuristics proposed by a number of researchers to determine the optimum values of network parameters are compared using two datasets. Those heuristics that produce the highest classification accuracies are tested using two independent datasets. Comparisons are also made among the ANNs designed using optimum settings. the ANNs based on the worst performing heuristics. and the maximum likelihood classifier.

With the increasing availability of multisource remotely sensed data sets. random field models. especially Markov random fields (MRF). have been found to provide a theoretically robust yet mathematical tractable way of coding multisource information and of modeling contextual behavior.

In dealing with multisource data. the determination of source weighting and MRF model parameters is a difficult issue. The authors extend the methodology proposed by A. H. Schistad et al.

We present a simple image operator called seam carving that supports content-aware image resizing for both reduction and expansion. A seam is an optimal 8-connected path of pixels on a single image from top to bottom. or left to right. where optimality is defined by an image energy function. By repeatedly carving out or inserting seams in one direction we can change the aspect ratio of an image. By applying these operators in both directions we can retarget the image to a new size. The selection and order of seams protect the content of the image. as defined by the energy function. Seam carving can also be used for image content enhancement and object removal.

We present video retargeting using an improved seam carving operator. Instead of removing 1D seams from 2D images we remove 2D seam manifolds from 3D space-time volumes. To achieve this we replace the dynamic programming method of seam carving with graph cuts that are suitable for 3D volumes. In the new formulation. a seam is given by a minimal cut in the graph and we show how to construct a graph such that the resulting cut is a valid seam. That is. the cut is monotonic and connected. In addition. we present a novel energy criterion that improves the visual quality of the retargeted images and videos. The original seam carving operator is focused on removing seams with the least amount of energy. ignoring energy that is introduced into the images and video by applying the operator.

Because of the close link between an object’s skeleton and its boundary. these two problems are in many cases complementary. Any partitioning of the object can assist in the creation of a skeleton and any segmentation of the skeleton can infer a partitioning of the object. In this paper. we consider these two problems on a wide variety of meshes. and strive to construct partitioning and skeletons which remain consistent across a family of objects. not a single one. Such families can consist of either a single object in multiple poses and resolutions. or multiple objects which have a general common shape.

Although some topology-based matching methods can be considered pose-oblivious as well. our new signature retains the simplicity and speed of signature indexing. Moreover. contrary to topology-based methods. the new signature is also insensitive to the topology change of the shape. allowing us to match similar shapes with different genus.

Unlike common approaches that segment a mesh using clustering schemes. here we introduce a method that concentrates on the contours for cutting.

The part salience theory provides factors which determine the salience of segments. Our method first extracts features to find candidate contours based on the minima rule.

The huge amount of data needed to be processed by multiview applications is a heavy burden for both transmission and decoding. The joint video team has recently devoted part of its effort to extend the widely deployed H.264/AVC standard to handle multiview video coding (MVC). The MVC extension of H.264/AVC includes a number of new techniques for improved coding efficiency. reduced decoding complexity. and new functionalities for multiview operations. MVC takes advantage of some of the interfaces and transport mechanisms introduced for the scalable video coding (SVC) extension of H.264/AVC. but the system level integration of MVC is conceptually more challenging as the decoder output may contain more than one view and can consist of any combination of the views with any temporal level.

1276754,M2det: A single-shot object detector based on multi-level feature pyramid network,2019,Qijie Zhao and Tao Sheng and Yongtao Wang and Zhi Tang and Ying Chen and Ling Cai and Haibin Ling,33,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,,9259-9266,,Feature pyramids are widely exploited by both the state-of-the-art one-stage object detectors (eg. DSSD. RetinaNet. RefineDet) and the two-stage object detectors (eg. Mask RCNN. DetNet) to alleviate the problem arising from scale variation across object instances. Although these object detectors with feature pyramids achieve encouraging results. they have some limitations due to that they only simply construct the feature pyramid according to the inherent multiscale. pyramidal architecture of the backbones which are originally designed for object classification task. Newly. in this work. we present Multi-Level Feature Pyramid Network (MLFPN) to construct more effective feature pyramids for detecting objects of different scales. First. we fuse multi-level features (ie multiple layers) extracted by backbone as the base feature. Second. we feed the base feature into a block of alternating joint Thinned U-shape Modules and Feature Fusion Modules and exploit the decoder layers of each Ushape module as the features for detecting objects. Finally. we gather up the decoder layers with equivalent scales (sizes) to construct a feature pyramid for object detection. in which every feature map consists of the layers (features) from multiple levels. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MLFPN. we design and train a powerful end-to-end one-stage object detector we call M2Det by integrating it into the architecture of SSD. and achieve better detection performance than state-of-the-art one-stage detectors. Specifically. on MSCOCO benchmark. M2Det achieves AP of 41.0 at speed of 11.8 FPS with single-scale inference strategy and AP of 44.2 with multi …,True,NpTmcKEAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC,255,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4962,13359963855282714219,/scholar?cites=13359963855282714219,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4962/4835,0,0,0

Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial translocation of cofilin appears necessary for the regulation of apoptosis. We report that allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) potently induces mitochondria injury and apoptosis. These events were accompanied by a loss of polymerized filamentous actin (F-actin) and increase in unpolymerized globular actin (G-actin). AITC also induces dephosphorylation of cofilin through activation of PP1 and PP2A. Only dephosphorylated cofilin binds to G-actin and translocates to mitochondria during AITC-mediated apoptosis. Mechanistic study revealed that interruption of ROCK1/PTEN/PI3K signaling pathway plays a critical role in AITC-mediated dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and apoptosis. Our in vivo study also showed that AITC-mediated inhibition of tumor growth of mouse leukemia xenograft model is in association with dephosphorylation of cofilin. These findings support a model in which induction of apoptosis by AITC stems primarily from activation of ROCK1 and PTEN. and inactivation of PI3K. leading in turn to activation of PP1 and PP2A. resulting in dephosphorylation of cofilin. which binds to G-actin and translocates to mitochondria. culminating in the dysfunction of mitochondria. release of cytochrome c and apoptosis.,True,AzJZSAwAAAAJ:pqufTfZDgs0C,43,https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-811X-11-50,14811247777215862057,/scholar?cites=14811247777215862057,,,https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-811X-11-50,0,0,0

We reconcile both expressiveness and complexity through the use of complex-valued embeddings and explore the link between such complex-valued embeddings and unitary diagonalization. We corroborate our approach theoretically and show that all real square matrices—thus all possible relation/adjacency matrices—are the real part of some unitarily diagonalizable matrix. This results opens the door to a lot of other applications of square matrices factorization. Our approach based on complex embeddings is arguably simple. as it only involves a Hermitian dot product. the complex counterpart of the standard dot product between real vectors. whereas other methods resort to more and more complicated composition functions to increase their expressiveness. The proposed complex embeddings are scalable to large data sets as it remains linear in both space and time. while consistently outperforming alternative approaches on standard link prediction benchmarks. 1,True,_MVzC_EAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC,127,https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-563/16-563.pdf,214930159414278577,/scholar?cites=214930159414278577,,,https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-563/16-563.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,A novel method for detecting neural activity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is introduced. It is based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA). which is a multivariate extension of the univariate correlation analysis widely used in fMRI. To detect homogeneous regions of activity. the method combines a subspace modeling of the hemodynamic response and the use of spatial relationships. The spatial correlation that undoubtedly exists in fMR images is completely ignored when univariate methods such as as t‐tests. F‐tests. and ordinary correlation analysis are used. Such methods are for this reason very sensitive to noise. leading to difficulties in detecting activation and significant contributions of false activations. In addition. the proposed CCA method also makes it possible to detect activated brain regions based not only on thresholding a correlation coefficient. but also on physiological …,True,pihEm_IAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,269,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1522-2594(200102)45:2%3C323::AID-MRM1041%3E3.0.CO;2-%23,11891222409878093705,/scholar?cites=11891222409878093705,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/1522-2594(200102)45:2%3C323::AID-MRM1041%3E3.0.CO;2-%23,0,0,0
1276812,Canonical correlation: a tutorial,2001,Magnus Borga,4,On line tutorial http://people. imt. liu. se/magnus/cca,,5,,Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a way of measuring the linear relationship between two multidimensional variables. It finds two bases. one for each variable. that are optimal with respect to correlations and. at the same time. it finds the corresponding correlations. In other words. it finds the two bases in which the correlation matrix between the variables is diagonal and the correlations on the diagonal are maximized. The dimensionality of these new bases is equal to or less than the smallest dimensionality of the two variables. An important property of canonical correlations is that they are invariant with respect to affine transformations of the variables. This is the most important difference between CCA and ordinary correlation analysis which highly depend on the basis in which the variables are described. CCA was developed by H. Hotelling [10]. Although being a standard tool in statistical analysis. where canonical correlation has been used for example in economics. medical studies. meteorology and even in classification of malt whisky. it is surprisingly unknown in the fields of learning and signal processing.

Fiber traces are compared pairwise to create a weighted undirected graph which is partitioned into coherent sets using the normalized cut (Ncut) criterion. A simple and yet effective method for pairwise comparison of fiber traces is presented which in combination with the Ncut criterion is shown to produce plausible segmentations of both synthetic and real fiber trace data.

The window size must be large enough to include enough intensity variation for reliable matching. but small enough to avoid the effects of projective distortion. If the window is too small and does not cover enough intensity variation. it gives a poor disparity estimate. because the signal (intensity variation) to noise ratio is low. If. on the other hand. the window is too large and covers a region in which the depth of scene points (i.e.. disparity) varies. then the position of maximum correlation or minimum SSD may not represent correct matching due to different projective distortions in the left and right images. For this reason. a window size must be selected adaptively depending on local variations of intensity and disparity.

For example. the performance of an image denoising algorithm can be much degraded due to the poor noise level estimation. Most existing denoising algorithms simply assume the noise level is known that largely prevents them from practical use. Moreover. even with the given true noise level. these denoising algorithms still cannot achieve the best performance. especially for scenes with rich texture. In this paper. we propose a patch-based noise level estimation algorithm and suggest that the noise level parameter should be tuned according to the scene complexity.

The first is the variation of the signal within the window. which must be large enough. relative to noise. that the SSD values exhibit a clear and sharp minimum at the correct disparity. The second factor is the variation of disparity within the window. which must be small enough that signals of corresponding positions are duly compared.

Such situations represent a major challenge for current large-scale place recognition methods. This work has the following three principal contributions.

Repeated structures are notoriously hard for establishing correspondences using multi-view geometry.

In this work we show that repeated structures are not a nuisance but. when appropriately represented. they form an important distinguishing feature for many places. We describe a representation of repeated structures suitable for scalable retrieval.

It has three main components:(1) a simple and powerful image analysis algorithm that classifies image pixels as either border or interior.(2) a new logarithmic distance (dLog) for comparing histograms. and (3) a compact representation for the visual features extracted from images. Experimental results show that the BIC approach is consistently more compact. more efficient and more effective than state-of-the-art CBIR approaches based on sophisticated image analysis algorithms and complex distance functions. It was also observed that the dLog distance function has two main advantages over vectorial distances (eg.

In the past. they have presented three segmentation paradigms: live wire. live lane. and a three-dimensional (3-D) extension of the live-wire method. Here. they introduce an ultra-fast live-wire method. referred to as live wire on the fly for further reducing user's time compared to the basic live-wire method. In live wire. 3-D/four-dimensional (4-D) object boundaries are segmented in a slice-by-slice fashion. To segment a two-dimensional (2-D) boundary. the user initially picks a point on the boundary and all possible minimum-cost paths from this point to all other points in the image are computed via Dijkstra's algorithm.

In this scenario. it is necessary to develop appropriate information systems to efficiently manage these collections. The commonest approaches use the so-called Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems. Basically. these systems try to retrieve images similar to a user-defined specification or pattern (eg. shape sketch. image example). Their goal is to support image retrieval based on content properties (eg. shape. color. texture). usually encoded into feature vectors. One of the main advantages of the CBIR approach is the possibility of an automatic retrieval process. instead of the traditional keyword-based approach. which usually requires very laborious and time-consuming previous annotation of database images.

This creates a tremendous challenge for pattern recognition techniques. which need to be more efficient without losing their effectiveness. We have tried to circumvent the problem by reducing it into the fast computation of an optimum-path forest (OPF) in a graph derived from the training samples. In this forest. each class may be represented by multiple trees rooted at some representative samples. The forest is a classifier that assigns to a new sample the label of its most strongly connected root. The methodology has been successfully used with different graph topologies and learning techniques.

Investigations were carried out during August–October. 2009-2010. on 33 species. in the Botanical garden of the Banaras Hindu University at Varanasi. India. Estimates of leaf area were obtained by the equation. leaf area (cm2)= x/y. where x is the weight (g) of the area covered by the leaf outline on a millimeter graph paper. and y is the weight of one cm2 of the same graph paper. These estimates were then compared with destructive measurements obtained through a leaf area meter; the two sets of estimates were significantly and linearly related with each other. and hence the millimeter graph paper method can be used for estimating leaf area in lieu of leaf area meter. The important characteristics of this cost-efficient technique are its easiness and suitability for precise. non-destructive estimates.

The flux decay constant of the optical afterglow in the R-band is -2.30 ± 0.07 up to ~5 days. which is very likely due to the jet e ffect. and it is followed by a much steeper decay with constant -3.2 ± 0.2. the fastest one ever seen in a GRB optical afterglow. A negative detection in several all-sky films taken simultaneously with the event. that otherwise would have reached naked eye brightness. implies either a previous additional break prior to ~2 days after the occurrence of the GRB (as expected from the jet effect) or a maximum. as observed in GRB 970508.

However. we show that the linear equation in the proposed algorithm can be decomposed into four independent subequations. requiring much lower computational load and simpler hardware structure than existing algorithms. while providing adequate performances.

1276871,Learning full pairwise affinities for spectral segmentation,2013,Tae Hoon Kim and Kyoung Mu Lee and Sang Uk Lee,35,IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,7,1690-1703,IEEE,Segmenting a single image into multiple coherent groups remains a challenging task in the field of computer vision. Particularly. spectral segmentation which uses the global information embedded in the spectrum of a given image's affinity matrix is a major trend in image segmentation. This paper focuses on the problem of efficiently learning a full range of pairwise affinities gained by integrating local grouping cues for spectral segmentation. We first construct a sparse multilayer graph whose nodes are both the pixels and the oversegmented regions obtained by an unsupervised segmentation algorithm. By applying the semi-supervised learning strategy to this graph. the intra and interlayer affinities between all pairs of nodes can be estimated without iteration. These pairwise affinities are then applied into the spectral segmentation algorithms.

Both DT and NB classifiers are useful. efficient and commonly used for solving classification problems in data mining. Since the presence of noisy contradictory instances in the training set may cause the generated decision tree suffers from overfitting and its accuracy may decrease. in our first proposed hybrid DT algorithm. we employ a naïve Bayes (NB) classifier to remove the noisy troublesome instances from the training set before the DT induction. Moreover. it is extremely computationally expensive for a NB classifier to compute class conditional independence for a dataset with high dimensional attributes.

We consider a scenario where a client equipped with a fingerprint reader is interested into learning if the acquired fingerprint belongs to the database of authorized entities managed by a server. For security. it is required that the client does not learn anything on the database and the server should not get any information about the requested biometry and the outcome of the matching process. The proposed protocol follows a multi-party computation approach and makes extensive use of homomorphic encryption as underlying cryptographic primitive.

The blurring matrices obtained by using the zero boundary condition (corresponding to assuming dark background outside the scene) are Toeplitz matrices for one-dimensional problems and block-Toeplitz--Toeplitz-block matrices for two-dimensional cases. They are computationally intensive to invert especially in the block case. If the periodic boundary condition is used. the matrices become (block) circulant and can be diagonalized by discrete Fourier transform matrices.

1276936,A distance metric for multidimensional histograms,1985,Michael Werman and Shmuel Peleg and Azriel Rosenfeld,32,"Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing",3,328-336,Academic Press,A metric is defined on the space of multidimensional histograms. Such histograms store in thexth location the number of events with feature vectorx; examples are gray level histograms and co-occurrence matrices of digital images. Given two multidimensional histograms. each is “unfolded” and a minimum distance pairing is performed using a distance metric on the feature vectorsx. The sum of the distances in the minimal pairing is used as the “match distance” between the histograms. This distance is shown to be a metric. and in the one-dimensional case is equal to the absolute difference of the two cumulative distribution functions. Among other applications. it facilitates direct computation of the distance between co-occurrence matrices or between point patterns. The problem of finding a translation to minimize the distance between point patterns is also discussed.,True,WBeDvikAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,208,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0734189X85900556,938234612124861681,/scholar?cites=938234612124861681,,,http://w3.cs.huji.ac.il/~peleg/papers/cvgip85-Distance.pdf,0,0,0

We discuss the image normalization to be applied to the images before their comparison so that the computed distance is symmetric with respect to the two images. We then give a general (metric) definition of the distance between images. which leads to the same expressions for the similarity and affine cases. This definition avoids ad hoc decisions about normalization. Moreover. it makes it possible to compute the distance between images under different conditions. including cases where the images are treated asymmetrically.

1276939,The computation of optical flow,1995,Steven S.  Beauchemin and John L.  Barron,27,,3,433-466,ACM,Two-dimensional image motion is the projection of the three-dimensional motion of objects. relative to a visual sensor. onto its image plane. Sequences of time-orderedimages allow the estimation of projected two-dimensional image motion as either instantaneous image velocities or discrete image displacements. These are usually called the optical flow field or the image velocity field. Provided that optical flow is a reliable approximation to two-dimensional image motion. it may then be used to recover the three-dimensional motion of the visual sensor (to within a scale factor) and the three-dimensional surface structure (shape or relative depth) through assumptions concerning the structure of the optical flow field. the three-dimensional environment. and the motion of the sensor.

1276940,Tutorial: Computing 2D and 3D optical flow,2005,John L Barron and Neil A Thacker,1,"Imaging science and biomedical engineering division, medical school, university of manchester",,,,Optical flow is an approximation of the local image motion based upon local derivatives in a given sequence of images. That is. in 2D it specifies how much each image pixel moves between adjacent images while in 3D in specifies how much each volume voxel moves between adjacent volumes. The 2D image sequences used here are formed under perspective projection via the relative motion of a camera and scene objects. The 3D volume sequences used here were formed under orthographic projection for a stationary sensor and a moving/deforming object. In both cases. the moving patterns cause temporal varieties of the image brightness. It is assumed that all temporal intensity changes are due to motion only. This is usually true but there are many exceptions (see below). 2D/3D derivatives are usually computed by repeated application of lowpass and highpass filters. for example the filters proposed by Simoncelli [2]. Thus the computation of differential optical flow is. essentially. a two-step procedure:1. measure the spatio-temporal intensity derivatives (which is equivalent to measuring the velocities normal to the local intensity structures) and2. integrate normal velocities into full velocities. for example. either locally via a least squares calculation [4. 28] or globally via a regularization [3. 28].Such algorithms are generally designed to work on a specific form of image 1. There can be no occlusion (one object moving in front of/or behind another object). again unless this is modelled for. Similarly we assume there are no specularities in the scene (otherwise the light source (s) and sensor (s) positions would have to be explicitly modelled).,True,seL6IFAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,154,http://www.tina-vision.net/docs/memos/2004-012.pdf,3652189303121888176,/scholar?cites=3652189303121888176,,,http://www.tina-vision.net/docs/memos/2004-012.pdf,0,0,0

1276950,Endmember extraction from highly mixed data using minimum volume constrained nonnegative matrix factorization,2007,Lidan Miao and Hairong Qi,45,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,3,765,IEEE; 1999,Endmember extraction is a process to identify the hidden pure source signals from the mixture. In the past decade. numerous algorithms have been proposed to perform this estimation. One commonly used assumption is the presence of pure pixels in the given image scene. which are detected to serve as endmembers. When such pixels are absent. the image is referred to as the highly mixed data. for which these algorithms at best can only return certain data points that are close to the real endmembers. To overcome this problem. we present a novel method without the pure pixel assumption. referred to as the minimum volume constrained non-negative matrix factorization (MVC-NMF). for unsupervised endmember extraction from highly mixed image data. Two important facts are exploited: first. the spectral data are non-negative; second. the simplex volume determined by the endmembers is the minimum among all possible simplexes that circumscribe the data scatter space. The proposed method takes advantage of the fast convergence of NMF schemes. and at the same time eliminates the pure pixel assumption. The experimental results based on a set of synthetic mixtures and a real image scene demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several other advanced endmember detection approaches.,True,GqnNG-kAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,841,http://aicip.eecs.utk.edu/mediawiki/images/8/86/07tgrs-mvcnmf.pdf,10868261326619627029,/scholar?cites=10868261326619627029,,,http://aicip.eecs.utk.edu/mediawiki/images/8/86/07tgrs-mvcnmf.pdf,0,0,0

The answer is probably a"" No."" Most existing face aging works attempt to learn the transformation between age groups and thus would require the paired samples as well as the labeled query image. In this paper. we look at the problem from a generative modeling perspective such that no paired samples is required. In addition. given an unlabeled image. the generative model can directly produce the image with desired age attribute. We propose a conditional adversarial autoencoder (CAAE) that learns a face manifold. traversing on which smooth age progression and regression can be realized simultaneously. In CAAE. the face is first mapped to a latent vector through a convolutional encoder. and then the vector is projected to the face manifold conditional on age through a deconvolutional generator. The latent vector preserves personalized face features (ie. personality) and the age condition controls progression vs. regression.

This paper reviews recent developments in DSNs from four aspects: network structure. data processing paradigm. sensor fusion algorithm with emphasis on fault-tolerant algorithm design. and optimal sensor deployment strategy.,True,GqnNG-kAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,221,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003201000266,9835791615318427355,/scholar?cites=9835791615318427355,,,http://users.cis.fiu.edu/~iyengar/publication/J-(2001)%20-%20Distributed%20sensor%20networksFa%20review%20of%20recent%20research%20-%5BJournal%20of%20the%20Franklin%20Institute%5D.pdf,0,0,0
1276958,Group sparsity and geometry constrained dictionary learning for action recognition from depth maps,2013,Jiajia Luo and Wei Wang and Hairong Qi,,,,1809-1816,,Human action recognition based on the depth information provided by commodity depth sensors is an important yet challenging task. The noisy depth maps. different lengths of action sequences. and free styles in performing actions. may cause large intra-class variations. In this paper. a new framework based on sparse coding and temporal pyramid matching (TPM) is proposed for depthbased human action recognition. Especially. a discriminative class-specific dictionary learning algorithm is proposed for sparse coding. By adding the group sparsity and geometry constraints. features can be well reconstructed by the sub-dictionary belonging to the same class. and the geometry relationships among features are also kept in the calculated coefficients. The proposed approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets captured by depth cameras. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm repeatedly achieves superior performance to the state of the art algorithms. Moreover. the proposed dictionary learning method also outperforms classic dictionary learning approaches.,True,GqnNG-kAAAAJ:wGzT3bKASkAC,214,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2013/html/Luo_Group_Sparsity_and_2013_ICCV_paper.html,487807321523103622,/scholar?cites=487807321523103622,,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2013/papers/Luo_Group_Sparsity_and_2013_ICCV_paper.pdf,0,0,0
1276959,Beta process joint dictionary learning for coupled feature spaces with application to single image super-resolution,2013,Li He and Hairong Qi and Russell Zaretzki,,,,345-352,,This paper addresses the problem of learning overcomplete dictionaries for the coupled feature spaces. where the learned dictionaries also reflect the relationship between the two spaces. A Bayesian method using a beta process prior is applied to learn the over-complete dictionaries. Compared to previous couple feature spaces dictionary learning algorithms. our algorithm not only provides dictionaries that customized to each feature space. but also adds more consistent and accurate mapping between the two feature spaces. This is due to the unique property of the beta process model that the sparse representation can be decomposed to values and dictionary atom indicators. The proposed algorithm is able to learn sparse representations that correspond to the same dictionary atoms with the same sparsity but different values in coupled feature spaces. thus bringing consistent and accurate mapping between coupled feature spaces. Another advantage of the proposed method is that the number of dictionary atoms and their relative importance may be inferred non-parametrically. We compare the proposed approach to several state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods by applying this method to single image super-resolution. The experimental results show that dictionaries learned by our method produces the best superresolution results compared to other state-of-the-art methods.,True,GqnNG-kAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C,183,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2013/html/He_Beta_Process_Joint_2013_CVPR_paper.html,6732962222572104326,/scholar?cites=6732962222572104326,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2013/papers/He_Beta_Process_Joint_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Other chapters discuss impacts from a physical. chemical. biological. or social perspective. Economic impacts cannot be isolated; therefore. there are a large number of cross-references to sections in other chapters of this report. In some cases. particularly agriculture. the discussion of the economic impacts is integrated with the other impacts. Focusing on the potential impact of climate change on economic activity. this chapter addresses questions such as: How does climate change affect the demand for a particular good or service? What is the impact on its supply? How do supply and demand interact in the market? What are the effects on producers and consumers? What is the effect on the overall economy. and on welfare? An inclusive approach was taken. discussing all sectors of the economy. Section SM10.1 found in this chapter’s on-line supplementary material shows the list of sectors according to the International Standard Industrial Classification. This assessment reflects the breadth and depth of the state of knowledge across these sectors; many of which have not been evaluated in the literature.

To fill an academic gap that persists regarding bloggers’ switching behavior across online service substitutes. this empirical study investigates which factors affect bloggers who switch social network sites. in an attempt to understand specifically how push. pull. and mooring factors shape their switching intentions. The data to test the hypotheses come from an online survey of 319 bloggers. analyzed using partial least squares techniques. The results confirm positive influences of push and pull effects. a negative influence of mooring effects. and an interactive effect of push and mooring on switching intentions.

Effects of hole diameter and positions on the performance of VGs were evaluated using dimensionless numbers – j/j0. f/f0 and R = (j/j0)/(f/f0). The results showed that curved winglet type VGs (CRWP.

1276989,A review on fracture-initiation and-propagation pressures for lost circulation and wellbore strengthening,2016,Yongcun Feng and John F Jones and KE Gray,31,,02,134-144,Society of Petroleum Engineers,Fracture-initiation pressure (FIP) and fracture-propagation pressure (FPP) are both important considerations for preventing and mitigating lost circulation. For significant fluid loss to occur. a fracture must initiate on an intact wellbore or reopen on a wellbore with pre-existing fractures. and then propagate into the farfield region. Wellbore-strengthening operations are designed to increase one or both of these two pressures to combat lost circulation. Currently. some theoretical models assume that FIPs and FPPs are only functions of in-situ stress and rock-mechanical properties. However. as demonstrated by numerous field and laboratory observations. they are also highly related to drilling-fluid properties and to interactions between the drilling fluid and formation rock. This paper discusses the mechanisms of lost circulation and wellbore strengthening. with an emphasis on factors that can affect FIP and FPP.

Here we presented an efficient method for generating soluble proteins from inclusion bodies by using two steps of denaturation and one step of refolding. We first demonstrated the advantages of this method over a conventional procedure with one denaturation step and one refolding step using three proteins with different folding properties. The refolded proteins were found to be active using in vitro tests and a bioassay. We then tested the general applicability of this method by analyzing 88 proteins from human and other organisms. all of which were expressed as inclusion bodies. We found that about 76% of these proteins were refolded with an average of >75% yield of soluble proteins. This “two-step-denaturing and refolding” (2DR) method is simple. highly efficient and generally applicable; it can be utilized to obtain active recombinant proteins for both basic research and industrial purposes.,True,7MpSPdEAAAAJ:jq04SsiGh3QC,112,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022981,12107103348811346190,/scholar?cites=12107103348811346190,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022981,0,0,0

On the other hand. dimensionality reduction is also an important issue for FR. It cannot only reduce significantly the storage space of face images. but also enhance the discrimination of face feature. Existing methods mostly perform dimensionality reduction and dictionary learning separately. which may not fully exploit the discriminative information in the training samples. In this paper. we propose to learn jointly the projection matrix for dimensionality reduction and the discriminative dictionary for face representation.

The algorithm exploits the inherent multiscale structure of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to individually decompose each input image into one low-pass subband and six directional high-pass subbands at each scale. To avoid illumination variation issue possibly incurred in the low-pass subband. only the DT-CWT coefficient difference resulted from the six high-pass subbands of the two satellite images under comparison is analyzed in order to decide whether each subband pixel intensity has incurred a change. Such a binary decision is based on an unsupervised thresholding derived from a mixture statistical model. with a goal of minimizing the total error probability of change detection.

The postures that the individual adopts can be regarded as the states of the HMM and are typical to that individual and provide a means of discrimination.

A continuous-state hidden Markov model is defined for landmark shape dynamics in an activity. The configuration of landmarks at a given time forms the observation vector. and the corresponding shape and the scaled Euclidean motion parameters form the hidden-state vector …",True,hfgwx0oAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,172,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1510694/,11829294949829209702,/scholar?cites=11829294949829209702,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/188702445.pdf,0,0,0

This information is very useful for applications in 3D reconstruction. motion. recognition. image enhancement and restoration. image registration. image compression. and so on. Usually. edge detection requires smoothing and di erentiation of the image. Di erentiation is an ill-conditioned problem and smoothing results in a loss of information. It is di cult to design a general edge detection algorithm which performs well in many contexts and captures the requirements of subsequent processing stages. Consequently. over the history of digital image processing a variety of edge detectors have been devised which di er in their mathematical and algorithmic properties.

The speckle distribution in the SAR image is modeled by a Gamma function. Thus. the SAR image histogram exhibits a combination of Gamma distributions. The maximum likelihood technique is therefore used to estimate the histogram parameters. This technique requires knowledge of the number of modes of the histogram. the number of looks of the SAR image. and the initial parameters of the histogram. The second derivative of the histogram is used to estimate the number of modes. We use two methods to estimate the number of looks.

1277050,Exploiting the Circulant Structure of Tracking-by-detection with Kernels,2012,Joao F Henriques and Rui Caseiro and Pedro Martins and Jorge Batista,,,,,Elsevier,Recent years have seen greater interest in the use of discriminative classifiers in tracking systems. owing to their success in object detection. They are trained online with samples collected during tracking. Unfortunately. the potentially large number of samples becomes a computational burden. which directly conflicts with real-time requirements. On the other hand. limiting the samples may sacrifice performance.Interestingly. we observed that. as we add more and more samples. the problem acquires circulant structure. Using the well-established theory of Circulant matrices. we provide a link to Fourier analysis that opens up the possibility of extremely fast learning and detection with the Fast Fourier Transform.

To achieve this effect. we introduce multiplicative second-order analogues of average and max-pooling that together with appropriate non-linearities lead to state-of-the-art performance on free-form region recognition. without any type of feature coding. Instead of coding. we found that enriching local descriptors with additional image information leads to large performance gains. especially in conjunction with the proposed pooling methodology.

A severe limitation is the inability to model multiple objects that are merged into a single measurement. and track them as a group. while retaining optimality. This work presents a new graph structure that encodes these multiple-match events as standard one-to-one matches. allowing computation of the solution in polynomial time. Since identities are lost when objects merge. an efficient method to identify groups is also presented. as a flow circulation problem. The problem of tracking individual objects across groups is then posed as a standard optimal assignment.

1277057,Beyond Hard Negative Mining: Efficient Detector Learning via Block-Circulant Decomposition,2013,Joao F Henriques and Joao Carreira and Rui Caseiro and Jorge Batista,,,,,IEEE,Competitive sliding window detectors require vast training sets. Since a pool of natural images provides a nearly endless supply of negative samples. in the form of patches at different scales and locations. training with all the available data is considered impractical. A staple of current approaches is hard negative mining. a method of selecting relevant samples. which is nevertheless expensive. Given that samples at slightly different locations have overlapping support. there seems to be an enormous amount of duplicated work. It is natural. then. to ask whether these redundancies can be eliminated. In this paper. we show that the Gram matrix describing such data is block-circulant. We derive a transformation based on the Fourier transform that block-diagonalizes the Gram matrix. at once eliminating redundancies and partitioning the learning problem. This decomposition is valid for any dense features and several learning algorithms. and takes full advantage of modern parallel architectures. Surprisingly. it allows training with all the potential samples in sets of thousands of images. By considering the full set. we generate in a single shot the optimal solution. which is usually obtained only after several rounds of hard negative mining. We report speed gains on Caltech Pedestrians and INRIA Pedestrians of over an order of magnitude. allowing training on a desktop computer in a couple of minutes.,True,gV8WP2YAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC,118,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2013/html/Henriques_Beyond_Hard_Negative_2013_ICCV_paper.html,14003285978325868654,/scholar?cites=14003285978325868654,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2013/papers/Henriques_Beyond_Hard_Negative_2013_ICCV_paper.pdf,0,0,0

In the process of embedding a secret message. a cover image is partitioned into non-overlapping blocks of two consecutive pixels. A difference value is calculated from the values of the two pixels in each block. All possible difference values are classified into a number of ranges. The selection of the range intervals is based on the characteristics of human vision’s sensitivity to gray value variations from smoothness to contrast. The difference value then is replaced by a new value to embed the value of a sub-stream of the secret message. The number of bits which can be embedded in a pixel pair is decided by the width of the range that the difference value belongs to.

1277070,Speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion,2002,Yongjian Yu and Scott T Acton,11,IEEE Transactions on image processing,11,1260-1270,IEEE,This paper provides the derivation of speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD). a diffusion method tailored to ultrasonic and radar imaging applications. SRAD is the edge-sensitive diffusion for speckled images. in the same way that conventional anisotropic diffusion is the edge-sensitive diffusion for images corrupted with additive noise. We first show that the Lee and Frost filters can be cast as partial differential equations. and then we derive SRAD by allowing edge-sensitive anisotropic diffusion within this context. Just as the Lee (1980. 1981. 1986) and Frost (1982) filters utilize the coefficient of variation in adaptive filtering. SRAD exploits the instantaneous coefficient of variation. which is shown to be a function of the local gradient magnitude and Laplacian operators.

Typical roadblocks to consistent performance include limited capture range. noise sensitivity. and poor convergence to concavities. This paper proposes a new external force for active contours. called vector field convolution (VFC). to address these problems. VFC is calculated by convolving the edge map generated from the image with the user-defined vector field kernel. We propose two structures for the magnitude function of the vector field kernel. and we provide an analytical method to estimate the parameter of the magnitude function. Mixed VFC is introduced to alleviate the possible leakage problem caused by choosing inappropriate parameters.

Through a multigrid V-cycle. the anisotropic diffusion equations are successively transferred to coarser grids and used in a coarse-to-fine error correction scheme. When a coarse grid with a trivial solution is reached. the coarse grid estimates of the residual error can be propagated to the original grid and used to refine the solution. The main benefits of the multigrid approach are rapid intraregion smoothing and reduction of artifacts due to the elimination of low-frequency error.

In this paper. our main contribution is a thinning paradigm from which we derive three algorithmic watershed cut strategies: The first one is well suited to parallel implementations. the second one leads to a flexible linear-time sequential implementation. whereas the third one links the watershed cuts and the popular flooding algorithms. We state that watershed cuts preserve a notion of contrast. called connection value. on which several morphological region merging methods are (implicitly) based. We also establish the links and differences between watershed cuts. minimum spanning forests. shortest path forests. and topological watersheds.

Iterative methods are normally used. and the solution is defined by ‘best fit’ in the sense of generalized least-squares.The inverse problems we describe are ill-posed. That is. small changes in the data can lead to large changes in both the solution and in the iterative process that finds the solution. Through an analysis of the problem. based on local linearization. we define a class of methods that stabilize the iteration. and provide a robust solution.

However. the utility of spatial data has been undermined by a lack of understanding of the nature and causes of observed spatial variation in images. One approach to this problem is to model the spatial variation in images as a function of ground scene and sensor parameters. Variograms are the tool used to link models of ground scenes to spatial variation in images. Explicit variograms are calculated for simple models of ground scenes consisting of randomly located discs on a continuous background.

Here. use of the system to provide field data and derived gap probabilities in the form of a ‘hemispherical photograph with range’ is demonstrated. The results show consistency and reproducibility and do not depend on special conditions for the natural light field.,True,C827KbAAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,251,https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article-abstract/29/2/171/1642428,1034750831994499057,/scholar?cites=1034750831994499057,,,https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article-pdf/29/2/171/4630880/tpn022.pdf,0,0,0
