1104984,Anomalous increase in carbon capacitance at pore sizes less than 1 nanometer,2006,John Chmiola and G Yushin and Yury Gogotsi and Christele Portet and Patrice Simon and Pierre-Louis Taberna,313,science,5794,1760-1763,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Carbon supercapacitors. which are energy storage devices that use ion adsorption on the surface of highly porous materials to store charge. have numerous advantages over other power-source technologies. but could realize further gains if their electrodes were properly optimized. Studying the effect of the pore size on capacitance could potentially improve performance by maximizing the electrode surface area accessible to electrolyte ions. but until recently. no studies had addressed the lower size limit of accessible pores. Using carbide-derived carbon. we generated pores with average sizes from 0.6 to 2.25 nanometer and studied double-layer capacitance in an organic electrolyte. The results challenge the long-held axiom that pores smaller than the size of solvated electrolyte ions are incapable of contributing to charge storage.,True,zr5Y2WwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3284,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5794/1760.abstract,714878569833763459,/scholar?cites=714878569833763459,,https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/2873/1/Chmiola_2873.pdf,0,0,0

However. many fundamental questions. such as the relations between the pore size of carbon electrodes. ion size of the electrolyte. and the capacitance have not yet been fully answered. We show that the pore size leading to the maximum double-layer capacitance of a TiC-derived carbon electrode in a solvent-free ethyl-methylimmidazolium-bis(trifluoro-methane-sulfonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI) ionic liquid is roughly equal to the ion size (∼0.7 nm).

There have been a few reports on thin-film and other micro-supercapacitors. but they are either too thin to provide sufficient energy or the technology is not scalable. By etching supercapacitor electrodes into conductive titanium carbide substrates. we demonstrate that monolithic carbon films lead to a volumetric capacity exceeding that of micro- and macroscale supercapacitors reported thus far. by a factor of 2.

Soft X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy demonstrated that CDC consisted mostly of sp2 bonded carbon. Small-angle X-ray scattering and argon sorption measurements showed that the uniform carbon-carbon distance in cubic TiC resulted in the formation of small pores with a narrow size distribution at low synthesis temperatures; synthesis temperatures above 800 °C resulted in larger pores.

While it is well known that high-temperature treatments of porous carbons can influence the microstructure. no systematic studies have been done on carbide-derived carbons. We show that vacuum annealing increases the pore volume and specific surface area of titanium carbide-derived carbon with no significant change in the pore size up to 1500 °C. This treatment produces porous carbons with subnanometer porosity and a specific surface area up to 2000 m2/g. while treating the samples at temperatures above 1600 °C increases the pore size above 1 nm because of graphitization and collapse of the micropore structure.

CDCs with controlled pore size between 0.6 and 1.1 nm were prepared and tested firstly in ACN+ NEt4BF4 electrolyte [3. 4]. We recently demonstrated that. defying the conventional wisdom stating that pores larger than the size of solvated ion (> 2nm) were needed to optimize the charge storage. sub-nanometer pores (< 1nm) lead to huge capacitance increase.

To reach this goal. the current trend is to fabricate micro-storage unit such as microbatteries (MB) or microsupercapacitors (MSC) at the wafer level. According to the limited surface of such device. the metrics should be reported as normalized to the footprint area (mF. µWh and mW per cm2). With such metrics. the average energy density of most of MSC1.2 (Onions like carbon. graphene) is found to be close to 1 µWh/cm2which is not enough to get autonomous miniaturized and connected sensors.

The problem requires drivers to provide pick-up and delivery services to customers. Its solution involves planning itineraries for buses and establishing working schedule for drivers. subject to vehicle capacity limitation and time constraints. The objective is to optimally schedule the fleet of vehicles for customer demand so as to reduce costs. This paper presents a complete constraint model for solving the problem. For vehicle routing. a permutation constraint is used to impose a total order for visiting all customer locations. which provides a global planning over all routes.

The study of the electrochemical behavior of graphene and Ti3C2 MXene (with three different functional groups) in five ionic liquids shows that the electrodes expand when charged negatively and no major dependence on the anion type is observed. When the electrode is positively charged. the volume changes are more complex and no specific trend could be observed depending on the anion size. The volume changes are in most cases. very well explained by the quantities of adsorbed ions.

Over the past decade. the performance of supercapacitors has greatly improved. as electrode materials have been tuned at the nanoscale and electrolytes have gained an active role. enabling more efficient storage mechanisms. In porous carbon materials with subnanometre pores. the desolvation of the ions leads to surprisingly high capacitances. Oxide materials store charge by surface redox reactions. leading to the pseudocapacitive effect.

Here we use scattering experiments to resolve the structure of a widely used ionic liquid (EMI–TFSI) when it is confined inside nanoporous carbons.

The simulations span a wide range of compositions. across which the fluidity of the system changes greatly due to the break-up of the Be−F network by the addition of the LiF. The relationship between the conductivity and viscosity passes from that expected for independently diffusing ions in the dilute mixtures to strongly decoupled Li+ migration through a viscous network at higher concentrations. The transition between these régimes is linked to the changing local and intermediate-scale structure in the melts. The decoupling phenomenon is associated with the appearance of migration channels in the network which leads to cooperative effects in the Li+ migration. ,True,ZnqXB7kAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,97,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp067073a,6040964533107843171,/scholar?cites=6040964533107843171,,https://www.phenix.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf/salanne2007b.pdf,0,0,0

This claim is based upon measurements of weak attractive forces between a mica surface and a gold surface across ILs. attributed to doublelayer attraction. From the decay length of the attractive force (10–13 nm). an effective free-ion concentration is deduced by fitting to a modified Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theoretical expression. However. the overwhelming evidence from the thermodynamic and transport properties of similar ILs is that they are not composed of neutral ion pairs with simple dissociation equilibria. and. as such. the DLVO framework is inappropriate.

To rationalize this dichotomy. we investigated the influence of the microscopic structure of the surface and the strength of adhesive (surface–water) interactions on surface hydrophobicity. We have shown that at low relative humidity. the competition between adhesion and the favorable entropy of being in the vapor phase determines the surface coverage.

For all concentrations tested. we find a linear variation of the droplet fluorescent intensity as a function of the droplet volume. For a given size and a given quantum dot (QD) concentration. the droplet fluorescence intensity drops sharply as a function of the magnetic nanoparticle concentration. We show that this decrease is due mainly to the strong absorption cross section of the magnetic nanoparticles and to a lesser extent to the dynamic and static quenching of the QD fluorescence.

We exploit the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the system size (Yeh and Hummer 2004 J. Phys. Chem. B 108 15873) to obtain the size-independent value. This also provides an estimate of the viscosity of all water models. which we compare to the Green–Kubo result. In all cases. a good agreement is found. The TIP4P/2005 model is in better agreement with the experimental data for both diffusion and viscosity.

Ceux-ci présentent un grand intérêt dans les applications de puissance puisqu'ils peuvent stocker et fournir de l'électricité rapidement (quelques secondes) grâce à un fonctionnement basé sur le stockage électrostatique des charges électriques : les ions d'un électrolyte sont adsorbés/désorbés à la surface de la matière active des électrodes. Les objectifs de cette thèse sont (1) d'étudier la charge de la double couche électrochimique. constituée par les ions de l'électrolyte et les charges induites par l'application d'un potentiel externe au niveau des électrodes. en vue d'augmenter la capacité et (2) de formuler des électrolytes à base de liquides ioniques dans le but d'augmenter la fenêtre de potentiel d'électrochimique. et donc l'énergie. Ces travaux de recherches ont été réalisés en partenariat avec la société industrielle Solvionic. spécialisée dans le développement et la production de liquides ioniques. et le laboratoire du CIRIMAT de l'université Paul Sabatier. Les résultats obtenus à l'issue de cette étude ont conduit à trois publications. dans lesquelles nous avons tout d'abord montré que la taille des pores de la matière active et la taille des ions de l'électrolyte doivent être adaptée pour augmenter la capacité. la capacité est maximale lorsque la taille des …,True,HsUxCjcAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,6,http://thesesups.ups-tlse.fr/1895,13090897342511836901,/scholar?cites=13090897342511836901,,http://thesesups.ups-tlse.fr/1895/1/2012TOU30274.pdf,0,0,0

1105235,Optical fibre sensor system for multipoint corrosion detection,2009,Joaquim F Martins-Filho and Eduardo Fontana,,,,,INTECH Open Access Publisher,Over the past thirty years there has been intense research and development on optical fibre sensors for many applications. basically because of their advantages over other technologies. such as immunity to electromagnetic interference. lightweight. small size. high sensitivity. large bandwidth. and ease in signal light transmission. The applications include sensing temperature. strain. pressure. current/voltage. chemical/gas. displacement. and biological processes among others. To accomplish those. different optical technologies have been employed such as fibre grating. interferometry. light scattering and reflectometry. Faraday rotation. luminescence and others. A review on fibre sensors can be found in (Lee. 2003). Corrosion and its effects have a profound impact on the infrastructure and equipment of countries worldwide. This impact is manifested in significant maintenance. repair. and replacement efforts; reduced access. availability and production; poor performance; high environmental risks; and unsafe conditions associated with facilities and equipment. There have been some efforts from different countries to estimate the cost of corrosion and the results indicate that it can reach 2 to 5% of the gross national product. For example. corrosion damage represented an estimated cost of US $276 billions in the United States of America in 2002 (Thompson et al.. 2005). Therefore. corrosion monitoring is an important aspect of modern infrastructure in industry sectors such as mining. aircraft. shipping. oilfields. as well as in military and civil facilities.

The low-voltage process is quite reversible over the 0.02 to 1.8 V range with a sustained capacity of about 150 mAh/g over a few hundred cycles. Within such a range of potential the polymer/gel-like is barely evolving while it vanishes as the oxidation potential is increased above 2 V. From the cyclic-voltammogram profiles we conclude that the origin of the low-voltage capacity is nested in the pseudocapacitive character of the in situ made polymeric/gel film.

The abundance and materials life‐cycle costs of such batteries may present issues in the long term with foreseeable large‐scale applications. To address the issue of sustainability of electrode materials. a radically different approach from the conventional route has been adopted to develop new organic electrode materials. The oxocarbon salt Li2C6O6 is synthesized through potentially low‐cost processes free of toxic solvents and by enlisting the use of natural organic sources (CO2‐harvesting entities).

For 250 years. the tremendous development of humanity has been founded on the harnessing of fossil fuels (coal. crude oil then natural gas) as primary energy due to their high energy density values and the easiness of access. However. this global pattern of energy supply and use is unsustainable. Global warming and finite fossil-fuel supplies call for a radical change in the energy mix to favour renewable energy sources. Without being exhaustive. we tackle in this article the tricky energy question and associated environmental issues as personally perceived. The eminent role of electric energy produced from decarbonized sources in a future sustainable economy is particularly highlighted as well as the issues of its needed storage.

The Smith's scale. defined in solids for acido-basic reactions involving species exchange. is successfully used to check that. among the numerous simple oxides. the basic ones such as MnO. FeO. CoO.

Besides the basicity criteria. we stressed that the nanometric character of the reduced composite electrode (eg. metallic nanoparticles immersed in a highly divided media) is a must to enable the reversible reactivity of metal oxides toward Li. Such a simple approach was finally implemented to other compounds (sulfides. nitrides. vanadates...) and the predictions confronted with experimental data.© 2002 The Electrochemical Society.

The applications of this transformative technology require synthesis routes capable of producing safe and easy-to-handle anode particles with low volume changes and stable performance during battery operation. Herein. we report a large-scale hierarchical bottom-up assembly route for the formation of Si on the nanoscale—containing rigid and robust spheres with irregular channels for rapid access of Li ions into the particle bulk. Large Si volume changes on Li insertion and extraction are accommodated by the particle’s internal porosity. Reversible capacities over five times higher than that of the state-of-the-art anodes (1.950 mA h g− 1) and stable performance are attained.

Si offers more than one order of magnitude higher capacity than graphite. but it exhibits dramatic volume changes during electrochemical alloying and de-alloying with Li. which typically leads to rapid anode degradation.

A reduction in crystal size also affects ND Raman spectra. The confinement of optical phonons in nanocrystals (< 10 nm) results in asymmetrically broadened Raman lines. which are shifted toward lower wavenumbers. The phonon confinement model (PCM) relates the observed changes in the Raman spectra to the crystal size and can be used for size characterization at the nanoscale. While the PCM was successfully applied to a variety of materials including Si and BN. results remained unsatisfactory in the case of ND. In order to improve the agreement between the predictions of the model and experimental Raman spectra of ND. effects such as crystal size distribution. lattice defects. and the energy dispersion of the phonon modes were taken into consideration and incorporated into …,True,eh_0cyMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,182,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.80.075419,5391055351060529009,/scholar?cites=5391055351060529009,,https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3181&context=chem_facwork,0,0,0

K+. Mg2+. Ca2+. and Al3+) batteries have attracted great attention as emerging low-cost and high energy-density technologies for large-scale renewable energy storage applications. However. the development of these batteries is hindered by the limited choice of high-performance electrode materials. In this work. MXene nanosheets. a class of two-dimensional transition-metal carbides. are predicted to serve as high-performing anodes for non-lithium-ion batteries by combined first-principles simulations and experimental measurements. Both O-terminated and bare MXenes are shown to be promising anode materials with high capacities and good rate capabilities. while bare MXenes show better performance.

Because the ionic radius of Na+ is smaller than that of HPO42–. the symmetric expansion suggests that divalent anions do not completely desorb during electrode regeneration. causing the adverse interactions with the cation during co-ion expulsion.

1105431,Small-gain theorem for ISS systems and applications,1994,Z-P Jiang and Andrew R Teel and Laurent Praly,7,"Mathematics of Control, Signals and Systems",2,95-120,Springer-Verlag,We introduce a concept of input-to-output practical stability (IOpS) which is a natural generalization of input-to-state stability proposed by Sontag. It allows us to establish two important results. The first one states that the general interconnection of two IOpS systems is again an IOpS system if an appropriate composition of the gain functions is smaller than the identity function. The second one shows an example of gain function assignment by feedback. As an illustration of the interest of these results. we address the problem of global asymptotic stabilization via partial-state feedback for linear systems with nonlinear. stable dynamic perturbations and for systems which have a particular disturbed recurrent structure.,True,COrhJXcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1296,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01211469,9924929238655341002,/scholar?cites=9924929238655341002,,http://cas.ensmp.fr/~praly/Telechargement/Journaux/1994-MCSS-Jiang-Teel-Praly.pdf,0,0,0

1105434,Design of robust adaptive controllers for nonlinear systems with dynamic uncertainties,1998,Zhong-Ping Jiang and Laurent Praly,34,Automatica,7,825-840,Pergamon,In this paper. a modified adaptive backstepping design procedure is proposed for a class of nonlinear systems with three types of uncertainty: (i) unknown parameters; (ii) uncertain nonlinearities and (iii) unmodeled dynamics. Nonlinear damping terms are used to counteract the uncertain nonlinear functions and a dynamic signal is introduced to dominate the dynamic disturbance.

Two sufficient conditions with or without continuous communication between neighboring agents are presented to guarantee the consensus. The advantage of the event-based strategy is the significant decrease of the number of controller updates for cooperative tasks of multi-agent systems involving embedded microprocessors with limited on-board resources. The controller updates of each agent are driven by properly defined events. which depend on the measurement error. the states of its neighboring agents and an arbitrarily small threshold.

The objective is to design a robust nonlinear state and output feedback law which simultaneously solves the global exponential regulation problem for all plants in the class. A switching control strategy is employed to get around the smooth stabilization burden associated with nonholonomic systems. The systematic strategy involves the introduction of a state-scaling technique and the application of the so-called integrator backstepping procedure.

The use of small-gain techniques permits removal of a common restriction. i.e. that the nonlinearities in the system are only dependent on the measured output. The design procedure is divided into two parts. In the first part. based on a partial-state observer. integrator backstepping is used to design an adaptive output-feedback controller which ensures robustness with respect to unknown parameters and uncertain nonlinearities. In the second part. it is shown that the adaptive controller can be made robust against dynamic uncertainties by means of recent nonlinear small-gain results.,True,COrhJXcAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,251,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109899000151,14220161071277786546,/scholar?cites=14220161071277786546,,,0,0,0

These requirements are simulated and compared for the study cases with and without wind generation impacts included into the study for the years 2006 and 2010. Regulation and load following models were built based on hour-ahead and five-minute ahead load and wind generation forecasts. In 2006. the CAISO system peaked at 50 270 MW. Wind generation (at the installed capacity of 2600 MW) had limited impact on the requirement of load following and regulation in the CAISO Balancing Authority.

Depending on the economic considerations. energy storage can be a viable solution to balance energy production with consumption. This paper proposes to use discrete Fourier transform to decompose the required balancing power into different time-varying periodic components. i.e.. intraweek. intraday. intrahour. and real-time. Each component can be used to quantify the maximum energy storage requirement for different types of energy storage.

Richland. WA (United States),Fast responsive regulation resources are potentially more valuable as a power system regulation resource (more efficient) because they allow applying controls at the exact moment and in the exact amount as needed. Faster control is desirable because it facilitates more reliable compliance with the NERC Control Performance Standards at relatively lesser regulation capacity procurements. The current California ISO practices and markets do not provide a differentiation among the regulation resources based on their speed of response (with the exception of some minimum ramping capabilities). Some demand response technologies. including some generation and energy storage resources. can provide quicker control actions. California ISO practices and markets could be updated to welcome more fast regulation resources into the California ISO service area. The project work reported in this work was pursuing the following objectives:• Develop methodology to assess the relative value of generation resources used for regulation and load following California ISO functions• This assessment should be done based on physical characteristics including the ability to quickly change their output following California ISO signals• Evaluate what power is worth on different time scales• Analyze the benefits of new regulation resources to provide effective compliance with the mandatory NERC more»,True,GXc0FJoAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,137,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/946001,6484469538414213018,/scholar?cites=6484469538414213018,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/946001,0,0,0

1105481,A continuation method approach to finding the closest saddle node bifurcation point,1994,Yuri V Makarov and Ian A Hiskens,,"Proc. NSF/ECC Workshop on Bulk Power System Voltage Phenomena III, Davos, Switzerland",,,,The paper considers the problem of nding saddle node bifurcation points which are closest (in a local sense) to the power system operating point. This optimization problem leads to a set of equations which describe such critical points. Not all solutions of this set of equations are critical points. The paper therefore explores the nature and characteristics of solutions. A two stage algorithm is proposed for solving the critical point problem. The rst stage is simply to nd a point on the singular surface. ie. the surface of saddle node bifurcation points. which lies is a speci ed direction. The second stage uses a continuation method to move from that initial point to the desired critical point. Singularity of the critical point problem can have a signi cant in uence on the robustness of the continuation method. The paper investigates singularity conditions.

(2) What kinds of controllers may be designed to ensure the network synchronization? (3) How large should the coupling strength be used in a given complex network to achieve synchronization? This paper addresses these technique questions. Surprisingly. it is found that a network under a typical framework can realize synchronization subject to any linear feedback pinning scheme by using adaptive tuning of the coupling strength. In addition. it is found that the nodes with low degrees should be pinned first when the coupling strength is small. which is contrary to the common view that the most-highly-connected nodes should be pinned first.

1105506,Structure identification of uncertain general complex dynamical networks with time delay,2009,Hui Liu and Jun-An Lu and Jinhu Lü and David J Hill,45,Automatica,8,1799-1807,Pergamon,It is well known that many real-world complex networks have various uncertain information. such as unknown or uncertain topological structure and node dynamics. The structure identification problem has theoretical and practical importance for uncertain complex dynamical networks. At the same time. time delay often appears in the state variables or coupling coefficients of various practical complex networks. This paper initiates a novel approach for simultaneously identifying the topological structure and unknown parameters of uncertain general complex networks with time delay. In particular. this method is also effective for uncertain delayed complex dynamical networks with different node dynamics.

Synchronization is a typical collective behavior of complex networks that has been extensively investigated in recent years. To reveal the dynamical mechanism of synchronization in complex networks with time delays. a general complex dynamical network with delayed nodes is further studied. Based on a suitable model. we investigate the adaptive feedback synchronization and obtain several novel criteria for globally exponentially asymptotic synchronization.

1105509,Putting energy back in control,2001,Romeo Ortega and Arjan J Van Der Schaft and Iven Mareels and Bernhard Maschke,21,IEEE Control Systems Magazine,2,18-33,IEEE,Energy is one of the fundamental concepts in science and engineering practice. where it is common to view dynamical systems as energy-transformation devices. This perspective is particularly useful in studying complex nonlinear systems by decomposing them into simpler subsystems that. upon interconnection. add up their energies to determine the full system's behavior. The action of a controller may also be understood in energy terms as another dynamical system. The control problem can then be recast as finding a dynamical system and an interconnection pattern such that the overall energy function takes the desired form. This energy-shaping approach is the essence of passivity-based control (PBC). a controller design technique that is very well known in mechanical systems. Our objectives in the article are threefold.

1105513,On non-local stability properties of extremum seeking control,2006,Ying Tan and Dragan Nešić and Iven Mareels,42,Automatica,6,889-903,Pergamon,In this paper. we consider several extremum seeking schemes and show under appropriate conditions that these schemes achieve extremum seeking from an arbitrarily large domain of initial conditions if the parameters in the controller are appropriately adjusted. This non-local stability result is proved by showing semi-global practical stability of the closed-loop system with respect to the design parameters. We show that reducing the size of the parameters typically slows down the convergence rate of the extremum seeking controllers and enlarges the domain of the attraction. Our results provide guidelines on how to tune the controller parameters in order to achieve extremum seeking.

1105514,Topological feedback entropy and nonlinear stabilization,2004,Girish N Nair and Robin J Evans and Iven MY Mareels and William Moran,49,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,9,1585-1597,IEEE,It is well known in the field of dynamical systems that entropy can be defined rigorously for completely deterministic open-loop systems. However. such definitions have found limited application in engineering. unlike Shannon's statistical entropy. In this paper. it is shown that the problem of communication-limited stabilization is related to the concept of topological entropy. introduced by Adler et al. as a measure of the information rate of a continuous map on a compact topological space. Using similar open cover techniques. the notion of topological feedback entropy (TFE) is defined in this paper and proposed as a measure of the inherent rate at which a map on a noncompact topological space with inputs generates stability information. It is then proven that a topological dynamical plant can be stabilized into a compact set if and only if the data rate in the feedback loop exceeds the TFE of the plant on the set.

Because extremum seeking is model free. it has proven to be both robust and effective in many different application domains. Equally being model free. there are clear limitations to what can be achieved. Perhaps paradoxically. although being model free. extremum seeking is a gradient based optimization technique. Extremum seeking relies on an appropriate exploration of the process to be optimized to provide the user with an approximate gradient. and hence the means to locate an extremum. These observations are elucidated in the paper.

Through the introduction of a novel Lyapunov-like function. the proposed method only requires the system to start from where it stopped at the last cycle. and avoids the strict requirement for initial repositioning for all the cycles. In addition. it is more applicable. as it only requires the variables to be learned in an iteration-independent manner. rather than satisfying the periodicity requirement in a number of the conventional methods. With the adoption of fully saturated learning. all the signals in the closed loop are guaranteed to be bounded. and the iterative trajectories are proven to follow the profiles of desired trajectories over the entire operation interval.

Its application to real data shows that it is able to distinguish effectively between stable and unstable dynamics. A computational model is then used to investigate stability in human arm movements. which takes into account motor output variability and computes the force to perform a task according to an inverse dynamics model. Simulation results suggest that even a large time delay does not affect movement stability as long as the reflex feedback is small relative to muscle elasticity. Simulations are also used to …,True,AcMU308AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,169,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-005-0025-9,11563675091851953684,/scholar?cites=11563675091851953684,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iven_Mareels/publication/220450468_Stability_and_motor_adaptation_in_human_arm_movements/links/0fcfd50f7b59b6fff2000000/Stability-and-motor-adaptation-in-human-arm-movements.pdf,0,0,0
1105529,On the choice of dither in extremum seeking systems: A case study,2008,Ying Tan and Dragan Nešić and Iven Mareels,44,Automatica,5,1446-1450,Pergamon,We discuss how the choice of dither (excitation signal) affects the performance of extremum seeking using a benchmark situation: a static scalar map; and a simple scalar extremum seeking scheme. Our comparisons are based on the performance of the system with different dithers in terms of three performance indicators: the speed of convergence. domain of attraction and accuracy (i.e. the ultimate bound on trajectories). Our analysis explicitly shows how the dither shape affects each of these performance indicators. Our study suggests that the practitioners using extremum seeking control should consider the dither shape as an important design parameter. Computer simulations support our theoretical findings.,True,AcMU308AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,148,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109807004633,4507910564638938359,/scholar?cites=4507910564638938359,,ftp://labattmot.ele.ita.br/ele/samuel/Leitura/Choice_Dither_Extremum_Control.pdf,0,0,0

When the number of nonzero tap coefficients m is small compared with the delay horizon n. the performance of the LMS estimator is greatly enhanced when this specific structure is exploited. We propose a consistent algorithm that performs identification of nonzero taps only. The results are illustrated via a simulation study.,True,AcMU308AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,140,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/720368/,14328341394798511789,/scholar?cites=14328341394798511789,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iven_Mareels/publication/3316972_LMS_Estimation_via_Structural_Detection/links/00b7d52eec6722c7b6000000/LMS-Estimation-via-Structural-Detection.pdf,0,0,0
1105532,Non-linear dynamics in adaptive control: chaotic and periodic stabilization,1986,Iven MY Mareels and Robert R Bitmead,22,Automatica,6,641-655,Pergamon,In this paper the non-linear features of adaptive control algorithms are highlighted. Using a simple “linear” discrete time example. based on classical design. it is demonstrated that in the presence of undermodelling errors. non-linear phenomena in the feedback gain such as limit cycles and even chaos arise. Despite these complicated dynamics. robust stabilization of the plant can still occur. For the class of undermodelling errors considered. the set of plants stabilizable by this adaptive controller is completely characterized.,True,AcMU308AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,139,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0005109886900038,3320059944744486534,/scholar?cites=3320059944744486534,,,0,0,0

In particular. for induction motors. indirect fieldoriented control is a simple and highly reliable scheme which has become the de facto industry standard. In spite of its widespread popularity no rigorous stability proof for this controller was available in the literature. In a recent paper (Ortega et al. 1995) [Ortega. R.. D. Taoutaou. R. Rabinovici and J. P. Vilain (1995). On field oriented and passivity-based control of induction motors: downward compatibility. In Proc. IFAC NOLCOS Conf.. Tahoe City.

A typical teleoperator system consists of master and slave manipulators and a communication channel between them. The master is moved by the human operator. and the slave is programmed to follow the motion of the master. In bilateral or force-reflecting teleoperators. a signal from the slave side is transmitted through the communication channel to the master. which provides the human operator with information about the contact forces experienced by the slave. To obtain such a force reflection. different combinations of the position and force measurements can be used.

In cross-validating LS-SVM or KRR. the training examples are split into two distinct subsets for a number of times (l) wherein a subset of m examples are used for validation and the other subset of (n-m) examples are used for training the classifier. In this case l linear systems of dimension (n-m) need to be solved. We propose a novel method for cross-validation (CV) of LS-SVM or KRR in which instead of solving l linear systems of dimension (n-m). we compute the inverse of an n dimensional square matrix and solve l linear systems of dimension m. thereby reducing the complexity when l is large and/or m is small.

A major drawback of ESS is that its computational complexity varies widely from O(n 2 ) to O(n 4 ) for n × n matrices. Our experimental experience shows that the ESS's performance is highly related to the optimal confidence levels which indicate the probability of the object's presence. In particular. when the object is not in the image. the optimal subwindow scores low and ESS may take a large amount of iterations to converge to the optimal solution and so perform very slow.

In order to solve the inpainting problem for color texture images effectively. we propose a non-local Color Total Variation model. This model is different from the recently proposed non-local Mumford–Shah model (NL-MS). Technically. the proposed model is an extension of local TV model for gray images but we take account of the relationship between different channels in color images and make use of concepts of the non-local operators. We will analyze how the coupling of different channels of color images in the proposed model makes the problem difficult for numerical implementation with the conventional split Bregman algorithm.

Exploiting side information. we develop algorithms to preserve both the intra-class and inter-class local structures. This new type of locality preserving projection (LPP). called LPP with side information (LPPSI). preserves the datapsilas local structure in the sense that the close. similar training patterns will be kept close. whilst the close but dissimilar ones are separated. Our algorithms balance these conflicting requirements. and we further improve this technique using kernel methods.

Zeng,82,ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics,12,18,asme,This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation into the dynamic response of three-dimensional (3D) orthogonal woven carbon composites undergoing soft impact. Composite beams of two different fiber architectures. varying only by the density of through-thickness reinforcement. were centrally impacted by metallic foam projectiles. Using high-speed photography. the center-point back-face deflection was measured as a function of projectile impulse. Qualitative comparisons are made with a similar unidirectional (UD) laminate material.

The corrugated core was manufactured from unidirectional carbon fibre pre-impregnated lamina wrapped around destructible triangular prisms. Individual wrapped triangular composite cores of relative density ρ¯≈ 0.13 are cut from the sandwich beams and tested under both quasi-static compression and dynamic compression at a strain rate up to 8200 s− 1 using an instrumented direct impact Kolsky bar experiment. Under quasi-static compressive test. as the cores were provided with no lateral confinement. the failure mechanism of the composite core was that of progressive unwrapping of cores due to matrix cracking at the joints of the core webs. Under the dynamic compressive tests. the composite cores demonstrated rate-dependent behaviour.

The optimization aims to find the minimum weight/volume solution under the constraints of allowable node displacements. The design optimization is a formulation of mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPECs). To overcome the numerical difficulties of the complementary constraints in optimization. an iteration process. comprising a quadratic programming (QP) and an updating process. is employed as the optimization method. Furthermore. the elasto-plastic buckling of truss members is considered as a constraint in design optimization. A combinational optimization strategy is proposed for the displacement constraints and the buckling constraint. which comprises the method mentioned above and an optimal criterion.

Upon loading. the pins deform predominantly by local stretching whilst the deformation of foam is governed by local bending. This paper presents a theoretical study on the thermoelasticity of pin-reinforced foam sandwich cores. To calculate the effective thermoelastic properties of pin-reinforced foam cores. the energy-based homogenization approach is employed to develop a micromechanicsbased model. calibrated by the existing experimental data. It is found that the stiffness of the sandwich core is mainly governed by pin reinforcements: the foam matrix contributes little to sandwich stiffness.

The buffer plate is either resting on (unattached) or attached to a rigid stationary foundation. The lumped parameter model is used to construct maps of the regimes of behaviour with axes of the ratio of the height of the sand slug to core thickness and the normalised core strength. Four regimes of behaviour are identified based on whether the core compression ends prior to the densification of the sand slug or vice versa. Coupled discrete/continuum simulations are also reported and compared with the lumped parameter model.

Whereas the top-down fabrication of such structures remains a technological challenge. their bottom-up fabrication through self-assembly is a potentially more powerful strategy.

An amorphous silicon nitride layer is formed in the initial stage of growth that prevents the formation of a GaN wetting layer. The nucleation time was found to be strongly influenced by the substrate temperature and was more than 30 min for the applied growth conditions. The observed tapering and reduced length of silicon-doped nanorods is explained by enhanced nucleation on nonpolar facets and proves Ga-adatom diffusion on nanorod sidewalls as one contribution to the axial growth. The presence of Mg leads to an increased radial growth rate with a simultaneous decrease of the nanorod length and reduces the nucleation time for high Mg concentrations.,True,6x6yJQkAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,172,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2953087,12797620336816750357,/scholar?cites=12797620336816750357,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Eickhoff/publication/224444033_Nucleation_and_growth_of_GaN_nanorods_on_Si_111_surfaces_by_plasma-assisted_molecular_beam_epitaxy_-_The_influence_of_Si-_and_Mg-doping/links/0c96052c2d6d984707000000.pdf,0,0,0

Our results demonstrate that the electrical transport in these nanomaterials is influenced by the surface in two different ways. On the one hand. the effective mobility and the density of free carriers are determined by recombination mechanisms assisted by the oxidizing molecules in air. This phenomenon can also be blocked by surface passivation. On the other hand. the surface built-in potential separates the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and accumulates holes at the surface. After illumination. the charge separation makes the electron–hole recombination difficult and originates PPC.

The obtained BiVO4 is. among the others. the most promising photocatalyst for this reaction. displaying higher CH3OH selectivity and being more stable than the others. When Bi2WO6 was coupled with TiO2. the methane conversion increased; however. overoxidation of CH4 to CO2 predominates. A similar effect is observed when electron scavengers such as O2 or Fe3+ were introduced in the photoreactor as a result of the formation of highly oxidant radicals.,True,h5HUPMsAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC,61,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cs500821r,9265644578006876890,/scholar?cites=9265644578006876890,,,0,0,0
1105769,An insight on the role of La in mesoporous WO 3 for the photocatalytic conversion of methane into methanol,2016,Katherine Villa and Sebastián Murcia-López and Joan Ramón Morante and Teresa Andreu,187,Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,,30-36,Elsevier,One of the great challenges in the photocatalytic oxidation of methane into methanol is to find a suitable catalyst that allows an increase in the selectivity without diminishing the total conversion. since the main feature that rules the yield of this reaction is the overoxidation to CO2. Ordered mesoporous metal oxides show large surface area and good light harvesting. resulting in efficient catalysts for many photocatalytic applications. With this in mind. a new highly active photocatalyst. La doped mesoporous WO3. was examined. The production of methanol over WO3/La was approximately 2 times higher than that of pure WO3 while the CO2 rates were significantly decreased. resulting in higher methanol selectivity. This improvement was mainly due to lanthanum contributing to maintaining the mesoporous structure during calcination treatment and increasing the generation of OH groups on the surface of WO3.

A photocurrent of 2.4 mA/cm2 (60% of the optical maximum for a 2.7 eV gap material) was obtained for films as thick as 18 μm. FE-SEM images revealed that WO3 films were actually formed by an array of oriented columns. Efficient hole extraction toward the electrolyte was observed and attributed to a possible accommodation of the electrolyte between the WO3 columns. even for relatively compact films. This feature. combined with the detailed optical absorption and IPCE characterization. allowed us to implement a double-stack configuration of WO3 photoanodes which resulted in a remarkable photocurrent density of 3.1 mA cm−2 with 1 sun AM1.5 G illumination in 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte.

The effects of the applied potential and the concentration of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) on the morphology. structural and optoelectronic properties of the ZnO:Cl NWs were comprehensively investigated. The amount of Cl ions introduced in the ZnO structure increased almost linearly with both the concentration of NH4Cl in solution. and the electrodeposition potential. As side-effects. the presence of NH4Cl in the growth solution slowed down the electrodeposition rate and resulted in closer packed and lower aspect ratio NWs. but having a higher degree of vertical alignment and less defective surfaces.

A physical model has been proposed to reveal the role of each fundamental interfacial property on the observed behavior. On the one hand. by tuning the Fermi level position. charge separation was optimized by adjusting the depletion region width to maximize the potential drop inside titanium dioxide and also filling the surface states. which in turn decreased electron–hole recombination.

Using a combination of quantitative in situ compression in a transmission electron microscope and finite-element analysis. we show that the mechanical properties of nanoparticles can be directly measured and interpreted on an individual basis. We find that nanocrystalline CdS synthesized into a spherical shell geometry is capable of withstanding extreme stresses (approaching the ideal shear strength of CdS). This unusual strength enables the spherical shells to exhibit considerable deformation to failure (up to 20% of the sphere’s diameter). By taking into account the structural hierarchy intrinsic to novel nanocrystalline materials such as this. we show it is possible to achieve and characterize the ultrahigh stresses …,True,OoS8ca0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,219,https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat2295,4948600539076561364,/scholar?cites=4948600539076561364,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.363.2474&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In the present work. we developed a new method to efficiently coat CsPbX3 NCs. which resulted in their increased chemical and optical stability as well as processability. The method is based on the incorporation of poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMA) into the synthesis of the perovskite NCs. The presence of PMA in the ligand shell stabilizes the NCs by tightening the ligand binding. limiting in this way the NC surface interaction with the surrounding media.

On the one hand. the effective mobility and the density of free carriers are determined by recombination mechanisms assisted by the oxidizing molecules in air. This phenomenon can also be blocked by surface passivation. On the other hand. the surface built-in potential separates the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and accumulates holes at the surface.

By avoiding the use of a hydrothermal synthesis the integrity of the sensor is better preserved. and the resulting non-continuous zeolite film has the added advantage of a strong reduction in response times.,True,o6N2URgAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,61,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400508001871,1565238549193920246,/scholar?cites=1565238549193920246,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Albert_Cirera/publication/239348913_Development_and_application_of_micromachined_PdSnO_2_gas_sensors_with_zeolite_coatings/links/5d7b4c45a6fdcc2f0f6038bb/Development-and-application-of-micromachined-Pd-SnO-2-gas-sensors-with-zeolite-coatings.pdf,0,0,0

The proposed method is based on the layout optimization to minimize the series resistance of the inductor coil. taking into account both ohmic losses. due to conduction currents. and magnetically induced losses. due to eddy currents. The technique is particularly useful when applied to inductors in which the fabrication process includes integration substrate removal. However. it is also applicable to inductors on low-loss substrates. The method optimizes the width of the metal strip for each turn of the inductor coil. leading to a variable strip-width layout.

Currents strategies for cancer diagnosis consist of the extraction of a solid tissue from the affected area. This sample enables the study of specific biomarkers and the genetic nature of the tumor. However. the tissue extraction is risky and painful for the patient and in some cases is unavailable in inaccessible tumors. Moreover. a solid biopsy is expensive and time consuming and cannot be applied repeatedly. New alternatives that overcome these drawbacks are rising up nowadays. such as liquid biopsy. A liquid biopsy is the analysis of biomarkers in a non-solid biological tissue. mainly blood. which has remarkable advantages over the traditional method; it has no risk. it is non-invasive and painless. it does not require surgery and reduces cost and diagnosis time. The most studied cancer non-invasive biomarkers are circulating tumor cells (CTCs). circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). and exosomes. These circulating biomarkers play a key role in the understanding of metastasis and tumorigenesis. which could provide a better insight into the evolution of the tumor dynamics during treatment and disease progression. Improvements in isolation technologies. based on a higher grade of purification of CTCs. exosomes. and ctDNA. will provide a better characterization of biomarkers and give rise to a wide range of clinical applications. such as early detection of diseases. and the prediction of treatment responses due to the discovery of personalized tumor-related biomarkers.

High operating temperatures put numerous requirements on materials selection and on secondary units. limiting the commercial development of SOFCs. The present review first focuses on the main effects of reducing the operating temperature in terms of materials stability. thermo-mechanical mismatch. thermal management and efficiency. After a brief survey of the state-of-the-art materials for SOFCs. attention is focused on emerging oxide-ionic conductors with high conductivity in the intermediate range of temperatures with an introductory section on materials technology for reducing the electrolyte thickness. Finally. recent advances in cathode materials based on layered mixed ionic-electronic conductors are highlighted because the decreasing temperature converts the cathode into the major source of electrical losses for the whole SOFC system.

Replacing metallic based electrodes by pure oxides is therefore proposed as an advantage for the industrial application of solid oxide electrolyzers.

They originate from the presence of a high supersaturation of “excess” Si self-interstitial atoms located just beneath the c/a interface. Upon annealing. the mean radius of the defects increases while their density decreases through the exchange of Si self-interstitial atoms between the loops. The number of interstitials stored in the loops stays constant.

Knowing the type and origin of these defects allows one to understand why and how they affect dopant diffusion. Hence. it is possible to find out under which experimental conditions their density can be minimized and most importantly to develop physical models for dopant diffusion taking into account the behaviour of EOR defects during annealing. Indeed. these dislocations loops are efficient trapping sites for boron and this cannot be neglected in realistic simulations. Upon annealing. these defects increase in size and reduce their density and this through the emission and capture of Si interstitials. Thus. EOR defects can be seen as reservoirs able to maintain a high supersaturation of free self-interstitials during their dissolution.

The highest response was reached using a blue LED (465 nm) activation.

In the last decade the specific demand for gas detection and monitoring has emerged particularly as the awareness of the need to protect the environment has grown. Gas sensors find applications in numerous fields [1. 2]. Two important groups of applications are the detection of single gases (as NOx. NH3. O3. CO. CH4. H2. SO2. etc.) and the discrimination of odours or generally the monitoring of changes in the ambient. Single gas sensors can. for examples. be used as fire detectors. leakage detectors. controllers of ventilation in cars and planes. alarm devices warning the overcoming of threshold concentration values of hazardous gases in the work places. The detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or smells generated from food or household products has also become increasingly important in food industry and in indoor air quality. and multisensor systems (often referred to as electronic noses) are the modern gas sensing devices designed to analyse such complex environmental mixtures [3-5]. In Table 1 examples of application for gas sensors and electronic noses are reported. Solid state gas sensors. based on a variety of principles and materials. are the best candidates to the development of commercial gas sensors for a wide range of such applications [6-10].

The presence of these phases is favored by the Zn-rich and Cu-poor conditions that are required to obtain device-grade layers. We have developed a selective chemical etching process based on the use of hydrochloric acid solutions to remove Zn-rich secondary phases from the CZTS film surface. which are partly responsible for the deterioration of the series resistance of the cells and. as a consequence. the conversion efficiency. Using this approach. we have obtained CZTS-based devices with 5.2% efficiency. which is nearly twice that of the devices we have prepared without this etching process.,True,U-BjzJgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,271,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja301373e,4255988162298767768,/scholar?cites=4255988162298767768,,https://www.academia.edu/download/37437786/Articulo_1.pdf,0,0,0

Raman microprobe measurements performed directly on the substrate surface after mechanical removal of the absorber layer indicate the occurrence of a decomposition reaction of Cu2ZnSnSe4 in contact with the Mo substrate. This leads to a significant degradation of the quality of the absorber/back contact interface. with the formation of a high density of voids.

This disorder in the Cu and Zn sublattices may initiate a change of the crystal symmetry from kesterite‐type (Ī4) to (Ī42m) space group. The investigated CZTS crystals grown at high temperature are characterised by the co‐existence of regions with different composition ratio of Cu/(Zn+ Sn) which results in kesterite and disordered kesterite phases. The presence of a disordered phase with Ī42m symmetry is reflected in the appearance of a dominant broadened A‐symmetry peak at lower frequency than the peak of the main A‐symmetry kesterite mode at 337 cm–1.

Interpretation of the experimentally obtained spectra required the development of a modified model that includes additional features such as lattice strain. The model has been systematically applied for the simultaneous fitting of the two main A symmetry Raman peaks in the experimental spectra. The experimental data show that the line shape of the Raman peaks is determined mainly by phonon confinement effects. while their frequency is also sensitive to the presence of strain in the lattice. Simultaneous modeling of the A dominant peaks allows a quantitative estimation of the frequency strain shift that has been correlated with the strain measured by X-ray diffraction …,True,U-BjzJgAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,104,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645414001281,17391629129620494041,/scholar?cites=17391629129620494041,,,0,0,0

This highlights the importance to elucidate the mechanisms by which Ge improves the kesterite solar cells properties to such a large extent. In this contribution. we first show how controlling the position and thickness of a very thin (10–15 nm) layer of Ge greatly influences the crystallization of kesterite thin films prepared in a sequential process. Typically. Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) films form in a bi-layer structure with large grains in the upper region and small grains at the back.

Focusing in the preparation of iron oxide nanoparticles of comparable sizes. we have analyzed the performance of microwave-assisted synthesized nanoparticles compared to those obtained by the widespread thermal decomposition process of metal complexes. On the basis of a multidisciplinary experimental approach. we have unveiled that microwave-synthesized nanoparticles exhibit a surface reactivity significantly smaller than their thermal decomposition counterparts.

Ga-assisted growth of GaAs nanowires in the form of array has been shown to be challenging and difficult to reproduce.

The energy needed for this process is usually provided by heat. light. pressure or electrical potential. which act either by changing the distribution of the reactants on their ground-state potential energy surface or by moving them onto an excited-state potential energy surface and thereby facilitate movement over the energy barrier. A fundamentally different way of initiating or accelerating a reaction is the use of force to deform reacting molecules along a specific direction of the reaction coordinate. Mechanical force has indeed been shown to activate covalent bonds in polymers. but the usual result is chain scission 1.

Epoxy-based thermosets are used in a large variety of structural composites for various applications including aerospace. automotive. and electronics among others. 1 These materials experience stresses through normal use. which can lead to cracking of the epoxy resin. 2 Microcracks are often contained deep within a structural component and are difficult to detect.

In contrast to a materials science approach. Hyer emphasizes the micromechanics of stress and deformation for composite material analysis. The book provides invaluable analytic tools for students and engineers seeking to understand composite properties and failure limits. A key feature is a series of analytic problems continuing throughout the text. starting from relatively simple problems. which are built up step-by-step with accompanying calculations.

The book shows how thermally induced stresses and strains due to curing. add to or subtract from those due to applied loads. Another important element. and one unique to this book. is an emphasis on the difference between specifying the applied loads. ie. force and moment results. often the case in practice. versus specifying strains and curvatures and determining the subsequent stresses and force and moment results.

These epoxy-based materials contain embedded Grubbs' catalyst particles and microencapsulated dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). Autonomic repair is triggered by rupture of the microcapsules in response to damage. followed by release of DCPD into the crack plane where it mixes with the catalyst and polymerizes. The amount of liquid that microcapsules deliver to a crack face is shown to scale linearly with microcapsule diameter for a given weight fraction of capsules. In addition. self-healing performance reaches maximum levels only when sufficient healing agent is available to entirely fill the crack.

Epoxy-based thermosets are used in a large variety of structural composites for various applications including aerospace. automotive. and electronics among others. 1 These materials experience stresses through normal use. which can lead to cracking of the epoxy resin. 2 Microcracks are often contained deep within a structural component and are difficult to detect. If crack propagation continues. it can eventually lead to mechanical failure of the material.

The textures are of size 28–257 μm on stainless steel surfaces. fabricated using micro-casting. Friction characteristics of these surfaces were tested under submerged conditions using a pin-on-disk configuration. Numerical simulations solved the Navier–Stokes equations to predict the texture-induced lift. During hydrodynamic lubricated sliding. the textured surfaces exhibit friction as much as 80% lower than the untextured surfaces.

In many ways. the distinction between mixtures and pure substances lies at the root of the historical separation of organic and polymer chemistry.

The polymer was grafted from the surface of a self-assembled monolayer containing the initiator (BrC(CH3)2COO(CH2)11S)2. using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization. Varying the reaction time and monomer concentration controlled the molecular weight. and diluting the initiator in the monolayer altered the grafting density. Surface force measurements of the polymer films showed that the chain collapse above the LCST decreases with decreasing grafting density and molecular weight. At T > LCST. the advancing water contact angle increases sharply on PNIPAM films of high molecular weight and grafting density. but the change is less pronounced with films of …,True,xUm3bQkAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,415,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la0531502,16545549546658339742,/scholar?cites=16545549546658339742,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33586770/Plunket_Langmuir_2006.pdf,0,0,0

However. a static magnetic field along the propagation direction can break the time-reversal symmetry in the presence of magneto-optical materials. The Faraday effect in magneto-optical materials rotates the polarization plane of light. and when light travels backward the polarization is further rotated. This is applied in optical isolators. which are of crucial importance in optical systems. Faraday isolators are typically bulky due to the weak Faraday effect of available magneto-optical materials. The growing research endeavour in integrated optics demands thin-film Faraday rotators and enhancement of the Faraday effect. Here. we report significant enhancement of Faraday rotation by hybridizing plasmonics with magneto-optics. By fabricating plasmonic nanostructures on laser-deposited magneto-optical thin films.

Replicating these capabilities with engineered materials is challenging because of the difficulty in manufacturing and controlling soft material actuators with embedded fibers. In addition. while linear and bending motions are common in soft actuators. rotary motions require three-dimensional fiber wrapping or multiple bending or linear elements working in coordination that are challenging to design and fabricate. In this work. an automatic embroidery machine patterned Kevlar™ fibers and stretchable optical fibers into inflatable silicone membranes to control their inflated shape and enable sensing. This embroidery-based fabrication technique is simple. low cost. and allows for precise and custom patterning of fibers in elastomers. Using this technique. we developed inflatable elastomeric actuators embedded with a planar spiral pattern of high-strength Kevlar™ fibers that inflate into radially symmetric shapes and achieve nearly 180 angular rotation and 10 cm linear displacement.

Nanodome solar cells with only a 280 nm thick hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer can absorb 94% of the light with wavelengths of 400−800 nm. significantly higher than the 65% absorption of flat film devices. Because of the nearly complete absorption. a very large short-circuit current of 17.5 mA/cm2 is achieved in our nanodome devices.

Air conditioning. for example. accounts for nearly fifteen per cent of the primary energy used by buildings in the United States 1. A passive cooling strategy that cools without any electricity input could therefore have a significant impact on global energy consumption. To achieve cooling one needs to be able to reach and maintain a temperature below that of the ambient air.

Loss of Pel production in the laboratory strain PAO1 resulted in no difference in attachment or biofilm development; instead Psl proved to be the primary structural polysaccharide for biofilm maturity. Furthermore. we demonstrate that Pel plays a second role by enhancing resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. This protection occurs only in biofilm populations. We show that expression of the pel gene cluster and PelF protein levels are enhanced during biofilm growth compared to liquid cultures. Thus. we propose that Pel is capable of playing both a structural and a protective role in P. aeruginosa biofilms.,True,SrTLUzYAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,416,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001264,9610247984338516789,/scholar?cites=9610247984338516789,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001264,0,0,0

However. its functions are diverse. and include adhesion. motility. and horizontal gene transfer. This review focusses on the role of T4P in surface motility and bacterial interactions. Different species have evolved distinct mechanisms for intracellular coordination of multiple pili and of pili with other motility machines. ranging from physical coordination to biochemical clocks.

The “twitching” motility mode employed by many bacterial species for surface exploration uses type-IV pili (TFP) as linear actuators to enable directional crawling. In addition to linear motion. however. motility requires turns and changes of direction. Moreover. the motility mechanism must be adaptable to the continually changing surface conditions encountered during biofilm formation.

A histogram of scattering intensities can be used to construct the potential energy profile as a function of distance relative to the most probable distance. Thus potential energies can be measured to within a fraction of kT while changes in distance can be measured to within 1 nm. An autocorrelation of the scattering intensities can be used to deduce an average diffusion coefficient of the sphere. which is found to be only a few percent of the Stokes–Einstein value. owing to the close proximity of the plate.

A liquid solvent is employed as the carrier of gold nanoparticles (the material of interest in this study) possessing a low melting temperature compared to that of bulk gold. Using a specifically designed printing system. the gold nanoparticle solution is deposited on a substrate and cured with laser radiation. In this manner. the potential of writing gold structures on temperature sensitive substrates is demonstrated. The interaction between the laser radiation and nanoparticles drives the solvent evaporation and controls the quality of the microstructures printing process.

1106704,Thermal conductivity and diffusivity of free‐standing silicon nitride thin films,1995,Xiang Zhang and Costas P Grigoropoulos,66,Review of scientific instruments,2,1115-1120,American Institute of Physics,The thermal conductivity and diffusivity of free‐standing silicon nitride (Si‐N) films of 0.6 and 1.4 μm in thickness are measured. A new experimental technique. the amplitude method. is proposed and applied to measurement of the thin‐film thermal diffusivity. The thermal diffusivity is determined by three independent experimental approaches: the phase‐shift method. the amplitude method. and the heat‐pulse method. Good agreement among the measured thermal diffusivities obtained by the three methods indicates the validity of the amplitude method. High‐resolution electron microscopy studies show a large quantity of voids in the 1.4 μm Si‐N films. In contrast. very few voids are found in the 0.6 μm films.

For the understanding of transport processes involved in either. knowledge of in vivo CSF dynamics is important. We present a three-dimensional. transient. subject-specific computational analysis of CSF flow in the human cranial subarachnoid space (SAS) based on in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. We observed large variations in the spatial distribution of flow velocities with a temporal peak of 5 cm s−1 in the anterior SAS and less than 4 mm s−1 in the superior part.

With diffusion being the main mode of solute transport in cerebral tissue. it is not clear how bulk flow through these pathways is involved in the removal of metabolites. In this computational study. we show that networks of astrocytes may contribute to the passage of solutes between tissue and paravascular spaces (PVS) by serving as low resistance pathways to bulk water flow. The astrocyte networks are connected through aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels with a parallel. extracellular route carrying metabolites.

The hot water cooling enables efficient recovery of heat dissipated by the even hotter chip by using hot water recovered from a secondary application. Contrary to usual expectation of laminar flow in electronic cooling. high flow rate and high fluid temperatures result in turbulent flow conditions in the inlet and outlet manifolds of the heat sink with predominantly laminar flow conditions in microchannels. To simulate these complex flow conditions. a three dimensional (3D) conjugate heat transfer model with turbulent flow is developed. Microchannel heat transfer structure is modeled as porous medium with permeability parameters extracted from a 3D model for a single microchannel.

While a variety of life prediction models have been proposed for near eutectic SnPb (Ag)-solder joints in the literature. not enough work has been reported in extending these models to lead-free soldered assemblies. The development of lie prediction models requires a deep insight into failure modes. constitutive models for the themnomechanical behavior of solders and an experimental reliability database. This is needed for the correlation of experimentally determined cycles-to-failure to simulation results by fmiteelement analysis.This paper describes in detail the life-prediction models of SnPh (Ag) and SnAgCu solder joints for thermal cycle conditions. To obtain reliable FEM input and to verify simulation results. a variety of material testing and experimental fatigue data is necessary.

This principle challenges the properties of the stamp. especially when printing high-resolution or extreme aspect-ratio patterns with high accuracy. On the one hand. the stamp must be soft enough to enable conformal contact with the substrate. which means that it must adapt elastically without leaving voids created by the natural roughness of the substrate.

However. the role of intrinsic vs substrate contributions and the related mechanisms are vividly debated. Here. we show that the intrinsic hydrophilicity of graphene can be intimately connected to the position of its Fermi level. which affects the interaction between graphene and water molecules. The underlying substrate. or dopants. can tune hydrophilicity by modulating the Fermi level of graphene. By shifting the Fermi level of graphene away from its Dirac point. via either chemical or electrical voltage doping. we show enhanced hydrophilicity with experiments and first principle simulations.

Nanoengineered superhydrophobic surfaces can delay freezing passively; however. when exposed to sub-zero temperatures. they can get covered by frost. which promotes ice formation and impairs their icephobicity. In addition. high thermal conductivity of the surfaces can reduce the frost formation rate. Thus. we chose aluminum as our working material for its good thermal conductivity and widespread industrial usage. We employed electrochemical anodization process to control and tune the surface morphology. Crucially. we demonstrate the feasibility of morphology control at the nanoscale and tunability of the surface solid fraction in the range of 0.1–0.25. while using safer …,True,ZNakWfkAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,6,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01457632.2019.1640461,3694102212410121047,/scholar?cites=3694102212410121047,,,0,0,0

The fabrication process involves electrodeposition of cuprous oxide on a metallic wire or a sheet. embedding it inside a PDMS matrix along with the cross-linker. curing and then swelling the PDMS elastomer. and finally pulling out the template metal wire or the metal sheet from the PDMS matrix. Stronger attachment of the metal oxide layer to PDMS allows the transfer of the metal oxide coating originally present on the template surface (wire or sheet) to the channel wall resulting in a microchannel/microslit lined with the metal/metal oxide layer.

This study demonstrates the ability of copper inverse opal (CIO) porous structures to enhance pool boiling performance using a thin CIO film with a thickness of~ 10 µm and pore diameter of 5μm. The microfabricated CIO film increases microscale surface roughness that in turn leads to more active nucleation sites thus improved boiling performance parameters such as heat transfer coefficient and critical heat flux compared to those of smooth Si surfaces. The experimental results for CIO film show a maximum critical heat flux of 225 W/cm2 (at 16.2 C superheat) or about 3 times higher than that of smooth Si surface (80 W/cm2 at 21.6 C superheat).

1106865,Thermal Transport in Micro- and Nanoscale Systems,2018,Tanmoy Maitra and Shigang Zhang and Manish K. Tiwari,,,,Springer International Publishing,Springer International Publishing,Small-scale (micro-/nanoscale) heat transfer has broad and exciting range of applications. Heat transfer at small scale quite naturally is influenced – sometimes dramatically – with high surface area-to-volume ratios. This in effect means that heat transfer in small-scale devices and systems is influenced by surface treatment and surface morphology. Importantly. interfacial dynamic effects are at least non-negligible. and there is a strong potential to engineer the performance of such devices using the progress in micro- and nanomanufacturing technologies. With this motivation. the emphasis here is on heat conduction and convection. The chapter starts with a broad introduction to Boltzmann transport equation which captures the physics of small-scale heat transport. while also outlining the differences between small-scale transport and classical macroscale heat transport. Among applications. examples are thermoelectric and thermal interface materials where micro- and nanofabrication have led to impressive figure of merits and thermal management performance. Basic of phonon transport and its manipulation through nanostructuring materials are discussed in detail.  Small-scale single-phase convection and the crucial role it has played in developing the thermal management solutions for the next generation of electronics and energy-harvesting devices are discussed as the next topic.

1106868,Nanotextured surfaces for anti-icing,2018,Michael Grizen and Tanmoy Maitra and Manish K Tiwari,,,,,Begel House Inc.,Unwanted ice formation on surfaces is ubiquitous and often leads to catastrophic events. resulting in economic loss and costing human lives. Superhydrophobic nanotextured surfaces can circumvent such surface icing events either by minimizing the contact time between supercooled metastable liquid and surface or by suppressing ice nucleation events. However. such surfaces may not effectively inhibit icing under certain conditions. For example. superhydrophobic surfaces lose their non-wetting property when exposed to dynamically impacting water droplet/jet beyond a certain threshold velocity. Also. under high humidity conditions. surfaces become ineffective due to the formation of a frost layer. It has been shown that the roughness and thermal conductivity of the surface play a vital role to overcome aforementioned problems.

The foldable. light and durable nature of flexible electronics allows vast flexibility in applications such as display. energy devices and mobile electronics. Even though conventional electronics fabrication methods are well developed for rigid substrates. direct application or slight modification of conventional processes for flexible electronics fabrication cannot work. The future flexible electronics fabrication requires totally new low-temperature process development optimized for flexible substrate and it should be based on new material too. Here we present a simple approach to developing a flexible electronics fabrication without using conventional vacuum deposition and photolithography. We found that direct metal patterning based on laser-induced local melting of metal nanoparticle ink is a promising low-temperature alternative to vacuum deposition– and photolithography-based conventional metal patterning processes. The “digital” nature of the proposed direct metal patterning process removes the need for expensive photomask and allows easy design modification and short turnaround time. This new process can be extremely useful for current small-volume. large-variety manufacturing paradigms.

Radiation from a focused continuous green light laser (514 nm wavelength) is used to provide the energy for steam–methanol reforming. Nanocatalyst particles. fabricated by using pulsed laser ablation technology. result in a highly active catalyst with high surface to volume ratio. A small novel reformer fabricated with a borosilicate capillary is employed to increase the local temperature of the reformer and thereby increase hydrogen production. The hydrogen production output efficiency is determined and a value of 5% is achieved. Experiments using concentrated solar simulator light as the radiation source are also carried out.

The baseline engine configuration consists of a hemispherical piston bowl and an injector with finite sac volume. The first iteration involved using a torroidal. slightly re-entrant bowl geometry. and a sac-less injector. Pollutant emission measurements indicated a reduction in emissions with this modification. Simulations on both configurations were then conducted to understand the effect of the changes. The simulation results indicate that the selected piston bowl geometry could actually be reducing the in-cylinder swirl and turbulence and the emission reduction may be entirely due to the introduction of the sac-less injector.

However. the role of intrinsic vs substrate contributions and the related mechanisms are vividly debated. Here. we show that the intrinsic hydrophilicity of graphene can be intimately connected to the position of its Fermi level. which affects the interaction between graphene and water molecules. The underlying substrate. or dopants. can tune hydrophilicity by modulating the Fermi level of graphene. By shifting the Fermi level of graphene away from its Dirac point. via either chemical or electrical voltage doping. we show enhanced hydrophilicity with experiments and first principle simulations.

This is crucial for application studies and vehicle architectural studies because most of the emissions from a TWC occur before light-off (called cold-start emissions). Laboratory experiments give detailed insights to the reaction mechanism and analytical forms of the rate expressions as they are well-controlled and well-behaved as compared to vehicle tests. However. to predict emissions on a vehicle test. the laboratory-estimated kinetic parameters are not entirely capable because of the various uncertainties in the vehicle tests. In this work. six different vehicle data sets are used to calibrate and validate the TWC global kinetic model.

Ca= O (0. 001)− O (0. 01). Re= O (100)− O (1000). Oh= O (0. 001) and Bo= O (0. 1). In this impact regime. inertial. viscous and capillary phenomena act in unison to influence contact angle dynamics. The wetting properties of the target surfaces range from wettable to non-wettable. The experiments feature accelerating and decelerating wetting lines. capillary surface waves in the early impact stages. contact angle hysteresis. and droplet rebound under non-wetting conditions. The objective of the work is to provide insight into the dynamic behaviour of the apparent (macroscopic) contact angle θ and its dependence on contact line velocity VCL at various degrees of surface wetting. By correlating the temporal behaviours of θ and VCL. the angle vs. speed relationship is established for each case examined. The results reveal that surface wettability has a critical influence on dynamic contact angle behaviour. The hydrodynamic wetting theory of Cox (J.

Such release attracts attention in relation to biomedical applications. such as controlled drug delivery. It is also important for stem cell attachment and differentiation on biocompatible electrospun nanofiber scaffolds containing growth factors. which have been encapsulated by means of electrospinning. Typically. the release mechanism has been attributed to solid-state diffusion of the encapsulated compound from the fibers into the surrounding aqueous bath. Under this assumption. a 100% release of the encapsulated compound is expected in a certain (long) time. The present work focuses on certain cases where complete release does not happen. which suggests that solid-state diffusion may not be the primary mechanism at play.

This work focused on assessing the potential icephobicity of superhydrophobic coatings as an alternative passive strategy. Ice shedding tests were conducted in a helicopter blade icing chamber. to simulate atmospheric icing conditions. Ice accretion and shedding were tested on four different materials. including two common metals and two superhydrophobic materials. with the objective of evaluating icephobic potential for anti-icing purposes. Coating test results showed a strong influence of temperature and surface roughness on the ice adhesion: the strength increased when temperature decreased and roughness increased.

Drop impact experiments were performed with millimetric water drops with Weber numbers in the range 25 < We < 585. using different surfaces with advancing contact angles 111° < θ A < 160° and receding contact angles 104° < θ R < 155°. The analysis of oblique impacts onto tilted surfaces led to the definition of six different impact regimes: deposition. rivulet. sliding. rolling. partial rebound. and rebound. For superhydrophobic surfaces. surface tilting generally enhanced drop rebound and shedding from the surface. either by reducing drop rebound time up to 40 % or by allowing drop rebound even when impalement occurred in the vicinity …,True,2CKjmrcAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,68,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00348-014-1713-9,32881744988926456,/scholar?cites=32881744988926456,,https://doc.rero.ch/record/325042/files/348_2014_Article_1713.pdf,0,0,0

Both the drop evolution (i.e. spreading. recoiling. as well as oscillations) upon impact on a soft gel substrate (i.e. polydimethylsiloxane. PDMS) and substrate deformation caused by the impact force (for Weber numbers 110 < We < 520) were analyzed. Results were compared with similar tests carried out using hard. non-deformable PDMS substrates (two orders of magnitude more rigid than soft substrates). A sensor was designed based on the principle of a two-degree of freedom lever and successfully implemented to measure the maximum deformation of soft substrates during drop impact. Analysis of drop deformation highlighted that the recoil phase on a soft surface is slower. the final diameter of the resting drop is larger. and consequently the final resting contact angle is lower. when compared to impacts on hard …,True,2CKjmrcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,68,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2012/sm/c2sm26049b,18183003019799563419,/scholar?cites=18183003019799563419,,https://www.academia.edu/download/41914676/Understanding_the_drop_impact_phenomenon20160202-31151-xd1fxe.pdf,0,0,0

Also. if FAS is further added to the solution the procedure can impart superhydrophobicity to further aluminum samples.

Here we report the development of an optimized fabrication process for highly porous cellulose foams. based on a well-controlled freeze-thawing-drying (FTD) process at ambient pressure. This process enables the fabrication of foams with ultra-high porosity. up to 99.4%. density of 10 mg/cm 3. and liquid (such as oil) absorption capacity of 100 L/kg. The proposed approach is based on the ice-templating of nanocellulose suspension in water. followed by thawing in ethanol and drying at environmental pressures. As such. the proposed fabrication route overcomes one of the major bottle-necks of the classical freeze-drying approach. by eliminating the energy-demanding vacuum drying step required to avoid wet foam collapse upon drying. As a result. the process is simple. environmentally friendly. and easily scalable. Details of the foam development fabrication process and functionalization are thoroughly discussed. highlighting the main parameters affecting the process. eg. the concentration of nanocellulose and additives used to control the ice nucleation. The foams are also characterized by mechanical tests and oil absorption measurements. which are used to assess the foam absorption capability as well as the foam porosity. Compound water-in-oil drop impact experiments are used to demonstrate the potential of immiscible liquid separation using cellulose foams.

One patient with saphenous CABG and end-to-side anastomosis and one patient with saphenous CABG and side-to-side anastomosis underwent 16-detector row computed tomography (CT). Geometric models of coronary arteries and bypasses were reconstructed for CFD analysis. Blood flow was considered pulsatile …,True,24Aa9QcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,65,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1475-925X-6-35,1904672277334066980,/scholar?cites=1904672277334066980,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1475-925X-6-35,0,0,0

Several biomechanical parameters can be taken into account to formulate case specific indicators of the risk of rupture [1]. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to quantify relevant hemodynamics indices based on velocity. wall shear stress (WSS). and pressure within the aneurismal sack [2. 3]. This is a task of increased difficulty necessitating advanced grid generation techniques and experimental cross-validation because of the complexity of the underlying anatomy and the need for in vivo physiological and/or pathological boundary conditions.

A method for mapping analytical or experimental velocity profiles on anatomically realistic boundary cross-sections is presented. Interpolation is required because the computational and experimental domains are seldom aligned. In the absence of velocity information one alternative is the adaptation of analytical profiles based on volumetric flux constraints. The presented algorithms are based on the Schwarz-Christoffel (S-C) mapping of singly or doubly connected polygons to the unit circle or an annulus with unary external radius. S-C transformations are combined to construct a one-to-one invertible map between the target surface and the measurement domain or the support of the source analytical profile.

Although fabricating the semiconductor in a nanocrystalline morphology can slow this cooling. the transfer of hot carriers to electron and hole acceptors has not yet been thoroughly demonstrated. We used time-resolved optical second harmonic generation to observe hot-electron transfer from colloidal lead selenide (PbSe) nanocrystals to a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron acceptor. With appropriate chemical treatment of the nanocrystal surface. this transfer occurred much faster than expected.

To this end. we have developed a segment-wise three-dimensional computational model that takes into account transport processes in arteries. veins. cortical tissue. and capillaries. Our model suggests that the amount of preglomerular oxygen shunting is negligible.

Cortical tissue oxygenation is more likely determined by the interplay between oxygen supply. either from the preglomerular vasculature or from capillaries. and oxygen consumption.

In their letter (1).

We agree with the first statement. but point out that it does not contradict the results of our study. We do not agree with the second. Here are our responses to each point.With regard to point 1. we agree with Evans et al.(1) that “the experimental findings of Levy and colleagues can only be satisfactorily explained by diffusive shunting of oxygen between arteries and veins in the renal cortex.” In the study that Evans et al. refer to.

We hypothesized that a reverse (venous-to-arterial) shunting of carbon dioxide will increase partial pressure of carbon dioxide and decrease pH in the arteries and thereby lead to increased oxygen offloading and consequent oxygen shunting. To test this hypothesis. we employed a segment-wise three-dimensional computational model of coupled renal oxygen and carbon dioxide transport. wherein coupling is achieved by shifting the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve in dependence of local changes in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and pH. The model suggests that primarily due to the high buffering capacity of blood. there is only marginally increased acidity in the preglomerular vasculature compared to systemic arterial blood caused by carbon dioxide shunting. Furthermore. effects of carbon dioxide transport do not promote but rather impair preglomerular oxygen shunting. as the increase in acidity is higher in the veins compared to that in the arteries. We conclude that while substantial arterial-to-venous oxygen shunting might take place in the postglomerular vasculature. the net amount of oxygen shunted at the preglomerular vasculature appears to be marginal.,True,5gB8GTUAAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC,6,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00482/full,16744288047775829252,/scholar?cites=16744288047775829252,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00482/full,0,0,0

1107083,Computational modeling of low-density lipoprotein transport in human coronary arteries: Implications for atherosclerosis,2009,Ufuk Olgac,,,,,,Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the developed nations. It is the end result of atherosclerotic plaque formation in the coronary arteries. Blocking of the coronary arteries by plaques causes the heart muscle not to get enough oxygen. Vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques may rupture and create particles that could block the coronary artery downstream and lead to myocardial infarction. Therefore. it is very crucial to understand the mechanisms governing the atherosclerotic plaque formation to develop better disease prevention techniques and treatment options. Computational modeling is helpful in understanding natural phenomenon that could not be experimentally reproduced. Plaque formation happens in vivo and spans over a time range of tens of years. In vitro experimental models. therefore. are not enough to fully understand the formation process. Medical imaging technologies and in vivo measurement techniques have improved significantly over the last years. Imagebased computational modeling fed with in vivo pressure and flow measurements could therefore be a resourceful tool in understanding the formation and progression of atherosclerosis.The focus of this work is on the initial stages of plaque formation. Plaque formation initiates with the subendothelial retention of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). followed by accumulation and oxidation of it.

Sputtered Ni is used to reduce the in-plane resistance of the VACNT electrodes. An ionogel. an ionic liquid in a semi-solid matrix. is used as an electrolyte to form a fully solid-state device.

Here we focus on the significant category of microscale co-laminar flows encountered in membraneless redox flow cells for power delivery. The grand challenge is to achieve simultaneously convective mixing within each individual reactant. to thin the reaction depletion boundary layers. while maintaining separation of the co-flowing reactants. despite the absence of a membrane. The concept presented here achieves this goal with the help of optimized herringbone flow promoting microstructures with an integrated separation zone.

The dried deposits often exhibit complex structures exemplified by the coffee ring pattern. where most particles have accumulated at the periphery of the deposit. In this work. the formation of deposits during the drying of nanoliter colloidal drops on a flat substrate is investigated numerically and experimentally.

This review aims at bridging the gap between the material sciences and heat transfer communities. It makes the argument that optimum surfaces need to address the specificities of phase change heat transfer in the way that a key matches its lock. This calls for the design and fabrication of adaptive surfaces with multiscale textures and non-uniform wettability. Among numerous challenges to meet the rising global energy demand in a sustainable manner. improving phase change heat transfer has been at the forefront of engineering research for decades.

An important and novel such process in the area of micromanufacturing is solder jetting where microscopic solder droplets are dispensed for the attachment of microelectronic components.

In both the BPA and FD communities. scientists study the motion and phase change of a liquid in contact with air. or with other liquids or solids. Five aspects of BPA related to FD are discussed: the physical forces driving the motion of blood as a fluid; the generation of the drops; their flight in the air; their impact on solid or liquid surfaces; and the production of stains. For each of these topics. the relevant literature from the BPA community and from the FD community is reviewed.

One limitation of current single-phase microchannel heat sinks is the relatively low Nusselt number. due to laminar flow. In this work. we experimentally investigate how to enhance the Nusselt number with the introduction of segmented flow. The segmented flow pattern was created by the periodic injection of air bubbles through a T-junction into water-filled channels. We designed a polycarbonate heat sink consisting of an array of seven parallel microchannels each with a square cross-section 500 μm wide.

The work function of the TiO2. measured using a Kelvin probe. increases with increasing density of carboxylic acid groups due to the formation of interfacial dipoles pointing toward the TiO2 surface.

We overcame these shortcomings by employing scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to map the prognostic indicator tyrosinase (TyR) in non‐metastatic and metastatic melanoma tissues by using soft‐stylus microelectrodes. Electrochemical readout of the TyR distribution was enabled by adapting an immunochemical method. SECM can overcome the limitations of optical methods and opens unprecedented possibilities for improved diagnosis and understanding of the spatial distribution of TyR in different melanoma stages.,True,F-ob7IsAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,45,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201509397,11545228223739392429,/scholar?cites=11545228223739392429,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/215846/files/anie201509397-sup-0001-misc_information.pdf,0,0,0

Cyclic voltammograms and admittance measurements show an increase of the interface excess charge associated with the adsorption of CdSe nanoparticles as the Galvani potential difference is tuned to negative values with respect to the potential in the organic phase. Within the potential range where the nanoparticles are adsorbed. band-gap illumination leads to heterogeneous electron transfer from CdSe nanoparticles to electron acceptors located in the organic phase. The interfacial Galvani potential difference plays an important role in these phenomena. as it affects the interfacial density of the nanoparticles. as well as the driving force for the electron transfer.

The analytical sensitivity increased on miniaturisation of the interface from millimetre‐. to micrometre‐. to nanometre‐scale. with an improvement in sensitivity of more than three orders of magnitude.

Insight into the mechanism and kinetics of light‐driven biphasic hydrogen evolution are obtained by analysis with gas chromatography. cyclic voltammetry. and UV/Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Formation of decamethylosmocenium hydride. which occurs prior to hydrogen evolution. is a rapid step relative to hydrogen release and takes place independently of light activation. Remarkably. hydride formation occurs with greater efficiency (ca. 90 % conversion) under biphasic conditions than when the reaction is carried out in an acidified single organic phase (ca. 20 % conversion).

In this contribution the use of nanopipettes for simultaneous surface charge mapping and topographical imaging is demonstrated. using a scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) format. When a nanopipette is positioned close to a surface in electrolyte solution. the direct ion current (DC). driven by an applied bias between a quasi-reference counter electrode (QRCE) in the nanopipette and a second QRCE in the bulk solution. is sensitive to surface charge. The charge sensitivity arises because the diffuse double layers at the nanopipette and the surface interact. creating a perm-selective region which becomes increasingly significant at low ionic strengths (10 mM 1:1 aqueous electrolyte herein).

It is shown that. when a bias modulated (BM) SICM scheme is used. it is possible to map the topography faithfully. while also allowing surface charge to be estimated. This is achieved by applying zero net bias between the electrode in the SICM tip and the one in bulk solution for topographical mapping. with just a small harmonic perturbation of the potential to create an AC current for tip positioning. Then. a net bias is applied. whereupon the ion conductance current becomes sensitive to surface charge.

Thus. in a much wider range of glass pipettes with radii from several nanometers to a few micrometers. the ion current rectification (ICR) phenomenon has been observed. The influences of different KCl concentrations. pH values. and tip radii on the ICR are investigated in detail. The sizes of PEIs have been determined by dynamic light scattering. and the effect of the sizes of PEIs for the modification. especially for a few nanometer-pipettes in radii. is also discussed.

In this report. we develop the use and scope of SICM. showing how it can be used for mapping spatial distributions of ionic fluxes due to (electro)chemical reactions occurring at interfaces. The basic idea is that there is a change of ion conductance inside a nanopipet probe when it approaches an active site. where the ionic composition is different to that in bulk solution. and this can be sensed via the current flow in the nanopipet with an applied bias. Careful tuning of the tip potential allows the current response to be sensitive to either topography or activity. if desired.

As a consequence. the characterization of mAbs on different levels is particularly product - and time - consuming. This work presents the characterization of trastuzumab sequence using sheathless capillary electrophoresis (referred as CESI) – tandem mass spectrometry (CESI-MS/MS). Using this bottom-up proteomic-like approach. CESI-MS/MS provided 100% sequence coverage for both heavy and light chain via peptide fragment fingerprinting (PFF) identification. The result was accomplished in a single shot. corresponding to the analysis of 100 fmoles of digest.

The contribution arising from the electron injection. recombination–product separation competition and the attenuation associated with the uncompensated resistance and interfacial capacitance (RC) time constant of the cell were deconvoluted in the frequency domain. The flux of electron injection was described in terms of a competition between the relaxation of the porphyrin excited state and the electron transfer step. Experimental results in the presence of ferrocene and diferrocenylethane confirmed that as the Galvani potential difference is increased. the phenomenological electron transfer rate constant increases and the ZnTPPC coverage at the liquid/liquid junction decreases. Furthermore. the recombination rate constant decreases with increasing potentials. while the product separation rate constant did not show a clear potential dependence. Photocurrent studies were extended to the electron donors dimethylferrocene and trianisylamine. as well as to the electron acceptor tetracyanoquinodimethane. The results obtained clearly indicate that the Gibbs energy of activation for the charge transfer process is affected by the Galvani potential difference.

By using surface-modified beads. microscopic structures with defined biochemical activity are formed. The shape and size of agglomerates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). and the biochemical activity was mapped with scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). This approach is demonstrated using beads modified with anti-mouse antibodies (Ab). After allowing them to react with a conjugate of mouse IgG and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). the beads were deposited as agglomerates of well-defined size and shape.

The spectrum exhibits a narrow resonance band peaked at 520 nm as a result of the coupling of the second harmonic field with the surface plasmon of the particles. The nonlinear second harmonic response of gold clusters is found to be blueshifted compared to the bulk. due to the finite size effects on the cluster optical properties. as already observed with the linear response. Furthermore. this nonlinear response appears to be well described with a simple free electron model where the valence electrons only participate through the screening of the ionic cores. owing to the weakness of the interband transition contribution.,True,16fDL1AAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,85,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.368679,8456177031588261300,/scholar?cites=8456177031588261300,,http://www.atlas.uni-wuppertal.de/FP/anleitungen/fpI-10/weiterf_paper_FPII2/JAPPLPHYS_84_1998_4532.PDF,0,0,0

The nonquantitative aspect of the covalent tagging thus allows direct counting of free cysteines in the mass spectrum of a biomolecule through additional adduct peaks.

The gold nanoparticles in the nanofilm are charged by Fermi level equilibration with the lipophilic electron donor and act as an interfacial reservoir of electrons. Additional thermodynamic driving force can be provided by electrochemically polarising the interface.

The purpose of this paper is to revisit this topic using a finite element simulation approach to analyze cyclic voltammograms for some previously published systems. Also. we compare the voltammograms obtained in the absence or presence of an adsorbed gold nanoparticle film. The current results indicate that the electron transfer between ferrocene in the organic phase and hexacyanoferrate(III) in the aqueous phase takes place by a potential independent homogeneous reaction in the aqueous phase. while the observed potential dependence stems from that of the concomitant ion transfer reaction of ferrocenium. In the presence of the interfacial gold nanofilm the electron transfer takes place by a bipolar mechanism where the electrons are shuttled through the metallic nanofilm.,True,h8XadPoAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,20,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572665716300662,12879144942016747207,/scholar?cites=12879144942016747207,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/216942/files/1-s2.0-S1572665716300662-main.pdf,0,0,0

Its production is currently based almost exclusively on the anthraquinone hydrogenation and oxidation process.[2] Many alternative routes have also been developed. one of which is the electrochemical cathodic reduction of O2[2–4] in the presence of molecular electrocatalysts such as metalloporphyrins [5 …,True,XI7P5g8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,87,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.200801004,6588846530022839211,/scholar?cites=6588846530022839211,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ange.200801004,0,0,0

The common approach in the development of oxygen evolution catalysts is to search for catalytic materials with new and optimized chemical compositions and structures. Here we report an orthogonal approach to improve the activity of catalysts without alternating their compositions or structures. Specifically. liquid phase exfoliation is applied to enhance the oxygen evolution activity of layered double hydroxides. The exfoliated single-layer nanosheets exhibit significantly higher oxygen evolution activity than the corresponding bulk layered double hydroxides in alkaline conditions. The nanosheets from nickel iron and nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides outperform a commercial iridium dioxide catalyst in both activity and stability.

The limitations of precious HER catalysts prompts the search for and development of non-precious catalysts.[3] Molybdenum-based materials and molecules have drawn much attention recently.[4–7] In particular. molybdenum sulfides have been shown to exhibit high HER activity.[4–6] There is experimental and computational evidence that the active sites in these catalysts are located at the Mo edge. where there are unsaturated sulfur atoms.[4] These sulfur atoms can adsorb hydrogen atoms and mediate hydrogen evolution.Herein. we report that molybdenum boride (MoB) and carbide (Mo2C) are active HER catalysts. To our knowledge. this is the first time MoB has been shown to be a HER catalyst. Although Mo2C has been shown to be a good support for Pt in HER.[8] its own HER activity has not been studied in detail.[9] Our results are interesting in several aspects: 1) The catalysts are non-precious and commercially available.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a complex four-electron process that constitutes the most energy-inefficient step in water electrolysis. Here we describe a novel electrochemical method for the deposition of a family of thin-film transition metal (oxy)hydroxides as OER catalysts. The thin films have nanodomains of crystallinity with lattice spacing similar to those of double-layered hydroxides. The loadings of these thin-film catalysts were accurately determined with a resolution of below 1 μg cm–2 using an electrochemical quartz microcrystal balance.

With this system. a large amount of beads can be captured without inducing a strong pressure drop. as it is the case with magnetic beads trapped in a standard capillary. thereby having less effect on the experimental conditions. Using numerical simulations and microscopic visualizations. the capture of beads inside a bubble cell was investigated with two magnet configurations. Pressure-driven and electro-osmotic flow velocities were measured for different amounts of protein-A-coated beads or C18-functionalized beads (RPC-18). Solid-phase extraction of a model antibody on protein-A beads and preconcentration of fluorescein on RPC-18 beads were performed as proof of concept experiments.

To date. several approaches have been proposed for the implementation of a combined sampling and analysis of inorganic (IGSR) and organic GSR (OGSR). However. it is not clear at this stage if concurrent analyses of both types of residue might be detrimental to the analysis of IGSR currently applied in forensic laboratories. Thus. this work aims to compare and evaluate three different protocols for the combined collection and analysis of IGSR and OGSR. These methods. respectively. involve the use of a modified stub (with two halves. one for the detection of IGSR and the other for the analysis of OGSR); the sequential recovery of GSR with two stubs mounted with different adhesives (double‐sided carbon tape and Tesa® TACK) and the sequential analysis of IGSR and …,True,dsGxG5UAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,2,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1556-4029.14314,10435315878172111637,/scholar?cites=10435315878172111637,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denis_Werner/publication/339992038_Combined_Collection_and_Analysis_of_Inorganic_and_Organic_Gunshot_Residues/links/5e7b0a01299bf1f3873fce12/Combined-Collection-and-Analysis-of-Inorganic-and-Organic-Gunshot-Residues.pdf,0,0,0

Additionally. this approach categorized if genes functioned during mitotic expansion or lipogenesis. Cellular mechanisms regulating the rates of protein translation and protein stability were found to be critical for adipogenesis and lipogenesis. These mechanisms were further supported by proteomic analyses. which demonstrated that many changes in protein abundance during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis were not driven by transcription.

Bearing the advantages of easy-to-use. fast measurements and relatively simple data interpretation. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry has been expanded from research laboratories to clinical applications. In this thesis. methods based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry are developed for the purpose of bacterial infection diagnosis and cancer analysis. Magnetic beads coated with antibodies specific to bacterial species are used to isolate and enrich bacterial cells from complex matrices. This immuno-affinity bacterial capture/enrichment procedure is combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for the fast identification of bacterial pathogens in human blood.

Experiments show a difference in the stripping voltammetry of bismuth from a single crystal Au(111) electrode where the bismuth covers the surface in relatively flat film and a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode where the hemispherical deposits are seen on the surface. It is shown using mathematical modeling and numerical simulation that this difference cannot be accounted for by simply considering the different distributions of bismuth on the electrode surfaces. Rather. it is concluded that the difference in voltammetry is mainly due to the morphology/orientation of the deposits formed leading to differences in the kinetics and thermodynamics of the stripping process.,True,ahsgqDoAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,13,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp809355n,5518458612338895131,/scholar?cites=5518458612338895131,,http://bs6vx4ge6d.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&auinit=SEW&aulast=Jones&atitle=The+stripping+voltammetry+of+hemispherical+deposits+under+electrochemically+irreversible+conditions:+a+comparison+of+the+stripping+voltammetry+of+bismuth+on+boron-doped+diamond+and+Au+(111)+electrodes&id=doi:10.1021/jp809355n&title=Journal+of+physical+chemistry.+C&volume=113&issue=7&date=2009&spage=2846&issn=1932-7447,0,0,0

Observing that in many sensing scenarios. the location information can be post-processed when the data is uploaded to a server. we design a Cloud-Offloaded GPS (CO-GPS) solution that allows a sensing device to aggressively duty-cycle its GPS receiver and log just enough raw GPS signal for post-processing. Leveraging publicly available information such as GNSS satellite ephemeris and an Earth elevation database. a cloud service can derive good quality GPS locations from a few milliseconds of raw data. Using our design of a portable sensing device platform called CLEO. we evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the solution.

Programming embedded systems with multiple reactive tasks is difficult due to the complex nature of managing the concurrency of execution threads and consistency of shared states. This paper describes a globally asynchronous and locally synchronous model (TinyGALS) for programming event-driven embedded systems. Software components are composed locally through synchronous method calls to form modules. and asynchronous message passing is used between modules to separate the flow of control. In addition. a guarded yet synchronous model (TinyGUYS) is designed to allow thread-safe sharing of global state by multiple modules without explicitly passing messages.

While most work in the field of power management and low-power design has focused on optimizing the energy consumer (ie. the sensor node. including its hardware. software. applications. and network protocols). very little work has targeted the energy supply system itself. A practical approach to alleviating the problem of limited battery resources in sensor nodes is the use of environmental energy harvesting.

1107737,Harvesting aware power management for sensor networks,2006,Aman Kansal and Jason Hsu and Mani Srivastava and Vijay Raghunathan,,,,651-656,,Energy harvesting offers a promising alternative to solve the sustainability limitations arising from battery size constraints in sensor networks. Several considerations in using an environmental energy source are fundamentally different from using batteries. Rather than a limit on the total energy. harvesting transducers impose a limit on the instantaneous power available. Further. environmental energy availability is often highly variable and a deterministic metric such as residual battery capacity is not available to characterize the energy source. The different nodes in a sensor network may also have different energy harvesting opportunities. Since the same end-user performance may be achieved using different workload allocations at multiple nodes. it is important to adapt the workload allocation to the spatio-temporal energy availability profile in order to enable energy-neutral operation of the network.

1107760,DECAF: DEtecting and Characterizing Ad Fraud in Mobile Apps,2014,Bin Liu and Suman Nath and Ramesh Govindan and Jie Liu,,,,,USENIX,Ad networks for mobile apps require inspection of the visual layout of their ads to detect certain types of placement frauds. Doing this manually is error prone. and does not scale to the sizes of today’s app stores. In this paper. we design a system called DECAF to automatically discover various placement frauds scalably and effectively. DECAF uses automated app navigation. together with optimizations to scan through a large number of visual elements within a limited time. It also includes a framework for efficiently detecting whether ads within an app violate an extensible set of rules that govern ad placement and display. We have implemented DECAF for Windows-based mobile platforms. and applied it to 1.150 tablet apps and 50.000 phone apps in order to characterize the prevalence of ad frauds. DECAF has been used by the ad fraud team in Microsoft and has helped find many instances of ad frauds.,True,-gousdQAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC,138,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/liu_bin,9900182765792950171,/scholar?cites=9900182765792950171,,https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi14/nsdi14-paper-liu_bin.pdf,0,0,0
1107761,Subtleties in Tolerating Correlated Failures in Wide-area Storage Systems.,2006,Suman Nath and Haifeng Yu and Phillip B Gibbons and Srinivasan Seshan,6,NSDI,,225-238,,High availability is widely accepted as an explicit requirement for distributed storage systems. Tolerating correlated failures is a key issue in achieving high availability in today’s wide-area environments. This paper systematically revisits previously proposed techniques for addressing correlated failures. Using several real-world failure traces. we qualitatively answer four important questions regarding how to design systems to tolerate such failures. Based on our results. we identify a set of design principles that system builders can use to tolerate correlated failures. We show how these lessons can be effectively used by incorporating them into IRISSTORE. a distributed read-write storage layer that provides high availability. Our results using IRISSTORE on the PlanetLab over an 8-month period demonstrate its ability to withstand large correlated failures and meet preconfigured availability targets.,True,-gousdQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,138,https://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi06/tech/full_papers/nath/nath.pdf,2231318381472548766,/scholar?cites=2231318381472548766,,https://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi06/tech/full_papers/nath/nath.pdf,0,0,0

The main challenge is that call sites that invoke third-party code may be deeply embedded in the app. beyond the reach of traditional GUI testing tools. Our approach uses static analysis to construct a page transition graph and discover execution paths to invoke third-party code. We then perform binary rewriting to “jump start” the third-party code by following the execution path. efficiently pruning out undesired executions. Compared with the state-of-theart GUI testing tools. Brahmastra is able to successfully analyse third-party code in 2.7× more apps and decrease test duration by a factor of 7.

However. previous work on geographic routing makes the unrealistic assumption that all the nodes in the network are awake during routing. This overlooks the common deployment scenario where sensor nodes are duty-cycled to save energy. In this paper we investigate several important aspects of geographic routing over duty-cycled nodes. First. we extend existing geographic routing algorithms to handle the highly dynamic networks resulting from duty-cycling. Second. we provide the first formal analysis of the performance of geographic routing on duty-cycled nodes.

These are targeted at emerging data-intensive networked systems that require massive hash tables running into a hundred GB or more. with items being inserted. updated and looked up at a rapid rate. For such systems. using DRAM to maintain hash tables is quite expensive. while on-disk approaches are too slow. In contrast. CLAMs cost nearly the same as using existing on-disk approaches but offer orders of magnitude better performance. Our design leverages an efficient flash-oriented data-structure called BufferHash that significantly lowers the amortized cost of random hash insertions and updates on flash. BufferHash also supports flexible CLAM eviction policies. We prototype CLAMs using SSDs from two different vendors.

PointNet by Qi et al. is a pioneer in this direction. However. by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in. limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work. we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances. our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities. which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities. we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales.

Current state-of-the-art methods rely on CNNs to address this problem. Recently. we witness two types of CNNs being developed: CNNs based upon volumetric representations versus CNNs based upon multi-view representations. Empirical results from these two types of CNNs exhibit a large gap. indicating that existing volumetric CNN architectures and approaches are unable to fully exploit the power of 3D representations. In this paper. we aim to improve both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs according to extensive analysis of existing approaches. To this end. we introduce two distinct network architectures of volumetric CNNs. In addition. we examine multi-view CNNs. where we introduce multi-resolution filtering in 3D. Overall. we are able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods for both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs.

While previous methods focus on images or 3D voxels. often obscuring natural 3D patterns and invariances of 3D data. we directly operate on raw point clouds by popping up RGB-D scans. However. a key challenge of this approach is how to efficiently localize objects in point clouds of large-scale scenes (region proposal). Instead of solely relying on 3D proposals. our method leverages both mature 2D object detectors and advanced 3D deep learning for object localization. achieving efficiency as well as high recall for even small objects.

The majority of extant works resort to regular representations such as volumetric grids or collection of images; however. these representations obscure the natural invariance of 3D shapes under geometric transformations. and also suffer from a number of other issues. In this paper we address the problem of 3D reconstruction from a single image. generating a straight-forward form of output--point cloud coordinates. Along with this problem arises a unique and interesting issue. that the groundtruth shape for an input image may be ambiguous. Driven by this unorthordox output form and the inherent ambiguity in groundtruth. we design architecture. loss function and learning paradigm that are novel and effective. Our final solution is a conditional shape sampler. capable of predicting multiple plausible 3D point clouds from an input image.

A small number of feature points are automatically picked from the data shape according to the uniqueness of the descriptor value at the point. For each feature point on the data. we use the descriptor values of the model to find potential corresponding points.

The circumstances are particularly unfavorable for ZigBee networks that share the 2.4 GHz ISM band with WiFi senders capable of 10 to 100 times higher transmission power. Our work first examines the interference patterns between ZigBee and WiFi networks at the bit-level granularity. Under certain conditions. ZigBee activities can trigger a nearby WiFi transmitter to back off. in which case the header is often the only part of the Zig-Bee packet being corrupted. We call this the symmetric interference regions. in comparison to the asymmetric regions where the ZigBee signal is too weak to be detected by WiFi senders. but WiFi activity can uniformly corrupt any bit in a ZigBee packet.

However. many sensor network operating systems still choose to provide an eventdriven model. due to efficiency concerns. We present TOS-Threads. a threads package for TinyOS that combines the ease of a threaded programming model with the efficiency of an event-based kernel. TOSThreads is backwards compatible with existing TinyOS code. supports an evolvable. thread-safe kernel API. and enables flexible application development through dynamic linking and loading. In TOS-Threads. TinyOS code runs at a higher priority than application threads and all kernel operations are invoked only via message passing. never directly. ensuring thread-safety while enabling maximal concurrency. The TOSThreads package is non-invasive; it does not require any large-scale changes to existing TinyOS code. We demonstrate that TOSThreads context switches and system calls introduce an overhead of less than 0.92% and that dynamic linking and loading takes as little as 90 ms for a representative sensing application. We compare different programming models built using TOSThreads. including standard C with blocking system calls and a reimplementation of Tenet.

While the community has been working on monitoring the building energy usage. we argue that an accurate accounting of individual occupants' energy expenditure in real-time is still the missing piece. And. this missing piece makes incentivizing energy reduction a challenge. We take a systematic approach and identify the lack of real-time association between human actions and observed energy consumption as one roadblock.

However. cover query. which is to find all the ranges currently in the system that cover a given key. is rarely touched. In this paper. we first identify that cover query is a highly desired functionality by some popular P2P applications. and then propose distributed segment tree (DST). a layered DHT structure that incorporates the concept of segment tree. Due to the intrinsic capability of segment tree in maintaining the sturcture of ranges. DST is shown to be very efficient for supporting both range query and cover query in a uniform way. It also possesses excellent parallelizability in query operations and can achieve O (1) complexity for moderate query ranges.

We outline the design of several key tools of the proposed HPTP framework–HTTPifying. cache detection and usability test tools. and describe a cache-aware tree construction (CATC) protocol for delivering P2P streaming traffic as an example to showcase the HPTP framework.

In the present second part we analyze the behavior of GLL algorithms and provide extensions to the core methods. Specifically. we investigate the empirical convergence of GLL to the true local neighborhood as a function of sample size. Moreover. we study how predictivity improves with increasing sample size. Then we investigate how sensitive are the algorithms to multiple statistical testing. especially in the presence of many irrelevant features. Next we discuss the role of the algorithm parameters and also show that Markov blanket and causal graph concepts can be used to understand deviations from optimality of state-of-the-art non-causal algorithms. The present paper also introduces the following extensions to the core GLL framework: parallel and distributed versions of GLL algorithms. versions with false discovery rate control. strategies for constructing novel heuristics for specific domains. and divide-and-conquer local-to-global learning (LGL) strategies. We test the generality of the LGL approach by deriving a novel LGL-based algorithm that compares favorably c 2010 Constantin F. Aliferis. Alexander Statnikov. Ioannis Tsamardinos.

This chapter provides a broad-based introduction to hybrid systems and discusses a number of topics of ongoing research.Hybrid systems are systems that exhibit both continuous-time and discrete-event dynamics. In the former case. the dynamics can be defined by differential or difference equations. For the latter. common representations include finite state machines and Petri nets. A good example of hybrid dynamics is multimode behavior.

Although it is typical to assume knowledge of at least some nonlocal information when studying secure and fault-tolerant consensus algorithms. this assumption is not suitable for large-scale dynamic networks. To remedy this. we emphasize the use of local strategies to deal with resilience to security breaches. We study a consensus protocol that uses only local information and we consider worst-case security breaches. where the compromised nodes have full knowledge of the network and the intentions of the other nodes. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the normal nodes to reach consensus despite the influence of the malicious nodes under different threat assumptions.

In this paper. through micro-benchmarks. we find that fingerprint-based approaches are preferable in scenarios where a dense database is available; while model-based approaches are the method of choice in the case of sparse data. It should be noted. however. that practical situations are complex. A single deployment often features both sparse and dense sampled areas. Furthermore. the internal layout affects the propagation of radio signals and exhibits environmental impacts. A certain number of measurement samples may be sufficient for one part of the building. but entirely insufficient for another.

Karlsson,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.02141v2,,,,Named entity recognition (NER) in Chinese is essential but difficult because of the lack of natural delimiters. Therefore. Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) is usually considered as the first step for Chinese NER. However. models based on word-level embeddings and lexicon features often suffer from segmentation errors and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In this paper. we investigate a Convolutional Attention Network called CAN for Chinese NER. which consists of a character-based convolutional neural network (CNN) with local-attention layer and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with global self-attention layer to capture the information from adjacent characters and sentence contexts. Also. compared to other models. not depending on any external resources like lexicons and employing small size of char embeddings make our model more practical. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods without word embedding and external lexicon resources on different domain datasets including Weibo.

1107962,Applying a plan-recognition/plan-generation paradigm to interactive storytelling,2006,Börje Karlsson and Angelo EM Ciarlini and Bruno Feijó and Antonio L Furtado,,,,31,,A key issue in interactive storytelling is how to generate stories which are. at the same time. interesting and coherent. On the one hand. it is desirable to provide means for the user to intervene in the story. But. on the other hand. it is necessary to guarantee that user intervention will not introduce events that violate the rules of the intended genre. This paper describes the usage of a plan recognition/plan generation paradigm in LOGTELL. a logic-based tool for the interactive generation and dramatization of stories. We focus on the specification of a formal logic model for events and characters' behaviour and on how the tool helps the interactive composition of plots through the adaptation of fully or partially generated plots. Based on the model. the user can interact with the tool at various levels. obtaining a variety of stories agreeable to individual tastes. within the imposed coherence requirements. The system alternates stages of goal inference. planning. plan recognition. user intervention and 3D visualization.

Karlsson,,,,,,The dominant approaches for named entity recognitionm (NER) mostly adopt complex recurrent neural networks (RNN). eg. long-short-term-memory (LSTM). However. RNNs are limited by their recurrent nature in terms of computational efficiency. In contrast. convolutional neural networks (CNN) can fully exploit the GPU parallelism with their feedforward architectures. However. little attention has been paid to performing NER with CNNs. mainly owing to their difficulties in capturing the long-term context information in a sequence. In this paper. we propose a simple but effective CNN-based network for NER. ie. gated relation network (GRN). which is more capable than common CNNs in capturing long-term context. Specifically. in GRN we firstly employ CNNs to explore the local context features of each word. Then we model the relations between words and use them as gates to fuse local context features into global ones for predicting labels. Without using recurrent layers that process a sentence in a sequential manner. our GRN allows computations to be performed in parallel across the entire sentence. Experiments on two benchmark NER datasets (ie. CoNLL2003 and Ontonotes 5.0) show that. our proposed GRN can achieve state-of-the-art performance with or without external knowledge.

To this end. we present a meta-learning algorithm to find a good model parameter initialization that could fast adapt to the given test case and propose to construct multiple pseudo-NER tasks for meta-training by computing sentence similarities. To further improve the model's generalization ability across different languages. we introduce a masking scheme and augment the loss function with an additional maximum term during meta-training.

1107976,Single-/Multi-Source Cross-Lingual NER via Teacher-Student Learning on Unlabeled Data in Target Language,2020,Qianhui Wu and Zijia Lin and Börje F. Karlsson and Jian-Guang Lou and Biqing Huang,,,,,,To better tackle the named entity recognition (NER) problem on languages with little/no labeled data. cross-lingual NER must effectively leverage knowledge learned from source languages with rich labeled data. Previous works on cross-lingual NER are mostly based on label projection with pairwise texts or direct model transfer. However. such methods either are not applicable if the labeled data in the source languages is unavailable. or do not leverage information contained in unlabeled data in the target language. In this paper. we propose a teacher-student learning method to address such limitations. where NER models in the source languages are used as teachers to train a student model on unlabeled data in the target language. The proposed method works for both single-source and multi-source cross-lingual NER. For the latter. we further propose a similarity measuring method to better weight the supervision from different teacher models. Extensive experiments for 3 target languages on benchmark datasets well demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for both single-source and multi-source cross-lingual NER.,True,ZWmz_kMAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12440,8454768043778506321,/scholar?cites=8454768043778506321,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12440,0,0,0

Creating and distributing apps has never been more accessible. Even single developers can now reach global audiences. But mobile apps must cope with extremely varied and dynamic operating conditions due to factors like diverse device characteristics. wireless network heterogeneity. and varied user behavior. App developers and operators of app marketplaces both lack testing tools that can effectively account for such diversity and. as a result. app failures and performance bugs (like excessive energy consumption) are commonly found today.

Every test input needs to be run with a variety of contexts. such as: device heterogeneity. wireless network speeds. locations. and unpredictable sensor inputs. The range of values for each context. eg location. can be very large. In this paper we present a one of a kind cloud service. called ConVirt. to which app developers can submit their apps for testing. It leverages two key techniques to make app testing more tractable:(i) pruning the input space into representative contexts. and (ii) prioritizing the context test space to quickly discover failure scenarios for each app. We have implemented ConVirt as a cluster of VMs that can each emulate various combinations of contexts for tablet and phone apps. We evaluate ConVirt by testing 230 commercially available mobile apps based on a comprehensive library of real-world conditions.

In this paper. we find a serious vulnerability of existing data perturbation algorithms that an adversary may exploit to restore other users' private information (e.g.. mean. variance and the distribution of original data) from the perturbed data. because all the participants share the same noise distribution.

Creating the illusion of immersion for a near-eye display results in very heavy rendering workloads: low latency. high framerate. and high visual quality are all needed. Tethered VR setups in which the HMD is bound to a powerful gaming desktop limit mobility and exploration. and are difficult to deploy widely.

1108022,Accessing hardware devices using web server abstractions,2017,James Mickens and David Chu and Li Zhuang and Kaisen Lin,,,,,,In the new architecture. a client that desires access to a piece of hardware sends HTTP requests to a device server. The server receives a HTTP requests. accesses a device on behalf of the client. and send the device's response back to the client in the form of an HTTP response. This architecture has three primary advantages. First. it offers a clean interface for clients where all devices are accessed as if they are web servers. Second. it helps make devices more secure whereby clients can be prevented from accessing hardware directly. and all device access is forced through the narrow HTTP access protocol and checked for compliance with a desired security policy. Third. since HTTP allows local and remote servers to be contacted. the proposed architecture makes it easy for clients to communicate with devices that are not physically co-resident with the client but which are accessible via a network connection.,True,MDRALDkAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,75,https://patents.google.com/patent/US9716743B2/en,15919833938636435429,/scholar?cites=15919833938636435429,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/42/60/6b/36f0ec72973aff/US9716743.pdf,0,0,0

1108043,A theory of discontinuities in physical system models,1998,Pieter J Mosterman and Gautam Biswas,335,Journal of the Franklin Institute,3,401-439,Pergamon,Physical systems are by nature continuous. but often display nonlinear behaviors that make them hard to analyze. Typically. these nonlinearities occur at a time scale that is much smaller than the time scale at which gross system behavior needs to be described. In other situations. nonlinear effects are small and of a parasitic nature. To achieve efficiency and clarity in building complex system models. and to reduce computational complexity in the analysis of system behavior. modelers often abstract away any parasitic component parameter effects. and analyze the system at more abstract time scales. However. these abstractions often introduce abrupt. instantaneous changes in system behavior.

This paper presents an exploratory data mining methodology for assessing and comparing students’ learning behaviors from these interaction traces. The core algorithm employs a novel combination of sequence mining techniques to identify differentially frequent patterns between groups of students (eg. experimental versus control conditions or high versus low performers). We extend this technique by contextualizing the sequence mining with information about the student’s performance over the course of the learning interactions. Specifically. we employ a piecewise linear segmentation algorithm in concert with the differential sequence mining technique to identify and compare segments of students’ productive and unproductive learning behaviors. We present the results from the application of this exploratory data mining methodology to learning interaction trace data gathered during a recent middle school class study with the Betty’s Brain learning environment.

These are initiated by disturbances in the entrance region of a pipe flow. and grow in length in the axial direction as they move downstream. Sequences of slugs merge at some distance from the pipe inlet to finally form the state of fully developed turbulent pipe flow. This formation process is generally known. but the randomness in time of naturally occurring slug formation does not permit detailed study of slug flows. For this reason. a special test facility was developed and built for detailed investigation of deterministically generated slugs in pipe flows. It is also employed to generate the puff flows at lower Reynolds numbers. The results reveal a high degree of reproducibility with which the triggering device is able to produce puffs.

In this paper. we propose an autonomous and collaborative RSS fingerprint collection and localization system. Mobile users track their position with inertial sensors and measure RSS from the surrounding access points. In this scenario. anonymous mobile users automatically collect data in daily life without purposefully surveying an entire building. The server progressively builds up a precise radio map as more users interact with their fingerprint data. The time drift error of inertial sensors is also compromised at run-time with the fingerprint-based localization. which runs with the collective fingerprints being currently built by the server. The proposed system has been implemented on a recent …,True,5APW4zDlaesC:d1gkVwhDpl0C,151,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5675696/,3042121430739404485,/scholar?cites=3042121430739404485,,,0,0,0
1108068,Understanding the coverage and scalability of place-centric crowdsensing,2013,Yohan Chon and Nicholas D Lane and Yunjong Kim and Feng Zhao and Hojung Cha,,,,3-12,,Crowd-enabled place-centric systems gather and reason over large mobile sensor datasets and target everyday user locations (such as stores. workplaces. and restaurants). Such systems are transforming various consumer services (for example. local search) and data-driven organizations (city planning).

Thus. new content sharing mechanisms should be developed as traditional data delivery schemes are not efficient for content sharing due to the sporadic connectivity between smartphones. To accomplish data delivery in such challenging environments. researchers have proposed the use of store-carry-forward protocols. in which a node stores a message and carries it until a forwarding opportunity arises through an encounter with other nodes. Most previous works in this field have focused on the prediction of whether two nodes would encounter each other. without considering the place and time of the encounter.
