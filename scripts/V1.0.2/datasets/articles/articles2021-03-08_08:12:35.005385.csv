1169074,The locality principle,2006,Peter J Denning,,,,43-67,,Locality is among the oldest systems principles in computer science. It was discovered in 1967 during efforts to make early virtual memory systems work well. It is a package of three ideas: (1) computational processes pass through a sequence of locality sets and reference only within them. (2) the locality sets can be inferred by applying a distance function to a program's address trace observed during a backward window. and (3) memory management is optimal when it guarantees each program that its locality sets will be present in high-speed memory. Working set memory management was the first exploitation of this principle; it prevented thrashing while maintaining near optimal system throughput. and eventually it enabled virtual memory systems to be reliable. dependable. and transparent. Many researchers and system designers rallied around the effort to understand locality and achieve this outcome.

Crisp input and output data are fundamentally indispensable in conventional DEA. However. the observed values of the input and output data in real-world problems are sometimes imprecise or vague. Many researchers have proposed various fuzzy methods for dealing with the imprecise and ambiguous data in DEA. In this study. we provide a taxonomy and review of the fuzzy DEA methods. We present a classification scheme with four primary categories. namely. the tolerance approach. the α-level based approach. the fuzzy ranking approach and the possibility approach.

One cause of inter-temporal dependence between input and output levels is capital stock which influences output levels over many production periods. Such units cannot be assessed by traditional or ‘static’ DEA which assumes input–output correspondences are contemporaneous in the sense that the output levels observed in a time period are the product solely of the input levels observed during that same period. The method developed in the paper overcomes the problem of inter-temporal input–output dependence by using input–output ‘paths’ mapped out by operating units over time as the basis of assessing them.

Ltd.,This paper explores the relationship between cost and quality of hospital care. A total operating cost function is estimated for 137 US Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals for 1988–1993 using three rate‐based measures of quality as regressors. The high likelihood of the existence of measurement error in quality in the cross section leads to the application of novel instrumental variable techniques. Results suggest that mortality and readmission indices are adjusted inadequately for illness severity. The measure on the failure to follow up inpatient discharges with outpatient care. however. appears to increase cost. The results of this paper underscore a number of practical difficulties and challenges facing government or other systems in evaluating the relative performance of their hospitals.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Maindiratta (1990) questioned the usefulness of the concept of scale efficiency in production as the most productive scale size (MPSS) usually requires altering the scale of output produced. If the decision making unit (DMU) is required to deliver a specific output bundle. then altering output along with the input scale to reach the MPSS is not a valid recommendation. He proposed a measure of the size efficiency of a DMU. In this paper. we apply Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to examine the levels of technical. scale. and size efficiency of individual nursing homes providing health care to the elderly.

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has become one of the preeminent non-parametric methods for measuring efficiency and productivity of decision making units. DEA models are now employed routinely in areas that range from assessment of public sectors such as hospitals and healthcare systems. schools and universities to private sectors such as banks and financial institutions. The advantage of DEA is to accommodate multiple inputs and multiple outputs for measuring the relative efficiencies of a set of homogeneous decision making units (DMUs).One limitation of the conventional DEA models is that they can only handle crisp input and output data.

The methods used to estimate cost functions in higher education institutions have undergone significant development over the last two decades. The developments include the identification of functional forms that accommodate the possibility of synergies in the production of multiple outputs such as teaching and research. and also the adoption of estimation methodologies that are suited to the analysis of cost frontiers using modern panel datasets. The aim of this report is critically to evaluate these developments and then to apply state-of-the-art techniques to the analysis of cost structures in English higher education institutions. An advantage of the frontier techniques used in this report is that they arguably estimate the boundaries of the cost function. even though data on institutions’ expenditures used in the analysis may include inefficiency. determined as they are partly by formula. 12. The analysis of costs in multiproduct organisations requires the adoption of a family of concepts related to the familiar concept of economies of scale. Scale in a multiproduct organisation is not easy to define. since such organisations do not typically produce the same mix of outputs. As an example. one university may produce many undergraduates and few postgraduates. while another may produce few undergraduates and many postgraduates; it is not clear which is the larger. So concepts of economies of scale need to be refined. We therefore define ray economies of scale and product-specific economies of scale. and also the concept of economies of scope which captures the gains or otherwise associated with production of multiple outputs within a single …,True,iTDEG2wAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,74,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_Emrouznejad/publication/215785113_An_Exploratory_Analysis_of_the_Cost_Structure_of_Higher_Education_in_England/links/0912f50a11f73bfb27000000.pdf,1250739417746861228,/scholar?cites=1250739417746861228,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_Emrouznejad/publication/215785113_An_Exploratory_Analysis_of_the_Cost_Structure_of_Higher_Education_in_England/links/0912f50a11f73bfb27000000.pdf,0,0,0

Since. some characteristics such as colour. morphology and texture show the difference of objects. Therefore. it is necessary that these parameters should be used by machine vision for reorganization of different objects from each other. In this study. identification of four major weed seeds (common vetch. cleavers. cornflower and great bur-parsley). that are widely found in farms of West and North West of Iran. was done by digital image analysis. Recognizing and removing the weed seeds from the main product is very important. By recognizing the weed seed species from each other. it is possible to determine the percentage of farm pollution to each of weed seeds. and then weed control operations will be applied. The value of products is determined through ratio of weed seeds weight to total weight. Therefore. recognition of weed seed species as the first step in determination of products value is very important. For this purpose. by using a chamber of imaging. some uniform images of samples were acquired. Then. a program was coded in Matlab software for segmentation of the samples.

Sufficient amount and efficient use of these energies are requirements for sustainable wheat production. This study therefore focuses on estimating energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in rainfed wheat production in Kohgilouye-BoyerAhmad province of Iran during the years 2008-2010. The input farm resources and output wheat yield were transformed to forms of energy by multiplying them with their corresponding energy coefficient. To evaluate performance of wheat production. energy indices such as energy ratio. energy productivity. specific energy and net energy were calculated. GHG emission was calculated by multiplying the application rate of inputs by its corresponding emission coefficient. Analysis of energy indicators in wheat production revealed that energy use efficiency. energy productivity and net energy had increasing trend during the studied years. The average value of energy use efficiency. energy productivity and net energy were 2.13. 2.15 kg MJ-1 and 8585.87 MJ ha-1 in 2010. Analysis of GHG emission showed that total emission in wheat production was 280.57 kg CO2 eq ha-1 and nitrogen fertilizer. diesel fuel and phosphate fertilizer had the highest contribution in producing GHG emission. respectively.

Tomato is a plant which its fruit does not ripe simultaneously. therefore it is necessary to develop an algorithm to distinguish red tomatoes. In the current study. a new segmentation algorithm based on region growing was proposed for guiding a robot to pick up red tomatoes. For this purpose. several colour images of tomato plants were acquired in a greenhouse. The colour images of tomato were captured under natural light. without any artificial lighting equipment. To recognize red tomatoes form non-red ones. at first background of images were removed. For removing the background. subtraction of red and green components (RG) was applied. Usually tomatoes touch together. so separating touching tomatoes was next step. In this step. the watershed algorithm was used that was followed by improving process. Afterwards. red tomato was detected by the region growing approach.

1169152,ESTIMATING THE EFFICIENCY OF PAHANG RUBBER SMALLHOLDERS USING DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS APPROACH,2016,F Zulkipli N Ali and NA Ramli,78,Jurnal Teknologi,12-3,147-153,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,RISDA has targeted for the income of each smallholder to be at least RM2500 per month by the end of 2015. However. approximately almost 90% of the smallholdersâ€™ monthly income is still below the target. Hence. in order to observe if this target is achievable. a study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency level of producing rubber among 95 rubber smallholders in Pahang. In addition. the study also investigated if there was any opportunity for increment of production among the rubber smallholders. Therefore. the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model. under the assumption of Variable Return to Scale (VRS) and Constant Return to Scale (CRS). was used to analyse the scale and the technical efficiency of the smallholders. Scale Efficiency was measured in order to estimate the return to scale of the smallholders. As a result. the study found that the average Overall Technical Efficiency (OTE) and Pure Technical Efficiency (PTE) scores of the smallholders were 43.47% and 43.78%. respectively. Thus. the majority of the smallholders were not technically efficient in producing rubber. Furthermore. based on the return to scale estimated. 41% of the smallholders were operating under the Increase Return to Scale (IRS). which implied that the smallholders had a sub-optimal scale size. The results obtained had been useful as the optimal input-output for the efficient rubber yield can be determined and may help RISDA. as well as agricultural planners. to devise a strategy in order to increase the productivity of rubber smallholders in Malaysia.

1169155,A Study on Environmental Efficiency of the Manufacturing Sector in Malaysia using Data Envelopment Analysis,2010,N Ramli and S Munisamy,,,,,ICOQSIA,The manufacturing sector has been a major driver of growth for the Malaysian economy. Productivity and efficiency enhancement of the manufacturing sector is especially crucial for the continuous growth and development of the economy. This paper aims to evaluate the environmental and technical efficiencies in the manufacturing sector in Malaysia. Manufacturing activities produce pollutants that can contribute to poor environmental performance and are regarded as undesirable outputs. Thus. it would be incomplete to measure the efficiency of manufacturing activities without considering the undesirable outputs. For that reason. this study demonstrates the usefulness of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique in measuring efficiency by taking into account undesirable outputs. The results indicate that the manufacturing industries in the states of Labuan and Sarawak are the most efficient.

The objective of this study is to measure the technical efficiency scores as well as the effectiveness of the Malaysian banking sector. and thus. determine their overall performance. The study analyzes the performance of the Malaysian banking sector. which comprises two types of bank. namely commercial banks and Islamic banks. The study covers the period of 2011 to 2015. A two-stage analysis of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been used in this study. The results of the analysis show that the average efficiency scores are greater than the average effectiveness scores for both types of bank for the years 2011 until 2015. while conventional banks perform better than Islamic banks. An efficient bank does not always equate to it being more effective. Together. these two factors reflect the overall performance of a bank.

1169157,Modeling undesirable factors in efficiency evaluation with an application to the Malaysian manufacturing sector/Noor Asiah bt Ramli,2013,Noor Asiah Ramli,,,,,,Efficiency measurement must reflect the realities of production activities. In the manufacturing sector. emissions from fossil fuel combustion. which are acknowledged as being undesirable outputs. should be taken into account in efficiency measurement. since they are produced jointly with desirable outputs. This type of measurement is referred to as eco-efficiency. To analyze eco-efficiency. the Directional Distance Function (DDF) has been a popular approach. However. there is a drawback to the DDF model where the direction vector to the production boundary is fixed arbitrarily. and. hence. may not provide the best efficiency measures. The main purpose of this study is twofold. First. to introduce a new slack-based measure of efficiency called the Directional Slack-based Distance Function (DSDF) model and deploy it to calculate productivity change using the Malmquist Luenberger Productivity Index (MLPI). Second. is to apply the DSDF model to analyze the productivity change in the Malaysian manufacturing sector over the period 2001 to 2010. The regional analysis is conducted on 15 Malaysian states which are categorized into Free Industrial Zone (FIZ) and Non-Free Industrial Zone (N-FIZ) states. Two inputs and two outputs are employed. The inputs are operating expenditure and capital while the desirable and undesirable outputs are sales and carbon dioxide (CO2). respectively.

There is a statistical and empirical rule that if the number of performance measures is high in comparison with the number of units. then a large percentage of the units will be determined as efficient. which is obviously a questionable result.

DEA and Discriminant Analysis (DA) are similar in classifying units to exhibit either good or poor performance. On the other hand. selecting the most efficient unit between several efficient ones is one of the main issues in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM).

1169196,Are selling. general. and administrative costs “sticky”?,2003,Mark C Anderson and Rajiv D Banker and Surya N Janakiraman,41,Journal of accounting research,1,47-63,Blackwell Publishing Inc,A fundamental assumption in cost accounting is that the relation between costs and volume is symmetric for volume increases and decreases. In this study. we investigate whether costs are “sticky”—that is. whether costs increase more when activity rises than they decrease when activity falls by an equivalent amount. We find. for 7.629 firms over 20 years. that selling. general. and administrative (SG&A) costs increase on average 0.55% per 1% increase in sales but decrease only 0.35% per 1% decrease in sales. Our analysis compares the traditional model of cost behavior in which costs move proportionately with changes in activity with an alternative model in which sticky costs occur because managers deliberately adjust the resources committed to activities. We test hypotheses about the properties of sticky costs and how the degree of stickiness of SG&A costs varies with firm circumstances.,True,oCjgbUgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1325,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-679X.00095,2488863596299102218,/scholar?cites=2488863596299102218,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.17.5331&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1169197,Maximum likelihood. consistency and data envelopment analysis: a statistical foundation,1993,Rajiv D Banker,39,Management science,10,1265-1273,INFORMS,This paper provides a formal statistical basis for the efficiency evaluation techniques of data envelopment analysis (DEA). DEA estimators of the best practice monotone increasing and concave production function are shown to be also maximum likelihood estimators if the deviation of actual output from the efficient output is regarded as a stochastic variable with a monotone decreasing probability density function.While the best practice frontier estimator is biased below the theoretical frontier for a finite sample size. the bias approaches zero for large samples. The DEA estimators exhibit the desirable asymptotic property of consistency. and the asymptotic distribution of the DEA estimators of inefficiency deviations is identical to the true distribution of these deviations. This result is then employed to suggest possible statistical tests of hypotheses based on asymptotic distributions.,True,oCjgbUgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1158,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.39.10.1265,88048206344273029,/scholar?cites=88048206344273029,,https://mycourses.aalto.fi/pluginfile.php/1218680/mod_resource/intro/Banker_1993_MS.pdf,0,0,0

Booth School of Business. University of Chicago. Wiley,Several accounting and other signals are generally available for the construction of a managerial performance evaluation measure on which an optimal compensation contract is based. The demand for aggregation in evaluating managerial performance arises because reporting all the basic transactions and other nonfinancial information about performance is costly and impracticable (see Ashton [1982]. Casey [1978]. and Holmstrom and Milgrom [1987]). We identify necessary and sufficient conditions on the joint density function of the signals under which linear aggregation. a simple and commonly employed way to construct a per-formance evaluation measure. is optimal. This characterization suggests that the linear form of aggregation is optimal for a large class of situations.

It accomplishes this by developing peer groups for each unit being operated. The use of categorical variables is an important extension which can improve the peer group construction process and incorporate “on-off” characteristics. e.g.. presence of drive-in window or not in a banking network. It relaxes the stringent need for factors to display piecewise constant marginal productivities. In so doing. it substantially strengthens the credibility of the insights obtained.

1169219,What organizational culture types enable and retard open innovation?,2015,M Muzamil Naqshbandi and Sharan Kaur and Pin Ma,49,Quality & Quantity,5,2123-2144,Springer Netherlands,Research suggests that cultural issues can make or mar the open innovation process. In this paper. we thus aim at identifying organizational culture types that enable and retard the two types of open innovation activities: in-bound and out-bound. Data were collected using the questionnaire survey method from 339 middle and top managers working in the Malaysian high-tech sector. Organizational culture emerged as a huge predictor of open innovation. We found that highly integrative culture enables in-bound open innovation. but does not significantly affect out-bound open innovation. Besides. hierarchy culture is found to retard both in-bound and out-bound open innovation. This paper is probably the first to empirically investigate the role of culture in open innovation.

Open innovation paradigm answers this need by utilizing larger resources and expertise that firms involved in the open innovation process offer. Given the recency of the concept of open innovation. the factors that influence the creation of open innovation are hazy. Most of the research on open innovation looks at the"" hard"" aspects of organizations. while the soft issues stand less researched. This conceptual paper draws attention to two such aspects of organization: organizational citizenship behaviour and organizational structure. This paper proposes that practicing organizational citizenship behaviours by the employees enhances the chances of creation of open innovation while not doing so can botch up the whole exercise particularly during the infancy stage. It is also proposed that informal organizational structures favour creation of innovation in the open innovation paradigm more than the rigid formal structures. It is further argued that besides proper citizenship behaviours and informal structures. firms need to achieve strategic resonance with suppliers and customers to create successful open innovation.

Unfortunately. this interaction is often small since the evanescent field is a fraction of the total optical field. Here we propose and demonstrate. through simulation and experiment. how the waveguide evanescent field can be enhanced substantially by using high index interface layers. which draw out the optical field in the probe vicinity taking advantage of field localisation. This can be further enhanced by extended resonant and gallery modes within the channels of a structured cylindrical waveguide. Several orders of magnitude increased sensitivity with minimal added insertion loss is obtained using self-assembled layers of TiO_2 (B) nanoparticles and porphyrin within a silica structured optical fibre.

Properly efficient solutions are one of the most important theoretical and practical concepts that represent the behavior of the objective functions during a process change. Actually. these solutions are those efficient solutions that filter the anomalies of objective functions at some points. and this will help the manager to decision making to choose more important solutions. One of the most important tools for obtaining solutions with bounded trade-off in multi-objective optimization field is the Sum weighted scalarization method. which many authors have been studying it in interactive optimization field. This paper provides a method for obtaining properly efficient solutions near the ideal point with a theoretical and interactive view and using Sum weighted scalarization method.

En segundo lugar. la eficiencia cruzada de cada una de las otras unidades tiene la menor desviación de la eficiencia CCR de la misma unidad. Por tanto. se obtienen pesos óptimos que tienen la menor dispersión. Como resultado. se evitan en la medida de lo posible las ponderaciones óptimas cero que conducen a la trivialidad del índice relevante. Por lo tanto. utilizando la eficiencia cruzada promedio. los resultados de la clasificación serían más razonables.

Limited-memory algorithms are widely used to solve large-scale problems. while Rang Kuta's methods are also used to solve numerical differential equations. In this paper. using the concept of sub-space method and fixed-step length and integration of line-search and trust-region techniques. an ODE-based hybrid method is proposed for solving large-scale optimization problems. Since the line-search methods may require more iteration for convergence. while Trust-region methods also require a lot of iteration to solve the constrained sub problem. a new class of methods is proposed in this way. which combines the best features of trust-region and line-search methods. The main feature of the proposed method is that the linear equation system is solved only once in order to obtain the experimental step.,True,_i4BLhIAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,http://jamlu.liau.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=1511&sid=1&slc_lang=en&ftxt=0,,,,http://jamlu.liau.ac.ir/files/site1/user_files_088e30/fmodarres-A-10-1242-2-2937c2d.pdf,0,0,0

Islamic Azad University,In assessing the relative efficiency of decision-maker units by classical Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models. the status of the data is determined from the input or output points of views. In real issues. there are some data whose statuses are debatable. Some decision making units consider them as input to achieve higher efficiency while some other decision making units consider them as output. but these data are known as flexible variables. Thus. these data are known as flexible variables. Several parametric and non-parametric models have been introduced for categorizing such data. In most of the status-oriented models (input or output based) introduced to determine the status of flexible data. different statuses of a model can produce different results in determining the statuses of the flexible variable. In non-status models. the value of M is also used to select the main constraint and to remove the waste constraints. In these models. by choosing different values for M. different results are achieved in determining the status of the flexible variable. the efficiency and return to scale of decision-making units. To solve these problems in DEA. a non-status model is proposed which. in addition to determining the status of the flexible variable. can obviate the computational error. and the problems caused by the presence of M in the model. The advantages of the proposed model are compared with other models with an empirical example.,True,_i4BLhIAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,http://jnrm.srbiau.ac.ir/article_13228.html,,,,http://jnrm.srbiau.ac.ir/article_13228_48b2132e59251eab62ccff3a9dbcbd99.pdf,0,0,0

Currently the primary object of airport air quality are the nitrogen oxides and particle matter (PM10. PM2. 5 and ultrafine PM) emissions from aircraft engine exhausts as initiators of photochemical smog and regional haze. which may further impact on human health. Analysis of PM emission inventory results at major European airports highlighted on sufficiently high contribution of aircraft engines and APU. The paper aims to summarize the knowledge on particle size distributions. particle effective density. morphology and internal structure of aircraft PM. these properties are critical for understanding of the fate and potential health impact of PM. It also aims to describe the basic methods for calculation of emission and dispersion of PM. produced by aircrafts under the LTO operations. Methods: analytical solution of the atmospheric diffusion equation is used to calculate the maximum PM concentration from point emission source. The PM concentration varies inversely proportional to the wind velocity u1 and directly proportional to the vertical component of the turbulent exchange coefficient k1/u1. The evaluation of non-volatile PM concentration includes the size and shape of PM.

1169496,Thermal modeling of solid oxide fuel-cell based biomass gasification systems,2009,Can Ozgur Colpan,,,,,,In this thesis. several models of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) were developed in cell and system levels. These models were used in several case studies to simulate the performance of the cells and systems studied. In addition. the effectiveness of SOFC in reducing greenhouse gases was assessed through a case study.In cell level. a thermodynamic model. a carbon deposition model. and a quasi 2-D transient heat transfer model were developed. The thermodynamic model is capable of determining the performance of a SOFC including polarization curve. power output. and electrical efficiency. This model takes into account the recirculation of depleted fuel and internal reforming processes. The original model was improved by addressing problems associated with carbon deposition. The occurrence of carbon deposition was investigated using CH-0 triangular phase diagrams and calculation of carbon activities. More detailed modeling of SOFC was accomplished by including the heat transfer mechanisms inside the fuel cell such as conduction. convection and radiation. In this heat transfer model. the transient behaviour of the cell was simulated during the heat-up and start-up stages. Several parametric studies. such as effect of Reynolds number and excess air coefficient on the performance of the cell. were conducted to better examine co-and counter-flow configurations of SOFC.,True,ZPSxIJYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,23,https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/865ba71b-728d-4271-b701-43e25f298cad/etd_pdf/3e2128a3b9d4b56ccad958ecbaa6df05/colpan-thermalmodelingofsolidoxidefuelcellbasedbiomass.pdf,15004378479641924028,/scholar?cites=15004378479641924028,,https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/865ba71b-728d-4271-b701-43e25f298cad/etd_pdf/3e2128a3b9d4b56ccad958ecbaa6df05/colpan-thermalmodelingofsolidoxidefuelcellbasedbiomass.pdf,0,0,0

These two flow fields. as well as a conventional serpentine flow field (S-FF. used as a reference). were examined as possible anode and cathode flow field candidates. To examine the performance of each of these candidates. each flow field was manufactured and experimentally tested under different anode and cathode flow rate combinations (1.3 mL/min [methanol] and 400 mL/min [oxygen]. as well as 2 and 3 times these flow rates). and different methanol concentrations (0.50 M. 0.75 M. and 1.00 M).

The physics of this fuel cell are examined and discussed for varied anode and cathode inlet temperatures. with particular emphasis being placed on the non-isothermal behavior of this fuel cell. The results show that the cathode's thermal entrance length is much larger than that of the anode's. and that the cathode's inlet temperature influences the overall cell temperature more significantly than that of the anode's. This was found to be primarily due to the cathode's high velocity and molecular diffusivity. which allowed for a high degree of convective cooling. This effect was found to cause the mid-plane temperature to be ∼10 °C lower than that of the set point temperature for the coldest air inlet temperature of 40 °C …,True,ZPSxIJYAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,20,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319916314495,5781243065880595196,/scholar?cites=5781243065880595196,,,0,0,0

1169628,A Supervisory Control Strategy for Improving Energy Efficiency of Artificial Lighting Systems in Greenhouses,2021,Gianluca Serale and Luca Gnoli and Emanuele Giraudo and Enrico Fabrizio,14,Energies,1,202,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Artificial lighting systems are used in commercial greenhouses to ensure year-round yields. Current Light Emitting Diode (LED) technologies improved the system efficiency. Nevertheless. having artificial lighting systems extended for hectares with power densities over 50 W/m 2 causes energy and power demand of greenhouses to be really significant. The present paper introduces an innovative supervisory and predictive control strategy to optimize the energy performance of the artificial lights of greenhouses. The controller has been implemented in a multi-span plastic greenhouse located in North Italy. The proposed control strategy has been tested on a greenhouse of 1 hectare with a lighting system with a nominal power density of 50 W m− 2 requiring an overall power supply of 1 M W for a period of 80 days. The results have been compared with the data coming from another greenhouse of 1 hectare in the same conditions implementing a state-of-the-art strategy for artificial lighting control. Results outlines that potential 19.4% cost savings are achievable. Moreover. the algorithm can be used to transform the greenhouse in a viable source of energy flexibility for grid reliability.

Although many steps forward have been made by community energy around the world and especially in the EU. there are still many barriers and entry obstacles that do not allow a revolution in the energy market. In this paper. various aspects that distinguish a community energy have been explored. After presenting a state of the art on the development of community energy in Europe. the technologies supporting these cooperative realities were studied. This work reports a complete analysis on renewable energy production systems. community management software and the most innovative user engagement tools. This paper also presents the results of a survey. with the aim of studying how people can be more involved in the energy market.

1169630,Innovative solar energy technologies and control algorithms for enhancing demand-side management in buildings,2020,Gianluca Serale,,,,,,The present thesis investigates innovative energy technologies and control algorithms for enhancing demand-side management in buildings. The work focuses on an innovative low-temperature solar thermal system for supplying space heating demand of buildings. This technology is used as a case study to explore possible solutions to fulfil the mismatch between energy production and its exploitation in building. This shortcoming represents the primary issue of renewable energy sources. Technologies enhancing the energy storage capacity and active demandside management or demand-response strategies must be implemented in buildings. For these purposes. it is possible to employ hardware or software solutions. The hardware solutions for thermal demand response of buildings are those technologies that allow the energy loads to be permanently shifted or mitigated. The software solutions for demand response are those that integrate an intelligent supervisory layer in the building automation (or management) systems. The present thesis approaches the problem from both the hardware technologies side and the software solutions side. This approach enables the mutual relationships and interactions between the strategies to be appropriately measured. The thesis can be roughly divided in two parts. The first part of the thesis focuses on an innovative solar thermal system exploiting a novel heat transfer fluid and storage media based on micro-encapsulated Phase Change Material slurry. This material leads the system to enhance latent heat exchange processes and increasing the overall performance.

1169631,Numerical Model for Solar Thermal Collectors and Thermal Energy Storages Based on Phase Change Slurry,2017,Gaia Prearo and Gianluca Serale and Marco Perino,,,,,,The efficiency of conventional solar thermal collectors and related thermal energy storages is often reduced by the requirement for high irradiation levels and the heat losses due to the relatively high temperature of the heat transfer fluid. In order to overcome those limitations. a solar thermal system capable of working at low temperatures through the exploitation of latent heat storage is presented in this paper. The proposed system was based on a novel heat transfer fluid and storage media. composed by a mixture of water and microencapsulated phase change material (PCM). named Phase Change Slurry (PCS). This paper introduces a numerical model capable of accurately describe the physical process and the dynamics of the proposed technology (collector. thermal energy storage and control logics). Results were validated by means of experimental tests and a long-term monitoring on a real full-scale prototype. Furthermore. experimental tests were performed to carry out the actual PCS thermo-dynamical properties that are strongly dependent on the concentration of micro-capsules in the heat transfer fluid.,True,Per3KHsAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC,0,http://proceedings.ises.org/paper/swc2017/swc2017-0212-Prearo.pdf,,,,http://proceedings.ises.org/paper/swc2017/swc2017-0212-Prearo.pdf,0,0,0

MPC has found successful implementation in building thermal regulation. fully exploiting the potential of building thermal mass. Moreover. MPC has been positively applied to active energy storage systems. as well as to the optimal management of on-site renewable energy sources. MPC also opens up several opportunities for enhancing energy efficiency in the operation of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems because of its ability to consider constraints. prediction of disturbances and multiple conflicting objectives. such as indoor thermal comfort and building energy demand. Despite the application of MPC algorithms in building control has been thoroughly investigated in various works. a unified framework that fully describes and formulates the implementation is still lacking. Firstly. this work introduces a common dictionary and taxonomy that gives a common ground to all the engineering disciplines involved in building design and control. Secondly the main scope of this paper is to define the MPC formulation framework and critically discuss the outcomes of different existing MPC algorithms for building and HVAC system management. The potential benefits of the application of MPC in improving energy efficiency in buildings were highlighted.

The total energy request in buildings can be significantly reduced by detecting abnormal consumption effectively. Numerous models are used to tackle this problem but either they are very complex and mostly applicable to components level. or they cannot be adopted for different buildings and equipment. In this study a simplified approach to automatically detect anomalies in building energy consumption based on actual recorded data of active electrical power for lighting and total active electrical power of a cluster of eight buildings is presented. The proposed methodology uses statistical pattern recognition techniques and artificial neural ensembling networks coupled with outliers detection methods for fault detection.

In recent years. super-insulation materials with very low thermal conductivity have been developed. These materials provide satisfactory thermal insulation. but allow the total thickness of the envelope components to be kept below a certain thickness. Nevertheless. in order to penetrate the building construction market. some barriers have to be overcome. One of the main issues is that testing procedures and useful data that are able to give a reliable picture of their performance when applied to real buildings have to be provided. Vacuum Insulation Panels (VIPs) are one of the most promising high performing technologies. The overall. effective. performance of a panel under actual working conditions is influenced by thermal bridging. due to the edge of the panel envelope and to the type of joint. In this paper. a study on the critical issues related to the laboratory measurement of the equivalent thermal conductivity of VIPs and their performance degradation due to vacuum loss has been carried out utilizing guarded heat flux meter apparatus. A numerical analysis has also been developed to study thermal bridging effect when VIP panels are adopted to create multilayer boards for building applications.

These performances are due to the interior vacuum degree. which represent also the main problem connected with the applications of this technological solution in buildings constructions: to maintain the vacuum condition the panels are enclosed in an envelope layer. characterized by an higher thermal conductivity. Moreover they have to be assembled to each other or to additional different joint materials in practical building application. generating a thermal bridging effect.The aim of present work is to analyse the critical aspects related to this insulation technology for building application. An experimental campaign through heat flow meter apparatus was carried out with the purpose of assessing the decrease of performance due to the thermal bridges effects considering different joint materials in VIPs assemblies.© 2014 The Authors.

Because of this property the experimental measurement methods and criteria for VIPs may be affected by an higher measurement uncertainty and a reduced trustworthiness. This is due to the low thermal flux through the sample material during experimental assessing. The aim of this research is to verify the reliability and the accuracy of existing testing and measuring methods when are applied to VIPs. showing their drawback and limits. and proposing possible correcting criteria and guidelines.,True,k4o7118AAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610215024182,9447883623722731819,/scholar?cites=9447883623722731819,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610215024182/pdf?md5=cf2efa70d8adea67d38fce593bc77abc&pid=1-s2.0-S1876610215024182-main.pdf,0,0,0

Robust methodologies aimed to quantify the potential reduction of energy consumption for large building stocks need to be developed. To this purpose. a benchmarking analysis is necessary in order to support public planners in determining how well a building is performing. in setting credible targets for improving performance or in detecting abnormal energy consumption. In the present work. a novel methodology is proposed to perform a benchmarking analysis particularly suitable for heterogeneous samples of buildings.

However. in order to obtain a correct implementation of VIPs in buildings. it is crucial to conduct a proper analysis of the thermal bridging. the service life and the ageing effects at both the design stage and during building operation. A further factor that should be considered is the dependency of thermal conductivity on temperature.In this paper. an experimental campaign has been carried out to evaluate the variation in the thermal conductivity of VIPs with the average temperature and to qualitatively assess the heat transfer contributions that affect this variation. The study has also been devoted to evaluating the effect of a variation in the thermal conductivity considering various VIP ageing stages.

Different temperature dependences for PV performance have been reported and it has been found that the efficiency of crystalline silicon cells drops at a rate of around 0.45%/°C. Various cooling methods have been proposed to achieve lower PV cell temperature in favour of higher cell efficiencies. Passive cooling by heat spreader or heat sink can provide enough cooling to get a relatively low cell temperature even for Concentrator PV (CPV). but the heat sink surface area can be extremely large.

PCMEs could be potential candidates as heat transfer media in heating. ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.

The approach is particularly suitable for detecting faults in heating. ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and will be described in relation to that exemplary but non-limiting embodiment. The fault detection approach is based on statistical machine learning technology. This is achieved by learning the consistent nature of normal HVAC operation. and then using the statistical relationships between groups of measurements to identify anomalous deviations from the norm and identify faults in all subsystems for which sensor information is available. regardless of the specifics of the installation.

Detecting faults properly can significantly improve energy efficiency. reduce maintenance costs. and improve human comfort. However. there often exist outliers in measured data which mislead the training process for fault detection of HVAC systems.We propose a novel intelligent outlier detection approach using online soft-margin support vector machine. which introduces the slack variables to measure the degree of misclassification of the training samples. Nonlinear penalty functions have then been used to reduce the effect of outliers on the classifier. In addition. we applied an on-line incremental SVM to cope with large dataset in real time.

By using automated demand response (DR) signals. energy service providers aim to constrain the electrical demand that these systems place on the grid. One such DR signalling standard being developed in Australia is AS4755. 3.1 that defines how air conditioning appliances respond to a set of initiating signals for reducing energy consumption.

Key findings show that given oversized AC systems for the space they service. the current version of the AS4755 standard may not achieve the magnitude of DR implied by the DR signal definitions.

MPC is becoming more and more viable because of the increase in computational power of building automation systems and the availability of a significant amount of monitored building data. MPC has found successful implementation in building thermal regulation. fully exploiting the potential of building thermal mass. Moreover. MPC has been positively applied to active energy storage systems. as well as to the optimal management of on-site renewable energy sources. MPC also opens up several opportunities for enhancing energy efficiency in the operation of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems because of its ability to consider constraints. prediction of disturbances and multiple conflicting objectives. such as indoor thermal comfort and building energy demand. Despite the application of MPC algorithms in building control has been thoroughly investigated in various works. a unified framework that fully describes and formulates the implementation is still lacking. Firstly. this work introduces a common dictionary and taxonomy that gives a common ground to all the engineering disciplines involved in building design and control. Secondly the main scope of this paper is to define the MPC formulation framework and critically discuss the outcomes of different existing MPC algorithms for building and HVAC system management.

While the powertrain is modeled as the deterministic component of the dynamics. the driver behavior is represented as a stochastic system which affects the vehicle dynamics. Since stochastic MPC is based on online numerical optimization. the driver model can be learned online. hence allowing the control algorithm to adapt to different drivers and drivers' behaviors. The proposed technique is evaluated in two applications: adaptive cruise control. where the driver behavioral model is used to predict the leading vehicle dynamics. and series hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV) energy management. where the driver model is used to predict the future power requests.,True,TPqjMKsAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC,108,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5717791/,17011218752225385525,/scholar?cites=17011218752225385525,,http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/publications/papers/cdc10-stoch-auto.pdf,0,0,0

1169741,Model predictive control based on linear programming~ the explicit solution,2002,Alberto Bemporad and Francesco Borrelli and Manfred Morari,47,IEEE transactions on automatic control,12,1974-1985,,For discrete-time linear time-invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states. we describe a method to determine explicitly. as a function of the initial state. the solution to optimal control problems that can be formulated using a linear program (LP). In particular. we focus our attention on performance criteria based on a mixed 1/∞-norm. namely 1-norm with respect to time and∞-norm with respect to space. We show that the optimal control profile is a piecewise affine and continuous function of the initial state. Thus. when optimal control profiles are computed at each time step as in model predictive control (MPC) schemes. the explicit piecewise affine form allows to eliminate on-line LP. as the computation associated with MPC becomes a simple function evaluation. Therefore the proposed technique is attractive for a wide range of applications where simple on-line computation is a crucial requirement. Besides practical advantages. the availability of the explicit structure of the MPC controller provides an insight into the type of control action in different regions of the state space. and highlights possible conditions of degeneracies of the LP. such as multiple optima.,True,XC3nc68AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,828,https://www.academia.edu/download/31077934/AUTT.pdf,15320794988462783561,/scholar?cites=15320794988462783561,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31077934/AUTT.pdf,0,0,0
1169742,Predictive control for linear and hybrid systems,2017,Francesco Borrelli and Alberto Bemporad and Manfred Morari,,,,,Cambridge University Press,Model Predictive Control (MPC). the dominant advanced control approach in industry over the past twenty-five years. is presented comprehensively in this unique book. With a simple. unified approach. and with attention to real-time implementation. it covers predictive control theory including the stability. feasibility. and robustness of MPC controllers. The theory of explicit MPC. where the nonlinear optimal feedback controller can be calculated efficiently. is presented in the context of linear systems with linear constraints. switched linear systems. and. more generally. linear hybrid systems. Drawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous examples and illustrative applications. the authors discuss the techniques required to design predictive control laws. including algorithms for polyhedral manipulations. mathematical and multiparametric programming and how to validate the theoretical properties and to implement predictive control policies. The most important algorithms feature in an accompanying free online MATLAB toolbox. which allows easy access to sample solutions.

Heidelberg,Explicit model predictive control (MPC) addresses the problem of removing one of the main drawbacks of MPC. namely the need to solve a mathematical program on line to compute the control action. This computation prevents the application of MPC in several contexts. either because the computer technology needed to solve the optimization problem within the sampling time is too expensive or simply infeasible. or because the computer code implementing the numerical solver causes software certification concerns.especially in safety critical applications.Explicit MPC allows one to solve the optimization problem off-line for a given range of operating conditions of interest.

These foams were tested as electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 8 M KOH solutions. Polarisation curves were obtained for the Ni–Cu foams and for a solid Ni electrode. in the 25–85 °C temperature range. and the main kinetic parameters were determined. It was observed that the 3D foams have higher catalytic activity than pure Ni. HER activation energies for the Ni–Cu foams were lower (34–36 kJ mol−1) than those calculated for the Ni electrode (62 kJ mol−1).

His findings changed the treatment of diffusion data and the theory of diffusion itself. A diffusion-based framework was successfully employed to explain the behaviour of the Kirkendall plane. Nonetheless. the complexity of a multiphase diffusion zone and the morphological evolution during interdiffusion requires a physico-chemical approach.

Prior to electrodeposition. the carbon nanofoam substrate is subjected to a functionalization process. which leads to an increase of about 40% in its specific capacitance value. Formation of cobalt hydroxide clusters onto the functionalized carbon nanofoam by pulse electrodeposition further enhances the specific capacitance of the electrode. The combination of these factors with an enlarged working potential window. results in a material with specific capacitance close to 300 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1. considering the total mass loading of the composite.

Cardoso and Maria-José U Ferreira,25,Molecules,,3364,MDPI,Multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer is one of the main limitations for chemotherapy success. Numerous mechanisms are behind the MDR phenomenon wherein the overexpression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins P-glycoprotein (P-gp). breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is highlighted as a prime factor. Natural product-derived compounds are being addressed as promising ABC transporter modulators to tackle MDR. Flavonoids and terpenoids have been extensively explored in this field as mono or dual modulators of these efflux pumps. Nitrogen-bearing moieties on these scaffolds were proved to influence the modulation of ABC transporters efflux function. This review highlights the potential of semisynthetic nitrogen-containing flavonoid and terpenoid derivatives as candidates for the design of effective MDR reversers.

1169999,Preparation and Preclinical Evaluation of New Triterpenoid Compounds,2016,Bruno Miguel Ferreira Gonçalves,,,,,,Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. with an estimated 8.2 million cancer-related deaths registered in 2012. Moreover. the number of new cancer cases diagnosed each year is expected to rise significantly over the next decades. Considering that antineoplastic agents available currently in the clinic have several limitations and some serious side effects. it’s urgent the development of new chemotherapeutic agents with increased efficacy.  Natural products have been an important source of leads for the development of new drugs. including new anticancer drugs. In fact. some of the most important antineoplastic agents used in the clinic are derived from natural products. Pentacyclic triterpenoids represent a large and structurally diverse class of natural products that display diverse biological activities. including anticancer activity. Because of this activity. their relatively safe profile. and readily availability in nature. pentacyclic triterpenoids are interesting compounds for the design of new leads aimed at the development of new anticancer agents. Asiatic acid is an ursane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid whose anticancer properties have been extensively studied over the last few years. This compound exhibited promising anticancer effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover. previous studies reported that structural modification of asiatic acid backbone may improve its anticancer activity. Therefore. the aim of this project was to synthesize new semisynthetic derivatives of asiatic acid in order to improve its anticancer activity and obtain compounds that may be valuable for the development of new anticancer treatments.

Their activity is a crucial factor leading to therapeutic failure. It is likely that compounds which inhibit the function of the MDR-efflux proteins such as MDR1 will improve the cytotoxic action of anticancer chemotherapy. Therefore. a search for MDR reversing compounds was conducted among three classes of plant derived compounds such as diterpenes. triterpenes and carotenoids in a hope to find inhibitors without adverse effects in these natural compounds.

As a liquid-vapor phase-change process. capillary evaporation heat transfer on wicking structures has received increased interest owing to its potential to dissipate high heat flux by increasing effective heat transfer area and sustaining the liquid supply. However. the approaches based on capillary evaporation suffer from intrinsic tradeoffs between low thermal resistance for heat flow and high wicking flow rate for liquid supply. which makes it challenging to optimize both heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF) on the same wicking structure.

In this work. a new roof-integrated radiative air-cooling system is introduced. which couples radiative sky cooling with attic ventilation to reduce attic temperature. A radiative air cooler with 1.08 m2 surface area is constructed using a recently developed daytime radiative sky cooling metamaterial [Zhai et al.. Science 355. pp. 1062–1066. 2017].

The PCM has been integrated at the hot side of the thermoelectric cooler to maintain constant and relatively low temperature. The study has been carried out with variable geometric parameters of the heat sink. variable cooling load conditions. variable input currents to the TEC and with different PCMs. The results show that there is a significant reduction in both hot and cold side temperatures of the thermoelectric cooler with the use of PCM.

However. radiative cooling has relatively low energy intensity. about 100 W/m2 cooling power on daily average. To work with power plants generally at few hundreds of megawatts. an intermediate system is needed to bridge this huge energy intensity mismatching at low energy cost. A low-pump-power demand pipe network is proposed to collect cold energy generated by the radiative cooling surfaces using water as the heat transfer fluid and the cold water is thus stored in intermediate storage devices.

Equally as significant. our detailed characterization elucidates the previously convoluted mechanisms of the solid-electrolyte interphase on Si electrodes. We provide a theoretical simulation to model the interface and microstructural-compositional analyses that confirm our theoretical predictions and allow us to visualize the precise location and constitution of various interfacial components.

When integrated in a single engine configuration. these advanced hardware components may result in significant nonlinearities and interactions thereby requiring advanced control methods. In this paper we consider one such situation when demands for increased engine power. improved fuel economy and drivability provide a rationale for utilizing a variable geometry turbocharger while emission regulations necessitate an external exhaust gas recirculation system. However. careful modelling and analysis of the integrated system (Figure 1) uncovers difficult issues that a control designer must face in order to realize the benefits of advanced hardware components. An automotive turbocharger consists of a compressor and a turbine coupled by a common shaft. The engine exhaust gas drives the turbine which drives the compressor which. in turn. compresses ambient air and directs it into intake manifold 5]. Since the increased quantity of air can be delivered to engine cylinders. a larger quantity of fuel can be burnt thereby providing larger torque output as compared to non-turbocharged engines. The turbocharging also improves fuel economy due to improved efficiency of engine operation at lean air-to-fuel ratios.Turbocharging also affects regulated engine emissions such as particulates (PM). oxides of nitrogen (NOx). hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO).

Optimization of the purge interval and cycle duration. for a given operating power. can increase the fuel cell efficiency which depends on three interrelated objectives. namely. the hydrogen loss during the purge. the average voltage output between the purges. and the voltage decrease due to the carbon corrosion caused by hydrogen starvation over the lifetime of the DEA operation.In advancing past results. this paper shows how the purge cycle can be optimized for better efficiency in DEA operation by considering the impact of carbon corrosion.

Since only the surface temperature of the battery can be measured. a thermal model is needed to estimate the core temperature. which can be higher and hence more critical. In this paper. an on-line parameter identification scheme is designed for a cylindrical lithium ion battery thermal model. by which the parameters of the thermal model can be identified automatically. An adaptive observer is designed based on the on-line parameterization methodology and the closed loop architecture.

Control of surface chemistry allows the interfacial resistance to be reduced to 2 Ω cm2. lower than that of liquid electrolytes. without the need for interlayer coatings. A mechanistic understanding of the origins of ultra-low resistance is provided by quantitatively evaluating the linkages between interfacial chemistry. Li wettability. and electrochemical phenomena. A combination of Li contact angle measurements. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). first-principles calculations. and impedance spectroscopy demonstrates that the presence of common LLZO surface contaminants.

However. a complete mechanistic understanding of electrode overpotential variations that occur during extended cycling of Li metal is lacking. Herein. we demonstrate that when using a Li metal electrode. the dynamic changes in voltage during extended cycles can be increasingly attributed to mass transport. It is shown that these mass transport effects arise as a result of dead Li accumulation at the Li metal electrode. which introduces a tortuous pathway for Li-ion transport. In Li–Li symmetric cells. mass transport effects cause the shape of the galvanostatic voltage response to change from “peaking” to “arcing”. along with an increase in total electrode overpotential.

Models for gaseous radiative properties have been well-established for air combustion. However. there is uncertainty regarding their applicability to oxy−fuel conditions. In this paper. a new and complete set of weighted sum of gray gases model (WSGGM) is derived. which is applicable to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of both air−fuel and oxy−fuel combustion.

At first they have proven to have excellent resistance to high CO concentrations. which decreases the number of system components in the fuel processing system. The preferential oxidation reactors can be left out and in addition a water condenser is not required. These system simplifications additionally decrease the parasitic losses associated with the components.However. insufficient data are currently published to enable good system design and modeling.

Cylinders and disks represent a much better geometrical approximation to the shape of bio-fuels such as straws and woods chips. A sphere gives an extreme in terms of the volume-to-surface-area ratio. which impacts both motion and reaction of a particle. For a nonspherical particle. an additional lift force becomes important. and generally hydrodynamic forces introduce a torque on the particle as the centre of pressure does not coincide with the centre of mass. Therefore. rotation of a nonspherical particle needs to be considered.

A charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is used to record the whole combustion process. For the particles with similar volume (mass). cylindrical particles are found to lose mass faster than spherical particles and the burnout time is shortened by increasing the particle aspect ratio (surface area). The conversion times of cylindrical particles with almost the same surface area/volume ratio are very close to each other.

A unit cell assembly with a BASF Celtec®-P2100 high temperature membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of 45 cm 2 active surface area is investigated by means of impedance spectroscopy. The concentrations in the anode feed gas of all impurities. unconverted methanol-water vapor mixture. CO and CO 2 were varied along with current density according to a multilevel factorial design of experiments. Results show that all the impurities degrade the performance. with CO being the most degrading agent and CO 2 the least. The factorial analysis shows that there is interdependence among the effects of the different factors considered. This interdependence suggests. for example. that tolerances to concentrations of CO above 2% may be compromised by the presence in the anode feed of CO 2. Methanol has a poisoning effect on the fuel cell at all the tested feed ratios. and the performance drop is found to be proportional to the amount of methanol in feed gas. The effects are more pronounced when other impurities are also present in the feed gas. especially at higher methanol concentrations.

It explores the renewable ways of obtaining methanol and its use in efficient energy systems for a net zero-emission carbon cycle. with a special focus on fuel cells. It investigates the different parts of the carbon cycle from a methanol and fuel cell perspective. In recent years. the potential for a methanol economy has been shown and there has been significant technological advancement of its renewable production and utilization. Even though its full adoption will require further development. it can be produced from renewable electricity and biomass or CO2 capture and can be used in several industrial sectors. which make it an excellent liquid electrofuel for the transition to a sustainable economy. By converting CO2 into liquid fuels. the harmful effects of CO2 emissions from existing industries that still rely on fossil fuels are reduced. The methanol can then be used both in the energy sector and the chemical industry. and become an all-around substitute for petroleum.

The tested faults were reactant starvation (both fuel and oxidant). flooding. drying. CO poisoning. and H 2 S poisoning. Galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were recorded between 2 kHz and 0.1 Hz on a commercial stack of 46 cells of a 100-cm 2 active area each. The results. obtained through distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis of the EIS data. show that characteristic peaks of the DRT and their changes with the different fault intensity levels can be used to extract the features of the tested faults. It was shown that flooding and drying present features on the opposite ends of the frequency spectrum due the effect of drying on the membrane conductivity and the blocking effect of flooding that constricts the reactants’ flow. Moreover. it was seen that while the effect of CO poisoning is limited to high frequency processes. above 100 Hz. the effects of H 2 S extend to below 10 Hz. Finally. the performance degradation due to all the tested faults. including H 2 S poisoning. is recoverable to a great extent. implying that condition correction after fault detection can contribute to prolonged lifetime of the fuel cell.

The model utilizes the same modelling approach used in previous work where the electrolyzer cell is divided in four subsections: cathode. anode. membrane and voltage. The model of the electrodes includes key electrochemical reactions and gas transport mechanism (ie. H 2. O 2 and H 2 O) whereas the model of the membrane includes physical mechanisms such as water diffusion. electro osmotic drag and hydraulic pressure. Voltage was modelled including main overpotentials (ie. activation. ohmic. concentration). First and second law efficiencies were defined. Key empirical parameters depending on temperature were identified in the activation and ohmic overpotentials. The electrodes reference exchange current densities and change transfer coefficients were related to activation overpotentials whereas hydrogen ion diffusion to Ohmic overvoltages. These model parameters were empirically fitted so that polarization curve obtained by the model predicted well the voltage at different current found by the experimental results. Finally. from the efficiency calculation. it was shown that at low current densities the electrolyzer cell absorbs heat from the surroundings.

In this paper a comprehensive pseudo-homogenous model of a multi-tubular packed-bed reformer has been developed to investigate the impact of operating conditions and geometric parameters on its performance. A kinetic Langmuir-Hinshelwood model of the methanol steam reforming process was proposed based on the work of Peppley et al.[1]. In addition to the kinetic model. the pressure drop and the mass and heat transfer phenomena along the reactor were taken into account. This model was verified by a dynamic model in the platform of ASPEN. The diffusion effect inside catalyst particles was also estimated and accounted for by the effectiveness factor. The simulation results showed axial temperature profiles in both tube and shell side with different operating conditions. Moreover. the lower flow rate of liquid fuel and higher inlet temperature of thermal air led to a lower concentration of residual methanol. but also a higher concentration of generated CO from the reformer exit. The choices of operating conditions were limited to ensure a tolerable concentration of methanol and CO in H 2-rich gas for feeding into a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) stack. With fixed catalyst load. the increase of tube number and decrease of tube diameter improved the methanol conversion. but also increased the CO concentration in reformed gas.

Cylinders and disks represent a much better geometrical approximation to the shape of bio-fuels such as straws and woods chips. A sphere gives an extreme in terms of the volume-to-surface-area ratio. which impacts both motion and reaction of a particle. For a nonspherical particle. an additional lift force becomes important. and generally hydrodynamic forces introduce a torque on the particle as the centre of pressure does not coincide with the centre of mass. Therefore. rotation of a nonspherical particle needs to be considered. This paper derives a model for tracking nonspherical particles in a nonuniform flow field. which is validated by a preliminary experimental study: the calculated results agree well with measurements in both translation and rotation aspects.

Current energy storage methods are highly dependent on lithium-ion energy storage devices. and the expanded use of these technologies is likely to affect existing lithium reserves. The abundance of sodium makes Na-ion-based devices very attractive as an alternative. sustainable energy storage system.

The main aim of the paper is to develop an experimental setup and to utilize mathematical-physical models of heat transfer for studying the heat transfer and penetration into model food particles. The laboratory setup was constructed as follows: A cast iron pot was cut in half along the vertical symmetry plane and a glass plate was glued onto the open half with a temperature-tolerant adhesive. This formed a window that allowed visual inspection of the boiling processes and physical changes in the food. The idea is inspired by Myhrwold et al.(2011). The vessel was heated by placing it on a contact frying rig where the contact temperature can be controlled. and the temperature of the fluid and evaporative mass loss is measured continuously (Ashokkumar and Adler-Nissen. 2011).As model food particle a potato cut in half was tightly attached to the glass plate and submerged in the liquid. The process was filmed with a video camera. and a moving gelatinisation front was observed in the potato. To confirm that this phenomenon was gelatinisation. cut surfaces were coloured with iodine. and the coloured front resembled the front seen by the video inspection. Furthermore. T-type thermocouples were attached inside the half potato to investigate the actual gelatinisation temperature. This enabled the construction of a heating curve inside the potato serving as a validation tool for modelling work. To investigate the effect of different heat transfer conditions for the potato. experiments were conducted with water and a tomato soup as the liquid medium.

Turbulent combustion is modeled by the tabulated thermo-chemistry approach in combination with the presumed probability density function (PDF). A b-function is used to model the distribution of the mixture fraction. while two different PDFs. d-function (Model I) and b-function (Model II). are applied to model the reaction progress. Temperature is obtained by solving filtered energy transport equation and the reaction rate of the progress variable is rescaled by pressure to consider the effects of compressibility. The adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique is used to properly capture shock waves. boundary layers. shear layers and flame structures. Statistical results of temperature and velocity predicted by Model II show better accuracy than that predicted by Model I. The results of scatter points and mixture fraction-conditional variables indicate the significant differences between Model I and Model II. It is concluded that second moment information in the presumed PDF of the reaction progress is very important in the simulation of supersonic combustion. It is also found that an unstable flame with extinction and ignition develops in the shear layers of bluff body and a fuelrich partially premixed flame stabilizes in the central recirculation bubble.© 2015 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA & BUAA.

1170450,Large-eddy Simulations of Transverse Jet Combustion in Supersonic Cross-flow: Flame Stability and Mixing Mechanism,,Majie Zhao and Taohong Ye and Qinling Li,,,,,,Transverse jet in supersonic cross-flow (JISCF) is one of the most fundamental flow phenomena in supersonic combustion chambers [1–5]. such as the actual flight vehicle Hyshot II [6. 7] and the supersonic combustion experiments by Gamba et al.[8. 9]. In JISCF combustion chambers. there exist complex shock train. flame. turbulence and boundary layer interactions [6–15]. In addition to auto-ignition due to high-enthalpy and shock aerodynamic heating. local extinction caused by turbulent small-scale vortex and re-ignition. there is also strong coupling between the density. pressure. temperature and velocity. The change in density is not only due to the exothermic heat release of the combustion chemical reaction. but also the viscous compression of the supersonic flows. Therefore. the JISCF combustion is a great challenge. and fundamental understanding about the mixing. combustion and flame stabilization at supersonic regime is still limited [16. 17].The main shock waves and flow structures of a sonic jet in supersonic crossflow [10] are illustrated in Figure 1. The bow shock wave and the recirculation zone upstream of the jet orifice contribute to auto-ignition and flame anchoring for higher jet to cross-flow flux ratio [10. 18]. which is defined as 𝐽= ρjUj 2 ρ∞ U∞ 2⁄. The distributed reaction zone along the horseshoe vortex region is also observed for the higher jet to crossflow flux ratios [10].

Based on a resistance–capacitance circuit model of the battery and data obtained from abundant experiments. it was observed that the diffusion capacitance shows great correlation with SOH of a lithium-ion battery. However. accurate measurement of this diffusion capacitance in real time in an electric or hybrid electric vehicle is not practical. In this paper. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to estimate the battery model parameters including the diffusion capacitance in real time using measurement of current and voltage of the battery. The battery SOH can then be determined using the identified diffusion capacitance. Temperature influence is also considered to improve the robustness and precision of SOH estimation results.

The results showed that for a homogeneous system. a small amount of DME addition to methane resulted in a significant reduction in the high temperature ignition delay. The ignition enhancement effect by DME addition was found to exceed that possible with equivalent amounts of hydrogen addition. and it was investigated by using radical pool growth and computational singular perturbation analysis. For a non-premixed methane–air system. it was found that two different ignition enhancement regimes exist: a kinetic limited regime and a transport limited regime.

The emphasis is placed on investigating the critical flame radius controlling spherical flame initiation and its correlation with the minimum ignition energy. It is found that the critical flame radius is different from the flame thickness and the flame ball radius and that their relationship depends strongly on the Lewis number. Three different flame regimes in terms of the Lewis number are observed and a new criterion for the critical flame radius is introduced. For mixtures with Lewis number larger than a critical Lewis number above unity. the critical flame radius is smaller than the flame ball radius but larger than the flame thickness.

1170482,The role of particle collisions in pneumatic transport.,1991,MY Louge and E Mastorakos and JT Jenkins,231,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,8,345,,We analyse the dilute. steady. fully developed flow of relatively massive particles in a turbulent gas in the context of a vertical pipe. The idea is that the exchange of momentum in collisions between the grains and between the grains and the wall plays a significant role in the balance of forces in the particle phase. Consequently. the particle phase is considered to be a dilute system of colliding grains. in which the velocity fluctuations are produced by collisions rather than by the gas turbulence. The balance equations for rapid granular flow are modified to incorporate the drag force from the gas. and boundary conditions. based on collisional exchanges of momentum and energy at the wall. are employed. The turbulence of the gas is treated using a one-equation closure.

Its study is extremely timely in view of the need to develop new combustion technologies in order to address challenges associated with climate change. energy source uncertainty. and air pollution. Despite the fact that modeling of turbulent combustion is a subject that has been researched for a number of years. its complexity implies that key issues are still eluding. and a theoretical description that is accurate enough to make turbulent combustion models rigorous and quantitative for industrial use is still lacking. In this book. prominent experts review most of the available approaches in modeling turbulent combustion. with particular focus on the exploding increase in computational resources that has allowed the simulation of increasingly detailed phenomena. The relevant algorithms are presented. the theoretical methods are explained. and various application examples are given. The book is intended for a relatively broad audience. including seasoned researchers and graduate students in engineering. applied mathematics and computational science. engine designers and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) practitioners. scientists at funding agencies. and anyone wishing to understand the state-of-the-art and the future directions of this scientifically challenging and practically important field.,True,q9Q17GIAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,214,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=oeKg2I95LZsC&oi=fnd&pg=PR8&dq=info:Hhto2VCbcI4J:scholar.google.com&ots=PLvUkO2RRz&sig=ZFGxlXC-Wf8C_vBVkv7PqJZwumU,10263874322324527902,/scholar?cites=10263874322324527902,,https://cds.cern.ch/record/1338779/files/978-94-007-0412-1_BookTOC.pdf,0,0,0

The spark position. energy. duration. electrode diameter and gap. and the jet velocity and air premixing of the fuel stream are examined to study their effects on the ignition probability defined as successful flame establishment. The flame is visualized by a high-speed camera and planar laser-induced fluorescence of OH. It was found that after an initially spherical shape. the flame took a cylindrical shape with a propagating edge upstream. The probability of successful ignition increases with high spark energy. thin electrode diameter and wide gap. but decreases with increasing dilution of the jet with air.

1170528,Differential quadrature and its application in engineering,2012,Chang Shu,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,In the past few years. the differential quadrature method has been applied extensively in engineering. This book. aimed primarily at practising engineers. scientists and graduate students. gives a systematic description of the mathematical fundamentals of differential quadrature and its detailed implementation in solving Helmholtz problems and problems of flow. structure and vibration. Differential quadrature provides a global approach to numerical discretization. which approximates the derivatives by a linear weighted sum of all the functional values in the whole domain. Following the analysis of function approximation and the analysis of a linear vector space. it is shown in the book that the weighting coefficients of the polynomial-based. Fourier expansion-based. and exponential-based differential quadrature methods can be computed explicitly. It is also demonstrated that the polynomial-based differential quadrature method is equivalent to the highest-order finite difference scheme. Furthermore. the relationship between differential quadrature and conventional spectral collocation is analysed.

Diffuse-interface models have been used previously primarily for density-matched fluids. and it remains unclear to what extent such models can be used for fluids of different density. thereby potentially limiting the application of these models. In this paper. the convective Cahn–Hilliard equation and the condition that the velocity field is divergence-free are derived from the conservation law of mass of binary mixtures in a straightforward way. for fluids with large density and viscosity ratios.

However. different from the conventional DQ method. the weighting coefficients in present method are determined by taking the radial basis functions (RBFs) instead of high order polynomials as the test functions. The method works in a similar fashion as conventional finite difference schemes but with “truly” mesh-free property.

In this work. the lattice Boltzmann method. a particle-based approach. is applied to simulate the two-dimensional isothermal pressure driven microchannel flow. Two boundary treatment schemes are incorporated to investigate their impacts to the entire flow field. We pay particular attention to the pressure and the slip velocity distributions along the channel in our simulation. We also look at the mass flow rate which is constant throughout the channel and the overall average velocity for the pressure-driven flow. In addition. we include a simulation of shear-driven flow in our results for verification. Our numerical results compare well with those obtained analytically and experimentally.

The flow field is investigated and the dynamical system technique (Poincaré section) is employed to analyze the fluid mixing. The results show that when liquid coolant flows through the wavy microchannels. secondary flow (Dean vortices) can be generated. It is found that the quantity and the location of the vortices may change along the flow direction. leading to chaotic advection. which can greatly enhance the convective fluid mixing. and thus the heat transfer performance of the present wavy microchannels is much better than that of straight microchannels with the same cross section.

Passive mixers usually use the channel geometry to stir the fluids. and many previously reported designs rely on inertial effects which are only available at moderate Re.

The method is a hybrid approach. which combines the conventional finite difference (FD) scheme and the mesh-free least square-based finite difference (MLSFD) method. In this method. the MLSFD method is adopted to deal with the complex geometry for its “truly” mesh-free property. and it is responsible for the spatial discretization in the region around the complex geometry which represents the stationary solid obstacle. Correspondingly. conventional FD scheme is applied in the rest of the flow domain to take advantage of its high computational efficiency.

1170567,Effects of water droplet evaporation on propagation of premixed spherical flames,,Yijie Zhuang and Huangwei Zhang,,,,,,Droplet evaporation has attracted many researchers’ attentions for decades. because of its importance in practical applications. like in fire suppression for civil infrastructures (eg buildings) and also space vehicles (eg manned spaceships)[1]. It is well known that water mist is an effective fire-suppression agent and has been developed for commercial practice.Scientifically. the comprehensive interactions between continuous gas phase and dispersed liquid phase can be interpreted in terms of inter-phasic exchanges of mass. momentum. energy and chemical species [2]. There have been numerous investigations available on water-droplet-laden combustion. and most of them are concentrated on understanding weakening (or “suppression” in fire science) of the gaseous flames caused by the dispersed water droplets. It is found that water mist is more effective than inert agents (eg nitrogen) in reducing the burning velocity [3]. Also. addition of water droplet into the air stream can decrease the extinction strain rate in counterflow configurations [4. 5]. These findings are also confirmed by the numerical simulations of freely propagating hydrogen-. methane-and propane-air flames laden with water droplets made by Kee and his co-workers [6. 7]. Greenburg and Dvorjetski investigate the effects of polydispersed water spray on extinction of counterflow polydispersed spray flame and gaseous diffusion flames [8. 9].

The PNCs were modelled using a simple modelling approach (modified Box model. including vertical variation). an Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT. All models disregarded any particle dynamics. CFD simulations have been carried out in a simplified geometry of the selected street canyon. Four different sizes of emission sources have been used in the CFD simulations to assess the effect of source size on mean PNC distributions in the street canyon.

SF is a Probability Density Function (PDF) method which allows both means and variances of the scalars to be calculated as well as considering the effect of segregation on reaction rates. It was found that the variance of reactive scalars such as NO2 was very high in the mixing region at roof-top level with rms values of the order of the mean values. The effect of segregation on major species such as O3 was found to be very small using either mechanism. however. some radical species in CBM-IV showed a significant difference.

The aerosol population is modelled using an assumed log-normal size distribution.

However. this effect was small compared to that of adjusting modelled surface tension. Only by adjusting this was it possible to reproduce correctly the downstream evolution of particle number found in experiment.

It was found that while an LES grid may sufficiently resolve velocity fields. the conditional scalar dissipation rate obtained may still be affected by grid size due to the calculation of sub-grid scalar dissipation rate. and this can affect the degree of localised extinction predicted. A study of the relative size of the terms in the CMC equation during an extinction/reignition event showed that transport. including in the cross stream direction. plays a key role.

The equivalence of the two methods. provided the stochastic integrals are correctly evaluated. is demonstrated for a one-dimensional diffusion problem and also in the simulation of a laboratory reacting plume. The Ito implementation was found to result in a more robust method numerically and was used for all subsequent calculations.

Tests with premixed flames have confirmed that the fluctuations of the mass flow rate of air can affect the heat release rate through purely aerodynamic phenomenon but little work has been done to test the sensitivity of the heat release rate to changes in the fuel atomisation process.

Previous work has shown that eddy resolving CFD methods are capable of predicting the soiling pattern on the surface of automotive geometries when a known spray source is used. Here the influence of the wheel. ground and spray boundary conditions on a simulation of rear soiling of a generic SUV are investigated. The inclusion of rotating wheels led to a greater vertical distribution of the soiling pattern whereas the moving ground plane led to increased lateral distribution. The total soiling rate with moving wheels and ground. as well as with the offset between wheel and ground removed. was approximately 50% higher than the experimental conditions.

1170593,Spray Response to Acoustic Forcing of a Multi-Passage Lean-Burn Aero-Engine Fuel Injector,2018,Jialin Su and Ashley Barker and Andrew Garmory and Jon Carrotte,,,,,American Society of Mechanical Engineers Digital Collection,An air-blast fuel injector in an aero-engine plays an important role in the thermoacoustic behaviour of the combustion system. Previous studies have looked at the response of the gas phase to acoustic forcing of fuel injectors but less attention has been paid to the liquid phase. Even if the fuel flow rate is assumed to remain constant. the atomisation process is driven by the relative velocity of the air and fuel. Hence air velocity fluctuations will lead to changes in atomisation which will significantly affect the flame. In this work. we use both experiment and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the response of the spray produced by a multi-passage lean-burn aero-engine fuel injector to acoustic forcing. A Phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) system was used to measure the spray size and velocity statistics at points downstream of a fuel injector operating under atmospheric conditions.

Within the framework of constant density. large activation energy and quasi-steady assumptions. a correlation describing spherical flame propagation speed as a function of flame radius is derived. This correlation is used to assess the influence of gas and particle properties on initiation and propagation of premixed spherical flames. Spherical flame initiation and propagation are shown to be influenced noticeably by the appearance of inert solid particles. It is found that the flame propagation speed and temperature both decrease with increased particle heat capacity and thermal relaxation time.

Though the behavior of such a bubble near an elastic (relatively thick) boundary has been studied by several authors. much less attention is focused on the behavior of such a bubble near a (thin) elastic membrane.

The IB–LBFS applies the fractional-step method to split the overall solution process into the predictor step and the corrector step. In the predictor step. the intermediate flow field is predicted by applying the LBFS (lattice Boltzmann flux solver) without considering the presence of immersed object. The LBFS applies the finite volume method to solve N–S (Navier–Stokes) equations for the flow variables at cell centers. At each cell interface. the LBFS evaluates its viscous and inviscid fluxes simultaneously through local reconstruction of the LBE (lattice Boltzmann equation) solutions.

Two different types of wall shear stress gauges were tested: a flush-mounted hot wire in contact with the wall substrate and commercially available quartz substrate hot-film gauges with different thicknesses of quartz coating. It is found that the flush-mounted hot-wire gauge has a much higher dynamic response than the quartz substrate gauges. although it is still lower than the marginally elevated hot-wire configuration.

Both larger values of and smaller values of h improve the dynamic response of a near-wall hot wire.

We compare the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different natural gas pathways for medium and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs). For Class 8 tractor-trailers and refuse trucks. none of the natural gas pathways provide emissions reductions per unit of freight-distance moved compared to diesel trucks. When compared to the petroleum-based fuels currently used in these vehicles. CNG and centrally produced LNG increase emissions by 0–3% and 2–13%. respectively. for Class 8 trucks. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) powered with natural gas-produced electricity are the only fuel-technology combination that achieves emission reductions for Class 8 transit buses (31% reduction compared to the petroleum-fueled vehicles).

Small modular reactors (SMRs). which could become part of a portfolio of carbon-free energy sources. are one such technology. Existing estimates of likely SMR costs rely on problematic top-down approaches or bottom-up assessments that are proprietary. When done properly. expert elicitations can complement these approaches. We developed detailed technical descriptions of two SMR designs and then conduced elicitation interviews in which we obtained probabilistic judgments from 16 experts who are involved in. or have access to. engineering-economic assessments of SMR projects.

Adoption could be encouraged by making cogeneration more economically attractive. either by increasing the expected returns or decreasing the risks of such investments. We evaluate the expected returns from demand response. capacity markets. regulation markets. accelerated depreciation. pricing CO2 emissions. and net metering. We find that (1) there is an incentive to overcommit in the capacity market due to lenient non-response penalties. (2) there is significant revenue potential in the regulation market. though demand-side resources are yet to participate. (3) a price on CO2 emissions will make cogeneration more attractive relative to conventional. utility-supplied energy. and (4) accelerated depreciation is an easy and effective mechanism for improving the economics of cogeneration.

Proper selection of weight values is crucial when the top-level targets are unattainable. for example when “stretch” targets are used. In this case. strict design consistency cannot be achieved with finite weights; however. it is possible to achieve arbitrarily small inconsistencies.

1170829,Diagonal quadratic approximation for parallelization of analytical target cascading,2008,Yanjing Li and Zhaosong Lu and Jeremy J Michalek,130,Journal of Mechanical Design,5,,American Society of Mechanical Engineers Digital Collection,When designing complex systems. generally it is not possible or desirable to have a single decision maker in charge of all decisions because of the need to manage problem complexity. Instead. such systems are routinely decomposed hierarchically into subsystems and components. and various design groups interact to coordinate their decisions and achieve a feasible and consistent system solution. For each system in such a hierarchy. target specifications are chosen for the subsystems below such that the system can meet targets set by the supersystem above. If targets cannot be met. then negotiation and rebalancing is necessary to ensure that the final system solution is consistent and achieves system goals. Ford Motor Company refers to this process as target cascading. and the analogous model-based. computational process for such hierarchical systems has been termed analytical target cascading ATC 1 …,True,92jyX2EAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,94,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanicaldesign/article-abstract/130/5/051402/458354,10007789328896983326,/scholar?cites=10007789328896983326,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.723.2503&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1170830,Should designers worry about market systems?,2009,Ching-Shin Norman Shiau and Jeremy J Michalek,131,Journal of Mechanical Design,1,,American Society of Mechanical Engineers Digital Collection,We examine how profit-maximizing designs are influenced by two structural aspects of market systems:(1) the structure of manufacturer-retailer interactions and (2) the structure of heterogeneity in consumer preference modeling. We first model firms as players in a profit-seeking game that compete on product attributes and prices offered. We then model the interactions of manufacturers and retailers in Nash competition under alternative channel structures and compare the equilibrium conditions for each case. We find that under linear logit consumer choice. optimal design can be decoupled from the game. and design decisions can be made without regard to price. competition. or channel structure.

Here. we examine whether this finding may be explained by the decision-making styles of self-reported maximizers. Expanding on Schwartz et al.(2002). we find that self-reported maximizers are more likely to show problematic decision-making styles. as evidenced by self-reports of less behavioral coping. greater dependence on others when making decisions. more avoidance of decision making. and greater tendency to experience regret. Contrary to predictions. self-reported maximizers were more likely to report spontaneous decision making.

Ltd.,Several recent surveys have asked respondents to estimate the probabilities of relatively unlikely events. such as dying from breast cancer and smoking. Examination of their response distributions reveals a seemingly inappropriate ‘blip’ at 50. The two studies reported here indicate that it reflects a response artifact associated with open‐ended probability scales. The blip vanishes when a response scale with explicit response options is offered. Apparently. the open‐ended format leads some people to use the 50% option as ‘fifty–fifty’. an expression of having no idea as to the answer. As a result. the accuracy of people's reported beliefs depends on the response scale used. as well as on how it evokes and channels such feelings of epistemic uncertainty.

Inc.,Studies using open‐ended response modes to elicit probabilistic beliefs have sometimes found an elevated frequency (or blip) at 50 in their response distributions. Our previous research(1–3) suggests that this is caused by intrusion of the phrase “fifty‐fifty.” which represents epistemic uncertainty. rather than a true numeric probability of 50%. Such inappropriate responses pose a problem for decision analysts and others relying on probabilistic judgments.

However. the expansion of natural gas risks a delay in the introduction of near-zero emission energy systems. possibly offsetting the potential climate benefits of a gas-for-coal substitution. We use a schematic climate model to estimate CO2 and CH4 emissions from integrated energy systems and the resulting changes in global warming over various timeframes. Then we evaluate conditions under which delayed deployment of near-zero emission systems would result in loss of all net climate benefit (if any) from using natural gas as a bridge.

The comparisons reveal systematic differences between the raw (unadjusted) urban and rural temperature trends throughout the USHCN period of record according to all four urban classifications. According to these classifications. urbanization accounts for 14–21% of the rise in unadjusted minimum temperatures since 1895 and 6–9% since 1960.

This island arc chain comprises a total of 15 islands and is politically separated into two groups; the US Territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). The 14 islands that comprise the CNMI extend approximately 400 nm from Rota (140 Latitude) northward to Uracas (200 Latitude). These islands are geologically divided into two distinct types; the older arc islands are characterized as raised limestone islands while the more recent and younger arc islands are still volcanically active. The older islands. Rota. Aguijan. Tinian. Saipan. and Farallon de Medinilla have fringing and/or barrier reef systems. In contrast. the volcanically active arc islands have relatively little coral reef development. All islands north of Esmeralda Bank (ie. Anatahan. Sarigan. Guguan. Alamagan. Pagan. Agrihan. Asuncion.

1170912,India’s Shark Trade: An Analysis of Indian Shark Landings Based on Shark Fin Exports,2004,Zeke Hausfather,3,Maritime Studies,1,,,The growth of the international market for shark fins has coincided with an expansion of shark fishing in India. raising concerns that some shark stocks are over-exploited. India exports almost all shark fins it produces in what is largely an informal and unregulated sector. and most observers believe that official export data greatly understate actual shark fin exports. Two estimates of Indian shark fin exports. one based on projected shark fin production from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (fao) recorded landings data and the other based on recorded Hong Kong imports from India. show that actual exports are likely many times greater than officially recorded amounts. A comparative analysis of Hong Kong and fao data indicates that fao landings data may be much lower than actual shark landings. Recent events--the short-lived 2001 blanket ban on shark fishing and trade by the Government of India in particular--are analysed in terms of their effect on shark fin trade and production. The implications of a trade-based estimate of total shark landings on current shark fishing practices in India are examined. and suggestions are given regarding effective and equitable methods to protect shark stocks and fishers livelihoods.,True,Chq-VAIAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,12,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.555.7514,13892822870044665227,/scholar?cites=13892822870044665227,,,0,0,0

The objective of this article is to examine two sets of draft proposals prepared by Leopold for the purpose of rethinking economics along conservation and ecological principles. The first is a set of four draft prospectuses written during the 1930s to pursue research on “conservation economics.” The focus here was on developing economic tools to promote conservation.

The continuing influence of ASCA after 70 years can be attributed to Leopold’s extensive and deep experience in conservation. his affection for the land and ability to communicate it. and the title’s rise to prominence during the environmental movement in the USA in the 1960s and 1970s. These reasons are necessary but insufficient. To advance our understanding. we need to ask: Why do environmental practitioners and scholars continue to turn to ASCA 70 years later?

Approximately one billion people have inadequate protein intake. The challenge of preventing hunger and malnutrition will become even greater as the global population grows from the current 7.2 billion people to 9.6 billion by 2050. With increases in income. population. and demand for more nutrient-dense foods. global meat production is projected to increase by 206 million tons per year during the next 35 years. These changes in population and dietary practices have led to a tremendous rise in the demand for food protein. especially animal-source protein. Consuming the required amounts of protein is fundamental to human growth and health. Protein needs can be met through intakes of animal and plant-source foods. Increased consumption of food proteins is associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions and overutilization of water. Consequently. concerns exist regarding impacts of agricultural production. processing and distribution of food protein on the environment. ecosystem. and sustainability. To address these challenging issues. the New York Academy of Sciences organized the conference “Frontiers in Agricultural Sustainability: Studying the Protein Supply Chain to Improve Dietary Quality” to explore sustainable innovations in food science and programming aimed at producing the required quality and quantity of protein through improved supply chains worldwide.

1170935,Seven food system metrics of sustainable nutrition security,2016,David Gustafson and Alona Gutman and Whitney Leet and Adam Drewnowski and Jessica Fanzo and John Ingram,8,Sustainability,3,196,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Sustainability considerations have been absent from most food security assessments conducted to date. despite the tremendous economic. environmental. and social implications of meeting accelerating food demand in the face of water shortages and climate change. In addition. previous food security work has generally focused only on achieving adequate calories. rather than addressing dietary diversity and micronutrient adequacy. both of which are critical to maintaining a healthy overall nutritional status. In response to the limitations of previous assessments. a new methodology is proposed here based on the concept of “sustainable nutrition security”(SNS). This novel assessment methodology is intended to remedy both kinds of deficiencies in the previous work by defining seven metrics. each based on a combination of multiple indicators. for use in characterizing sustainable nutrition outcomes of food systems:(1) food nutrient adequacy;(2) ecosystem stability;(3) food affordability and availability;(4) sociocultural wellbeing;(5) food safety;(6) resilience; and (7) waste and loss reduction. Each of the metrics comprises multiple indicators that are combined to derive an overall score (0–100). A novel SNS assessment methodology based on these metrics can be deployed by decision-makers and investors to set meaningful goals. track progress. and evaluate the potential impact of food system interventions intended to improve sustainability and human nutrition outcomes.

As new investments and attention galvanize action on African agriculture to reduce hunger. there is an urgent need for metrics that monitor agricultural progress beyond calories produced per capita and address nutritional diversity essential for human health. In this study we demonstrate how an ecological tool. functional diversity (FD). has potential to address this need and provide new insights on nutritional diversity of cropping systems in rural Africa.   Methods and Findings Data on edible plant species diversity. food security and diet diversity were collected for 170 farms in three rural settings in Sub-Saharan Africa. Nutritional FD metrics were calculated based on farm species composition and species nutritional composition. Iron and vitamin A deficiency were determined from blood samples of 90 adult women. Nutritional FD metrics summarized the diversity of nutrients provided by the farm and showed variability between farms and villages. Regression of nutritional FD against species richness and expected FD enabled identification of key species that add nutrient diversity to the system and assessed the degree of redundancy for nutrient traits. Nutritional FD analysis demonstrated that depending on the original composition of species on farm or village. adding or removing individual species can have radically different outcomes for nutritional diversity. While correlations between nutritional FD. food and nutrition indicators were not significant at household level. associations between these variables were observed at village level …,True,_A_gaU4AAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,143,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021235,7843602036316576105,/scholar?cites=7843602036316576105,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021235,0,0,0

At the same time. over 1 billion people are overweight and obese in both the developed and developing world. Diseases previously associated with affluence. such as cancer. diabetes and cardio-vascular disease. are on the rise. Food system-based approaches to addressing these problems that could enhance food availability and diet quality through local production and agricultural biodiversity often fall outside the traditional scope of nutrition. and have been under-researched.

Brighton, UK: Institute for Development Studies",,,,The burden of undernutrition chronically afflicts 171 million children worldwide. This devastating circumstance has lifelong negative consequences such as stunted growth and impaired cognitive development that permanently disable a child’s potential to become a productive adult. One of the underlying reasons why undernutrition persists is because of the lack of credible and sustained government commitment to tackle the issue. This is likely to change however with renewed efforts to end undernutrition such as investing in lifesaving nutrition interventions for the most vulnerable. ensuring appropriate funding and building capacity to deliver those interventions. with a focus at the country level. Yet. the governance of the nutrition sector remains an under explored area in advancing the nutrition agenda. In the context of global efforts. eg the Scaling Up Nutrition movement. this is a critical time to understand how governance works best to improve nutrition outcomes in the developing world. and how nutritionists. development actors. civil society. private sector and donors can support government officials in sustaining political commitments over the long term.Why focus on the governance of the nutrition sector? Because governments need to demonstrate capacity. accountability and responsiveness to effectively reduce the burden of undernutrition.

To counter these years of neglect. the then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for “a uniquely African Green Revolution”. Since then. a number of initiatives have emerged or are emerging to realize this important vision. As more money and attention galvanizes much-needed action on the African Green Revolution. a vigorous debate is required to ensure that the mission of improving food security on the world’s poorest continent is achieved in the most effective. comprehensive and inclusive manner possible.

The activation of Rho GTPases is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) belonging to the Dbl family of proteins. The hallmark of this large family of GEFs is the presence of a tandem DH-PH module in which a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain is located at the C-terminus of a Dbl-homology (DH) domain. Recent studies have demonstrated that SWAP-70 constitutes a novel class of Rac-GEF. in which the PH domain is located at the N-terminus. rather than the C terminus. of the DH domain.

Understanding the causes includes approaching chronic malnutrition from the basic. underlying. and immediate levels. The causes reach from macro-level environmental influences to specific micronutrient intake. In order to effectively address stunting. it is important to understand the timing of stunting and the ability of individuals to catch-up in terms of linear growth. cognitive ability. and immune function. The consequences of chronic malnutrition are transgenerational. and they have an impact at the individual. community. and national level in the short- and long-term.

Several key conclusions emerge from this exercise: First. for a comparison of scenario results to be meaningful. a careful analysis of the interpretation of the relevant model variables is essential. For instance. the use of “real world commodity prices” differs widely across models. and comparing the prices without accounting for their different meanings can lead to misleading results.

We analyze mitigation associated with different productivity pathways using the global partial equilibrium model GLOBIOM. Our results confirm that yield increase could mitigate some agriculture-related emissions growth over the next decades.

As most biofuels are currently produced from land based crops. there is a concern that the increased consumption of biofuels requires agricultural expansion at a global scale. leading to additional carbon emissions. This effect is called Indirect Land Use Change. or ILUC. The EU Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC) directed the European Commission to develop a methodology to account for the ILUC effect. The current study serves to provide new insights to the European Commission and other stakeholders about these indirect carbon and land impacts from biofuels consumed in the EU. with more details on production processes and representation of individual feedstocks than was done before. ILUC cannot be observed or measured in reality. because it is entangled with a large number of other changes in agricultural markets at both global and local levels.

The three greenhouse gases (GHGs) have increased in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times. and this increase is the main driving cause of climate change (Chapter 10). CO2. CH4 and N2O altogether amount to 80% of the total radiative forcing from well-mixed GHGs (Chapter 8). The increase of CO2. CH4 and N2O is caused by anthropogenic emissions from the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy and from land use and land use changes. in particular agriculture. The observed change in the atmospheric concentration of CO2. CH4 and N2O results from the dynamic balance between anthropogenic emissions. and the perturbation of natural processes that leads to a partial removal of these gases from the atmosphere. Natural processes are linked to physical conditions. chemical reactions and biological transformations and they respond themselves to perturbed atmospheric composition and climate change. Therefore. the physical climate system and the biogeochemical cycles of CO2. CH4 and N2O are coupled. This chapter addresses the present human-caused perturbation of the biogeochemical cycles of CO2.

This net flux is the most uncertain term in the global carbon budget. not only because of uncertainties in rates of deforestation and forestation. but also because of uncertainties in the carbon density of the lands actually undergoing change. Furthermore. there are differences in approaches used to determine the flux that introduce variability into estimates in ways that are difficult to evaluate. and not all analyses consider the same types of management activities. Thirteen recent estimates of net carbon emissions from LULCC are summarized here. In addition to deforestation. all analyses considered changes in the area of agricultural lands (croplands and pastures). Some considered. also. forest management (wood harvest. shifting cultivation). None included emissions from the degradation of tropical peatlands.

It is also important to know the C3/C4 distribution for simulations of the carbon isotope composition of atmospheric CO2 owing to the distinct fractionations displayed by each photosynthetic type.

In response to high intakes of PHVOs. the Indian government has proposed regulation to set limits on the amount of trans fat permissible in PHVOs. Global recommendations are to replace PHVOs with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in order to optimise health benefits; however. little is known about the practicalities of implementation in low-income settings. The aim of this study was to examine the technical and economic feasibility of reducing trans fat in PHVOs and reformulating it using healthier fats. Thirteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with manufacturers and technical experts of PHVOs in India. Data were open-coded and organised according to key themes. Interviewees indicated that reformulating PHVOs was both economically and technically feasible provided that trans fat regulation takes account of the food technology challenges associated with product reformulation. However. there will be challenges in maintaining the physical properties that consumers prefer while reducing the trans fat in PHVOs. The availability of input oils was not seen to be a problem because of the low cost and high availability of imported palm oil. which was the input oil of choice for industry. Most interviewees were not concerned about the potential increase in saturated fat associated with increased use of palm oil and were not planning to use PUFAs in product reformulation.

Although several high-income countries have successfully reduced trans fat levels in foods. low- and middle-income countries such as India face additional challenges to its removal from the food supply. This study provides a systems analysis of the Indian food chain to assess intervention options for reducing trans fat intake in low-income consumers. Data were collected at the manufacturer. retailer and consumer levels. Qualitative interviews were conducted with vanaspati manufacturers (n = 13) and local food vendors (n = 44). Laboratory analyses (n = 39) of street foods/snacks sold by the vendors were also conducted. Trans fat and snack intakes were also examined in low-income consumers in two rural villages (n = 260) and an urban slum (n = 261). Manufacturers of vanaspati described reducing trans fat levels as feasible but identified challenges in using healthier oils. The fat content of sampled oils from street vendors contained high levels of saturated fat (24.7-69.3 % of total fat) and trans fat (0.1-29.9 % of total fat). Households were consuming snacks high in trans fat as part of daily diets (31 % village and 84.3 % of slum households) and 4 % of rural and 13 % of urban households exceeded WHO recommendations for trans fat intakes.

This limits the potential to model household consumption and lifestyles as mitigation options through their impact on economy-wide energy demand. We present a framework to estimate the economy-wide energy requirements and carbon emissions associated with future household consumption. by linking Industrial Ecology tools and Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). We apply the framework to assess final energy and emission pathways for meeting three essential and energy-intensive dimensions of basic well-being in India: food. housing and mobility.

The choices considered are for three main cooking fuels: firewood. kerosene. and LPG (liquid petroleum gas). The models. estimated using a large microeconomic dataset. show a reasonably good performance in the prediction of households' primary and secondary fuel choices. This suggests that ordered models can be used to analyze multiple fuel use patterns in the Indian context. The results show that lack of sufficient income is one of the main factors that retard households from using cleaner fuels. which usually also require the purchase of relatively expensive equipments.

This paper investigates the extent to which electricity access can be investigated using night-time light satellite data and spatially explicit population datasets to compare electricity access between 1990 and 2000. We present here the first satellite derived estimates of rural population without access to electricity in developing countries to draw insights on issues surrounding the delivery of electricity to populations in rural areas. The paper provides additional evidence of the slow progress in expansion of energy access to households in Sub-Saharan Africa and shows how this might be ascribed in part due to the low population densities in rural areas. The fact that this is a continent with some of the lowest per-capita income levels aggravates the intrinsic difficulties associated with …,True,rByx39UAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,191,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142151000385X,3944869915378524887,/scholar?cites=3944869915378524887,,,0,0,0

At the national and international scales there have been some efforts for constructing measures of energy poverty. However. much more needs to be done to develop an internationally consistent measurement framework and to put in place data collection systems that will enable regular reporting. At the programme and project level. indicator systems by necessity need to be designed for specific purposes. Nevertheless. the article proposes that in many instances it is desirable to widen the scope of metrics used for designing and evaluating policies and programmes.

Prior research has found that direct experience with PEVs increases consumers' stated purchase consideration. but these studies have used relatively long exposure times (days to months) with a PEV. To assess the effect of shorter exposure times (eg minutes) on stated purchase consideration. we conducted an experiment at the 2019 Washington DC Auto Show. Participants (n= 6518) were asked to rate their level of consideration to adopt a PEV before and after riding in one of four different PEVs for just 3–5 min. We find that the experience of riding in a PEV on average had a significant. positive effect on participants' consideration ratings. We also find that the vast majority of respondents were unable to correctly answer basic knowledge questions about refueling a PEV and …,True,DY2D56IAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,1,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aba715/meta,7993207781685164207,/scholar?cites=7993207781685164207,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aba715/pdf,0,0,0

Light-duty vehicle owners were asked in a series of choice tasks to choose among fuels that varied in type. price. CO 2 emissions. and location of origin for a hypothetical vehicle that could accept all fuels. We find that the majority of gasoline and E85 users are willing to substitute towards other fuels at today's prices and attributes. while diesel users have a strong preference for diesel fuel.

In 1900. the industry (whose primary competitor was the horse) comprised 40% steam-powered. 38% electric-powered. and 22% gasoline-powered vehicles. After the advent of mass-production. made famous by Henry Ford's 1908 Model T. the internal combustion engine rapidly became the dominant automotive technology. and by the 1930s competing technologies were all but extinct. Since then. the industry has followed a century-long trajectory of steady. incremental innovations that have gradually improved vehicle performance across a variety of metrics such as horsepower. fuel efficiency. emissions. and safety. The nation's more than four million miles of roads play a vital role in the economy. But maintaining them is expensive.

1171082,Why the US Trails the World in Electric Vehicles,2021,John Paul Helveston,37,Issues in Science and Technology,2,76-79,Issues in Science and Technology,But these incentives pale in comparison with the much more aggressive PEV policies in other countries. Take Norway. for example. where vehicle taxes are computed as a combination of several factors. including a vehicle’s weight and the amount of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide it emits. making larger. higherpolluting cars substantially more expensive than smaller. lower-polluting cars. In addition. PEVs are exempt from a 25% purchase value added tax. annual road taxes. and most parking fees and highway tolls. These heavily skewed tax policies make many current PEV models significantly less expensive to own and operate than most internal combustion engine vehicles without offering any direct purchase subsidies. But these policies are not cheap. A 2014 study estimated that the Norwegian government lost $8.100 in reduced tax revenue for each PEV sold. Using this figure. the government is estimated to have lost $1.62 billion in tax revenue for the approximately 200.000 PEVs registered in 2018 alone. Policies in China—the world’s largest PEV market by far—are even more proactive. In addition to the central government PEV purchase subsides. which are similar to those in the United States. policies such as license plate restrictions and fees give local provincial and city governments enormous leverage to incentivize PEV adoption. In Shanghai. for example. buyers of a PEV can save as much as $15.000 on a license plate. which are allocated via auction. In addition. PEV drivers in many larger cities are exempt from restrictions such as “road rationing” policies that limit driving to only every other day.

They are fun to drive. winning rave reviews from many drivers. The climate change benefits of electric vehicles are especially critical. Concentrations of heat-trapping gases are now higher than at any time since humans started walking the Earth—and climbing. We are already seeing the impacts. including more severe and frequent storms. floods. droughts and heat waves. More than 180 nations have now ratified the Paris Agreement. agreeing to work together to address this challenge and achieve net-zero emission globally by the second half of this century. That will require significant transformation in the transport sector with low carbon technologies such as electric drive trains. Electric vehicles are a small part of the global vehicle fleet but growing rapidly. Growth is especially strong in China. where drivers bought more electric vehicles last year than in the rest of the world combined. Growth is also significant in the United States. Japan and much of western Europe. In 2018 more than half of new cars sold in Norway had electric drive trains. These countries have many differences. Can they learn from each other with respect to electric vehicle deployment? We believe the answer is yes. This volume focuses in particular on urban policies. The authors find that. despite differences in size. political organization and other factors. the five cities in three countries studied face similar challenges with respect to deployment of electric vehicle infrastructure.

At the same time. China has also become home to distinct forms of industrial innovation. which often occur downstream in technology commercialization and redefinition (Brandt & Thun. 2010; Breznitz & Murphee. 2011; Ernst & Naughton. 2008). Some evidence suggests that these two themes could be synergistic; that is. despite having less stringent requirements in WTO negotiations (WTO. 1979). developing nations like China that receive large amounts of foreign investment may be able to successfully reduce pollution while contributing to industrial innovation (Wheeler. 2001). Given this context. what are the implications of China’s regulatory environment for local and multinational firms and their technology and innovation decisions? This symposium unpacks the tensions between China’s governmental structure and policies. opportunities for industrial innovation by local and multinational firms. and the implications for energy efficiency and the environment.Over the past three decades. China has emerged not only as an extraordinary global manufacturing powerhouse. but also as one of the world’s largest consumers across many industries. In the automobile industry. for example. China leads the world in both vehicle manufacturing. with approximately one quarter of 2012 global production (OICA. 2013a). and new vehicle sales. a title held since surpassing US sales in 2009 (OICA. 2013b).

The study shows stabilization as low as 450 ppm CO2-eq. to be technically feasible. even given relatively high baseline scenarios. To achieve these lower concentration levels. global emissions need to peak within the first two decades.

This requires unprecedented rates of decarbonization even in the short-run. The availability of the option of net negative emissions. such as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or reforestation/afforestation. allows to delay some of these emission reductions. In the paper. we assess the demand and potential for negative emissions in particular from BECCS. Both stylized calculations and model runs show that without the possibility of negative emissions. pathways meeting the 2 °C target with high probability need almost immediate emission reductions or simply become infeasible. The potential for negative emissions is uncertain.

Growing concern about these impacts has mobilized the international community to set new targets for universal modern energy access. However. analyses exploring pathways to achieve these targets and quantifying the potential costs and benefits are limited. Here. we use two modelling frameworks to analyse investments and consequences of achieving total rural electrification and universal access to clean-combusting cooking fuels and stoves by 2030.

The model covers the full modelling chain from economic activity. to materials consumption. trade. technology choice. production capacity. energy use and CO2 emissions. Without climate policy. the future projections based on the SSP2 scenario show a rapid increase in the consumption of steel and cement over the next few decades. after which demand levels are projected to stabilize. This implies that over the scenario period. CO2 emissions are projected to peak in the next decades followed by a decrease below 2010 levels in 2050. There is considerable scope to mitigate CO2 emissions from steel and cement industries. leading to resp. 80–90% and 40–80% reduction below 2010 in 2050 for a high carbon tax of 100 $/tCO2 + 4%pa depending on the availability of Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS).,True,c9m4sWUAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,141,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344916301008,18343499059572778737,/scholar?cites=18343499059572778737,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344916301008,0,0,0

Energy use and fuel choice is determined for five end-use functions (cooking. water heating. space heating. lighting and appliances) and for five different income quintiles in rural and urban areas. The paper specifically explores the consequences of different assumptions for income distribution and rural electrification on residential sector energy use and CO2 emissions. finding that results are clearly sensitive to variations in these parameters.

1171118,The impact of CO2 emissions trading on firm profits and market prices,2006,Robin Smale and Murray Hartley and Cameron Hepburn and John Ward and Michael Grubb,6,Climate Policy,1,31-48,Taylor & Francis Group,The introduction of mandatory controls and a trading scheme covering approximately half of all carbon dioxide emissions across Europe has triggered a debate about the impact of emissions trading on the competitiveness of European industry. Economic theory suggests that. in many sectors. businesses will pass on costs to customers and make net profits due to the impact on product prices combined with the extensive free allocations of allowances. This study applies the Cournot representation of an oligopoly market to five energy-intensive sectors: cement. newsprint. steel. aluminium and petroleum.

This article reviews and extends the long-standing debate about auctioning. in which economists have generally supported and industries opposed a greater use of auctioning. The article clarifies the key issues by reviewing six ‘traditional’ considerations. examines several credible options for auction design. and then proposes some new issues relevant to auctioning. It is concluded that greater auctioning in aggregate need not increase adverse competitiveness impacts. and could in some respects alleviate them. particularly by supporting border-tax adjustments. Auctioning within the 10% limit might also be used to dampen price volatility during 2008–2012 and. in subsequent periods. it offers the prospect of supporting a long-term price …,True,aaFsRFEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,349,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2006.9685592,8622825980015421416,/scholar?cites=8622825980015421416,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/183630/eprg0621.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Proponents saw the mechanisms as clever tools to ensure environmental outcomes were achieved at least cost. Reducing the costs of compliance. they argued. would make tighter environmental targets possible. and certainly more politically feasible. Detractors have argued that the flexible mechanisms commoditize Earth's atmosphere in a manner that will allow dubious projects and the exchange of “hot air” to substitute for serious engagement on climate change.

United Kingdom. SW11 3UE,Prescriptive economics requires that. unless there are very good reasons to the contrary. economic policy should be based on the principle that individuals’ preferences should count. Indeed. the entire body of ‘welfare economics’ centres round the formal identity of the statement “X prefers A to B” and the statement “X has higher welfare in A rather than B”. This combination of a seemingly innocuous and democratic value judgement—preferences should count—and a formal definition about the meaning of welfare improvement involves many complications. The entire history of policy analysis focuses on those complications. Whose preferences should count? Over what time period? What constitutes a legitimate attenuation of the basic value judgement? One of the problem areas concerns timediscounting—the process whereby society places a lower value on a future gain or loss than on the same gain or loss occurring now. The rationale for time-discounting follows logically from the basic value judgement of welfare economics. If people’s preferences count and if people prefer now to the future. those preferences must be integrated into social policy formulation. Time-discounting is thus universal in economic analysis. but it remains. as it always has. controversial. The controversy has a parallel in another form of discounting—spatial discounting.

Second. estimates differ by two orders of magnitude depending on the region to which the equity weights are normalised.

This was to be expected since its lead author. Sir Nicholas Stern. is not only a distinguished economist but has also made important contributions himself to areas of public and welfare economic theory (including discounting and the identification of ‘shadow prices’) that are particularly relevant to climate change economics.It has long been generally recognised by many philosophers and economists that climate change policy raises several difficult ethical problems. of which intergenerational justice is perhaps the most important. 1 But. unfortunately. this is not one on which philosophers have been able to provide much guidance. Indeed. according to Rawls. the problem of intergenerational justice is one that subjects ethical theory to ‘severe if not impossible tests’(Rawls. 1972. p. 284). It was entirely appropriate. therefore. that ethics was given explicit and prominent treatment in the Review.

In particular. several rationales for the use of time-varying social discount rates have emerged. These rationales range from the ad hoc to the formal. with some founded solely in economic theory while others reflect principles of intergenerational equity. While these advances are to be applauded. the practitioner is left with a confusing array of rationales and the sense that almost any discount rate can be justified.

Using IPCC carbon budgets and the IPCC’s AR5 scenario database. and assuming future emissions from other sectors are compatible with a 2°C pathway. we calculate that the 2°C capital stock for electricity will be reached by 2017 based on current trends. In other words. even under the very optimistic assumption that other sectors reduce emissions in line with a 2°C target. no new emitting electricity infrastructure can be built after 2017 for this target to be met. unless other electricity infrastructure is retired early or retrofitted with carbon capture technologies.

1171132,Discounting for climate change,2009,David Anthoff and Richard SJ Tol and Gary Yohe,3,"Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal",,,,It is well-known that the discount rate is crucially important for estimating the social cost of carbon. a standard indicator for the seriousness of climate change and desirable level of climate policy. The Ramsey equation for the discount rate has three components: the pure rate of time preference. a measure of relative risk aversion. and the rate of growth of per capita consumption. Much of the attention on the appropriate discount rate for long-term environmental problems has focussed on the role played by the pure rate of time preference in this formulation. We show that the other two elements are numerically just as important in considerations of anthropogenic climate change. The elasticity of the marginal utility with respect to consumption is particularly important because it assumes three roles: consumption smoothing over time. risk aversion. and inequity aversion. Given the large uncertainties about climate change and widely asymmetric impacts. the assumed rates of risk and inequity aversion can be expected to play significant roles. The consumption growth rate plays multiple roles. as well. It is one of the determinants of the discount rate. and one of the drivers of emissions and hence climate change. We also find that the impacts of climate change grow slower than income. so the effective discount rate is higher than the real discount rate. Moreover. the differential growth rate between rich and poor countries determines the time evolution of the size of the equity weights. As there are a number of crucial but uncertain parameters. it is no surprise that one can obtain almost any estimate of the social cost of carbon.

Increasingly. policymakers combine multiple policy tools to achieve this. for example by complementing cap-and-trade schemes with a carbon tax. or with a feed-in tariff. Often. the motivation for doing so is to limit undesirable fluctuations in the carbon price. either from rising too high or falling too low. This paper reviews the implications for the carbon price of combining cap-and-trade with other policy instruments. We find that price intervention may not always have the desired effect. Simply adding a carbon tax to an existing cap-and-trade system reduces the carbon price in the market to such an extent that the overall price signal (tax plus carbon price) may remain unchanged. Generous feed-in tariffs or renewable energy obligations within a capped area have the same effect: they undermine the carbon price in the rest of the trading regime. likely …,True,aaFsRFEAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,145,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S2010007810000169,16084456219371149396,/scholar?cites=16084456219371149396,,http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/37573/1/Combining_multiple_climate_policy_instruments_how_not_to_do_it%28lsero%29.pdf,0,0,0

1171137,A new global deal on climate change,2008,Cameron Hepburn and Nicholas Stern,24,Oxford Review of Economic Policy,2,259-279,Oxford University Press,A global target of stabilizing greenhouse-gas concentrations at between 450 and 550 parts per million carbon-dioxide equivalent (ppm CO2e) has proven robust to recent developments in the science and economics of climate change. Retrospective analysis of the Stern Review (2007) suggests that the risks were underestimated. indicating a stabilization target closer to 450 ppm CO2e.

This paper advances two arguments. First. it argues that the conventional view of Border Carbon Adjustments (BCAs) as a ‘dirty’ trade barrier should be turned on its head. Rather. the absence of a carbon price comprises an implicit subsidy to dirtier production in non-regulated markets. Second. BCAs could act as a game-changer when climate policy negotiations move at a glacial pace. if at all. Materially stronger progress could be achieved indirectly from the threat of unilateral trade policies. The paper shows how this could come about. using a simple political game theory model.

1171141,Recent advances in discounting: implications for forest economics,2007,Cameron J Hepburn and Phoebe Koundouri,13,,2-3,169-189,Elsevier,Discounting has played an important role in forestry economics because harvesting cycles are often much longer than project cycles for other investments. For high forests. for instance. most income is derived from thinning and felling up to 80 (sycamore and ash) or even 120 years (oak) after planting. Cost–benefit analysis of such long-term investments is enormously sensitive to the discount rate. Using conventional exponential discounting can generate recommendations that appear contrary to sustainability. if not commonsense.

1171142,A stated preference investigation into the Chinese demand for farmed vs. wild bear bile,2011,Adam J Dutton and Cameron Hepburn and David W Macdonald,6,PloS one,7,e21243,Public Library of Science,Farming of animals and plants has recently been considered not merely as a more efficient and plentiful supply of their products but also as a means of protecting wild populations from that trade. Amongst these nascent farming products might be listed bear bile. Bear bile has been exploited by traditional Chinese medicinalists for millennia. Since the 1980s consumers have had the options of: illegal wild gall bladders. bile extracted from caged live bears or the acid synthesised chemically. Despite these alternatives bears continue to be harvested from the wild. In this paper we use stated preference techniques using a random sample of the Chinese population to estimate demand functions for wild bear bile with and without competition from farmed bear bile. We find a willingness to pay considerably more for wild bear bile than farmed. Wild bear bile has low own price elasticity and cross price elasticity with farmed bear bile. The ability of farmed bear bile to reduce demand for wild bear bile is at best limited and. at prevailing prices. may be close to zero or have the opposite effect. The demand functions estimated suggest that the own price elasticity of wild bear bile is lower when competing with farmed bear bile than when it is the only option available. This means that the incumbent product may actually sell more items at a higher price when competing than when alone in the market. This finding may be of broader interest to behavioural economists as we argue that one explanation may be that as product choice increases price has less impact on decision making. For the wildlife farming debate this indicates that at some prices the introduction of …,True,aaFsRFEAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,95,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021243,2961518771672292061,/scholar?cites=2961518771672292061,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021243,0,0,0

DC: World Bank,'Economic losses from natural disasters totaled $92 billion in 2015.'Such statements. all too commonplace. assess the severity of disasters by no other measure than the damage inflicted on buildings. infrastructure. and agricultural production. But $1 in losses does not mean the same thing to a rich person that it does to a poor person; the gravity of a $92 billion loss depends on who experiences it. By focusing on aggregate losses—the traditional approach to disaster risk—we restrict our consideration to how disasters affect those wealthy enough to have assets to lose in the first place. and largely ignore the plight of poor people. This report moves beyond asset and production losses and shifts its attention to how natural disasters affect people’s well-being. Disasters are far greater threats to well-being than traditional estimates suggest. This approach provides a more nuanced view of natural disasters than usual reporting. and a perspective that takes fuller account of poor people’s vulnerabilities. Poor people suffer only a fraction of economic losses caused by disasters. but they bear the brunt of their consequences. Understanding the disproportionate vulnerability of poor people also makes the case for setting new intervention priorities to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the world’s poor. such as expanding financial inclusion. disaster risk and health insurance. social protection and adaptive safety nets. contingent finance and reserve funds. and universal access to early warning systems.

This Climatic Change Letter uses a global energy-economy model to address this gap by assessing in a common framework both the costs of climate policies and oil scarcity. taking into account macroeconomic feedbacks. It shows that both costs are of the same order of magnitude. Moreover. our results suggest that. in the context of a limited and uncertain amount of ultimately recoverable oil resources. climate policies reduce the world vulnerability to peak oil. Of course. specific policies could also reduce this vulnerability. But by shifting energy use toward coal. they would lead to soaring greenhouse gases emissions.

To answer this question. we model the dependence of the energy sector on both (1) polluting exhaustible resources and (2) long-lived capital such as power plants. To minimise adjustment costs. optimal investments in expensive renewable energy start before phasing out fossil-fuel consumption. and may even start before investing in gas-fired plants. Investment in gas-fired plants can reduce the need for expensive renewable investment in the short term. but they eventually need to be decommissioned to make room to carbon-free power in the long term. Simulations of the European Commission’s Energy Roadmap illustrate and quantify these results.,True,4NWiiqEAAAAJ:eO3_k5sD8BwC,40,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-018-0274-4,17373371760904180586,/scholar?cites=17373371760904180586,,,0,0,0

Conversely. environmental taxes are advocated as efficient policy instruments. But removing subsidies and taxing energy can be politically challenging because vulnerable households rely on low energy prices. This study analyzes the impact of energy price hikes on different income groups using an energy-extended input-output approach. Our results show that higher-income groups benefit more from low energy prices than low-income groups when tracing both direct and indirect (supply chain) effects of energy price variations. Energy subsidies are a very expensive option to transfer income to poor households. For example. in Latin America and the Caribbean. using energy subsidies would cost about $12 to transfer $1 of income to households in the poorest …,True,4NWiiqEAAAAJ:FiDNX6EVdGUC,33,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261918306834,5051014801773703040,/scholar?cites=5051014801773703040,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/208145/1/IDB-WP-0947.pdf,0,0,0

The paper proposes a tool to help decision makers identify the most promising policy options to reduce welfare losses from natural disasters. Applied to riverine and storm surge floods. earthquakes. windstorms. and tsunamis in 117 countries. the model provides estimates of country-level socioeconomic resilience. Because hazards disproportionally affect poor people. each $1 of global natural disaster-related asset loss is equivalent to a $1.6 reduction in the affected country's national income. on average.

This chapter proposes a framework to assess disaster-related consumption losses. starting from an estimate of the asset losses. and leading to the following findings. First. output losses after a disaster destroys part of the capital stock are better estimated by using the average—not the marginal—productivity of capital. A model that describes capital in the economy as a single homogeneous stock would systematically underestimate disaster output losses. compared with a model that tracks capital in different sectors with limited reallocation options.

If these policies are not global. this price decrease raises emissions in countries without CO2 abatement policies. generating “carbon leakage”. On the other hand. if the countries which abate CO2 emissions are net fossil fuel importers. they benefit from this price decrease. which reduces the abatement cost. In contrast. CO2 capture and storage (CCS) does not reduce fossil fuel demand. therefore it generates neither this type of leakage nor this negative feedback on abatement costs. We quantify these effects with the global hybrid general equilibrium model Imaclim-R and show that they are quantitatively important. Indeed. for a given unilateral abatement in OECD countries. leakage is more than halved in a scenario with CCS included among the abatement options. compared to a scenario prohibiting CCS. We show that the main reason for this difference in leakage is the above-mentioned international fossil fuel price feedback. This article does not intend to assess the desirability of CCS. which has many other pros and cons.

In other words. even under the very optimistic assumption that other sectors reduce emissions in line with a 2°C target. no new emitting electricity infrastructure can be built after 2017 for this target to be met. unless other electricity infrastructure is retired early or retrofitted with carbon capture technologies.

Using conventional Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) to convert SLCPs to “CO 2-equivalent” emissions misrepresents their impact on global temperature. Here we show that peak warming under a range of mitigation scenarios is determined by a linear combination of cumulative CO 2 emissions to the time of peak warming and non-CO 2 radiative forcing immediately prior to that time. This may be understood by expressing aggregate non-CO 2 forcing as cumulative CO 2 forcing-equivalent (CO 2-fe) emissions.

FAIR. is presented. which calculates atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and effective radiative forcing (ERF) from greenhouse gases. aerosols. ozone and other agents. Model runs are constrained to observed temperature change from 1880 to 2016 and produce a range of future projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The constrained estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). transient climate response (TCR) and transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) are 2.86 (2.01 to 4.22) K. 1.53 (1.05 to 2.41) K and 1.40 (0.96 to 2.23) K (1000 GtC)−1 (median and 5–95 % credible intervals).

It is usually defined in terms of the level of warming above the present for an abrupt halt of emissions. Owing to socioeconomic constraints. this situation is unlikely. so we focus on the committed warming from present-day fossil fuel assets. Here we show that if carbon-intensive infrastructure is phased out at the end of its design lifetime from the end of 2018. there is a 64% chance that peak global mean temperature rise remains below 1.5 C. Delaying mitigation until 2030 considerably reduces the likelihood that 1.5 C would be attainable even if the rate of fossil fuel retirement was accelerated.

An alternative is to frame emissions budgets in terms of CO2‐forcing‐equivalent (CO2‐fe) emissions—the CO2 emissions that would yield a given total anthropogenic radiative forcing pathway. Unlike conventional “CO2‐equivalent” emissions. these are directly related to warming by the TCRE and need to fall to zero to stabilize warming: hence.

Here we combine these with measures of regional/national contributions to climate change to develop an'emissions-emergence index'(EEI) linking regions'/countries' contributions to climate change with the emergent regional impacts of climate change. The EEI is a simple but robust indicator which captures relative contributions to and regional impacts from climate change.

In other words. even under the very optimistic assumption that other sectors reduce emissions in line with a 2°C target. no new emitting electricity infrastructure can be built after 2017 for this target to be met. unless other electricity infrastructure is retired early or retrofitted with carbon capture technologies.

The same energy that has lifted hundreds of millions of Indians out of desperate poverty is creating a massive middle class centered in the cities. A new study by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) suggests that if India continues its recent growth. average household incomes will triple over the next two decades and it will become the world’s 5th-largest consumer economy by 2025. up from 12th now. 1 Along the way. spending patterns will shift significantly as discretionary purchases capture a majority of consumer spending. India’s potential should make it a high priority for most consumer goods businesses. but to succeed in this complex market they must overcome major challenges.Private consumption has already played a much larger role in India’s growth than it has in that of other developing countries. In 2005 private spending reached about 17 trillion Indian rupees2 ($372 billion). accounting for more than 60 percent of India’s GDP. so in this respect the country is closer to developed economies such as Japan and the United States than are China and other fast-growing emerging markets in Asia (Exhibit 1).

Evidence we culled from research on the planning processes at 30 companies and work with more than 50 additional companies points to a common dispiriting explanation: the annual strategy review frequently amounts to little more than a stage on which business unit leaders present warmed-over updates of last year's presentations. take few risks in broaching new ideas. and strive above all to avoid embarrassment.

Proponents of each view question the ontological validity and explanatory power of the other. This paper argues that information theory. rooted in modern thermodynamics. offers the potential to integrate these two perspectives in a common and rigorous framework. Both evolution and self-organization can be generalized as computational processes that can be applied to human social phenomena. Under this view. evolution is a process of algorithmic search through a combinatorial design space. while self-organization is the result of non-zero sum gains from information aggregation. Evolution depends on the existence of self-organizing forces. and evolution acts on designs for self-organizing structures. The framework yields insights on the role of agency and the emergence of novelty.

Boomers will have to continue working beyond the traditional retirement age. and that will require important changes in public policy. business practices. and personal behavior. These adjustments have become even more urgent with the recent financial turmoil. which has sharply reduced the home values and financial investments of millions of boomers just as they approach retirement.Underlying the need for change is a reversal of trends that have been in operation since the 1960s.

Social scientists working in the new economics tradition argue that this theory has failed empirically on many points and that the 2008 financial crisis is only the latest and most obvious example.Defining what new economics is provides a greater challenge. As of yet there is no neatly synthesised theory to replace neoclassical orthodoxy (and some argue there never will be as the economy is too complex a system to be fully captured in a single theory).

In this chapter we shall summarize observations made in the volume thus far and complement them from a more geographical perspective. putting developments in the eight countries and eleven financial centres covered in the book in a global context.Perhaps the main conclusion of our book is that international financial centres have fared surprisingly well in the last decade. As the preceding chapters demonstrate. New York and London have recovered from the crisis relatively quickly and remain the leading global financial centres. even if the level of employment in financial services in New York has slightly declined. Paris and Frankfurt were affected by both the US subprime crisis and the Eurozone crisis. but they too have proved rather resilient. At the same time. chapters on China and Singapore document that their financial centres have grown quite spectacularly. Even the chapter on Tokyo points to a recent growth in its international financial activity. although in international finance Tokyo is definitely punching below Japan's economic weight.

This effect is enhanced in more stringent environmental policy regimes and diminished in countries which heavily subsidise fossil fuels. However. the divestment movement may have an unintended effect. insofar as domestic banks situated in countries with high divestment commitments and stringent environmental policies provide more finance to oil and gas companies abroad.

1171229,Natural Capital Credit Risk Assessment in Agricultural Lending: An Approach Based on the Natural Capital Protocol,2019,Francisco Ascui and Theodor Cojoianu,,"Natural Capital Finance Alliance: Oxford, UK",,,,It is increasingly recognised that financial institutions have significant impacts and dependencies on natural capital–defined as the stock of the world’s renewable and non-renewable natural resources and ecosystems that yield flows of environmental goods and services. which directly and indirectly underpin the global economy and human wellbeing. Historically. many of these impacts and dependencies have been overlooked. The value of goods and services that nature provides ‘for free’has often been ignored. and resources have typically been priced at their cost of extraction. rather than the cost of their replacement or substitution. which would promote more sustainable long-term use. Despite its importance. natural capital rarely appears on the balance sheets of corporations and is seldom taken into account in financial decision-making. These practices can ultimately translate into unpriced material risks for financial institutions that may emerge at either local or systemic levels. For example. natural capital risks may result in higher loan defaults or lower returns on equity than are currently priced into loan interest rates or equity valuations.The Natural Capital Finance Alliance (NCFA) is a finance-led initiative which seeks to address this gap by integrating natural capital considerations into decision-making for financial products and services. This requires the development of new decision support tools for different asset classes and financial products.

We know much at alliance and firm-level about the benefits and challenges associated with different types of alliance configurations. however there are still gaps in our knowledge about the connection between alliances and impacts on society and the environment. In this paper. we use a novel dataset of 217 strategic alliances that have emerged between January and April 2020 in response to the COVID-19 crisis. We analyze which alliances have emerged and how these alliances are tackling different needs related to the crisis. We find that alliances focus on three main categories of needs: core healthcare. pandemic management. and underlying social needs. We explore and categorise the types of alliance approaches associated with different needs. By doing so we provide a structure for identifying the connection between alliances and systemic challenges. We also identify drivers for the acceleration of inter-industry alliances including a close connection to user needs.

This dual objective function differentiates impact investing from other forms of investing that integrate environmental. social or governance (ESG) aspects which consider financial returns as primary objective with ESG outcomes being secondary ambitions. Despite being one the fastest growing asset classes. academic studies of impact investing remain rare. and an extensive analysis of impact investor characteristics is yet to be undertaken. Using a large dataset of over eight thousand private markets investment (PMI) firms around the world. we are able to differentiate between impact investors. ESG and conventional PMI firms. We unveil differences in their ownership structure. their asset class preferences. their sectoral focus and the types of partnerships they pursue to deliver impact in addition to financial returns.

1171235,Moral Hazard and the Market-Based Method: Does Using Renewable Energy Attributes in Emissions Reporting Affect Corporate Emissions Performance?,2020,Francisco Ascui and Matthew Brander and Theodor Cojoianu and Qian Li,,Available at SSRN 3753995,,,,An increasingly widespread accounting practice for electricity (scope 2) emissions. known as the ‘market-based method’. is problematic as it allows companies to use purchased renewable energy attributes (REAs) to report lower emissions. which therefore no longer reflect the actual location-based electricity generation emissions resulting from the company's electricity consumption. Using REAs therefore may create a moral hazard. as companies using these arrangements are insulated from the consequences of their actions and may thus have less incentive to genuinely reduce their emissions. We construct a year-on-year matched sample of firms using/not using REAs (2.716 firms with 12.700 firm-year observations from 2006 to 2018) and apply a two-way fixed effects difference-in-difference (DiD) method to investigate the effects of REA use on emissions performance. We find that firms using REAs increase their absolute energy consumption and absolute emissions (scope 1 and 2) relative to companies that do not use REAs. while simultaneously reducing their relative emissions intensities per unit revenue. and that all effects are more significant after three or more years of REA use. The observed intensity reductions do not indicate genuine improved emissions performance. however. as firms using REAs do not improve their energy efficiency. but instead have higher revenue and tend to be located in countries with lower location-based grid emission factors. We conclude that companies. investors. and customers should beware the potential for moral hazard arising from the use of the market-based method. and should ensure that renewable …,True,Yynh-cMAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3753995,,,,,0,0,0

One such example relates to climate change. where a nature study shows that climate change contrarians are featured in 49% more media articles than scientists. despite the overwhelming consensus in the scientific community over the significance of anthropogenic climate change. In addition. many companies worldwide make inaccurate and often misleading claims about their environmental and social performance. which in turn has led to the widespread practice of greenwashing.

However. a global understanding of such innovations is limited. due to a lack of an underlying taxonomy and benchmark datasets in the FinTech domain. To address this limitation. we develop a FinTech taxonomy and manually annotate a set of FinTech patent abstracts according to the taxonomy. We use the annotated dataset to train deep learning models. Experimental results show that the deep learning models can accurately identify FinTech innovations.

A focus on the financial sector cannot overlook the importance of information systems and decision-making processes of financial intermediaries. Hence. a secondary aim of the thesis is to explore the geographical scope of information systems and decision-making process of financial intermediaries. including that of emerging fintech intermediaries. Finally. the thesis is also concerned with explaining the role of environmental policy on the decision making of financial intermediaries. companies and entrepreneurs alike. The four substantive chapters focus on different types of intermediaries and clients. whose geographical scope allows for the exploration of different configurations of the finance - technology - environment nexus. First. the thesis explores how fossil fuel divestment commitments and environmental policies have shaped the geography of capital flows into the oil and gas sector. I find that the total assets pledged for divestment in a given country is negatively associated with capital flows to domestic oil and gas companies. particularly when divestment is led by regional or sovereign governments.

These factors include the effects of physical climate change as well as societal and regulatory responses to climate change. Despite the increasing prominence of these stranded assets as a topic of significant interest to academics. governments. financial institutions. and corporations. there has been little work specifically looking at this issue in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This is a significant omission. given the region’s exposure to environment-related risk factors. the presence of extensive fossil fuel resources that may become “unburnable” given carbon budget constraints. and the particular challenges and opportunities facing lower-income and emerging economies in LAC.This report includes an extensive literature review. reviews of case studies. in-depth interviews. extensive informal consultation. and a survey instrument to identify gaps in the stranded asset literature. The report builds on work undertaken in 2015 by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) on the issue of stranded assets.

Here. using state-of-the-art carbon–climate models. we quantify the trade-off between these two options in RCP2. 6: an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario likely to limit global warming below 2 C. In our best-case illustrative assumption of conventional mitigation. negative emissions of 0.5–3 Gt C (gigatonnes of carbon) per year and storage capacity of 50–250 Gt C are required. In our worst case. those requirements are 7–11 Gt C per year and 1.000–1.600 Gt C. respectively.

To this end. the hybrid general equilibrium modeling framework Imaclim-R is employed as it allows for transitory partial adjustments of the economy and captures their impact on the dynamics of economic growth.

This Climatic Change Letter uses a global energy-economy model to address this gap by assessing in a common framework both the costs of climate policies and oil scarcity. taking into account macroeconomic feedbacks. It shows that both costs are of the same order of magnitude. Moreover. our results suggest that. in the context of a limited and uncertain amount of ultimately recoverable oil resources. climate policies reduce the world vulnerability to peak oil. Of course. specific policies could also reduce this vulnerability. But by shifting energy use toward coal. they would lead to soaring greenhouse gases emissions. Climate policies. instead. can yield benefits from both sides: avoiding dangerous climate change (Mastrandrea and Schneider 2004) and hedging against the uncertainty on oil resources.,True,pfFQYhcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,87,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=3664,15479776292735834841,/scholar?cites=15479776292735834841,,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/5451.pdf,0,0,0

This paper proposes a methodology to develop SSPs with a “backwards” approach based on (i) an a priori identification of potential drivers of mitigation and adaptation challenges; (ii) a modelling exercise to transform these drivers into a large set of scenarios; (iii) an a posteriori selection of a few SSPs among these scenarios using statistical cluster-finding algorithms.

The energy–economy–environment (E3) IMACLIM-R model is used to provide a detailed representation of passenger and freight transportation. Unlike many of the E3 models used to simulate mitigation options. IMACLIM-R represents both the technological and behavioural determinants of mobility. By comparing business-as-usual. carbon price only. and carbon price combined with transport policy scenarios. it is demonstrated that the measures that foster a modal shift towards low-carbon modes and a decoupling of mobility needs from economic activity significantly modify the sectoral distribution of mitigation efforts and reduce the level of carbon tax necessary to reach a …,True,pfFQYhcAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC,83,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2012.735916,2790294810876055281,/scholar?cites=2790294810876055281,,https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/799119/filename/WAISMAN_et_al._-_Transport_and_LCS_FINAL_HAL.pdf?frbrVersion=14,0,0,0

However. in the great majority of studies with a handful of scenarios or scenario categories. both scenario developers and users capture only a subset of future uncertainties. We propose three focal points for reinvigorating the scenario technique to expand uncertainty consideration: (1) to ensure that scenario developers embrace an increased space of multidimensional uncertainties. (2) to facilitate the process of scenario users capturing this space. and (3) to evaluate and iteratively revise the improvement progress.

It demonstrates three policy-relevant aspects of the carbon content of electricity that are implicit in most integrated assessment model results but under-discussed in academia and the policy debate. First. climate stabilization at any level from 1.5 °C to 3 °C requires the carbon content of electricity to decrease quickly and become almost carbon-free before the end of the century.

Advanced vehicles powered by low-carbon sources of electricity or hydrogen offer an alternative to conventional fossil-fuelled technologies. Yet. despite ambitious pledges and investments by governments and automakers. it is by no means clear that these vehicles will ultimately reach mass-market consumers.

We seek to identify households who run the risk of facing difficulties if fuel prices increase. We show that fuel poverty indicators from the domestic sector are not satisfactory in this regard. They fail to take into account three specificities of the transport sector: (1) the diversity of travel needs. (2) restriction behaviours. and (3) variable capacities to adapt. We propose a composite indicator that targets factors of vulnerabilities. In contrast to the previous indicators. it does not solely focus on budgetary aspects but also reflects conditions of mobility. Three levels of exposition to rising fuel prices are considered. depending on the combinations of factors. We test this indicator on French data and find that 7.8% of French households are identified fuel poor. a further 7.4% fuel vulnerable and a further 3.7% fuel dependent.,True,pfFQYhcAAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC,42,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629616300123,6722180400953506511,/scholar?cites=6722180400953506511,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01277414/document,0,0,0

Nevertheless. refugee resettlement processes in most countries are ad hoc. accounting for neither the priorities of hosting communities nor the preferences of refugees themselves. Building on models from two-sided matching theory. we introduce a new framework for matching with multidimensional constraints that models refugee families’ needs for multiple units of different services. as well as the service capacities of local areas. We propose several refugee resettlement mechanisms that can be used by hosting countries under various institutional and informational constraints. Our mechanisms can improve match efficiency. incentivize refugees to report where they would like to settle. and respect priorities of local areas thereby encouraging them to accept more refugees overall.

The measures are also closely related to various dimensionality reduction methods. such as diffusion maps and correspondence analysis. Our results shed new light on the ECI’s empirical success in explaining cross-country differences in gross domestic product per capita and economic growth. which is often linked to the diversity of country export baskets.

We propose a centralized clearinghouse—a ‘two-sided matching system’—to match refugees with localities.

The novel networked market structure accounts for distribution system operator-to-aggregator and aggregator-to-prosumer ICT infrastructure and contractual arrangements. which may limit which participants can negotiate transactions with one another.

1171281,Political Economy of Climate Change Policy,2013,Franklin Steves and Alexander Teytelboym,,Smith School of Enterprise and The Environment Working Paper,,,,Anthropogenic climate change poses a threat to all people and governments. but the response to that threat varies enormously across countries. Some adopt politically costly and economically challenging climate change mitigation policies. while others deny that climate change is occurring. Why do some countries adopt effective climate change policies while others do not? To answer this fundamental question. this paper analyses the political economy determinants of climate change policy around the world. In order to measure climate change policy. we introduce a new index. the ‘Climate Laws. Institutions and Measures Index’(CLIMI). the first systematic attempt to measure countries’ policy responses to the risk of climate change. CLIMI covers all the relevant institutions and sector-specific policies in 95 countries. representing 90% of the world’s GHG emissions. We then use CLIMI to examine the political and economic factors that determine countries’ choices to implement policies to tackle climate change. We find that the level of democracy alone is not a major driver of climate change policy adoption. but that public knowledge of climate change is. Not surprisingly. a high concentration of carbon-intensive industry in the economy hinders the adoption of climate change policy. Countries in which the citizenry has a better public awareness of climate change have more effective climate policies regardless of the presence of democratic institutions.,True,tG7EDLgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,39,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2456538,13729648577318118614,/scholar?cites=13729648577318118614,,https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/publications/wpapers/workingpaper13-06.pdf,0,0,0
1171282,A simple model of cascades in networks,2015,Yongwhan Lim and Asuman Ozdaglar and Alexander Teytelboym,,"Working Paper, Tech. Rep.",,,,We consider a linear threshold model of cascades in networks. An agent switches (eg adopts an innovation) if the proportion of his neighbors who have already switched exceeds his threshold. Agents’ thresholds are drawn randomly at the start of the cascade process. We present a result for the expected number of switches in arbitrary finite networks with any initial seeds. We define a new measure of an agent’s ability to influence a cascade in a given network. called cascade centrality. which is the expected size of the cascade when the agent is the only seed in the network. We then define contagion centrality. which is the probability that all agents switch when the node is a seed. For certain network topologies. we find analytic expressions for cascade centrality and contagion centrality and show that there may be tension between them. Yet nodes with high cascade and contagion centrality share an interesting property: they have many neighbors. but their neighbors have few neighbors. As an illustration of cascade centrality. we look at how the network structure affects optimal prices when a profitmaximizing firm tries to spread an innovation. Optimal price and seeding behavior can be counterintuitive when firms price irreversible cascades. Our tractable model can be extended in various ways.,True,tG7EDLgAAAAJ:rqnDXT1GswoC,31,http://www.t8el.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SimpleCascades.pdf,8674148613586512239,/scholar?cites=8674148613586512239,,http://www.t8el.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SimpleCascades.pdf,0,0,0

We propose a centralised clearinghouse – a “two-sided matching system” – to match refugees with States. Drawing on the success of matching in domains. such as education and healthcare. we outline the principles underlying matching system design and illustrate in general terms how they could be applied to refugee protection. This matching system respects the priorities of States and gives agency to refugees. Matching systems can operate independently or alongside other burden-sharing mechanisms. such as tradable refugee quotas (as suggested by Fernández-Huertas Moraga and Rapoport).

Oxford Department of International Development,Syrians fleeing the current conflict have been repeatedly told that they cannot choose the state in which they seek long-term protection. In Australia. the idea that asylum seekers are shopping for the best sanctuary forms a persistent part of the rhetoric around keeping them out. In these and other cases. the premise is that it is unjustifiable for refugees to be allowed some choice over where they seek protection. The consequence enshrined in the Dublin Regulation is that refugees may apply for asylum in only one European Union country. From the perspective of states. refugee flows are chaotic. unpredictable and widely regarded as socially disruptive and destabilising. Everyone recognises that the Dublin Regulation. which seeks to address this by placing the obligation to render asylum on the first EU country an asylum seeker reaches. is not fit for purpose.

Johnson Alengaram and Mohd Zamin Jumaat and Hilmi Mahmud,23,European Journal of Scientific Research,3,406-420,,This paper presents the results on the structural behavior of palm kernel shell concrete and its comparison with normal weight concrete (NWC). The structural grade palm kernel shell concrete. a lightweight concrete (LWC) produced using palm kernel shell (PKS) an agricultural waste and by-product of the production of palm oil as lightweight aggregate. referred to hereafter as PKSC. The concrete is of grade 30 and the reinforced concrete beams of size 150 mm x 250 mm x 2100 mm were prepared to study the structural behavior. Similar grade concrete using NWC were also prepared and reinforced. The flexural behavior of under-reinforced concrete beams of grade 30 concrete has been studied and the results are compared with NWC beams which were also designed as grade 30 and under-reinforced similar to that of the PKSC beams. Ten percent of silica fume and five percent of class-F fly ash on cement weight were used as additional and cement replacement cementitious materials respectively. Each beam was tested under two-point loading for flexure until failure.It has been observed from the experimental investigation of the beams. that the moment capacity of PKSC beams was higher than NWC beams by about three percent. In addition. the mode of failure observed in PKSC was ductile compared to the brittle failure of NWC beams. Thus. the PKSC beams showed a ductile failure. giving amble warning before failure happened. PKSC beams also exhibited a lot of cracking thus the crack width and crack spacing was small. The other advantage for PKSC beams was deflection.

Eleven mixtures were prepared with varying binder contents with the POFA content varying between 25% and 100%; the other constituent materials such as fine aggregate and water were kept constant. All the specimens were cured in oven for 24 h at 65 °C and thereafter kept in room temperature (about 26–29 °C) before testing for the compressive strength. The highest compressive strength of about 66 MPa was achieved for the mortar containing 30% of POFA and 70% of GGBS with a total binder content of 460 kg/m3. The increase in the POFA content beyond 30% reduces the compressive strength.

The variable investigated includes the quantities of replacement levels of M-sand. QD. and conventional mining sand (N-sand) in two concentrated alkaline solutions; the contents of alkaline solution. water. POFA/FA ratio. and curing condition remained constant. The results show that an average of 76% of the 28-day compressive strength was found at the age of 3 days. The rate of strength development from 3 to 7 days was found between 12 and 16% and it was found much less beyond this period. The addition of 100% M-sand and QD shows insignificant strength reduction compared to mixtures with 100% N-sand. The particle angularity and texture of fine aggregates played a significant role in the strength development due to the filling and packing ability. The rough texture and surface of QD enables stronger bond between the paste and the fine aggregate. The concentration of alkaline solution increased the reaction rate and thus enhanced the development of early age strength. The use of M-sand and QD in the development of geopolymer concrete is recommended as the strength variation between these waste materials and conventional sand is not high.,True,OkZjiS4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,24,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2014/245473/abs/,11655129777279011762,/scholar?cites=11655129777279011762,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2014/245473/abs/,0,0,0

Tamilnadu using Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (NRCS-CN) method with GIS and Remote sensing techniques. Methods: The GIS and remote sensing techniques facilitate accurate estimation of surface runof from watershed. Thematic maps such as soil map. land use and hydrologic soil group (HSG) maps have been generated with GIS environment. Weighted CN value for the basin was obtained and the runof for the selected rainfall event was estimated. Findings: In the HSG map. the region predominantly comprises of group B (56%) followed by group C (27.4%). group D (12.4%) and A (3.9%) respectively. In order to calculate the CN value of the basin. it is divided into 12 sub basins of which each sub basin has area less than 150km2 which gives more accurate result than considering the whole basin. The CN values for these 12 sub basins are ranging from 69 to 80. Composite curve number value for each sub-basin was calculated by multiplying weights according to the area occupied by each land use class and the corresponding curve number. Weighted CN value and the storage retention (S) for the entire basin are estimated as 75 and 85 respectively. Runof values are estimated on four diferent rainfall events selected during the study period in this basin. Conclusion: The study ultimately leads to the development of the rainfall runof model based on NRCS-CN-GIS technique.

Compared to the second-order partial differential equations of classical elasticity. in its most general format gradient elasticity also contains fourth-order spatial. temporal as well as mixed spatial-temporal derivatives. The inclusion of the various higher-order terms has been motivated through arguments of causality and asymptotic accuracy. but for numerical implementations it is also important that standard discretization tools can be used for the interpolation in space and the integration in time. In this paper. we will formulate four different simplifications of the general gradient elasticity theory.

Simple methods of predicting the effect of clearing on reducing the blast loading impulse have been available for many years. but recent studies have questioned the accuracy and physical basis of these approaches. Consequently. several authors have used numerical modelling and/or experimental techniques to determine empirical predictive methods for the clearing effect.

Ltd.,In his article a special form of gradient elasticity is presented that can be used to describe wave dispersion. This new format of gradient elasticity is an appropriate dynamic extension of the earlier static counterpart of the gradient elasticity theory advocated in the early 1990s by Aifantis and co‐workers. In order to capture dispersion of propagating waves. both higher‐order inertia and higher‐order stiffness contributions are included. a fact which implies (and is denoted as) dynamic consistency. The two higher‐order terms are accompanied by two associated length scales. To facilitate finite element implementations. the model is rewritten such that 𝒞0‐continuity of the interpolation is sufficient.

For small targets. the time taken for this clearing wave to traverse the loaded face will be small in relation to the duration of loading. Previous studies have not shown what happens in the late-time stages of clearing relief. nor the mechanism by which the cleared reflected pressure decays to approach the incident pressure. Current design guidance assumes a series of interacting clearing waves propagate over the target face – this assumption is tested in this article by using numerical analysis to evaluate the blast pressure acting on small targets subjected to blast loads.

The model itself. which uses planes of degradation that can undergo damage and separation but that can regain contact according to a contact law. is described. The first enhancement is a new damage evolution function which provides a completely smooth transition from the undamaged to the damaged state and from pre-peak to post-peak regions. The second is an improved contact function that governs the potential degree of contact with increasing opening on a crack plane. The use of a damage evolution function with a pre-peak has implications for the consistent tangent matrix/stress recovery algorithm developed for the model implementation. and amendments to this algorithm to accommodate the new function are described. A series of unpublished experimental tests on notched specimens undertaken in Cardiff in the mid 1990s are then described. These include notched beam tests as well as prismatic and cylindrical torsion tests. The tests are then considered in three dimensional finite element analyses using the modified Craft model implemented in the finite element program LUSAS. Comparisons between experimental and numerical data show reasonable agreement except that the numerical simulations do not fully describe the latter stages of the softening responses for the torsion examples.

Whilst this method is suitable for cases where the reflecting surface is large. it is well known that for smaller targets. the propagation of a rarefaction ‘clearing’ wave from the edges of the target may cause a premature reduction in the magnitude of the blast pressure and hence reduce the total impulse acting on the structure.

The key idea is to introduce the gradient-type enrichment at the level of displacements (rather than some internal variable). so the model is formulated with two distinct displacement fields. In fact. gradient models based on two displacement fields are usual in non-local elasticity. where the goal is to avoid the shortcomings of classical (local) elasticity (i.e. strain singularities in statics. non-dispersive behaviour in dynamics). We show that such a gradient elasticity backbone model can be combined with any standard nonlinear constitutive driver to render a regularised model for softening inelasticity. To illustrate the generality of the approach. two prototype models (isotropic damage and von Mises plasticity) are discussed.

This paper demonstrates the results of an experimental-numerical study to investigate the cement sheath integrity after being subjected an enhanced pressure. A constitutive model specifically formulated for the modelling of quasi-brittle materials is applied to the investigation of cement sheath integrity. incorporating both compression and tensile damage mechanisms.

A numerical method is adopted using material properties (moisture transport. free shrinkage. mechanical and fatigue) derived from experiments. It is shown that surface micro-cracks initially develop predominantly due to differential shrinkage (curling). These micro-cracks penetrate down to approximately a quarter of the slab thickness and it is shown that they reduce the ultimate load bearing and fatigue capacity of the pavement by up to 50 %. Even though shrinkage does not initially induce visible cracks. it significantly intensifies the crack opening due to traffic load by up to 500 % for a crack width of 0.5 mm.

In this short note. we investigate two numerical discretisation aspects of such a model. Firstly. the critical time step is derived which is relevant for conditionally stable time integrators.

This is achieved by taking a third order variation of the longitudinal displacement over the beam depth for the two layers separately. The deformable shear connectors joining the two different material layers are modelled as distributed shear springs along the beam length at their interface. In order to capture the geometric nonlinear effects of the beam. the Green-Lagrange strain vector is used to develop the one dimensional finite element model. The nonlinear governing equations are solved by an incremental-iterative technique following the Newton-Raphson method.

Simple. semi-empirical approaches for the prediction of blast impulse on a structure are well established and are accurate in cases where the lateral dimensions of the structure are sufficiently large. However. if the lateral dimensions of the target are relatively small in comparison to the length of the incoming blast wave. air flow around the edges of the structure will lead to the propagation of rarefaction or clearing waves across the face of the target. resulting in a premature reduction of load and hence. a reduction in the total impulse imparted to the structure. This effect is well-known; semi-empirical models for the prediction of clearing exist. but several recent numerical and experimental studies have cast doubt on their accuracy and physical basis.

Clean water is the need of hour. but the amount of clean water available in earth is drastically reduced due to water pollution caused by industrialization and rapid urbanization. Overall global climatic and seasonal changes also have a significant impact on the reduction of amount of fresh water. The need for clean water is continuously growing due to rise in human residents for the last few decades. Use of contaminated water leads to several water borne diseases and based on the intensity of contamination sometimes it leads to death. There are various processes for obtaining fresh water from contaminated water. but the most economical and preferable method is solar distillation since the process involved in it is similar to natural hydrological cycle which requires only solar energy for its operation.

Solar still is the economical way to obtain fresh water since it solely requires the energy from the sun alone for its operation. which is abundantly and freely available in nature.

The present study deals with the experimental investigation on the influence of regular inserts and aluminium oxide nanoparticles on micro finned tube over heat transfer and hydraulic performance under laminar flow. Results revealed that the influence of nanoparticle with the base fluid at higher loading enhanced the convective heat transfer and lowered the friction characteristics. Similarly. at higher flow rates the heat transfer characteristics increases and friction decreases. It is also found that the thermal performance enhancement characteristics decreases with higher flow rates and increases with higher particle loading. It is also inferred that the enhancement of Nusselt number and PEC is not only due to the addition of nanoaprticle also due to the twisted tape inserts.,True,zYOH2ooAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0026199,,,,,0,0,0

Furthermore. to enhance the thermal performance index of conventional SAH. additional enhancement such as coating and staggered fins are fixed to the absorber plate of duct which simultaneously increases the turbulent intensity. kinetic energy to enhance the temperature of outlet air. Comparisons are made with a solar air heater without coating and staggered fin in order to assess the thermal performance. Experiments were conducted on a continuous basis and the flow rates of air flowing through the duct are varied. Experimental results revealed that the effect of coating improved the plate temperature to a maximum of 102 C while the modified SAH coated with ordinary black paint and staggered fin arrangement is found as 95 C for the flow rate of mf= 0.03 kg/s. The difference in temperature between exit and inlet of conventional SAH with coating alone is found as 13.09 C at a flow rate of mf= 0.03 kg/s whereas the average thermal efficiency is found as 22.3%.

However. historic efficiency improvements have not always translated into reduced rates of fuel consumption. Instead. most of the technological progress of the past 20 years has been dedicated to offsetting increased acceleration performance. while fuel consumption has languished. This work addresses the questions of (1) why new technology is dedicated to performance rather than fuel consumption. and (2) what policy structures and stringencies can most effectively encourage new technology to be dedicated to reducing fuel consumption. A technology allocation model was developed which couples projections of fuel consumption and performance tradeoffs to consumers' willingness to pay for these attributes. in order to maximize the combined value of these attributes to consumers. The model was calibrated using stated willingness to pay. car price data. and historic trends in performance and fuel consumption. The model was used to investigate the effects of various policies on the balance between performance and fuel consumption. Particular attention was paid to the Emphasis on Reducing Fuel Consumption (ERFC). which quantifies the amount of technology dedicated to improving fuel consumption rather than other attributes. Under baseline conditions of constant gasoline price and no policy intervention. the majority of new technology continues to flow to increasing performance.

The paper uses these methods to compare the travel time and costs of trips taken by car2go with the time and costs of taking the same trips by transit. to better understand how car2go may complement and/or compete with transit. The authors identify 237.000 car2go trips by observing available vehicles each minute from January 23 to May 10. 2016 through car2go’s application programming interface (API). The authors estimate driving times using the Google Maps API. developing a correction factor to account for temporal variation in traffic conditions. and develop a method to infer the average walking time to reach a car2go vehicle based on the locations of nearby vehicles. The authors estimate that the average car2go trip in Seattle costs $7.27 and involves 5.5 minutes of walking and 11 minutes of driving time. compared with 6 minutes walking. 13.6 minutes waiting. and 28 minutes in-vehicle time for the same trip by transit. Surprisingly. the authors find that although car2go complements transit by serving late-night trips and providing a faster but more costly alternative. it is not used disproportionately for trips where it offers especially large travel time savings compared with transit.,True,l_7Jfh4AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,14,https://trid.trb.org/view/1439488,773573037061934670,/scholar?cites=773573037061934670,,,0,0,0
1171546,Modeling charging choices of small-battery plug-in hybrid electric vehicle drivers by using instrumented vehicle data,2016,Haixiao Yu and Don MacKenzie,2572,Transportation Research Record,1,56-65,SAGE Publications,Methods for modeling plug-in hybrid electric vehicle drivers’ choices of whether to charge at the end of a trip are compared. Instrumented vehicle data from 125 preproduction Toyota Prius plug-in hybrids were combined with electric vehicle supply equipment (i.e.. charging station) location data from multiple sources. including PlugShare and the U.S. Department of Energy. The effects of factors including battery state of charge (SOC). dwell time. and location on the probability that a driver will charge during a stop were then modeled for locations where charging was possible. The amount of energy that can be transferred during a charging session was a better predictor of charging behavior than SOC and dwell time considered independently. Results were sensitive to data and methods used to identify charging locations. which indicated that caution is needed in this area.

However. evidence indicates that PHEVs are often plugged in more frequently than BEVs in practice. This is somewhat paradoxical: drivers for whom plugging in is optional tend to do so more frequently than those for whom it is necessary. This has led to the coining of a new term – “gas anxiety” – to describe the apparent desire of PHEV drivers to avoid using gasoline. In this paper. we analyze the variables influencing the charging choices of PHEV owners. testing whether drivers express preferences consistent with the concept of gas anxiety.

The authors use data that was gathered by 43.000 students. and offers unique. unbiased. full-trip access. Each student was wearing a sensor that tracks location and physical parameters. At the beginning of this analysis. the authors’ hypotheses were that (a) private transportation modes are substantially faster. more convenient. and more comfortable than public modes;(b) people living close to public transportation infrastructure will use it preferentially; and (c) students choose routes that minimize walking distance even if it increases their overall travel distance. These hypotheses were tested by examining descriptive statistics about the data set which the authors present together with a novel approach to comparing observed travel behavior with Google Directions suggestions. The authors find that contrary to our first two hypotheses. students traveling in private cars are less than 10km/hr faster for their door-to-door commute than their peers who use public transport. Students living close to metro stations do not necessarily choose to travel by train despite a very comprehensive and convenient network.

This study investigates how highly automated vehicles (AVs) may affect VoTT. using an existing mode—ridehailing services (RHS)—as an analogy for AVs. Both AVs and RHS relieve travelers from the effort of driving and allow them to participate in other activities while traveling. In a stated choice experiment. respondents chose between driving a personal vehicle or taking an RHS. with each mode characterized by a cost and travel time. Analysis results using a mixed logit model indicated that the VoTT was 13% lower when being driven in an RHS than when driving a personal car.

1171554,Fuel Economy Regulations and Efficiency Technology Improvements in US Cars Since 1975,2013,Donald Warren MacKenzie,,,,,,Light-duty vehicles account for 43% of petroleum consumption and 23% of green- house gas emissions in the United States. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards are the primary policy tool addressing petroleum consumption in the U.S.. and are set to tighten substantially through 2025. In this dissertation. I address several interconnected questions on the technical. policy. and market aspects of fuel consumption reduction. I begin by quantifying historic improvements in fuel eciency technologies since the 1970s. First. I develop a linear regression model of acceleration performance conditional on power. weight. powertrain. and body characteristics. showing that vehicles today accelerate 20-30% faster than vehicles with similar specifications in the 1970s. Second. I nd that growing use of alternative materials and a switch to more weight-ecient vehicle architectures since 1975 have cut the weight of today's new cars by approximately 790 kg (46%). Integrating these results with model-level specification data. I estimate that the average fuel economy of new cars could have tripled from 1975{2009. if not for changes in performance. size. and features over this period. The pace of improvements was not uniform. averaging 5% annually from 1975{1990. but only 2% annually since then. I conclude that the 2025 standards can be met through improvements in eciency technology. if we can return to 1980s rates of improvement. and growth in acceleration performance and feature content is curtailed. I next test the hypotheses that higher fuel prices and more stringent CAFE standards cause automotive rms to deploy eciency technologies more …,True,l_7Jfh4AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,10,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/80888,13700139375876427172,/scholar?cites=13700139375876427172,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/80888/857791992-MIT.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

To examine this relationship in Washington state. the expected adoption rate of EVs in each zip code was estimated by using a zero-inflated negative binomial model and then compared with the current adoption rate of EVs. The difference between expected and actual number of EVs in each zip code was then examined to determine whether it corresponded to the density of current DC fast charging stations in that zip code or adjacent zip codes. Results showed that in the northern and eastern parts of the state there are few DCFC charging stations and also lower than expected EV adoption rates. In contrast. the western part of the state showed higher EV adoption than predicted based on sociodemographic characteristics. along with a much greater concentration of DCFC stations.

1171566,Automotive features: mass impact and deployment characterization,2011,Stephen M Zoepf,,,,,,Passenger car use is a major driver of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil fuel consumption in the United States. Vehicles continue to incorporate increasing levels of technology. these advances do not translate directly into improved fuel economy. Vehicle weight. interior volume and performance have all grown substantially in the past 30 years. as has feature content. This thesis shows that safety features. emissions controls. and optional equipment account for a total mass that mirrors growth in vehicle mass during this time period. Chief among these are optional features designed to improve the comfort and convenience of passenger cars. This thesis also examines historical deployment rates of vehicle features. Safety features and emissions controls achieve faster deployment rates than other optional features. While these features are those most governed by regulation. it is not clear that regulations push technology deployment rates higher. Automotive product development is complex and features require significant time to overcome deployment constraints.

1171569,Plug-in vehicles and carsharing: user preferences. energy consumption and potential for growth,2015,Stephen M Zoepf,,,,,,Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are seen as a key pathway to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in transportation. yet their sales are under 1% of new cars despite large incentives. Carsharing. a market where consumers rent vehicles for short durations. is a low-risk way for consumers to use Plug-In Electric Vehicles for their travel needs without a large financial commitment. However. deployment of PEVs in carsharing depends on three key factors: (1) consumer acceptance of PEVs for rental trips. (2) the ability of carsharing providers to manage technical limitations of PEVs. and (3) that real-world energy consumption of PEVs meets expectations. To explore the feasibility of PEV deployment in carsharing. this dissertation incorporates a Mixed-Integer Programming and simulation of the assignment of trips and vehicles. and a Hybrid Choice Model of carsharing user preferences. This dissertation's primary contributions consist of the combination of Hybrid Choice Models with a Structural Topic Model to incorporate respondent comments. a two-level representation of the assignment problem faced by carsharing providers in allocating trips to vehicles and locating vehicles. a case study of PEV deployment in Boston. and analysis of real-world energy consumption of two fleets of PEVs. Results suggest that a large fraction of round-trip carsharing fleets could be converted to PEVs. simultaneously increasing profitability and reducing gasoline consumption. and some benefits can be captured using simple heuristics.

Electric vehicles (EV's) can facilitate such a transition. while also reducing local pollution and noise in dense urban environments. However. the technical constraints of energy storage and recharging create a need to better understand how consumers use their vehicles and exactly how these vehicles consume energy. BMW has conducted two extensive field trials as part of the development of its production electric vehicle. the i3. In particular the data analysis is used to better understand the challenges in estimating an EV's Distance to Empty (DTE). which is defined as the actual distance the vehicle can be driven before recharging is required.

DTE is estimated using an algorithm and displayed in real-time on the vehicle’s dashboard. The maximum DTE for electric vehicles (EV) is typically~ 100 to 400 km less than gasoline vehicles and a full recharge usually takes hours instead of minutes [1]. Also. the energy consumption of EVs is more influenced by auxiliary loads (eg heating). For these reasons it is important to provide an accurate DTE estimate. Recent studies have shown that current DTE algorithms are insufficient and often cause “range anxiety” among drivers [2][3].

Further. the diffusion of more fuel efficient vehicles. optimal for the long run. is less likely to succeed. illustrating the existence of trade-offs between the goals of the early stage transition. and those of the long-run equilibrium.

Vehicles and fueling infrastructure are complementarities and their chicken-egg dynamics are fundamental to the emergence of a self-sustaining alternative fuel vehicle market. but they are not well understood. The paper explores in-depth the dynamics resulting from local demand-supply interactions with strategically locating fuel-station entrants. The dynamics of vehicle and fuel infrastructure are examined under heterogeneous socio-economic/demographic conditions. The research reveals the formation of urban adoption clusters as an important mechanism for early market formation. However. while locally speeding diffusion. these same micro-mechanisms can obstruct the emergence of a large. self-sustaining market. Other feedbacks that significantly influence dynamics. such as endogenous topping-off behavior. are discussed.

1171590,Parameter estimation through maximum likelihood and bootstrapping methods,2015,Jeroen Struben and John Sterman and David Keith,,Analytical methods for dynamic modelers,,3-38,MIT Press,Estimating model parameters. and the uncertainty in these estimates. has long been central to good dynamic modeling practice (Oliva 2003). Modelers use a range of techniques to do so. ranging from formal statistical parameter estimation to expert judgment (Barlas 1989. 1996; Croson et al. 2014; Dogan 2007; Forrester and Senge 1978; Sterman 1989. 2000). The goal is to bring the widest range of relevant information to bear on the difficult problem of parameter estimation. With the advent of “big data.” the data required for formal statistical estimation of model parameters are increasingly available. making formal estimation both more feasible and more important. Robust parameter and confidence interval estimation in dynamic models is critical. first. in the use of models and data to discriminate among competing hypotheses. and second. to provide decision makers with models that are rigorously grounded in data and for which important uncertainties are quantified.Models must be grounded in data if modelers are to provide reliable advice to policymakers. The ability of a model to replicate the history of the relevant system provides one important test of a model’s fidelity and utility. 1 Ideally. as discussed by Homer (2012). Oliva (2003) and Graham (1980). one should estimate model parameters using data below the level of aggregation of the model; that is. data that are independent of the model behavior. For example. a fishery model should use data derived from biological studies for maturation times and mortality rates; a model of workforce skill development should use independent data on how long it takes a new hire to master a skill.

1171592,Understanding spatiotemporal patterns of hybrid-electric vehicle adoption in the United States,2012,David Keith and John Sterman and Jeroen Struben,,,12-4164,,,Over 2 million hybrid-electric vehicles have been sold in the United States since their introduction over a decade ago. Diffusion is not uniform: sales are clustered in particular regions such as the West Coast. around Washington DC and north into New York and New England. Several theories seek to explain spatial clustering in social networks. including demographic homophily. social contagion and confounding factors such as marketing exposure. Here the authors explore the extent to which each of these theories explains the observed clusters in adoption patterns. They develop a formal model of spatial technology diffusion capturing the flow of information among regions through people’s social networks. The model is applied to the case of the diffusion of the Toyota Prius hybrid-electric vehicle in the United States. The authors discuss applications of the findings. including implications for the development of effective public policies for government agencies. effective marketing and distribution strategy for auto original equipment manufacturers. and implications for the emerging market for electric vehicles and electric vehicle recharging infrastructure.,True,iBjWvmUAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,11,https://trid.trb.org/view/1130715,2799483747920715873,/scholar?cites=2799483747920715873,,,0,0,0

Ltd,Constraints on production capacity adjustment present a strategic and operational problem for managers launching products when demand is uncertain. Stock‐outs can be costly if demand exceeds available product supply. as sales are deferred or lost when prospective customers are waitlisted. Recent research on diffusion under supply constraints has analyzed launch strategies to minimize the chance of stock‐outs. Others suggest that waitlisted buyers generate social exposure that can boost customer demand and shape the diffusion process. We develop a generalized model of new product diffusion under supply constraints that explicitly accounts for endogenous customer waitlisting and waitlist‐generated word‐of‐mouth.

1171594,Space matters too! Mutualistic dynamics between hydrogen fuel cell vehicle demand and fueling infrastructure,2005,Jeroen Struben,,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference of the System Dynamics Society,,,,Pressures from human induced climate-change. pollution. and fossil fuel scarcity stimulate interest in alternative fuel vehicles. and in particular hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV’s). The transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to HFCV’s is complex as various ‘chicken-egg’mechanisms interact in a highly integrated fashion. and the mechanisms are highly non-linear. This paper focuses on one of the most critical chicken-egg problems: the mutualistic dynamics of HFCV adoption and its fueling infrastructure. The effects of local demand-supply interactions on these dynamics are explored in depth.This paper develops a dynamic. behavioral model of vehicle adoption and fueling infrastructure with explicit spatial structure. Simulations are performed for a reduced version. First. basic behavior is analyzed and shown to be robust. Further. a homogeneous market with strategically locating fuel-station entrants yields fast transition through the formation of adoption clusters (niches). However. under heterogeneous conditions the same micro-mechanisms can obstruct the emergence of a sustainable market. Policy implications are significant. This spatial behavioral dynamic model (SBDM) can be used to compare targeted entrance strategies for hydrogen fuel supply. Insights can be used for an aggregate HFCV transition model that includes other mechanisms. Finally. the paper should stimulate a discussion on merits and limitations of spatial modeling as applied to more general socio-economic issues.,True,iBjWvmUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,9,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.332.1429&rep=rep1&type=pdf,14892567511625374588,/scholar?cites=14892567511625374588,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.332.1429&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

However. relatively little is known about how and under what conditions actors overcome collective action problems to successfully form new markets. Using the benefits of simulation methods. we uncover how collective action problems result from actor resource allocation decisions interacting with each other and how the severity of these problems depends on central market- and actor-related characteristics. Specifically. we show that collective action problems occur when actors undervalue the benefits of market-oriented resource allocation and when actors contribute resources that are imperfectly substitutable. Furthermore. we show that collective action problems occur when actors are embedded in networks with others sharing a similar role in market formation.

We redress this gap by examining the central mechanisms governing the existence and resolution of collective action dilemmas in market formation. We use a computational model that centers on actors’ collective development of a market infrastructure to explore the impact of different degrees of collaboration on market formation. In particular. consistent with market settings where actors tend to perform entirely distinct roles. we allow actors’ resource contributions to be imperfectly substitutable. We find that while heterogeneity in growth strategies strongly reduces market emergence thresholds under perfect substitution. this effect is strongly suppressed under imperfect substitutability. Most important. our analyses point to a market emergence conundrum: market success depends mostly on collaboration precisely where the foundation for its existence is lowest. We develop a set of propositions and a grounded typology of ideal typical instances of market formation.

Altering this pathway requires a combination of technical. organisational. economic. institutional. social-cultural and political efforts that are increasingly referred to as socio-technical transitions to an environmentally sustainable economy (Van den Bergh. Truffer. and Kallis 2011). Transitions research has developed frameworks and methods (eg Geels. Berkhout. and van Vuuren 2016; Papachristos 2018a) 1 for understanding historical and contemporary transitions and for exploring system interventions related to governance and sustainability transitions (Smith. Voß. and Grin 2010). While qualitative. narrative-based case studies dominated early research. modelling and simulation approaches have recently gained ground. These latter approaches are particularly suited to explore interdependencies across different system elements (Bergman et al. 2008; Papachristos 2011. 2014a; Holtz et al. 2015; Walrave and Raven 2016; Köhler et al. 2018) and to perform counter-factual analysis (Sterman 2002) that allows posing ‘what-if’questions and avoiding potential selection biases that limit the power of pure empirical analysis. In this chapter we discuss how system dynamics (SD) modelling and simulation (Forrester 1958; Sterman 2000) can contribute to and complement–rather than substitute for–other methods in transitions research.

Yet. there are many examples of alliance failures. Scholars have studied this phenomenon and identified many reasons for alliance failure. including lack of trust between the partnering firms. Paradoxically. the concept of trust is still not fully understood. specifically how and under what conditions trust comes to break down within the broader process of alliance building. We synthesize a process model that describes the “alliance capability”. including trust. openness. partner contributions. and relational rents. We then translate this framework into a formal simulation model and analyze it thoroughly. In analyzing trust dynamics we identify and explore a tipping boundary. separating a regime of alliance failures and successes. We apply our core findings to openness strategies–decisions about how much knowledge to share with partners. Our analyses reveal that strategies informed by a static mental model of trust. contributions. and openness. under undervalue openness.

1171602,The diffusion of complex market technologies: From stylized facts to multiple mechanisms,2008,Jeroen Struben,,Industry Studies,,,,This paper develops initial steps towards a framework for studying the rich diffusion dynamics of complex market technologies. Dynamics of such technologies are conditioned by coevolutionary processes including the development of the installed base. consumer behavior. technologies. complementarities and interlinked supply chains. In this paper we analyze diffusion patterns. including failures and successes. of alternative transportation fuel (ATF) introductions. In addition a behavioral dynamic model is employed to characterize the underlying mechanisms driving their diffusion dynamics. We describe the diffusion of technologies as a process of market formation which requires overcoming a period of fragility. This period is defined during which at least one of the mechanisms works against their further spreading. Overcoming this stage is harder and takes longer with increasing market complexity and is further strongly influenced by institutional and historical contexts. From empirical analysis of ATFs we learn that overcoming such a fragile state is possible. but requires long periods of endured and coordinated efforts across multiple types of decision makers. During this stage. the market developments are highly path dependent. More generally. a process based diffusion framework requires capturing the fundamental mechanisms that typically cut across interorganizational fields-decisions and actions from consumers. organizations. various industries and policymakers. and that include the important system-physiological aspects.

Formalizing this framework into a computational model at the community level. and simulating distinct scenarios we demonstrate ineffectiveness of social-and commercial-oriented actions that promote changes in the food market when pursued in isolation.

We examine how policies and other decisions. made by various types of actors (ie consumers. industry. agriculture. government.

The transformation of such a dynamically complex socio-economic-system. characterized by multiple feedbacks and long-term delays. and involving disjointed public and private level interactions. produces counterintuitive behaviour.

In particular. electric drivetrain vehicles (EDVs) offer potential to develop a more sustainable transportation system. However most efforts to supplant the current transportation system. dominated by the petroleum-powered internal combustion engine have failed or had limited success. The diffusion of EDVs is complex. being both enabled and constrained by powerful positive feedbacks arising from scale and scope economies. experience curves. network effects and complementary assets. These positive feedbacks link automakers and their supply chains. fuel suppliers and their supply chains. consumer purchase and driving behavior. and public policy at multiple levels. While such feedbacks are sometimes discussed. dominant mental models among both policy makers and academics may underestimate the strength of these feedbacks and the fact that they also operate to advantage the current dominant technology. The result has been a series of overly-optimistic forecasts for the extent and speed of diffusion for AFVs and EDVs. and insufficient investment in standards and policies to help such vehicles over the tipping point to self-sustained adoption. For example. it is widely believed that higher gasoline prices (either through market forces or carbon policy) will push EDVs over the tipping point to self-sustained adoption and significantly speed the transition.

However. current frameworks fail at adapting to changes which happen in dynamically shifting environments and keep organizations blind to new possible threats. These threats may occur because of different changes happening internally or externally of the organization.

Fine,,Production and Operations Management,,,,Automated vehicles (AVs) have emerged rapidly in recent years. becoming a focus of high expectations and heated debates. Advocates argue that the arrival of AVs will make driving safer. greener. cheaper. and faster. bringing ubiquitous access to transportation while significantly reducing traffic congestion and environmental impacts. Skeptics. in contrast. suggest that the appeal of AVs will induce additional driving. offsetting or even overwhelming the positive effects of increased automation. Many analysts now believe that the solution lies in ensuring that most vehicle trips are shared to serve the same number of passenger miles with fewer vehicle miles. reducing traffic congestion.

1171616,Managing operational capabilities in startup companies,2017,Sergey A Naumov,,,,,,Hundreds of papers exist on entrepreneurial marketing and finance. whereas capabilities for operations get far less attention. Furthermore. much of the literature in operations management addresses challenges of companies in stable environments. leaving entrepreneurs with little theoretical or practical guidance on operations strategy. As a result. many entrepreneurs focus their efforts on value creation: marketing. product development. lead generation. and conversion. Ironically. extreme focus on value creation might represent a trap. whereby a company fails not because of a poor value proposition or bad marketing. but because of an inability to scale up and deliver value for perhaps an outstanding. innovative new product or service. In over a dozen case studies written during the past four years. we have found numerous examples where the development of operational capabilities was a determining factor for success or failure in entrepreneurial firms. We study the effect of timing of introduction of operational capabilities on market success as a function of firm's value proposition. We provide case evidence on the challenges and opportunities of building operations capabilities in entrepreneurial firms and we construct theoretical and testable models for assessing when and why entrepreneurs should invest sooner. or later. in operational capabilities.,True,4ojXzZwAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/109651,,,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/109651/987003583-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

1171618,Analysis of Dynamic Models by Optimization (ADMO),,Erling Moxnes and Sergey Naumov,,,,,,In management and politics. good policymaking relies on a proper understanding of the underlying system. Hence. analysts must be able to give understandable and correct explanations of how policies work using the most appropriate models of the system. Often. such models are non-linear and dynamically complex. Since such models are hard to understand. analysts can benefit from formal tools for policy analysis. In recent years. several methods have been developed and tested. notably loop eigenvalue elasticity analysis (LEEA)(Güneralp 2006; Saleh et al. 2010; Naumov and Oliva 2018) and pathway participation metrics (PPM)(Mojtahedzadeh 2008). These methods analyze model structure and identify the feedback loops that are generating the observed behavior of the model over time. The methods have been tested extensively on different models in the past few years.However. not all questions that policy makers find important can be answered through the lens of dominant dynamic structures. For example. consider a flow that is influenced by two stocks. one that is actively changing through a feedback loop. but is small. and another that is not changing. but is much larger. Then the loop dominance methods would prioritize the loop that contains the first stock. while the actual effect of that loop on the flow might be smaller than that of the second stock. Therefore. we need a tool that can explain phenomena of interest in terms of all elements of model structure. even if they are not changing dynamically.,True,4ojXzZwAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://proceedings.systemdynamics.org/2018/proceed/papers/P2154.pdf,,,,https://proceedings.systemdynamics.org/2018/proceed/papers/P2154.pdf,0,0,0

1171631,Capability traps and self-confirming attribution errors in the dynamics of process improvement,2002,Nelson P Repenning and John D Sterman,47,Administrative Science Quarterly,2,265-295,SAGE Publications,To better understand the factors that support or inhibit internally focused change. we conducted an inductive study of one firm's attempt to improve two of its core business processes. Our data suggest that the critical determinants of success in efforts to learn and improve are the interactions between managers' attributions about the cause of poor organizational performance and the physical structure of the workplace. particularly delays between investing in improvement and recognizing the rewards. Building on this observation. we propose a dynamic model capturing the mutual evolution of those attributions. managers' and workers' actions. and the production technology. We use the model to show how managers' beliefs about those who work for them. workers' beliefs about those who manage them. and the physical structure of the environment can coevolve to yield an organization characterized by conflict …,True,YlOW4Z4AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,597,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3094806,9823079049057430396,/scholar?cites=9823079049057430396,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/1815/4372-02.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0
1171632,Unanticipated side effects of successful quality programs: Exploring a paradox of organizational improvement,1997,John D Sterman and Nelson P Repenning and Fred Kofman,43,Management science,4,503-521,INFORMS,Recent evidence suggests the connection between quality improvement and financial results may be weak. Consider the case of Analog Devices. Inc.. a leading manufacturer of integrated circuits. Analog's TQM program was a dramatic success. Yield doubled. cycle time was cut in half. and product defects fell by a factor of ten. However. financial performance worsened. To explore the apparent paradox we develop a detailed simulation model of Analog. including operations. financial and cost accounting. product development. human resources. the competitive environment. and the financial markets. We used econometric estimation. interviews. observation. and archival data to specify and estimate the model. We find that improvement programs like TQM can present firms with a tradeoff between short and long run effects. In the long run TQM can increase productivity. raise quality. and lower costs.

The American Customer Satisfaction Index for services fell in 2000 to 69.4%. down 5 percentage points from 1994. We hypothesize that the characteristics of services—inseparability. intangibility. and labor intensity—interact with management practices to bias service providers toward reducing the level of service they deliver. often locking entire industries into a vicious cycle of eroding service standards. To explore this proposition we develop a formal model that integrates the structural elements of service delivery. We use econometric estimation. interviews. observations. and archival data to calibrate the model for a consumer-lending service center in a major bank in the United Kingdom.

Surveys show most Americans believe climate change poses serious risks but also that reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sufficient to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations can be deferred until there is greater evidence that climate change is harmful. US policymakers likewise argue it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce emissions. Such wait-and-see policies erroneously presume climate change can be reversed quickly should harm become evident. underestimating substantial delays in the climate’s response to anthropogenic forcing.

1171638,System Dynamics: systems thinking and modeling for a complex world,2002,John Sterman,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Engineering Systems Division,Todays problems often arise as unintended consequences of yesterdays solutions. Social systems often suffer from policy resistance. the tendency for well-intentioned interventions to be defeated by the response of the system to the intervention itself. The field of system dynamics. created at MIT in the 1950s by Jay Forrester. is designed to help us learn about the structure and dynamics of the complex systems in which we are embedded. design high-leverage policies for sustained improvement. and catalyze successful implementation and change. Drawing on engineering control theory and the modern theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. system dynamics often involves the development of formal models and management flight simulators to capture complex dynamics. and to create an environment for learning and policy design. Unlike pure engineering problems if any exist. human systems present unique challenges. including long time horizons. issues that cross disciplinary boundaries. the need to develop reliable models of human behavior. and the great difficulty of experimental testing. Successful change in social systems also requires the active participation of a wide range of people in the modeling and policy design process. people who often lack technical training.

Yet in that time. computer models have been used to analyze everything from inventory management in corporations to the performance of national economies. from the optimal distribution of fire stations in New York City to the interplay of global population. resources. food. and pollution. Certain computer models. such as The Limits to Growth (Meadows et al. 1972). have been front page news.

1171641,Appropriate summary statistics for evaluating the historical fit of system dynamics models,1984,John D Sterman,10,Dynamica,2,51-66,,System Dynamics modelers are often faulted for their reluctance to employ formal measures of goodness-of-fit when assessing the historical behavior of models. As a result. the validity of system dynamics models is often questioned even when the model's correspondence to historical behavior is quite good. This paper argues that the failure to present formal analysis of historical behavior creates an impression of sloppiness and unprofessionalism. After reviewing the concept of validity in simulation modeling. the paper proposes a simple set of summary statistics appropriate for system dynamics models (the root-mean-square error and Theil inequality statistics). The statistics allow the error due to individual behavior modes to be analyzed. do not require the use of formal parameter estimation procedures. and can be conveniently computed.

Like any stock. atmospheric CO2 rises when the inflow to the tub (emissions) exceeds the outflow (net removal). is unchanging when inflow equals outflow. and falls when outflow exceeds inflow. Participants were informed that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are now roughly double net removal. so the tub is filling.Yet. 84% drew patterns that violated the principles of accumulation. If emissions followed the path in the typical example shown. atmospheric CO2 would continue to rise. Nearly two-thirds of the participants asserted that atmospheric GHGs can stabilize even though emissions continuously exceed removal—analogous to arguing a bathtub continuously filled faster than it drains will never overflow. Most believe that stopping the growth of emissions stops the growth of GHG concentrations. The erroneous belief that stabilizing emissions would quickly stabilize the climate supports wait-and-see policies but violates basic laws of physics. Training in science does not prevent these errors. Three-fifths of the participants have degrees in science. technology. engineering. or mathematics (STEM); most others were trained in economics. Over 30% hold a prior graduate degree. 70% of these in STEM.

Effective decision making in such systems requires an understanding of the relationship between stocks and the flows that alter them. However. highly educated people are often unable to infer the behavior of simple stock–flow systems.

Persistent poor performance is not attributable to an inability to interpret graphs. lack of contextual knowledge. motivation. or cognitive capacity.

1171645,The effects of driving style and vehicle performance on the real-world fuel consumption of US light-duty vehicles,2010,Irene Michelle Berry,,,,,,Even with advances in vehicle technology. both conservation and methods for reducing the fuel consumption of existing vehicles are needed to decrease the petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the U.S. light-duty vehicle fleet. One way to do this is through changes in driving style. specifically through reductions in driving aggressiveness. The role of vehicle performance is particularly interesting because of the recognized tradeoff between vehicle performance and certified fuel consumption and because more powerful vehicles are capable of more aggressive driving. This thesis analyzes the effects of driving style and vehicle performance on the real-world fuel consumption of conventional vehicles though two parts. First. vehicle simulations assess the sensitivity of fuel consumption to a wide range of driving patterns. From these results. three aggressiveness factors were developed for quantifying driving aggressiveness. Each aggressiveness factor. although based only on the speed trace and vehicle characteristics. is proportional to fuel consumption in one of three specific speed ranges: neighborhood. city. or highway speeds. These aggressiveness factors provide a tool for comparing drive cycles and evaluating the real-world driving patterns. Second. driving data from two U.S. sources was used to 1) provide illustrative examples of real world driving and 2) assess the relationship between driving aggressiveness and vehicle performance. The distribution of aggressiveness among the driving data follows a lognormal shape. The average aggressiveness is either below or near the aggressiveness of the U.S. drive cycles …,True,VZEG9isAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,201,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/58392,11854218245991360918,/scholar?cites=11854218245991360918,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/58392/649054011-MIT.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

The approach is based on a comparison of temporal consumption patterns of like loads. where the likeness is determined by considering loads that are similar in temporal consumption behavior. The algorithm measures the degree to which electric loads shift their consumption relative to the changing energy price embedded in the time of use (TOU) rates. This method can be used to model available load flexibility as a virtual energy storage system. The measured difference is packaged into duration curves of flexibility which efficiently capture load–specific properties of flexibility such as time–limited ability to hold energy. The algorithm was reduced into the analysis code and applied to the real-world AMI data.

We compare the impact of the provincial targets approach to a single target for China that achieves the same reduction in CO2 emissions intensity at the national level. The national target assumes trading of emissions allowances across provinces. resulting in the least-cost reductions nationwide. We find that the national target results in about 20% lower welfare loss in China relative to the provincial targets approach.

However. the integration of wind energy into China’s coal-heavy electricity system presents significant challenges owing to wind’s variability and the grid’s system-wide inflexibilities. Here we develop a model to predict how much wind energy can be generated and integrated into China’s electricity mix. and estimate a potential production of 2.6 petawatt-hours (PWh) per year in 2030. Although this represents 26% of total projected electricity demand. it is only 10% of the total estimated physical potential of wind resources in the country. Increasing the operational flexibility of China’s coal fleet would allow wind to deliver nearly three-quarters of China’s target of producing 20% of primary energy from non-fossil sources by 2030.,True,dJSe9EUAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC,102,https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy201686,17215469834181249909,/scholar?cites=17215469834181249909,,,0,0,0

Using a model that resolves the US economy by region. income category. and sector-specific technology deployment opportunities. this paper studies the magnitude and distribution of economic impacts under regulatory versus market-based approaches. We quantify heterogeneity in the national response to regulatory policies. including a fuel economy standard and a clean or renewable electricity standard. and compare these to a cap-and-trade system targeting carbon dioxide or all greenhouse gases. We find that the regulatory policies substantially exceed the cost of a cap-and-trade system at the national level.

This apparent paradox has inspired the writing of this book Agricultural Biotechnology in China: Origins and Prospects. Against the backdrop of ongoing global controversy over the safety and benefits of transgenic crops. this book focuses on two key questions: 1) What historical as well as recent economic. political and social developments account for China’s sizeable investment in research on transgenic crops and the apparent mismatch between laboratory and commercial activity?; and 2) What are the chances that transgenic crops will be introduced on a large scale in China. and if so. what are the potential benefits. drawbacks. and constraints associated with widespread adoption? These questions are particularly timely as China’s regulators may soon approve transgenic rice for commercial planting. making it the first food crop to be grown on a large scale in China. China’s investment in transgenic crops is driven as much by a broader science and technology development agenda as by the needs of its agricultural sector. Therefore.

The results indicate that there is a U-shaped relation between income and atmospheric concentration of SO2 and an inverted U-shaped relation between the spatial intensity of economic activity and SO2 concentrations. These results suggest that the spatial intensity of economic activity. rather than income. provides the impetus for policies and technologies that reduce SO2 emissions. Based on this result. the atmospheric concentration of SO2 in developing nations may decline faster than indicated by previous analyses. The potential for this decline depends on the rate at which income grows relative to population. The trade-off between the effects of income gains and the spatial intensity of economic activity on the atmospheric concentration of SO2 is consistent with the notion …,True,a6didmUAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,494,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180099700181X,1110726149499114551,/scholar?cites=1110726149499114551,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46305699/The_determinants_of_atmospheric_SO2_conc20160607-12722-1tbodsw.pdf,0,0,0

We find that the firms size measure. i.e. total assets. have the same heavy tail characteristics as various studies have shown. e.g. for US and Italian firms.

To receive customers. production companies must often promise short lead-times and the option of adjustable order quantities and delivery dates. Coping with uncertainty and variable demand is a challenging task. With the additional challenge of cutting down the production costs to be able to provide inexpensive products. proper planning and scheduling of the production becomes very difficult and crucial for success. It is therefore of crucial importance to develop systematic methods to address the problem of planning and scheduling under uncertainty in order to create efficient and reliable plans and thereby reduce the risk of delayed deliveries of customer orders.

However. the cost of lithium-ion batteries limits their penetration in the public market. Energy input is a significant cost driver for lithium batteries due to both the electrical and thermal energy required in the production process. The drying process requires 45–57% of the energy consumption of the production process according to a model presented in this paper. The model is used as a base for quantifying the energy and temperatures at each step. as replacing electric energy with thermal energy is considered. In Iceland. it is possible to use geothermal steam as a thermal resource in the drying process.

Approximation algorithms for this NP-hard problem are called on-line if the items are packed sequentially into bins with the bin receiving a given item being independent of the number and sizes of all items as yet unpacked. Off-line algorithms plan packings assuming full (advance) knowledge of all item sizes. The closed on-line algorithms are intermediate: item sizes are not known in advance but the number n of items is. The uniform model. where the n item sizes are independent uniform random draws from [0. 1]. commands special attention in the average-case analysis of bin packing algorithms. In this model. the expected wasted space produced by an optimal off-line algorithm is Θ (√ n). while that produced by an optimal on-line algorithm is Θ (√ n log n)-Surprisingly. an optimal closed on-line algorithm also wastes only s Θ (√ n) space on the average.

On one hand. analytic and simulations research has largely relied on assumptions of geometric path loss and isotropic transmission which have not been borne out in experiments. Experimental research. on the other hand. has not adopted theoretical models and instead focused on measuring the reality on the ground. We propose a new framework for wireless algorithms. First. distance-based path loss is replaced by an arbitrary gain matrix. typically obtained by measurements of received signal strength (RSS). This allows for the modeling of complex environments. eg. with obstacles and walls. Second. a new parameter ζ indicates how close the gain matrix is to a distance metric. effectively measuring the complexity of the environment. We experimentally validate our framework on two indoors testbeds with 20 and 60 motes. The results validate the basic properties of the model. the predictive ability of packet reception. dominance over distance-based models. and the sensitivity of ζ to the nature of the environment. Theoretically. we show that all known SINR scheduling algorithms that work in general metric spaces carry over and achieve equivalent performance guarantees in the new model.

1171802,Gas anxiety and the charging choices of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle drivers,2018,Yanbo Ge and Don MacKenzie and David R Keith,64,Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment,,111-121,Pergamon,Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) can provide many of the benefits of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). such as reduced petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. without the “range anxiety” that can accompany driving a vehicle with limited range when there are few charging opportunities. However. evidence indicates that PHEVs are often plugged in more frequently than BEVs in practice. This is somewhat paradoxical: drivers for whom plugging in is optional tend to do so more frequently than those for whom it is necessary.

1171804,Dynamic discrete choice modeling of the charging choices of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle drivers,2017,Yanbo Ge and Don MacKenzie,,,17-06510,,,Combining an internal combustion engine. an electric powertrain and onboard charging equipment. plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are supposed to be less dependent on public charging opportunities than battery electric vehicles (BEVs). However evidence shows that PHEVs plug in more often because some owners have “gas anxiety”–a strong desire to avoid using gasoline. Prior research has provided empirical evidence of gas anxiety: PHEV owners who are earlier adopters and whose motivation of owning an EV is not primarily financial tend to value gasoline cost much more heavily than charging cost-the authors call this group of PHEV users as gas anxiety group. The goal of this study is to test the role of gas anxiety among PHEV owners on charging decision making using dynamic discrete choice model (DDCM) based on a new survey conducted in June-July 2016. The DDCM results are mostly consistent with the static latent class model result but offer better goodness of fit. The new model again shows PHEV users who are earlier adopters and whose motivation of owning an EV is not primarily financial tend to value gasoline cost more heavily than charging cost at public charging stations. but the proportion of gas anxiety group is smaller than sample collected in 2013. This shows that with the market moving forward. the proportion of those with gas anxiety might decrease and the future public chargers might need to be priced competitively with the gasoline on per mile basis to encourage the usage of public charging.,True,gXG3LZ4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,5,https://trid.trb.org/view/1439599,18154669380674450793,/scholar?cites=18154669380674450793,,,0,0,0

In order to find out what factors influence the jobs-housing balance and how to improve the job accessibility in Chinese megacities where the Danwei system has been phasing out and the economy has become market-oriented. this empirical study examines the case of Beijing. The result of analysis shows that accessibility to transport infrastructure has no influence on the individual’s workplace choice. and more job opportunities in the dwelling place. lower income level lead to more residents choosing to work in the dwelling place. It is also shown that the co-location hypothesis is not supported in Beijing: low-income workers in the periphery cannot reduce travel time and cost by changing their workplace or residence because of the deficiency of job opportunities in the peripheral area and because the price of public transport is low. Finally it is concluded the jobs-housing balance along the rail transit corridor will increase job accessibility and reduce car dependence.,True,gXG3LZ4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4,https://trid.trb.org/view/1289938,10396716267481416821,/scholar?cites=10396716267481416821,,,0,0,0
1171806,Modeling Vehicle Choices and Charging Behavior of Plug-In Electric Vehicle Owners Jointly Using Dynamic Discrete Choice Model,2018,Yanbo Ge and Don MacKenzie,,,18-05951,,,Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) owners’ decisions on which vehicle to use for a travel day can be influenced by the expectation of the charging opportunities during the day. and the charging decision at one stop can be influenced by the characteristics of future charging opportunities. The models of previous studies usually treat vehicle choices (which car to drive for the travel day) and charging choices of PEV owners as isolated decisions. which could cause underestimation of the demand for public charging facilities. This paper applies the dynamic discrete choice model (DDCM) with a finite horizon to jointly analyze vehicle choices and charging choices of PEV owners in a travel day based on stated preference data. The combination of Nested Fixed Point Algorithm and finite mixture solution based on EM algorithm proposed by Arcidiacono and Jones is utilized to capture the heterogeneity of decision-making among PEV users. The final model groups the PEV users into two classes: 63% in class 1 and 37% in class 2. The respondents in class 1 tend to pay significantly more money to avoid being stranded and would try to avoid using Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) when the public charging supply is not sufficient. In this group. the Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) users tend to value the charging cost and gasoline cost similarly. The other group (class 2) of PEV users appears to be less cautious about being stranded and tends to use BEV more frequently for long distance trips than class 1. The PHEV owners in class 2 appear to try to avoid using gasoline because they value gasoline cost significantly more heavily than charging cost.,True,gXG3LZ4AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,2,https://trid.trb.org/view/1497045,456064484690307111,/scholar?cites=456064484690307111,,,0,0,0

1171811,Discrete Choice Modeling of Plug-in Electric Vehicle Use and Charging Behavior Using Stated Preference Data,2019,Yanbo Ge,,,,,,Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) have the potential of reducing gasoline consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. The net impacts of PEVs – including upstream emissions from electricity generation and the impact these vehicles place on the electricity grid – depend on both the amount of travel conducted by PEV and locations that those PEVs are charged. This dissertation investigates the vehicle use choices and charging decisions of both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) for both home-based trip tours and long-distance trips using stated preference (SP) data. It presents a novel dynamic discrete choice modeling (DDCM) framework that explicitly accounts for the stochastic nature of the vehicle choice and charging decisions of PEV users: earlier choices on vehicle use and charging influence the utility of the future choices; the expectation of the future options influences those earlier decisions; and choices are made under uncertainty about actual energy consumption and availability of chargers. For home-based trip tours. my results show that BEV users are willing to pay $10-$24 to avoid having to deviate from the originally planned route. which indicates that “range anxiety” of BEV owners – the fear of being stranded in the middle of a trip – is not a crucial issue for home-based trips. Using charging infrastructure development to encourage BEV adoption might be more beneficial than reducing “range anxiety” among the current users. which could entail building charging stations at locations that have more public exposure. such as public parking garages in a city center …,True,gXG3LZ4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/43650,,,,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/43650/Ge_washington_0250E_19768.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
1171812,Calculated Choices or Quick Decisions? Modeling the Effect of Public Charging Opportunities on Plug-in Electric Vehicle Use and Charging Choices,2019,Yanbo Ge and Don MacKenzie,,,19-03239,,,The impact of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) on the electricity grid and gasoline displacement depends on the distance of the trips that is covered by electricity. It is therefore important to understand how PEV owners make decisions on which vehicles to use and when to charge. which can be influenced by multiple factors including the characteristics of the trips and charging opportunities. Complicating such analyses is the intertemporal dependence of choices: when using a PEV. decisions about charging depend on both prior choices and expectations about the future charging opportunities; and decisions on which vehicle to use depend on opportunities for charging. Based on the data from a stated preference survey among PEV owners. this paper compares two approaches to modeling PEV owners’ choices of vehicle choice for a home-based tour and charging choices at the subsequent stops: static discrete choice modeling which treats all choices as independent; and dynamic discrete choice modeling (DDCM) which explicitly accounts for the intertemporal payoffs associated with vehicle use and charging choices under uncertainty. The results indicate both models can help to understand how PEV users make decisions about which vehicle to use for a travel day and can inform charging demand forecasting of PEV users. The DDCM based on the intertemporal payoffs offers slightly better within-sample predictions. However. this improved predictive power comes at the cost of considerably higher computational time and a much more involved process for model development and estimation that may be substantially less accessible to many …,True,gXG3LZ4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://trid.trb.org/view/1573155,,,,,0,0,0
1171813,The role of gas anxiety in the charging choices of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle drivers,2016,Yanbo Ge and Don MacKenzie and David Keith,,,,,Transportation Research Board,Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) provide an opportunity to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions without causing range anxiety. As a result. PHEV drivers are commonly assumed to be less dependent on the availability of charging infrastructure than battery electric vehicle (BEV) drivers. However there is also evidence that PHEVs plug in more often than BEVs because the owners have gas anxiety - a strong desire to avoid using gasoline. This work examines the existence of gas anxiety by analyzing the factors influencing charging decision of PHEV owners. A web-based stated preference survey was conducted and the data was analyzed using a latent class logit model. The result shows that there are two classes of decision making patterns among PHEV owners: those who value gasoline cost and recharging expenditure almost the same (class 1) and those who value gasoline cost more heavily than recharging cost (class 2). Among those in class 2. the amount of money spent on gasoline has much bigger influence on the utility of charging than the amount spent on electricity at the recharging station. which can be interpreted as a form of gas anxiety.,True,gXG3LZ4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/120865,,,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/120865/Ge-MacKenzie-Keith16-6283_6359_111620150121168674754615.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0
1171814,Motorization and Commuting Mode Choice around Metro Stations in Shanghai Central and Suburban Areas,,Haixiao Pan and Yanbo Ge and Qing Shen and Peng Chen,,,,,,Chinese cities have been witnessing dramatic changes of urbanization and motorization. which brings concerns about congestion. energy overconsumption and air pollution. Rail transit (or MRT) is considered as an effective option to counter or delay motorization. With the extension of urban rail transit from city center to suburban areas. the built environment. transport infrastructure services and travel demand vary greatly. The way how rail transits influence motorization and travel behavior in the central and suburban areas is different. Then policies and planning strategies to reduce car dependency should change accordingly. Based on a household travel survey. we compared the factors influencing car ownership and commuting mode choice of residents with proximity to metro stations in Shanghai central and suburban areas. We found for residents in suburban areas. denser road network at the residential area. more mixed land use and denser road network at workplaces can help to delay car purchasing and reduce car commuting. In the city center however. the built environment characteristics are as significant. The variable. defined as a ratio of access time to station divided by the total travel time by MRT. shows significant influence on residents’ decision of rail commuting in both central and suburban areas. Therefore. improvement of access connection to metro stations is an important strategy to attract more passengers. We also found that people’s attitude towards MRT have a great impact on motorization and the mode choice of metro. _______________________________________________________ Haixiao Pan,True,gXG3LZ4AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,http://web.mit.edu/cron/project/CUPUM2015/proceedings/Content/modeling/247_pan_h.pdf,,,,http://web.mit.edu/cron/project/CUPUM2015/proceedings/Content/modeling/247_pan_h.pdf,0,0,0

Some have intense distress about the incongruence between their natal sex and gender identity and expect that clinicians will provide them with hormones and gender reassignment (GR) surgery as quickly as possible. Others feel only some unease with or confusion about their gender identity and try to find ways to live with these feelings. The gender dysphoria may have started long before puberty or be recent. It might have been a response to certain experiences or have been present without a clear starting point. There are also huge differences between adolescents in their ability to handle the complexities and adversities that often accompany gender variance.

What should be emphasized is that these studies did not use the fairly strict criteria of the DSM-5. and children could receive the diagnosis based only on gender-variant behavior. With DSM-5 criteria. the persistence rate probably would have been higher. The design in nearly all follow-up studies was to have a first assessment in childhood (before puberty) and a second one in adolescence or young adulthood. The conclusion seemed to be that children with GD are"" persisters""(children who remain gender dysphoric in adolescence and seek treatment) or"" desisters""(children for whom the GD feelings desisted in adolescence and who do not reapply for treatment). and that the outcome becomes clear in the early stages of puberty. 2 If one considers retrospective accounts of adult applicants for treatment. many have claimed that they experienced GD in childhood. 3 Because in most countries treatment for adolescents was not available until very recently. this could be an important practical reason why treatment in these cases was not pursued until adulthood. The question arises as to whether these adults with childhood GD would have sought treatment with puberty blockers as young adolescents 4 had it been available. or whether there is a developmental route that is different from the often-described"" desistence"" and"" persistence.""

Flanders (Belgium) and the United Kingdom regarding the proposed changes and the clinical applicability and utility of the ICD-11 criteria of ‘Gender Incongruence of Adolescence and Adulthood’ (GIAA). A total of 628 participants were included in the study: 284 from the Netherlands (45.2%). 8 from Flanders (Belgium) (1.3%). and 336 (53.5%) from the UK. Most participants were transgender people (or their partners/relatives) (n = 522). 89 participants were healthcare providers (HCPs) and 17 were both healthcare providers and (partners/relatives of) transgender people. Participants completed an online survey developed for this study. Most participants were in favor of the proposed diagnostic term of ‘Gender Incongruence’ and thought that this was an improvement on the ICD-10 diagnostic term of ‘Transsexualism’. Placement in a separate chapter dealing with Sexual- and Gender-related Health or as a Z-code was preferred by many and only a small number of participants stated that this diagnosis should be excluded from the ICD-11.

Ltd.,For 50 years the term ‘gene’ has been synonymous with regions of the genome encoding mRNAs that are translated into protein. However. recent genome‐wide studies have shown that the human genome is pervasively transcribed and produces many thousands of regulatory non‐protein‐coding RNAs (ncRNAs). including microRNAs. small interfering RNAs. PIWI‐interacting RNAs and various classes of long ncRNAs. It is now clear that these RNAs fulfil critical roles as transcriptional and post‐transcriptional regulators and as guides of chromatin‐modifying complexes.

In this article. we systematically analyzed the conservation of several groups of functional ncRNAs. including miRNAs. snoRNAs and longer ncRNAs whose function has been either documented or confidently predicted. As expected. miRNAs and snoRNAs were highly conserved. By contrast. the longer functional non-micro. non-sno ncRNAs were much less conserved with many displaying rapid sequence evolution.

Until recently. discrimination between these two categories was relatively straightforward: most transcripts were clearly identifiable as protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs). and readily distinguished from the small number of well-characterized non-protein–coding RNAs (ncRNAs). such as transfer. ribosomal. and spliceosomal RNAs. Recent genome-wide studies have revealed the existence of thousands of noncoding transcripts. whose function and significance are unclear. The discovery of this hidden transcriptome and the implicit challenge it presents to our understanding of the expression and regulation of genetic information has made the need to distinguish between mRNAs and ncRNAs both more pressing and more complicated. In this Review. we consider the diverse strategies employed to discriminate between protein-coding and noncoding transcripts and the fundamental difficulties that are inherent in what may superficially appear to be a simple problem. Misannotations can also run in both directions: some ncRNAs may actually encode peptides. and some of those currently thought to do so may not. Moreover. recent studies have shown that some RNAs can function both as mRNAs and intrinsically as functional ncRNAs. which may be a relatively widespread phenomenon. We conclude that it is difficult to annotate an RNA unequivocally as protein-coding or noncoding. with overlapping protein-coding and noncoding transcripts further confounding this distinction.

Although much recent attention has focused on tiny 22- to 25-nucleotide microRNAs. several functional ncRNAs are orders of magnitude larger in size. Examples of such macro ncRNAs include Xist and Air. which in mouse are 18 and 108 kilobases (Kb). respectively. We surveyed the 102.801 FANTOM3 mouse cDNA clones and found that Air and Xist were present not as single. full-length transcripts but as a cluster of multiple. shorter cDNAs. which were unspliced. had little coding potential. and were most likely primed from internal adenine-rich regions within longer parental transcripts. We therefore conducted a genome-wide search for regional clusters of such cDNAs to find novel macro ncRNA candidates. Sixty-six regions were identified. each of which mapped outside known protein-coding loci and which had a mean length of 92 Kb. We detected several known long ncRNAs within these regions. supporting the basic rationale of our approach. In silico analysis showed that many regions had evidence of imprinting and/or antisense transcription. These regions were significantly associated with microRNAs and transcripts from the central nervous system. We selected eight novel regions for experimental validation by northern blot and RT-PCR and found that the majority represent previously unrecognized noncoding transcripts that are at least 10 Kb in size and predominantly localized in the nucleus. Taken together. the data not only identify multiple new ncRNAs but also suggest the existence of many more macro ncRNAs like Xist and Air.,True,x4XfFJcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,180,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020037,4303359286592613902,/scholar?cites=4303359286592613902,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020037,0,0,0

The relative importance of these factors in deciding the hierarchy of TCD8+ responses and how they are influenced by the immunoproteasome are not well understood. Using an influenza infection model in mice deficient in various immunoproteasome subunits. we observe that Ag presentation and TCD8+ repertoire are altered in an epitope-specific and immunoproteasome subunit-dependent manner. More importantly. we find that the level of Ag presentation and the extent of the underlying repertoire can work either alone or in concert to determine definitively the magnitude of the individual TCD8+ responses and hence the overall TCD8+ hierarchy.

Currently. most in vitro culture systems for the production of these DCs include serum. However. this is undesirable because serum contains growth factors that vary between individuals and could affect DC development. Unless the patient's own serum is used. foreign antigens and the risk of infection will detract from the usefulness of these cells in clinical strategies. In this study we investigated the production of DCs from CD34+ progenitor cells of cancer patients or normal donors under serum-free conditions. We have established a model system for the investigation of DC development and maturation. Dendritic cells that developed from myeloid precursors accumulated after 2 weeks in an intermediate CD1a. CD80-. CD83-. CD86-stage. Intermediate DCs adhered to plastic surfaces. expressed Birbeck granules. and were negative for CD2 and CD14. In the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. interleukin-4 promoted the development of these stages. Spontaneous maturation of intermediate DCs into fully activated DCs expressing CD83 and costimulatory molecules occurred asynchronously over the ensuing 2 to 3 weeks. This maturation involved increased expression of CD80. CD83. CD86. CMRF-44. HLA-A.-B.-C. and-DR as well as downregulation of CD1a and CD11b.

Can we make sense of the variety of decisions we can observe now in different industries or different parts of the world? What are the skills that companies must retain? In this paper we address the challenge of making these choices rationally.

Cambridge. MA,Despite the popularity of flexible manufacturing systems. managers suffer from inadequate frameworks to help incorporate flexibility into their strategic planning. To address some of these issues. 31 printed circuit board plants belonging to 14 electronic firms in the US. Japan. and Europe were studied. The research has implications for plant automation. worker participation. relationships with suppliers. wage schemes. and component reusability. The study found significant relationships among different types of flexibilility and discovered that increased flexibility in certain areas has no adverse quality and cost effects.

The model enables straightforward representation of the inter-relations among multiple objectives and analysis of tradeoffs among those that exhibit conflicts. The model is demonstrated through a discussion of integrality versus modularity in product and supply chain designs that is motivated by events that took place in the automotive industry over the last decade.

With their constantly shifting technologies. processes and organizational structures. these companies provide useful lessons in how value chains can be managed to respond rapidly to ever changing strategic challenges. These New Economy players. however. are not the only ones facing dramatic and sweeping changes throughout their value chains. All companies in all industries are operating on ever faster evolutionary tracks and at ever greater risk. Every industry has its own clockspeed1—or rate of evolution—depending on its products. processes and customer requirements. Individual capabilities can lose value overnight. hastened by rapidly changing technologies. abrupt shifts in the larger economy or by the new tactics of competitors. The faster the industry clockspeed. the shorter the half-life of any given competitive advantage. A company’s real core capability—perhaps its only sustainable one—is its ability to design and redesign its value chain in order to continually find sources of maximum. albeit temporary. advantage. Understanding and redesigning a company’s value chain begins with a map. one that identifies the organizations involved. the subsystems they create. the capabilities they bring to the value proposition. and the technological contribution each makes to the company’s products and services.

The extension captures the idea that operators of a production process may be able to discover and eliminate defects in the system if. during an inspection. they find the process to be “out of control.” Thus. the distinguishing feature of the model is that one inspects the process not only for the purpose of repairing the machine. but also in the hope that the machine will be caught in the act of producing defective output. so that a source of problems is uncovered and eliminated.

1171884,Flexibility and performance: a literature critique and strategic framework,1991,Freddy F Suárez and Michael A Cusumano and Charles H Fine,,,,,Sloan School of Management. Massachusetts Institute of Technology,I. INTRODUCTION Much has been written about flexibility in recent years as this has become of critical concern to managers. academic researchers. and policy makers concerned with the evolution of production and design technology as well as firm and industry competitiveness. Yet there is little agreement on how to define flexibility. how to achieve flexibility. or what the costs and benefits of more or less flexibility actually are. if any. For example. some researchers have viewed flexibility primarily in terms of programmable machines and capabilities for mixing models in production (Jaikumar 1986. Fine and Pappu 1988). Others have viewed this in terms of the versatility of people and skills (Piore and Sabel 1984). Some researchers have discussed flexibility as a strategic variable that has to be consistent with the overall competitive strategy of a firm. but do not provide a conceptual framework for defining flexibility types and lin king these with strategic options. Overall. the literatureon the topic is fragmented and does not provide answers to basic questions that managers need to address: Under which conditions would a firm be likely to need a given typeof flexibility? How can firms implement different kinds of flexibility? What is the impact of different kinds of flexibility on productivity. quality and competitive position? This article attempts to answer these and other questions by providing a framework to analyze flexibility in terms of the strategic objectives of a firm as well as its impact on business performance. The central argument is that flexibility comes in various forms. each of which can be implemented in different ways and with different costs. but …,True,2AuKwb4AAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC,121,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2359/SWP-3298-24063228.pdf,4836357373164318796,/scholar?cites=4836357373164318796,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2359/SWP-3298-24063228.pdf,0,0,0

1171892,Quality control and learning in productive systems,1983,Charles H Fine,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"The traditional view of quality is that it is costly--higher quality requires higher units costs. A recent. renewed interest in quality has led to another point of view. namely. that producing high quality products reduces unit costs. This point of view directly challenges the traditional assumed relationship between quality and cost. If valid. the"" quality is free"" hypothesis has significant implications for quality management. Specifically. if producing high quality output aids in cost reduction. then firms that ignore such an effect will suboptimize on their quality levels. The work in this paper links the previously disjoint literatures of quality control and learning curves in an attempt to explain why high quality and low costs need not be inconsistent. Toward this end. we introduce the idea of a quality-based learning curve. When costs are affected by a quality-based learning curve. product quality influences the rate of cost reduction due to experience or learning. More specifically. costs decline more rapidly with the experience of producing high quality products than with the experience of producing low quality products. We first provide a formulation of an economic conformance level model based on an exposition by Juran. This formulation serves as the base-case optimal quality control model. Next. we review briefly the formulation and some results of Spences's learning curve optimization model. His model solves for the optimal production paths when unit costs decline as a function of cumulative volume.These two models are knit together into the quality-based learning model.

There is a suggestion that this will present a range of different sustainable outcomes. Life Cycle Assessment is commonly used to assess the impact of mobility products. such as cars. as a function of distance. However. it is unclear how this approach applies to different servitization models with varying occupancy levels.This paper assesses the effect of different occupancy rates on life cycle impact of current mobility services: taxi and carpooling compared to the vehicle ownership model using two functional units: vehicle kilometre and passenger kilometre.

1171898,The environmental impacts of recycling portable lithium-ion batteries,2016,Anna Boyden and Vi Kie Soo and Matthew Doolan,48,Procedia Cirp,,188-193,Elsevier,Waste from electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE) is one of the fastest growing waste streams. with its volume expected to increase by a third from 2013 to 2017. Lithium-ion batteries are the most common battery type used in portable electronic devices and their use is expected to double from 2013-14 to 2019-20. The recycling of lithium-ion batteries reduces energy consumption. reduces greenhouse gas emissions. and results in considerable natural resource savings when compared to landfill. However. it is unclear which recycling processes have the least impact on the environment. This paper will investigate the different processes that are currently used for recycling portable lithium-ion batteries. such as hydrometallurgy. pyrometallurgy. and combinations of processes.

1171915,Using system dynamics to inform scenario planning: a case study,2013,Charles R Featherston and Matthew Doolan,,,,,The Systems Dynamics Society,Developing strategy and policy requires some understanding of both the present and the future. but operational environmental change can makes these two vastly different. Defining that which is predetermined and that which is not about the future can provide clarity and decrease the space along which the present system might evolve into its future state. Scenario planning is an approach for exploring these different possible futures. The development of scenarios is about surfacing mental models. testing them. and learning. However. the literature on scenario planning offers little in the way of guidance about how this can be done. System dynamics offers a formal process for surfacing. testing and informing mental models. This paper presents and investigates the use of system dynamics to inform scenario planning. It did this by applying the two approaches to a not-forprofit organisation. While scenarios and a dynamic model were developed. the effectiveness of this application of the approaches is questionable.

Singapore,The exponential growth of e-waste contributes to a rapid increase in the amount of e-waste contaminants in landfills. In this study. the waste produced from the recycling of mobile phones will be quantified. highlighting the driving factors that affect the amount of waste reaching landfills. A system dynamics approach was adopted to understand the flow of mobile phone e-waste in an e-waste recycling facility in Malaysia. The analysis found that the efficiency of mobile phone PCBs’ precious metals recovery is 13.62%.

While ultrasonic C-scan testing has become a mainstay of quality control programs. it is not suitable for inspection of every weld in a high volume production due to the considerable operator skill required. and the requirement to take parts off-line for inspection. The dynamic resistance curve of a weld is known to contain information about the development of a weld. however there is not always a clear way to relate that directly back to the quality of a weld and exactly how a system may have arrived at that decision. Because the dynamic resistance data is available inline for every weld. developing a method of determining weld quality from the dynamic resistance would allow for process faults to be diagnosed sooner than would be possible with periodic off-line inspection.In …,True,w4INCC8AAAAJ:a3BOlSfXSfwC,12,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705817315382,10855338024534517038,/scholar?cites=10855338024534517038,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705817315382/pdf?md5=b063514aa8b2b62b3acf9bbe56a4b4f0&pid=1-s2.0-S1877705817315382-main.pdf,0,0,0

Manuf. Sci. Eng.,2,363-368,,Force Signature analysis is now becoming a widely used process monitoring tool in stamping operations. Typically this has focussed on the statistical deviation of the force trace from the average curve in order to monitor the condition of the panel during runs 1. Other more modern methods of signature analysis look at frequencies within the force signal generated. These methods tend to be used where there is a vibration to be measured. which affects the quality of the process. such as milling 2. However. the vibrations measured in the force signature during the stamping process are not related to the quality of the work piece and these methods are not relevant to this application.

Although Al is one of the most recycled metal streams. the presence of impurities. such as iron. silicon and copper. has limited the environmental and economic benefits of recycling Al. These competing interests have led to the choice of recycling options that is suboptimal. This paper evaluates the economic and environmental effects of recycling different Al scrap qualities based on data collected from a Belgian recycling facility. Observations from the case study show that the profit-driven recycling market has led to a recycling system that does not produce the best environmental impact outcome. Maximising the environmental benefits of material recycling is often secondary to profit generation from the recyclers’ perspective. There is a need for stricter measures. such as environmental tax on primary Al production …,True,w4INCC8AAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC,10,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978919305591,6941085759397919524,/scholar?cites=6941085759397919524,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978919305591/pdf?md5=8544b40d28f522b30d4b773b2b26d5d6&pid=1-s2.0-S2351978919305591-main.pdf,0,0,0

The variations in the phase content are accompanied by changes in the degree of crystallinity and the microstructure. all of them influencing the macroscopic piezoelectric and ferroelectric response of the material. This work shows how the piezo-and ferroelectric behaviour of PVDF depends on the aforementioned parameters and. in particular. on the crystalline β-phase content.

It is possible to obtain films in the β phase by solution but this material presents a high porosity leading to an opaque appearance and a decrease of the mechanical and electrical properties. In this work. porous films in the β phase were obtained directly from the solution at 60 °C.

Dielectric constant increases significantly with increasing filler content and decreasing filler size. Space charge effects at the interface between BaTiO3 and PVDF strongly influence the dielectric response. The electroactive β-phase of PVDF is nucleated by the presence of the ceramic filler. the effect being strongly dependent on filler size and independent on filler content. This filler/matrix interaction is also responsible for the variations observed in the activation energy of the thermal degradation of the polymer. Smaller particles lead to larger relative contact areas and are responsible for the main variations observed in the thermal. mechanical. and electrical properties of the composites.,True,e3kh8yEAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,178,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-011-5916-7,8179509795274770486,/scholar?cites=8179509795274770486,,,0,0,0

After the formation of a thin silica layer in aqueous solution. the particles can be transferred into ethanol for further growth using the Stöber method. The thickness of the silica layer can be completely controlled. and (after surface modification) the particles can be transferred into practically any solvent.

Shell deposition depends on control of the double layer potential. and requires priming of the core particle surface. Chemical reactions are possible within the core. via diffusion of reactants through the shell layer. Quantum dots can be stabilized against photochemical degradation through silica deposition. whilst retaining strong fluorescence quantum yields and their size dependent optical properties.

Although initially these quantum dots display photoluminescence with very low quantum yields. upon prolonged illumination with visible light. enhancements up to 5000% have been measured. This leads to aqueous quantum dots with high luminescence. which can have important implications in biological and other applications. A distinct correlation between the photocorrosion process and the photoactivation process is observed. The primary reason for luminescence enhancement is considered to be the smoothing of the CdSe core surface. Importantly. even stronger activation was observed in silica- and CdS-coated nanocolloids where the CdSe core was expected to be shielded from photocorrosion.

The thermal heating experiments show structural changes that occur on timescales ranging from hours to days. At the highest temperature examined (250 °C) the nanorods are transformed into spheres within an hour. On the other hand. no structural changes are observed in the laser-induced heating experiments up to temperatures of 700 ± 50 °C. This is attributed to thermal diffusion in the laser experiments. Measurements of the period of the extensional mode of the nanorods using time-resolved spectroscopy show a significant softening at high pump laser powers.

Isopropanol (IPA) availability during the anisotropic etching of silicon in Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) solutions was investigated. Squares of 8 to 40 µm were patterned to (100) oriented silicon wafers through DWL (Direct Writing Laser) photolithography. The wet etching process was performed inside an open HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) flask with ultrasonic agitation. IPA volume and evaporation was studied in a dynamic etching process. and subsequent influence on the silicon etching was inspected. For the tested conditions. evaporation rates for water vapor and IPA were determined as approximately 0.0417 mL/min and 0.175 mL/min. respectively. Results demonstrate that IPA availability. and not concentration. plays an important role in the definition of the final structure.

Thus. the development of rapid. efficient. and competitive diagnostic techniques is essential. This work reports a study of the deformability and velocity assessment of healthy and artificially impaired red blood cells (RBCs). with the purpose of potentially mimicking malaria effects. in narrow polydimethylsiloxane microchannels. To obtain impaired RBCs. their properties were modified by adding. to the RBCs. different concentrations of glucose. glutaraldehyde. or diamide. in order to increase the cells’ rigidity. The effects of the RBCs’ artificial stiffening were evaluated by combining image analysis techniques with microchannels with a contraction width of 8 µm. making it possible to measure the cells’ deformability and velocity of both healthy and modified RBCs. The results showed that healthy RBCs naturally deform when they cross the contractions and rapidly recover their original shape. In contrast. for the modified samples with high concentration of chemicals. the same did not occur. Additionally. for all the tested modification methods. the results have shown a decrease in the RBCs’ deformability and velocity as the cells’ rigidity increases. when compared to the behavior of healthy RBCs samples. These results show the ability of the image analysis tools combined with microchannel contractions to obtain crucial information on the pathological blood phenomena in microcirculation.

Its tunable characteristics enable the measurement of different biochemical substances with the same device. It is composed of two parallel thin silver mirrors with a beta-PVDF (poly(vinylidene fluoride) in its beta phase) film in-between as the resonance cavity. The filter is tuned by adjusting the space between the mirrors through an electric voltage inducing dipolar orientation in the beta-PVDF film. Once the thickness changes of the beta-PVDF film is due to variations at a molecular level. the changes are rather homogeneous within the samples. As a result. this approach achieves parallelism between the two mirrors. which is a complex problem to solve in conventional Fabry-Perot optical filters.

The effects of the degree of sintering (particle–particle contact angle) and of additional porosity created by pore-former particles on coordination numbers and percolation probabilities are addressed by using both the extended percolation theory and the drop-and-roll numerical reconstruction method.

1172123,Effective transport properties in random packings of spheres and agglomerates,2013,Antonio Bertei and Benedetta Nucci and Cristiano Nicolella,32,,,1531-1536,,A modelling framework for the prediction of effective properties in random packings of particles is presented. Random packings of spheres and agglomerates of spheres are numerically generated by using packing algorithms. Effective properties of both the types of packings are evaluated through a Monte-Carlo random-walk (aka mean square displacement) method. which allows the calculation of both geometrical parameters (eg. pore size distribution. specific surface area) and transport properties (eg. effective gas diffusivity. permeability). The results are reported as a function of porosity in dimensionless form. in order to obtain scale-independent information. The effective properties obtained for random packings of spheres are compared with independent experimental data showing a satisfactory agreement. Effective properties of packings of agglomerates are also evaluated. showing that particle agglomeration significantly increases the mean pore size while reducing the effective gas diffusivity and the specific surface area. The results show that agglomerates can not be generally assimilated to spheres with an equivalent diameter. The modelling approach presented in this study may improve the quantitative characterization of porous media composed by aggregates of particles.,True,Xjm9V7oAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,29,https://arpi.unipi.it/handle/11568/244946,9223992356846624685,/scholar?cites=9223992356846624685,,https://arpi.unipi.it/bitstream/11568/244946/2/2013_ChemEngTrans_32_pp_1531-1535.pdf,0,0,0

The acid-based catalyzed transesterification system was used to produce castor biodiesel and the highest yield of 82.5% was obtained under the optimized condition. The FTIR spectrum of castor biodiesel indicates the presence of C=O and C–O functional groups. which is due to the ester compound in biodiesel. The smoke emission test revealed that B40 (biodiesel blend with 40% biodiesel and 60% diesel) had the least black smoke compared to the conventional diesel. Diesel engine performance test indicated that the specific fuel consumption of biodiesel blend was increased sufficiently when the blending ratio was optimized. Thus. the reduction in exhaust emissions and reduction in brake-specific fuel consumption made the blends of caster seed oil (B20) a suitable alternative fuel for diesel and could help in controlling air pollution.,True,NtiKbAUAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,42,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jchem/2014/451526/abs/,18077491767308105871,/scholar?cites=18077491767308105871,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jchem/2014/451526/abs/,0,0,0

Sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production is one of the major criteria to ensure the process of renewability. Chicken fat is an encouraging feedstock for biodiesel. In this study. waste chicken fat was converted to biodiesel via catalysed transesterification. Optimised process parameters were recorded at 1: 4 oil-to-methanol volume ratio and 0.5 wt% KOH catalyst concentration with a biodiesel yield of 96%. The FT-IR spectral analysis of chicken fat and chicken fat biodiesel confirmed the conversion of chicken fats into biodiesel. The physico-chemical properties of biodiesel were tested in accordance with ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards. The specific fuel properties of chicken fat biodiesel that include calorific value. viscosity and acid value were found to be lower than that of petrodiesel. The diesel engine performance tests confirmed that the biodiesel blends performance was similar to petrodiesel.

The system was analyzed by setting up the kinetic. potential. and dissipation energy equations. and the excitation was assumed as a random vibration on the base of the fluid film bearing of the rotor. Lagrangian was used to derive the equations of motion in the Y and Z directions and the Simulink under Matlab software was used to simulate the current system. The simulation was carried out under a constant rotational speed and different masses for the shaft and the disk. In addition. the effect of changing the stiffness and the damping coefficients is also investigated. The responses of the two coordinates (Z and Y) were also observed as well as the whirl orbits of the shaft for different mass ratios. Furthermore. the stability of the system was investigated mathematically. The results show that the whirl motion is stable when the rotor speed is 8.000 rpm. while the mass ratio of the disk and the shaft is 0.4.,True,OsPE-SMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,7,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hussien_Al-Wedyan/publication/228570774_The_behaviour_of_the_Jeffcott_rotor_under_a_vibrating_base_of_fluid_film_bearing/links/55d5ae0308ae9d659487a2b0/The-behaviour-of-the-Jeffcott-rotor-under-a-vibrating-base-of-fluid-film-bearing.pdf,3038560482634696377,/scholar?cites=3038560482634696377,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hussien_Al-Wedyan/publication/228570774_The_behaviour_of_the_Jeffcott_rotor_under_a_vibrating_base_of_fluid_film_bearing/links/55d5ae0308ae9d659487a2b0/The-behaviour-of-the-Jeffcott-rotor-under-a-vibrating-base-of-fluid-film-bearing.pdf,0,0,0

A hybrid shaft was fabricated using a wetted filament winding method by winding glass and carbon fibres onto aluminum tube with different winding angles. numbers of layers and stacking sequence. The torque-angle-of-twist response was obtained and the failure modes of the hybrid shaft were studied. The results show that the static torque capacity for a winding angle of 45o is larger than it is for 90o. for both glass and carbon fibres. For [+45/-45]3s laminates. the maximum static torsion for carbon fibres is approximately 36% higher than for the glass fibres. The aluminum tube yielded first at the central region of the shaft. followed by crack propagation in the composite shaft along the fibre direction. which eventually caused delamination of the composite layers from the aluminum tube.

For this purpose. two identical trial mix designs were proposed and undertake using two different cementitious materials. ie. fly ash (proven to be effective in RCC made) and Jordanian natural pozzolan. The two mixes used were designed and laboratory trialed on the basis of using 60 kg/m3 of cement for both mixes and with 80 kg/m3 of fly ash for the first mix and 80 kg/m3 of natural pozzolan for the second mix. Also. results for 60. 85. and 100 kg/m3 cement only with no fly ash and pozzolan trial mix were available. More than 100 cylindrical specimens with 150 mm diameter by 300 mm long were cast and tested from the undertaken mix program. Compressive strength and Split tensile strength were determined for the two mixes. Results from the two mixes were analyzed and studied. Correlations were made between the mechanical properties for the two proposed mixes and the mixture using only 60. 85 and 100 kg/m3 cement only.

Dynamic mechanical analysis was performed. to obtain the strain and creep compliance for kenaf composites at various styrene concentrations. It is possible to obtain creep curves at different temperature levels which can be shifted along the time axis to generate a single curve known as a master curve. This technique is known as the time–temperature superposition principle. Shift factors conformed to a William–Landel–Ferry (WLF) equation. However. more long term creep data was needed in order to further validate the applicability of time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP) to this material.

These analyses considered the actual thermal properties. actual climatic condition. and the actual placement schedule of RCC layers. Linear and nonlinear stress-strain analyses are considered in the structural analysis. The computer program ANSYS is used to simulate the construction process for the Mujib RCC dam. The numerically computed temperature obtained from ANSYS is compared with the actual temperature measured in the field using Distributed Fiber Optic Temperature Measurement (DFOT) and thermocouples installed within the body of the dam. The study demonstrated that the two dimensional FE analyses is adequate to predict the temperature distribution in the dam body. whereas the three dimensional model with nonlinear RCC properties showed better results for stresses that are produced in the dam body.,True,OsPE-SMAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdallah_Husein_Malkawi/publication/268591191_Temperature_Distribution_in_Al-Mujib_Roller_Compacted_Concrete_RCC_Gravity_Dam/links/5a901fc4a6fdccecff00ce8b/Temperature-Distribution-in-Al-Mujib-Roller-Compacted-Concrete-RCC-Gravity-Dam.pdf,12941522801917484526,/scholar?cites=12941522801917484526,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdallah_Husein_Malkawi/publication/268591191_Temperature_Distribution_in_Al-Mujib_Roller_Compacted_Concrete_RCC_Gravity_Dam/links/5a901fc4a6fdccecff00ce8b/Temperature-Distribution-in-Al-Mujib-Roller-Compacted-Concrete-RCC-Gravity-Dam.pdf,0,0,0

An innovative analytical model is proposed in order to carry out simulation studies on the whirling vibrations of the tool workpiece system in a deep hole boring process. At the interaction point of the boring bar-workpiece system there will be an additional displacement in addition to the torque transmitted. This displacement is of a dynamic origin and could be simulated as a wedge introduced between the cutting head-workpiece assemblies. An assumed mode method with the Lagrangian equations was used to derive the mathematical model of the system.,True,OsPE-SMAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,http://ijame.ump.edu.my/images/Volume_3/10%20Hussien%20and%20Mutasher.pdf,,,,http://ijame.ump.edu.my/images/Volume_3/10%20Hussien%20and%20Mutasher.pdf,0,0,0
