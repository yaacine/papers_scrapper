1281436,Automatic image segmentation of nuclear stained breast tissue sections using color active contour model and an improved watershed method,2013,Aymen Mouelhi and Mounir Sayadi and Farhat Fnaiech and Karima Mrad and Khaled Ben Romdhane,8,Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,5,421-436,Elsevier,Automatic image segmentation of immunohistologically stained breast tissue sections helps pathologists to discover the cancer disease earlier. The detection of the real number of cancer nuclei in the image is a very tedious and time consuming task. Segmentation of cancer nuclei. especially touching nuclei. presents many difficulties to separate them by traditional segmentation algorithms. This paper presents a new automatic scheme to perform both classification of breast stained nuclei and segmentation of touching nuclei in order to get the total number of cancer nuclei in each class. Firstly. a modified geometric active contour model is used for multiple contour detection of positive and negative nuclear staining in the microscopic image. Secondly. a touching nuclei method based on watershed algorithm and concave vertex graph is proposed to perform accurate quantification of the different stains.

In this paper. we propose a new method of text independent speaker recognition based on the use of the mean of the Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as a speaker model. These MFCC are extracted from the speaker phonemes in the pre-segmented speech sentences. A multi-layer neural network trained with the back propagation algorithm is proposed to classify these discriminative models. A study is carried out in order to view these models efficiency.

The originality of this work remains in using thresholding and clustering techniques together for color image segmentation. The histogram considers the occurrence of the gray levels among pixels. In a first stage. the thresholding histogram is used for finding all major homogenous areas. In order to reduce the computational burden required by the fuzzy C-means. the coarse-fine concept methodology is used. The thresholding technique is used for the coarsely segmentation.

Separation of touching cells presents many difficulties to the traditional segmentation algorithms. In this paper. we propose a new automatic method to segment clustered cancer cells.

The proposed method is composed essentially of two steps. First. mass distributions in Dempster-Shafer theory are obtained from the membership degrees of each pixel covering the three image components (R. G and B). Each membership’s degree is determined by applying Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering to the gray levels of the three images. Second. the fusion process consists in defining three discernment frames which are associated with the three images to be fused. and then combining them to form a new frame of discernment. The strategy used to define mass distributions in the combined framework is discussed in detail. The proposed fusion method is illustrated in the context of image segmentation. Experimental investigations and comparative studies with the other previous methods are carried out showing thus the robustness and superiority of the proposed method in terms of image segmentation.,True,xNjICT4AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,31,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.353.974&rep=rep1&type=pdf,5876755618879191019,/scholar?cites=5876755618879191019,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.353.974&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. the problem of textured image segmentation with an unsupervised method is addressed. To overcome the difficulty of the segmentation of images involving complex random texture patterns. we propose a cascade clustering method combining statistical features and the standard Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm. Instead of using the gray level value of a given pixel. a feature vector is extracted from a sliding window centered on the pixel. The Fuzzy C-means algorithm is used to cluster the obtained feature vectors into several classes corresponding to the different regions of the multi-textured image.

However. this estimation becomes more difficult when system failure times are neither identically nor independently distributed. This is due to the aging of repairable systems under imperfect maintenance.

A texture-based algorithm is introduced in this paper for fully automatic segmentation of choroidal images obtained from an EDI system of Heidelberg 3D OCT Spectralis. Dynamic programming is utilized to determine the location of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Bruch’s membrane (BM) (the blood-retina barrier which separates the RPE cells of the retina from the choroid) can be segmented by searching for the pixels with the biggest gradient value below the RPE. Furthermore. a novel method is proposed to segment the choroid-sclera interface (CSI). which employs the wavelet based features to construct a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The model is then used in a graph cut for segmentation of the choroidal boundary. The proposed algorithm is tested on 100 EDI OCTs and is compared with manual segmentation. The results showed an unsigned error of 2.48 ± 0.32 pixels for BM extraction and 9.79 ± 3.29 pixels for choroid detection.

The thickness map of central foveal area in layers 1. 3. and 4 displayed the minimum thickness. Maximum thickness was observed in nasal to the fovea of layer 1 and in a circular pattern in the parafoveal retinal area of layers 2. 3. and 4 and in central foveal area of layer 6. Temporal and inferior quadrants of the total retinal thickness and most of other quadrants of layer 1 were significantly greater in the men than in the women.

The method is comprised of two separate stages; the first step is 2-D segmentation of blood vessels in curvelet domain. enhanced by taking advantage of vessel information in crossing OCT slices (named feedback procedure). and improved by suppressing the false positives around the optic nerve head. The proposed method for vessel localization of OCT slices is also enhanced utilizing the fact that retinal nerve fiber layer becomes thicker in the presence of the blood vessels. The second stage of this method is axial localization of the vessels in OCT slices and 3-D reconstruction of the blood vessels.

We perform retrieval in a two-stage fashion: first rank by a secondary medium. and then perform CBIR only on the top-K items. Thus. effectiveness is improved by performing CBIR on a ‘better’ subset. Using a relatively ‘cheap’ first stage. efficiency is also improved via the fewer CBIR operations performed.

Additive random noise can easily be removed using simple threshold methods. De-noising of natural images corrupted by Gaussian noise using wavelet techniques are very effective because of its ability to capture the energy of a signal in few energy transform values.

1281482,An improved invisible watermarking technique for image authentication,2010,M Mohamed Sathik and SS Sujatha,24,International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology,,61-73,,Digital Watermarking is a technique which embeds a watermark signal into the host image in order to authenticate it. In our previous work [1]. a binary watermark pattern was constructed from the information content of the image by selecting the minimum value from every block of size 2x2. and was disordered with the help of Arnold Transform but which was not showing a fine robustness against compression and rotation operation. As a solution to this issue. an innovative watermarking scheme is proposed. According to this. the low frequency subband of wavelet domain and the rescaled version of original image are utilized in the watermark construction process. A scrambled version of watermark is obtained with the help of Arnold Transform. The operation of embedding and extraction of watermark is done in high frequency domain of Discrete Wavelet Transform since small modifications in this domain are not perceived by human eyes. This watermarking scheme deals with the extraction of the watermark information in the absence of original image. hence the blind scheme was obtained. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Similarity Ratio (SR) are computed to measure image quality. In addition. the competency of the proposed method is verified under common image processing operations and a comparative study is made against the previous technique.,True,wDSRC7MAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,57,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.359.8211&rep=rep1&type=pdf,17115553994305885092,/scholar?cites=17115553994305885092,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.359.8211&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1281483,A robust segmentation approach for noisy medical images using fuzzy clustering with spatial probability,2009,Zulaikha Beevi and Mohamed Sathik,29,methods,37,38,,Image segmentation plays a major role in medical imaging applications. During last decades. developing robust and efficient algorithms for medical image segmentation has been a demanding area of growing research interest. The renowned unsupervised clustering method. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm is extensively used in medical image segmentation. Despite its pervasive use. conventional FCM is highly sensitive to noise because it segments images on the basis of intensity values. In this paper. for the segmentation of noisy medical images. an effective approach is presented. The proposed approach utilizes histogram based Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm for the segmentation of medical images. To improve the robustness against noise. the spatial probability of the neighboring pixels is integrated in the objective function of FCM. The noisy medical images are denoised. with the help of an effective denoising algorithm. prior to segmentation. to increase further the approach’s robustness. A comparative analysis is done between the conventional FCM and the proposed approach. The results obtained from the experimentation show that the proposed approach attains reliable segmentation accuracy despite of noise levels. From the experimental results. it is also clear that the proposed approach is more efficient and robust against noise when compared to that of the FCM.,True,wDSRC7MAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,57,"https://www.ccis2k.org/iajit/PDF/vol.9,no.1/2747-10.pdf",8477200481912628920,/scholar?cites=8477200481912628920,,,"https://www.ccis2k.org/iajit/PDF/vol.9,no.1/2747-10.pdf",0,0,0

1281485,Image de-noising and enhancement using multiwavelet with hard threshold in digital mammographic images,2011,Kother Mohideen and Arumuga Perumal and Mohamed Sathik,,,,,,Breast cancer continues to be a significant public health problem in the world. The diagnosing mammography method is the most effective technology for early detection of the breast cancer. However. in some cases. it is difficult for radiologists to detect the typical diagnostic signs. such as masses and microcalcifications on the mammograms. Dense region in digital mammographic images are usually noisy and have low contrast. And their visual screening is difficult to view for physicians. This paper describes a new multiwavelet method for noise suppression and enhancement in digital mammographic images. Initially the image is pre-processed to improve its local contrast and discriminations of subtle details. Image suppression and edge enhancement are performed based on the multiwavelet transform. At each resolution. coefficient associated with the noise is modelled and generalized by laplacian random variables. Multiwavelet can satisfy both symmetry and asymmetry which are very important characteristics in Digital image processing. The better denoising result depends on the degree of the noise. generally its energy distributed over low frequency band while both its noise and details are distributed over high frequency band and also applied hard threshold in different scale of frequency sub-bands to limit the image. This paper is proposed to indicate the suitability of different wavelets and multiwavelet on the neighbourhood in the performance of image denoising algorithms in terms of PSNR..

Such anomalous values give useful information to the data analyst in discovering useful patterns. Through isolation. these data may be separated and analyzed. The analysis of outliers and influential points is an important step of the regression diagnostics. In this paper. our aim is to detect the points which are very different from the others points. They do not seem to belong to a particular population and behave differently. If these influential points are to be removed it will lead to a different model. Distinction between these points is not always obvious and clear. Hence several indicators are used for identifying and analyzing outliers. Existing methods of outlier detection are based on manual inspection of graphically represented data. In this paper. we present a new approach in automating the process of detecting and isolating outliers.

In this method. we use the Improved Harris corner detect theory for maintaining the distance vector between the seed pixel and maintain minimum distance between the seed pixels.

Research on region growing. however. has focused primarily on the design of feature measures and on growing and merging criteria. Most of these methods have an inherent dependence on the order in which the points and regions are examined. This weakness implies that a desired segmented result is sensitive to the selection of the initial growing points.

1281523,Symmetric region growing,2000,Shu-Yen Wan and William E Higgins,2,,,96-99,IEEE,The goal of image segmentation is to partition a digital image into disjoint regions of interest. Of the many proposed image segmentation methods. region growing has been one of the most popular. Research on region growing. however. has focused primarily on the design of feature measures and on growing and merging criteria. Most of these methods have an inherent dependence on the order in which the points and regions are examined. This weakness implies that a desired segmented result is sensitive to the selection of the initial growing points. We define a set of theoretical criteria for a subclass of region-growing algorithms that are insensitive to the selection of the initial growing points. This class of algorithms. referred to as symmetric region growing (SymRG). leads to a single-pass region-growing approach applicable to any dimensionality of images. Furthermore. they lead to region-growing algorithms …,True,k96cdv0AAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC,28,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/899236/,5492622553793695369,/scholar?cites=5492622553793695369,,,,0,0,0

This technique relies upon the adhesion of ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) to targeted molecular markers of disease. This is accomplished by coating the surface of the contrast agent with a ligand that specifically binds to the intended molecular marker. Most UCA particles remain in the blood space. and their retention is influenced by the forces imposed by blood flow. For a UCA bound to a molecular target on the vascular endothelium. blood flow imposes a dislodging force that counteracts retention. Additionally. contrast agent adhesion to the molecular marker requires rapid binding kinetics. especially in rapid blood flow. The ability of a ligand:target bond complex to mediate fast adhesion and withstand dislodging force is necessary for efficient ultrasound-based molecular imaging.

With such compositions. it is very common to see politicians depicted side-by-side with criminals during election campaigns. or even Hollywood superstars relationships being wrecked by allegedly affairs depicted in gossip magazines. Thinking about this problem. in this paper we analyze telltales obtained from highlights in the eyes of every person standing in a picture in order to decide whether or not those people were really together at the moment of such image acquisition. We validate our approach with a data set containing realistic photographic compositions. as well as authentic unchanged pictures.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Dynamic cardiac imaging in MRI is a very challenging task. To obtain high spatial resolution. temporal resolution. and signalto‐noise ratio (SNR). single‐shot imaging is not sufficient Use of multishot techniques resolves this problem but can cause motion artifacts because of data inconsistencies between views. Motion artifacts can be reduced by signal averaging at some cost in increased scan time. However. for the same increase in scan time. other techniques can be more effective than simple averaging in reducing the artifacts. If most of the energy of the inconsistencies is limited to a certain region of k‐space. increased sampling density (oversampling) in this region can be especially effective in reducing motion artifacts. In this work. several variable‐density spiral trajectories are designed and tested. Their efficiencies for artifact reduction are evaluated in computer simulations and in scans of normal volunteers …,True,LSl5wvcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,130,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.1910370416,36010084603740595,/scholar?cites=36010084603740595,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45789346/mrm.191037041620160519-12307-fzwkhy.pdf,0,0,0

To create a fast K-means algorithm for this study. first a level histogram of statistics for the image database is made. The level histogram is used with the K-means algorithm for clustering data. A fast K-means algorithm not only shortens the length of time spent on training the image database cluster centers. but it also overcomes the cluster center re-training problem since large numbers of images are continuously added into the database. For the experiment. we use gray and color image database sets for performance comparisons and analyzes. respectively.

Presently. there are few stable biomarkers available on a neuroanatomical level for distinguishing between these two diseases. However. few investigations have directly compared the changes in brain volume and assessed the compensatory effects of a change in the parts of the brain associated with PD and with ET. To determine the compensatory and/or degenerative anatomical changes in the brains of PD and ET patients. the present study tested. via two VBM approaches (Basic vs. Dartel VBM processing). the anatomical brain images of 10 PD and 10 ET patients. as well as of 13 age-matched normal controls. obtained through a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. These findings indicate that PD and ET caused specific patterns of brain volume alterations in the brains examined. In addition. our observations also revealed compensatory effects. or self-reorganization. occurring in the thalamus and the MTG in the PD and ET patients. due perhaps in part to the enhanced thalamocortical sensorimotor interaction and the head-eye position readjustment. respectively. in these PD and ET patients.

A simple and effective way is to directly interpolate the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients around the peak of the magnitude spectrum. In this paper. we use theoretical analysis to show that correcting a phase term on the DFT coefficients before interpolation can reduce the estimation bias and improve the accuracy of the estimation significantly. We derive the amount of bias reduction that can be achieved by the phase correction. We then show that the phase correction can be considered as a pre-estimation correction while the effect of the previously proposed post-estimation correction is also to reduce the bias caused by the phase. In the experiments. we find that the phase correction proposed here and the post-estimation correction previously proposed is effective in different regions of frequency offset …,True,LSl5wvcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,35,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168413002119,995969200874228976,/scholar?cites=995969200874228976,,,,0,0,0

LDs affect about 10 percent of all children enrolled in schools. The problems of children with specific learning disabilities have been a cause of concern to parents and teachers for some time. Decision trees and clustering are powerful and popular tools used for classification and prediction in Data mining. Different rules extracted from the decision tree are used for prediction of learning disabilities. Clustering is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets. called clusters. which are useful in finding the different signs and symptoms (attributes) present in the LD affected child. In this paper. J48 algorithm is used for constructing the decision tree and K-means algorithm is used for creating the clusters. By applying these classification techniques.

The results were used to study the relationship between ERH and AST. Corn with 16% mechanical damage had lower ERH than corn with 2% mechanical damage. but corn with greater mechanical damage had shorter AST.

Many automatic threshold selection methods such as Otsu method provide satisfactory results for thresholding images with obvious bimodal gray level distribution. However. most threshold selection methods fail if the histogram is unimodal or close to unimodal. Valley-emphasis method partially resolves such problem by weighting the objective function of the Otsu method with the valley point in the histogram.

This is of interest in the area of diagnostics for eye diseases that affect the blood vessels in the eye. In a departure from other state-of-the-art methods. vessels are first pre-grouped together with graph partitioning. using a spectral clustering technique based on morphological features. Local curvature is estimated over the whole image using eigenvalues of Hessian matrix in order to enhance the vessels. which appear as ridges in images of the retina. The result is combined with a binarized image. obtained using a threshold that maximizes entropy. to extract the retinal vessels from the background. Speckle type noise is reduced by applying a connectivity constraint on the extracted curvature based enhanced image. This constraint is varied over the image according to each region's predominant blood vessel size. The resultant image exhibits the central light reflex of retinal arteries and veins. which prevents the segmentation of whole vessels. To address this. the earlier entropy-based binarization technique is repeated on the original image. but crucially. with a different threshold to incorporate the central reflex vessels. The final segmentation is achieved by combining the segmented vessels with and without central light reflex.

The Yellow River was once the world’s largest carrier of fluvial sediment. but its sediment load has decreased by approximately 90% over the past 60 years 3. The decline in sediment load is due to changes in water discharge and sediment concentration. which are both influenced by regional climate change and human activities. Here we use an attribution approach to analyse 60 years of runoff and sediment load observations from the traverse of the Yellow River over China’s Loess Plateau—the source of nearly 90% of its sediment load. We find that landscape engineering. terracing and the construction of check dams and reservoirs were the primary factors driving reduction in sediment load from the 1970s to 1990s. but large-scale vegetation restoration projects …,True,otKBemIAAAAJ:VnuxuLaQPLMC,517,https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2602,16324328662234429112,/scholar?cites=16324328662234429112,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yafeng_Wang/publication/285392602_Reduced_sediment_transport_in_the_Yellow_River_due_to_anthropogenic_changes/links/565fa49908aeafc2aaca952f.pdf,0,0,0

Since the 1970s. numerous soil- and water-conservation practices have been implemented: terracing. planting of vegetation. natural vegetation rehabilitation. and check-dam construction. With the implementation of the Grain-for-Green Project in 1999. the Loess Plateau has become the most successful ecological restoration zone in China. However. these large-scale restoration measures and drought have significantly reduced both runoff and sediment from the Loess Plateau.

1281654,Outdoor/indoor vision-based localization for blind pedestrian navigation assistance,2010,Sylvie Treuillet and Eric Royer,10,International journal of Image and Graphics,04,481-496,World Scientific Publishing Company,The most challenging issue facing the navigation assistive systems for the visually impaired is the instantaneous and accurate spatial localization of the user. Most of the previously proposed systems are based on global positioning system (GPS) sensors. However. the accuracy of low-cost versions is insufficient for pedestrian use. Furthermore. GPS-based systems are confined to outdoor navigation and experience severe signal losts in urban areas. This paper presents a new approach for localizing a person by using a single-body-mounted camera and computer vision techniques. Instantaneous accurate localization and heading estimates of the person are computed from images as the user progresses along a memorized path. A portable prototype has been tested for outdoor as well as indoor pedestrian use. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the vision-based localization: the accuracy is …,True,L7tQvtwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,34,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219467810003937,10070427943119449921,/scholar?cites=10070427943119449921,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00648507/file/IJIG-D-08-00049VF.pdf,0,0,0
1281655,3D modeling from uncalibrated color images for a complete wound assessment tool,2007,Benjamin Albouy and Yves Lucas and Sylvie Treuillet,,,,3323-3326,IEEE,This paper is concerned with the 3D modeling of skin wound using uncalibrated vision techniques for the volumetric assessment of the healing process. We have developed an original approach for matching two color images captured with a free-handled digital camera and generate a semi-dense 3D model. We evaluate the precision of the inferred 3D model by registration to a ground truth on artificial wounds. The method is then applied to volumetric measurements. The clinician requirements of a global 5% precision are overshot as 3% is obtained locally. The best configuration for taking photos lies between 1.2 and 1.5 for distance ratios and between 15deg and 30deg for vergence of the stereo pair.

Using techniques similar to those developed by Deriche. we derive a filter which maximizes the product of the first two criteria under the constraint of the last one. The result is an infinite length impulse response filter which leads to a stable third-order recursive implementation. Its performance shows an increase of the signal-to-noise ratio in the case of blurred and noisy images. compared to the results obtained from Deriche's filter.,True,wJ-MkNMAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC,70,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168402002839,2092881790321264844,/scholar?cites=2092881790321264844,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.701.2557&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The calculation of this parameter. based on the change in vessel cross-sectional area per unit change in blood pressure. requires precise delineation of the aortic wall on a series of cine-MR images. Firstly. the study consisted in validating a new automatic method to assess aortic elasticity. Secondly. aortic distensibility was studied for the ascending and descending thoracic aortas in 26 healthy subjects. Two homogeneous groups were available to evaluate the influence of sex and age (with an age limit value of 35 years). The automatic postprocessing method proved to be robust and reliable enough to automatically determine aortic distensibility. even on artefacted images.

1281658,A uml and colored petri nets integrated modeling and analysis approach using graph transformation,2010,Ouassila Labbani,9,Journal of Object Technology,4,,,Nowadays. UML is considered to be the standardized language for object-oriented modeling and analysis. However. UML cannot be used for automatic analyses and simulation. In this paper. we propose an approach for transforming UML statechart and collaboration diagrams to Colored Petri net models. This transformation aims to bridge the gap between informal notation (UML diagrams) and more formal notation (Colored Petri net models) for analysis purposes. It produces highlystructured. graphical. and rigorously-analyzable models that facilitate early detection of errors such as deadlock and livelock. The approach is based on graph transformations where the input and output of the transformation process are graphs. The meta-modeling tool AToM3 is used. A case study is presented to illustrate our approach.,True,wJ-MkNMAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC,55,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.179.1153&rep=rep1&type=pdf,15127047092775612629,/scholar?cites=15127047092775612629,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.179.1153&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

A MANET is a collection of mobile nodes connected by wireless links that form a temporary network topology that operates without a base station and centralized administration. Routing is a method through which information is forwarded from a transmitter to a specific recipient. Routing is a strategy that guarantees. at any time. the connection between any two nodes in a network. In this work. we propose a novel routing protocol inspired by the cuckoo search method.

First-order expansions usually consist of local terms typically involving the state and the adjoint solutions and their gradients estimated at the point where the topological perturbation is performed. In the case of second-order topological expansions. non-local terms which have a higher computational cost appear. Interactions between several simultaneous perturbations are also considered. The study is aimed at determining the relevance of these non-local and interaction terms from a numerical point of view.

Actually the domain representation. also known as distributed shape derivative. is more general than the boundary expression as it is well-defined for shapes having a lower regularity. It is customary in the shape optimization literature to assume regularity of the domains and use the boundary expression of the shape derivative for numerical algorithms. In this paper we describe several advantages of the distributed shape derivative in terms of generality. easiness of computation and numerical implementation. We identify a tensor representation of the distributed shape derivative. study its properties and show how it allows to recover the boundary expression directly.

In order to deal with this severely ill-posed inverse problem. we rewrite it as an optimization problem where a Kohn–Vogelius-type functional measuring the misfit between the solutions of two auxiliary problems is minimized. One auxiliary problem contains information on the boundary measurement while the other one corresponds to the boundary excitation. The solutions of the auxiliary problems coincide once the inverse problem is solved. In order to minimize the Kohn–Vogelius criterion. its total variation with respect to a set of ball-shaped perturbations on the measure is explicitly evaluated.

Currently utilized clinical techniques involve the surgical disruption and resection of lymphatic structure. whether nodes or axillary contents. for histological examination. While reasonably effective at detection of macrometastasis. the majority of the resected lymph nodes are histologically negative. Improvements need to be made to better detect micrometastasis. minimize or eliminate lymphatic disruption complications. and provide immediate and accurate intraoperative feedback for in vivo cancer staging to better guide surgery. We evaluated the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT). a high-resolution. real-time. label-free imaging modality for the intraoperative assessment of human LNs for metastatic disease in patients with breast cancer. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of double-blinded trained readers who analyzed intraoperative OCT LN images for presence of metastatic disease. using co-registered post-operative histopathology as the gold standard. Our results suggest that intraoperative OCT examination of LNs is an appropriate real-time. label-free. non-destructive alternative to frozen-section analysis. potentially offering faster interpretation and results to empower superior intraoperative decision-making.

However. most of the existing CNN-based SISR methods mainly focus on wider or deeper architecture design. neglecting to explore the feature correlations of intermediate layers. hence hindering the representational power of CNNs. To address this issue. in this paper. we propose a second-order attention network (SAN) for more powerful feature expression and feature correlation learning. Specifically. a novel train-able second-order channel attention (SOCA) module is developed to adaptively rescale the channel-wise features by using second-order feature statistics for more discriminative representations. Furthermore. we present a non-locally enhanced residual group (NLRG) structure. which not only incorporates non-local operations to capture long-distance spatial contextual information. but also contains repeated local-source residual attention groups (LSRAG) to learn increasingly abstract feature representations.

However. RT-PCR kits are costly and take 6-9 hours to confirm infection in the patient. Due to less sensitivity of RT-PCR. it provides high false-negative results. To resolve this problem. radiological imaging techniques such as chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) are used to detect and diagnose COVID-19. In this paper. chest X-rays is preferred over CT scan. The reason behind this is that X-rays machines are available in most of the hospitals. X-rays machines are cheaper than the CT scan machine. Besides this. X-rays has low ionizing radiations than CT scan. COVID-19 reveals some radiological signatures that can be easily detected through chest X-rays.

An electronic stethoscope is used for the acquisition of heart murmurs that is further classified into normal or abnormal murmurs. The process of heart sound segmentation involves discrete wavelet transform to obtain individual components of the heart signal and its separation into systole and diastole intervals. This research presents a novel scheme to develop a semi‐automatic cardiac valve disorder diagnosis system. Accordingly. features are extracted using wavelet transform and spectral analysis of input signals. The proposed classification scheme is the fusion of adaptive‐neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and HMM.

In the first step. the camera motion is eliminated using motion compensation. An adaptive subband decomposition structure is then used to analyze the motion compensated image. In the “low–high” and “high–low” subimages moving objects appear as outliers and they are detected using a statistical detection test based on fractional lower-order statistics. It turns out that the distribution of the subimage pixels is almost Gaussian in general.

In this method. a decision is made on whether the eyes are closed or not and. using a Markov chain framework to model temporal evolution. the subject's gaze is determined. The method can successfully track facial features even while the head assumes various poses. so long as the nostrils are visible to the camera. We compare our method with recently proposed techniques and results show that it provides more accurate tracking and robustness to variations in view of the face. A procedure for detecting tracking errors is employed to recover the loss of feature points in case of occlusion or very fast head movement.

Here we evaluate superposition of separate electric field calculations—one for each coil—for predicting SAR in a full numerical calculation where all coils are driven simultaneously. It is important to perform such an evaluation because the effects of coil coupling may alter the result. It is shown that while there is good agreement between the superimposed and …,True,5M007HcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,39,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cmr.b.20085,11081518291649367782,/scholar?cites=11081518291649367782,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cmr.b.20085,0,0,0

1281918,A conservative method for ensuring safety within transmit arrays,2007,CM Collins and Z Wang and MB Smith,,Proceedings of the Joint Annual Meeting ISMRM-ESMRMB,,19-25,,With transmit RF arrays it is possible to vary the RF magnetic (B1) field distribution within a given subject to achieve any number of goals with methods such as RF shimming (1) and transmit SENSE (2). With some methods. such as transmit SENSE. the magnetic field distribution is varied during the RF pulse. This makes determination of local SAR levels very difficult because the SAR pattern will change through time.Although the safety of a single RF coil can be determined based on the expected B1 field distribution of that coil. with a transmit array the field distributions that will be used in an experiment may not be known before the beginning of an experiment.

The semantic gap divides the high-level scene analysis of humans from the low-level pixel analysis of computers. In this paper. we suggest a more systematic and comprehensive view on the concept of gaps in Content based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) research. Also. several research directions for improving the retrieval quality based on the experiences from other closely related research fields are given in the paper.

Most existing deblurring methods model the observed blurry image as the convolution of a sharp image with a uniform blur kernel.

Saturated pixels violate the common assumption that the image-formation process is linear. and often cause ringing in deblurred outputs. We provide an analysis of ringing in general. and show that in order to prevent ringing. it is insufficient to simply discard saturated pixels. We show that even when saturated pixels are removed. ringing is caused by attempting to estimate the values of latent pixels that are brighter than the sensor’s maximum output. Estimating these latent pixels is likely to cause large errors. and these errors propagate across the rest of the image in the form of ringing. We propose a new deblurring algorithm that locates these error-prone bright pixels in the latent sharp image. and by decoupling them from the remainder of the latent image. greatly reduces ringing.

1281950,Efficient. blind. spatially-variant deblurring for shaken images.,2014,Oliver Whyte and Josef Sivic and Andrew Zisserman and Jean Ponce,,,,75-99,,In this chapter we discuss modelling and removing spatially-variant blur from photographs. We describe a compact global parameterization of camera-shake blur. based on the 3D rotation of the camera during the exposure. Our model uses threeparameter homographies to connect camera motion to image motion and. by assigning weights to a set of these homographies. can be seen as a generalization of the standard. spatially-invariant convolutional model of image blur. As such we show how existing algorithms. designed for spatially-invariant deblurring. can be ‘upgraded’in a straightforward manner to handle spatially-variant blur instead. We demonstrate this with algorithms working on real images. showing results for blind estimation of blur parameters from single images. followed by non-blind image restoration using these parameters. Finally. we introduce an efficient approximation to the global model. which significantly reduces the computational cost of modelling the spatially-variant blur. By approximating the blur as locally-uniform. we can take advantage of fast Fourier-domain convolution and deconvolution. reducing the time required for blind deblurring by an order of magnitude.,True,EVdWS-4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_tFkAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA75&dq=info:k6aa-3UzhLoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=wj9FmDR9L0&sig=r02Pspzh6x8cvO3X9HFTdvXMdL8,13439923769805809299,/scholar?cites=13439923769805809299,,,https://hal.inria.fr/docs/01/06/38/14/PDF/whyte13.pdf,0,0,0
1281951,Removing camera shake blur and unwanted occluders from photographs,2012,Oliver Whyte,,,,,,"This thesis investigates the removal of spatially-variant blur from photographs degraded by camera shake. and the removal of large occluding objects from photographs of popular places. We examine these problems in the case where the photographs are taken with standard consumer cameras. and we have no particular information about the scene being photographed. Most existing deblurring methods model the observed blurry image as the convolution of a sharp image with a uniform blur kernel. However. we show that blur from camera shake is in general mostly due to the 3D rotation of the camera. resulting in a blur that can be significantly non-uniform across the image. We model this blur using a weighted set of camera poses. which induce homographies on the image being captured. The blur in a particular image is parameterised by the set of weights. which provides a compact global descriptor for the blur. analogous to a convolution kernel. This descriptor fully captures the spatially-variant blur at all pixels. and is able to model camera shake more accurately than previous methods. We demonstrate direct estimation of the blur weights from single and multiple blurry images captured by conventional cameras. This permits a sharp image to be recovered from a blurry ""shaken"" image without any user interaction or additional infor- mation about the camera motion. For single image deblurring. we adapt an existing marginalisation-based algorithm and a maximum a posteriori-based algorithm. which are both compatible with our model of spatially-variant blur.

The optimum substitution matrix replaces the k-LSBs (Least Significant Bits) of the data by other optimum values in order to minimize the difference between the carrier image and the secret data. Finding the optimum substitution matrix has proved to be a computationally expensive process. In this paper. a dynamic programming strategy is implemented to find the optimum substitution matrix. After applying the optimum substitution matrix and the secret data is hidden into the image. a pixel adjustment process is used to decrease by about …,True,TBhFJEgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,24,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11979095496277545932&hl=en&oi=scholarr,11979095496277545932,/scholar?cites=11979095496277545932,,,,0,0,0

The method is based on 2D face image features using subset of non-correlated and Orthogonal Gabor Filters instead of using the whole Gabor Filter Bank. then compressing the output feature vector using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).

We propose a method to perform large-scale image forensics on the order of one million images using the help of an image search algorithm and database to gather contextual clues as to where tampering may have taken place. In this vein. we introduce five new strongly invariant image comparison methods and test their effectiveness under heavy noise. rotation. and color space changes.

Recently. this technology emerged as an important mechanism for access control in many modern applications. in which the traditional methods including the ones based on knowledge (eg. keywords) or based on tokens (eg. smart cards) might be ineffective because they are easily shared. lost. stolen. or manipulated [1]. Biometric technologies are increasingly used as the main authenticating factor for access control and also jointly with traditional authentication mechanisms. as a “step-up authentication” factor in two-or three-factor authentication systems.In this context. face. iris. and fingerprint are the most commonly used biometric traits. In fact. the choice of the trait to be used takes into account some issues such as universality. easiness to measure the biometric characteristics. performance. or difficulty to circumvent the system [1]. However. a common disadvantage of these traits is that an impostor might produce a synthetic replica that can be presented to the biometric sensor to circumvent the authentication process.

Techniques that rely on trespassing these kind of systems by using a forged biometric sample. such as a printed paper or a recorded video of a genuine access. are known as presentation attacks. but may be also referred in the literature as face spoofing. Presentation attack detection is a crucial step for preventing this kind of unauthorized accesses into restricted areas and/or devices. In this paper. we propose a novel approach which relies in a combination between intrinsic image properties and deep neural networks to detect presentation attack attempts. Our method explores depth. salience and illumination maps. associated with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network in order to produce robust and discriminant features. Each one of these properties are individually classified and. in the end of the process. they are combined by a meta learning classifier. which achieves outstanding results on the most popular datasets for PAD.

The presented study reports methodologies. algorithms and results on forest assessment utilizing such X-band satellite images. namely from TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed sensors. The proposed procedures cover advanced stereo-radargrammetric and interferometric data processing. as well as image segmentation and image classification. A core methodology is the multi-image matching concept for digital surface modeling based on geometrically constrained matching. Validation of generated surface models is made through comparison with LiDAR data. resulting in a standard deviation height error of less than 2 meters over forest. Image classification of forest regions is then based on X-band backscatter information. a canopy height model and interferometric coherence information yielding a classification accuracy above 90%. Such information is then directly used to extract forest border lines. High resolution X-band sensors deliver imagery that can be used for automatic forest assessment on a large scale.

It helps to reduce the complexity of image matching. which can be seen to be the most crucial step within a workflow to generate digital elevation models. In this paper. it is shown that this concept is also applicable to the cocircular geometry of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image pairs. First. it is proven that. for any feasible SAR acquisition. the deviation from true epipolar geometry is within subpixel range and therefore acceptably small. Based on this. we propose a method to create “epipolar” geometry for arbitrary stereo configurations of any SAR sensor through appropriate geometric image transformations. Consequently. the semiglobal matching (SGM) algorithm can be applied. which is restricted to epipolar geometry and is thus known to be highly efficient.

The use of optical imagery for degradation assessment in the tropics is limited due to frequent cloud cover.

In this study. we describe a method to detect areas affected by forest degradation from digital surface models derived from COSMO-SkyMed X-band Spotlight InSAR-Stereo Data. Two test sites with recent logging activities were chosen in Cameroon and in the Republic of Congo. Using the full resolution COSMO-SkyMed digital surface model and a 90-m resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission model or a mean filtered digital surface model we calculate difference models to detect canopy disturbances.

This approach can be used for whole body dynamic PET studies in which we compute voxel-wise estimates of Patlak parameters using two frames of data for each bed position. Our approach directly uses list-mode arrival times for each event to estimate the Patlak parametric image. We use a penalized likelihood method in which the penalty function uses spatially variant weighting to ensure a count independent local impulse response. We evaluate performance of the method in comparison to fractional changes in SUV values (%DSUV) between the two frames using Cramer Rao analysis and Monte Carlo simulation.

The forward projector consists of a 2-D projector. which maps 3-D images into 2-D direct sinograms. followed by exact inverse rebinning which maps the 2-D into fully 3-D sinograms.

The speed and localisation accuracy are two ongoing challenges in real-world anomaly detection. We introduce two novel cubic-patch-based anomaly detector where one works based on power of an auto-encoder (AE) on reconstituting an input video patch and another one is based on the power of sparse representation of an input video patch. It is found that if an AE is efficiently trained on all normal patches. the anomaly patch in testing phase has a more reconstruction error than a normal patch. Also if a sparse AE is learned based on normal training patches. we expect that the given patch to AE is represented sparsely. If the representation is not enough sparse it is considered as a good candidate to be anomaly. For being more fast. these two detectors are combined as a cascade classifier.

The proposed algorithm partitions a 3-D carotid MR image into three regions: wall. lumen. and background. The algorithm performs such partitioning by simultaneously evolving two coupled 3-D surfaces of carotid artery adventitia boundary (AB) and lumen-intima boundary (LIB) while preserving their anatomical inter-surface consistency such that the LIB is always located within the AB. In particular. we show that the proposed algorithm results in a fully time implicit scheme that propagates the two linearly ordered surfaces of the AB and LIB to their globally optimal positions during each discrete time frame by convex relaxation.

Our method overcomes the existing challenges of segmenting 3D prostate MRIs: heterogeneous intensity distributions and a wide variety of prostate shape appearances. We introduce a novel convex relaxation-based method to evolve a contour to its globally optimal position during each discrete time frame. The proposed generic star shape prior provides robustness to the segmentation when the image suffer from poor quality. noise. and artifacts.

Traffic in the upcoming wireless networks is expected to be extremely non stationary. For the traffic of real-time classes which are non stationary at the base station. the performance of scheduler gets degraded due to the presence of arrival rate estimation errors.

It determines the optimum set of admissible users with the optimum transmitting power level. so as to minimize the interference level and call rejection rate. In addition to this. an adaptive scheduling scheme to allocate optimum rate for each traffic queue is proposed to minimize the scheduling delay.

Minimizing embedding impact and maximizing embedding capacity are the key factors of any steganography algorithm. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) is the familiar metric used in discriminating the distorted image (stego image) and cover image. Here matrix embedding technique is chosen to embed the secret image which is initially Huffman encoded. The Huffman encoded image is overlaid on the selected bits of all the channels of pixels of cover image through matrix embedding. As a result. the stego image is constructed with very less distortion when compared to the cover image ends up with higher PSNR value. A secret image which cannot be embedded in a normal LSB embedding technique can be overlaid in this proposed technique since the secret image is Huffman encoded. Experimental results for standard cover images. which obtained higher PSNR value during the operation is shown in this paper.,True,37HPo2DxoMEC:g5m5HwL7SMYC,22,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.227.6535&rep=rep1&type=pdf,5998369342369720470,/scholar?cites=5998369342369720470,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.227.6535&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Due to the raise in convention of many applications currently. there is a necessity for high processing and storage capacity along with the consideration of cost and instance use. To provide proficient resources. Cloud computing is been pioneered. In this paper Time and Cost Optimization for Hybrid Clouds (TCHC) algorithm is proposed to reduce the execution time and cost of multiple workflows scheduling. The users nowadays don’t want to get stuck to their own cloud providers to execute or schedule the multiple workflows. Many organizations have their own private cloud. but when there is a need for extra resources they go for public cloud where they have been outlaid for their use. In case of dependent workflow scheduling. the switching between private and public cloud resources will lead to increased execution time and cost. The multiple requests made for the resources will result in increased bandwidth. As a remedy TCHC buffers the resource in the local resource pool. that might help if there is change in on demand resource price after an instant and it also reduces the requesting cost. The proposed strategy TCHC algorithm comes to the decision of deciding which resource should be chartered from public providers.,True,37HPo2DxoMEC:ZHo1McVdvXMC,21,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.476.2761&rep=rep1&type=pdf,17453748160569789786,/scholar?cites=17453748160569789786,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.476.2761&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Among the various dimensionality reduction algorithms. linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is one of the popular supervised dimensionality reduction methods. and many LDA-based face recognition algorithms/systems have been reported in the last decade. However. the LDA based face recognition systems suffer from the scalability problem. To overcome this limitation. an incremental approach is usually adopted. Incremental LDA (ILDA) methods have been studied for many years in the statistical and machine-learning community.

In this survey. we study the issues and existing protocols in three areas: coverage. routing. and robustness. We present two types of coverage problems: to determine the minimum number of sensor nodes that need to perform active sensing in order to monitor a certain area; and to decide the quality of service that can be provided by a given sensor network. While most routing protocols in sensor networks are data-centric. there are other types of routing protocols as well. such as hierarchical. location-based. and QoS-aware. We describe and compare several protocols in each group. Robustness is an important topic in sensor networks since sensor nodes are prone to failure and wireless channels are unreliable.

Transform coding. on the other hand. first transforms the image from its spatial domain representation to a different type of representation using some well-known transform and then codes the transformed values (coefficients). Image compression is urgently needed for very large medical or satellite images. both for reducing the storage requirements and for improving transmission efficiency. Fourier based transforms (eg DCT and DFT) are efficient in exploiting the low frequency nature of an image. The high frequency coefficients are coarsely quantized. and hence the reconstructed quality of the image at the edges will have poor quality. On the other hand. wavelets are efficient in representing nonstationary signals because of the adaptive time-frequency window. So the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied to an image and the energy compaction performance of both Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and DWT is compared.

Krishnamoorthy,28,Pattern Recognition Letters,7,771-777,,A new transform coding technique based on a set of orthogonal polynomials has been proposed in this paper. In the transformed domain. statistical design of experiments approach is used to separate the spatial variation due to discriminable low level features (signals) from the spatial variation due to an unexplained source called noise. The proposed polynomial transform has a low computational complexity because it is configured as an integer transform. The proposed transform also has very good compression ability or separationability. The degree of this separationability can be controlled by specifying the level of the signal-to-noise ratio.,True,uyManhQAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,21,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865506002625,1303983223639003397,/scholar?cites=1303983223639003397,,,http://14.139.186.108/jspui/bitstream/123456789/23258/1/Trasform.pdf,0,0,0

One of the most important performance goals is the rate of fault detection. Test cases should run in an order that increases the possibility of fault detection and also that detects the most severe faults at the earliest in its testing life cycle. Test case prioritization techniques have proved to be beneficial for improving regression testing activities. While code coverage based prioritization techniques are found to be taken by most scholars. test case prioritization based on requirements in a cost effective manner has not been taken for study so far.

Sheba Kezia Malarchelvi,8,International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security,5,195-204,,In this paper. we propose a new image encryption technique in orthogonal polynomials based transformation domain (OPT) with selective combinational scrambling for secure transmission of images. Normally. the values of the neighboring pixels are highly correlated in most of the images. In order to de-correlate the intelligible information present in the image we propose the use of orthogonal polynomials based transformation. Also. the proposed technique exploits the energy preserving property of the orthogonal polynomials based transform coding which compacts energy in a few low frequency coefficients. These low frequency coefficients are selected as candidates for encryption which significantly reduces the number of bits to be encrypted. Then shuffling of these coefficients and their bits are performed. In addition. the sign bits of the selected low frequency coefficients are encrypted and randomly selected transformed blocks are shuffled. A symmetric key based cryptographically secure pseudo random process controls the entire encryption process. Experimental results reveal that the proposed OPT domain encryption scheme provides very low encryption PSNRs implying effective encryption.

However. if this strategy is generalized to a multi-GPU cluster. the processing speed does not improve linearly with the number of GPUs.

Founded on the spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian. this paper learns a kernel matrix via minimizing the leave-one-out classification error on the labeled instances. To this end. an efficient algorithm is presented based on linear programming. resulting in a transductive spectral kernel. The idea of our algorithm stems from regularization methodology and also has a nice interpretation in terms of spectral clustering. A simple classifier can be readily built upon the learned kernel. which suffices to give prediction for any data point aside from those in the available dataset.

Two different classification methods. i.e. the support vector machines (SVM) and the spectral angle mapper (SAM) were applied on the datasets to test their ability for discrimination of various vegetation species.

Near-infrared spectral measurements allow the sensing of subsurface tissue structure which is significantly different from person to person but relatively stable over time.

We examine the utility of using near-infrared hyperspectral images for the recognition of human subjects over a database of 200 subjects.

Due to their matrix. such materials typically posses high compressive strengths while the fibers contribute tensile strength to the overall material properties. Measuring these fibers’ orientation distribution in images obtained eg by micro-computed tomography (µCT) or scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) enables an assessment of mechanical properties of a specimen. Unfortunately. image quality is often low. which complicates the segmentation of fibers in such images. We have recently proposed a method for computing fiber orientations directly from gray valued images. This method applies anisotropic Gaussian convolution filters to find the likely local orientation in each pixel. An efficient implementation of this filter operation in 2D and 3D is available. By accumulating the local orientations of foreground pixels in the second order orientation tensor. mean fiber orientations and information on the shape of the fiber orientation distribution can be computed.

The spatial arrangement of the fibres and in particular their direction distribution have huge impact on macroscopic properties and. thus. its determination is an important topic of material characterisation. The fibre direction distribution is defined on the unit sphere. and it is therefore preferable to work with fully three-dimensional images of the microstructure as obtained. eg. by computed micro-tomography. A number of recent image analysis algorithms exploit local grey value variations to estimate a preferred direction in each fibre point. Averaging these local results leads estimates of the volume-weighted fibre direction distribution. We show how the thus derived fibre direction distribution is related to quantities commonly used in engineering applications. Furthermore. we discuss four algorithms for local orientation analysis. namely those based on the response of anisotropic Gaussian filters. moments and axes of inertia derived from directed distance transforms. the structure tensor. or the Hessian matrix.

In this paper. we formulate this data fusion problem as the minimization of a convex objective function containing two data-fitting terms and an edge-preserving regularizer. The data-fitting terms are quadratic and account for blur. different spatial resolutions. and additive noise; the regularizer. a form of vector Total Variation. promotes aligned discontinuities across the reconstructed hyperspectral bands.

On this regards. hyperspectral and multispectral images have complementary characteristics in terms of spectral and spatial resolutions. In this paper we propose an approach for the fusion of low spatial resolution hyperspectral images with high spatial resolution multispectral images in order to obtain superresolution (spatial and spectral) hyperspectral images. The proposed approach is based on the assumption that. since both hyperspectral and multispectral images acquired on the same scene. the corresponding endmembers should be the same. On a first step the hyperspectral image is spectrally down-sampled in order to match the multispectral one. Then an endmember extraction algorithm is performed on the down-sampled hyperspectral image and the successive abundance estimation is …,True,hjMg7-IAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,13,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8077569/,8825531359002088422,/scholar?cites=8825531359002088422,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/01/01/04/28/PDF/paper_whispers_sr_v2.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,We propose a total variation based model for simultaneous image inpainting and blind deconvolution. We demonstrate that the tasks are inherently coupled together and that solving them individually will lead to poor results. The main advantages of our model are that (i) boundary conditions for deconvolution required near the interface between observed and occluded regions are naturally generated through inpainting; (ii) inpainting results are enhanced through deconvolution (as opposed to inpainting blurry images). As a result. ringing effects due to imposing improper boundary conditions and errors due to imperfection of inpainting blurry images are reduced. Moreover. our model can also be used to generate boundary conditions for regular deconvolution problems that yields better results than previous methods.© 2005 Wiley Periodicals.

There are several contributions in this paper.(1) We realize that. beyond controlling the smoothness of the solution. λ exhibits another significant behavior—causality. This property allows us to solve the problem by incrementally increasing λ so that each solution at a given regularization parameter can be used to solve the problem at a larger parameter efficiently. We call such a technique parameter marching.(2) While λ is allowed to take a continuum of non-negative values. we show that only a unique finite number of them are critical and useful in the sense that they correspond to meaningful changes in signal features. Furthermore. we present the construction of these critical λ’s.(3) Since the analysis of the TV model is carried out by deriving exact solutions and investigating the dynamics of the solutions as λ varies. many properties of the model which previously have not been studied to a rigorous extent are clearly revealed. A discussion of other possible further research within the parameter marching framework is also given. In particular. we present some insights into the improvement of the TV model provided by our analysis.

Our approach relies on the recognition of speech and gestures for the processing of requests. dealing with information that can potentially be contradictory or complementary.

This paper presents a local adaptive thresholding technique based on gray level cooccurrence matrix- (GLCM-) energy information for retinal vessel segmentation.  Different thresholds were computed using GLCM-energy information. An experimental evaluation on DRIVE database using the grayscale intensity and Green Channel of the retinal image demonstrates the high performance of the proposed local adaptive thresholding technique. The maximum average accuracy rates of 0.9511 and 0.9510 with maximum average sensitivity rates of 0.7650 and 0.7641 were achieved on DRIVE and STARE databases. respectively.

While surveillance has traditionally been a manual task using crew members in lookout positions on parts of the ship. much work is being done to automate this task using digital cameras coupled with a computer that uses image processing techniques that intelligently track object in the maritime environment. One such technique is level set segmentation which evolves a contour to objects of interest in a given image. This method works well but gives incorrect segmentation results when a target object is corrupted in the image. This paper explores the possibility of factoring in prior knowledge of a ship’s shape into level set segmentation to improve results. a concept that is unaddressed in maritime surveillance problem.

We propose a novel two-stage technique which achieves improved detection results by applying temporal and spatial constraints to the occurrences of traffic signs in video.

An approach is proposed for determining the absolute orientation of an autonomous robot in a system of corridors. based on the projective geometry and active computer vision. In the proposed approach. the common direction of longitudinal corridor edges is inferred by detecting the vanishing point of the corresponding straight line segments in the image. It is assumed that the knowledge about the vertical direction in the scene is available. so that the image coordinates of these vanishing points are considerably constrained.

A classic procedure for monitoring the tracking quality consists in requiring that the current features nicely warp towards their reference appearances. The procedure recommends focusing on features projected from planar 3D patches (planar features). by enforcing a conservative threshold on the residual of the difference between the warped current feature and the reference. However. in some important contexts. there are many features for which the planarity assumption is only partially satisfied. while the true planar features are not so abundant.

The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the Yale B database and the Feret illumination database using two face recognition methods: PCA based and Local Binary Pattern based (LBP).

In this paper we describe a new descriptor. POEM (patterns of oriented edge magnitudes). by applying a self-similarity based structure on oriented magnitudes and prove that it addresses all three criteria. Experimental results on the FERET database show that POEM outperforms other descriptors when used with nearest neighbour classifiers.

The whitened principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction technique is applied upon both the POEM- and POD-based representations to get more compact and discriminative face descriptors.

It consists in applying rotation invariant local binary pattern operators (LBP riu 2) to a series of moment images. defined by local statistics uniformly computed using a given spatial support. It can be seen as a generalisation of the commonly used complementation approach (CLBP). since it extends the local description not only to local contrast information. but also to higher order local variations. In short. SBPs aim at expanding LBP self-similarity operator from the local grey level to the regional distribution level. Thanks to a richer local description. the SBPs have better discrimination power than other LBP variants.

1282220,A variational approach to hyperspectral image fusion,2009,Michael Moeller and Todd Wittman and Andrea L Bertozzi,7334,,,73341E,International Society for Optics and Photonics,There has been significant research on pan-sharpening multispectral imagery with a high resolution image. but there has been little work extending the procedure to high dimensional hyperspectral imagery. We present a wavelet-based variational method for fusing a high resolution image and a hyperspectral image with an arbitrary number of bands. To ensure that the fused image can be used for tasks such as classification and detection. we explicitly enforce spectral coherence in the fusion process. This procedure produces images with both high spatial and spectral quality. We demonstrate this procedure on several AVIRIS and HYDICE images.,True,R7zDx6QAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,59,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7334/73341E/A-variational-approach-to-hyperspectral-image-fusion/10.1117/12.818243.short,17953562168658785255,/scholar?cites=17953562168658785255,,,https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/papers/SPIE09.pdf,0,0,0

To represent the major mathematical approaches to image processing. we discuss and evaluate five different image interpolation methods.

One important property is the structure of the placental blood vessels. which supply a fetus with all of its oxygen and nutrition. An essential step in the analysis of the vascular network pattern is the extraction of the blood vessels. which has only been done manually through a costly and time-consuming process. There is no existing method to automatically detect placental blood vessels; in addition. the large variation in the shape. color. and texture of the placenta makes it difficult to apply standard edge-detection algorithms.

JDE is built by making use of a regional bilinear generative model of the BOLD response and constraining the parameter estimation by physiological priors using temporal and spatial information in a Markovian model. In contrast to previous works that use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to sample the resulting intractable posterior distribution. we recast the JDE into a missing data framework and derive a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm for its …,True,bUpOvkgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,77,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6335481/,17027908188548866721,/scholar?cites=17027908188548866721,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4020803/,0,0,0

If a probabilistic approach is adopted. it becomes then necessary to estimate the hyperparameters characterizing the probability distribution of the frame coefficients. This problem is difficult since in general the frame synthesis operator is not bijective. Consequently. the frame coefficients are not directly observable. This paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian model for frame representation. The posterior distribution of the frame coefficients and model hyperparameters is derived. Hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are subsequently proposed to sample from this posterior distribution. The generated samples are then exploited to estimate the hyperparameters and the frame coefficients of the target signal.

Its performance depends on the reconstruction algorithm. which can proceed either in the k-space or in the image domain. To improve the performance of the widely used SENSE algorithm. 2D regularization in the wavelet domain has been investigated.

This question is usually addressed by estimating the so-called Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF).

1282282,3D brain tumors and internal brain structures segmentation in MR images,2008,Hassan Khotanlou,,,,,,The main topic of this thesis is to segment brain tumors. their components (edema and necrosis) and internal structures of the brain in 3D MR images. For tumor segmentation we propose a framework that is a combination of region-based and boundary-based paradigms. In this framework. we first segment the brain using a method adapted for pathological cases and extract some global information on the tumor by symmetrybased histogram analysis. The second step segments the tumor and its components. For this. we propose a new and original method that combines region and boundary information in two phases: initialization and refinement. For initialization. which is mostly region-based. we present two new methods. The first one is a new fuzzy classification method which combines the membership. typicality and neighborhood information of the voxels. The second one relies on symmetry-based histogram analysis. The initial segmentation of the tumor is refined relying on boundary information of the image. This method is a deformable model constrained by spatial relations. The spatial relations are obtained based on the initial segmentation and surrounded tissues of the tumor. The proposed method can be used for a large class of tumors in any modality of MR images. To segment a tumor and its components full automatically the proposed framework needs only a contrast enhanced T1-weighted image and a FLAIR image. In the case of a contrast enhanced T1-weighted image only. some user interaction will be needed. We evaluated this method on a data set of 20 contrast enhanced T1-weighted and 10 FLAIR images with different types …,True,5YX31NgAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,23,https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00003662/,12097001416040533792,/scholar?cites=12097001416040533792,,,https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00003662/document,0,0,0

Law enforcement agents may find it increasingly difficult to stay afloat above the ill intentions of hackers. We have been able to develop an image scrambling algorithm that is very simple to implement but almost impossible to breach with a probability less than 5x10− 300. This is possible due to the fact that a user may purchase or acquire rights for an intended image by specifying a ‘key’ that can form a sequence of numbers 10 to 100 in length. The content provider uses this sequence as a base in developing another key sequence to scramble the image and transmit it to the user through regular channels such as an email attachment.

1282294,Local mechanical stimuli regulate bone formation and resorption in mice at the tissue level,2013,Friederike A Schulte and Davide Ruffoni and Floor M Lambers and David Christen and Duncan J Webster and Gisela Kuhn and Ralph Müller,8,PloS one,4,e62172,Public Library of Science,Bone is able to react to changing mechanical demands by adapting its internal microstructure through bone forming and resorbing cells. This process is called bone modeling and remodeling. It is evident that changes in mechanical demands at the organ level must be interpreted at the tissue level where bone (re)modeling takes place. Although assumed for a long time. the relationship between the locations of bone formation and resorption and the local mechanical environment is still under debate. The lack of suitable imaging modalities for measuring bone formation and resorption in vivo has made it difficult to assess the mechanoregulation of bone three-dimensionally by experiment. Using in vivo micro-computed tomography and high resolution finite element analysis in living mice. we show that bone formation most likely occurs at sites of high local mechanical strain (p<0.0001) and resorption at sites of low local mechanical strain (p<0.0001). Furthermore. the probability of bone resorption decreases exponentially with increasing mechanical stimulus (R2 = 0.99) whereas the probability of bone formation follows an exponential growth function to a maximum value (R2 = 0.99). Moreover. resorption is more strictly controlled than formation in loaded animals. and ovariectomy increases the amount of non-targeted resorption. Our experimental assessment of mechanoregulation at the tissue level does not show any evidence of a lazy zone and suggests that around 80% of all (re)modeling can be linked to the mechanical micro-environment.

In this study. we hypothesize that trabecular load-induced bone formation can be predicted by mechanical signals derived from an integrative µFE model. incorporating a description of both the bone and marrow phase. Using the mouse tail loading model in combination with in vivo micro-computed tomography (µCT) we tracked load induced changes in the sixth caudal vertebrae of C57BL/6 mice to quantify the amount of newly mineralized and eroded bone volumes.

Different methods of the line model generation are investigated. Depending on the scenario and the given 3D model either the image gradient of the frame buffer or discontinuities of the z-buffer and the normal map are used for the generation of a 2D edge map. The 3D control points on a contour are calculated by using the depth value stored in the z-buffer. By aligning the generated features with edges in the current image. the extrinsic parameters of the camera are estimated. The camera pose used for rendering is predicted by a line-based frame-to-frame tracking which takes advantage of …,True,iYT87BQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,48,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74272-2_3,8504237995428256666,/scholar?cites=8504237995428256666,,,,0,0,0

1282327,ECG Classification Using Wavelet Packet Entropy and Random Forests,2016,Taiyong Li and Zhou Min,18,Entropy,8,1-16,,The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important techniques for heart disease diagnosis. Many traditional methodologies of feature extraction and classification have been widely applied to ECG analysis. However. the effectiveness and efficiency of such methodologies remain to be improved. and much existing research did not consider the separation of training and testing samples from the same set of patients (so called inter-patient scheme). To cope with these issues. in this paper. we propose a method to classify ECG signals using wavelet packet entropy (WPE) and random forests (RF) following the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) recommendations and the inter-patient scheme. Specifically. we firstly decompose the ECG signals by wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). and then calculate entropy from the decomposed coefficients as representative features. and finally use RF to build an ECG classification model. To the best of our knowledge. it is the first time that WPE and RF are used to classify ECG following the AAMI recommendations and the inter-patient scheme. Extensive experiments are conducted on the publicly available MIT–BIH Arrhythmia database and influence of mother wavelets and level of decomposition for WPD. type of entropy and the number of base learners in RF on the performance are also discussed. The experimental results are superior to those by several state-of-the-art competing methods. showing that WPE and RF is promising for ECG classification.

However. the sequences of crude oil prices usually show some characteristics of nonstationarity and nonlinearity. making it very challenging for accurate forecasting crude oil prices. To cope with this issue. in this paper. we propose a novel approach that integrates complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST). so-called CEEMDAN-XGBOOST. for forecasting crude oil prices. Firstly. we use CEEMDAN to decompose the nonstationary and nonlinear sequences of crude oil prices into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue. Secondly. XGBOOST is used to predict each IMF and the residue individually. Finally. the corresponding prediction results of each IMF and the residue are aggregated as the final forecasting results.

An accurate prediction for crude oil price is an interesting and challenging task for enterprises. governments. investors. and researchers. To cope with this issue. in this paper. we proposed a method integrating ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO). and relevance vector machine (RVM)—namely. EEMD-APSO-RVM—to predict crude oil price based on the “decomposition and ensemble” framework. Specifically. the raw time series of crude oil price were firstly decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue by EEMD. Then. RVM with combined kernels was applied to predict target value for the residue and each IMF individually. To improve the prediction performance of each component. an extended particle swarm optimization (PSO) was utilized to simultaneously optimize the weights and parameters of single kernels for the combined kernel of RVM. Finally. simple addition was used to aggregate all the predicted results of components into an ensemble result as the final result. Extensive experiments were conducted on the crude oil spot price of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to illustrate and evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results are superior to those by several state-of-the-art benchmark methods in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE). mean absolute percent error (MAPE). and directional statistic (Dstat). showing that the proposed EEMD-APSO-RVM is promising for forecasting crude oil price.

1282366,Segmentation of thematic maps using colour and spatial attributes,1997,Jorge Silva Centeno,,,,221-230,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,We describe an approach for the extraction of land-use classes from colour thematic maps. The topic addressed in this papers deals more precisely with the spatial delimitation of colour textured areas. The process starts with the separation of colour layers from scanned maps. Therefore. a colour segmentation is performed. Land-use classes are then extracted from the binary images. To obtain the contours of textured regions we use an approach based on the Delaunay triangulation. It enables to spatially define textured regions by analyzing the spatial relationship between neighbouring pixels. not necessary adjacent. Examples illustrate the different steps of the segmentation procedure.,True,Nc2vNHIAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC,19,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-64381-8_51,3914632648460711051,/scholar?cites=3914632648460711051,,,,0,0,0

1282380,Performance of dead reckoning‐based location service for mobile ad hoc networks,2004,Vijay Kumar and Samir R Das,4,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,2,189-202,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,A predictive model‐based mobility tracking method. called dead reckoning. is developed for mobile ad hoc networks. It disseminates both location and movement models of mobile nodes in the network so that every node is able to predict or track the movement of every other node with a very low overhead. The basic technique is optimized to use ‘distance effect’. where distant nodes maintain less accurate tracking information to save overheads. The dead reckoning‐based location service mechanism is evaluated against three known location dissemination service protocols: simple. distance routing effect algorithm for mobility (DREAM) and geographic region summary service (GRSS). The evaluation is done with geographic routing as an application. It is observed that dead reckoning significantly outperforms the other protocols in terms of packet delivery fraction. It also maintains low‐control overhead.

1282384,A robust image encryption algorithm resistant to attacks using DNA and chaotic logistic maps,2016,Anchal Jain and Navin Rajpal,75,Multimedia Tools and Applications,10,5455-5472,Springer US,An image encryption technique using DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) operations and chaotic maps has been proposed in this paper. Firstly. the input image is DNA encoded and a mask is generated by using 1D chaotic map. This mask is added with the DNA encoded image using DNA addition.

Our experiment challenges this assumption. Our results indicate that the optical rotatory power (ORP) of some nano-scale double-twist cylinders in a BPLC composite causes the polarization axis of the transmitted light to rotate a small angle. which in turn leaks through the crossed polarizers. Rotating the analyzer in azimuthal direction to correct this ORP can greatly improve the contrast ratio.

In this paper. we introduce an autostereoscopic display that uses a scalable array of digital light projectors and a projection screen augmented with microlenses to simulate a light field for a given three-dimensional scene. Physical objects emit or reflect light in all directions to create a light field that can be approximated by the light field display. The display can simultaneously provide many viewers from different viewpoints a stereoscopic effect without head tracking or special viewing glasses. This work focuses on two important technical problems related to the light field display: calibration and rendering.

This algorithm requires no explicit segmentation or tracking of individual vehicles. which is usually an important part of many existing algorithms. Therefore. this algorithm is particularly useful when there are severe occlusions or vehicle resolution is low. in which extracted features are highly unreliable. There are mainly two contributions in our proposed algorithm. First. a warping method is developed to detect the foreground segments that contain unclassified vehicles. The common used modeling and tracking (e.g.. Kalman filtering) of individual vehicles are not required. In order to reduce vehicle distortion caused by the foreshortening effect. a nonuniform mesh grid and a projective transformation are estimated and applied during the warping process.

Most existing algorithms focus on the appearance difference between real and fake iris (for example. printed patterns. cosmetic contact lenses etc.) which is a very difficult problem. Instead of studying image properties of fake irises. we show that pupil constriction. the fundamental characteristic of real and live irises. can be very robust for liveness detection. In this experimental study. we first build an iris acquisition system that can acquire two eye images under two different illumination conditions in a less intrusive environment.

1282432,Interreflection removal for photometric stereo by using spectrum-dependent albedo,2011,Miao Liao and Xinyu Huang and Ruigang Yang,,,,689-696,IEEE,We present a novel method that can separate m-bounced light and remove the interreflections in a photometric stereo setup. Under the assumption of a uniformly colored lambertian surface. the intensity of a point in the scene is the sum of 1-bounced light through m-bounced light rays. Ruled by the law of diffuse reflection. whenever a light ray is bounced by the surface. its intensity will be attenuated by the factor of albedo ρ. This implies that the measured intensity value can be written as a polynomial function of ρ. and the intensity contribution of the m-bounced light rays are expressed by the term of ρ m . Therefore. when we change the surface albedo. the intensity of the m-bounced light is changed to the order of m. This non-linearity gives us the possibility to separate the m-bounced light. In practice. we illuminate the scene with different light colors to effectively simulate different surface albedos since albedo is …,True,cL4bNBwAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,39,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5995343/,15306735751886831874,/scholar?cites=15306735751886831874,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.361.2525&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Much work has been done in the field of human motion and gait recognition. and many interesting methods for detecting and classifying motion have been developed. However. systems that can robustly recognize human behavior in real-world contexts have yet to be developed. A significant reason for this is that the activities of humans in typical settings are unconstrained in terms of the motion path. People are free to move throughout the area of interest in any direction they like. While there have been many good classification systems developed in this domain. the majority of these systems have used a single camera providing input to a training-based learning method.

Further tasks might include the recognition of objects in the surrounding environment. Three dimensional range finders have become the sensors of choice for mapping the environment of a robot. Recognizing objects in point clouds provided by such sensors is a difficult task. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new covariance based point cloud descriptor for such object recognition. Covariance based descriptors have been very successful in image processing. One of the main advantages of these descriptors is their relatively small size. The comparisons between different covariance matrices can also be made very efficient.

The recent introduction of cheap range sensors like the Microsoft Kinect has created a great interest in the computer vision community towards developing efficient algorithms for point cloud processing.

In this paper. we present a simple guide of determine the thyroid lobes in the thyroid ultrasound image using a MATLAB. The image undergoes the contrast enhancement to suppress speckle. The enhancement image is used for further processing of segmentation the thyroid region by local region-based active contour. The thyroid region is segmented into two parts. which are right and left with the active contour method separately. This is accordingly to the thyroid have two lobes; right lobe and left lobe. Thyroid ultrasound image of transverse view is used in this study. Therefore. the measurements only involve the width. depth and area of the thyroid region. The result of thyroid measurement is successfully calculated in pixel unit. The measurement is converted in centimetre (cm) unit. The proposed method is benefited to enhance the image and segmentation the thyroid lobe.

We show that an ambiguity still persists. although the model with light attenuation factor has previously been shown to be well-posed under appropriate assumptions. Analytical results revealing the ambiguity are complemented by various numerical tests. Moreover. we present convergence results for two iterative approximation schemes.

The convergence results are obtained in the general framework of viscosity solutions of the underlying partial differential equation.

It has been introduced by Lerallut et al. in a discrete formulation. Experimental evidence shows that iterated amoeba median filtering leads to segmentation-like results that are similar to those obtained by self-snakes. an image filter based on a partial differential equation. We establish this correspondence by analysing a space-continuous formulation of iterated amoeba median filtering. We prove that in the limit of vanishing radius of the structuring elements. iterated amoeba median filtering indeed approximates the partial differential equation of self-snakes.

As a remedy. we present a novel anisotropic disparity-driven approach for stereo vision. It is designed as a highly adaptive anisotropic diffusion-reaction equation that incorporates a diffusion process which has been used successfully for image denoising and inpainting. Its directional adaptation allows to better control the smoothing wrt the local structure of the disparity field.

The parallelization of the FMM is not easy because of its intrinsic sequential nature. In this paper we propose a novel approach to parallelize the FMM. It leads to an equation-dependent domain decomposition and it turns out to be particularly suitable for machines with two or four cores that are in common use today. Compared to other techniques in the field. the proposed method is much simpler to implement and it gives a slightly better computational speed-up.In order to test the new method on a real-world application. we solve the shape-from-shading problem based on a Hamilton–Jacobi equation.

Heidelberg,Although shape from shading (SfS) has been studied for almost four decades. the performance of most methods applied to real-world images is still unsatisfactory: This is often caused by oversimplified reflectance and projection models as well as by ignoring light attenuation and nonconstant albedo behavior. We address this problem by proposing a novel approach that combines three powerful concepts: (i) By means of a Chan-Vese segmentation step. we partition the image into regions with homogeneous reflectance properties. (ii) This homogeneity is further improved by an adaptive thresholding that singles out unreliable details which cause fluctuating albedos. Using an inpainting method based on edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion. structures are filled in such that the albedo does no longer suffer from fluctuations.

Algorithms that exploit the formulation of these processes in terms of partial differential equations offer advantages for non-digitally scalable structuring elements and allow sub-pixel accuracy. However. the widely-used schemes from the literature suffer from significant blurring at discontinuities. We address this problem by developing a novel. flux corrected transport (FCT) type algorithm for morphological dilation/erosion with a flat disc. It uses the viscosity form of an upwind scheme in order to quantify the undesired diffusive effects. In a subsequent corrector step we compensate for these artifacts by means of a stabilised inverse diffusion process that requires a specific nonlinear multidimensional formulation.

New York. NY 10001. USA India,Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) are composed of autonomous nodes that are self-managed. dynamically deployed without any pre-existing infrastructure. Gray hole attacks are an active type of attack. which leads to dropping of messages. attacking node first agrees to forward packets and then fails to do so. For this we are using an AODV routing protocol to discover route. Initially the Malicious node behaves correctly and a reply sends true Route Reply (RREP) messages to nodes that initiate Route request (RREQ) messages. We use an intrusion detection system (IDS) to monitors the network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violation and produces reports to a Management Station. It takes over the sending packets. Afterwards. the node just drops the packets to launch a (DoS) denial of service attack. If neighbors nodes that try to send packets over attacking nodes lose the connection to destination then they may want to discover a route again and broadcasting Route Request (RREQ) messages.

There has been great amount of work done in the field of network intrusion detection over the past three decades. With networks getting faster and with the increasing dependence on the Internet both at the personal and commercial level. intrusion detection becomes a challenging process. The challenge here is not only to be able to actively monitor large numbers of systems. but also to be able to react quickly to different events. Before deploying a honeypot it is advisable to have a clear idea of what the honeypot should and should not do. There should be clear understanding of the operating systems to be used and services (like a web server. ftp server etc) a honeypot will run. The risks involved should be taken into consideration and methods to tackle or reduce these risks should be understood. It is also advisable to have a plan on what to do should the honeypot be compromised. In case of production honeypots. a honeypot policy addressing security issues should be documented.

Trust combination algorithms and trust mapping functions are provided in this model. where the former can aggregate different opinions together to get a new recommendation opinion. Based on this trust model. we design our trusted routing protocols for MANET called TAODV on top of Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol. We extend the routing table and the routing messages of ADOV with trust information which can be updated directly through monitoring in the neighborhood. When performing trusted routing discovery. unlike those cryptographic schemes that perform signature generation or verification at every routing packet. we just combine the recommended opinions together and make a routing judgment based on each element of the new opinion. In this way the computation overhead can be largely reduced. and the trustworthiness of the routing procedure can be guaranteed as well. In this thesis. we implement the security and selfishness issues of wireless networks. either in non-cooperative form or in cooperative form. Our results show that the cumulative utilities of cooperative nodes are increased steadily and the selfish nodes cannot get more utilities by behaving selfishly than cooperatively.,True,6tV8Ut8AAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C,26,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1050.7571&rep=rep1&type=pdf,3893286446896971671,/scholar?cites=3893286446896971671,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1050.7571&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The Cloud can facilitate its clients enormous resources hence even during heavy load conditions. Since the cloud needed to be handle multiple clients workload at same time and each client may have different resource requirements hence choosing proper resources for given workload in such a system. in any case. is a difficult problem. This paper addresses this streamlining issue in a cloud system with different client’s priority groups and resource requirements and proposes a bee colony based Multi-Objective load balancing technique. to attain efficient load scheduling over virtual machines under cloud.

1282490,Comparison between different classification methods with application to skin cancer,2012,Yogendra Kumar Jain and Megha Jain,53,International Journal of Computer Applications,11,,Foundation of Computer Science,In recent years. skin cancer is the most common form of human cancer. It is estimated that over 1 million new cases occur annually. In order to detect skin cancer various methods have been proposed in the past decades. This paper focuses on the development of a skin cancer screening system that can be used in a general practice by non-experts to classify normal from abnormal cases. The development process consists of Feature Detection and Classification Technique. The features are extracted by decomposing images into different frequency subbands using wavelet transform. The output of Discrete Wavelet Transform becomes input to the Classification System which classify whether the input image is cancerous or noncancerous. The classification system is based on the application of Probabilistic Neural Network and Clustering Classifier. The Accuracy of the proposed system is calculated using different classification techniques on image database of 80 samples (40 cancerous and 40 non cancerous images).,True,6tV8Ut8AAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,21,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.258.7016&rep=rep1&type=pdf,11143112826123062382,/scholar?cites=11143112826123062382,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.258.7016&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Many feature selection methods introduced to eliminate redundant and irrelevant features. because raw features may abbreviate accuracy or robustness of classification.

We reduced the features of the data set than run the algorithm. Result show that drastically decreased in learning time of the algorithm without compromising the accuracy which is desirable for good IDS.

1282511,Towards Applying Interactive POMDPs to Real-World Adversary Modeling.,2010,Brenda Ng and Carol Meyers and Kofi Boakye and John J Nitao,,,,,,We examine the suitability of using decision processes to model real-world systems of intelligent adversaries. Decision processes have long been used to study cooperative multiagent interactions. but their practical applicability to adversarial problems has received minimal study. We address the pros and cons of applying sequential decision-making in this area. using the crime of money laundering as a specific example. Motivated by case studies. we abstract out a model of the money laundering process. using the framework of interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDPs). We discuss why this framework is well suited for modeling adversarial interactions. Particle filtering and value iteration are used to solve the model. with the application of different pruning and look-ahead strategies to assess the tradeoffs between solution quality and algorithmic run time.

1282512,Text-constrained speaker recognition on a text-independent task,2004,Kofi Boakye and Barbara Peskin,,,,,,We present an approach to speaker recognition in the textindependent domain of conversational telephone speech using a text-constrained system designed to employ select highfrequency keywords in the speech stream. The system uses speaker word models generated via Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)—a departure from the traditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approach dominant in text-independent work. but commonly employed in text-dependent systems—with the expectation that HMMs take greater advantage of sequential information and support more detailed modeling which could be used to aid recognition. Even with a keyword inventory that covers a mere 10% of the word tokens and a system that does not yet incorporate many standard speaker recognition normalization schemes. this approach is already achieving equal error rates of 1% on NIST’s 2001 Extended Data task.,True,kKdJBTsAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,39,https://www.isca-speech.org/archive_open/odyssey_04/ody4_129.html,10980076370902231060,/scholar?cites=10980076370902231060,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.391.8141&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Using feature analysis. we identify the most salient features from a candidate list including those from our previous system and a set of newly proposed features. In addition. through independent optimization of overlap exclusion and labeling. we obtain a relative diarization error rate improvement of 15.1% on a sampled subset of the AMI Meeting Corpus. more than double our previous result.

However. the methods based on a single feature vector are not sufficient enough to overcome visual ambiguity. which frequently occurs in real scenario. In this paper. we propose a novel end-to-end trainable framework. called Dual ATtention Matching network (DuATM). to learn context-aware feature sequences and perform attentive sequence comparison simultaneously. The core component of our DuATM framework is a dual attention mechanism. in which both intra-sequence and inter-sequence attention strategies are used for feature refinement and feature-pair alignment. respectively. Thus. detailed visual cues contained in the intermediate feature sequences can be automatically exploited and properly compared. We train the proposed DuATM network as a siamese network via a triplet loss assisted with a de-correlation loss and a cross-entropy loss. We conduct extensive experiments on both image and video based ReID benchmark datasets.

However. it is still difficult to effectively apply deep CNNs to video object segmentation (VOS) since treating video frames as separate and static will lose the information hidden in motion. To tackle this problem. we propose a Motion-guided Cascaded Refinement Network for VOS. By assuming the object motion is normally different from the background motion. for a video frame we first apply an active contour model on optical flow to coarsely segment objects of interest. Then. the proposed Cascaded Refinement Network (CRN) takes the coarse segmentation as guidance to generate an accurate segmentation of full resolution. In this way. the motion information and the deep CNNs can well complement each other to accurately segment objects from video frames. Furthermore. in CRN we introduce a Single-channel Residual Attention Module to incorporate the coarse segmentation map as attention. making our network effective and efficient in both training and testing.

The proposed metric is extremely simple and can be implemented in four lines of Matlab code 1. The basic assumption employed by the proposed metric is that the noise should be independent of the original image. A direct measurement of this dependence is. however. impractical due to the relatively low accuracy of existing denoising method. The proposed metric thus aims at maximizing the structure similarity between the input noisy image and the estimated image noise around homogeneous regions and the structure similarity between the input noisy image and the denoised image around highly-structured regions. and is computed as the linear correlation coefficient of the two corresponding structure similarity maps. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric not only outperforms the current state-of-the-art non-reference quality metric quantitatively and qualitatively. but also better maintains temporal coherence when used for video denoising.,True,qDZvRLgAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,40,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2013/html/Kong_A_New_Image_2013_ICCV_paper.html,9096296419822917492,/scholar?cites=9096296419822917492,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2013/papers/Kong_A_New_Image_2013_ICCV_paper.pdf,0,0,0

The tone mapping function is inspired by the shunting characteristics of the center-surround cells of the Human Visual System (HVS). This function is modulated differently for every pixel. according to its surround. The surround is calculated using a new approach. based on the oriented cells of the HVS. which allows it to adapt its shape to the local contents of the image and. thus. minimize the halo effects. The method has low complexity and can render 1MPixel images in approximately 1 second when executed by a conventional PC.,True,FUsg2mAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,29,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-77129-6_45,367989541878213059,/scholar?cites=367989541878213059,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-77129-6_45.pdf,0,0,0

The method employs illumination estimation filtering. in order to assess the degree of “wellexposedness” of the pixels in the original image sequence. These initial estimations are then modulated by membership functions. which assign specific weights to the pixels of the image sequence. The membership functions favor the well-exposed pixels from each exposure. in order to maximize the visual information in the final result. The fused image is derived by interpolating between all the pixels. using the weights assigned by the membership functions. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm preserves well the information from each exposure of the sequence. resulting to an image with extended information both in the shadows and in the highlights.,True,FUsg2mAAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,28,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vassilios_Vonikakis/publication/235350562_Multi-Exposure_Image_Fusion_Based_on_Illumination_Estimation/links/54c75e0d0cf238bb7d0a7b30/Multi-Exposure-Image-Fusion-Based-on-Illumination-Estimation.pdf,13248161928069083776,/scholar?cites=13248161928069083776,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vassilios_Vonikakis/publication/235350562_Multi-Exposure_Image_Fusion_Based_on_Illumination_Estimation/links/54c75e0d0cf238bb7d0a7b30/Multi-Exposure-Image-Fusion-Based-on-Illumination-Estimation.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper an anatomical modeling and matching method is proposed to coarsely segment thoracic volume data into anatomically labeled regions. An anatomical model of the thorax is constructed in two steps: (1) individual organs are modeled with blended fuzzy implicit surfaces and (2) the single organ models are grouped into a tree structure with a solid modeling technique named constructive solid geometry (CSG).

The proposed SRI-Net is capable of accurately detecting large buildings that might be easily omitted while retaining global morphological characteristics and local details. On the other hand. to improve computational efficiency. depthwise separable convolutions and convolution factorization are introduced to significantly decrease the number of model parameters. The proposed model is evaluated on the Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset and the Wuhan University (WHU) Aerial Building Dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed methods exhibit significant improvements compared with several state-of-the-art FCNs. including SegNet. U-Net. RefineNet. and DeepLab v3+. The proposed model shows promising potential for building detection from remote sensing images on a large scale.

1282596,Sparse coding for classification via discrimination ensemble,2016,Yuhui Quan and Yong Xu and Yuping Sun and Yan Huang and Hui Ji,,,,5839-5847,,Discriminative sparse coding has emerged as a promising technique in image analysis and recognition. which couples the process of classifier training and the process of dictionary learning for improving the discriminability of sparse codes. Many existing approaches consider only a simple single linear classifier whose discriminative power is rather weak. In this paper. we proposed a discriminative sparse coding method which jointly learns a dictionary for sparse coding and an ensemble classifier for discrimination. The ensemble classifier is composed of a set of linear predictors and constructed via both subsampling on data and subspace projection on sparse codes. The advantages of the proposed method over the existing ones are multi-fold: better discriminability of sparse codes. weaker dependence on peculiarities of training data. and more expressibility of classifier for classification. These advantages are also justified in the experiments. as our method outperformed several state-of-the-art methods in several recognition tasks.,True,JpCZGn4AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,47,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Quan_Sparse_Coding_for_CVPR_2016_paper.html,16518654430775931052,/scholar?cites=16518654430775931052,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Quan_Sparse_Coding_for_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Dynamic texture (DT) is essential for understanding the video sequences with spatio-temporal similarities. This paper presents a powerful tool called dynamic fractal analysis to DT description and classification. which integrates rich description of DT with strong robustness to environmental changes. The proposed dynamic fractal spectrum (DFS) for DT sequences is composed of two components. The first one is a volumetric dynamic fractal spectrum component (V-DFS) that captures the stochastic self-similarities of DT sequences by treating them as 3D volumes; the second one is a multi-slice dynamic fractal spectrum component (S-DFS) that encodes fractal structures of repetitive DT patterns on 2D slices along different views of the 3D volume.

One often-used type of systems for sparsifying images is wavelet tight frames. which can efficiently exploit the sparse nature of local intensity variations of images. However. existing wavelet frame systems lack the capability of exploiting another important image prior. i.e.. the self-recursion of local image structures in both spatial and scale domain. Such a self-recursive prior of image structures has led to many powerful non-local image restoration schemes with impressive performance.

The low mutual coherence of a dictionary is an important property that ensures the optimality of the sparse code generated from this dictionary. Indeed. most existing dictionary learning methods for sparse coding either implicitly or explicitly tried to learn an incoherent dictionary. which requires solving a very challenging non-convex optimization problem.

The experimental results presented in this paper reveal that factors such as the various levels of oxidization of the waste materials and the slight differences in their chemical composition preclude the use of the spectral features in a simplistic manner for robust material classification. To address these problems. the proposed FUSSER (fuzzy spectral and spatial classifier) algorithm detailed in this paper merges the spectral and spatial features to obtain a combined feature vector that is able to better sample the properties of the nonferrous materials than the single pixel spectral features when applied …,True,53SVknsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,105,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5238508/,842474596508412298,/scholar?cites=842474596508412298,,,http://doras.dcu.ie/15600/1/whelan8.pdf,0,0,0

While there is no doubt that the availability of detailed spectral information is opportune as it opens the possibility to construct robust image descriptors. it also raises a substantial challenge when this high-dimensional data is used in the development of real-time machine vision systems. To alleviate the computational demand. often decorrelation techniques are commonly applied prior to feature extraction.

The only signal available in every single defibrillator and valid for the detection of pulse is the electrocardiogram (ECG). In this study we propose two deep neural network (DNN) architectures to detect pulse using short ECG segments (5 s). ie. to classify the rhythm into pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or pulse-generating rhythm (PR). A total of 3914 5-s ECG segments. 2372 PR and 1542 PEA. were extracted from 279 OHCA episodes. Data were partitioned patient-wise into training (80%) and test (20%) sets. The first DNN architecture was a fully convolutional neural network. and the second architecture added a recurrent layer to learn temporal dependencies. Both DNN architectures were tuned using Bayesian optimization. and the results for the test set were compared to state-of-the art PR/PEA discrimination algorithms based on machine learning and hand crafted features. The PR/PEA classifiers were evaluated in terms of sensitivity (Se) for PR. specificity (Sp) for PEA. and the balanced accuracy (BAC). the average of Se and Sp. The Se/Sp/BAC of the DNN architectures were 94.1%/92.9%/93.5% for the first one. and 95.5%/91.6%/93.5% for the second one. Both architectures improved the performance of state of the art methods by more than 1.5 points in BAC.

ECG feature extraction and machine learning have been successfully used to detect ventricular fibrillation (VF) in AED shock decision algorithms. Recently. deep learning architectures based on 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been proposed for this task. This study introduces a deep learning architecture based on 1D-CNN layers and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for the detection of VF. Two datasets were used. one from public repositories of Holter recordings captured at the onset of the arrhythmia. and a second from OHCA patients obtained minutes after the onset of the arrest. Data was partitioned patient-wise into training (80%) to design the classifiers. and test (20%) to report the results. The proposed architecture was compared to 1D-CNN only deep learners. and to a classical approach based on VF-detection features and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

The multiscale analysis provides information regarding parts of shapes. their axes or centers and shape skeletons. Here. the authors show that the level sets of an edge-strength function provide essentially the same shape analysis as provided by curve evolution. The new method has several advantages over the method of curve evolution. Since the governing equation is linear. the implementation is simpler and faster. The same equation applies to problems of higher dimension.

In each captured image. the segmentation takes place where pixels belonging to the hands are separated from the background based on background extraction and skin-color segmentation. A time-adaptive mixture of Gaussians is used to model the distribution of each pixel color value. For an input image. every new pixel value is checked. deciding if it matches with one of the existing Gaussians based on the distance from the mean in terms of the standard deviation. The best matching distribution parameters are updated and its weight is increased. It is assumed that the values of the background pixels have low variance and large weight. These matched pixels. considered as foreground. are compared based on skin color thresholds.

1282637,Dynamic features for iris recognition,2012,Ronaldo Martins da Costa and Adilson Gonzaga,42,"IEEE transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics, part B (cybernetics)",4,1072-1082,IEEE,The human eye is sensitive to visible light. Increasing illumination on the eye causes the pupil of the eye to contract. while decreasing illumination causes the pupil to dilate. Visible light causes specular reflections inside the iris ring. On the other hand. the human retina is less sensitive to near infra-red (NIR) radiation in the wavelength range from 800 nm to 1400 nm. but iris detail can still be imaged with NIR illumination. In order to measure the dynamic movement of the human pupil and iris while keeping the light-induced reflexes from affecting the quality of the digitalized image. this paper describes a device based on the consensual reflex. This biological phenomenon contracts and dilates the two pupils synchronously when illuminating one of the eyes by visible light.

The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of the affective decision-making on tactical behavior in soccer players under the age of 15 years old. The System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer (FUT-SAT) was used to assess tactical behavior. To evaluate affective decision-making. we used the neuropsychological test called The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). The values of the offensive. defensive and game tactical behavior of participants were used to create performance groups. The low (≤25%) and high (≥75%) groups. according to offensive. defensive and game tactical behavior. were compared and shown to be different. The values of the IGT net score of the participants with low and high tactical behavior were compared using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Statistically significant differences between the groups were observed for Defensive Tactical Behavior (Z = −3.133; p = 0.002; r = −0.355) and Game Tactical Behavior (Z = −2.267; p = 0.023; r = −0.260).

The segmentation is obtained through an automatic analysis made in the RGB and SI channels by changing from the RGB color space to the HSI color space. The aim is to determine which of the five channels have the characteristic that will make the segmentation process more efficient. After the analysis. the selected channel is segmented and used as a mask over the original image. allowing that only the inner tissues of the wound be analyzed. The analysis is done through predetermined functions that attribute membership grade for each processed pixel as well as its level of engagement in a specified tissue class.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Constructing anatomical shape from extremely sparse information is a challenging task. A priori information is often required to handle this otherwise ill-posed problem. In the present paper. we try to solve the problem in an accurate and robust way. At the heart of our approach lies the combination of a three-stage anatomical shape reconstruction technique and a dense surface point distribution model (DS-PDM). The DS-PDM is constructed from an already-aligned sparse training shape set using Loop subdivision. Its application facilitates the setup of point correspondences for all three stages of surface reconstruction due to its dense description.

1282662,Building extraction from high resolution satellite images using Hough transform,2010,D Koc San and M Turker,,,,,Copernicus Gesellschaft Mbh,An approach was developed for the automatic extraction of the rectangular and circular shaped buildings from high resolution satellite imagery using Hough transform. First. the candidate building patches are detected from the imagery using the binary Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification technique. In addition to original image bands. the bands NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). and nDSM (normalized Digital Surface Model) are also used in the classification. After detecting the building patches. their edges are detected using the Canny edge detection algorithm. The edge image is then converted into vector form using the Hough transform. which is a widely used technique for extracting the lines or curves of the objects. The vector lines and curves that represent the building edges are grouped based on perceptual groupings. and the building boundaries are constructed.

1282676,Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization through Contrast based Evaluation Networks,2019,Ziyi Liu and Le Wang and Qilin Zhang and Zhanning Gao and Zhenxing Niu and Zheng Nanning and Gang Hua,,,,,,Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL) is a promising but challenging task with only video-level action categorical labels available during training. Without requiring temporal action boundary annotations in training data. WS-TAL could possibly exploit automatically retrieved video tags as video-level labels. However. such coarse video-level supervision inevitably incurs confusions. especially in untrimmed videos containing multiple action instances. To address this challenge. we propose the Contrast-based Localization EvaluAtioN Network (CleanNet) with our new action proposal evaluator. which provides pseudo-supervision by leveraging the temporal contrast in snippet-level action classification predictions. Essentially. the new action proposal evaluator enforces an additional temporal contrast constraint so that high-evaluation-score action proposals are more likely to coincide with true action instances. Moreover. the new action localization module is an integral part of CleanNet which enables end-to-end training.

1282677,Knowledge-based topic model for unsupervised object discovery and localization,2018,Zhenxing Niu and Gang Hua and Le Wang and Xinbo Gao,27,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (T-IP),1,50-63,IEEE,Unsupervised object discovery and localization is to discover some dominant object classes and localize all of object instances from a given image collection without any supervision. Previous work has attempted to tackle this problem with vanilla topic models. such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). However. in those methods no prior knowledge for the given image collection is exploited to facilitate object discovery. On the other hand. the topic models used in those methods suffer from the topic coherence issue-some inferred topics do not have clear meaning. which limits the final performance of object discovery. In this paper. prior knowledge in terms of the so-called must-links are exploited from Web images on the Internet. Furthermore. a novel knowledge-based topic model. called LDA with mixture of Dirichlet trees. is proposed to incorporate the must-links into topic modeling for object discovery.

1282678,Action Recognition by an Attention-aware Temporal Weighted Convolutional Neural Network,2018,Le Wang and Jinliang Zang and Qilin Zhang and Zhenxing Niu and Gang Hua and Nanning Zheng,18,Sensors,7,1979,,Research in human action recognition has accelerated significantly since the introduction of powerful machine learning tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However. effective and efficient methods for incorporation of temporal information into CNNs are still being actively explored in the recent literature. Motivated by the popular recurrent attention models in the research area of natural language processing. we propose the Attention-aware Temporal Weighted CNN (ATW CNN) for action recognition in videos. which embeds a visual attention model into a temporal weighted multi-stream CNN. This attention model is simply implemented as temporal weighting yet it effectively boosts the recognition performance of video representations. Besides. each stream in the proposed ATW CNN framework is capable of end-to-end training. with both network parameters and temporal weights optimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with back-propagation. Our experimental results on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets showed that the proposed attention mechanism contributes substantially to the performance gains with the more discriminative snippets by focusing on more relevant video segments.

Compared to LiDAR systems. the inexpensive vision sensors can capture the 3D scene as perceived by a driver in terms of appearance and depth cues. Indeed. providing 3D image understanding capabilities to vehicles is an essential target in order to infer scene semantics in urban environments. One of the challenges that arises from the navigation task in naturalistic urban scenarios is the detection of road participants (eg. cyclists. pedestrians and vehicles). In this regard. this paper tackles the detection and orientation estimation of cars. pedestrians and cyclists. employing the challenging and naturalistic KITTI images. This work proposes 3D-aware features computed from stereo color images in order to capture the appearance and depth peculiarities of the objects in road scenes. The successful part-based object detector. known as DPM. is extended to learn richer models from the 2.5 D data (color and disparity). while also carrying out a detailed analysis of the training pipeline. A large set of experiments evaluate the proposals. and the best performing approach is ranked on the KITTI website. Indeed. this is the first work that reports results with stereo data for the KITTI object challenge. achieving increased detection ratios for the classes car and cyclist compared to a baseline DPM.

Recently. anatomists succeeded in photographing the Purkinje fibers of a sheep. which clearly showed the mesh structure of the Purkinje fibers. In this study. we present a technique for modeling the mesh structure of Purkinje fibers semiautomatically using an extended L-system. The L-system is a formal grammar that defines the growth of a fractal structure by generating rules (or rewriting rules) and an initial structure. It was originally formulated to describe the growth of plant cells. and has subsequently been applied for various purposes in computer graphics such as modeling plants. buildings. streets. and ornaments. For our purpose. we extended the growth process of the L-system as follows: 1) each growing branch keeps away from existing branches as much as possible to create a uniform distribution. and 2) when branches collide. we connect the colliding branches to construct a closed mesh structure. We designed a generating rule based on observations of the photograph of Purkinje fibers and manually specified three terminal positions on a three-dimensional (3D) heart model: those of the right bundle branch. the anterior fascicle. and the left posterior fascicle of the left branch. Then. we grew fibers starting from each of the three positions based on the specified generating rule.

1282697,Surface-based growth simulation for opening flowers,2008,Takashi Ijiri and Mihoshi Yokoo and Saneyuki Kawabata and Takeo Igarashi,,,,227-234,,We propose a biologically motivated method for creating animations of opening flowers. We simulate the development of petals based on the observation that flower opening is mainly caused by cell expansion. We use an elastic triangular mesh to represent a petal and emulate its growth by developing each triangular region. Our simulation process consists of two steps. The system first grows each triangle independently according to user-specified parameters and derives target rest edge lengths and dihedral angles. The system then updates the global shape to satisfy the rest lengths and dihedral angles as much as possible by means of energy minimization. We repeat these two processes to obtain keyframes of the flower opening animation. Our system can generate an animation in about 11.5 minutes. Applications include the creation of graphics animations. designing 3D plant models. and simulation for aiding biological study. In contrast to existing systems that simulate the development of flattened 2D petals. our system simulates the growth of petals as 3D surfaces.

Although a CT system provides volume data that captures the internal structures of flowers. it is difficult to accurately segment them into regions of particular organs and model them as smooth surfaces because a flower consists of thin organs that contact one another. We thus introduce a semi-automatic modeling technique that is based on a new active contour model with energy functionals designed for flower CT. Our key idea is to approximate flower components by two important primitives. a shaft and a sheet. Based on our active contour model. we also provide novel user interfaces and a numerical scheme to fit these primitives so as to reconstruct realistic thin flower organs efficiently.

Our technique is based on an implicit surface reconstruction strategy. whereby a signed scalar field is generated from user‐specified contours. The key idea is to compute the scalar field in a joint spatial‐range domain (i.e.. bilateral domain) and resample its values on an image manifold. We introduce a new formulation of Hermite radial basis function (HRBF) interpolation to obtain the scalar field in the bilateral domain. In contrast to previous implicit methods. bilateral HRBF (B‐HRBF) generates a segmentation boundary that passes through all contours. fits high‐contrast image edges if they exist. and has a smooth shape in blurred areas of images.

However. most existing methods require enormous computational costs and often show unstable behavior for extreme parameter sets. which interrupts smooth simulation study and make it difficult to apply them to interactive applications. To address this issue. we present an efficient and robust framework for simulating the cardiac beating motion. The global cardiac motion is generated by the accumulation of local myocardial fiber contractions. We compute such local-to-global deformations using a kinematic approach; we divide a heart mesh model into overlapping local regions. contract them independently according to fiber orientation. and compute a global shape that satisfies contracted shapes of all local regions as much as possible. A comparison between our method and a physics-based method showed that our method can generate motion very close to that of a physics-based simulation. Our kinematic method has high controllability; the simulated ventricle-wall-contraction speed can be easily adjusted to that of a real heart by controlling local contraction timing. We demonstrate that our method achieves a highly realistic beating motion of a whole heart in real time on a consumer-level computer. Our method provides an important step to bridge a gap between cardiac simulations and interactive applications.,True,jabR9ysAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,26,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036706,16710872755937004563,/scholar?cites=16710872755937004563,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036706,0,0,0

Accordingly. the contribution of texture alone to risk assessment is not known. Here background intensity independent texture measures are used to assess cancer risk.

It is the utility-based itemset mining approach to find itemsets conforming to user preferences. Modern research in mining high-utility itemsets (HUI) from the databases faces two major challenges: exponential search space and database-dependent minimum utility threshold. The search space is extremely vast when the number of distinct items and the size of the database are very large. Data analysts must specify suitable minimum utility thresholds for their mining tasks. although they might have no knowledge pertaining to their databases. Moreover. a utility-mining algorithm supports only an itemset with positive item values.

The term “clustering” is used in several research communities to describe methods for grouping of unlabeled data. These communities have different terminologies and assumptions for the components of the clustering process and the context in which clustering is used. This paper looks into the use of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for cluster analysis. In standard PSO the non-oscillatory route can quickly cause a particle to stagnate and also it may prematurely converge on suboptimal solutions that are not even guaranteed to local optimal solution. In this paper a modification strategy is proposed for the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and applied in the data sets. This paper provides a method for particles to steer clear off from local stagnation and the local search is applied to improve the goodness of fitting. The effectiveness of this concept is demonstrated by cluster analysis.

In the paper. two classes of divergence measures inspired by classical prediction theory are introduced. These divergences naturally induce Riemannian metrics on the cone of multivariable densities. The metrics amount to the quadratic term in the divergence between “infinitesimally close to each other” power spectra. For one of the two we provide explicit formulae for the corresponding geodesics and geodesic distance. A close connection between the geometry of power spectra and the geometry of the Fisher-Rao metric is noted.,True,-nkHUV0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,60,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6125231/,12459021577718631361,/scholar?cites=12459021577718631361,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.1345,0,0,0

Standard dMRI acquisitions facilitate a proper analysis (e.g. tracing) of medium-to-large white matter bundles. However. smaller fiber bundles connecting very small cortical or sub-cortical regions cannot be traced accurately in images with large voxel sizes. Yet. the ability to trace such fiber bundles is critical for several applications such as deep brain stimulation and neurosurgery. In this work. we propose a novel acquisition and reconstruction scheme for obtaining high spatial resolution dMRI images using multiple low resolution (LR) images. which is effective in reducing acquisition time while improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Thus. proper harmonization of such data sets is necessary to increase the sample size and thereby the statistical power of neuroimaging studies. In this paper. we present a novel approach to harmonize dMRI data (the raw signal. instead of dMRI derived measures such as fractional anisotropy) using rotation invariant spherical harmonic (RISH) features embedded within a multi-modal image registration framework. All dMRI data sets from all sites are registered to a common template and voxel-wise differences in RISH features between sites at a group level are used to harmonize the signal in a subject-specific manner.

However. dMRI data sets acquired on multiple scanners cannot be naively pooled for joint analysis due to scanner specific nonlinear effects as well as differences in acquisition parameters. Consequently. for joint analysis. the dMRI data has to be harmonized. which involves removing scanner-specific differences from the raw dMRI signal. In this work. we propose a dMRI harmonization method that is capable of removing scanner-specific effects. while accounting for minor differences in acquisition parameters such as b-value. spatial resolution and number of gradient directions.

Our aim is to devise a geometry which is suitable for comparing power spectral densities of multivariable time series. More specifically. the value of a power spectral density at a given frequency. which in the matricial case encodes power as well as directionality. is thought of as a proxy for a “matrix-valued mass density.” Optimal transport aims at establishing a natural metric in the space of such matrix-valued densities which takes into account differences between power across frequencies as well as misalignment of the corresponding principle axes. Thus. our transportation cost includes a cost of transference of power between frequencies together with a cost of rotating the principle directions of matrix densities.

As such. it is imperative to derive an accurate estimate of the EAP from the acquired diffusion data. In this work. we propose a novel method for estimating the EAP by representing the diffusion signal as a linear combination of directional radial basis functions scattered in q-space. In particular. we focus on a special case of anisotropic Gaussian basis functions and derive analytical expressions for the diffusion orientation distribution function (ODF). the return-to-origin probability (RTOP). and mean-squared-displacement (MSD). A significant advantage of the proposed method is that the second and the fourth order moment tensors of the EAP can be computed explicitly.

However. inter-scanner and inter-protocol differences are known to induce significant measurement variability. which in turn jeopardises the ability to obtain ‘truly quantitative measures’ and challenges the reliable combination of different datasets. Combining datasets from different scanners and/or acquired at different time points could dramatically increase the statistical power of clinical studies. and facilitate multi-centre research.

A challenging task is to identify and diagnose the behavior of such systems. which aim to produce a product with desired quality. In order to control the state of the systems. various information is gathered from different types of sensors (optical. acoustic. chemical. electric. and thermal). Time series data are a set of real‐valued variables obtained chronologically. Data mining and machine learning help derive meaningful knowledge from time series. Such tasks include clustering. classification. anomaly detection and motif discovery. Motif discovery attempts to find meaningful. new. and unknown knowledge from data.

1282760,Towards distributed intelligent sensor and information fusion,2016,Uwe Mönks and Henning Trsek and Lars Dürkop and Volker Geneiß and Volker Lohweg,34,Mechatronics,,63-71,Pergamon,Recent industrial applications are implemented in a modular way. resulting in flexibility during the whole life cycle. i.e.. setup. operation. and maintenance. This applies especially to larger applications like logistic. production. and printing processes. Their modular character is resulting from the constantly increasing complexity of such installations. which makes their supervision for securing reliable operation a difficult task: the data of hundreds (if not thousands) of signal sources must be acquired. communicated. and evaluated for system diagnosis. In this contribution we summarize the challenges arising in such applications and show that distributed sensor and information fusion for modular self-diagnosis tackles these challenges.

An active field of research is the implementation of monitoring and control at sub-system level using cognitive approaches. In this paper we present a method for autonomous and sensorless condition monitoring of an electric drive train. Based on experiment design we measured phase currents of a physical demonstrator device including mechanical defects and extracted signal features using proper orthogonal decomposition. In favor of classification of different defect states we performed a linear discriminant analysis. which yields appropriate data for a Fuzzy-Pattern-Classification algorithm. As a result we were able to identify different reference defect states as well as previously unknown states.,True,ssNAS6MAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,29,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6648126/,14836123763642369986,/scholar?cites=14836123763642369986,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martyna_Bator/publication/261282496_Sensorless_drive_diagnosis_using_automated_feature_extraction_significance_ranking_and_reduction/links/00b4953b12d4815e04000000/Sensorless-drive-diagnosis-using-automated-feature-extraction-significance-ranking-and-reduction.pdf,0,0,0

Berlin. Heidelberg,Segmentation and feature extraction algorithms based on Wavelet Transform or Wavelet Packet Transform are established in pattern recognition. Especially in the field of texture analysis they are known to be practical. One difficulty of texture analysis was in the past the characterization of different printing processes. In this paper we present a new algorithmic concept to feature extraction of textures. printed by different printing techniques. without the necessity of a previous teaching phase. The typical characters of distinct printed textures are extracted by first order statistical moments of wavelet coefficients. The algorithm uses the 2D incomplete shift invariant Wavelet Packet Transform. resulting in a fast execution time of O(Nlog2(N)). Since the incomplete shift invariant Wavelet Packet Transform was exclusively defined for 1D-signals. it has been modified in this research.

Modern facilities create such a large amount of complex data that a machine operator is unable to comprehend and process the information contained in the data. Thus. information fusion mechanisms gain increasing importance. Besides the management of large amounts of data. further challenges towards the fusion algorithms arise from epistemic uncertainties (incomplete knowledge) in the input signals as well as conflicts between them. These aspects must be considered during information processing to obtain reliable results. which are in accordance with the real world. The analysis of the scientific state of the art shows that current solutions fulfil said requirements at most only partly. This article proposes the multilayered information fusion system MACRO (multilayer attribute-based conflict-reducing observation) employing the μ BalTLCS (fuzzified balanced two-layer conflict solving) fusion algorithm to reduce the impact of conflicts on the fusion result. The performance of the contribution is shown by its evaluation in the scope of a machine condition monitoring application under laboratory conditions.

We present a method for automated anatomical labeling of the CoW by detecting its main bifurcations. The CoW is modeled as rooted attributed relational graph. with bifurcations as its vertices. whose attributes are characterized as points on a Riemannian manifold. The method is first trained on a set of pre-labeled examples. where it learns the variability of local bifurcation features as well as the variability in the topology.

In order for the method to be fully automatic. the landmarks used for the registration are detected using a number of image processing algorithms.

They can create major disturbances in the interplanetary medium and trigger severe magnetic storms when they collide with the Earth's magnetosphere. It is important to know their real speed. propagation direction and 3-D configuration in order to accurately predict their arrival time at the Earth. Using data from the SECCHI coronagraphs onboard the STEREO mission. which was launched in October 2006. we can infer the propagation direction and the 3-D structure of such events. In this review. we first describe different techniques that were used to model the 3-D configuration of CMEs in the coronagraph field of view (up to 15 R⊙).

Due to the intrinsic multiscale nature of features in coronagraph images. wavelet and multiscale image processing techniques are well suited to enhancing the visibility of CMEs and suppressing noise.

Due to the dynamic nature of the problem. some sequential estimation algorithms like particle filters are usually applied to visual tracking. Unfortunately. particle filter fails in high dimensional estimation problems such as articulated objects or multiple object tracking. These problems are called\emph {dynamic optimization problems}. Metaheuristics. which are high level general strategies for designing heuristics procedures. have emerged for solving many real world combinatorial problems as a way to efficiently and effectively exploring the problem search space. Path relinking (PR) and scatter search (SS) are evolutionary metaheuristics successfully applied to several hard optimization problems. PRPF and SSPF algorithms respectively hybridize both. particle filter and these two population-based metaheuristic schemes. In this paper. We present and compare two different hybrid algorithms called Path Relinking Particle Filter (PRPF) and Scatter Search Particle Filter (SSPF). applied to 2D human motion tracking. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms increase the performance of standard particle filters.,True,8P4mEk8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,30,https://elcvia.cvc.uab.es/article/view/107,7950888167155380266,/scholar?cites=7950888167155380266,,,https://elcvia.cvc.uab.es/article/viewFile/107/102,0,0,0

In fact. this was shown by means of the uncorrected CM30 Special Tübingen transmission electron microscope (TEM). revealing. after numerical aberration correction. a resolution of approximately 0.1 nm. both in amplitude and phase.

The reason is that the limited coherent electron current. given by gun brightness. has to illuminate a width of at least four times the point-spread function given by the aberrations. As. using the hardware corrector. the point-spread function shrinks considerably. the current density increases and the signal-to-noise ratio improves correspondingly.

In order to measure the object areas of interest in a hologram. both a wide field of view and a sufficient lateral resolution are required. The usual path of rays for recording holograms with an electron biprism using the standard objective lens does not meet these requirements. because the field of view amounts to some 10 nm only. however. at a resolution of 0.1 nm better than needed here. Therefore. instead of the standard objective lens. the Lorentz lens is widely used for holography of semiconductors. since it provides a field of view up to 1000 nm at a sufficient lateral resolution of about 10 nm. Since the size of semiconductor structures is steadily shrinking. there is now a need for better lateral resolution at an appropriate field of view.

Samples containing only monomers or only trimers can be stabilized by respectively low and high salt. The trimers bind RNA with high affinity but remain trimmers. whereas the monomers polymerise onto RNA forming nucleoprotein-RNA complexes. When wild type (wt) nucleoprotein is crystallized. it forms trimers. whether one starts with monomers or trimers. We therefore crystallized the obligate monomeric R416A mutant nucleoprotein and observed how the domain exchange loop that leads over to a neighbouring protomer in the trimer structure interacts with equivalent sites on the mutant monomer surface. avoiding polymerisation. The C-terminus of the monomer is bound to the side of the RNA binding surface. lowering its positive charge. Biophysical characterization of the mutant and wild type monomeric proteins gives the same results. suggesting that the exchange domain is folded in the same way for the wild type protein. In a search for how monomeric wt nucleoprotein may be stabilized in the infected cell we determined the phosphorylation sites on nucleoprotein isolated from virus particles. We found that serine 165 was phosphorylated and conserved in all influenza A and B viruses. The S165D mutant that mimics phosphorylation is monomeric and displays a lowered affinity for RNA compared with wt monomeric NP. This suggests that phosphorylation may regulate the polymerisation state and RNA binding of nucleoprotein in the infected cell.

These large. multi-domain proteins are characterized by a broad-spectrum bait region and an internal thioester. which. upon cleavage. becomes covalently associated to the target protease. allowing its entrapment by a large conformational modification. Notably. α2Ms are part of a larger protein superfamily that includes proteins of the complement system. such as C3. a multi-domain macromolecule which is also characterized by an internal thioester-carrying domain and whose activation represents the pivotal step in the complement cascade. Recently. α2M/C3-like genes were identified in a large number of bacterial genomes. and the Escherichia coli α2M homolog (ECAM) was shown to be activated by proteases. In this work. we have structurally characterized ECAM by electron microscopy and small angle scattering (SAXS) techniques. ECAM is an elongated. flexible molecule with overall similarities to C3 in its inactive form; activation by methylamine. chymotrypsin. or elastase induces a conformational modification reminiscent of the one undergone by the transformation of C3 into its active form.

This paper presents a new method for thresholding images of historical documents. The main objective is to create monochromatic images with high quality at low processing time. This allows easier access to the contents of the image files. One important problem arises when the document is written on both sides of the paper. The thresholding process can lose the contents of the document completely if the separation between the ink and the background is not correctly defined.

Therefore. this paper firstly introduces the concept of negative correction inspired by the practical application of photographic developing and a fast image dehazing algorithm is accordingly proposed. Based on the observation of the photographic developing. we find that the contrast of images can be enlarged and their saturation can also be increased when their negative images (or reverse image) are rectified.

However since illumination estimation is an ill-posed problem it is difficult to achieve accurate illumination estimation for nonuniform illumination images. The conventional illumination estimation algorithms fail to comprehensively take all the constraints into the consideration such as spatial smoothness sharp edges on illumination boundaries and limited range of illumination. Thus these algorithms cannot effectively and efficiently estimate illumination while preserving naturalness.

Not really!—Pedestrian detection with scale-aware localization policy,2018,Xiaowei Zhang and Li Cheng and Bo Li and Hai-Miao Hu,27,IEEE transactions on image processing,8,3703-3715,IEEE,A major bottleneck of pedestrian detection lies on the sharp performance deterioration in the presence of small-size pedestrians that are relatively far from the camera. Motivated by the observation that pedestrians of disparate spatial scales exhibit distinct visual appearances. we propose in this paper an active pedestrian detector that explicitly operates over multiple-layer neuronal representations of the input still image. More specifically. convolutional neural nets. such as ResNet and faster R-CNNs. are exploited to provide a rich and discriminative hierarchy of feature representations. as well as initial pedestrian proposals. Here each pedestrian observation of distinct size could be best characterized in terms of the ResNet feature representation at a certain layer of the hierarchy.

Due to the adverse atmospheric conditions. the scattering properties of foggy images depend on not only the depth information of scene but also the atmospheric aerosol model. which has a more prominent influence on illumination in a fog scene than that in a haze scene. However. the recent defogging methods confuse haze and fog. and they fail to consider fully the scattering properties. Thus. these methods are not sufficient to remove fog effects. especially for images in maritime surveillance.

Our approach is based on a statistical representation of fabric patterns using the redundant contourlet transform (RCT). The distribution of the RCT coefficients are modeled using a finite mixture of generalized Gaussians (MoGG). which constitute statistical signatures distinguishing between defective and defect-free fabrics. In addition to being compact and fast to compute. these signatures enable accurate localization of defects. Our defect detection system is based on three main steps. In the first step. a preprocessing is applied for detecting basic pattern size for image decomposition and signature calculation. In the second step. labeled fabric samples are used to train a Bayes classifier (BC) to discriminate between defect-free and defective fabrics.

Such anomalous values give useful information to the data analyst in discovering useful patterns. Through isolation. these data may be separated and analyzed. The analysis of outliers and influential points is an important step of the regression diagnostics. In this paper. our aim is to detect the points which are very different from the others points. They do not seem to belong to a particular population and behave differently. If these influential points are to be removed it will lead to a different model. Distinction between these points is not always obvious and clear. Hence several indicators are used for identifying and analyzing outliers. Existing methods of outlier detection are based on manual inspection of graphically represented data. In this paper. we present a new approach in automating the process of detecting and isolating outliers.

1283013,Music score binarization based on domain knowledge,2011,Telmo Pinto and Ana Rebelo and Gilson Giraldi and Jaime S Cardoso,,,,700-708,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Image binarization is a common operation in the pre- processing stage in most Optical Music Recognition (OMR) systems. The choice of an appropriate binarization method for handwritten music scores is a difficult problem. Several works have already evaluated the performance of existing binarization processes in diverse applications. However. no goal-directed studies for music sheets documents were carried out. This paper presents a novel binarization method based in the content knowledge of the image. The method only needs the estimation of the staffline thickness and the vertical distance between two stafflines. This information is extracted directly from the gray level music score. The proposed binarization procedure is experimentally compared with several state of the art methods.,True,-OFNeCoAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,44,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21257-4_87,13196063989076367203,/scholar?cites=13196063989076367203,,,http://repositorio.uportu.pt:8080/bitstream/11328/2484/1/2011TPintoIbPRIA.pdf,0,0,0

Most OMR algorithms rely on an estimation of the staff line thickness and the vertical line distance within the same staff. Subsequent operation can use these values as references. dismissing the need for some predetermined threshold values.

1283018,Staff line detection and removal in the grayscale domain,2013,Ana Rebelo and Jaime S Cardoso,,,,57-61,IEEE,The detection of staff lines is the first step of most Optical Music Recognition (OMR) systems. Its great significance derives from the ease with which we can then proceed with the extraction of musical symbols. All OMR tasks are usually achieved using binary images by setting thresholds that can be local or global. These techniques however. may remove relevant information of the music sheet and introduce artifacts which will degrade results in the later stages of the process. It arises therefore a need to create a method that reduces the loss of information due to the binarization. The baseline for the methodology proposed in this paper follows the shortest path algorithm proposed in [CardosoTPAMI08]. The concept of strong staff pixels (SSP's). which is a set of pixels with a high probability of belonging to a staff line. is proposed to guide the cost function.

The method utilizes the strain impacted on the facial skin due to the non-rigid motion caused during expressions.

The VISER system incorporates a large set of low-level features that capture appearance. color. motion. audio. and audio-visual cooccurrence patterns in videos. For the low-level features. we rigorously analyzed several coding and pooling strategies. and also used state-of-the-art spatio-temporal pooling strategies to model relationships between different features. The system also uses high-level (ie. semantic) visual information obtained from detecting scene. object. and action concepts.

These diverse streams of information are combined into a single. fixed dimensional vector for each video. We explored two different combination strategies: early fusion and late fusion. Early fusion was implemented through a fast kernel-based fusion framework and late fusion was performed using both Bayesian model combination (BAYCOM) as well as an innovative a weighted-average framework.

Nerves were automatically traced with an algorithm previously developed. and a tortuosity measure was computed with the proposed method. based on the number of changes in the curvature sign and on the amplitude (maximum distance of the curve from the underlying chord) of the nerve curves.

This classification was also compared with measures provided by other methods proposed in the literature to evaluate nerve tortuosity.Results.: Among all considered methods. the one proposed herein allows a minimum of classification errors (only 2 in 30 images) and the highest Krippendorff concordance coefficient (0.96).

We examined a group of sporadic ALS patients with corneal confocal microscopy. a recently developed imaging technique allowing in vivo observation of corneal small sensory fibers. Corneal confocal microscopy examination revealed a reduction of corneal small fiber sensory nerve number and branching in ALS patients. Quantitative analysis demonstrated an increase in tortuosity and reduction in length and fractal dimension of ALS patients’ corneal nerve fibers compared to age-matched controls. Moreover. bulbar function disability scores were significantly related to measures of corneal nerve fibers anatomical damage.

Many techniques have been devised to tackle such a diversity of applications. Despite the long tradition of pattern recognition research. there is no technique that yields the best classification in all scenarios. Therefore. as many techniques as possible should be considered in high accuracy applications. Typical related works either focus on the performance of a given algorithm or compare various classification methods.

Actually. the adequate choice of classifiers and parameters in such practical circumstances constitutes a long-standing problem and is one of the subjects of the current paper. We carried out a performance study of nine well-known classifiers implemented in the Weka framework and compared the influence of the parameter configurations on the accuracy. The default configuration of parameters in Weka was found to provide near optimal performance for most cases. not including methods such as the support vector machine (SVM).

In addition. we also evaluated the sensitivity of the clustering methods with regard to their parameters configuration. The results revealed that. when considering the default configurations of the adopted methods. the spectral approach tended to present particularly good performance. We also found that the default configuration of the adopted implementations was not always accurate. In these cases. a simple approach based on random selection of parameters values proved to be a good alternative to improve the performance. All in all. the reported approach provides subsidies guiding the choice of clustering algorithms.,True,Ga--4bsAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,145,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210236,2509939591200642660,/scholar?cites=2509939591200642660,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210236,0,0,0

While the effect of neural activity on cerebral blood flow has been extensively studied. whether or not neural activity influences vascular patterning remains elusive. Here. we demonstrate that neural activity promotes the formation of vascular networks in the early postnatal mouse barrel cortex. Using a combination of genetics. imaging. and computational tools to allow simultaneous analysis of neuronal and vascular components. we found that vascular density and branching were decreased in the barrel cortex when sensory input was reduced by either a complete deafferentation. a genetic impairment of neurotransmitter release at thalamocortical synapses. or a selective reduction of sensory-related neural activity by whisker plucking. In contrast. enhancement of neural activity by whisker stimulation led to an increase in vascular density and …,True,Ga--4bsAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,85,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731400645X,14192827166742819567,/scholar?cites=14192827166742819567,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731400645X,0,0,0

Although there are many existing alternative measures for quantifying the structural properties of undirected graphs. there are relatively few corresponding measures for directed graphs. To fill this gap in the literature. we explore an alternative technique that is applicable to directed graphs. We commence by using Chung's generalization of the Laplacian of a directed graph to extend the computation of von Neumann entropy from undirected to directed graphs. We provide a simplified form of the entropy which can be expressed in terms of simple node in-degree and out-degree statistics. Moreover. we find approximate forms of the von Neumann entropy that apply to both weakly and strongly directed graphs. and that can be used to characterize network structure.

Commencing from a representation of graph structure based on a characteristic polynomial computed from the normalized Laplacian matrix. we show how the polynomial is linked to the Boltzmann partition function of a network. This allows us to compute a number of thermodynamic quantities for the network. including the average energy and entropy. Assuming that the system does not change volume. we can also compute the temperature. defined as the rate of change of entropy with energy.

At the heart of the system lies the stock exchange mechanism. which establishes a time-evolving network of trades among companies and individuals. Such network can be inferred through correlations between time series of companies stock prices. allowing the overall system to be characterized by techniques borrowed from network science. Here we study the presence of communities in the inferred stock market network. and show that the knowledge about the communities alone can provide a nearly complete representation of the system topology. This is done by defining a simple null model. a randomized version of the studied network sharing only the sizes and interconnectivity between communities observed. We show that many topological characteristics of the inferred networks are carried over the networks generated by the null model. In particular. we find that in periods of instability. such as during a financial crisis. the network strays away from a state of well-defined community structure to a much more uniform topological organization. We show that the framework presented here provides a good null model representation of topological variations taking place in the market during crises.

Using a knockin mouse strain (CbpS436A) where the aPKC-CBP pathway was defective. we show that disruption of the aPKC-CBP pathway in a murine focal ischemic stroke model increases the reprogramming efficiency of ischemia-activated pericytes (i-pericytes) to neural precursors.

Reiterations of endothelial-tip-cell selection. sprout extension and anastomosis are the basis for vascular network generation. a process governed by the VEGF/Notch feedback loop. Here. we find that temporal regulation of this feedback loop. a previously unexplored dimension. is the key mechanism to determine vascular density. Iterating between computational modeling and in vivo live imaging. we demonstrate that the rate of tip-cell selection determines the length of linear sprout extension at the expense of branching. dictating network density. We provide the first example of a host tissue-derived signal (Semaphorin3E-Plexin-D1) that accelerates tip cell selection rate. yielding a dense network.

New York. NY 10001. USA India,Isolated handwritten character recognition has been the subject of intensive research during last decades because it is useful in wide range of real world problems. It also provides a solution for processing large volumes of data automatically. Work has been done in recognizing handwritten characters in many languages like Chinese. Arabic. Devnagari. Urdu and English. The work presented in this thesis. focuses on the problem of recognition of isolated handwritten characters in Gurmukhi script. The whole process consists of two stages. The first. feature extraction stage analyzes the set of isolated characters and selects a set of features that can be used to uniquely identify characters. The performance of recognition system depends heavily on what features are being used.The selection of stable and representative set of features is the heart of recognition system. The feature extraction method Zoning. is used for extracting features of the character under consideration in this problem. In Zoning method. the frame containing the character is divided into several overlapping or non-overlapping zones and the densities of object pixels in each zone are calculated. Densities are used to form a representation. The final. classification stage is the main decision making stage of the recognition system.

However. the adaptive version of lifting schemes can result in strongly non-isometric transforms.

In this paper we focus on the problem of evaluating the reconstruction distortion (due to quantization noise) in the wavelet domain when a non-isometric adaptive-prediction lifting scheme is used. The problem arises since these transforms are nonlinear. and so common techniques for distortion evaluation cannot be used in this case.

By coinjection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs into one-cell-stage embryos. we successfully achieve precise gene targeting in cynomolgus monkeys. We also show that this system enables simultaneous disruption of two target genes (Ppar-γ and Rag1) in one step. and no off-target mutagenesis was detected by comprehensive analysis.

In most of the current steganography techniques. information hiding modifies almost all the cover image. which may negatively affect the visual quality of the image and increase the possibility of losing data after the possible attacks. To solve such a problem. this paper presents a new region based steganography technique. which hides data in the robust regions of the image. Two promising approaches have been used to detect the robust regions in the image: Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF). The robustness of the two algorithms has been tested against different types of attacks. Results showed that SURF based algorithm is better when detecting the robust regions correctly.

The sensor takes advantage of the interference effect between the fiber’s first two propagation modes along the taper waist region. The biomolecules bonded on the taper surface were determined by demodulating the transmission spectrum phase shift. Because of the sharp spectrum fringe signals. as well as a relatively long biomolecule testing region. the sensor displayed a fast response and was highly sensitive. To better understand the influence of various biomolecules on the sensor. a numerical simulation that varied biolayer parameters such as thickness and refractive index was performed. The results showed that the spectrum fringe shift was obvious to be measured even when the biolayer was only nanometers thick. A microchannel chip was designed and fabricated for the protection of the sensor and biotesting. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication techniques were used to precisely control the profile and depth of the microchannel on the silicon chip with an accuracy of 2 μm. A tapered optical fiber biosensor was fabricated and evaluated with an Immune globulin G (IgG) antibody-antigen pair.

The sensor’s FP cavity was fabricated by aligning two metal-deposited. single-mode optical fiber endfaces inside a microchannel on a silicon chip. The mirrors on the fiber endfaces were made of thermal-deposited metal films. which provided the high finesse necessary to produce a highly sensitive sensor. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication techniques. specifically photolithography and deep dry etching. were used to precisely control the profile and depth of the microchannel on the silicon chip with an accuracy of 2 μm. The RI change within the FP cavity was determined by demodulating the transmission spectrum phase shift. The sensitivity and finesse of the transmission spectrum were controlled by adjusting the cavity length and the thickness of the deposited metal. Our experimental results showed that the sensor’s sensitivity was 665.90 nm/RIU (RI Unit). and the limit of detection was 6× 10− 6 RIU. Using MEMS fabrication techniques to fabricate these sensors could make high yield mass production a real possibility.

In this paper. we propose an algorithm to extract objects which attract visual attention from videos. As human attention is naturally biased towards high level semantic objects in visual scenes. this information can be valuable to extract salient objects. The proposed algorithm extracts dominant visual tracks using eye tracking data from multiple subjects on a video sequence by a combination of mean-shift clustering and Hungarian algorithm. These visual tracks guide a generic object search algorithm to get candidate object locations and extents in every frame. Further. we propose a novel multiple object extraction algorithm by constructing a spatio-temporal mixed graph over object candidates. Bounding box based object extraction inference is performed using binary linear integer programming on a cost function defined over the graph. Finally. the object boundaries are refined using grabcut segmentation.

The goal is to assign pixel-level labels given only partial information. for example. image-level labels. This is an important problem in many application scenarios where it is difficult to get accurate segmentation or not feasible to obtain detailed annotations. The proposed approach starts with an initial coarse segmentation. followed by a spectral clustering approach that groups related image parts into communities. A community-driven graph is then constructed that captures spatial and feature relationships between communities while a label graph captures correlations between image labels. Finally. mapping the image level labels to appropriate communities is formulated as a convex optimization problem. The proposed approach does not require location information for image level labels and can be trained using partially labeled datasets.

In this paper we explore a novel problem of predicting face and text regions in images using eye tracking data from multiple subjects. The problem is challenging as we aim to predict the semantics (face/text/background) only from eye tracking data without utilizing any image information. The proposed algorithm spatially clusters eye tracking data obtained in an image into different coherent groups and subsequently models the likelihood of the clusters containing faces and text using a fully connected Markov Random Field (MRF). Given the eye tracking data from a test image. it predicts potential face/head (humans. dogs and cats) and text locations reliably. Furthermore. the approach can be used to select regions of interest for further analysis by object detectors for faces and text. The hybrid eye position/object detector approach achieves better detection performance and reduced computation time compared to using only the object detection algorithm.
