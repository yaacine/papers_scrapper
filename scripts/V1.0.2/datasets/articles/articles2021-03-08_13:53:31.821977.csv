1169240,Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness.,1994,Karl Grammer and Randy Thornhill,108,Journal of comparative psychology,3,233,American Psychological Association,Hypothesized from the parasite theory of sexual selection that men (Homo sapiens) would prefer averageness and symmetry in women's faces. that women would prefer averageness and symmetry in men's faces. and that women would prefer largeness (not averageness) of the secondary sexual traits of men's faces. The authors generated computer images of men's and women's faces and of composites of the faces of each sex. and then had men and women rate opposite-sex faces for 4 variables (attractive. dominant. sexy. and healthy). Symmetry. averageness. and the sizes of facial features were measured on the computerized faces. The hypotheses were supported. with the exception of the hypothesized effects of averageness of female and male faces on attractiveness ratings.

1169241,Facial attractiveness,1999,Randy Thornhill and Steven W Gangestad,3,,12,452-460,Elsevier Current Trends,Humans in societies around the world discriminate between potential mates on the basis of attractiveness in ways that can dramatically affect their lives. From an evolutionary perspective. a reasonable working hypothesis is that the psychological mechanisms underlying attractiveness judgments are adaptations that have evolved in the service of choosing a mate so as to increase gene propagation throughout evolutionary history. The main hypothesis that has directed evolutionary psychology research into facial attractiveness is that these judgments reflect information about what can be broadly defined as an individual’s health. This has been investigated by examining whether attractiveness judgments show special design for detecting cues that allow us to make assessments of overall phenotypic condition.

1169242,A natural history of rape: Biological bases of sexual coercion,2001,Randy Thornhill and Craig T Palmer,,,,,MIT press,"A biologist and an anthropologist use evolutionary biology to explain the causes and inform the prevention of rape. In this controversial book. Randy Thornhill and Craig Palmer use evolutionary biology to explain the causes of rape and to recommend new approaches to its prevention. According to Thornhill and Palmer. evolved adaptation of some sort gives rise to rape; the main evolutionary question is whether rape is an adaptation itself or a by-product of other adaptations. Regardless of the answer. Thornhill and Palmer note. rape circumvents a central feature of women's reproductive strategy: mate choice. This is a primary reason why rape is devastating to its victims. especially young women. Thornhill and Palmer address. and claim to demolish scientifically. many myths about rape bred by social science theory over the past twenty-five years. The popular contention that rapists are not motivated by sexual desire is. they argue. scientifically inaccurate. Although they argue that rape is biological. Thornhill and Palmer do not view it as inevitable. Their recommendations for rape prevention include teaching young males not to rape. punishing rape more severely. and studying the effectiveness of"" chemical castration."" They also recommend that young women consider the biological causes of rape when making decisions about dress. appearance. and social activities. Rape could cease to exist. they argue. only in a society knowledgeable about its evolutionary causes.

1169243,Human facial beauty,1993,Randy Thornhill and Steven W Gangestad,4,,3,237-269,Springer-Verlag,It is hypothesized that human faces judged to be attractive by people possess two features—averageness and symmetry—that promoted adaptive mate selection in human evolutionary history by way of production of offspring with parasite resistance. Facial composites made by combining individual faces are judged to be attractive. and more attractive than the majority of individual faces. The composites possess both symmetry and averageness of features. Facial averageness may reflect high individual protein heterozygosity and thus an array of proteins to which parasites must adapt. Heterozygosity may be an important defense of long-lived hosts against parasites when it occurs in portions of the genome that do not code for the essential features of complex adaptations. In this case heterozygosity can create a hostile microenvironment for parasites without disrupting adaptation.

In humans (Homo sapiens). many psychological phenomena appear to serve an antipathogen defence function. One broad implication is the existence of cross-cultural differences in human cognition and behaviour contingent upon the relative presence of pathogens in the local ecology. We focus specifically on one fundamental cultural variable: differences in individualistic versus collectivist values. We suggest that specific behavioural manifestations of collectivism (e.g. ethnocentrism. conformity) can inhibit the transmission of pathogens; and so we hypothesize that collectivism (compared with individualism) will more often characterize cultures in regions that have historically had higher prevalence of pathogens.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1431,1913-1917,The Royal Society,Cues of phenotypic condition should be among those used by women in their choice of mates. One marker of better phenotypic condition is thought to be symmetrical bilateral body and facial features. However. it is not clear whether women use symmetry as the primary cue in assessing the phenotypic quality of potential mates or whether symmetry is correlated with other facial markers affecting physical attractiveness. Using photographs of men's faces. for which facial symmetry had been measured. we found a relationship between women's attractiveness ratings of these faces and symmetry. but the subjects could not rate facial symmetry accurately. Moreover. the relationship between facial attractiveness and symmetry was still observed. even when symmetry cues were removed by presenting only the left or right half of faces.

Mate choice theory and the generally greater control of the process of reproduction by females than by males imply that female choice is prevalent in organisms and that it may be subtle in its nature. occurring even after mating and at any time until the female's control of gametes or zygotes terminates. Female choice in the Australian scorpionfly Harpobittacus nigriceps. a species in which males provide females with a nuptial arthropod gift during mating. was studied in the field and laboratory. Female choice before mating occurs in H. nigriceps and there is considerable evidence of its occurrence during and after mating in this species.

Beautiful and irresistible features have evolved numerous times in plants and animals due to sexual selection. and such preferences and beauty standards provide evidence for the claim that human beauty and obsession with bodily beauty are mirrored in analogous traits and tendencies throughout the plant and animal kingdoms.

Women in low-fertility phases of the cycle and women using hormone-based contraceptives do not show this pattern. The current study replicated these findings with a larger sample and statistically controlled for men's hygiene and other factors that were not controlled in the first study. The current study also examined women's scent attractiveness to men and found no evidence that men prefer the scent of symmetric women.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1399,927-933,The Royal Society,Evidence suggests that female sexual preferences change across the menstrual cycle. Women's extra–pair copulations tend to occur in their most fertile period. whereas their intra–pair copulations tend to be more evenly spread out across the cycle. This pattern is consistent with women preferentially seeking men who evidence phenotypic markers of genetic benefits just before and during ovulation. This study examined whether women's olfactory preferences for men's scent would tend to favour the scent of more symmetrical men. most notably during the women's fertile period. College women sniffed and rated the attractiveness of the scent of 41 T–shirts worn over a period of two nights by different men.

There are reasons to believe that developmental stability and phenotypic quality are related. Recent studies of nonhuman animals indicate that developmental stability. measured as fluctuating asymmetry in generally bilateral symmetrical traits. is predictive of performance in sexual selection: Relatively symmetrical males are advantaged under sexual selection.

We propose that this cross-cultural variation is a result of a contingent psychological adaptation that facilitates in-group assortative sociality in the face of high levels of parasite-stress while devaluing in-group assortative sociality in areas with low levels of parasite-stress. This is because in-group assortative sociality is more important for the avoidance of infection from novel parasites and for the management of infection in regions with high levels of parasite-stress compared with regions of low infectious disease stress. We examined this hypothesis by testing the predictions that there would be a positive association between parasite-stress and strength of family ties or religiosity. We conducted this study by comparing among nations and among states in the United States of America. We found for both the international and the interstate analyses that in-group assortative sociality was positively associated with parasite-stress. This was true when controlling for potentially confounding factors such as human freedom and economic development. The findings support the parasite-stress theory of sociality. that is. the proposal that parasite-stress is central to the evolution of social life in humans and other animals.,True,f8Q2LccAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,524,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/77679/,8918710118684839322,/scholar?cites=8918710118684839322,,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/77679/1/77679.pdf,0,0,0

1169260,Human rape: An evolutionary analysis,1983,Randy Thornhill and Nancy Wilmsen Thornhill,4,Ethology and Sociobiology,3,137-173,Elsevier,Human evolutionary history was apparently one of polygyny. Polygyny favors the use of different reproductive options by human males with different competitive abilities. These options or alternatives collectively represent a single conditional strategy; which alternatives are employed depend on conditions encountered during a man's life history. It is hypothesized that human rape is an evolved facultative alternative that is primarily employed when men are unable to complete for resources and status necessary to attract and reproduce successfully with desirable mates. According to this hypothesis males that cannot effectively compete may employ rape as the only behavioral alternative. or depending on circumstances of relative status and family composition. they may incorporate rape into a repertoire of other behavioral patterns. including low commital pairbonding with one or more females and/or investing …,True,f8Q2LccAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,473,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309583900274,12010170780533143868,/scholar?cites=12010170780533143868,,,0,0,0

The present study shows that skin texture plays a significant role in the judgment of female facial beauty. Following research in clinical dermatology. the authors developed a computer program that implemented an algorithm based on co-occurrence matrices for the analysis of facial skin texture. Homogeneity and contrast features as well as color parameters were extracted out of stimulus faces. Attractiveness ratings of the images made by male participants relate positively to parameters of skin homogeneity. The authors propose that skin texture is a cue to fertility and health.

Such evidence indicates that physical attractiveness is an honest or Zahavian signal of phenotypic and genetic quality.

1169266,The ancestress hypothesis: Visual art as adaptation,2003,Kathryn Coe,,,,,Rutgers University Press,In our society it has long been believed that art serves very little social purpose. Evolutionary anthropologists. however. are examining a potential role for art in human evolution. Kathryn Coe looks to the visual arts of traditional societies for clues. Because they are passed down from previous generations. traditional art forms such as body decoration. funeral ornaments. and ancestral paintings offer ways to promote social relationships among kin and codescendants of a common ancestor. Mothers used art forms to anchor themselves and their kin to the father and his kin. and to promote the survival and reproductive success of kin and descendants. Individuals who abided by this strategy. accompanied by its strict codes of cooperation. left more descendants than did individuals who did not. Over time. given this reproductive success. large numbers of individuals would be identified as codescendants of a common ancestor and would cooperate as if they were close kin. These cooperative codescendants were more likely to survive and leave descendants. With each new generation these clans propagated not only their genes but also their behavioral strategy. the replication or presence of “art.” The book concludes by examining the changing characteristics of visual art—including a higher value on creativity. competition. and cost—when traditional constraints on social behavior disappear.,True,gbFgDL8AAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC,159,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=4HF1WB63UQwC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=info:Q9O8i41DccIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=t33fknJfsg&sig=XSLCHYd-qhLBQWfvqUp3IkTIre4,14011054190940181315,/scholar?cites=14011054190940181315,,,0,0,0
1169267,Family relationships: An evolutionary perspective,2007,Catherine A Salmon and Todd K Shackelford,,,,,Oxford University Press,Kinship ties-the close relationships found within the family-have been a central focus of evolutionary biological analyses of social behavior ever since biologist William Hamilton extended the concept of Darwinian fitness to include an individual's actions benefiting not only his own offspring. but also collateral kin. Evolutionary biologists consider organisms not only reproductive strategists. but also nepotistic strategists. If a person's genes are just as likely to be reproduced in her sister as in her daughter. then we should expect the evolution of sororal investment in the same way as one expects maternal investment. This concept has revolutionized biologists' understanding of social interaction and developmental psychologists' understanding of the family. However. kinship ties have largely been ignored in other areas of psychology. particularly social psychology. Family Relationships brings together leading theorists and researchers from evolutionary psychology and related disciplines to illustrate the ways in which an evolutionary perspective can inform our study and understanding of family relationships. The contributors argue that family psychology is relationship specific: the relationship between mother and daughter is different from that between father and daughter or that between brother and sister or sister and sister. In other words. humans have evolved specialized mechanisms for processing information and motivating behavior that deal with the distinct demands of being a mate. father. mother. sibling. child. or grandparent. Such an evolutionary perspective on family dynamics provides a unique insight into human behavior.

1169281,Art: The replicable unit—An inquiry into the possible origin of art as a social behavior,1992,Kathryn Coe,15,Journal of Social and Evolutionary Systems,2,217-234,JAI,Most scholars of art have assumed. since Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection. that at one point humans had no art. for some reason they began to produce it. and since that time this behavior has persisted and often flourished. Attempts to identify the origin of art. however. have generated acrimonious debate. There is no agreement about which of various objects. produced in widely separated times by a variety of our early ancestors. are the original art objects; and no widely accepted general model for the origin of art has emerged. Much of me acrimony surrounding attempts to identify the origin of art or to increase our understanding about this apparently ancient and universal human behavior stems from our failure to define the term “art” explicitly and empirically. Towards that end. a theoretical definition of the visual arts will be proposed and then used in an attempt to identify the origin of art …,True,gbFgDL8AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,37,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/106173619290005X,8427390391441717876,/scholar?cites=8427390391441717876,,https://www.academia.edu/download/55921426/Art_the_replicable_unit.pdf,0,0,0

1169284,The words of our ancestors: Kinship. tradition. and moral codes,2008,Kathryn Coe and Craig T Palmer,,,,,,In this paper we use the cross-cultural record to identify the behavioral rules of conduct. and the system supporting those rules. that are found in traditional societies. such as tribal societies. We then draw on the historical record to identify the behavioral rules of conduct. and the system supporting those rules that were found in the early state. The proposal tested here is that in traditional societies the behavioral rules of conduct and the systems that support them (e.g.. processes for identifying guilt. punishing offenders. enacting legislation. preventing conflict) are aimed at promoting enduring. cooperative relationships among individuals who are identified as kin through common ancestry. The assumption underlying this proposal is that once human females increased their investment in offspring. cultural strategies to protect those offspring became more important. A moral system. which is the term we use to refer to the early system of behavioral codes. protected offspring by turning conspecific threats into the protectors. providers. and educators of children. It did this by creating a strong kinship system. the members of which were bound by common ancestry (actual or metaphorical). thus tying individuals into enduring. cooperative relationships by using culture to encourage them to honor ongoing duties to one another. This kinship-based moral system is significantly different from that found in societies in which the majority of interactions are with non-kin. interactions often center on the exchange of good and services. and traditions have largely been broken down.

This tendency has been recently labeled moral elevation. and evolutionary theorists are only beginning to consider hypotheses about why it might have been favored by natural selection. Moral elevation is a puzzle for evolutionary explanations of altruism based on kin selection or reciprocal altruism. as the altruism it produces among the morally elevated it does not appear directed exclusively toward close kin or likely reciprocators. and can even be directed toward complete strangers. As such. the various forms of group selection discussed in current evolutionary literature are taken by their proponents as means of explaining such behavior.

Moral elevation refers to the ability of prosocial acts to inspire people to engage in their own acts of charity and kindness. When morally elevating stories and visual depictions become traditional by being passed from one generation to the next. they can produce prosocial behavior advantageous to survival and reproduction among many generations of descendants. Traditions that increase the number of descendants in future generations can be seen as descendant‐leaving strategies. Stories and visual depictions of the sacrifices of saints appear to be designed to produce states of moral elevation. and they have been transmitted from one generation to the next for many centuries.

1169294,Costly Signaling Theory. Sexual Selection. and the Influence of Ancestors on Religious Behaviour,2015,Craig T Palmer and Ryan O Begley,,,,93–110,Bloomsbury Academic,Our goal in this chapter is to demonstrate the failure of evolutionary explanations of costly acts associated with religion to account for and incorporate a crucial influence on human behavior: the generational influence of ancestors on the behavior of their descendants through the exhibition and transmission of traditional behavior. A fundamental revision of certain key evolutionary concepts is necessary in order to explain the costly behaviors often encouraged through religious traditions. In order to support this hypothesis. we must first briefly describe the current form of these concepts. Despite the controversy and often fiery debate that has characterized the relationship between researchers using evolutionary theory to explain human behavior and the rest of social science researchers since the 1960s. both evolutionary and non-evolutionary theorists share a fundamental assumption about human behavior: that behaviors will in some way benefit the individual performing them. Non-evolutionary social scientists generally assume hedonistic impulses guide behavior and thus expect the benefit to come in the form of pleasure. or at least in the avoidance of pain. 1 Hedonism is at best an incomplete explanation for human behavior because it does not provide an ultimate explanation for why humans find some experiences pleasurable and others painful. If a hedonistic explanation specifies the type of pleasure maximized (sex. power. status. wealth. etc.). examples of people giving up (ie sacrificing) such pleasure (sex. power. status. wealth. etc.) serve as evidence that quickly falsifies the explanation.,True,eCZQ5NEAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,12,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8504734102565431296&hl=en&oi=scholarr,8504734102565431296,/scholar?cites=8504734102565431296,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ryan_Begley3/publication/283503520_Costly_Signaling_Theory_Sexual_Selection_and_the_Influence_of_Ancestors_on_Religious_Behaviour/links/56f3d65f08ae81582beebb49.pdf,0,0,0

1169299,From Blood Feuds to Civility: Romeo and Juliet and the Changing Evolutionary Role of Cultural Traditions,2015,Ryan O Begley and Kathryn Coe and Craig T Palmer,11,ASEBL Journal,1,2–16,,Evidence from ethnographic and historical records suggests that blood feuds have been a common aspect of human existence. Conventional evolutionary explanations have seen them as examples of nepotism and kin solidarity explainable by kin selection. However. the same records also reveal certain aspects of blood feuds for which kin selection alone cannot account. Examples include traditional rules and practices regulating blood feuds and the tendency of blood feuds to decrease in state-level social organizations–where some overarching political entity brings into close and persistent contact. within state boundaries. multiple categories of individuals with differing ancestry. Hence a universal challenge in the formation and persistence of states is to persuade individuals to cooperate with non-kin. Tactics often include a combination of deemphasizing kinship while emphasizing forms of fictive kinship among “fellow citizens” of the state. Essential to this goal is the suppression of traditional forms of justice–especially blood feuds–that threaten state cohesion. It is within this context that the events in Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet unfold. While the story of “starcross’d lovers” is attractive. great historical significance can be found in the blood feud that drives the tragedy.

I propose that storytelling shows evidence of design to manipulate the behavior of others. Specifically. traditional stories prescribing kinship behavior can be seen as part of the human descendant-leaving strategy. whereby ancestors. through the portrayal of the consequences of character behavior. were able to manipulate the behavior of their descendants in such a way that left descendants. I apply my theoretical argument for storytelling through a critical analysis of William Shakespeare's Hamlet.

The data analyzed in these studies. with few exceptions. come from local floras. within which it was possible to contrast the subsets of dioecious and nondioecious taxa with regard to the traits in question. However. if there is a strong phylogenetic component to the presence or absence of dioecy. regional sampling may result in spurious associations.

University of Chicago Press, Chicago",,123-144,,The long-term stability of mutualisms depends on each partner’s ability to limit deception and cheating. Even so. antagonistic elements are widespread in mutualisms. This chapter reviews antagonistic pollinator–ﬂower interactions in which ﬂowers do not provide a reward to their pollinators. The other side of the coin—antagonistic interactions in which visitors exploit ﬂower resources without delivering pollination—lies outside the focus of this review. After deﬁning pollinator deception and summarizing the data on its phylogenetic distribution in the angiosperms. recent insights into insect. especially bee. cognition (eg. Chittka and Thomson 2001) are introduced to answer the question of why exploitative systems persist. A key point is that pollinators constantly encounter temporarily or permanently rewardless ﬂowers. and it is against this background that the evolution of exploitative systems has to be seen. Insect behavior and cognition are especially relevant because insects are the predominant pollinators of ﬂowering plants (Regal 1977. 1982; Crepet 1984); of the 13.500 genera of angiosperms. about 500 contain bird-pollinated species. 250 contain bat-pollinated species. 874 contain solely wind or water pollinated species. and the remainder contain mostly insect-pollinated species (Renner and Ricklefs 1995). Understanding insect vision. olfaction. and learning is therefore key to understanding pollinator deception. This is taken up at the end of this chapter. together with the question of how deception may relate to ecological generalization or specialization.

We analyzed the library both by phylogenetic screening based on 16S rRNA gene amplification from clone pools and by sequencing both insert extremities of ca. 5.000 fosmids. Genome recruitment strategies showed that the majority of high scoring pairs corresponded to genomes from Rhizobiales within the Alphaproteobacteria. Cenarchaeum symbiosum. Planctomycetes. Acidobacteria. Chloroflexi and Gammaproteobacteria. We have found a community structure similar to that found in the aphotic zone of the Pacific. However. the similarities were significantly higher to the mesopelagic (500–700 m deep) in the Pacific than to the single 4000 m deep sample studied at this location.

Morphology-based taxonomic schemes distinguished two major kinetoplastid groups: the strictly parasitic. uniflagellate trypanosomatids and the biflagellate bodonids. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on 18S rRNA sequence comparison suggested that the trypanosomatids emerged from within the bodonids. However. these analyses revealed a huge evolutionary distance between the kinetoplastids and their closest relatives (euglenids and diplonemids) that makes very difficult the correct inference of the phylogenetic relationships between the different kinetoplastid groups.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1449,1213-1221,The Royal Society,The current paradigm of eukaryotic evolution is based primarily on comparative analysis of ribosomal RNA sequences. It shows several early–emerging lineages. mostly amitochondriate. which might be living relics of a progressive assembly of the eukaryotic cell. However. the analysis of slow–evolving positions. carried out with the newly developed slow–fast method. reveals that these lineages are. in terms of nucleotide substitution. fast–evolving ones. misplaced at the base of the tree by a long branch attraction artefact. Since the fast–evolving groups are not always the same. depending on which macromolecule is used as a marker. this explains most of the observed incongruent phylogenies. The current paradigm of eukaryotic evolution thus has to be seriously re–examined as the eukaryotic phylogeny is presently best summarized by a multifurcation.

Various models propose that these enzymes originated during the speciation of the two prokaryotic domains. and the nature (and even the very existence) of lipid membranes in the last universal common ancestor (cenancestor) is subject to debate.

They also propose that this was mediated by interspecies hydrogen transfer and that. initially. mitochondria were anaerobic. These hypotheses explain the mosaic character of eukaryotes (i.e. an archaeal-like genetic machinery and a eubacterial-like metabolism). as well as distinct eukaryotic characteristics (which are proposed to be products of symbiosis).

Although they are produced from the condensation of the same precursors in all organisms (isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate). the evolutionary origin of their biosynthesis remains controversial. Two independent nonhomologous metabolic pathways are known: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in eukaryotes and archaea and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in bacteria and several photosynthetic eukaryotes. The MVA pathway is also found in a few bacteria. what has been explained in previous works by recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from eukaryotic or archaeal donors.

Most marine metagenomic analyses have been nearly exclusively devoted to photic waters.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe constructed a metagenomic fosmid library from 3.000 m-deep Mediterranean plankton. which is much warmer (∼14°C) than waters of similar depth in open oceans (∼2°C). We analyzed the library both by phylogenetic screening based on 16S rRNA gene amplification from clone pools and by sequencing both insert extremities of ca. 5.000 fosmids. Genome recruitment strategies showed that the majority of high scoring pairs corresponded to genomes from Rhizobiales within the Alphaproteobacteria. Cenarchaeum symbiosum. Planctomycetes. Acidobacteria. Chloroflexi and Gammaproteobacteria. We have found a community structure similar to that found in the aphotic zone of the Pacific. However. the similarities were significantly higher to the mesopelagic (500–700 m deep) in the Pacific than to the single 4000 m deep sample studied at this location. Metabolic genes were mostly related to catabolism. transport and degradation of complex organic molecules. in agreement with a prevalent heterotrophic lifestyle for deep-sea microbes.

However. the recent publication of the genome sequence of the Mimivirus. a giant virus that parasitises amoebas. strengthened the idea that viruses should be included in the tree of life. In fact. the first phylogenetic analyses of a few Mimivirus genes that are also present in cellular lineages suggested that it could define an independent branch in the tree of life in addition to the three domains. Bacteria. Archaea and Eucarya. We tested this hypothesis by carrying out detailed phylogenetic analyses for all the conserved Mimivirus genes that have homologues in cellular organisms. We found no evidence supporting Mimivirus as a new branch in the tree of life. On the contrary. our phylogenetic trees strongly suggest that Mimivirus acquired most of these genes by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) either from its amoebal hosts or from bacteria that parasitise the same hosts. The detection of HGT events involving different eukaryotic donors suggests that the spectrum of hosts of Mimivirus may be larger than currently known.

FL: Academic Press. c1992-,Resolution of the phylogenetic relationships among the major eukaryotic groups is one of the most important problems in evolutionary biology that is still only partially solved. This task was initially addressed using a single marker. the small-subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). although in recent years it has been shown that it does not contain enough phylogenetic information to robustly resolve global eukaryotic phylogeny. This has prompted the use of multi-gene analyses. especially in the form of long concatenations of numerous conserved protein sequences.

Recent environmental DNA surveys based on clone libraries of rRNA genes confirm this observation and reveal a high diversity of eukaryotes present in deep-sea sediment samples. However. environmental clone-library surveys yield only a modest number of sequences with which to evaluate the diversity of abyssal eukaryotes.   Methodology/Principal Findings Here. we examined the richness of eukaryotic DNA in deep Arctic and Southern Ocean samples using massively parallel sequencing of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) V9 hypervariable region. In very small volumes of sediments. ranging from 0.35 to 0.7 g. we recovered up to 7.499 unique sequences per sample. By clustering sequences having up to 3 differences. we observed from 942 to 1756 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) per sample. Taxonomic analyses of these OTUs showed that DNA of all major groups of eukaryotes is represented at the deep-sea floor. The dinoflagellates. cercozoans. ciliates. and euglenozoans predominate. contributing to 17%. 16%. 10%. and 8% of all assigned OTUs. respectively. Interestingly. many sequences represent photosynthetic taxa or are similar to those reported from the environmental surveys of surface waters. Moreover. each sample contained from 31 to 71 different metazoan OTUs despite the small sample volume collected. This indicates that a significant faction of the eukaryotic DNA sequences likely do not belong to living organisms. but represent either free. extracellular DNA or remains and resting stages of planktonic species.

However. characterization and knowledge of fungal communities is hampered because few primer sets are available to quantify fungal abundance by real-time quantitative PCR (real-time Q-PCR). The aim in this study was to quantify fungal abundance in soils by incorporating. into a real-time Q-PCR using the SYBRGreen® method. a primer set already used to study the genetic structure of soil fungal communities. To satisfy the real-time Q-PCR requirements to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of the detection technique. this study focused on the 18S rRNA gene conserved regions. These regions are little affected by length polymorphism and may provide sufficiently small targets. a crucial criterion for enhancing accuracy and reproducibility of the detection technique. An in silico analysis of 33 primer sets targeting the 18S rRNA gene was performed to select the primer set with the best potential for real-time Q-PCR: short amplicon length; good fungal specificity and coverage. The best consensus between specificity. coverage and amplicon length among the 33 sets tested was the primer set FR1 / FF390. This in silico analysis of the specificity of FR1 / FF390 also provided additional information to the previously published analysis on this primer set. The specificity of the primer set FR1 / FF390 for Fungi was validated in vitro by cloning - sequencing the amplicons obtained from a real time Q-PCR assay performed on five independent soil samples.

Genetic libraries of the 18S rRNA gene were constructed using two different primer sets. The first set is commonly used to amplify the majority of eukaryotic lineages. while the second was composed of a general eukaryotic forward primer and a reverse primer biased towards the phylum Chloroplastida. A total of 3980 partial environmental sequences were obtained: 1668 using the general eukaryotic primer set and 2312 using the Chloroplastida‐biased primer set.

Heidelberg,In the last decade. the use of flow cytometry (FCM) has become more and more popular among limnologists and marine biologists. both for laboratory studies and field research. FCM allows the analysis of phytoplanktonic cells that are too dim to be discriminated by epifluorescence microscopy. Its major advantages are to provide rapid and accurate measurements of individual particles and to allow the discrimination between- auto and heterotrophic populations as well as between cells and detritus or suspended sediments. FCM is particularly well suited for the study of the smallest size class of the plankton (below 2 μm). called picoplankton. Picoplankton is composed by 4 major groups: heterotrophic prokaryotes. prochlorophytes (Prochlorococcus).1 cyanobacteria (Synechococcus)2 and eukaryotes.

Their life cycle and morphology resemble those of zoosporic fungi (chytrids) and rozellids (Cryptomycota/Rozellosporidia). another specious group of parasites of fungi and oomycetes. Unlike fungi. which are osmotrophs. aphelids and rozellids are phagotrophs. feeding on the host’s cytoplasm. Combined RNA polymerase and rRNA gene trees suggested that aphelids and rozellids relate to Microsporidia. extremely reduced parasites with remnant mitochondria. Accordingly. aphelids. rozellids and Microsporidia were proposed to form a monophyletic clade sister to Fungi. called Opisthosporidia. Microsporidia would have subsequently lost the ancestral opisthosporidian phagotrophy. However. the limited phylogenetic signal of those genes combined with microsporidian fast-evolving sequences have resulted in incongruent tree topologies. showing either rozellids or aphelids as the earliestbranching lineages of Opisthosporidia. and challenging their monophyly. We have generated the first transcriptome data for one aphelid species. Paraphelidium tribonemae.

Amoeboradix gromovi and Sanchytrium tribonematis. showed that they formed a monophyletic group without affinity with any known fungal clade.

We infer four independent flagellum losses from the distribution of over 60 flagellum-specific proteins across Holomycota.

While the ancient nature of these organelles preclude understanding the transition from a bacterium to an organelle (organellogenesis). the study of eukaryotic cells with recently evolved obligate endosymbiotic bacteria has the potential to provide important insights into the early events in the organellogenesis. Diatoms belonging to the family Rhopalodiaceae and their N2-fixing cyanobacterial endosymbionts (spheroid bodies) are emerging as a useful model system in this regard. The experimental data accumulated to date suggest that the endosymbiont has been already integrated into the host cell during the endosymbiotic relationship. Our previous study on the genome sequence of the endosymbiont in a rhopalodiacean diatom provided insight into its reductive evolution and the metabolic dependency on the diatom host.

Pelomyxa gruberi. have been described. The entire life cycle of this eukaryotic microbe involves an alteration of uni and multinucleate stages and is commonly completed within a year. Reproduction occurs by plasmotomy of multinucleate amoebae: they form division rosettes or divide unequally. Various surface parts of this slowly moving organism characteristically form finger shaped hyaline protrusions. Besides. during the directed monopodial movement. a broad zone of hyaline cytoplasm with slender finger shaped hyaline protrusions is formed at the anterior part of the cell. In multinucleate stages up to 16 or even 32 nuclei of a vesicular type may be counted. Individuals with the highest numbers of nuclei were reported from the southernmost part of the investigated area: the North West Russia. Each nucleus of all life cycle stages is surrounded with microtubules. The structure of the flagellar apparatus differs in individuals of different age. Small uninucleate forms have considerably fewer flagella per cell than do larger or multinucleate amoebae but these may have aflagellated basal bodies submerged into the cytoplasm. In young individuals. undulipodia. where available. emerge from a characteristic flagellar pocket or tunnel. The basal bodies and associated rootlet microtubular derivatives (one radial and one basal) are organized similarly at all life cycle stages.

This occurs in firebugs. which exited the winter diapause. In the short period. preceding the mating of overwintered insects. the flagellates penetrate MTs of the host. multiply attached to the epithelial surface with their flagella. and start forming cyst-like amastigotes (CLAs) in large agglomerates. By the moment of oviposition. a large number of CLAs are already available in the rectum. They are discharged on the eggs' surface with feces. used for transmission of bugs' symbiotic bacteria. which are compulsorily engulfed by the newly hatched nymphs along with the CLAs. The obligate development of B. papi in MTs is definitely linked to the life cycle synchronization. The absence of peristalsis allow the trypanosomatids to accumulate and form dense CLA-forming subpopulations. whereas the lack of peritrophic structures facilitates the extensive discharge of CLAs directly into the hindgut lumen. The massive release of CLAs associated with oviposition is indispensable for maximization of the infection efficiency at the most favorable time point.,True,EAW3AVAAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC,9,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204467,14394305756480080148,/scholar?cites=14394305756480080148,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204467,0,0,0

Phytomonas lipae. parasitizing the dock bug Coreus marginatus based on axenic culture and in vivo material. Using light and electron microscopy we characterized the development of this flagellate in the intestine. hemolymph and salivary glands of its insect host. The intestinal promastigotes of Phytomonas lipae do not divide and occur only in the anterior part of the midgut. From there they pass into hemolymph. increasing in size. and then to salivary glands. where they actively proliferate without attachment to the host's epithelium and form infective endomastigotes. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses based on 18s rRNA. gGAPDH and HSP83 gene sequences. of which the third marker performed the best in terms of resolving phylogenetic relationships within the genus Phytomonas. Our inference demonstrated rather early origin of the lineage comprising the new species. right after that of P. oxycareni. which represents the earliest known branch within the Phytomonas clade.

This task was initially addressed using a single marker. the small-subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). although in recent years it has been shown that it does not contain enough phylogenetic information to robustly resolve global eukaryotic phylogeny. This has prompted the use of multi-gene analyses. especially in the form of long concatenations of numerous conserved protein sequences. However. this approach is severely limited by the small number of taxa for which such a large number of protein sequences is available today. We have explored the alternative approach of using only two markers but a large taxonomic sampling. by analysing a combination of SSU and large-subunit (LSU) rDNA sequences.

The key advantages of eDNA analysis include the detection of cryptic or otherwise elusive organisms. large-scale sampling with fewer biases than specimen-based methods. and generation of data for molecular systematics. These are particularly relevant for parasitology because parasites can be difficult to locate and are morphologically intractable and genetically divergent.

1169474,Three reasons to re-evaluate fungal diversity ‘on Earth and in the ocean’,2011,David Bass and Thomas A Richards,25,,4,159-164,Elsevier,Attempts to assess fungal global species richness are confounded by several problems: uncertainty about the number of described species. incomplete fungal inventories even at a high taxonomic level. high diversity of unknown. often small and elusive taxa. high levels of morphological conservation. and incomplete knowledge of their ecological and biogeographical distributions. The two main bases for estimating total fungal diversity are (1) the number of described species and their taxonomic structure. and (2) extrapolating species-area relationships. We argue that knowledge of fungal taxonomy and environmental sampling of fungi are both too incomplete for either approach to be reliable.

The ubiquitous dispersal hypothesis states that microbes are so numerous and so easily dispersed worldwide that all should be globally distributed and found wherever growing conditions suit them. This has been broadly upheld for protists (microbial eukaryotes) by most morphological and some molecular analyses. However. morphology and most previously used evolutionary markers evolve too slowly to test this important hypothesis adequately. Here we use a fast-evolving marker (ITS1 rDNA) to map global diversity and distribution of three different clades of cercomonad Protozoa (Eocercomonas and Paracercomonas: phylum Cercozoa) by sequencing multiple environmental gene libraries constructed from 47–80 globally-dispersed samples per group. Even with this enhanced resolution. identical ITS sequences (ITS-types) were retrieved from widely separated sites and on all continents for several genotypes. implying relatively rapid global dispersal. Some identical ITS-types were even recovered from both marine and non-marine samples. habitats that generally harbour significantly different protist communities. Conversely. other ITS-types had either patchy or restricted distributions. Our results strongly suggest that geographic dispersal in macro-organisms and microbes is not fundamentally different: some taxa show restricted and/or patchy distributions while others are clearly cosmopolitan. These results are concordant with the 'moderate endemicity model' of microbial biogeography.

Traditionally. there are three groups comprising Eumycetozoa: myxogastrids. dictyostelids. and the so-called protostelids. Dictyostelids and myxogastrids both make multicellular fruiting bodies that may contain hundreds of spores. Protostelids are those amoebae that make simple fruiting bodies consisting of a stalk and one or a few spores. Protostelid-like organisms have been suggested as the progenitors of the myxogastrids and dictyostelids. and they have been used to formulate hypotheses on the evolution of fruiting within the group. Molecular phylogenies have been published for both myxogastrids and dictyostelids. but little molecular phylogenetic work has been done on the protostelids. Here we provide phylogenetic trees based on the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) that include 21 protostelids along with publicly available sequences from a wide variety of amoebae and other eukaryotes. SSU trees recover seven well supported clades that contain protostelids but do not appear to be specifically related to one another and are often interspersed among established groups of amoebae that have never been reported to fruit. In fact. we show that at least two taxa unambiguously belong to amoebozoan lineages where fruiting has never been reported. These analyses indicate that we can reject a monophyletic Eumycetozoa. s.l.

This clade of amoebozoans has received considerable attention from the broader scientific community as Acanthamoeba spp. represent both model organisms and human pathogens.

Sappinia pedata. the type species. and S. diploidea. The amoebae of both species are essentially identical according to the literature. The two species are distinguished by S. pedata having a standing amoeba stage. incorrectly interpreted as a cyst. and S. diploidea having sessile. bicellular cysts. Using four isolates of S. pedata collected from around the world. we present detailed light micrographic illustrations of all stages of its life cycle. We confirm that the standing amoeba lacks a cell wall. In two isolates of S. pedata. there are bicellular cysts indistinguishable from those of S. diploidea. Using sequence data from the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. we conclude that S. pedata and the published neotype of S. diploidea are congeneric but not conspecific …,True,KqYAoy8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,43,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1550-7408.2007.00292.x,13448769941658852625,/scholar?cites=13448769941658852625,,,0,0,0

However underwater habitats largely have been overlooked. The purpose of this study was to determine whether protostelids do occur in aquatic habitats and to survey the myxomycetes associated with these habitats. Protostelids and myxomycetes were isolated from substrates collected from just above and just below the surface of the water. Several species of both groups were present. and their distributions above and below the water were different. It is not surprising that the trophic cells of slime molds occur in ponds because they are known to grow in films of water.

The general morphology and ultrastructure are consistent with what has been reported for otherEumycetozoa (protostelids. myxomycetes. and dictyostelids). The flagellar apparatus structure has the same basic pattern as that of other flagellate eumycetozoans. It shares with all these an anteriorly directed flagellum and centriole and microtubule arrays (MTA) 2–4. Unlike more primitive species which have two centrioles per flagellar apparatus.P. aurantium has only one. Also. the flagellar apparatus is independent of the nucleus inP. aurantium. not linked to it as in the primitive species. These features are useful in explaining the differences in swimming behavior betweenP. aurantium and biflagellate species.

The classical taxonomy of the dictyostelid cellular slime molds (Dictyosteliales) involves a convenient set of categories that were developed independent of phylogeny. In order to test whether the characters supporting the classical taxonomy hold any phylogenetic signal. we subjected 19 described taxa belonging to two families (Acytosteliaceae and Dictyosteliaceae) and three genera (Acytostelium. Dictyostelium. and Polysphondylium) to rooted cladistic analyses using PAUP* v 4.0b4a. Neither family nor any of the three genera were found to represent monophyletic groups.

1169539,Current ecological understanding of fungal-like pathogens of fish: what lies beneath?,2014,Rodolphe Elie Gozlan and Wyth Marshall and Osu Lilje and Casey Jessop and Frank H Gleason and Demetra Andreou,5,,,62,Frontiers,Despite increasingly sophisticated microbiological techniques. and long after the first discovery of microbes. basic knowledge is still lacking to fully appreciate the ecological importance of microbial parasites in fish. This is likely due to the nature of their habitats as many species of fish suffer from living beneath turbid water away from easy recording. However. fishes represent key ecosystem services for millions of people around the world and the absence of a functional ecological understanding of viruses. prokaryotes. and small eukaryotes in the maintenance of fish populations and of their diversity represents an inherent barrier to aquatic conservation and food security. Among recent emerging infectious diseases responsible for severe population declines in plant and animal taxa. fungal and fungal-like microbes have emerged as significant contributors. Here. we review the current knowledge gaps of fungal and fungal-like parasites and pathogens in fish and put them into an ecological perspective with direct implications for the monitoring of fungal fish pathogens in the wild. their phylogeography as well as their associated ecological impact on fish populations. With increasing fish movement around the world for farming. releases into the wild for sport fishing and human-driven habitat changes. it is expected. along with improved environmental monitoring of fungal and fungal-like infections. that the full extent of the impact of these pathogens on wild fish populations will soon emerge as a major threat to freshwater biodiversity.,True,dwFklHgAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,66,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00062/full,18407957228211552669,/scholar?cites=18407957228211552669,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00062/full,0,0,0
1169540,Structure and function of fungal zoospores: ecological implications,2009,Frank H Gleason and Osu Lilje,2,,2,53-59,Elsevier,Recent research suggests that fungal zoospores have important roles in ecosystems. Ultrastructural characteristics of zoospores and sequences of ribosomal RNA genes are increasingly being used in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies with zoosporic fungi. However. our current knowledge of the physiology and ecology of zoospores lags far behind our knowledge of phylogenetic relationships. Some aspects of the ecology of fungal zoospores are discussed in this review. Fungal zoospores have two mechanisms for active short range dispersal: flagellar and amoeboid movement. Flagellar movement is more common in open water and amoeboid movement more common on surfaces. All phases of the life cycle can be passively transported by currents in water for long range dispersal. As far as is known the zoospore never has a cell wall but can have a cell coat. This may cause zoospores to be more susceptible …,True,dwFklHgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,61,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175450480800041X,17473613124129742498,/scholar?cites=17473613124129742498,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Osu_Lilje/publication/248599688_Structure_and_function_of_fungal_zoospores_ecological_implications/links/5bfb6717a6fdcc53881acc34/Structure-and-function-of-fungal-zoospores-ecological-implications.pdf,0,0,0

Although poorly characterized taxonomically. species of Labyrinthula are very common in marine ecosystems. virulence of genotypes/phylotypes is known to be variable. and highly virulent species are able to cause ecologically significant diseases of protists. plants and animals. Here. the pathosystem model is applied to host–parasite relationships in seagrass ecosystems. Known physical and biological stressors of seagrass are reviewed.

Some members of the Chytridiomycota. Blastocladiomycota. Cryptomycota. Hyphochytriomycota. Labyrinthulomycota. Oomycota. and Phytomyxea are hyperparasites of zoosporic hosts. Because of sometimes complex tripartite interactions between hyperparasite. their parasite-host. and the primary host. hyperparasites can be difficult to detect and monitor. Some of these hyperparasites use similar mechanisms as their parasite-hosts to find and infect their target and to access food resources. The life cycle of zoosporic hyperparasites is usually shorter than the life cycle of their hosts. so hyperparasites may accelerate the turnaround times of nutrients within the ecosystem. Hyperparasites may increase the complexity of food webs and play significant roles in regulating population sizes and population dynamics of their hosts. We suggest that hyperparasites lengthen food chains but can also play a role in conducting or suppressing diseases of animals. plants or algae. Hyperparasites can significantly impact ecosystems in various ways. therefore it is important to increase our understanding about these cryptic and diverse organisms.,True,dwFklHgAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,42,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00244/full,9572267388303913534,/scholar?cites=9572267388303913534,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00244/full,0,0,0

Biomass and zoospore production over a period of time was measured to predict changes within a colony. In culture. AUS6 sporangia develop from zoospore within 25 h at 24 C. Timing of development from encystment. germination. sporangial enlargement and mature sporangial formation was significantly different between synthetic medium (CSM). modified CSM (no carbon or nitrogen) and complex medium (1/2 YpSs). However. initial aggregation of thalli occurred within 24 h in all media at 24 C.

An extracellular matrix was observed on the surface of the rhizoids and developing sporangia. Another matrix that appeared to reinforce the cell wall of enlarged sporangia was also identified in mature colonies. Both matrices facilitate the aggregation of thalli and continued maintenance of the colony structure. The entanglement of zoospores in branching rhizoids of older thalli also facilitates aggregation.

1169559,Restimulation of resting autoreactive T cells by Schwann cells in vitro,1999,O Lilje and PJ Armati,67,Experimental and molecular pathology,3,164-174,Academic Press,This study demonstrates that rat Schwann cells can reactivate resting experimental allergic neuritis generating P2 and P2 peptide specific CD4+ T cell lines. T cell proliferation was significantly greater to P2 than to P2 peptide (SP-26) or ovalbumin (OA). Four-level analysis of variance showed that T cell proliferation with endogenous or exogenous P2 was not significantly different for Schwann cells plus cytokine IFN-γ (P = 0.5071) unlike P2 peptide or OA specific T cells (P = 0.0056 and 0.0003. respectively). Untreated Schwann cells were more effective inducers than irradiated or fixed Schwann cells. As stimulated CD4+ P2 T cells produce IFN-γ and TNF-α. this could exacerbate blood nerve barrier breakdown that has been increasingly implicated in inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies (IDNs).

Part I: A brief historical perspective,2018,Frank H Gleason and Agostina V Marano and Osu Lilje and Lene Lange,32,,1,26-33,Elsevier,The “aquatic phycomycetes” constitute an ecologically and economically important assemblage of eukaryotic microorganisms. because they share many morphological traits and important ecological functions and they interact with each other in aquatic ecosystems. The last two decades of research have provided both molecular and structural evidence that the “aquatic phycomycetes” are a diverse. polyphyletic grouping and therefore not a valid taxonomic entity. Very little research has been conducted for many years with the “aquatic phycomycetes”. possibly because in general these microorganisms are often hard to isolate and maintain in most laboratory facilities. little background data has been available to identify the species. the studies were time consuming. the state of the art technology in many cases did not permit studies on these groups and they were thought to be economically and ecologically …,True,dwFklHgAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1749461317300520,13249367708776188869,/scholar?cites=13249367708776188869,,,0,0,0

In this study. we developed a pyrosequencing approach to extensively explore the diversity and dynamics of fungal and prokaryotic populations in CF lower airways.   Methodology and Principal Findings Fungi and bacteria diversity in eight sputum samples collected from four adult CF patients was investigated using conventional microbiological culturing and high-throughput pyrosequencing approach targeting the ITS2 locus and the 16S rDNA gene. The unveiled microbial community structure was compared to the clinical profile of the CF patients. Pyrosequencing confirmed recently reported bacterial diversity and observed complex fungal communities. in which more than 60% of the species or genera were not detected by cultures. Strikingly. the diversity and species richness of fungal and bacterial communities was significantly lower in patients with decreased lung function and poor clinical status.

The dysbiosis theory. reviewed by Tamboli et al (Gut 2004; 53: 1). is that an imbalance between putative ‘‘harmful’’versus ‘‘protective’’bacterial species may promote chronic intestinal inflammation. Although several studies published so far support this hypothesis. the most vexing question posed by Tamboli et al remains ‘‘what is the origin of dysbiosis?’’. Bacteriophages outnumber bacteria by a factor of 10 in many natural ecosystems. exert a strong influence on bacterial diversity and population structure. and are probably involved in dysbiosis by destabilising bacterial communities. 1 They could be involved indirectly through gene transfer and genome reorganisation within the bacterial population or directly as immunomodulating agents2 or by steric competition for microbe-associated molecular patterns …,True,F_JLEBcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,197,https://gut.bmj.com/content/57/3/424.short,12895099187715037189,/scholar?cites=12895099187715037189,,https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/57/3/424.full.pdf,0,0,0

Based on host-specific interactions. the presence of specific clades among hosts suggests the existence of freshwater-specific viral clades. Yet. little is known about the composition and diversity of the temperate freshwater viral communities. and even if freshwater lakes and marine waters harbor distinct clades for particular viral sub-families. this distinction remains to be demonstrated on a community scale. To help identify the characteristics and potential specificities of freshwater viral communities. such communities from two lakes differing by their ecological parameters were studied through metagenomics. Both the cluster richness and the species richness of the Lake Bourget virome were significantly higher that those of the Lake Pavin. highlighting a trend similar to the one observed for microorganisms (i.e. the specie richness observed in mesotrophic lakes is greater than the one observed in oligotrophic lakes). Using 29 previously published viromes. the cluster richness was shown to vary between different environment types and appeared significantly higher in marine ecosystems than in other biomes. Furthermore. significant genetic similarity between viral communities of related environments was highlighted as freshwater. marine and hypersaline environments were separated from each other despite the vast geographical distances between sample locations within each of these biomes.

This review considers some of the significant environmental factors affecting growth and population composition of chytrids in aquatic habitats. The physical factors include primarily salinity. dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature. The biological factors include the role of chytrids as saprobes and parasites and methods of dispersal of propagules throughout the ecosystem. Dispersal depends upon both zoospores for short range and whole thalli for long range dispersal. Five roles for chytrids in food-web dynamics are proposed: (1) chytrid zoospores are a good food source for zooplankton. (2) chytrids decompose particulate organic matter.

We present an original 18S rDNA survey of freshwater picoeukaryotes sampled during spring/summer 2005. complementing an earlier study conducted in autumn 2004 in Lake Pavin (France). These studies were designed to detect the small unidentified heterotrophic flagellates (HF. 0.6–5 µm) which are considered the main bacterivores in aquatic systems. Alveolates. Fungi and Stramenopiles represented 65% of the total diversity and differed from the dominant groups known from microscopic studies. Fungi and Telonemia taxa were restricted to the oxic zone which displayed two fold more operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than the oxycline. Temporal forcing also appeared as a driving force in the diversification within targeted organisms. Several sequences were not similar to those in databases and were considered as new or unsampled taxa. some of which may be typical of freshwater environments. Two taxa known from marine systems. the genera Telonema and Amoebophrya. were retrieved for the first time in our freshwater study. The analysis of potential trophic strategies displayed among the targeted HF highlighted the dominance of parasites and saprotrophs. and provided indications that these organisms have probably been wrongfully regarded as bacterivores in previous studies.

We performed three. 1‐week in situ experiments in March‐April (expt 1). May (expt 2) and August (expt 3) 2003 in order to assess protozoan and virus‐induced mortality of heterotrophic bacteria in a French lake. Viral and bacterial abundances were obtained using flow cytometry (FCM) while protozoa were counted using epifluorescence microscopy (EFM).2. A dilution approach. applied to pretreated grazer‐free samples. allowed us to estimate that viral lysis could be responsible for 60% (expt 1). 35% (expt 2) and 52% (expt 3) of daily heterotrophic bacterial mortality.

1169583,Environmental bacteriophages: viruses of microbes in aquatic ecosystems,2014,Télesphore Sime-Ngando,5,,,355,Frontiers,Since the discovery 2-3 decades ago that viruses of microbes are abundant in marine ecosystems. viral ecology has grown increasingly to reach the status of a full scientific discipline in environmental sciences. A dedicated ISVM society. the International Society for Viruses of Microorganisms (http://www.isvm.org/). was recently launched. Increasing studies in viral ecology are sources of novel knowledge related to the biodiversity of living things. the functioning of ecosystems. and the evolution of the cellular world. This is because viruses are perhaps the most diverse. abundant. and ubiquitous biological entities in the biosphere. although local environmental conditions enrich for certain viral types through selective pressure. They exhibit various lifestyles that intimately depend on the deep-cellular mechanisms. and are ultimately replicated by members of all three domains of cellular life (Bacteria. Eukarya. Archaea). as well as by giant viruses of some eukaryotic cells. This establishes viral parasites as microbial killers but also as cell partners or metabolic manipulators in microbial ecology.

1169584,Phytoplankton chytridiomycosis: fungal parasites of phytoplankton and their imprints on the food web dynamics,2012,Télesphore Sime-Ngando,3,,,361,Frontiers,Parasitism is one of the earlier and common ecological interactions in the nature. occurring in almost all environments. Microbial parasites typically are characterized by their small size. short generation time. and high rates of reproduction. with simple life cycle occurring generally within a single host. They are diverse and ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems. comprising viruses. prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Recently. environmental 18S-rDNA surveys of microbial eukaryotes have unveiled major infecting agents in pelagic systems. consisting primarily of the fungal order of Chytridiales (chytrids). Chytrids are considered the earlier branch of the Eumycetes and produce motile. flagellated zoospores. characterized by a small size (2-6 µm) and a single. posterior flagellum. The existence of these dispersal propagules includes chytrids within the so-called group of zoosporic fungi. which are particularly adapted to the plankton lifestyle where they infect a wide variety of hosts. including fishes. eggs. zooplankton. algae. and other aquatic fungi but primarily freshwater phytoplankton. Related ecological implications are huge because chytrids can killed their hosts. release substrates for microbial processes. and provide nutrient-rich particles as zoospores and short fragments of filamentous inedible hosts for the grazer food chain. Furthermore. based on the observation that phytoplankton chytridiomycosis preferentially impacts the larger size species. blooms of such species (e.g. filamentous cyanobacteria) may not totally represent trophic bottlenecks. Besides. chytrid epidemics represent an important driving factor in phytoplankton seasonal successions.

Many species are subdivided into phenodemes. which often differ in cell size. shape. stria density and pattern. but may also have different ultrastructural features. In raphid diatoms these can include the form of the raphe endings. details of the pore occlusions. and the structure of the girdle. while chloroplast structure can also vary. The phenodemes can be sympatric or allopatric. In Sellaphora pupula and other species. sympatric phenodemes are reproductively isolated. It is recommended that such demes are recognized as separate species; the total number of diatom species worldwide may thus be at least 2 × 105. Use of a fine-grained classification reveals that many diatom species may be endemics. some restricted to a single lake or catchment. others to wider …,True,RbBz8RcAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,487,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-0908-8_2,3385507340427636012,/scholar?cites=3385507340427636012,,,0,0,0

As for the vast majority of phytoplankton organisms. species identification within this genus mostly relies upon morphological features. Taxa were initially identified based on cell shape and gross morphology of their composite silica cell wall. called the frustule. Yet. observations of the frustule in electron microscopy showed many additional characters for species identification and results of molecular studies have demonstrated that genetically distinct groups might exist within morpho-species. However. these studies have not addressed the biological meaning of these genetic differences.

1169601,Experimental studies on sexual reproduction in diatoms,2004,Wim Vyverman,237,,,91,,Sexual reproduction occurs in the vast majority of eukaryotic organisms and exhibits amazing constancy in its principal cytological traits (viz. meiosis. segregation. recombination. sexual fusion. karyogamy). The biological consequence of sex is ‘‘the generation of new combinations of genes by mixing genomes. or portions thereof. from diVerent individuals’’and ‘‘without the mixing produced by sex. there would not be species as we know them’’(Michod and Levin. 1988a). At the same time. sex remains paradoxical. because it is a costly process (Lewis. 1987). with uncertain benefits in the short term. Indeed. Michod and Levin (1988b) suggest that ‘‘the origin and maintenance of sex is a ‘big’(maybe the ‘biggest’) unsolved problem in evolutionary biology’’(see also Otto and Lenormand. 2002). As Stearns (1987) noted. most discussions concerning the evolution and maintenance of sex concentrate on higher (multicellular) animals and plants. Sexual reproduction must also be significant for algae and protists. however. as it is very widespread among them as well (Margulis et al.. 1990; van den Hoek et al.. 1995). There are a few exceptions. such as the euglenids. in which sexuality and meiosis have scarcely ever been reported (Walne and Kivic. 1990). but this could as easily reflect lack of study as the truth about their occurrence.Among the eukaryotic algae. the most species-rich and productive group is the diatoms (division Bacillariophyta or class Bacillariophyceae). which probably perform 20% of all photosynthetic fixation of carbon (exceeding the contribution of the rainforests) and so have a crucial role in the functioning of ‘‘ecosystem Earth’’(eg …,True,RbBz8RcAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,302,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7K8Hh5YdXVkC&oi=fnd&pg=PA91&dq=info:nufJey84VQYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=pEEHmDmcxr&sig=ThD68uyaZ9x62HHofGP7V7hZ1kQ,456332713839421342,/scholar?cites=456332713839421342,,,0,0,0

Here. the genome sequence of Blastocystis subtype (ST) 1 is presented and compared to previously published sequences for ST4 and ST7. Despite a conserved core of genes. there is unexpected diversity between these STs in terms of their genome sizes. guanine-cytosine (GC) content. intron numbers. and gene content. ST1 has 6.544 protein-coding genes. which is several hundred more than reported for ST4 and ST7. The percentage of proteins unique to each ST ranges from 6.2% to 20.5%. greatly exceeding the differences observed within parasite genera. Orthologous proteins also display extreme divergence in amino acid sequence identity between STs (i.e.. 59%–61% median identity). on par with observations of the most distantly related species pairs of parasite genera. The STs also display substantial variation in gene family distributions and sizes. especially for protein kinase and protease gene families. which could reflect differences in virulence. It remains to be seen to what extent these inter-ST differences persist at the intra-ST level. A full 26% of genes in ST1 have stop codons that are created on the mRNA level by a novel polyadenylation mechanism found only in Blastocystis.

EukRef (eukref.org) is an ongoing community-driven initiative that addresses these challenges by bringing together taxonomists with expertise spanning the eukaryotic tree of life and microbial ecologists. who use environmental sequence data to develop reliable reference databases across the diversity of microbial eukaryotes. EukRef organizes and facilitates rigorous mining and annotation of sequence data by providing protocols. guidelines. and tools. The EukRef pipeline and tools allow users interested in a particular group of microbial eukaryotes to retrieve all sequences belonging to that group from International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) (GenBank. European Nucleotide Archive [ENA]. or DBJD). to place those sequences in a phylogenetic tree. and to curate taxonomic and environmental information for the group. We provide guidelines to facilitate the process and to standardize taxonomic annotations. The final outputs of this process are (1) a reference tree and alignment.

Strategies to identify the functions of mitosomes have been limited mainly to homology detection. which is not suitable for identifying species-specific proteins and their functions. An in vivo enzymatic tagging technique based on the Escherichia coli biotin ligase (BirA) has been introduced to G. intestinalis; this method allows for the compartment-specific biotinylation of a protein of interest. Known proteins involved in the mitosomal protein import were in vivo tagged. cross-linked. and used to copurify complexes from the outer and inner mitosomal membranes in a single step. New proteins were then identified by mass spectrometry. This approach enabled the identification of highly diverged mitosomal Tim44 (GiTim44). the first known component of the mitosomal inner membrane translocase (TIM).

PC1,2016,Feifei Xu and Jon Jerlström-Hultqvist and Martin Kolisko and Alastair GB Simpson and Andrew J Roger and Staffan G Svärd and Jan O Andersson,14,BMC biology,1,1-15,BioMed Central,It is generally thought that the evolutionary transition to parasitism is irreversible because it is associated with the loss of functions needed for a free-living lifestyle. Nevertheless. free-living taxa are sometimes nested within parasite clades in phylogenetic trees. which could indicate that they are secondarily free-living. Herein. we test this hypothesis by studying the genomic basis for evolutionary transitions between lifestyles in diplomonads. a group of anaerobic eukaryotes. Most described diplomonads are intestinal parasites or commensals of various animals. but there are also free-living diplomonads found in oxygen-poor environments such as marine and freshwater sediments. All these nest well within groups of parasitic diplomonads in phylogenetic trees. suggesting that they could be secondarily free-living. We present a transcriptome study of Trepomonas sp. PC1. a diplomonad isolated from marine sediment. Analysis of the metabolic genes revealed a number of proteins involved in degradation of the bacterial membrane and cell wall. as well as an extended set of enzymes involved in carbohydrate degradation and nucleotide metabolism. Phylogenetic analyses showed that most of the differences in metabolic capacity between free-living Trepomonas and the parasitic diplomonads are due to recent acquisitions of bacterial genes via gene transfer. Interestingly. one of the acquired genes encodes a ribonucleotide reductase. which frees Trepomonas from the need to scavenge deoxyribonucleosides.

The distribution of this pathway among eukaryotes has been thought to be very limited. with only two specialized groups living in low oxygen environments (Parabasalia and Diplomonadida) known to possess the complete set of all three enzymes. We have performed an extensive survey of available sequence data in order to map the distribution of these enzymes among eukaryotes and to reconstruct their phylogenies. We have found genes for the complete pathway in almost all examined representatives of Metamonada. the anaerobic protist group that includes parabasalids and diplomonads. Phylogenetic analyses indicate the presence of the complete pathway in the last common ancestor of metamonads and heterologous transformation experiments suggest its cytosolic localization in the metamonad ancestor. Outside Metamonada. the complete pathway occurs rarely. nevertheless. it was found in representatives of most major eukaryotic clades. Phylogenetic relationships of complete pathways are consistent with the presence of the Archaea-derived ADI pathway in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes. although other evolutionary scenarios remain possible. The presence of the incomplete set of enzymes is relatively common among eukaryotes and it may be related to the fact that these enzymes are involved in other cellular processes. such as the ornithine-urea cycle.

To modulate vesicle trafficking pathways. L. pneumophila translocates effector proteins into eukaryotic cells through a Type IVB macro-molecular transport system called the Icm-Dot system. In this study. we employed a fluorescence-based translocation assay to show that 33 previously identified Legionella eukaryotic-like genes (leg) encode substrates of the Icm-Dot secretion system. To assess which of these proteins may contribute to the disruption of vesicle trafficking. we expressed each gene in yeast and looked for phenotypes related to vacuolar protein sorting. We found that LegC3-GFP and LegC7/YlfA-GFP caused the mis-secretion of CPY-Invertase. a fusion protein normally restricted to the yeast vacuole. We also found that LegC7/YlfA-GFP and its paralog LegC2/YlfB-GFP formed large structures around the yeast vacuole while LegC3-GFP localized to the plasma membrane and a fragmented vacuole. In mammalian cells. LegC2/YlfB-GFP and LegC7/YlfA-GFP were found within large structures that co-localized with anti-KDEL antibodies but excluded the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. similar to what is observed in Legionella-containing vacuoles.

Recent reports indicate that mutations in the CCHC motifs are deleterious for reverse transcription in vivo. To identify reverse transcriptase (RT) reactions affected by such changes. we have probed zinc finger functions in NC-dependent RT-catalyzed HIV-1 minus- and plus-strand transfer model systems. Our approach was to examine the activities of wild-type NC and a mutant in which all six cysteine residues were replaced by serine (SSHS NC); this mutation severely disrupts zinc coordination. We find that the zinc fingers contribute to the role of NC in complete tRNA primer removal from minus-strand DNA during plus-strand transfer.

In some modern classifications. they are classified as a subkingdom among the Protista (eukary otic single-celled organisms). Although they are not considered a formal cate gory by some taxonomists and some biologists consider the name inappropriate (inferring that they are the first unicellular animals. although some photosynthe size). it is still convenient to consider this group of organisms as an informal collection under the heading of protozoa. Their cosmopolitan distribution. sig nificant ecological role in mineral recycling and enhancement of carbon flow through lower trophic levels of food webs. and remarkable cellular adaptations to enhance survival in diverse environments make them significant organisms for biological investigation. In some cases. biologists are introduced to this group in first level courses or in invertebrate zoology. but never develop a full appreciation for the diverse and biologically sophisticated characteristics of these organisms.

It is a scientific revolution built upon the tools of molecular biology. with which we probe and prod the living world in ways unimaginable a few decades ago. Need to track a bacterium at the root of a hospital outbreak? No problem: the offending germ's complete genetic profile can be obtained in 24 hours. We insert human DNA into E. coli bacteria to produce our insulin. It is natural to look at biotechnology in the 21st century with a mix of wonder and fear. But biotechnology is not as' unnatural'as one might think. All living organisms use the same molecular processes to replicate their genetic material and the same basic code to'read'their genes. The similarities can be seen in their DNA. Here. John Archibald shows how evolution has been'plugging-and-playing'with the subcellular components of life from the very beginning and continues to do so today. For evidence. we need look no further than the inner workings of our own cells. Molecular biology has allowed us to gaze back more than three billion years. revealing the microbial mergers and acquisitions that underpin the development of complex life.

Group I chaperonins (called GroEL/cpn60/hsp60) are found in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles. while group II chaperonins are present in archaea and the cytoplasm of eukaryotes (called CCT/TriC). While archaea possess one to three chaperonin subunit–encoding genes. eight distinct CCT gene families (paralogs) have been characterized in eukaryotes. We are interested in determining when during eukaryotic evolution the multiple gene duplications producing the CCT subunits occurred. We describe the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of five CCT genes from Trichomonas vaginalis and seven from Giardia lamblia. representatives of amitochondriate protist lineages thought to have diverged early from other eukaryotes.

Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic. as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness. and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e.. the assignment of species to phylum. class. order. family. and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa. and when applied to all domains of life. it predicts ∼8.7 million (±1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally. of which ∼2.2 million (±0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database. our results suggest that some 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean still await description.

Recent improvements in the taxon sampling for nuclear rRNA genes and several protein markers have transformed this understanding. Parasitism evolved at least four times in kinetoplastids. Obligate parasitic trypanosomatids are a relatively ‘derived’ group within kinetoplastids; their closest relative is likely to be the free-living Bodo saltans. and the ancestral trypanosomatids were probably parasites of insects. Although subject to recent controversy. trypanosomes (genus Trypanosoma) probably constitute a monophyletic group. Several unusual features of trypanosomatid genomes (e.g. trans-splicing. mitochondrial RNA editing and intron poverty) are common in kinetoplastids and pre-date the adoption of parasitism.

However. the tree has been profoundly rearranged during this time.

The goals of this research were to provide insights into: 1) the responses of American oysters to R. crassostreae. and 2) potential mechanisms of resistance or susceptibility to ROD. The responses of oysters to bacterial challenge were characterized by exposing oysters from ROD-resistant and susceptible families to R. crassostreae. followed by high-throughput sequencing of cDNA samples from various timepoints after disease challenge. Sequence data was assembled into a reference transcriptome and analyzed through differential gene expression and functional enrichment to uncover genes and processes potentially involved in responses to ROD in the American oyster. While susceptible oysters experienced constant levels of mortality when challenged with R. crassostreae. resistant oysters showed levels of mortality similar to non-challenged oysters. Oysters exposed to R. crassostreae showed differential expression of transcripts involved in immune recognition. signaling. protease inhibition. detoxification. and apoptosis.

This is evident in many parasites. but perhaps the most extreme transitions are from free-living autotrophic algae to obligate parasites. The best-known examples of this are the apicomplexans such as Plasmodium. which evolved from algae with red secondary plastids. However. an analogous transition also took place independently in the Helicosporidia. where an obligate parasite of animals with an intracellular infection mechanism evolved from algae with green primary plastids. We characterised the nuclear genome of Helicosporidium to compare its transition to parasitism with that of apicomplexans. The Helicosporidium genome is small and compact. even by comparison with the relatively small genomes of the closely related green algae Chlorella and Coccomyxa. but at the functional level we find almost no evidence for reduction. Nearly all ancestral metabolic functions are retained. with the single major exception of photosynthesis. and even here reduction is not complete. The great majority of genes for light-harvesting complexes. photosystems. and pigment biosynthesis have been lost. but those for other photosynthesis-related functions. such as Calvin cycle. are retained. Rather than loss of whole function categories. the predominant reductive force in the Helicosporidium genome is a contraction of gene family complexity. but even here most losses affect families associated with genome maintenance and expression. not functions associated with host-dependence …,True,E05atB4AAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,52,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004355,10220131316310759497,/scholar?cites=10220131316310759497,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004355,0,0,0

Despite having evolved independently of one another. the nucleomorph genomes of cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes are strikingly similar in size and basic structure. Both are <1 Mbp in size—the smallest nuclear genomes known—and are composed of only 3 chromosomes. each with its own subtelomeric rDNA repeats. Nucleomorph-containing algae thus represent an interesting system in which to study genome and chromosome evolution in eukaryotes.

Cryptophytes are unusual in that they possess four genomes–a host cell-derived nuclear and mitochondrial genome and an endosymbiont-derived plastid and 'nucleomorph' genome. The evolutionary origins of the host and endosymbiont components of cryptophyte algae are at present poorly understood. Thus far. a single complete mitochondrial genome sequence has been determined for the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina. Here. the second complete mitochondrial genome of the cryptophyte alga Hemiselmis andersenii CCMP644 is presented. The H. andersenii mtDNA is 60.553 bp in size and encodes 30 structural RNAs and 36 protein-coding genes. all located on the same strand. A prominent feature of the genome is the presence of a ~20 Kbp long intergenic region comprised of numerous tandem and dispersed repeat units of between 22–336 bp. Adjacent to these repeats are 27 copies of palindromic sequences predicted to form stable DNA stem-loop structures. One such stem-loop is located near a GC-rich and GC-poor region and may have a regulatory function in replication or transcription. The H. andersenii mtDNA shares a number of features in common with the genome of the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina. including general architecture. gene content. and the presence of a large repeat region. However. the H. andersenii mtDNA is devoid of inverted repeats and introns. which are present in R. salina.

The nuclear genome of the red alga persists in a highly reduced form termed a nucleomorph. The nucleomorph genome of the model cryptomonad Guillardia theta has been completely sequenced and is a mere 551 kilobases (kb) in size. spread over three chromosomes. The presence of three chromosomes appears to be a universal characteristic of nucleomorph genomes in cryptomonad algae as well as in the chlorarachniophytes. an unrelated algal lineage with a nucleomorph and plastid genome derived from a green algal endosymbiont.

Red algal parasites alone have independently evolved over 100 times. The accepted evolutionary paradigm proposes that red algal parasites arise by first infecting a close relative and over time diversifying and infecting more distantly related species. This provides a natural evolutionary gradient of relationships between hosts and parasites that share a photosynthetic common ancestor. Upon infection. the parasite deposits its organelles into the host cell and takes over. spreading through cell‐cell connections. Microscopy and molecular studies have demonstrated that the parasites do not maintain their own plastid. but rather abscond with a dedifferentiated host plastid as they pack up spores for dispersal.

Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic. as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness. and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e.. the assignment of species to phylum. class. order. family. and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa. and when applied to all domains of life. it predicts ∼8.7 million (±1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally. of which ∼2.2 million (±0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database. our results suggest that some 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean still await description.

Our review is intended to help non-specialists navigate through the literature. as the names used to describe protists have changed greatly over the past three decades. It provides a review of the various primers used to amplify soil protists. many of which have been published under multiple names. and their differences.

These observations on the decomposer food webs were compared with knowledge of vegetation and soil microstructure development from previous studies. The amount of carbon entering the food web increased with succession age in a similar way as the total amount of C in food web biomass and the number of functional groups in the food web. Connectance did not show any significant changes with succession age. however. In early stages of the succession. the bacterial channel dominated the food web. Later on. in shrub-dominated stands. the fungal channel took over. Even later. in the forest stage. the bacterial channel prevailed again. The best predictor of fungal bacterial ratio is thickness of fermentation layer. We argue that these changes correspond with changes in topsoil microstructure driven by a combination of plant organic matter input and engineering effects of earthworms. In early stages. soil is alkaline. and a discontinuous litter layer on the soil surface promotes bacterial biomass growth. so the bacterial food web channel can dominate. Litter accumulation on the soil surface supports the development of the fungal channel. In older stages. earthworms arrive. mix litter into the mineral soil and form an organo-mineral topsoil. which is beneficial for bacteria and enhances the bacterial food web channel.,True,eDqYUGQAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,26,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079694,12563725216573703378,/scholar?cites=12563725216573703378,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079694,0,0,0

The vast phenotypic distances between the three groups along with the enigmatic distribution of plastids and the economic and medical importance of several representative species (e.g. Plasmodium.

Recent phylogenomic analyses suggest that photosynthetic “chromalveolates” form a large clade with inclusion of several non-photosynthetic protist lineages. Katablepharids are one such non-photosynthetic lineage closely related to cryptophytes. Despite their evolutionary and ecological importance. katablepharids are poorly investigated.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here. we report a newly discovered flagellate. Roombia truncata gen. et sp. nov.. that is related to katablepharids. but is morphologically distinct from othermembers of the group in the following ways: (1) two flagella emerge from a papilla-like subapical protrusion. (2) conspicuous ejectisomes are aligned in multiple (5–11) rows. (3) each ejectisome increases in size towards the posterior end of the rows. and (4) upon feeding. a part of cytoplasm elastically stretch to engulf whole prey cell. Molecular phylogenies inferred from Hsp90. SSU rDNA. and LSU rDNA sequences consistently and strongly show R. truncata as the sister lineage to all other katablepharids. including lineages known only from environmental sequence surveys.

An emphasis on specific ancestral characteristics in marine gregarines has given the group a reputation of being ‘primitive.’ Although some lineages have retained characteristics inferred to be ancestral for the group. and perhaps apicomplexans as a whole. most gregarines represent highly derived parasites with novel ultrastructural and behavioral adaptations. Many marine gregarines have become giants among single-celled organisms and have evolved ornate surface structures.

Chloroplasts are present in some euglenids. which are closely related to trypanosomatids. and it has been argued that chloroplasts arose early in the diversification of the lineage Euglenozoa. to which trypanosomatids and euglenids belong (plastids-early hypothesis). This article reviews how euglenid ultrastructural systems are functionally integrated and phylogenetically correlated.

The increasing sensitivity of molecular methods and growing interest in microeukaryotes has only recently demonstrated that many features so far considered to be universal for eukaryotes actually exist in strikingly different versions. In other words. during their long evolutionary histories. protists have solved general biological problems in many more ways than previously appreciated. Interestingly. some groups have broken more rules than others. and the Euglenozoa and the Alveolata stand out in this respect.

Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences provide phylogenetic signals only at the tips of the dinoflagellate tree. Two reasons for the poor resolution of deep dinoflagellate relationships using rDNA sequences are (1) most sites are relatively conserved and (2) there are different evolutionary rates among sites in different lineages. Therefore. alternative molecular markers are required to address the deeper phylogenetic relationships among dinoflagellates. Preliminary evidence indicates that the heat shock protein 90 gene (Hsp90) will provide an informative marker. mainly because this gene is relatively long and appears to have relatively uniform rates of evolution in different lineages.  Methodology/Principal Findings We more than doubled the previous dataset of Hsp90 sequences from dinoflagellates by generating additional sequences from 17 different species. representing seven different orders. In order to concatenate the Hsp90 data with rDNA sequences. we supplemented the Hsp90 sequences with three new SSU rDNA sequences and five new LSU rDNA sequences. The new Hsp90 sequences were generated. in part. from four additional heterotrophic dinoflagellates and the type species for six different genera.

The group consists of three main subclades – euglenids. kinetoplastids and diplonemids – that have been confirmed with both molecular phylogenetic analyses and a combination of shared ultrastructural characteristics. Several poorly understood lineages of putative euglenozoans live in anoxic environments. such as Calkinsia aureus. and have yet to be characterized at the molecular and ultrastructural levels. Improved understanding of these lineages is expected to shed considerable light onto the ultrastructure of prokaryote-eukaryote symbioses and the associated cellular innovations found within the Euglenozoa and beyond. We collected Calkinsia aureus from core samples taken from the low-oxygen seafloor of the Santa Barbara Basin (580 – 592 m depth). California. These biflagellates were distinctively orange in color and covered with a dense array of elongated epibiotic bacteria. Serial TEM sections through individually prepared cells demonstrated that C. aureus shares derived ultrastructural features with other members of the Euglenozoa (e.g. the same paraxonemal rods. microtubular root system and extrusomes). However. C. aureus also possessed several novel ultrastructural systems. such as modified mitochondria (i.e. hydrogenosome-like). an ""extrusomal pocket"". a highly organized extracellular matrix beneath epibiotic bacteria and a complex flagellar transition zone.

The physiological adaptations required for an organism to pass the salinity barrier are considerable. Many eukaryotic lineages are restricted to either freshwater or marine environments. Molecular phylogenetic analyses generally demonstrate that freshwater species and marine species segregate into different sub-clades. indicating that transitions between these two environments occur only rarely in the course of evolution. It is. however. unclear if the transitions between freshwater and environments characterized by highly variable salinities. such as the marine supralittoral zone. are also infrequent. Here. we use testate amoebae within the Euglyphida to assess the phylogenetic interrelationships between marine supralittoral and freshwater taxa.

The monophyly of dinoflagellates has been convincingly demonstrated. but the interrelationships among dinoflagellate lineages still remain largely unresolved. Warnowiid dinoflagellates are among the most remarkable eukaryotes known because of their possession of highly elaborate ultrastructural systems: pistons. nematocysts. and ocelloids. Complex organelles like these are evolutionary innovations found only in a few athecate dinoflagellates. Moreover. the taxonomy of warnowiids is extremely confusing and inferences about the evolutionary history of this lineage are mired by the absence of molecular phylogenetic data from any member of the group. In this study. we provide the first molecular phylogenetic data for warnowiids and couple them with a review of warnowiid morphological features in order to formulate a hypothetical framework for understanding character evolution within the group. These data also enabled us to evaluate the evolutionary relationship(s) between warnowiids and the other group of dinoflagellates with complex organelles: polykrikoids. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of SSU and LSU rDNA sequences demonstrated that warnowiids form a well-supported clade that falls within the more inclusive Gymnodinium sensu stricto clade. These data also confirmed that polykrikoids are members of the Gymnodinium sensu stricto clade as well; however. a specific sister relationship between the warnowiid clade and the polykrikoid clade was unresolved in all of our analyses.

1169808,Fungal communities in wet tropical forests: variation in time and space,1995,D Jean Lodge and Sharon Cantrell,73,Canadian Journal of Botany,S1,1391-1398,NRC Research Press,Understanding variation in tropical forest fungal populations and communities is important for assessing fungal biodiversity. as well as for understanding the regulatory roles fungi play in tropical forests. In wet tropical forests. the canopy is typically occupied by certain wood decomposers. endophytes. epiphylls. and pathogens. Aphyllophoraceous canopy fungi are a subset of species found in the understory. Marasmioid agarics in the understory often form extensive networks of rhizomorphs that trap litter; these and other aerial species are rare on the forest floor. Decomposers are stratified within the forest floor. with some species colonizing only fresh litter. others preferring decomposed litter. and others restricted to soil organic matter. Specificity to particular host substrates is frequent among tropical forest litter decomposers and contributes to spatial heterogeneity in fungal communities over the landscape.

1169810,Factors related to diversity of decomposer fungi in tropical forests,1997,D Jean Lodge,6,Biodiversity & Conservation,5,681-688,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Recent studies suggest that host-preferences are common among certain groups of tropical fungal decomposers but rare in others. and sometimes occur where we least expect them. Host preferences among microfungi and ascomycetes that decompose leaf litter are common but usually involve differences in relative frequencies more than presence/absence. so their diversity may be loosely correlated with species richness of host trees. Strong host-specificity appears to be rare among wood decomposer fungi. whereas characteristics of their substrata and habitat are very important for this group. Anthropogenic disturbance predisposed a tropical forest to subsequent hurricane damage. and the resulting direct and indirect effects on host diversity and habitat heterogeneity were reflected in the decomposer fungal community more than sixty years after the original disturbance.

Although a moisture gradient experiment showed endomycorrhizal formation was greater in moist soil than in very dry or flooded soils. this pattern was reversed in field transects along drainage gradients. Infection by VA-endomycorrhizal fungi in the field was the lowest where infection by ectomycorrhizal fungi was high. which suggests possible antagonism among the fungal symbionts.

We emphasize project planning and techniques for collecting and documenting specimens and data. We also provide some ideas for monitoring populations of macrofungi. but such activities have been attempted so rarely that little information is available. Macrofungi are distinguished by having fruiting structures (sporocarps) visible to the naked eye. Most macrofungi are Ascomycota or Basidiomycota. but a few are Zygomycota. Most terrestrial macrofungi are saprobes or mycorrhizal symbionts. but some are pathogens of plants. animals. or fungi. Fungi fruiting on woody substrata are usually either saprobes or plant pathogens. The primary feature that distinguishes the ascomycetes covered in this chapter from the ascomycetes treated as microfungi later in the book is their visibility on the substratum surface. All of the ascomycetes referred to here have fruiting structures that are visible with the naked eye. with a hand lens. or under a stereomicroscope. For the most part. a moist chamber is not used to observe or induce fruiting of these species. Much of the information on microfungi. covered in Chapters 7. 11. and 12. such as limitations on their study and their taxonomic and biotic statuses. is equally relevant to the ascomycetes treated in this section. We do not specifically consider lichenized fungi (see Chapter 9). plant or animal pathogens (see Chapters 7 and 19).

Growth of these opportunistic microalgae is believed to be promoted by sudden input of nutrients and the absence or inefficiency of their natural enemies. such as grazers and parasites. Here. numerical simulations indicate that increasing nutrient availability not only promotes the formation of dinoflagellate blooms but can also stimulate their control by protozoan parasites. Moreover. high abundance of phytoplankton other than dinoflagellate hosts might have a significant dilution effect on the control of dinoflagellate blooms by parasites. either by resource competition with dinoflagellates (thus limiting the number of hosts available for infection) or by affecting numerical-functional responses of grazers that consume free-living parasite stages.

Estuaries are highly variable environments and the processes listed above can influence phytoplankton dynamics not only seasonally (MACEDO et al.. 2001; IGNATIADES et al.. 2002) but also during tidal cycles (GOOSEN et al.. 1999; BRUNET; LIZON. 2003). Tidal stirring constitutes a relevant driving force affecting phytoplankton distribution. since it induces substantial horizontal and vertical mixing of the water column. as well as upstream and downstream displacement of water masses along the main longitudinal estuarine axis. While horizontal mixing has more mechanical effects on phytoplankton (LEGENDRE; DEMERS. 1984). vertical mixing can affect phytoplankton physiology and growth due to its strong impact on the availability of nutrients and light (DEMERS et al.. 1979).Overall. tidal forcing is responsible for short-term changes in phytoplankton biomass. specific composition. growth and primary production (WETZ et al.. 2006). These effects are especially important in shallow tidally-driven estuarine systems (CLOERN. 1991; WETZ et al.. 2006) and different authors have been studying patterns of primary production on this time scale (JOUENNE et al.. 2005; HELBLING et al.. 2010). but it is also interesting to get some insights on changes in phytoplankton composition (BUCCI et al.. 2012; MOSER et al.. 2012).,True,ZS87GDQAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,9,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-87592014000400341&script=sci_arttext,1496196351446156600,/scholar?cites=1496196351446156600,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-87592014000400341&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

Based on the drastic oceanographic anomalies observed in the Chilean fjords during the 2016-El Niño“Godzilla”event. the role of salinity(15to35psu) on Pseudochattonella cell growth and cytotoxicity was studied by culturing. scanning-electron-microscopy(SEM) and using a rainbow trout cell line RTgill-W1 assay to define:(1)vegetative growth rates. (2)cell taxonomy. (3)ichthyotoxicity of monoclonal cultures at 25 and 35 psu in salinity. (4)differences in toxicity of lysed cells and supernatant at different cell concentrations (from 10to100.000cells ml-1) and (5)temporal stability of lytic compounds. This study formally confirms the presence of P.verruculosa in Chilean waters using the large subunit(LSU) of the nuclear ribosomal RNAgene. The Chilean ARC498-strain showed maximum cell densities at 30 psu (max. 84.333±4.833cellsml-1) and maximum growth rates (max) at 20 psu (1.44cellsd-1).

A realized subniche approach based on the Within Outlying Mean Index (WitOMI) was used to decompose the species’ realized niche into realized subniches (found within subsets of environmental conditions). The interannual distribution of both D. acuminata and P. reticulatum summer blooms was strongly influenced by climatological regional events. ie. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annual Mode (SAM). The two species showed distinct niche preferences. with blooms of D. acuminata occurring under La Niña conditions (cold years) and low river streamflow whereas P. reticulatum blooms were observed in years of El Niño conditions and positive SAM phase. The biological constraint exerted on the species was further estimated based on the difference between the existing fundamental subniche and the realized subniche. The observed patterns suggested that D. acuminata was subject to strong biological constraint during the studied period. probably as a result of low cell densities of its putative prey (the mixotrophic ciliate Mesodinium cf. rubrum) usually observed in the studied area.

Seven Alexandrium species have been recorded from Brazil so far: A. catenella. A. fraterculus. A. gaardnerae. A. kutnerae. A. tamiyavanichi. A. tamutum. and Alexandrium sp. While A. gaardnerae and A. kutnerae were identified based only on morphological characteristics. phylogenetic analysis (ITS and LSU rDNA) were performed for the remaining species based on cultures and/or field populations. Monoclonal cultures of the analyzed species were isolated from field samples obtained from Bahia (A. tamiyavanichi. two strains). Rio de Janeiro (A. tamutum. three strains; Alexandrium sp.. two strains). Santa Catarina (A. fraterculus. one strain) and Rio Grande do Sul (A. tamarense. three strains). This is the first record of A. tamutum for the South Atlantic. In addition. molecular data for Brazilian strains of A. fraterculus are presented for the first time. as well as sequences from the ITS region for A. catenella (previously reported as A. tamarense) from Brazilian coastal waters. The morphological characters of the three species corresponded to those typically recorded in the literature and their identification was confirmed by molecular analysis. Based on the LSU rDNA and ITS regions. the three strains of A. catenella showed a high degree of similarity with strains from Southern Chile and North America.

There is considerable level of species-specific synchrony in population fluctuations among the localities. The degree of synchrony levels off with increasing distance among the populations compared. Climatic perturbations and dispersal have been proposed as pace-making factors for synchrony. According to Moran’s theorem. local populations sharing a common structure of density dependence should become synchronized under the influence of a spatially correlated density-independent factor. This predicts synchrony to decay slower with increasing distance between local populations than if the synchrony is caused by dispersal.

We present a model to determine whether a specific case of mate choice — preference for old mates — can be justified by viability selection in mutation—selection balance only. or whether biotic interactions or random variations in the environment are necessary to maintain the preference if the age of the male does not yield any direct benefit for the female. The results of the model. considering multiple polygenic viability-related traits. show that choosiness will be favoured with any positive mutation rate. but the advantage will be slightly reduced rather than enhanced in the case of a Red Queen type process.

The prevailing view is that the most plausible candidates to explain this pattern are extrinsic disturbances (the Moran effect) and dispersal. In most cases disentangling these factors is difficult. Theoretical studies have shown that dispersal between subpopulations is more likely to produce a negative relationship between population synchrony and distance between the patches than perturbations. As analyses of empirical data frequently show this negative relationship between the level of synchrony and distance between populations. this has emphasized the importance of dispersal as a synchronizing agent.

1169862,Habitat heterogeneity affects population growth in goshawk Accipiter gentilis,2001,Oliver Krüger and Jan Lindström,70,Journal of animal Ecology,2,173-181,Blackwell Science Ltd,  1 The concept of site‐dependent population regulation combines the ideas of Ideal Free Distribution‐type of habitat settlement and density dependence in a vital rate mediated by habitat heterogeneity. The latter is also known as habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Site‐dependent population regulation hypothesis predicts that increasing population density should lead to inhabitation of increasingly poor territories and decreasing per capita population growth rate.

There is. however. no unique way to measure inequality. We review 21 measures used to quantify it and clarify the conceptual difference between inequality and skewness. In two very different families of distributions. all indices except three give higher values for more unequal distributions of resources. although some of them are poor at distinguishing between similar inequality values. When applied correctly by testing against a null hypothesis of no inequality among individuals. most indices can therefore be used to detect deviations from randomness. but with varying ease as most lack statistical tables and rely on resampling techniques instead.

The three species are known to display cyclic dynamics with a periodicity of approximately six yr. Synchrony in species-specific population fluctuations was scored by calculating cross correlations with zero lag among all the provinces.

To enable the statistical analysis. the number of the 12 climate variables was reduced to three non-correlating principal components.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1395,483-488,The Royal Society,Most models of population dynamics do not take sexual reproduction into account (i.e. they do not consider the role of males). However. assumptions behind this practice—that no demographic sex differences exist and males are always abundant enough to fertilize all the females—are usually not justified in natural populations. On the contrary. demographic sex differences are common. especially in polygynous species. Previous models that consider sexual reproduction report a stabilizing effect through mixing of different genotypes. thus suggesting a decrease in the propensity for complex dynamics in sexually reproducing populations. Here we show that considering the direct role of males in reproduction and density dependence leads to the conclusion that a two–sex model is not necessarily more stable compared with the corresponding one–sex model.

However. there are surprisingly few empirical demonstrations that such association preferences predict the likelihood of females reproducing with a particular male. This information is essential to confirm association preferences as good predictors of mate choice. We used green swordtails (Xiphophorus helleri) to test whether association preferences predict the likelihood of a female reproducing with a male. Females were tested for a preference for long- or short-sworded males in a standard dichotomous choice experiment and then allowed free access to either their preferred or non-preferred male.

The light and dark morphs have a much lower fitness than the presumed heterozygous intermediate morph. but are replenished through Mendelian segregation in intermediate‐intermediate pairs. Light and dark morphs could maximize their fitness by mating light with dark to produce all intermediate offspring. but instead choose partners of their own color. thereby producing broods of minimally fit homozygotes. Such maladaptive behavior argues forcefully against mate choice based on “good genes.” and its persistence is best explained by heterozygote advantage maintaining the polymorphism coupled with nongenetic mate choice based on sexual imprinting.

The process by which a male can obtain a central territory has been especially lacking a quantitative analysis. We present a stochastic queuing model describing territory succession toward the lek center and apply it to a 8-year sequence of territory centrality measures on a black grouse Tetrao tetrix lek. The lek shows a value of intermediate queue discipline. which deviates significantly both from strict orderly queuing and from random ranking of males. Thus. high-ranking males are partly able to maintain their superior position over years. but queue-jumping is not excluded; especially because highly succesful males do not attempt to change their territory position toward the lek center.

Because of this. social selection has been described as a process distinct from other forms of natural selection. Social selection has been predicted to result in different evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes. including rapid or extreme evolution and evolution of altruism. Despite the critical role that social selection plays in theories of social evolution. few studies have measured the force of social selection or the conditions under which this force changes. Here we present a model of social selection acting on interacting phenotypes that can be evaluated independently from the genetics of interacting phenotypes.

Under the optimality approach popula-tions are considered to be at or very near a stable intermediate opti-mum for the characters being studied. Dynamic programming. game theoretical. or other optimality models and approaches are used to identify an expected character state. The behavior of the animal under study is then judged in relation to this theoretical optimum. Thus. it is the outcome. or expected outcome. that is of interest using this approach. The outcome is of course predicted based on the current behavior of animals. While this approach has considerable appeal. and has been very powerful in understanding initially perplexing behavior (eg. Maynard Smith 1982; Krebs and Davies 1991). it does not always explain the observed patterns of behavior (Rose. Service. and Hutchinson 1987; Riechert 1993). De-viation of the population from optimal behavior is usually seen as a failure of the specific optimality model employed. necessitating revisions of the model or tests of the assumptions (Krebs and Ka-celnik 1991). Interestingly. the possibility that the population is not in equilibrium is rarely considered (but see Riechert 1993 for an exception).Optimality approaches need not be evolutionary (Rose. Service. and Hutchinson 1987) since optimality theories do not specifically require that a process be considered.

Males compete for territories. where they attract females and where mating occurs. Female behavior influences both the copulation success and the fertilization success of males. Because of temporal and spatial separation of these episodes of sexual selection. multivariate and nonparametric statistical techniques could be used to investigate the influence of components of sexual selection on various sexually dimorphic traits.

Existing models predict that. should one parent reduce its care. the mate should adjust its care facultatively to compensate partially. This has been tested mostly on birds with equivocal results. To examine the generality of this prediction. we tested for facultative adjustments in care in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. where both parents regurgitate predigested carrion to their offspring. Females were considerably more involved than males in direct care of the larvae before mate removal. Males adjusted their care significantly after female removal. whereas females showed no response to male removal. Thus. only male behaviour was consistent with theoretical predictions.

1169901,Sperm competition and its evolutionary consequences in the insects.,1970,G. A. Parker,45,Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,,525-567,,The possible advantages to a species of internal rather than external fertilization have frequently been stressed. though one important point appears persistently to have escaped comment. In terms of sexual rather than natural selection. copulation with internal fertilization may have arisen by a selective advantage conferred upon males able to eject sperm nearer to the ova than did their fellow males. Such a selective advantage would still operate in situations where virtually all ova are certain of fertilization with a minimum of time delay. This view would not preclude a natural selection pressure (favouring increased chances of fertilization in minimum time) as an important determinant of internal fertilization. but the sexual selection pressure of competition between males could have been much more important in the evolution of the process.

1169902,Assessment strategy and the evolution of fighting behaviour,1974,Geoffrey A Parker,47,Journal of theoretical Biology,1,223-243,Academic Press,The view is examined that the adaptive value of conventional aspects of fighting behaviour is for assessment of relative RHP (resource holding power) of the combatants. Outcomes of aggressive disputes should be decided by each individual's fitness budget available for expenditure during a fight (determined by the fitness difference between adoption of alternative strategies. escalation or withdrawal without escalation) and on the rate of expenditure of the fitness budget if escalation occurs (determined by the RHPs of the combatants). Thus response thresholds for alternative strategies (“assessments”) will be determined by natural selection on a basis of which opponent is likely to expend its fitness budget first. should escalation occur. This “loser” should retreat (before escalation) and the winner should stay in possession of the resource.

1169903,The logic of asymmetric contests,1976,John Maynard Smith and Geoffrey A Parker,24,Animal behaviour,1,159-175,Academic Press,A theoretical analysis is made of the evolution of behavioural strategies in contest situations. It is assumed that behaviour will evolve so as to maximize individual fitness. If so. a population will evolve an ‘evolutionarily stable strategy’. or ESS. which can be defined as a strategy such that. if all members of a population adopt it. no ‘mutant’ strategy can do better. A number of simple models of contest situations are analysed from this point of view. It is concluded that in ‘symmetric’ contests the ESS is likely to be a ‘mixed’ strategy; that is. either the population will be genetically polymorphic or individuals will be behaviourally variable. Most real contests are probably asymmetric. either in pay-off to the contestants. or in size or weapons. or in some ‘uncorrelated’ fashion; i.e. in a fashion which does not substantially bias either the pay-offs or the likely outcome of an escalated contest.

Sexual selection can be divided into two major aspects:(1) direct intramale competition for females and (2) female choice."" Direct competition"" implies the sort of adaptation by which males may directly outcompete their rivals for mating opportunities with females. Examples include optimization of search strategies. development of direct guarding behavior of females. fighting between males for mating opportunities. and so on; the possibilities are legion. By"" female choice"" it is understood that the major sexual selective force on the male is determined by the female--she exerts some form of preference over which one out of a series of males she will accept for mating. Huxley doubted that sexually selected adaptations of the"" direct competition"" type could evolve if they had any ancillary selective costs to the male in terms of decreased survival chances. and he would not accept that any features of males could arise through"" female choice."" Since Huxley‘s rather dampening effect on the theory of sexual selection. there have been several insights which suggest that the extent of sexual selection may be intense and dramatic.

1169912,Sperm competition and the evolution of animal mating strategies,1984,GA Parker,,Sperm competition and the evolution of animal mating systems,,1-60,,The reproductive success of a male individual depends mainly on how many of his sperm are successful in fertilizing eggs. Thus sexual selection will not end with adaptations that relate to mating with many females. Many male adaptations—behavioral. morphological. and physiological—relate to enhancing the success of self's sperm against rival sperm. Much of sperm structure and organization can be interpreted in terms of gamete competition (Sivinski 1980; this volume). Sessile males with external fertilization may simply maximize gamete production; they may have few alternative ways of allocating reproductive effort. However. for species with internal fertilization. there exists a rich variety of sexually-selected adaptive pathways that appear to relate to enhancing the success of self’s ejaculate relative to rival ejaculates. ie. to “assure paternity”(Smith 1979a). I earlier attempted to review the main lines Of adaptation in insects to this form of sexual selection (Parker 1970a). Potential competition within the female tract between the ejaculates from rival males is likely to be intense in insects; sperm are provisioned within the sperm stores and are extremely long lived. giving much capacity for the “overlapping” of ejaculates. During the past decade it has become evident that many other groups display many and varied adaptations to sperm competition (competition between ejaculates from two or more different males over the fertilization of ova); the present book is a testament to the ubiquity of sperm competition throughout the animal kingdom.

1169913,Mate quality and mating decisions,1983,GA Parker,,Mate choice,,141,Cambridge University Press,Since the influential papers of Bateman (1948) and Trivers (1972) it has been evident that parental investment (PI) is important in determining which sex competes. and which sex is choosy. It is usual to argue that when male PI is small or negligible. males will compete and females will be choosy. Alternatively. in cases of sex role reversal in PI pattern. females compete and males are choosy.My aim in this paper is to propose that active mate choice in fact depends on an interaction between relative PI (or more accurately. investment with a given mate) and relative variance in mate quality for the two sexes. Benefits of choice are an increasing function of the variance in mate quality of the opposite sex; costs of choice relate to the time and effort needed to find an alternative mate (they will therefore decrease as the PI of the opposite sex decreases). Although genetic benefits (choice of good genes') are likely to be small or negligible. major benefits of active mate choice may arise through environmental variance in PI ability. Thus both variance in mate quality (benefit of choice) and time to find an alternative mate (costs of choice) are likely to increase with PI. a feature which greatly complicates the making of general predictions. Certainly. we should not always expect that the sex with lowest investment will be the least choosy. though this may often be the case.,True,1JmtIa8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,726,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HY-onXFuTcoC&oi=fnd&pg=PA141&dq=info:XUssQEnalOIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=wimvy1YX93&sig=wHY9-NGcwzJs56nRbSaE2VU5tdQ,16326914557269003101,/scholar?cites=16326914557269003101,,,0,0,0

These prospective models of competitive ejaculation seek ESS sperm numbers for cases when sperm competition obeys the ‘raffle principle’. In a ‘fair raffle’. each male’s fertilization probability equals his sperm number divided by the total sperm number in the female tract. In a loaded raffle. one male’s sperm are ‘devalued’ relative to his competitor. e. g. a sperm from the second male to mate counts as only (say) half of a ticket in the fertilization lottery compared with one of the first male’s sperm.

This assumes that a fixed amount of reserve material is necessary for development of the zygote and that only disassortative fusions occur (i.e. between small and large gametes).Assuming (as in previous literature) that a given gametic mass can be produced in unit time. then individual variations in gamete size may arise either from differences in the production time. or in the number of cell divisions at the time of production.

The sexes can have different trait optima but this need not imply conflict if their optima can be attained simultaneously.

Overt behavioural conflict may or may not be manifest at resolution.

1169923,Why are there so many tiny sperm? Sperm competition and the maintenance of two sexes,1982,Geoffrey A Parker,96,Journal of theoretical biology,2,281-294,Academic Press,It is suggested that sperm competition (competition between the sperm from two or more males over the fertilization of ova) may account for the fact that sperm are so small and so numerous. In the entire absence of sperm competition. selection may favour an increase in sperm size so that the sperm contributes nutriment to the subsequent viability and success of the zygote. However. an extremely low incidence of sperm competition is adequate to prevent sperm size increasing. Vertebrate sperm should remain at minimal size provided that double matings (one female mated by two males) occur more often than about 4 times the ratio of sperm size: ovum size. The classical theory that sperm are small simply because of the difficulties of ensuring that ova do get fertilized may also explain sperm size. and both effects (sperm competition and ensuring fertilization) are likely to contribute to the stability of anisogamy.

1169924,Courtship persistence and female-guarding as male time investment strategies,1974,Geoffrey A Parker,48,Behaviour,1-4,157-183,Brill,Time investment strategy is defined as the optimum allocation of times spent on given activities so as to achieve maximum reproductive success. Selective pressures on males to increase time invested in encountering females would be least in sessile and communally spawning species. and maximum in mobile species which spawn at low density and those which copulate. The present paper concerns male time investment in courtship persistence and female-guarding. Staying with a given female reduces the rate at which new females are encountered. Females are often unreceptive for some time after mating. Males often court unreceptive conspecific females; they can achieve a gain if the female rejection reactions can be overcome (rape) and the ejaculate can compete in the fertilization of the ova. Courtship of unreceptive females of closely related sympatric species is also considered adaptive.

1169925,Sexual conflict and speciation,1998,GA Parker and L Partridge,353,,1366,261-274,The Royal Society,We review the significance of two forms of sexual conflict (different evolutionary interests of the two sexes) for genetic differentiation of populations and the evolution of reproductive isolation. Conflicting selection on the alleles at a single locus can occur in males and females if the sexes have different optima for a trait. and there are pleiotropic genetic correlations between the sexes for it. There will then be selection for sex limitation and hence sexual dimorphism. This sex limitation could break down in hybrids and reduce their fitness. Pleiotropic genetic correlations between the sexes could also affect the likelihood of mating in interpopulation encounters. Conflict can also occur between (sex–limited) loci that determine behaviour in males and those that determine behaviour in females. Reproductive isolation may occur by rapid coevolution of male trait and female mating preference.

1169926,Sperm competition and ejaculate economics,2010,Geoff A Parker and Tommaso Pizzari,85,,4,897-934,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Sperm competition was identified in 1970 as a pervasive selective force in post‐copulatory sexual selection that occurs when the ejaculates of different males compete to fertilise a given set of ova. Since then. sperm competition has been much studied both empirically and theoretically. Because sperm competition often favours large ejaculates. an important challenge has been to understand the evolution of strategies through which males invest in sperm production and economise sperm allocation to maximise reproductive success under competitive conditions. Sperm competition mechanisms vary greatly. depending on many factors including the level of sperm competition. space constraints in the sperm competition arena. male mating roles. and female influences on sperm utilisation.

However. recent research suggests that. although compensatory growth can bring quick benefits. it is also associated with a surprising variety of costs that are often not evident until much later in adult life.

The underlying mechanisms. however. have been little studied. Oxidative stress results from a mismatch between the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the organism’s capacity to mitigate their damaging effects. Managing oxidative stress is likely to be a major determinant of life histories. as virtually all activities generate ROS. There is a recent burgeoning of interest in how oxidative stress is related to different components of animal performance. The emphasis to date has been on immediate or short‐term effects. but there is an increasing realization that oxidative stress will influence life histories over longer time scales.

An implicit assumption of this hypothesis is that males that can afford to produce more elaborate carotenoid-dependent displays must be healthier individuals with superior immunocompetence.

The observed variation in telomere length among individuals of the same age is therefore thought to be related to variation in potential longevity. Studies of this relationship are hampered by the time scale over which individuals need to be followed. particularly in long-lived species where lifespan variation is greatest. So far. data are based either on simple comparisons of telomere length among different age classes or on individuals whose telomere length is measured at most twice and whose subsequent survival is monitored for only a short proportion of the typical lifespan.

1169944,The effects of habitat on the vigilance of shorebirds: is visibility important?,1984,Neil B Metcalfe,32,Animal Behaviour,4,981-985,Academic Press,Previous studies of vigilance have concentrated on situations where the prey species has an unimpaired view of its surroundings. Here the effects of reduced visibility caused by objects adjacent to the prey are studied in two species of shorebird. A reduction in visibility causes an increase in the level of vigilance. indicating an increase in vulnerability despite the greater degree of camouflaging. This increase is due to individuals being less able to see both approaching predators and their neighbours. Turnstones. Arenaria interpres. and purple sandpipers. Calidris maritima. show very similar increases in the level of vigilance with decreasing visibility. but achieve these increases by different means: turnstones lengthen the duration of each vigilant scan. while purple sandpipers scan more often. Increasing scanning rate produces a shortened interval between scans. which reduces the risk of being caught unawares by …,True,mDTBBEQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,287,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347284802109,12945323285856294336,/scholar?cites=12945323285856294336,,,0,0,0

Salmo salar. changed their foraging strategy markedly after a brief exposure to a model trout predator. in ways that reduced their conspicuousness and hence risk of being preyed upon. After seeing the predator. the salmon were less likely to orientate to passing food particles. and having orientated. were less likely to attack them. They also reduced the extent of their movements. by only attacking those food particles that came close to them. and by delaying attacks until the food had reached its closest point. They were slower to orientate to approaching food items. possibly because more visual attention was switched to scanning for predators and less to feeding. However. there was no change in the outcome of attacks. indicating that the reduced food intake was not caused by a reduction in appetite.

Juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) that do not migrate to sea within the next year spend the winter under stones in the stream bed. In a laboratory study. we show that this coincides with a loss of appetite even in the presence of excess food: an index of appetite dropped by an average of 96% between early September and late December. 2. This period of anorexia leads to the virtual cessation of growth under environmental conditions that would otherwise allow growth to occur. 3. Juvenile salmon normally exhibit a gradual loss of fat reserves during the winter. This depletion was experimentally accelerated by depriving fish of food for 3 weeks. The fish responded by increasing their appetite; appetite was negatively correlated with the estimated energy reserves of individual fish. 4.

Most animals are active by day or by night. but not both; juvenile salmonids are unusual in that they switch from being predominantly diurnal for most of the year to being nocturnal in winter. They are visual foragers. and adaptations for high visual acuity at daytime light intensities are generally incompatible with sensitive night vision. Here we test whether juvenile Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar are able to maintain their efficiency of prey capture when switching between diurnal and nocturnal foraging. 2. By testing the ability of the fish to acquire drifting food items under a range of manipulated light intensities. we show that the foraging efficiency of juvenile salmon is high at light intensities down to those equivalent to dawn or dusk. but drops markedly at lower levels of illumination: even under the best night condition (full moon and clear sky). the feeding efficiency is only 35% of their diurnal efficiency. and fish will …,True,mDTBBEQAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC,247,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2435.1997.00098.x,895815123123298955,/scholar?cites=895815123123298955,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1046/j.1365-2435.1997.00098.x,0,0,0

Parental care forms an integral part of an organism's reproduction. development. and life-history. and because caring for offspring means that parents have less time. resources. or energy available to search for or attract mates. the evolution of parental care is closely linked with sexual selection. In addition. the evolution of parental care represents an important step in the evolution of sociality as it leads to the formation of family groups. which provides a bridge to more complex forms of social structures. But because parents and offspring share only some of their genes. conflicts emerge in sexually reproducing organisms that shape the evolution of parental care and offspring strategies to demand care. As a consequence. the family also constitutes a model to understand the evolutionary tension between cooperation and conflict.

1169954,What is parental care?,2012,PT Smiseth and M. Kölliker and NJ Royle,,,,1-17,Oxford University Press,Parents of most insects provide no care for their offspring beyond supplying the eggs with a small amount of yolk and placing them in a location that is relatively safe from environmental hazards. The rare occurrence of post-oviposition parental care is thought to reflect the early evolution in insects of a complex suite of egg and oviposition traits that effectively protected the eggs from predators. pathogens. desiccation. and other environmental hazards without the need for costly post-oviposition parental care (Hinton 1981; Zeh et al. 1989). Yet. parents of some insects do provide post-oviposition care that enhances the offspring’s survival and/or growth. often at a substantial cost to the parents’ future reproductive potential. Most such insects. including the treehopper Publilia concava. provide relatively simple forms of care whereby one parent. typically the female. attends the eggs until hatching (Zink 2003). However. a few insect species exhibit elaborate forms of care similar to those characterizing birds and mammals. For example. in Nicrophorus burying beetles. male and female parents co-operate by applying antimicrobials to help preserve the vertebrate carcass that serves as a food source for the developing larvae (Rozen et al. 2008; Cotter and Kilner 2010; Arce et al. 2012). defending the brood from predators and conspecific competitors (Trumbo 2007). and provisioning the larvae with pre-digested carrion (Eggert et al. 1998; Smiseth and Moore 2002).

In the great tit (Parus major). a monogamous passerine bird. male resourceholding potential (RHP) and fertilization success both depend on male body size (e.g.. tarsus length) and plumage traits (e.g.. breast stripe size). It is predicted that the proportion of sons in a brood should increase both with male body size and plumage traits. assuming that these traits show a father—offspring correlation. This was confirmed in our study: the proportion of sons in the brood increased significantly with male tarsus length and also. though not significantly. with the size of the breast stripe.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1442,459-463,The Royal Society,Current theory proposes that nestlings beg to signal hunger level to parents honestly. or that siblings compete by escalating begging to attract the attention of parents. Although begging is assumed to be directed at parents. barn owl (Tyto alba) nestlings vocalize in the presence but also in the absence of the parents. Applying the theory of asymmetrical contests we experimentally tested three predictions of the novel hypothesis that in the absence of the parents siblings vocally settle contests over prey items to be delivered next by a parent. This ‘sibling negotiation hypothesis’ proposes that offspring use each others' begging vocalization as a source of information about their relative willingness to contest the next prey item delivered. In line with the hypothesis we found that (i) a nestling barn owl refrains from vocalization when a rival is more hungry. but (ii) escalates once the rival has been fed by a parent. and (iii …,True,NDd4ur8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,117,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2000.1022,4911485912014669981,/scholar?cites=4911485912014669981,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1690556/pdf/10737402.pdf,0,0,0

However. parental care and offspring solicitation are expected to have complex patterns of inheritance. Here we present a quantitative genetic model of parent‐offspring interactions that allows us to investigate the evolutionary maintenance of a state of resolved conflict. We show that offspring solicitation and parental provisioning are expected to become genetically correlated through coadaptation and that their genetic architecture is dictated by an interaction between patterns of selection and the proximate mechanisms regulating supply and demand.

Parental care forms an integral part of an organism's reproduction. development. and life-history. and because caring for offspring means that parents have less time. resources. or energy available to search for or attract mates. the evolution of parental care is closely linked with sexual selection. In addition. the evolution of parental care represents an important step in the evolution of sociality as it leads to the formation of family groups. which provides a bridge to more complex forms of social structures. But because parents and offspring share only some of their genes. conflicts emerge in sexually reproducing organisms that shape the evolution of parental care and offspring strategies to demand care.

1169981,Parental care,2014,Per T Smiseth and Mathias Kölliker and Nick J Royle,,"The evolution of insect mating systems. Oxford University Press, Oxford",,221-241,,Parents of most insects provide no care for their offspring beyond supplying the eggs with a small amount of yolk and placing them in a location that is relatively safe from environmental hazards. The rare occurrence of post-oviposition parental care is thought to reflect the early evolution in insects of a complex suite of egg and oviposition traits that effectively protected the eggs from predators. pathogens. desiccation. and other environmental hazards without the need for costly post-oviposition parental care (Hinton 1981; Zeh et al. 1989). Yet. parents of some insects do provide post-oviposition care that enhances the offspring’s survival and/or growth. often at a substantial cost to the parents’ future reproductive potential. Most such insects. including the treehopper Publilia concava. provide relatively simple forms of care whereby one parent. typically the female. attends the eggs until hatching (Zink 2003). However. a few insect species exhibit elaborate forms of care similar to those characterizing birds and mammals. For example. in Nicrophorus burying beetles. male and female parents co-operate by applying antimicrobials to help preserve the vertebrate carcass that serves as a food source for the developing larvae (Rozen et al. 2008; Cotter and Kilner 2010; Arce et al. 2012). defending the brood from predators and conspecific competitors (Trumbo 2007). and provisioning the larvae with pre-digested carrion (Eggert et al. 1998; Smiseth and Moore 2002).

Such species provide a unique opportunity to examine the evolution of offspring begging from nonndash;signalling offspring foraging strategies. We used the partially begging burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides to test specific hypotheses concerning the coexistence of begging and selfndash;feeding. We first tested whether the cessation of larval begging coincided with an increase in the efficiency of selfndash;feeding. As predicted. begging ceased when the efficiency of selfndash;feeding reached the point where the larvae grew just as well without as with access to food provided by the parent.

Differential response by males and females,2005,Per T Smiseth and Carolyn Dawson and Elizabeth Varley and Allen J Moore,69,Animal Behaviour,3,551-559,Academic Press,Game theory has been used to provide theoretical solutions for the evolutionary stability of biparental care given sexual conflict between parents. Existing models predict that. should one parent reduce its care. the mate should adjust its care facultatively to compensate partially. This has been tested mostly on birds with equivocal results. To examine the generality of this prediction. we tested for facultative adjustments in care in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. where both parents regurgitate predigested carrion to their offspring. Females were considerably more involved than males in direct care of the larvae before mate removal. Males adjusted their care significantly after female removal. whereas females showed no response to male removal. Thus. only male behaviour was consistent with theoretical predictions.

Such traits depend not only on the individual‘s own genotype (termed direct genetic effects). but also on the genotypes that make up the family environment (termed indi—rect genetic effects or IGEs; Moore et al. 1997; Wolf et al. 1998; Wolf et al. 1999). IGEs occur when the genotype of one individual affects the expression of genes in another individual. with the effect medi—ated by the social interaction. They thereby add to the phenotypic variation between individuals upon which selection acts. Interacting phenotypes cannot be attributed unambiguously to a genotype or individual. so the phenomenon of IGEs complicates the common perspective held in behavioural ecology that the evolution of (behavioural) phenotypes can be studied ‘as if there were a haploid locus at which each distinct strategy was represented by a distinct allele’(Grafen 1984; often referred to as the phenotypic gambit assumption). There are several reasons why IGEs may be par—ticularly important in the evolution of parental care and family interactions. First. the often highly repeated transfers of parental resources combined with offspring traits to solicit care means that indirect genetic effects should be particularly effec-tive (Cheverud and Moore 1994). Second. parental care is associated with a highly stable and structured group composition comprising one or both parents and (normally) their genetic offspring.

Restrained growth rate has functionally been explained by negative effects on lifespan of accelerated growth. However. the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Telomere attrition has been proposed as a causal agent and has been studied in endothermic vertebrates. We established that telomeres exist as chromosomal-ends in a model insect. the field cricket. using terminal restriction fragment and Bal 31 methods. Telomeres comprised TTAGGn repeats of 38kb on average. more than four times longer than the telomeres of human infants. Bal 31 assays confirmed that telomeric repeats were located at the chromosome-ends. We tested whether rapid growth is achieved at the expense of telomere length by comparing crickets reared at 23°C with their siblings reared at 28°C. which grew three times faster. Surprisingly. neither temperature treatment nor age affected average telomere length. Concomitantly. the broad sense heritability of telomere length was remarkably high at ~100%. Despite high heritability. the evolvability (a mean standardized measure of genetic variance) was low relative to that of body mass. We discuss the different interpretations of these scaling methods in the context of telomere evolution. It is clear that some important features of vertebrate telomere biology are evident in an insect species dating back to the Triassic. but also that there are some striking differences.

Males may have more opportunity to concentrate reproductive investment earlier in life. mating with as many females as possible soon after becoming adult. This fundamental difference leads to the prediction that because males can bias allocation towards increased reproductive investment early in life. they will use up resources earlier in their lives and hence senesce faster than females.

1170022,Nutritional and Social Environmental Effects on Parental Care,2014,Paul Edward Hopwood,,,,,University of Exeter,Parental care is likely to evolve when benefits of care are greater than costs. Provision of parental care may buffer vulnerable offspring against unpredictable or hazardous environments permitting parents to breed in situations too hostile for unassisted juvenile survival. The nature of environmental unpredictability faced by parents and their offspring (e.g.. availability of nutritional resources. breeding resources and/or the strength of competition) provides the ecological context in which costs and benefits of parental traits are defined. Therefore investigations about how the environment might shape parental traits ought not only to be conducted in the laboratory but also in a natural setting where unanticipated parameters may have profound effects on theoretical predictions. I conducted a series of manipulative experiments and observational studies in the laboratory and in the field using burying beetles. Nicrophorus vespilloides. to examine the effects of environmental variation on parental competitive ability. reproductive productivity. longevity and the expression of parental sex-role differences and alternative reproductive tactics. In these beetles a relative size advantage confers success in contests for scarce and vital breeding resources so a central prediction was that reproductive success would be positively correlated with body size. In contrast I found that reproductive performance was favoured over contest success when nutritional resources were delayed temporarily during a developmental window. Larger beetles do win contests for breeding-resources but the benefits of being large depend on the quality of the social environment experienced …,True,X0-RQgsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/15476,,,,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/15476/HopwoodP.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

So far. data are based either on simple comparisons of telomere length among different age classes or on individuals whose telomere length is measured at most twice and whose subsequent survival is monitored for only a short proportion of the typical lifespan.

One plausible mechanism is oxidative damage to proteins. lipids. and nucleic acids caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Some recent studies have shown that the brightness of aposematic displays correlates positively with the strength of toxicity. suggesting that aposematic displays are a form of handicap signal. the conspicuousness of which reliably indicates the level of toxicity. The theoretical consensus in the literature is. however. at odds with this finding. It is commonly assumed that the most toxic prey should have less bright advertisements because they have better chances of surviving attacks and can therefore reduce the costs incurred by signalling. Using a novel theoretical model. we show that aposematic signals can indeed function as handicaps. To generate this prediction. we make a key assumption that the expression of bright displays and the storage of anti-predator toxins compete for resources within prey individuals.

In particular. the relative importance of pigment acquisition and utilization (i.e. physiological discrimination: differential uptake. transport. deposition or metabolic conversions) is poorly understood. 2. Carotenoids are antioxidants. capable of neutralizing reactive free radicals and thus preventing lipid peroxidation. But animals must ultimately obtain carotenoids in the diet. and metabolic conversion of carotenoids is inefficient and expends energy. It has therefore been suggested that carotenoid supply may be limiting to animals. 3. Prelaying. wild Lesser Black‐Backed Gulls (Larus fuscus L.) were given supplementary feed with a cocktail of four carotenoids. or a carotenoid‐free (control) supplement.

1170060,The evolution of individual and cultural variation in social learning,2016,Alex Mesoudi and Lei Chang and Sasha RX Dall and Alex Thornton,31,,3,215-225,Elsevier Current Trends,It is often assumed in experiments and models that social learning abilities – how often individuals copy others. plus who and how they copy – are species-typical. Yet there is accruing evidence for systematic individual variation in social learning within species. Here we review evidence for this individual variation. placing it within a continuum of increasing phenotypic plasticity. from genetically polymorphic personality traits. to developmental plasticity via cues such as maternal stress. to the individual learning of social learning. and finally the social learning of social learning. The latter. possibly restricted to humans. can generate stable between-group cultural variation in social learning.

1170061,Food insecurity as a driver of obesity in humans: The insurance hypothesis,2017,Daniel Nettle and Clare Andrews and Melissa Bateson,40,Behavioral and Brain Sciences,,,Cambridge University Press,Integrative explanations of why obesity is more prevalent in some sectors of the human population than others are lacking. Here. we outline and evaluate one candidate explanation. the insurance hypothesis (IH). The IH is rooted in adaptive evolutionary thinking: The function of storing fat is to provide a buffer against shortfall in the food supply. Thus. individuals should store more fat when they receive cues that access to food is uncertain. Applied to humans. this implies that an important proximate driver of obesity should be food insecurity rather than food abundance per se. We integrate several distinct lines of theory and evidence that bear on this hypothesis. We present a theoretical model that shows it is optimal to store more fat when food access is uncertain. and we review the experimental literature from non-human animals showing that fat reserves increase when access to food is restricted.

Ltd.,The determinants and consequences of niche width have long been a focus of interest for ecologists and evolutionary biologists. From a macroevolutionary perspective. specialisation of feeding habits and habitat is thought to increase the rate of species turnover by increasing the rate of both speciation and extinction (eg Stanley 1974. 1979. Eldredge 1989). Given that speciation events are thought to be necessary to conserve adaptive change by genetically isolating locally adapted demes (Eldredge 1989). niche width therefore has important consequences for significant evolutionary change. The implications for community ecology revolve around niche overlap and competition within a trophic level (see Leigh 1990 for a review). and density dependent population dynamics between levels (eg Fryxell and Lundberg 1994).

Series B: Biological Sciences,1427,1519-1526,The Royal Society,In an uncertain world. animals face both unexpected opportunities and danger. Such outcomes can select for two potential strategies: collecting information to reduce uncertainty. or insuring against it. We investigate the relative value of information and insurance (energy reserves) under starvation risk by offering model foragers a choice between constant and varying food sources over finite foraging bouts. We show that sampling the variable option (choosing it when it is not expected to be good) should decline both with lower reserves and late in foraging bouts; in order to be able to reap the reduction in uncertainty associated with exploiting a variable resource effectively. foragers must be able to afford and compensate for an initial increase in the risk of an energetic shortfall associated with choosing the option when it is bad.

The ready availability of information from conspecifics allows animals to make better decisions about avoiding predators. reducing brood parasitism. migratory phenology. mate choice. habitat choice and foraging.

Automated proximity loggers are increasingly being used to record interactions between animals. but the accuracy and reliability of the collected data remain largely un-assessed. Here we use laboratory and observational field data to assess the performance of these devices fitted to a herd of 32 beef cattle (Bos taurus) and nine groups of badgers (Meles meles. n = 77) living in the surrounding woods. The distances at which loggers detected each other were found to decrease over time. potentially related to diminishing battery power that may be a function of temperature. Loggers were highly accurate in recording the identification of contacted conspecifics. but less reliable at determining contact duration. There was a tendency for extended interactions to be recorded as a series of shorter contacts. We show how data can be manipulated to correct this discrepancy and accurately reflect observed interaction patterns by combining records between any two loggers that occur within a 1 to 2 minute amalgamation window. and then removing any remaining 1 second records.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Individuals are often consistent in their behavior but vary from each other in the level of behavior shown. Despite burgeoning interest in such animal personality variation. studies on invertebrates are scarce. and studies on clonal invertebrates nonexistent. This is surprising given the obvious advantages of using invertebrates/clones to tackle the crucial question why such consistent behavioral differences exist. Here we show that individuals of clonal pea aphids exhibit consistent behavioral differences in their escape responses to a predator attack (dropping vs. nondropping off a plant). However. behavior was not repeatable at the clonal level. Genetically identical clones expressed various phenotypes but different clones produced different proportions of each phenotype (dropper. nondropper. and inconsistent).

In order to elucidate which mechanisms are important for the evolution of personality differences. it is crucial to understand which aspects of the environment are important for the development of personality differences. Here. we tested whether physical or social aspects of the environment during development influence individual differentiation (mean level of behavior) using the jumping spider Marpissa muscosa.

We applied a split-brood design and raised spider siblings in three different environments: a deprived environment with no enrichment. a socially and a physically enriched environment.

We manipulated the reproductive success (enlarged. reduced. and control broods) in a nest-box population of migratory pied flycatchers. Ficedula hypoleuca. in Finland. We measured the visitation rates of prospectors at 87 nest-boxes continuously from manipulation (day 3 after hatching) to fledging. 302 adult pied flycatchers prospected 9194 times on these manipulated nests (at least 78% of detected prospectors were successful breeders).

Social ties are important for group coordination at collective tasks. and social coordination can facilitate synchronized reproduction among colony members. Synchronized reproduction in turn can amplify the benefits of coloniality. such as social foraging and predator avoidance. We conducted a field study to investigate whether synchronized reproduction among individuals in replicated colonies is linked to the strength of their social bond. and whether these strong bonds are maintained beyond the reproductive period. We PIT‐tagged wild zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). monitoring their reproduction and social foraging over two consecutive years.

However. available data are largely restricted to wild vertebrates and eusocial insects. In addition. there is the expectation that most insects tend to have such large‐ and high‐density populations and are so mobile that they are unlikely to face inbreeding risks through fine‐scale population structuring. This has made the growing body of evidence for inbreeding avoidance in insects and its implication in mating systems evolution somewhat enigmatic. We present a 4‐year study of a natural population of field crickets. Using detailed video monitoring combined with genotyping. we track the movement of all adults within the population and investigate genetic structure at a fine scale.

Xiphophorus helleri,2008,Craig A Walling and Nick J Royle and Jan Lindström and Neil B Metcalfe,76,Animal Behaviour,2,271-276,Academic Press,Most studies of female mating preferences have found preferences for males with greater trait expression. This has led to the suggestion that most female preferences are in the direction of greater sensory stimulation and may be the result of pre-existing sensory biases. Recently. studies have revealed that mating preferences can be lost or reversed. even in species where a pre-existing sensory bias appears to be the basis of female preferences. These studies concentrate on changes in female preferences on evolutionary timescales. and there is little evidence of whether female mating preferences based on pre-existing sensory biases can be altered by individual experience. Using green swordtail fish. we investigated whether female preferences for less ornamented males can be induced by manipulating early social experience.

A final cooperative treatment entailed pairing subjects with a second individual from the same population. but of the alternative size class. during predator presentation.

If females are the limiting sex. as few as one mate can be optimal. Despite the theoretical differences driving multiple mating in the sexes. multiple mating is the norm rather than the exception. Empirical investigations are therefore required to determine why females mate with multiple males. Both nonadaptive (correlated responses to selection on males. given the mean mating rates have to be the same) and adaptive (direct or indirect fitness benefits) can drive the evolution of multiple mating in females. Females of the burying beetle Nicorphorus vespilloides often mate repeatedly with the same male. but this appears to be a correlated response to selection on males rather than reflecting direct benefits to females for multiple mating.

However. while classical models assume environmental constancy. most natural populations exist in variable environments. Here. we applied a novel analytical technique to a long-term study of birthweight in wild sheep and examined. for the first time. how variation in environmental quality simultaneously influences the strength of natural selection and the genetic basis of trait variability. In addition to demonstrating that selection and genetic variance vary dramatically across environments. our results show that environmental heterogeneity induces a negative correlation between these two parameters. Harsh environmental conditions were associated with strong selection for increased birthweight but low genetic variance. and vice versa. Consequently. the potential for microevolution in this population is constrained by either a lack of heritable variation (in poor environments) or by a reduced strength of selection (in good environments). More generally. environmental dependence of this nature may act to limit rates of evolution. maintain genetic variance. and favour phenotypic stasis in many natural systems.

Phenotypic convergence among adult sheep occurs through decreasing environmental and maternal genetic variation. Maternal variation similarly declines in cattle.

In Soay sheep. dark coat color is associated with large size. which is heritable and positively correlated with fitness. yet the frequency of dark sheep has decreased. This unexpected microevolutionary trend is explained by genetic linkage between the causal mutation underlying the color polymorphism and quantitative trait loci with antagonistic effects on size and fitness.

In the presence of a single intermediate optimum phenotype (fitness peak) on the fitness surface. stabilizing selection should cause the population to evolve toward such a peak. This prediction has seldom been tested. particularly for suites of correlated traits. The lack of tests for an evolutionary match between population means and adaptive peaks may be due. at least in part. to problems associated with empirically detecting multivariate stabilizing selection and with testing whether population means are at the peak of multivariate fitness surfaces. Here we show how canonical analysis of the fitness surface. combined with the estimation of confidence regions for stationary points on quadratic response surfaces. may be used to define multivariate stabilizing selection on a suite of traits and to establish whether natural populations reside on the …,True,BZ33lgUAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,220,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb01760.x,16490449319036077054,/scholar?cites=16490449319036077054,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb01760.x,0,0,0

Series B: Biological Sciences,1415,145-150,The Royal Society,Reproductive strategies often consist of two alternative tactics whereby males either compete for and guard females. or sneak copulations. By their nature. alternative tactics expose males to differing risks of sperm competition; sneaks will always be subject to sperm competition but guards will be subject to sperm competition with low probability. dependent on the number of sneaks. Recent game–theoretical models predict that males in the sneak role should have the greater gametic expenditure but that the disparity in expenditure should decrease with increasing numbers of sneaks. Male dung beetles in the genus Onthophagus can be separated into two morphs: major males have horns and guard females whereas minor males are hornless and sneak copulations. Here we compare testis size and ejaculate characteristics between these alternative morphs.

The patterns of fluctuating asymmetry in beetle horns have been proposed to support the honest signalling hypothesis. Here we examine three assumptions of the hypothesis. (1) that traits are costly to produce; (2) the levels of fluctuating asymmetry are indicative of stress imposed during development; and (3) that males with larger traits should have more symmetrical traits. using the horned beetle.

One mechanism by which parents are able to influence offspring phenotype is through the level of care they provide. In onthophagine dung beetles. parents typically provision their offspring by packing dung fragments into a brood mass. Onthophagus taurus males can be separated into two discrete morphs: Large. “major” males have head horns. whereas “minor” males are hornless. Here we show that a switch in parental provisioning strategies adopted by males coincides with the switch in male morphology. Male provisioning results in the production of heavier brood masses than females will produce alone.

However. a growing number of studies that control for male-male competition have shown no correlation between dominance and attractiveness. Aggressive males can interfere with female mate preference either by physically coercing females into mating or by driving submissive males away and restricting mate choice. The most common method of assessing female mate choice is by using simultaneous two-choice tests. These control for male-male interactions. but usually interfere with physical and chemical cues involved in mate selection or alter male behaviour. They are therefore unsuitable for many study species. especially insects. Another method is the no-choice test that measures a female’s latency to mating when placed with a single male as an indication of male attractiveness.

Recent theory predicts that indirect benefits of female choice due to offspring inheriting superior genes are likely to be negated when there are direct costs associated with choice. including any costs of mating with attractive males. To estimate the fitness consequences of mating with males of varying attractiveness. we housed female house crickets. Acheta domesticus. with either attractive or unattractive males and measured a variety of direct and indirect fitness components. These fitness components were combined to give relative estimates of the number of grandchildren produced and the intrinsic rate of increase (relative net fitness). We found that females mated to attractive males incur a substantial survival cost. However. these costs are cancelled out and may be outweighed by the benefits of having offspring with elevated fitness. This benefit is due predominantly. but not exclusively. to the effect of an increase in sons' attractiveness. Our results suggest that the direct costs that females experience when mating with attractive males can be outweighed by indirect benefits.

We restricted female predatory ground beetles (Anchomenus dorsalis) to one of a range of diets varying in lipid and protein content. and showed that total egg production peaked at a target intake of both nutrients. Other beetles given a choice to feed from two diets differing only in protein and lipid composition selectively ingested nutrient combinations at this target intake.

This generates intralocus sexual conflict that may constrain trait evolution by preventing the sexes from reaching their optimal phenotype.

Estimation of the degree of genetic variance in parental care is important because it can be a significant source of maternal effects. which. if genetically based. represent indirect genetic effects. A major prediction of indirect genetic effect theory is that traits without heritable variation can evolve because of the heritable environmental variation that indirect genetic effects provide. In the dung beetle. Onthophagus taurus. females provide care to offspring by provisioning a brood mass. The size of the brood mass has pronounced effects on offspring phenotype.

However. even when female discrimination is relatively easy to observe. as in numerous insect species with externally attached spermatophores. it is often difficult to demonstrate directional CFC for certain male phenotypes over others. Using a biological assay to separate male crickets into attractive or unattractive categories. we demonstrate that females strongly discriminate against unattractive males by removing their spermatophores before insemination can be completed. This results in significantly more sperm being transferred by attractive males than unattractive males.

This is partly because strong directional choice should theoretically deplete the genetic variation that explains the evolution of this type of female mating preference (the so-called lek paradox). Moreover. good-genes benefits are generally assumed to be too small to outweigh opposing direct selection on females. Here. we review recent progress in the study of mate choice for genetic quality. focussing particularly on the potential for genotype by environment interactions (GEIs) to rescue additive genetic variation for quality. and thereby resolve the lek paradox.

Plasticity can increase or decrease variation. but most previous studies have been limited to single populations. single traits and a small number of environments assessed using univariate reaction norms. Here. examining two genetically distinct populations of Daphnia pulex with different predation histories. we quantified predator-induced plasticity among 11 traits along a fine-scale gradient of predation risk by a predator (Chaoborus) common to both populations.

Recent theory proposes that the major axis of genetic variation in a phenotypically plastic population can align with the direction of selection. Therefore. theory predicts that plasticity directly aids adaptation by increasing genetic variation in the direction favoured by selection and reflected in plasticity. We evaluated this theory in the freshwater crustacean Daphnia pulex. facing predation risk from two contrasting size-selective predators. We estimated plasticity in several life-history traits. the G matrix of these traits. the selection gradients on reproduction and survival. and the predicted responses to selection. Using these data. we tested whether the genetic lines of least resistance and the predicted response to selection aligned with plasticity.

Life-history theory predicts that as individuals age and their residual reproductive value decreases. they should increase investment in contest behavior. However. other factors such as social experience may also be important in determining age-related variation in contest behavior. To understand how selection acts on contest behavior over an individual’s lifetime. it is therefore important to tease apart the effects of age per se from other factors that may vary with age. Here. we independently manipulate male age and social experience to examine their effects on male contest behavior in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides.

The thermal-stress hypothesis posits that a lower mass-independent BMR reduces overheating in burrows where convective and evaporative heat loss is low. whereas the cost-of-burrowing hypothesis states that a lower mass-independent BMR may compensate for the extremely high energy expenditure of digging during foraging activity.

Carter and Rodrigo Ramos-Jiliberto,84,Revista Chilena de Historia Natural,,195-201,,In ecological communities. pollution driven perturbations exert immediate effects on sensitive individuals. but these effects may be transmitted among interacting organisms and spread over the community through several paths. This makes the assessment and prediction of ecological consequences of pollution difficult. The propagation of perturbation effects among organisms can be horizontal among organisms that coexist in space and time. and vertical among organism that belong to different generations. The latter process is poorly understood. in particular in planktonic organisms facing metal pollution. In this study we evaluate the vertical transfer of effects driven by sublethal copper stress on the heartbeat rate. somatic growth and fertility of Daphnia pulex. In order to evaluate this. we performed a factorial experiment in which parental and filial generations were exposed to both copperenriched and control media. We found that parental exposure to copper exerted a significant effect on the heartbeat rate. somatic growth and fertility of offspring. revealing a transgenerational effect in D. pulex. This response may be explained by a higher resource investment on repair/detoxification processes in the parental generation. allocating fewer resources to offspring quality.

In the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. repeated mating provides assurance of paternity at a direct cost to female reproductive productivity. To reduce this cost. females could choose males with low repeated mating rates or smaller. servile males. We tested this by offering females a dichotomous choice between males from lines selected for high or low mating rate. Each female was then allocated her preferred or non-preferred male to breed. Females showed no preference for males based on whether they came from lines selected for high or low mating rates. Pairs containing males from high mating rate lines copulated more often than those with low line males but there was a negative relationship between female size and number of times she mated with a non-preferred male.

1170199,Geographical origin determines responses to salinity of Mediterranean caddisflies,2020,Mauricio J Carter and Matías Flores and Rodrigo Ramos-Jiliberto,15,PloS one,1,e0220275,Public Library of Science,Many freshwater ecosystems worldwide. and particularly Mediterranean ones. show increasing levels of salinity. These changes in water conditions could affect abundance and distribution of inhabiting species as well as the provision of ecosystem services. In this study we conduct laboratory experiments using the macroinvertebrate Smicridea annulicornis as a model organism. Our factorial experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of geographical origin of organisms and salinity levels on survival and behavioral responses of caddisflies. The experimental organisms were captured from rivers belonging to three hydrological basins along a 450 Km latitudinal gradient in the Mediterranean region of Chile. Animals were exposed to three conductivity levels. from 180 to 1400 μS/cm. close to the historical averages of the source rivers. We measured the behavioral responses to experimental stimuli and the survival time. Our results showed that geographical origin shaped the behavioral and survival responses to salinity. In particular. survival and activity decreased more strongly with increasing salinity in organisms coming from more dilute waters. This suggests local adaptation to be determinant for salinity responses in this benthic invertebrate species. In the current scenario of fast temporal and spatial changes in water levels and salt concentration. the conservation of geographic intra-specific variation of aquatic species is crucial for lowering the risk of salinity-driven biodiversity loss.,True,l7KksIMAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220275,,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220275,0,0,0

Two of these are the thermal-stress and the cost-of-burrowing hypotheses. The thermal-stress hypothesis posits that a lower mass-independent BMR reduces overheating in burrows where convective and evaporative heat loss is low. whereas the cost-of-burrowing hypothesis states that a lower mass-independent BMR may compensate for the extremely high energy expenditure of digging during foraging activity. In this paper we tested both hypotheses at an intraspecific level. We compared seven populations of the subterranean rodent Spalacopus cyanus or cururo from different geographic localities with contrasting habitat conditions. We measured BMR and digging metabolic rate (DMR) through open flow respirometry. Our results support neither the thermal-stress nor the cost-of-burrowing hypothesis. Cururos from habitats with contrasting climatic and soil conditions exhibited similar BMR and DMR when measured under similar semi-natural conditions. It is possible that S. cyanus originated in Andean locations where it adapted to relatively hard soils. Later. when populations moved into coastal areas characterized by softer soils. they may have retained the original adaptation without further phenotypic changes. D 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Our understanding of polyandry is also restricted by the relative paucity of studies that disentangle the fitness effects of mating more than once with a single male and mating with multiple males. Here we investigated potential benefits and costs of polyandry in the horned beetle. Gnatocerus cornutus. while controlling for the number of matings. We found that female life span was independent of mating frequency. indicating that mating itself is not very costly. However. females that mated more than once laid more eggs and had greater lifetime reproductive success than singly mated females.

Weak natural selection late in life allows the accumulation of deleterious mutations and may favor alleles that have positive effects on fitness early in life. but costly pleiotropic effects expressed later on. While this decline in natural selection is central to longstanding evolutionary explanations for aging. a role for sexual selection and sexual conflict in the evolution of lifespan and aging has only been identified recently.

More generally. oxidative damage could be a cost of reproduction that reduces survival. Both of these hypotheses have mixed empirical support. To better understand the life-history consequences of oxidative damage. we fed male and female Australian field crickets (Teleogryllus commodus) four diets differing in their protein and carbohydrate content. which have sex-specific effects on reproductive effort and lifespan. We supplemented half of these crickets with the vitamin E isoform DL-alpha-tocopherol and measured the effects of nutrient intake on lifespan. reproduction. oxidative damage and antioxidant protection. We found a clear trade-off between reproductive effort and lifespan in females but not in males. In direct contrast to the oxidative stress theory. crickets fed diets that improved their lifespan had high levels of oxidative damage to proteins. Supplementation with DL-alpha-tocopherol did not significantly improve lifespan or reproductive effort. However. males fed diets that increased their reproductive investment experienced high oxidative damage to proteins. While this suggests that male reproductive effort could elevate oxidative damage. this was not associated with reduced male survival.

Thus. to quantify which species and places on Earth are most vulnerable to climate-driven extinction. a global understanding of how demographic rates respond to climate is needed3. We synthesise information on such responses in terrestrial mammals. where extensive demographic data are available4. Given the importance of assessing the full spectrum of responses. we focus on studies that quantitatively link climate to multiple demographic rates. We identify 106 such studies. corresponding to 86 mammal species. We reveal a strong mismatch between the locations of demographic studies and the regions and taxa currently recognised as most vulnerable to climate change5.6. Moreover. we show that the effects of climate change on mammals will operate via complex demographic mechanisms: a vast majority of mammal populations display projected increases in some demographic rates but declines in others.

For this. we consider the evolution and maintenance of both main aspects of animal personality: inter‐individual variation and intra‐individual consistency.,True,wyvi2EcAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,401,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2009.00101.x,9270406920210364377,/scholar?cites=9270406920210364377,,https://www.academia.edu/download/6019632/wsetal_br10.pdf,0,0,0
1170235,Building on the ideal free distribution,1995,Tom Tregenza,26,,,253-307,Academic Press,This chapter reviews how the question of animal distributions has been approached from the point of view of individual behavior. The basis for much of the work on this subject has been the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) theory. which considers that the suitability of any area of the environment is a function of the density of competitors occurring there. The chapter reviews how ideal free theory has been developed and examines whether the predictions of IFD models are supported by experimental and field studies. Furthermore. the assumptions of equal competitive ability. omniscience. movement without costs and a single type of competition have all be shown to be inappropriate in many situations. When unequal competitors are considered. a range of new distributions are predicted including phenotypes being truncated across patches of different quality.

A number of genetic benefits have been proposed. based on the idea that by taking multiple mates. females increase the likelihood that their offspring will be sired by genetically more compatible or superior males. If certain males have intrinsically “good genes.” any female mating with them will produce superior offspring. Alternatively. if some males have genetic elements that are incompatible with a particular female. then she may benefit from polyandry if the sperm of such males are less likely to fertilize her eggs. We examined these hypotheses in the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae).

Although most interest has focused on auditory communication. increasing circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a widespread additional communication channel in the form of cuticular contact pheromones. Using the field cricket.Gryllus bimaculatuswe conducted a behavioural assay which demonstrated that males can distinguish the sex of conspecifics using such a channel.

However. studies have tended to be polarized among the types of organisms studied. with vertebrates studied in the field and invertebrates in the lab. We used video monitoring combined with DNA profiling of all of the members of a wild population of field crickets across two generations to capture the factors predicting the reproductive success of males and females. The factors that predict a male’s success in gaining mates differ from those that predict how many offspring he has.

This suggests that intergenomic epistasis between mitochondrial and nuclear genes may affect whole‐organism metabolic phenotypes. Here. we use crossed combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear lineages of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus and assay metabolic rate under two different temperature regimes.

1170241,The evolution of body size under environmental gradients in ectotherms: why should Bergmann's rule apply to lizards?,2008,Daniel Pincheira-Donoso and David J Hodgson and Tom Tregenza,8,,1,1-13,BioMed Central,The impact of environmental gradients on the evolution of life history traits is a central issue in macroecology and evolutionary biology. A number of hypotheses have been formulated to explain factors shaping patterns of variation in animal mass. One such example is Bergmann's rule. which predicts that body size will be positively correlated with latitude and elevation. and hence. with decreasing environmental temperatures. A generally accepted explanation for this phenotypic response is that as body mass increases. body surface area gets proportionally smaller. which contributes to reduced rates of heat-loss. Phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic evidence reveals that endotherms follow Bergmann's rule. In contrast. while previous non-phylogenetic studies supported this prediction in up to 75% of ectotherms. recent phylogenetic comparative analyses suggest that its validity for these organisms is controversial and less understood. Moreover. little attention has been paid to why some ectotherms conform to this rule. while others do not. Here. we investigate Bergmann's rule in the six main clades forming the Liolaemus genus. one of the largest and most environmentally diverse genera of terrestrial vertebrates. A recent study conducted on some species belonging to four of these six clades concluded that Liolaemus species follow Bergmann's rule. representing the only known phylogenetic support for this model in lizards. However. a later reassessment of this evidence. performed on one of the four analysed clades. produced contrasting conclusions. Our results fail to support Bergmann's rule in Liolaemus lizards.

In the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. females will mate with almost any male presented to them. despite receiving no recorded direct benefits. Previous studies have shown that female crickets can benefit from polyandry through increased hatching success of their eggs. There is evidence that this effect is driven by the potential of polyandrous females to avoid fertilizing eggs with sperm from genetically incompatible males. We provide direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that polyandry is a mechanism to avoid genetic incompatibilities resulting from inbreeding.

Strong indirect evidence supporting this assumption comes from the numerous studies that have identified heritable traits associated with mating success.

We present the results of an experimental study of the mating success and phenotype of male field crickets Gryllus bimaculatus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) and their offspring.

We observed nine individuals of this species displaying a repertoire of postures and body patterns. several of which are clearly impersonations of venomous animals co-occurring in this habitat. This ‘dynamic mimicry’ avoids the genetic constraints that may limit the diversity of genetically polymorphic mimics but has the same effect of decreasing the frequency with which predators encounter particular mimics.

Here. we attempt to look beyond an exclusive focus on matings to examine the fundamental conflicts that arise out of the fact that sexual reproduction involves investment in offspring by typically unrelated individuals. Conflicts between mates stem from the ever present potential for individuals to reduce their investment relative to that of their sexual partner in order to seek alternative reproductive opportunities elsewhere. All aspects of life histories. the partitioning of time and energy into growth. survival and reproduction. are inextricably caught up in. and moulded by these conflicts of interest. the most profound expression of which is the differentiation between male and female types.

Females kick their mates during copulation. If females are prevented from kicking the males. copulations last longer and the injuries females sustain are more severe. We tested whether or not these injuries represent real fitness costs that can be mitigated by kicking and also what males gain by inflicting them. Our results show that females do indeed suffer lowered lifetime fecundity if they are prevented from kicking. However. we could find no evidence that males gain benefits through harming their mates. It has been suggested that the way females respond to the harm may benefit the male causing it.

This loss of fitness has been predicted to elevate extinction risk giving it substantial conservation significance. Inbreeding may result in reduced fitness for two reasons: an increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles (partial dominance hypothesis) or the loss of favourable heterozygote combinations (overdominance hypothesis). Because both these sources of inbreeding depression are dependent upon dominance variance. inbreeding depression is predicted to be greater in life history traits than in morphological traits.

Here we shift attention to the role of sexual conflict in a monogamous mating context. Conflicts can arise. for example. when males are successful in imposing monandry at a cost to female fitness. or when females impose monogyny on males. Conflict over remating can also generate monogamy. For example. when males invest heavily in attempting to impose female monandry. the cost of their investment may prevent them from securing additional mates.

This is because. unlike males. in many cases multiple mating by females does not increase fecundity and inevitably involves some costs. As a result. a large number of indirect benefit models have been proposed to explain polyandry. One of these. the good sperm hypothesis. posits that high–quality males are better sperm competitors and sire higher–quality offspring. Hence. by mating multiply. females produce offspring of superior quality. Despite being potentially widely applicable across species. this idea has received little attention.

Hence. the suggestion has been made that exercise produces energetic benefits in other components of the daily energy budget. thus generating a net effect on energy balance much greater than the direct energy cost of the exercise alone. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the largest component of the daily energy budget in most human societies and. therefore. any increases in RMR in response to exercise interventions are potentially of great importance. Animal studies have generally shown that single exercise events and longer-term training produce increases in RMR.

Insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling (IIS) is an evolutionarily conserved (public) regulator of longevity; yet it remains unclear whether the genes and biochemical processes through which IIS acts on aging are public or private (that is. lineage specific). To address this. we have applied a novel. multi-level cross-species comparative analysis to compare gene expression changes accompanying increased longevity in mutant nematodes. fruitflies and mice with reduced IIS. Surprisingly. there is little evolutionary conservation at the level of individual. orthologous genes or paralogous genes under IIS regulation. However. a number of gene categories are significantly enriched for genes whose expression changes in long-lived animals of all three species. Down-regulated categories include protein biosynthesis-associated genes. Up-regulated categories include sugar catabolism. energy generation. glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and several other categories linked to cellular detoxification (that is. phase 1 and phase 2 metabolism of xenobiotic and endobiotic toxins). Protein biosynthesis and GST activity have recently been linked to aging and longevity assurance. respectively.

The link between aging and energetics,2002,John R Speakman and Colin Selman and Jane S McLaren and E Jean Harper,132,,6,1583S-1597S,Oxford University Press,The idea that aging should be linked to energy expenditure has a long history that can be traced to the late 1800s and the industrial revolution. Machines that are run fast wear out more quickly. so the notion was born that humans and animals might experience similar fates: the faster they live (expressed as greater energy expenditure). the sooner they die. Evidence supporting the “rate-of-living” theory was gleaned from the scaling of resting metabolism and life span as functions of body mass. The product of these factors yields a mass-invariant term. equivalent to the “amount of living.” There are at least four problems with this evidence. which are summarized and reviewed in this communication: 1) life span is a poor measure of aging. 2) resting metabolism is a poor measure of energy expenditure. 3) the effects are confounded by body mass and 4) the comparisons made are not phylogenetically independent …,True,AOWqOBwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,221,https://academic.oup.com/jn/article-abstract/132/6/1583S/4687881,10948849448068197987,/scholar?cites=10948849448068197987,,https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/132/6/1583S/4687881,0,0,0

However. oxygen consumption alone is unlikely to be a sufficient marker of energy metabolism in many situations. This is due to the inherent variability in the link between oxidation and phosphorylation; that is. the amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generated per molecule of oxygen consumed by mitochondria (P/O ratio). In this article. we describe how the P/O ratio can vary within and among individuals. and in response to a number of environmental parameters. including diet and temperature. As the P/O ratio affects the efficiency of cellular energy production. its variability may have significant consequences for animal performance. such as growth rate and reproductive output.

Offspring can respond by reducing brood size. but if they do so. parents are free to readjust their level of effort.

Why do beetles and mice commit infanticide? Why are twins and birth defects more common in older human mothers? A Natural History of Families concisely examines what behavioral ecologists have discovered about family dynamics and what these insights might tell us about human biology and behavior. Scott Forbes's engaging account describes an uneasy union among family members in which rivalry for resources often has dramatic and even fatal consequences. In nature. parents invest resources and control the allocation of resources among their offspring to perpetuate their genetic lineage. Those families sometimes function as cooperative units. the nepotistic and loving havens we choose to identify with. In the natural world. however. dysfunctional familial behavior is disarmingly commonplace. While explaining why infanticide. fratricide. and other seemingly antisocial behaviors are necessary. Forbes also uncovers several surprising applications to humans. Here the conflict begins in the moments following conception as embryos struggle to wrest control of pregnancy from the mother. and to wring more nourishment from her than she can spare. thus triggering morning sickness. diabetes. and high blood pressure. Mothers. in return. often spontaneously abort embryos with severe genetic defects. allowing for prenatal quality control of offspring.

We have come to think of conflict among avian nestlings as natural and to some extent inevitable. which is a long way from the traditional view of families as harmonious social units.

The Cain-and-Abel ba les of Black Eagles (Aquila verreauxi) and other large predatory birds. which had been described as “an inexplicable example of apparent biological waste”(Brown et al. 1977). became potentially explicable as extreme forms of sibling competition in cases where close relatives were also close rivals for limited food and tight space.

1170294,Parental optimism and progeny choice: when is screening for offspring quality affordable,1998,L Scott Forbes and Douglas W Mock,192,Journal of Theoretical Biology,1,3-14,Academic Press,Three general classes of fitness incentives have been proposed for parental overproduction of offspring: (1) tracking environmental variation; (2) developmental facilitation; and (3) replacements for failed or defective members of the core brood. In one version of this last category. called the progeny choice hypothesis. parents are seen as creating an enlarged array of offspring from which a genetically superior subset is chosen for full investment. In the selection process. parents may eliminate the victims either through personal effort (filial infanticide) or by proxy (by allowing or even encouraging fatal sibling rivalry). Because the culling process is non-random. it can elevate average offspring quality.

This phenotypic handicap exacts a cost of reduced growth and elevated mortality from the last‐hatched or “marginal” offspring. while conferring advantages to the more senior “core” brood. David Lack long ago proposed that marginal offspring allow parents to track resources that are uncertain at the time of clutch initiation. If food is insufficient for the entire brood. hatching asynchrony allows surplus marginal offspring to be culled from the brood efficiently. This in effect represents a secondary adjustment of clutch size. Today Lack's hypothesis remains a central. although controversial. component. of discussions of hatching asynchrony and avian brood reduction.

Playback experiments have shown that vocalizations serve function 1. Do they also function to influence intrabrood allocation. as contemporary begging theory suggests. or is that governed chiefly by the nonvocal components of begging (neck stretching. gaping. jockeying for position within the nest)?

Hatching asynchrony is the primary handicap; differences in egg size and hormonal manipulations play secondary roles. unless offspring hatch synchronously.

Feeding among brood members was hierarchical; senior. dominant sibs ate more when hungry. leaving a smaller residual share of food for junior sibs. Senior sibs did not become more generous at large meals (i.e.. the prospect of a large meal did not quell the selfish tendencies of senior sibs).

The authors failed to reject the null hypoth-esis of no difference between the two curves. and on this basis they concluded that sex ratio and jackrabbit density were highly correlated. Herein lies an error. albeit a subtle one. in statistical inference. Failure to reject the null hypothesis (H0) may result from one of two causes. The null hypothesis may indeed be true. or the null hypothesis may be false. but we lack sufficient statistical power to detect a real difference. This is a Type II error. Statistical power is distinct from a (the probability of rejecting Ho when H0 is true. which we set routinely at 0.05 or. more conservatively. at 0.01).• is the probability of making a Type II error. and power is 1-•.

Power analysis is a valuable but greatly underused statistical tool. It can be used a priori to design experimental or sampling regimes that minimize the probability of a Type II error.

Because self-referent chemosensory cues provide females with a simple. but reliable mechanism of identifying individuals with whom they have mated without requiring any special cognitive ability. they may …,True,zT9_ACkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,109,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2005.3222,8005047956868580110,/scholar?cites=8005047956868580110,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1599777/,0,0,0

Using complete multi-generational demographic records. we show that women with a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan have more grandchildren. and hence greater fitness. in pre-modern populations of both Finns and Canadians. This fitness benefit arises because post-reproductive mothers enhance the lifetime reproductive success of their offspring by allowing them to breed earlier. more frequently and more successfully.

Attention is currently focused on whether females choose males on the basis of their genetic quality. in order to produce more viable offspring 1.

While early explanations for such altruistic behaviour were predominantly based on kin selection. recent evidence suggests that direct benefits may be important in the maintenance of cooperation. To date. however. discussions of cooperative breeding have made little reference to more general theories of cooperation between unrelated individuals (while these theories rarely address cooperative breeding). Here. we attempt to integrate the two fields. We identify four key questions that can be used to categorise different mechanisms for the maintenance of cooperative behaviour: (1) whether or not individuals invest in others; (2) whether or not this initial investment elicits a return investment by the beneficiary; (3) whether the interaction is direct. i.e. between two partners. or indirect (involving third parties) and (4) whether …,True,vmHei9gAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,277,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635707001866,9494525902318943737,/scholar?cites=9494525902318943737,,https://doc.rero.ch/record/28332/files/Bergm_ller_Ralph_-_Integrating_cooperative_breeding_into_theoretical_20120124.pdf,0,0,0

However. the benefits to offspring of being fed by parents and helpers in cooperatively breeding birds can be difficult to detect.

In addition. it remains an evolutionary puzzle: studies have largely failed to account for diminishing selection on reproduction beyond 50 years. Using a 200‐year dataset on pre‐industrial Finns. we show that an important component is between‐generation reproductive conflict among unrelated women. Simultaneous reproduction by successive generations of in‐laws was associated with declines in offspring survivorship of up to 66%. An inclusive fitness model revealed that incorporation of the fitness consequences of simultaneous intergenerational reproduction between in‐laws. with those of grandmothering and risks of dying in childbirth. were sufficient to generate selection against continued reproduction beyond 51 years.

However. the reproductive consequences of such prebirth sex-ratio effects for offspring and their implications for maternal fitness remain unexplored. Here we investigate the effects of being gestated with a male co-twin for daughter lifetime reproductive success. and the fitness consequences for mothers of producing mixed-sex twins in preindustrial (1734–1888) Finns. We show that daughters born with a male co-twin have reduced lifetime reproductive success compared to those born with a female co-twin. This reduction arises because such daughters have decreased probabilities of marrying as well as reduced fecundity.

However. we currently know little about how such flexibility affects the ways in which parenting is adapted and evolves in response to environmental variation. This is because few studies quantify how individuals vary in their response to changing environments. especially social environments created by other individuals with which parents interact. Social environmental factors differ from nonsocial factors. such as food availability. because parents and offspring both contribute and respond to the social environment they experience. This interdependence leads to the coevolution of flexible behaviors involved in parenting. which could. paradoxically. constrain the ability of individuals to rapidly adapt to changes in their nonsocial environment.,True,vmHei9gAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C,99,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6198/776.abstract,18259667980460852245,/scholar?cites=18259667980460852245,,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/17568/Royle%20et%20al_Science_2014_accepted.docx?sequence=1,0,0,0

An individual’s investment rules will determine the fitness consequences of helping for breeders and helpers. and the aim of this study was to examine how individual investment varied with the number of carers. Provisioning behaviour was investigated in two ways. First. observations of natural variation showed that males and females reduced their provisioning effort when aided by one helper. but showed no further reduction with additional helpers. By contrast. helpers did not adjust their provisioning effort in relation to the number of helpers at a nest.

Recent studies have dramatically reshaped views of polyploid evolution. demonstrating that most polyploid species examined. both plant and animal. have formed recurrently from different populations of their progenitors. Populations of independent origin can subsequently come into contact and hybridize. generating new genotypes. Because of the frequency of polyploidy in plants. many recognized species are probably polyphyletic. Extensive and rapid genome restructuring can occur after polyploidization.

Despite advances in molecular systematics. some hypotheses of relationships remain weakly resolved. Inferring deep phylogenies with bouts of rapid diversification can be problematic; however. genome-scale data should significantly increase the number of informative characters for analyses. Recent phylogenomic reconstructions focused on the major divergences of plants have resulted in promising but inconsistent results.

Ltd,Enormous strides have been made in the study of polyploidy over the last 20 yr. Here. we highlight some of these discoveries and note where our understanding of polyploid evolution has changed. Genetic and genomic studies have dramatically altered the polyploidy paradigm. The estimated frequency of polyploidy has increased. and it is now recognized that multiple origins are the rule for most polyploids. Likewise. autopolyploidy is much more common than traditionally maintained. Rapid genomic rearrangements. genomic downsizing. movement of genetic elements across genomes. and the movement of foreign genetic materials into the polyploid genome illustrate the complex dynamics of polyploid genomes. Following polyploidization. both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in altering gene expression.

Given recent methodological improvements in estimating divergence times. refined understanding of relationships among major angiosperm lineages. and the immense interest in using large angiosperm phylogenies to investigate questions in ecology and comparative biology. new estimates of the ages of the major clades are badly needed. Improved estimations of divergence times will concomitantly improve our understanding of both the evolutionary history of the angiosperms and the patterns and processes that have led to this highly diverse clade.• Methods: We simultaneously estimated the age of the angiosperms and the divergence times of key angiosperm lineages. using 36 calibration points for 567 taxa and a “relaxed clock” methodology that does not assume any correlation …,True,tQynSj0AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,768,https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.0900346,15703667801264710457,/scholar?cites=15703667801264710457,,https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.3732/ajb.0900346,0,0,0

1170379,Phylogenetic consequences of cytoplasmic gene flow in plants,1991,Loren Henry Rieseberg and DE Soltis,,,,,Evolutionary Trends in Plants,Despite the potential power and extensive use of DNA variation for phylogenetic reconstruction. it has become increasingly apparent that DNA phylogenies are often discordant with organismal phylogenies. Factors responsible for discordance include sampling error. convergence. evolutionary rate heterogeneity. lineage sorting. and reticulation. Of these five factors. reticulation is perhaps the most likely to lead to faulty phylogenetic conclusions in plants due to their high potential for interspecific gene now. This problem is particularly acute for the clonally inherited cytoplasmic genomes (mitochondrial and chloroplast). where evidence of reticulation would be most easily missed. We found evidence for over 36 examples of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) capture through hybridization/introgression. many of which were unexpected. In many instances. cytoplasmic exchange appears to have occurred in the absence of significant nuclear gene now and sometimes the native cytoplasm has been completely displaced by an alien one. Theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that differential cytoplasmic exchange can occur by a variety of processes and with remarkable speed. Unfortunately. it is difficult to demarcate a taxonomic zone of safety because unexpected events of chloroplast capture can occur at a variety of taxonomic levels: among closely related. species. at the sectional level within a genus. and at the generic level. In addition. cytoplasmic transfer between major evolutionary lines during early stages of their divergence has the potential to impact cpDNA phylogenetic reconstruction at all taxonomic levels in angiosperms.Several approaches …,True,tQynSj0AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,733,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Soltis/publication/262005952_Phylogenetic_consequences_of_cytoplasmic_gene_flow_in_plants/links/5555fde908ae980ca60c7f67/Phylogenetic-consequences-of-cytoplasmic-gene-flow-in-plants.pdf,3320384917809261079,/scholar?cites=3320384917809261079,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Soltis/publication/262005952_Phylogenetic_consequences_of_cytoplasmic_gene_flow_in_plants/links/5555fde908ae980ca60c7f67/Phylogenetic-consequences-of-cytoplasmic-gene-flow-in-plants.pdf,0,0,0

We posited that these differences would be reflected in their respective genomes. To test this. we sequenced to completion the genomes of Xenorhabdus nematophila ATCC 19061 and Xenorhabdus bovienii SS-2004. As expected. both Xenorhabdus genomes encode many anti-insecticidal compounds. commensurate with their entomopathogenic lifestyle. Despite the similarities in lifestyle between Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria. a comparative analysis of the Xenorhabdus. Photorhabdus luminescens. and P. asymbiotica genomes suggests genomic divergence.

Whole-genome duplication (WGD; polyploidization—ubiquitous in plant evolution [2]) provides the opportunity to evaluate the predictability of genome reduction. a pervasive feature of evolution [3. 4]. Repeated patterns of genome reduction appear to have occurred via duplicated gene (homeolog) loss in divergent species following ancient WGD [5. 6. 7. 8. 9]. with evidence for preferential retention of duplicates in certain gene classes [8. 9. 10]. The speed at which these patterns arise is unknown.

1170423,Progress toward understanding heterosis in crop plants,2013,Patrick S Schnable and Nathan M Springer,64,,,71-88,Annual Reviews,Although heterosis. or hybrid vigor. is widely exploited in agriculture. a complete description of its molecular underpinnings has remained elusive despite extensive investigation. It appears that there is not a single. simple explanation for heterosis. Instead. it is likely that heterosis arises in crosses between genetically distinct individuals as a result of a diversity of mechanisms. Heterosis generally results from the action of multiple loci. and different loci affect heterosis for different traits and in different hybrids. Hence. multigene models are likely to prove most informative for understanding heterosis. Complementation of allelic variation. as well as complementation of variation in gene content and gene expression patterns. is likely to be an important contributor to heterosis. Epigenetic variation has the potential to interact in hybrid genotypes via novel mechanisms.

Here. we show that seed shattering in sorghum is controlled by a single gene. Shattering1 (Sh1). which encodes a YABBY transcription factor. Domesticated sorghums harbor three different mutations at the Sh1 locus. Variants at regulatory sites in the promoter and intronic regions lead to a low level of expression. a 2.2-kb deletion causes a truncated transcript that lacks exons 2 and 3. and a GT-to-GG splice-site variant in the intron 4 results in removal of the exon 4. The distributions of these non-shattering haplotypes among sorghum landraces suggest three independent origins. The function of the rice ortholog (OsSh1) was subsequently validated with a shattering-resistant mutant. and two maize orthologs (ZmSh1-1 and ZmSh1-5.1+ZmSh1-5.2) were verified with a large mapping population.

1170428,Gene mapping via bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq),2012,Sanzhen Liu and Cheng-Ting Yeh and Ho Man Tang and Dan Nettleton and Patrick S Schnable,7,PloS one,5,e36406,Public Library of Science,Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) is an efficient method to rapidly and efficiently map genes responsible for mutant phenotypes. BSA requires access to quantitative genetic markers that are polymorphic in the mapping population. We have developed a modification of BSA (BSR-Seq) that makes use of RNA-Seq reads to efficiently map genes even in populations for which no polymorphic markers have been previously identified. Because of the digital nature of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. it is possible to conduct de novo SNP discovery and quantitatively genotype BSA samples by analyzing the same RNA-Seq data using an empirical Bayesian approach. In addition. analysis of the RNA-Seq data provides information on the effects of the mutant on global patterns of gene expression at no extra cost. In combination these results greatly simplify gene cloning experiments. To demonstrate the utility of this strategy BSR-Seq was used to clone the glossy3 (gl3) gene of maize. Mutants of the glossy loci exhibit altered accumulation of epicuticular waxes on juvenile leaves. By subjecting the reference allele of gl3 to BSR-Seq. we were able to map the gl3 locus to an ∼2 Mb interval. The single gene located in the ∼2 Mb mapping interval whose expression was down-regulated in the mutant pool was subsequently demonstrated to be the gl3 gene via the analysis of multiple independent transposon induced mutant alleles. The gl3 gene encodes a putative myb transcription factor. which directly or indirectly affects the expression of a number of genes involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids.,True,UW4mNTW0nOkC:ILKRHgRFtOwC,233,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036406,8361806172438492351,/scholar?cites=8361806172438492351,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036406,0,0,0

Indeed. most angiosperm species have undergone at least one round of polyploidy in their evolutionary history. Despite enormous progress in our understanding of many aspects of polyploidy. we essentially have no information about the role of chromosome divergence in the establishment of young polyploid populations. Here we investigate synthetic lines and natural populations of two recently and recurrently formed allotetraploids Tragopogon mirus and T. miscellus (formed within the past 80 years) to assess the role of aberrant meiosis in generating chromosomal/genomic diversity. That diversity is likely important in the formation. establishment and survival of polyploid populations and species.  Methodology/Principal Findings Applications of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to natural populations of T. mirus and T. miscellus suggest that chromosomal rearrangements and other chromosomal changes are common in both allotetraploids. We detected extensive chromosomal polymorphism between individuals and populations. including (i) plants monosomic and trisomic for particular chromosomes (perhaps indicating compensatory trisomy). (ii) intergenomic translocations and (iii) variable sizes and expression patterns of individual ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci. We even observed karyotypic variation among sibling plants.

Whole-genome duplication (WGD; polyploidization—ubiquitous in plant evolution [2]) provides the opportunity to evaluate the predictability of genome reduction. a pervasive feature of evolution [3. 4]. Repeated patterns of genome reduction appear to have occurred via duplicated gene (homeolog) loss in divergent species following ancient WGD [5. 6. 7. 8. 9]. with evidence for preferential retention of duplicates in certain gene classes [8. 9. 10].

Hoffmannseggia consisted of herbaceous or sub-shrubby perennials (rather than trees or vines) that lack spines and usually bear glandular trichomes on portions of the vegetative surfaces. However. the lack of correspondence of other characters such as flower shape. fruit type. and sepal persistence with habit and armament led to the repeated realignment of various species. Recent molecular work has shown that Hoffmannseggia forms a monophyletic group supported with several morphological synapomorphies and that it is not closely related to either Caesalpinia or Pomaria.

One indication that polyploidy has substantial stoichiometric consequences for cytonuclear interactions is that organelle-targeted genes appear to be one of the first and most overrepresented classes of nuclear genes to return to single copy following a WGD (De Smet et al.. 2013). although there may be considerable variation in sensitivity to gene dosage imbalance across different functional pathways within the organelles (Coate et al.. 2011). Additionally. the well-known positive relationship between nuclear genome size and cell size (Beaulieu et al.. 2008) indicates that plants may be capable of harboring more organelles per cell as nuclear genome copy number and cell size increases (Fig. 1). Indeed. cotton and alfalfa polyploids exhibit elevated chloroplast number per cell relative to diploids (Bingham. 1968; Krishnaswami and Andal. 1978). and chloroplast number per cell. but not chloroplast size. scales with ploidy in maize (Rhoades and Dempsey. 1966).

Most of our knowledge of the genomic consequences of allopolyploidy has focused on the fate of the duplicated nuclear genes without regard to their potential interactions with cytoplasmic genomes. As a step toward understanding the fates of nuclear-encoded subunits that are plastid-targeted. here we examine the retention and expression of the gene encoding the small subunit of Ribulose-1. 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; rbcS) in multiple populations of allotetraploid Tragopogon miscellus (Asteraceae). These polyploids formed recently (~80 years ago) and repeatedly from T. dubius and T. pratensis in the northwestern United States. Examination of 79 T. miscellus individuals from 10 natural populations. as well as 25 synthetic allotetraploids. including reciprocally formed plants. revealed a low percentage of naturally occurring individuals that show a bias in either gene (homeolog) loss (12%) or expression (16%). usually toward maintaining the maternal nuclear copy of rbcS. For individuals showing loss. seven retained the maternally derived rbcS homeolog only. while three had the paternally derived copy. All of the synthetic polyploid individuals examined (S0 and S1 generations) retained and expressed both parental homeologs.

This hypothesis. proposed by H. G. Baker 40 years ago is based largely on the observation that self‐compatibility is particularly frequent among colonists of oceanic islands. Here we argue that the principle of Baker's Law applies equally in the context of a metapopulation in which frequent local extinction is balanced by recolonization of sites by seed dispersal: metapopulation dynamics will select for an ability to self‐fertilize.

Despite its intuitive appeal and broad empirical support. it has received substantial criticism over the years since it was proclaimed in the 1950s. not least because it seemed to be contradicted by the high frequency of dioecy on islands. Recent theoretical work has again questioned the generality and scope of Baker's law. Here. we attempt to discern where the idea is useful to apply and where it is not.

As a result. the sexual system (i.e. the mating system and the sex allocation of a species) will necessarily play a key role in determining the fate of a new polyploid lineage. The effects of the sexual system on the evolution of polyploidy are complex and interactive. They include both aspects of the genetic system. the genetic load maintained in a population and the ecological context in which selection takes place.

However. population genetic studies of polyploid organisms have been hampered by difficulties associated with scoring and interpreting molecular data. This occurs because the presence of multiple alleles at each locus often precludes the measurement of genotype or allele frequencies. In allopolyploids. the problem is compounded because genetically distinct isoloci frequently share alleles. As a result. analysis of genetic diversity patterns in allopolyploids has tended to rely on the interpretation of phenotype frequencies. which loses information available from allele composition. Here. we propose the use of a simple allelic-phenotype diversity statistic (H′) that measures diversity as the average number of alleles by which pairs of individuals differ.

As a result. self‐compatibility should be common among colonizing species. This idea. labelled ‘Baker's law’. has been influential in discussions of sexual‐system and mating‐system evolution. However. its generality has been questioned. because models of the evolution of dispersal and the mating system predict an association between high dispersal rates and outcrossing rather than selfing. and because of many apparent counter examples to the law.

The smaller size of females in woody species has been attributed to higher reproductive costs. yet no satisfactory explanation has been provided for their larger size in herbs.

To test this hypothesis. we conducted three experiments on the annual dioecious herb Mercurialis annua.

This integration is hypothesized to mediate sensing of ECM rigidity. but parsing the function of nucleus-cytoskeleton linkage from other mechanisms has remained a central challenge. Here we took advantage of the fact that the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex is a known molecular linker of the nucleus to the cytoskeleton. and asked how it regulates the sensitivity of genome-wide transcription to substratum rigidity. We show that gene mechanosensitivity is preserved after LINC disruption. but reversed in direction.

We describe a methodology to identify AS events and identify conserved AS events across large phylogenetic distances using RNA-Seq datasets. We applied this methodology to transcriptome data from nine angiosperms including Amborella. the single sister species to all other extant flowering plants. AS events within 40 – 70% of the expressed multi-exonic genes per species were found. 27.120 of which are conserved among two or more of the taxa studied. While many events are species specific. many others are shared across long evolutionary distances suggesting they have functional significance. Conservation of AS event data provides an estimate of the number of ancestral AS events present at each node of the tree representing the 9 species studied. Furthermore. the presence or absence of AS isoforms between species with different whole genome duplication (WGD) histories provides the opportunity to examine the impact of WDG on AS potential. Examining AS in gene families identifies those with high rates of AS. and conservation can distinguish ancient events vs. recent or species specific adaptations.

1171767,Eutrophication-like response to climate warming: an analysis of Lago Maggiore (N. Italy) zooplankton in contrasting years,2008,Anna Visconti and Marina Manca and Riccardo De Bernardi,67,Journal of Limnology,2,87,PAGEPress Publications,Global mean surface temperatures are increasing. All ecosystems are likely to be affected and there is much interest at present in predicting the effects. In freshwater environments. we expect to observe. among other things. effects similar to those observed under eutrophication. such as increases in zooplankton population density and biomass as a result of enhanced population growth rates. Lago Maggiore underwent rapid eutrophication during the 60s and 70s. with a return to oligotrophy during the 80s and the 90s. Thus. it provides a case study to test the hypothesized eutrophication-like effects of recent climate warming. More specifically. we compare zooplankton biomass and density during the exceptionally warm years of the recent oligotrophic phase with values during the non-warm years of oligotrophy. and during years of the mesotrophic phase. This permits an analysis of zooplankton biomass and density with respect to temperature increase compared with the effects of eutrophication. Zooplankton population density and biomass sharply increased in 2003. the warmest year of the last century. as a result of Cladocera. particularly Daphnia. attaining values typical of the mesotrophic phase. These values were exceptional compared to typical values and were strongly different from those attained during cooler years since re-oligotrophication. Mean annual values of zooplankton density and biomass recorded in 2003 were fully comparable to typical values during the mesotrophic period. This observation confirms the hypothesis of an overall eutrophication-like effect of climate warming.

We applied the guild-ratio. an index based on the proportion of functional groups of rotifers (ie microphagous and raptorial species). on a long-term data set of Lago Maggiore. By applying seasonal trend decomposition based on smoothing techniques and non-metrical multidimensional scaling. we assessed the response of rotifer functional groups to changes in trophic state and climate. While the taxon-based indices showed smooth changes. the function-based index showed a dramatic shift from a raptorial to a microphagous dominance. with a back-shift to raptorial dominance starting in 2000. The seasonal peak of microphagous and raptorial dry weight was clearly separated in the pre-eutrophication period. When mesotrophic conditions prevailed both peaks overlapped. only to be separated again with re-oligotrophication. We attributed these alterations of rotifer functional groups to changes in competition with crustacean zooplankton and to decreased phytoplankton algal abundance and size while altered seasonality in functional groups could be related to inter-group competition for food. We hypothesise that the effects of trophic state (ie altered phytoplankton) and climate (ie altered cladoceran community) were transferred across trophic levels to rotifer functional groups.

Although this phenomenon has often been viewed as problematic in the fields of ecology. taxonomy and systematics. it has become a primary source of data for studies on speciation and adaptation. Effects from genetic/evolutionary processes. such as recombination and natural selection. usually develop over extended periods of time; however. they are accelerated in cases of hybridization. Interspecific hybrids exhibit novel genomes that are exposed to natural selection. thus providing a key to unravel the ultimate causes of adaptation and speciation.

Phylogenetically. they are riven with controversy. Previous morphology-based phylogenetic studies have been greatly hampered by rampant parallelism in morphological characters or by incomplete taxon sampling. Based on sequences of nuclear 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA as well as mitochondrial 16S rRNA and COI DNA from 56 taxa. we reconstructed the phylogeny of Euthyneura utilising Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The evolution of colonization of freshwater and terrestrial habitats by pulmonate Euthyneura. considered crucial in the evolution of this group of Gastropoda. is reconstructed with Bayesian approaches. We found several well supported clades within Euthyneura. however. we could not confirm the traditional classification. since Pulmonata are paraphyletic and Opistobranchia are either polyphyletic or paraphyletic with several clades clearly distinguishable. Sacoglossa appear separately from the rest of the Opisthobranchia as sister taxon to basal Pulmonata. Within Pulmonata. Basommatophora are paraphyletic and Hygrophila and Eupulmonata form monophyletic clades. Pyramidelloidea are placed within Euthyneura rendering the Euthyneura paraphyletic.

Pulmonata),2006,Markus Pfenninger and Mathilde Cordellier and Bruno Streit,6,BMC Evolutionary Biology,1,1-14,BioMed Central,Reliable taxonomic identification at the species level is the basis for many biological disciplines. In order to distinguish species. it is necessary that taxonomic characters allow for the separation of individuals into recognisable. homogeneous groups that differ from other such groups in a consistent way. We compared here the suitability and efficacy of traditionally used shell morphology and DNA-based methods to distinguish among species of the freshwater snail genus Radix (Basommatophora. Pulmonata). Morphometric analysis showed that shell shape was unsuitable to define homogeneous. recognisable entities. because the variation was continuous. On the other hand. the Molecularly defined Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTU). inferred from mitochondrial COI sequence variation. proved to be congruent with biological species. inferred from geographic distribution patterns. congruence with nuclear markers and crossing experiments. Moreover. it could be shown that the phenotypically plastic shell variation is mostly determined by the environmental conditions experienced. Contrary to DNA-taxonomy. shell morphology was not suitable for delimiting and recognising species in Radix. As the situation encountered here seems to be widespread in invertebrates. we propose DNA-taxonomy as a reliable. comparable. and objective means for species identification in biological research.,True,iPlxdC0AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,143,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-6-100,9440225542223104232,/scholar?cites=9440225542223104232,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-6-100,0,0,0

Copper toxicity and bioaccumulation studies were therefore performed using earthworms and oribatid mites. Field-simulating experiments in soil-filled plastic containers showed that earthworms try to escape moderately toxic situations and that they are much more sensitive than oribatid mites to temporary high Cu2+ concentrations in soils. The total copper concentration in the bodies of the earthworm species Octolasium cyaneum was measured in experiments with different soil types and different amounts of added CuSO4. The copper concentrations in the earthworms increased in response to the higher concentrations of the copper fraction extractable with 2.5% acetic acid in the soil.

However. as each ancient lake has its own geological and evolutionary history. modes of speciation may differ from system to system. Ancient lakes can act as evolutionary reservoirs that assure the survival of relict species. but at the same time extant species may evolve through intralacustrine speciation. Other aspects of interest are the actual rates of immigration. diversification or extinction as well as the temporal framework of morphological change. Many of these questions have been addressed in the African (e.g. Lake Tanganyika) and Asian (e.g. Lake Baikal) ancient lakes.

Human activities have drastically altered natural concentrations of many substances in the environment and added numerous new chemicals.

Bioaccumulation therefore results from complex interactions between various routes of uptake. excretion. passive release. and metabolization. For fish. the bioaccumulation process includes two routes of uptake: aqueous uptake of water-borne chemicals. and dietary uptake by ingestion of contaminated food particles. The contribution to bioaccumulation that results from aqueous exposure and is taken up by the gills is called bioconcentration.

Extrapolation from laboratory to field thus depends on an understanding and ability to simulate effects resulting from these types of exposure. This paper reviews models that may be used to predict effects on aquatic organisms resulting from time‐varying exposure to pesticides. We evaluate and compare the theoretical basis of these models and their applicability to the simulation of effects from fluctuating exposures. The many different models rest on only a few basic concepts with differing degrees of mechanistic character.

Even though some insecticides which are used to control pests in agriculture can interfere with feeding behavior of insects and other invertebrates. the link from chemical exposure via affected feeding activity to impaired life history traits. such as survival. has not received much attention in ecotoxicology. One of these insecticides is the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. a neurotoxic substance acting specifically on the insect nervous system. We show that imidacloprid has the potential to indirectly cause lethality in aquatic invertebrate populations at low. sublethal concentrations by impairing movements and thus feeding. We investigated feeding activity. lipid content. immobility. and survival of the aquatic arthropod Gammarus pulex under exposure to imidacloprid. We performed experiments with 14 and 21 days duration. both including two treatments with two high. one day pulses of imidacloprid and one treatment with a low. constant concentration. Feeding of G. pulex as well as lipid content were significantly reduced under exposure to the low. constant imidacloprid concentration (15 µg/L). Organisms were not able to move and feed – and this caused high mortality after 14 days of constant exposure. In contrast. feeding and lipid content were not affected by repeated imidacloprid pulses. In these treatments. animals were mostly immobilized during the chemical pulses but did recover relatively fast after transfer to clean water.

Inc.,Recent advances in modeling the processes of the toxicity of chemicals—toxicokinetics (TK) and toxicodynamics (TD)—are improving environmental risk assessment (ERA) through prediction of effects from time‐varying exposure. This has been achieved by linking chemical fate and toxicological effects mechanistically. based on internal concentrations. through the tissue residue approach. However. certain questions remain: for example. how do TK and TD differ among species and how does this relate to differences in species sensitivity? In a series of experiments. we studied the TK of [14C]chlorpyrifos in 15 freshwater arthropod species. two of which were studied in juvenile and adult life stages.

We use the semimechanistic threshold damage model (TDM) to simulate survival of the aquatic invertebrate Gammarus pulex after sequential pulsed exposure to carbaryl and compare it to a simpler model based on time-weighted averages (TWA). The TDM is a process-based model and we demonstrate how to parametrize it with data from an uptake and elimination experiment together with data from a survival experiment with sequential pulses. The performance of the two models is compared by the fit to the first survival experiment and the simulation of another. independent survival experiment with different exposure patterns.

Many eDNA studies in aquatic systems have focused on lake or ponds. and/or on large vertebrate species. but applications to invertebrates in river systems are emerging. A challenge in applying eDNA monitoring in flowing waters is that a species' DNA can be transported downstream. Whether and how far eDNA can be detected due to downstream transport remains largely unknown. In this study we tested for downstream detection of eDNA for two invertebrate species. Daphnia longispina and Unio tumidus. which are lake dwelling species in our study area. The goal was to determine how far away from the source population in a lake their eDNA could be detected in an outflowing river. We sampled water from eleven river sites in regular intervals up to 12.3 km downstream of the lake. developed new eDNA probes for both species. and used a standard PCR and Sanger sequencing detection method to confirm presence of each species' eDNA in the river. We detected D. longispina at all locations and across two time points (July and October); whereas with U. tumidus. we observed a decreased detection rate and did not detect its eDNA after 9.1 km. We also observed a difference in detection for this species at different times of year. The observed movement of eDNA from the source amounting to nearly 10 km for these species indicates that the resolution of an eDNA sample can be large in river systems.

This physical organisation influences the dispersal of organisms. which ultimately affects metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity patterns. We provide a conceptual synthesis of the role of river networks in structuring metacommunities in relation to dispersal processes in riverine ecosystems. We explore where the river network best explains observed metacommunity structure compared to other measurements of physical connectivity.

The monoculture effect is well‐known from crop studies and may be partially specific to the artificial situation in agriculture. The effect received little attention in animal populations of different diversities. Compared with plants. animals are mobile and exhibiting social interactions.

Importantly. spatial dynamics can be deeply affected by rapid evolution depending on the ecological context. Using experimental evolution in replicated microcosm landscapes and numerical analyses we show experimentally that the ecological process of range expansions leads to the evolution of increased dispersal. This evolutionary change counter-intuitively feeds back on (macro-) ecological patterns affecting the spatial distribution of population densities. While existing theory suggests that densities decrease from range cores to range margins due to K-selection. we show the reverse to be true when competition is considered explicitly including resource dynamics. We suggest that a dispersal-foraging trade-off. leading to more ‘prudent’foraging at range margins. is the driving mechanism behind the …,True,xczFuuQAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,111,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7844?origin=ppub,11318940441777866815,/scholar?cites=11318940441777866815,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7844?origin=ppub,0,0,0

For European states it became legally binding mainly through the EU-Water Framework Directive (WFD). In order to assess the ecological status of a given water body. aquatic biodiversity data are obtained and compared to a reference water body. The quantified mismatch obtained determines the extent of potential management actions. The current approach to biodiversity assessment is based on morpho-taxonomy. This approach has many drawbacks such as being time consuming. limited in temporal and spatial resolution. and error-prone due to the varying individual taxonomic expertise of the analysts. Novel genomic tools can overcome many of the aforementioned problems and could complement or even replace traditional bioassessment. Yet. a plethora of approaches are independently developed in different institutions. thereby hampering any concerted routine application. The goal of this Action is to nucleate a group of researchers across disciplines with the task to identify gold-standard genomic tools and novel ecogenomic indices for routine application in biodiversity assessments of European fresh-and marine water bodies.

North American crayfish species. particularly of the family Cambaridae. are prominent invaders in freshwaters. defying the “tens rule” which states that only a minority of species introduced to new regions become established. and only a minority of those become invasive and pests. So far. success of cambarid invaders has largely been attributed to rapid maturation. high reproductive output. aggressiveness. and tolerance to pollution. We provide experimental evidence that females of one cambarid species particularly widespread in Europe. the spiny-cheek crayfish Orconectes limosus. are capable of facultative parthenogenesis. Such reproductive mode has never before been recognized in decapods. the most diverse crustacean order. As shown by analysis of seven microsatellite loci. crayfish females kept physically separated from males produced genetically homogeneous offspring identical with maternal individuals; this suggests they reproduced by apomixis. unlike those females which mated with males and had a diverse offspring. Further research is needed to clarify what environmental conditions are necessary for a switch to parthenogenesis in O. limosus. and what role it plays in natural crayfish populations.

Orconectes limosus. was first introduced into European waters in 1890. The first literature record about the occurrence of O. limosus on the territory of the Czech Republic was published almost 100 years later–in 1989. The presence of this species in Czechia. however. was first recorded already in the 1960s. when crayfish were observed in the dead arms and pools adjacent to the river Elbe (Labe) in Central Bohemia. In the following few decades the spiny-cheek crayfish has spread into several larger rivers of the Elbe watershed and some of their smaller tributaries. The eastern part of the country (mostly belonging to the watershed of the river Morava) has not yet been colonised by this species. O. limosus can be found in lower reaches of a number of watercourses of a low stream order. but does not seem to penetrate far upstream in such localities.

We found that the genetic structure can largely be explained by a single colonization event following gradual deglaciation of the Pyrenees ~10 000–15 000 years ago. Nuclear genetic diversity declined steeply from southeast to northwest. suggestive of serial colonization of available habitats with advancing deglaciation.

The structure of these links and their strengths have major consequences for the dynamics and stability of food webs. The existence and strength of particular trophic links has often been assessed using observational data on changes in species abundance through time. Here we show that very strong links can be completely missed by these kinds of analyses when changes in population abundance are accompanied by contemporaneous rapid evolution in the prey or host species. Experimental observations. in rotifer-alga and phage-bacteria chemostats. show that the predator or pathogen can exhibit large-amplitude cycles while the abundance of the prey or host remains essentially constant. We know that the species are tightly linked in these experimental microcosms. but without this knowledge. we would infer from observed patterns in abundance that the species are weakly or not at all linked. Mathematical modeling shows that this kind of cryptic dynamics occurs when there is rapid prey or host evolution for traits conferring defense against attack. and the cost of defense (in terms of tradeoffs with other fitness components) is low. Several predictions of the theory that we developed to explain the rotifer-alga experiments are confirmed in the phage-bacteria experiments. where bacterial evolution could be tracked.

Yet to fully explore phenomena that span multiple levels of the biological hierarchy requires model organisms and systems that feature a comprehensive triad of strong ecological interactions in nature. experimental tractability in diverse contexts and accessibility to modern genomic tools. The water flea Daphnia satisfies these criteria. and genomic approaches capitalizing on the pivotal role Daphnia plays in the functioning of pelagic freshwater food webs will enable investigations of eco-evolutionary dynamics in unprecedented detail.

Behaviorally. the larger fish detected and captured crustaceans that subtended smaller visual angles. Histological examination of the retinas revealed that the distance between cones. measured in minutes of visual angle. decreased as the animals grew. suggesting that the larger retinas could resolve smaller objects. These correlated behavioral and anatomical results suggest that improved visual resolution contributes to improved predation.

We developed a computer simulation of the copepod's life history and used it to compete populations that switched to diapause at different intervals of time before the onset of fish predation (the catastrophe). With no variation about the catastrophe date. the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is one in which the switch to diapause comes exactly one generation before the catastrophe. as Taylor (1980) has shown analytically. With increasing variation about the catastrophe date. the ESS becomes one of switching to diapause at time intervals increasingly greater than one generation.

However. little is known about how the qualitative properties of eco‐evolutionary dynamics (e.g.. cycling. equilibrium. etc.) are affected by the amount of heritable variation present.

Natural selection acting on the timing of diapause fluctuates between years depending upon the population density of fish.

Diapause is earlier in years following high predator density. and is later in years following low predator density.

To design effective pollution management strategies in watersheds with mixed land use. we suggest a screening method that pinpoints the origin of pollutants and identifies relevant flow paths. This takes advantage of the fact. that medium polar micropollutants sorb to sediments. The core of the approach is an expert system based on Bayesian probabilities that updates the experts’ knowledge on potential micropollutant sources in a catchment using monitoring data from a single sediment sample. We are able to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on a real-world case study in the Mönchaltorfer Aa catchment. where micropollutants most probably origin from wastewater and stormwater influents and not from agriculture.

Several challenges currently exist in drug-use epidemiology. including time lags in reporting. poor spatial resolution. reliance on biased data including self-reporting. and an over reliance on morbidity and mortality data. To overcome these limitations. we have initiated an interdisciplinary study that links analytical chemists with epidemiologists and medical researchers in order to estimate the community burden of illicit drugs on a local to regional scale. Illicit drugs of interest include ‘rave’drugs. methamphetamine. and cocaine. To put illicit drug measurements into context. we have included key metabolites and precursors of illicit drugs and population indicators including human urinary biomarkers. To estimate community burdens. samples of raw influent (24 hr. flow-normalized composites) were collected from municipal wastewater treatment plants and analyzed by large-volume (direct) injection. liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.

1171925,Large volume (1.800 µL) injection HPLC/MS/MS for the quantitative determination of illicit drugs and human urinary biomarkers in municipal wastewater,2008,Aurea C Chiaia Hernandez,,,,,,In recent years. researchers have showed that illicit drugs occur at quantifiable concentrations in the raw influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). rivers (1-6). surface water (4. 7). and in lakes (8). Interpretation of analytical data is then used to estimate levels of community drug use and consumption in locations including Ireland. Italy. Switzerland and England (9. 10). The measurement of these illicit drugs and their metabolites in WWTPs allows for the analysis of trends in drug use over time and between locations since WWTPs have known catchment areas with specific geographic boundaries and population estimates (5. 9). In addition. influent and effluent data are used to quantify the removal of illicit drugs and their metabolites during wastewater (3). Wastewater components such as cotinine. the metabolite of nicotine. and caffeine are recognized as molecular markers of wastewater (11-15); however. reports to date focus only on the frequency of detection and corresponding concentrations. Alternatively. we hypothesize that creatinine. which is the end product of phosphocreatinine degradation (16). can be quantified in wastewater due to its universal excretion by humans and. thus. potentially serve as an additional. perhaps more universal. human urinary biomarker than either cotinine or caffeine. Creatinine concentrations excreted by humans range from 0.5 to 3 g/L (17) and data from a recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicated an average creatinine excretion of 1.3 g/L±0.8 for a 7.500 participant study (http://www. cdc. gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/nhanes2007-2008/nhanes07_08. htm …,True,44A-ug8AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1,https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/dspace/handle/1957/9128,11787992496649214630,/scholar?cites=11787992496649214630,,https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/hq37vq546,0,0,0

Here. we give an integrative review of the observed and predicted impacts of climate change on shallow lakes in the Netherlands and put these impacts in an international perspective. Most of these lakes are man-made and have preset water levels and poorly developed littoral zones. Relevant climatic factors for these ecosystems are temperature. ice-cover and wind. Secondary factors affected by climate include nutrient loading. residence time and water levels. We reviewed the relevant literature in order to assess the impact of climate change on these lakes.

However. the relative importance and interaction of warming temperatures and increased nutrient availability in determining cyanobacterial blooms are unknown. We investigated the contribution of these two factors in promoting phytoplankton and cyanobacterial biovolume in freshwater lakes. Specifically. we asked: (1) Which of these two drivers. temperature or nutrients. is a better predictor of cyanobacterial biovolume? (2) Do nutrients and temperature significantly interact to affect phytoplankton and cyanobacteria. and if so. is the interaction synergistic? and (3) Does the interaction between these factors explain more of the variance in cyanobacterial biovolume than each factor alone?

Parasitic fungi of phytoplankton mainly belong to the Chytridiomycetes (chytrids). Here. we discuss the progression made in the study of chytrids that parasitize phytoplankton species. Specific fluorescent stains aid in the identification of chytrids in the field. The established culturing methods and the advances in molecular science offer good potential to gain a better insight into the mechanisms of epidemic development of chytrids and coevolution between chytrids and their algal hosts. Chytrids are often considered to be highly host-specific parasites. but the extent of host specificity has not been fully investigated.

The macrophyte dominated state disappeared in the late 1960s at TP above 0.20 mg l−1. whereas its return occurred at less than 0.10 mg TP l−1. Several regime shifts resulting in the occurrence of three alternative stable states were observed over a period of 30 years. The turbid state showed resistance to change. despite a strong and prompt reduction in Chl-a following reduction of external P-loading.

No single physical–chemical factor has been found that fully explains the dynamics of chytrid epidemics in the field. Fungal periodicity was primarily related to host cell density.

Generally. artificial mixing causes an increase in the oxygen content of the water. an increase in the temperature in the deep layers but a decrease in the upper layers. while the standing crop of phytoplankton (i.e. the chlorophyll content per m2) often increases partly due to an increase in nutrients entrained from the hypolimnion or resuspended from the sediments.

Niche construction theory posits that organism‐mediated modifications to the environment can change selection pressures and influence the evolutionary trajectories of natural populations. While there is broad support for this proposition in general. there is considerable uncertainty about how niche construction is related to other similar concepts in ecology and evolution.

In eutrophic lakes. large amounts of the cyanobacterium Microcystis may overwinter in the sediment and re-inoculate the water column in spring. 2. We monitored changes in pelagic and benthic populations of Microcystis in Lake Volkerak. The Netherlands. In addition. sedimentation rates and the rate of recruitment from the sediment were measured using traps. These data were used to model the coupling between the benthic and pelagic populations and to calculate the contribution of overwintering benthic and pelagic populations to the magnitude of the pelagic summer bloom.3. Changes in the benthic Microcystis population showed a time lag of 3–14 weeks compared with the pelagic population. This time lag increased with lake depth. The largest amount of benthic Microcystis was found in the deepest parts of the lake.

Like other ciliates. this species has separate germline and soma functions that are embodied by distinct nuclei within a single cell. The germline-like micronucleus (MIC) has its genome held in reserve for sexual reproduction. The soma-like macronucleus (MAC). which possesses a genome processed from that of the MIC. is the center of gene expression and does not directly contribute DNA to sexual progeny. We report here the shotgun sequencing. assembly. and analysis of the MAC genome of T. thermophila. which is approximately 104 Mb in length and composed of approximately 225 chromosomes. Overall. the gene set is robust. with more than 27.000 predicted protein-coding genes. 15.000 of which have strong matches to genes in other organisms. The functional diversity encoded by these genes is substantial and reflects the complexity of processes required for a free-living. predatory. single-celled organism.

The oldest group among these are the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). which are plant symbionts harboring hundreds of nuclei within one continuous cytoplasm. Some AMF strains (dikaryons) harbor two co-existing nucleotypes but there is no direct evidence that such nuclei recombine in this life-stage. as is expected for sexual fungi. Here. we show that AMF nuclei with distinct genotypes can undergo recombination. Inter-nuclear genetic exchange varies in frequency among strains. and despite recombination all nuclear genomes have an average similarity of at least 99.8%. The present study demonstrates that AMF can generate genetic diversity via meiotic-like processes in the absence of observable mating.

However. efficient and sustained viral replication within tumours is limiting. Rapamycin can stimulate HSV1 replication in cancer cells. but active-site dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and 2) inhibitors (asTORi) were shown to suppress the virus in normal cells. Surprisingly. using the infected cell protein 0 (ICP0)-deleted HSV1 (HSV1-dICP0). we found that asTORi markedly augment infection in cancer cells and a mouse mammary cancer xenograft. Mechanistically. asTORi repressed mRNA translation in normal cells. resulting in defective antiviral response but also inhibition of HSV1-dICP0 replication. asTORi also reduced antiviral response in cancer cells. however in contrast to normal cells. transformed cells and cells transduced to elevate the expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) or to silence the repressors eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BPs). selectively maintained HSV1-dICP0 protein synthesis during asTORi treatment. ultimately supporting increased viral replication.

On one hand. viruses completely rely on the protein synthesis machinery of host cells to propagate and have evolved various mechanisms to redirect the host's ribosomes toward their viral mRNAs. On the other hand. the host rewires its translation program in an attempt to contain and suppress the virus early on during infection; the antiviral program includes specific control on protein synthesis to translate several antiviral mRNAs involved in quenching the infection. As the infection progresses. host translation is in turn inhibited in order to limit viral propagation.

Heidelberg,Recently. several studies have reported that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance plant diversity of grasslands by specifically stimulating the growth of subordinate. often rare plant species. The underlying mechanisms by which AMF promote growth of such mycorrhizal-dependent plant species are reviewed in this chapter. These mechanisms can be used to explain how AMF promote plant diversity. Here I show that a positive relationship exists between the mycorrhizal dependency of a plant and the amount of phosphorus obtained from AMF. In addition. a re-analysis of previously published material shows that interplant carbon transport through a mycorrhizal hyphal network. from one plant to another. is directed towards plant species with the highest mycorrhizal dependency.

They colonise the interior of the roots and the hyphae extend into the soil. It is well known that bacterial colonisation of the rhizosphere can be crucial for many pathogenic as well as symbiotic plant–microbe interactions. However. although bacteria colonising the extraradical AMF hyphae (the hyphosphere) might be equally important for AMF symbiosis. little is known regarding which bacterial species would colonise AMF hyphae. In this study. we investigated which bacterial communities might be associated with AMF hyphae.

Sequencing the NS genome segment of mouse-adapted variants revealed 11 mutations in the NS1 gene and 4 in the overlapping NEP gene. Using the HK-wt virus and reverse genetics to incorporate mutant NS gene segments. we demonstrated that all NS1 mutations were adaptive and enhanced virus replication (up to 100 fold) in mouse cells and/or lungs. All but one NS1 mutant was associated with increased virulence measured by survival and weight loss in the mouse. Ten of twelve NS1 mutants significantly enhanced IFN-β antagonism to reduce the level of IFN β production relative to HK-wt in infected mouse lungs at 1 day post infection. where 9 mutants induced viral yields in the lung that were equivalent to or significantly greater than HK-wt (up to 16 fold increase). Eight of 12 NS1 mutants had reduced or lost the ability to bind the 30 kDa cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30) thus demonstrating a lack of correlation with reduced IFN β production. Mutant NS1 genes resulted in increased viral mRNA transcription (10 of 12 mutants). and protein production (6 of 12 mutants) in mouse cells. Increased transcription activity was demonstrated in the influenza mini-genome assay for 7 of 11 NS1 mutants.

The emergent A/Shanghai/patient1/2013(H7N9)-like viruses also possess these mutations which may contribute to their virulence and ability to switch species. NS1 mutant viruses were constructed by reverse genetics and site directed mutagenesis on human and mouse-adapted backbones. Mouse infections assessed virulence. virus yield. tissue infection. and IFN induction. NS1 protein properties were assessed for subcellular distribution. IFN antagonism (mouse and human).

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF). a common treatment for psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. also has anticancer properties. We show that DMF and various fumaric and maleic acid esters (FMAEs) enhance viral infection of cancer cell lines as well as human tumor biopsies with several oncolytic viruses (OVs). improving therapeutic outcomes in resistant syngeneic and xenograft tumor models. This results in durable responses. even in models otherwise refractory to OV and drug monotherapies.

Specifically. their obligate intracellular parasitism has resulted in the loss of many genes and biochemical pathways. but these reductive processes have been often offset by the acquisition of several genes by means of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Until recently. these HGTs were all found to have derived from prokaryotic donors. but a recent study suggests that some species took advantage of this mechanism to acquire one gene from an animal. which they maintained in their genome for metabolic purposes.

We have previously characterized gain-of-function mutations in the NS1 protein arising from the experimental adaptation of the human isolate A/Hong Kong/1/1968(H3N2) (HK) to the mouse. The majority of these mouse adapted NS1 mutations were demonstrated to increase virulence. viral fitness. and interferon antagonism. but differ in binding to the post-transcriptional processing factor cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30 (CPSF30). Because nuclear trafficking is a major genetic determinant of influenza virus host adaptation. we assessed subcellular localization and host gene expression of NS1 adaptive mutations. Recombinant HK viruses with adaptive mutations in the NS1 gene were assessed for NS1 protein subcellular localization in mouse and human cells using confocal microscopy and cellular fractionation. In human cells the HK wild-type (HK-wt) virus NS1 protein partitioned equivalently between the cytoplasm and nucleus but was defective in cytoplasmic localization in mouse cells. Several adaptive mutations increased the proportion of NS1 in the cytoplasm of mouse cells with the greatest effects for mutations M106I and D125G. The host gene expression profile of the adaptive mutants was determined by microarray analysis of infected mouse cells to show either high or low extents of host-gene regulation (HGR or LGR) phenotypes.

1172058,Molecular basis of the regulation of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR by the Src homology domain-containing adaptor protein Nck1,2016,Afnan Abu-Thuraia and George Kefalas and Mohammed Selman and Nafisa Tasnim and Louise Larose,17,Current Topics in Biochemical Research,,31 - 44,Research Trends,Tight regulation of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis due to its potent inhibitory role on general translation. However. the endogenous molecular mechanisms that regulate PKR are still largely unknown. We have previously identified the Src homology domain-containing adaptor protein Nck1 as a novel regulator of PKR through its interaction with PKR. In this study. we report that the negative control of PKR by Nck1 is reversible by showing that significant levels of dsRNA override Nck1 binding and inhibition of PKR. Biochemical approaches reveal that Nck1 must be in its full length form to interact with and modulate PKR activation. However. both binding and regulation appear to occur independently of the classical binding function of Nck1 Src-homology domains and the interaction between the two proteins involves two binding sites for Nck1 on PKR. Furthermore. we found that the dissociation of Nck1 from PKR in the presence of significant levels of dsRNA results from the activation of PKR catalytic activity rather than competition by dsRNA or change in PKR conformation. Finally. we provide strong evidence that Nck1 is phosphorylated by PKR in a cellular context. Hence. Nck1 not only buffers PKR activation. but it also appears to be a substrate of PKR. Therefore. we propose that PKR-mediated Nck1 phosphorylation is part of the mechanism that promotes Nck1 dissociation from PKR and leads to efficient activation of PKR.,True,psQm-MUAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Louise_Larose/publication/50279052_Molecular_basis_of_the_regulation_of_the_double-stranded_RNA-activated_protein_kinase_PKR_by_the_Src_homology_domain-containing_adaptor_protein_Nck1/links/58c0204fa6fdcca74cff0abd/Molecular-basis-of-the-regulation-of-the-double-stranded-RNA-activated-protein-kinase-PKR-by-the-Src-homology-domain-containing-adaptor-protein-Nck1.pdf,7899597342296053314,/scholar?cites=7899597342296053314,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Louise_Larose/publication/50279052_Molecular_basis_of_the_regulation_of_the_double-stranded_RNA-activated_protein_kinase_PKR_by_the_Src_homology_domain-containing_adaptor_protein_Nck1/links/58c0204fa6fdcca74cff0abd/Molecular-basis-of-the-regulation-of-the-double-stranded-RNA-activated-protein-kinase-PKR-by-the-Src-homology-domain-containing-adaptor-protein-Nck1.pdf,0,0,0

The basal position of the Prasinophyceae has been well documented. but the divergence order of the Ulvophyceae. Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae is currently debated.

The endosymbiont is separated from its host by a single membrane and retains plastids. mitochondria. a large nucleus. and many other eukaryotic organelles and structures. a level of complexity suggesting an early stage of integration. Although the evolution of these endosymbionts has attracted considerable interest. the plastid genome has not been examined in detail. and indeed no tertiary plastid genome has yet been sequenced.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe the complete plastid genomes of two closely related dinotoms. Durinskia baltica and Kryptoperidinium foliaceum. The D. baltica (116470 bp) and K. foliaceum (140426 bp) plastid genomes map as circular molecules featuring two large inverted repeats that separate distinct single copy regions. The organization and gene content of the D. baltica plastid closely resemble those of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The K. foliaceum plastid genome is much larger. has undergone more reorganization. and encodes a putative tyrosine recombinase (tyrC) also found in the plastid genome of the heterokont Heterosigma akashiwo. and two putative serine recombinases (serC1 and serC2) homologous to recombinases encoded by plasmids pCf1 and pCf2 in another pennate diatom.

This view on the origin of land plants is now being challenged by recent analyses of chloroplast genome sequences from six charophyceans.

1172073,The mitochondrial genome of the entomoparasitic green alga Helicosporidium,2010,Jean-François Pombert and Patrick J Keeling,5,PloS one,1,e8954,Public Library of Science,Background Helicosporidia are achlorophyllous. non-photosynthetic protists that are obligate parasites of invertebrates. Highly specialized. these pathogens feature an unusual cyst stage that dehisces inside the infected organism and releases a filamentous cell displaying surface projections. which will penetrate the host gut wall and eventually reproduce in the hemolymph. Long classified as incertae sedis or as relatives of other parasites such as Apicomplexa or Microsporidia. the Helicosporidia were surprisingly identified through molecular phylogeny as belonging to the Chlorophyta. a phylum of green algae. Most phylogenetic analyses involving Helicosporidia have placed them within the subgroup Trebouxiophyceae and further suggested a close affiliation between the Helicosporidia and the genus Prototheca. Prototheca species are also achlorophyllous and pathogenic. but they infect vertebrate hosts. inducing protothecosis in humans. The complete plastid genome of an Helicosporidium species was recently described and is a model of compaction and reduction. Here we describe the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the same strain. Helicosporidium sp. ATCC 50920 isolated from the black fly Simulium jonesi.  Methodology/Principal Findings The circular mapping 49343 bp mitochondrial genome of Helicosporidium closely resembles that of the vertebrate parasite Prototheca wickerhamii.

This is evident in many parasites. but perhaps the most extreme transitions are from free-living autotrophic algae to obligate parasites. The best-known examples of this are the apicomplexans such as Plasmodium. which evolved from algae with red secondary plastids. However. an analogous transition also took place independently in the Helicosporidia. where an obligate parasite of animals with an intracellular infection mechanism evolved from algae with green primary plastids. We characterised the nuclear genome of Helicosporidium to compare its transition to parasitism with that of apicomplexans. The Helicosporidium genome is small and compact. even by comparison with the relatively small genomes of the closely related green algae Chlorella and Coccomyxa. but at the functional level we find almost no evidence for reduction. Nearly all ancestral metabolic functions are retained. with the single major exception of photosynthesis. and even here reduction is not complete. The great majority of genes for light-harvesting complexes. photosystems. and pigment biosynthesis have been lost. but those for other photosynthesis-related functions. such as Calvin cycle. are retained. Rather than loss of whole function categories. the predominant reductive force in the Helicosporidium genome is a contraction of gene family complexity. but even here most losses affect families associated with genome maintenance and expression. not functions associated with host-dependence …,True,vXuVRH0AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,52,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004355,10220131316310759497,/scholar?cites=10220131316310759497,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004355,0,0,0

But unlike its prasinophyte counterparts. the plastid genome of the euglenid Euglena gracilis is riddled with introns that interrupt almost every protein-encoding gene. The atypical group II introns and twintrons (introns-within-introns) found in the E. gracilis plastid have been hypothesized to have been acquired late in the evolution of euglenids. implying that massive numbers of introns may be lacking in other taxa. This late emergence was recently corroborated by the plastid genome sequences of the two basal euglenids. Eutreptiella gymnastica and Eutreptia viridis. which were found to contain fewer introns.

The M. aenigmatica UTEX 1284 plastid genome (74.746 bp. 70.6% A+T. 87 genes) contains 53 intron insertion sites. of which 41 were found to be shared with other euglenids including 12 of the 15 twintron insertion sites reported in E. gracilis.   Conclusions The pattern of insertion sites suggests an ongoing but uneven process of intron gain in the lineage. with perhaps a minimum of two bursts of rapid intron proliferation. We also identified several sites that represent intermediates in the process of twintron evolution. where the external intron is in place. but not the internal one. offering a glimpse into how …,True,vXuVRH0AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,29,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053433,5442104143125903269,/scholar?cites=5442104143125903269,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053433,0,0,0

However. their diminutive stature is not characteristic of all Microsporidia. whose genome sizes vary by an order of magnitude. This large variability suggests that different evolutionary forces are applied on the group as a whole. In this study. we have compared the codon usage bias (CUB) between eight taxonomically distinct microsporidian genomes: Encephalitozoon intestinalis. Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Spraguea lophii. Trachipleistophora hominis. Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Nematocida parisii. Nosema bombycis and Nosema ceranae. While the CUB was found to be weak in all eight Microsporidia. nearly all (98%) of the optimal codons in S. lophii. T. hominis. E. bieneusi. N. parisii. N. bombycis and N. ceranae are fond of A/U in third position whereas most (64.6%) optimal codons in the Encephalitozoon species E. intestinalis and E. cuniculi are biased towards G/C. Although nucleotide composition biases are likely the main factor driving the CUB in Microsporidia according to correlation analyses. directed mutational pressure also likely affects the CUB as suggested by ENc-plots. correspondence and neutrality analyses. Overall. the Encephalitozoon genomes were found to be markedly different from the other microsporidians and. despite being the first sequenced representatives of this lineage. are uncharacteristic of the group as a whole.

We sequenced the genome of Ordospora colligata. a gut parasite of the microcrustacean Daphnia sp. and the closest known relative to the microsporidia characterized by the most extreme genomic reduction. the model genus Encephalitozoon. We found that the O. colligata genome is as compact as those of Encephalitozoon spp.. featuring few introns and a similar complement of about 2.000 genes. altogether showing that the extreme reduction took place before the origin of Encephalitozoon spp. and their adaptation to vertebrate hosts.

In the work described here this construct (dszAS1BC) and the intact dsz operon (dszABC) cloned into vector pRESX under control of the (Rhodococcus) kstD promoter were transformed into the desulfurization-negative strain CW25 of Rhodococcus qingshengii. The resulting strains (CW25[pRESX-dszABC] and CW25[pRESX-dszAS1BC]) were subjected to adaptive selection by repeated passages at log phase (up to 100 times) in minimal medium with dibenzothiophene (DBT) as sole sulfur source. For both strains DBT metabolism peaked early in the selection process and then decreased. eventually averaging four times that of the initial transformed cells; the maximum specific activity achieved by CW25[pRESX-dszAS1BC] exceeded that of CW25[pRESX-dszABC]. Growth rates increased by 7-fold (CW25[pRESX-dszABC]) and 13-fold (CW25[pRESX-dszAS1BC]) and these increases were stable. The adaptations of CW25[pRESX-dszAS1BC] were correlated with a 3-5X increase in plasmid copy numbers from those of the initial transformed cells; whole genome sequencing indicated that during its selection processes no mutations occurred to any of the dsz.

But almost all non-photosynthetic plants and algae still retain a colorless plastid and an associated genome. which performs fundamental processes apart from photosynthesis. Unfortunately. little is known about the forces leading to photosynthetic loss; this is largely because there is a lack of data from transitional species.

Splicing of these mobile genetic occurs at the RNA level via serial transesterification steps catalyzed by the introns'own tertiary structures and. sometimes. with the help of external factors. These catalytic ribozymes can be found in cis or trans configuration. and although trans-arrayed group II introns have been known for decades. trans-spliced group I introns have been reported only recently. In the course of sequencing the complete mitochondrial genome of the prasinophyte picoplanktonic green alga Prasinoderma coloniale CCMP 1220 (Prasinococcales. clade VI). we uncovered two additional cases of trans-spliced group I introns. Here. we describe these introns and compare the 54.546 bp-long mitochondrial genome of Prasinoderma with those of four other prasinophytes (clades II. III and V). This comparison underscores the highly variable mitochondrial genome architecture in these ancient chlorophyte lineages. Both Prasinoderma trans-spliced introns reside within the large subunit rRNA gene (rnl) at positions where cis-spliced relatives. often containing homing endonuclease genes. have been found in other organelles. In contrast. all previously reported trans-spliced group I introns occur in different mitochondrial genes (rns or coxI). Each Prasinoderma intron is fragmented into two pieces. forming at the RNA level a secondary structure that resembles those of its cis-spliced counterparts. As observed for other trans-spliced group I introns. the breakpoint of the first intron maps to the variable loop L8. whereas that of the second is uniquely located downstream of P9.1 …,True,vXuVRH0AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,15,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0084325,14848763826287914919,/scholar?cites=14848763826287914919,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0084325,0,0,0

This distribution has fueled debate concerning whether. in sites where it has recently been found. the pathogen was introduced or is endemic. In this study. we addressed the molecular population genetics of a global collection of fungal strains from both declining and healthy amphibian populations using DNA sequence variation from 17 nuclear loci and a large fragment from the mitochondrial genome. We found a low rate of DNA polymorphism. with only two sequence alleles detected at each locus. but a high diversity of diploid genotypes. Half of the loci displayed an excess of heterozygous genotypes. consistent with a primarily clonal mode of reproduction. Despite the absence of obvious sex. genotypic diversity was high (44 unique genotypes out of 59 strains). We provide evidence that the observed genotypic variation can be generated by loss of heterozygosity through mitotic recombination. One strain isolated from a bullfrog possessed as much allelic diversity as the entire global sample. suggesting the current epidemic can be traced back to the outbreak of a single clonal lineage. These data are consistent with the current chytridiomycosis epidemic resulting from a novel pathogen undergoing a rapid and recent range expansion. The widespread occurrence of the same lineage in both healthy and declining populations suggests that the outcome of the disease is contingent on environmental factors and host resistance.,True,o4P-T2sAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,255,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000458,2713825894556676401,/scholar?cites=2713825894556676401,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000458,0,0,0

They have the same chromosome number and genome sizes. and they occupy the same ecological niche. To explore the basis for this striking conservation of structure and function. we have sequenced the C. briggsae genome to a high-quality draft stage and compared it to the finished C. elegans sequence. We predict approximately 19.500 protein-coding genes in the C. briggsae genome. roughly the same as in C. elegans. Of these. 12.200 have clear C. elegans orthologs. a further 6.500 have one or more clearly detectable C. elegans homologs. and approximately 800 C. briggsae genes have no detectable matches in C. elegans. Almost all of the noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two species. The two genomes exhibit extensive colinearity. and the rate of divergence appears to be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the centers. Operons. a distinctive feature of C. elegans. are highly conserved in C. briggsae. with the arrangement of genes being preserved in 96% of cases. The difference in size between the C. briggsae (estimated at approximately 104 Mbp) and C. elegans (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost entirely due to repetitive sequence. which accounts for 22.4% of the C. briggsae genome in contrast to 16.5% of the C. elegans genome.

The increase in fungal genome sequencing presents an opportunity to reconstruct evolutionary events using entire genomes. As a tool for future comparative. phylogenomic and phylogenetic studies. we used both supertrees and concatenated alignments to infer relationships between 42 species of fungi for which complete genome sequences are available. A dataset of 345.829 genes was extracted from 42 publicly available fungal genomes. Supertree methods were employed to derive phylogenies from 4.805 single gene families. We found that the average consensus supertree method may suffer from long-branch attraction artifacts. while matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) appears to be immune from these. A genome phylogeny was also reconstructed from a concatenated alignment of 153 universally distributed orthologs. Our MRP supertree and concatenated phylogeny are highly congruent. Within the Ascomycota. the sub-phyla Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina were resolved. Both phylogenies infer that the Leotiomycetes are the closest sister group to the Sordariomycetes.

1172128,The evolution of mammalian gene families,2006,Jeffery P Demuth and Tijl De Bie and Jason E Stajich and Nello Cristianini and Matthew W Hahn,1,PloS one,1,e85,Public Library of Science,Gene families are groups of homologous genes that are likely to have highly similar functions. Differences in family size due to lineage-specific gene duplication and gene loss may provide clues to the evolutionary forces that have shaped mammalian genomes. Here we analyze the gene families contained within the whole genomes of human. chimpanzee. mouse. rat. and dog. In total we find that more than half of the 9.990 families present in the mammalian common ancestor have either expanded or contracted along at least one lineage. Additionally. we find that a large number of families are completely lost from one or more mammalian genomes. and a similar number of gene families have arisen subsequent to the mammalian common ancestor. Along the lineage leading to modern humans we infer the gain of 689 genes and the loss of 86 genes since the split from chimpanzees. including changes likely driven by adaptive natural selection. Our results imply that humans and chimpanzees differ by at least 6% (1.418 of 22.000 genes) in their complement of genes. which stands in stark contrast to the oft-cited 1.5% difference between orthologous nucleotide sequences. This genomic “revolving door” of gene gain and loss represents a large number of genetic differences separating humans from our closest relatives.,True,t_YIP5UAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,327,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000085,16592853846697130863,/scholar?cites=16592853846697130863,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000085,0,0,0

It occurs as two serotypes (A and D) representing two varieties (i.e. grubii and neoformans. respectively). Here. we sequenced the genome and performed an RNA-Seq-based analysis of the C. neoformans var. grubii transcriptome structure. We determined the chromosomal locations. analyzed the sequence/structural features of the centromeres. and identified origins of replication. The genome was annotated based on automated and manual curation. More than 40.000 introns populating more than 99% of the expressed genes were identified. Although most of these introns are located in the coding DNA sequences (CDS). over 2.000 introns in the untranslated regions (UTRs) were also identified. Poly(A)-containing reads were employed to locate the polyadenylation sites of more than 80% of the genes. Examination of the sequences around these sites revealed a new poly(A)-site-associated motif (AUGHAH). In addition. 1.197 miscRNAs were identified. These miscRNAs can be spliced and/or polyadenylated. but do not appear to have obvious coding capacities. Finally. this genome sequence enabled a comparative analysis of strain H99 variants obtained after laboratory passage.

However. there are as yet no models of gene family evolution that make it possible to estimate ancestral states or to infer upon which lineages gene families have contracted or expanded. In addition. large differences in family size have generally been attributed to the effects of natural selection. without a strong statistical basis for these conclusions. Here we use a model of stochastic birth and death for gene family evolution and show that it can be efficiently applied to multispecies genome comparisons. This model takes into account the lengths of branches on phylogenetic trees. as well as duplication and deletion rates. and hence provides expectations for divergence in gene family size among lineages.

While next-generation sequencing techniques have revolutionized genome resequencing. e.g. for strain comparisons. genetic mapping. or transcriptome and ChIP analyses. de novo assembly of eukaryotic genomes still presents significant hurdles. because of their large size and stretches of repetitive sequences. Filamentous fungi contain few repetitive regions in their 30–90 Mb genomes and thus are suitable candidates to test de novo genome assembly from short sequence reads.

Although gene and repetitive DNA distributions have been preserved since palaeopolyploidization∼ 70 million years ago. most duplicated gene sets lost one member before the sorghum–rice divergence. Concerted evolution makes one duplicated chromosomal segment appear to be only …,True,Z_xp9ngAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2662,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07723,4648698441458395025,/scholar?cites=4648698441458395025,,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07723,0,0,0

It is a model system for studying chloroplast-based photosynthesis. as well as the structure. assembly. and function of eukaryotic flagella (cilia). which were inherited from the common ancestor of plants and animals. but lost in land plants. We sequenced the ∼120-megabase nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas and performed comparative phylogenomic analyses. identifying genes encoding uncharacterized proteins that are likely associated with the function and biogenesis of chloroplasts or eukaryotic flagella. Analyses of the Chlamydomonas genome advance our understanding of the ancestral eukaryotic cell. reveal previously unknown genes associated with photosynthetic and flagellar functions. and establish links between ciliopathy and the composition and function of flagella.,True,Z_xp9ngAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2415,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/318/5848/245.summary,5058504756941052272,/scholar?cites=5058504756941052272,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2875087/,0,0,0

Here we describe the structure and gene content of the highly polymorphic∼ 520-megabase genome of the Florida lancelet Branchiostoma floridae. and analyse it in the context of chordate evolution. Whole-genome comparisons illuminate the murky relationships among the three chordate groups (tunicates. lancelets and vertebrates). and allow not only reconstruction of the gene complement of the last common chordate ancestor but also partial reconstruction of its genomic organization. as well as a description of two genome-wide duplications and subsequent reorganizations in the vertebrate lineage.
