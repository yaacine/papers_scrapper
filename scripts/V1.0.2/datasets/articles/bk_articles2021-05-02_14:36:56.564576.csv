1282924,TRANSFORM-ANN for online optimization of complex industrial processes: Casting process as case study,2018,Srinivas Soumitri Miriyala and Venkat R Subramanian and Kishalay Mitra,264,European Journal of Operational Research,1,294-309,North-Holland,Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are well known for their credible ability to capture non-linear trends in scientific data. However. the heuristic nature of estimation of parameters associated with ANNs has prevented their evolution into efficient surrogate models. Further. the dearth of optimal training size estimation algorithms for the data greedy ANNs resulted in their overfitting. Therefore. through this work. we aim to contribute a novel ANN building algorithm called TRANSFORM aimed at simultaneous and optimal estimation of ANN architecture. training size and transfer function. TRANSFORM is integrated with three standalone Sobol sampling based training size determination algorithms which incorporate the concepts of hypercube sampling and optimal space filling.

The highly complex nature of these reaction networks results in a large set of stiff ordinary differential equations to model them mathematically with adequate precision and accuracy. In such a scenario. where execution time of the model is expensive. the idea of going for online optimization and control of such processes seems to be a near impossible task. Catering these problems in the ongoing research. optimization using surrogate model obtained from a novel algorithm is proposed in this work as a solution.

It is an important unit operation which produces raw materials for a subsequent chemical reduction in Blast Furnace. Of the enormous amount of energy consumed by Blast Furnace. a large portion is utilized in processing the raw materials. High-quality raw materials. therefore. ensure less consumption of energy in the Blast Furnace.

1282929,An Evolutionary Neuro-Fuzzy C-means Clustering Technique,2020,Priyanka D Pantula and Srinivas S Miriyala and Kishalay Mitra,89,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,,103435,Pergamon,One of the standard approaches for data analysis in unsupervised machine learning techniques is cluster analysis or clustering. where the data possessing similar features are grouped into a certain number of clusters. Among several significant ways of performing clustering. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is a methodology. where every data point is hypothesized to be associated with all the clusters through a fuzzy membership function value. FCM is performed by minimizing an objective functional by optimally estimating the decision variables namely. the membership function values and cluster representatives. under a constrained environment. With this approach. a marginal increase in the number of data points leads to an enormous increase in the size of decision variables. This explosion. in turn. prevents the application of evolutionary optimization solvers in FCM. which thereby leads to inefficient data clustering.

We present a novel approach for data driven modelling using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for enabling surrogate assisted nonlinear feedback control of grinding circuits. leading to energy sustainability in mineral processing industries. However. there has been a criticism on RNNs as their network hyper-parameters viz.. the optimal number of hidden layers (HL). number of nodes in each HL. nature of activation function used and number of previous time instances are determined heuristically. To address this criticism. we propose a method to optimally design the RNN (by estimating the hyper-parameters) for emulating industrial grinding circuit in lead–zinc ore beneficiation process. by exploring the trade-off between the aspects of accuracy and overfitting.

Fast and efficient surrogate models such as ANN offer a credible solution to this problem. Optimization of the complex model can proceed with a data based surrogate model. thereby making it much faster than the conventional run.

Conventionally. researchers have resorted to box approach for sampling in the uncertain parameter space. mimicking the uncertain parameter realizations. to observe their effects in objective functions and constraints. In case data are scattered in the uncertain parameter space. sampling in the entire range. as done in the box approach. might lead to erroneous results. To mitigate this problem. a sampling technique to generate data points inside the admissible regions is proposed leading to accurate identification of uncertain space.

1282934,A Chance Constrained Programming Based Multi-Criteria Decision Making Under Uncertainty,2019,Priyanka D Pantula and Srinivas S Miriyala and Kishalay Mitra,,,,359-364,IEEE,Multi-criteria decision making under uncertainty is a common practice followed in industries and academia. Among several types of uncertainty handling techniques. Chance Constrained Programming (CCP) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has accessibility to distribution of the data for uncertain parameters. However. the assumption that the uncertain parameters must follow some well-behaved probability distribution is a myth for most of the practical applications. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate machine learning algorithms with CCP and thereby make it data-driven. A novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to transcript the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are identified.

In this paper. we tackle the problem of learning representations invariant to a specific factor or trait of data. The representation learning process is formulated as an adversarial minimax game. We analyze the optimal equilibrium of such a game and find that it amounts to maximizing the uncertainty of inferring the detrimental factor given the representation while maximizing the certainty of making task-specific predictions. On three benchmark tasks. namely fair and bias-free classification. language-independent generation. and lighting-independent image classification. we show that the proposed framework induces an invariant representation. and leads to better generalization evidenced by the improved performance.,True,dBu32jIAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C,127,https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11122,5672971224339713468,/scholar?cites=5672971224339713468,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.11122,0,0,0

Although there has been a considerable amount of research on modeling the distracted behavior of drivers under various conditions. accurate automatic detection using multiple modalities and especially the contribution of using the speech modality to improve accuracy has received little attention. This paper introduces a new multimodal dataset for distracted driving behavior and discusses automatic distraction detection using features from three modalities: facial expression. speech and car signals. Detailed multimodal feature analysis shows that adding more modalities monotonically increases the predictive accuracy of the model. Finally. a simple and effective multimodal fusion technique using a polynomial fusion layer shows superior distraction detection results compared to the baseline SVM and neural network models.,True,dBu32jIAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10565,6921284706323801967,/scholar?cites=6921284706323801967,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10565,0,0,0

University Transportation Center,Distracted driving has become a major cause of crashes and loss of life. While there is legislation prohibiting the use of cellphones while driving. people continue to use them. We reason that if we can create a system that automatically detects when a person is distracted and warns them (even shutting down an application if necessary). then some serious accidents could be prevented. The goal of this project was to expand on our previous work on automatically detecting driver distraction by using more modalities than simply speech. For this we needed to collect a new dataset where the car information (gas pedal. etc.) and video driver information from a good quality back-facing camera were collected.

1282939,Indexing for Time-Sensitive Prediction,,Eugene Wu and Yulun Du and Aditya Parameswaran and Leilani Battle and Edward Benson,,,,,,Online services such as ad serving or fraud detection increasingly depend on making fast predictions that meet hard latency bounds. Unfortunately. most machine learning systems select a set of features that maximize prediction accuracy. and use all of them when making predictions. while ignoring the cost of extracting those features. Since the feature extraction costs can easily dominate the total prediction latency. this approach is ill-suited to online prediction tasks. For example. a spike in user traffic that overloads CPU resources. or varying input sizes (eg. user profile histories or uploaded image size). can cause the cost (ie. time taken) of feature extraction to exceed hard response constraints. In these cases. it is desirable to pick a subset of the available features that maximizes the prediction accuracy while meeting the time constraint. We develop algorithms and indexes to support cost-sensitive prediction. ie. making model-based predictions while taking feature evaluation cost into account. Unlike prior work that integrate with a specific learning algorithm. we use a wrapper-based approach. that enable our cost-sensitive online prediction schemes to be overlaid on top of a general class of machine learning algorithms (such as standard algorithms for classification or regression). Given an item and an online computation cost (ie. time) budget. we present two approaches to return an appropriately chosen machine learning model that will run within the specified time on the given item. The first returns the optimal model. ie. one with the highest accuracy that runs within the specified time. but requires significant up-front precomputation time.
