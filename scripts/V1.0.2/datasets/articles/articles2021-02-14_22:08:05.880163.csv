1024660,Small-molecule inhibitors of protein–protein interactions: progressing towards the dream,2004,Michelle R Arkin and James A Wells,3,,4,301-317,Nature Publishing Group,Protein–protein interactions have a key role in most biological processes. and offer attractive opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Developing small molecules that modulate protein–protein interactions is difficult. owing to issues such as the lack of well-defined binding pockets. Nevertheless. there has been important progress in this endeavour in recent years. Here. we use illustrative examples to discuss general strategies for addressing the challenges inherent in the discovery and characterization of small-molecule inhibitors of protein–protein interactions.,True,uX3ZYZEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1791,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd1343,3627539224778533882,/scholar?cites=3627539224778533882,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michelle_Arkin/publication/8640012_Small-Molecule_Inhibitors_of_Protein-Protein_Interactions_Progressing_toward_the_Reality/links/09e415111388cd69f9000000/Small-Molecule-Inhibitors-of-Protein-Protein-Interactions-Progressing-toward-the-Reality.pdf,0,0,0

An oligomeric assembly was synthesized in which the donor is Ru(phen)2dppz2+ (phen. phenanthroline. and dppz. dipyridophenazine) and the acceptor is Rh(phi)2phen3+ (phi. phenanthrenequinone diimine). These metal complexes are intercalated either one or two base steps in from the helix termini. Although the ruthenium-modified oligonucleotide hybridized to an unmodified complement luminesces intensely. the ruthenium-modified oligomer hybridized to the rhodium-modified oligomer shows no detectable luminescence. Time-resolved studies point to a lower limit of 10(9) per second for the quenching rate.

In 2004. we reviewed some early successes; since then. potent inhibitors have been developed for diverse protein complexes. and compounds are now in clinical trials for six targets. Surprisingly. many of these PPI clinical candidates have efficiency metrics typical of “lead-like” or “drug-like” molecules and are orally available. Successful discovery efforts have integrated multiple disciplines and make use of all the modern tools of target-based discovery—structure. computation. screening. and biomarkers.

1024663,Rates of DNA-mediated electron transfer between metallointercalators,1996,MR Arkin and EDA Stemp and RE Holmlin and JK Barton and A Hörmann and EJC Olson and PF Barbara,273,Science,5274,475-480,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Ultrafast emission and absorption spectroscopies were used to measure the kinetics of DNA-mediated electron transfer reactions between metal complexes intercalated into DNA. In the presence of rhodium(III) acceptor. a substantial fraction of photoexcited donor exhibits fast oxidative quenching (>3 × 1010 per second). Transient-absorption experiments indicate that. for a series of donors. the majority of back electron transfer is also very fast (∼1010 per second). This rate is independent of the loading of acceptors on the helix. but is sensitive to sequence and π stacking. The cooperative binding of donor and acceptor is considered unlikely on the basis of structural models and DNA photocleavage studies of binding. These data show that the DNA double helix differs significantly from proteins as a bridge for electron transfer.On-Line References and Notes,True,uX3ZYZEAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,517,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/273/5274/475.abstract,9354470310817165385,/scholar?cites=9354470310817165385,,,0,0,0

In metazoa. distinct stress conditions activate different eIF2α kinases (PERK. PKR. GCN2. and HRI) that converge on phosphorylating a unique serine in eIF2α. This collection of signaling pathways is termed the ‘integrated stress response’ (ISR). eIF2α phosphorylation diminishes protein synthesis. while allowing preferential translation of some mRNAs. Starting with a cell-based screen for inhibitors of PERK signaling. we identified a small molecule. named ISRIB. that potently (IC50 = 5 nM) reverses the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation. ISRIB reduces the viability of cells subjected to PERK-activation by chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress. eIF2α phosphorylation is implicated in memory consolidation. Remarkably. ISRIB-treated mice display significant enhancement in spatial and fear-associated learning. Thus. memory consolidation is inherently limited by the ISR. and ISRIB releases this brake. As such. ISRIB promises to contribute to our understanding and treatment of cognitive disorders.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00498.001,True,uX3ZYZEAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC,403,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00498,4318470330107491505,/scholar?cites=4318470330107491505,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00498.pdf,0,0,0

It is an important target of adamantane-family antiviral drugs. but drug resistance has become a critical problem. Two different sites for drug interaction have been proposed. One is a lipid-facing pocket between 2 adjacent transmembrane helices (around Asp-44). at which the drug binds and inhibits proton conductance allosterically.

Among these. members of the let-7 miRNA family control many cell-fate determination genes to influence pluripotency. differentiation. and transformation. Lin28 is a specific. posttranscriptional inhibitor of let-7 biogenesis. We report crystal structures of mouse Lin28 in complex with sequences from let-7d. let-7-f1. and let-7g precursors. The two folded domains of Lin28 recognize two distinct regions of the RNA and are sufficient for inhibition of let-7 in vivo. We also show by NMR spectroscopy that the linker connecting the two folded domains is flexible. accommodating Lin28 binding to diverse let-7 family members.

Extensive studies on this family of proteins have focused so far mainly on the biochemical properties and cellular functions of individual factors.

However. the fermentation of plant material cannot be optimized endlessly; there is a time when plant fibre is totally fermented. and another when energy losses due to methanogenic bacteria become punitive. Therefore. very large herbivores would need to evolve adaptations for a comparative acceleration of ingesta passage. To our knowledge. this phenomenon has not been emphasized in the literature to date.

Examples include the variety of responses to seasonally fluctuating environments. different adaptations to heat and drought. and in particular adaptations to herbivory and various herbivore niches.

However. current scientific standards cannot be met by mere descriptions of both the characteristics of the niche and the organism. and a (hypothetical) intuitive explanation for the adaptive relevance of the latter; the presence or absence of a characteristic must be demonstrated in sound statistical terms (Hagen 2003) ideally supported by experimental data (from in vivo. in vitro. or model assays) on its adaptive relevance.,True,e3_jZdoAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,167,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72422-3_3,8526373975824529629,/scholar?cites=8526373975824529629,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/3413/5/Clauss_Grazer_Browser_Springer_2008AKZMSV.pdf,0,0,0

An important argument in physiological ecology is built on the allometries of gut fill (assumed to scale to BM1.0) and energy requirements/intake (assumed to scale to BM0.75) in mammalian herbivores. From the difference in exponents. it has been postulated that the mean retention time (MRT) of digesta should scale to BM1.0–0.75 = BM0.25. This has been used to argue that larger animals have an advantage in digestive efficiency and hence can tolerate lower-quality diets.

The mesowear score (MS) instead describes tooth wear experienced by individual animals during their lifetime. Under the assumption that the abrasiveness that causes the MS in individuals is the same abrasiveness to which species adapted by evolving hypsodonty. one would expect a close correlation between the MS and the hypsodonty index (HI).

In mammals. levels of polyamines (PAs) decrease during the ageing process; PAs are known to decrease systemic inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine synthesis in macrophages. Reductions in intestinal luminal PAs levels have been associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction. The probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis LKM512 is known to increase intestinal luminal PA concentrations.   Methodology/Principal Findings We supplemented the diet of 10-month-old Crj:CD-1 female mice with LKM512 for 11 months. while the controls received no supplementation. Survival rates were compared using Kaplan–Meier survival curves. LKM512-treated mice survived significantly longer than controls (P<0.001); moreover. skin ulcers and tumors were more common in the control mice. We then analyzed inflammatory and intestinal conditions by measuring several markers using HPLC. ELISA. reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. and histological slices. LKM512 mice showed altered 16S rRNA gene expression of several predominant intestinal bacterial groups. The fecal concentrations of PAs. but not of short-chain fatty acids. were significantly higher in LKM512-treated mice (P<0.05).

Exposure of Leydig cells to PPs prevented cholesterol transport into the mitochondria after hormonal stimulation and inhibited steroid synthesis. without altering total cell protein synthesis or mitochondrial and DNA integrity. PPs also reduced the levels of the cholesterol-binding protein peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) because of a direct transcriptional inhibition of PBR gene expression in MA-10 Leydig cells.

Male fishes downstream of some wastewater outfalls produce vitellogenin (VTG) (a protein normally synthesized by females during oocyte maturation) and early-stage eggs in their testes. and this feminization has been attributed to the presence of estrogenic substances such as natural estrogens [estrone or 17β-estradiol (E2)]. the synthetic estrogen used in birth-control pills [17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2)]. or weaker estrogen mimics such as nonylphenol in the water. Despite widespread evidence that male fishes are being feminized. it is not known whether these low-level. chronic exposures adversely impact the sustainability of wild populations.

At present. there is no reliable vaccine or antiviral drug against either virus. Using an RNA interference (RNAi) approach. we show that individual as well as joint infection by RSV and PIV can be specifically prevented and inhibited by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). instilled intranasally in the mouse. with or without transfection reagents.

1024749,MicroRNAs: processing. maturation. target recognition and regulatory functions,2011,Girish C Shukla and Jagjit Singh and Sailen Barik,3,Molecular and cellular pharmacology,3,83,NIH Public Access,The remarkable discovery of small noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) and their role in posttranscriptional gene regulation have revealed another fine-tuning step in the expression of genetic information. A large number of cellular pathways. which act in organismal development and are important in health and disease. appear to be modulated by miRNAs. At the molecular level. miRNAs restrain the production of proteins by affecting the stability of their target mRNA and/or by down-regulating their translation.

However. its efficacy on non-nuclear genes and its effect on the interferon pathway remain unexplored. Since directed mutation of RNA genomes is not possible through conventional mutagenesis. we have tested sequence-specific 21-nucleotide long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) for their ability to silence cytoplasmic RNA genomes. Short dsRNAs were generated against specific mRNAs of respiratory syncytial virus. a nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA virus with a cytoplasmic life cycle. At nanomolar concentrations. the dsRNAs specifically abrogated expression of the corresponding viral proteins. and produced the expected mutant phenotype ex vivo.

This review summarizes our knowledge of the two largest families of immunophilins. namely cyclophilin and FK506-binding protein. and a novel chimeric dual-family immunophilin. named FK506- and cyclosporin-binding protein (FCBP). The larger members of each family are modular in nature. consisting of multiple PPIase and/or protein-protein interaction domains. Despite the apparent difference in their sequence and three-dimensional structure. the three families encode similar enzymatic and biological functions.

NJ,The “megaprimer” method (1) based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the simplest and most versatile procedures of site-specific in vitro mutagenesis available to date. The method utilizes three oligonucleotide primers and two rounds of PCR performed on a DNA template containing the cloned gene that is to be mutated. The rationale of the method is shown schematically in Fig. 1 where A and B represent the “flanking” primers that can map either within the cloned gene or outside the gene (i.e.. within the vector sequence) and M represents the internal “mutant” primer containing the desired base change. The first round of PCR is performed using the mutant primer (e.g.. M1 in Fig. 1) and one of the flanking primers (e.g.. A).

Long-range effects of hedgehog (hh) signaling have been suggested to result either from local induction of a secondary diffusible signal or from the direct action of the highly diffusible carboxy-terminal product of HH autoproteolytic cleavage. Here we provide evidence that the long-range somite patterning effects of SHH are instead mediated by a direct action of the amino-terminal cleavage product. We also show that pharmacological manipulations to increase the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A can selectively antagonize the effects of the amino-terminal cleavage product.

Several MIRNA genes in the plant kingdom are ancient. with conservation extending between angiosperms and the mosses. whereas many others are more recently evolved. Here. we use deep sequencing and computational methods to identify. profile and analyze non-conserved MIRNA genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. 48 non-conserved MIRNA families. nearly all of which were represented by single genes. were identified. Sequence similarity analyses of miRNA precursor foldback arms revealed evidence for recent evolutionary origin of 16 MIRNA loci through inverted duplication events from protein-coding gene sequences. Interestingly. these recently evolved MIRNA genes have taken distinct paths. Whereas some non-conserved miRNAs interact with and regulate target transcripts from gene families that donated parental sequences. others have drifted to the point of non-interaction with parental gene family transcripts. Some young MIRNA loci clearly originated from one gene family but form miRNAs that target transcripts in another family.

Genome-wide profiles and analyses of small RNAs. particularly the large class of 24-nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). were done for wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and silencing pathway mutants with defects in three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) and four Dicer-like (DCL) genes. The profiling involved direct analysis using a multiplexed. parallel-sequencing strategy. Small RNA-generating loci. especially those producing predominantly 24-nt siRNAs. were found to be highly correlated with repetitive elements across the genome. These were found to be largely RDR2- and DCL3-dependent. although alternative DCL activities were detected on a widespread level in the absence of DCL3. In contrast. no evidence for RDR2-alternative activities was detected. Analysis of RDR2- and DCL3-dependent small RNA accumulation patterns in and around protein-coding genes revealed that upstream gene regulatory sequences systematically lack siRNA-generating activities. Further. expression profiling suggested that relatively few genes. proximal to abundant 24-nt siRNAs. are regulated directly by RDR2- and DCL3-dependent silencing.

Deformations are achieved both by forces extrinsic to the membrane as well as by structural modifications in the bilayer or at the bilayer surface that favor the acquisition of curvature. We report here that a family of proteins previously implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton also have powerful lipid bilayer-deforming properties via an N-terminal module (F-BAR) similar to the BAR domain. Several such proteins. like a subset of BAR domain proteins. bind to dynamin. a GTPase implicated in endocytosis and actin dynamics. via SH3 domains. The ability of BAR and F-BAR domain proteins to induce tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane is enhanced by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and is antagonized by dynamin.

1024843,Embryonic lethality in mice homozygous for a processing-deficient allele of Notch1,2000,Stacey S Huppert and Anh Le and Eric H Schroeter and Jeffrey S Mumm and Meera T Saxena and Laurie A Milner and Raphael Kopan,405,Nature,6789,966-970,Nature Publishing Group,The Notch genes encode single-pass transmembrane receptors that transduce the extracellular signals responsible for cell fate determination during several steps of metazoan development. The mechanism by which extracellular signals affect gene transcription and ultimately cell fate decisions is beginning to emerge for the Notch signalling pathway. One paradigm is that ligand binding to Notch triggers a Presenilin1-dependent proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular domain from the membrane 1. resulting in low amounts of Notch intracellular domain which form a nuclear complex with CBF1/Su (H)/Lag1 to activate transcription of downstream targets 2. Not all observations clearly support this processing model. and the most rigorous test of it is to block processing in vivo and then determine the ability of unprocessed Notch to signal. Here we report that the phenotypes associated with a single point mutation at …,True,RsjHopMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,384,https://www.nature.com/articles/35016111,7321228065748959668,/scholar?cites=7321228065748959668,,,0,0,0
1024844,Cell surface presenilin-1 participates in the γ-secretase-like proteolysis of Notch,1999,William J Ray and Min Yao and Jeff Mumm and Eric H Schroeter and Paul Saftig and Michael Wolfe and Dennis J Selkoe and Raphael Kopan and Alison M Goate,274,Journal of Biological Chemistry,51,36801-36807,Elsevier,Presenilin-1 (PS1). a polytopic membrane protein primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. is required for efficient proteolysis of both Notch and β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) within their trans- membrane domains. The activity that cleaves APP (called γ-secretase) has properties of an aspartyl protease. and mutation of either of the two aspartate residues located in adjacent transmembrane domains of PS1 inhibits γ-secretase processing of APP. We show here that these aspartates are required for Notch processing. since mutation of these residues prevents PS1 from inducing the γ-secretase-like proteolysis of a Notch1 derivative. Thus PS1 might function in Notch cleavage as an aspartyl protease or di-aspartyl protease cofactor. However. the ER localization of PS1 is inconsistent with that hypothesis. since Notch cleavage occurs near the cell surface. Using pulse-chase and biotinylation assays. we …,True,RsjHopMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,319,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819532343,8042683327013016319,/scholar?cites=8042683327013016319,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819532343,0,0,0
1024845,A presenilin dimer at the core of the γ-secretase enzyme: insights from parallel analysis of Notch 1 and APP proteolysis,2003,Eric H Schroeter and Ma Xenia G Ilagan and Anne L Brunkan and Silva Hecimovic and Yue-ming Li and Min Xu and Huw D Lewis and Meera T Saxena and Bart De Strooper and Archie Coonrod and Taisuke Tomita and Takeshi Iwatsubo and Chad L Moore and Alison Goate and Michael S Wolfe and Mark Shearman and Raphael Kopan,100,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,22,13075-13080,National Academy of Sciences,Notch receptors and the amyloid precursor protein are type I membrane proteins that are proteolytically cleaved within their transmembrane domains by a presenilin (PS)-dependent γ-secretase activity. In both proteins. two peptide bonds are hydrolyzed: one near the inner leaflet and the other in the middle of the transmembrane domain. Under saturating conditions the substrates compete with each other for proteolysis. but not for binding to PS. At least some Alzheimer9s disease-causing PS mutations reside in proteins possessing low catalytic activity. We demonstrate (i) that differentially tagged PS molecules coimmunoprecipitate. and (ii) that PS N-terminal fragment dimers exist by using a photoaffinity probe based on a transition state analog γ-secretase inhibitor. We propose that γ-secretase contains a PS dimer in its catalytic core. that binding of substrate is at a site separate from the active site. and that substrate …,True,RsjHopMAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,254,https://www.pnas.org/content/100/22/13075.short,16274323725794012663,/scholar?cites=16274323725794012663,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/100/22/13075.full.pdf,0,0,0
1024846,γ-Secretase inhibitors repress thymocyte development,2001,Brandon K Hadland and Nancy R Manley and Dong-ming Su and Gregory D Longmore and Chad L Moore and Michael S Wolfe and Eric H Schroeter and Raphael Kopan,98,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,13,7487-7491,National Academy of Sciences,A major therapeutic target in the search for a cure to the devastating Alzheimer9s disease is γ-secretase. This activity resides in a multiprotein enzyme complex responsible for the generation of Aβ42 peptides. precipitates of which are thought to cause the disease. γ-Secretase is also a critical component of the Notch signal transduction pathway; Notch signals regulate development and differentiation of adult self-renewing cells. This has led to the hypothesis that therapeutic inhibition of γ-secretase may interfere with Notch-related processes in adults. most alarmingly in hematopoiesis. Here. we show that application of γ-secretase inhibitors to fetal thymus organ cultures interferes with T cell development in a manner consistent with loss or reduction of Notch1 function. Progression from an immature CD4−/CD8− state to an intermediate CD4+/CD8+ double-positive state was repressed.
