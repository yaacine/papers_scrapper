Although negative refraction has been realized in microwave and infrared by using metamaterials and by using two-dimensional waveguide structures. creation of a bulk metamaterial showing negative refraction at visible frequency has not been successful. mainly because of the significant resonance losses and fabrication difficulties. We report bulk metamaterials made of nanowires that show such negative refraction for all incident angles in the visible region. Moreover. the negative refraction occurs far from any resonance. resulting in a low-loss and a broad-band propagation at visible frequencies.

This is due to the evanescent waves carrying small scale information from an object that fades away in the far field. A recently proposed superlens theory offers a new approach by surface excitation at the negative index medium. We introduce a far-field optical superlens (FSL) that is capable of imaging beyond the diffraction limit. The FSL significantly enhances the evanescent waves of an object and converts them into propagating waves that are measured in the far field.

The key element is termed as a Far-field SuperLens (FSL) which consists of a conventional superlens and a nanoscale coupler. The evanescent fields from the object are enhanced and then converted into propagating fields by the FSL. By only measuring the propagating field in the far-field. the object image can be reconstructed with subwavelength resolution. As an example of this concept. we design and fabricate a silver structured one dimensional FSL.

Both infections have been associated with pregnancy-related complications. and case detection and treatment in pregnancy is essential. In countries without laboratory support. the diagnosis and treatment of cervical infections is based on the syndromic approach. In this study we measured the prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhoea among antenatal care attendees in Botswana. We evaluated the syndromic approach for the detection of cervical infections in pregnancy. and determined if risk scores could improve the diagnostic accuracy. In a cross-sectional study. 703 antenatal care attendees in Botswana were interviewed and examined. and specimens were collected for the identification of C trachomatis. N gonorrhoeae and other reproductive tract infections. Risk scores to identify attendees with cervical infections were computed based on identified risk factors. and their sensitivities. specificities. likelihood ratios and predictive values were calculated. The prevalence of chlamydia was 8%. and gonorrhoea was found in 3% of the attendees. Symptoms and signs of vaginal discharge did not predict cervical infection. and a syndromic approach failed to identify infected women.

The problem of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms is expected to increase disproportionally and controlling of infections is becoming difficult because of the rapid spread of those micro-organisms. Primary therapy with classical antibiotics is becoming more ineffective. Combinational therapy of antibiotics with antimicrobial peptides (AMP's) has been suggested as an alternative approach to improve treatment outcome. Their unique mechanism of action and safety profile makes AMP's appealing candidates for simultaneous or sequential use in different cases of infections.

Cyclic voltammetry was used to evaluate electrode kinetics and reaction thermodynamics. The MnII/MnIII and MnIII/MnIV redox couples appeared to be quasi-reversible. A cell potential of 1.1 V was measured for the one-electron disproportionation of the neutral MnIII complex. The diffusion coefficient for manganese acetylacetonate in the supporting electrolyte solution was estimated to be in the range of 3–5 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 at room temperature. The charge–discharge characteristics of this system were evaluated in an H-type glass cell. Coulombic efficiencies increased with cycling suggesting an irreversible side reaction.

The light emitted from blends of some commonly used polymers and the fullerene molecule is significantly different from that of any of the pure materials comprising the blend. The lower energy of the blend EL is found to correlate with both the voltage onset of emission and the open-circuit voltage of the photovoltaic cell under solar illumination.

In these schemes the Reynolds stressesare obtained from an approximated set of transport equations containing only mean-field variables and second-order turbulence correlations. ie correlations of just two fluctuating quantities. The aim of this research area is to devise (in terms of the allowable correlations) sufficiently faithful imitations of the real processes affecting the transport of uiuj for the equations to provide a generally valid closure for determining the Reynolds stress.(Here ‘valid’means offering sufficient accuracy for practical purposes.) Whether this aim can be completely achieved remains an open question.

The method allows the thickness of the near-wall RANS Layer to be chosen freely. This layer is interfaced to the outer LES region subject to compatibility conditions for velocity and turbulent viscosity imposed across the interface. These conditions are extracted dynamically as the simulation progresses. In the RANS layer. one-equation (k–l) and two-equations (k–ϵ) models are used and interfaced to the dynamic Smagorinsky or one-equation subgrid-scale models.

1235127,Emplacement of dikes. sills and crustal magma chambers at divergent plate boundaries,1990,Agust Gudmundsson,176,Tectonophysics,3-4,257-275,Elsevier,A model of dike emplacement at divergent plate boundaries is developed which predicts that below the uppermost 1–3 km of the oceanic crust. the number and lengths of dikes in any particular swarm should increase. but that the thickness should decrease. with depth in the crust. These predictions are supported by field observations. It is proposed that rapid injections of dikes at divergent plate boundaries may temporarily alter the normal stress field in such a way that. at a certain level in the crust. subsequent dikes change into sills. Such sills may develop into crustal magma chambers. either when many nearby sills combine into a large one. or when an initial sill absorbs the magma of many dikes that enter it in a rapid succession while the sill is liquid. For the fastest spreading ridges the initial thickness of a sill that is to develop into a crustal chamber need only attain 20 m. whereas at the slowest spreading ridges …,True,LcTUo5kAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,236,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004019519090073H,7170652149411596818,/scholar?cites=7170652149411596818,,,,0,0,0

Most systems are 40–150 km long. 5–20 km wide. and develop a central volcano. They supply magma to all eruptions in Iceland. Data obtained in the last few years have greatly improved our knowledge of their volcanotectonic environment; as a result. the geometry of the plume is better constrained. and the crust. previously considered thin (∼10 km). is now modeled as thick (∼20–40 km). Depending on the location of the volcanic systems. their activity either decreases or increases faulting in the two main seismic zones.

In Iceland. the inclined sheets form dense swarms of (mostly) basaltic. 0.5–1 m thick sheets. dipping either at 20–50° or at 75–90° towards the central volcano to which they belong. The regional dykes are (mostly) basaltic. 4–6 m thick. subvertical. subparallel and form swarms. less dense than those of the sheets but tens of kilometres long. in the parts of the volcanic systems that are outside the central volcanoes. In both types of swarms. the intrusion intensity decreases with altitude in the lava pile. Theoretical models generally indicate very high crack-tip stresses for propagating dykes and sheets. Nevertheless. most of these intrusions become arrested at various crustal depths and never reach the surface to supply magma to volcanic eruptions.

Most magma chambers form through repeated magma injections. commonly sills. and gradually expand and change their shapes. Highly irregular magma-chamber shapes are thermo-mechanically unstable; common long-term equilibrium shapes are comparatively smooth and approximate those of ellipsoids of revolution. Some chambers. particularly small and sill-like. may be totally molten. Most chambers. however. are only partially molten. the main part of the chamber being crystal mush. a porous material.

This has led to the suggestion that the Las Cañadas caldera. one of the best exposed calderas in the world. is the result of lateral collapse. We have tested this idea using the available structural. stratigraphic. volcanological. and geochronological data. We conclude that the Las Cañadas caldera is the result of a complex sequence of vertical collapse events associated with a long history of phonolitic explosive activity in the central part of Tenerife. Our results indicate. however. that vertical collapses may have played a major role in triggering lateral collapses.

For understanding the permeability evolution and maintenance in a fault zone. its internal structure and associated local stresses and mechanical properties must be known. This follows because the permeability is primarily related to fracture propagation and their linking up into interconnected clusters in the fault zone. Here we show that a fault zone can be regarded as an elastic inclusion with mechanical properties that differ from those of the host rock. As a consequence. the fault zone modifies the associated regional stress field and develops its own local stress field which normally differs significantly. both as regard magnitude and orientation of the principal stresses. from the regional field.

In contrast. the polarisations of shear-waves at three new stations sited over the Húsavík–Flatey Fault. a major seismically-active transform fault in northern Iceland. are approximately NW to SE. orthogonal to the stress-aligned polarisations elsewhere. Modelling suggests that these 90°-flips in polarisations are caused by propagation through cracks containing fluids at high pore-fluid pressures within one or two MPa of the critical stress.

The upper part of the crust is mainly composed of lava flows. with abundant columnar joints that are mostly perpendicular to the lava contacts. The lava flows are horizontal at the surface of the rift zone but become tilted at the rate of 1° for every 150 m depth in the crust. At the surface of the rift zone the joints are vertical and parallel to the vertical principal stress. Because of tilting of the lava pile. the columnar joints become oblique to this stress. hence becoming potential shear fractures. and form echelon sets at greater depths in the crust.

1235145,Effect of tensile stress concentration around magma chambers on intrusion and extrusion frequencies,1988,Agust Gudmundsson,35,Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research,3,179-194,Elsevier,What controls the intrusion and extrusion frequencies associated with volcanoes is still poorly understood. I propose that for volcanoes at divergent plate boundaries. these frequencies may be largely determined by the tensile stress concentration around the magma chambers that feed them. This stress concentration is mainly a function of the applied tensile stress. associated with spreading. and the aspect (height/width) ratios of the chambers. High spreading rates and/or aspect ratios lead to high rates of tensile stress concentration around the chambers and to an increase in their intrusion frequencies.

1235146,How hydrofractures become arrested,2001,Agust Gudmundsson and Sonja L Brenner,13,Terra Nova,6,456-462,Blackwell Science Ltd.,Fluids in the earth's crust are commonly transported by hydrofractures. such as dykes and mineral veins. many of which become arrested at various crustal depths. Hydrofractures are commonly arrested – some showing blunt tips – at contacts between soft (low Young's modulus) and stiff (high Young's modulus) layers. For example. many dyke tips are arrested at contacts between soft pyroclastic rocks and stiff basaltic lava flows. and vein tips at contacts between soft marl and stiff limestone. Theoretical models indicate that overpressured. buoyant hydrofractures in homogeneous. isotropic host rocks should normally reach the surface. In layered host rocks. however. abrupt changes in Young's moduli. horizontal discontinuities. and layers with unusually high fracture‐perpendicular stresses encourage hydrofracture arrest. It is proposed that for layer‐parallel loading. stiff layers favour hydrofracture arrest during …,True,LcTUo5kAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,130,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3121.2001.00380.x,7267635957199325138,/scholar?cites=7267635957199325138,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51319007/j.1365-3121.2001.00380.x20170112-2455-56yifx.pdf,0,0,0

Most volcanic systems develop central volcanoes. the formation of which is still poorly understood. There is great difference in the eruption and intrusion statistics of the volcanic systems inside and outside the central volcanoes. In the central volcanoes. eruptions are frequent (typically one every several hundred years). of small volume (normally less than 0.1 km3) and fed mainly by thin (average thickness of 0.5 m). inclined sheets.

1235148,Formation and development of normal-fault calderas and the initiation of large explosive eruptions,1998,Agust Gudmundsson,60,Bulletin of Volcanology,3,160-170,Springer-Verlag, The ring fractures that form most collapse calderas are steeply inward-dipping shear fractures. i.e.. normal faults. At the surface of the volcano within which the caldera fault forms. the tensile and shear stresses that generate the normal-fault caldera must peak at a certain radial distance from the surface point above the center of the source magma chamber of the volcano. Numerical results indicate that normal-fault calderas may initiate as a result of doming of an area containing a shallow sill-like magma chamber. provided that the area of doming is much larger than the cross-sectional area of the chamber and that the internal excess pressure in the chamber is smaller than that responsible for doming. This model is supported by the observation that many caldera collapses are preceded by a long period of doming over an area much larger than that of the subsequently formed caldera.

1235149,Surface stresses associated with arrested dykes in rift zones,2003,Agust Gudmundsson,65,Bulletin of Volcanology,8,606-619,Springer-Verlag,Many theoretical models predict that arrested dykes may generate major grabens at rift-zone surfaces. Arrested dyke tips in eroded rift zones. however. are normally not associated with major grabens or normal faults that could be generated by dyke-induced stresses ahead of the tips. and normal faults and grabens tend to be less common in those parts of eroded rift zones where dykes are comparatively abundant. Similarly. there are feeder dykes. as well as dykes arrested a few metres below the surface. that do not generate faults or grabens at the surface. Here I propose that this discrepancy between theoretical models and field observations may be explained by the mechanical layering of the crust. Numerical models presented here show that abrupt changes in Young's moduli. layers with high dyke-normal compressive stresses (stress barriers). and weak. horizontal contacts have large effects on the …,True,LcTUo5kAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,126,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00445-003-0289-7,10564368529973527706,/scholar?cites=10564368529973527706,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51319021/s00445-003-0289-720170112-32756-t2u7w9.pdf,0,0,0

The short-run price and income elasticities of gasoline demand in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s have been studied extensively. However. transportation analysts have hypothesized that behavioral and structural factors over the past several decades have changed the responsiveness of US consumers to changes in gasoline prices. We compare the price and income elasticities of gasoline demand in two periods of similarly high prices from 1975 to 1980 and 2001 to 2006. The short-run price elasticities differ considerably: and range from-0.034 to-0.077 during 2001 to 2006. versus-0.21 to-0.34 for 1975 to 1980.

Given that greenhouse gases are already creating havoc with our climate and that violent conflict in unstable oil-rich nations is on the rise. will matters only get worse? Or are there hopeful signs that effective. realistic solutions can be found? Blending a concise history of cars and their impact on the world. leading transportation experts Daniel Sperling and Deborah Gordon explain how we arrived at this state. and what we can do about it. Sperling and Gordon assign blame squarely where it belongs-on the auto-industry. short-sighted government policies. and consumers. They explore such solutions as getting beyond the gas-guzzler monoculture. re-inventing cars. searching for low-carbon fuels. and more. Promising advances in both transportation technology and fuel efficiency together with shifts in traveller behaviour. they suggest. offer us a way out of our predicament. The authors conclude that the two places that have the most troublesome emissions problems--California and China--are the most likely to become world leaders on these issues.

1235165,A Short History of Carsharing in the 90's,1999,Susan A Shaheen and Daniel Sperling and Conrad Wagner,,,,,,From:A Short History of Carsharing in the 90's. Journal of World Transport Policy & Practice 5 (3). 18 - 40The vast majority of automobile trips in U.S. metropolitan regions are drive-alone car trips. In 1990. approximately 90 percent of work trips and 58 percent of nonwork trips in the United States were made by vehicles with only one occupant (United States Department of Transportation. 1995). Vehicles are unused an average of 23 hours per day. This form of transportation is expensive and consumes large amounts of land.Private vehicles are attractive. Their universal appeal is demonstrated by rapid motorization rates. even in countries with high fuel prices. good transit systems. and relatively compact land development. But the environmental. resource. and social costs of widespread car use are also high. One strategy for retaining the benefits of car use while limiting costs is to create institutions for sharing vehicles.The principle of carsharing is simple: Individuals gain the benefits of private cars without the costs and responsibilities of ownership. Instead of owning one or more vehicles. a household accesses a fleet of vehicles on an as-needed basis. Carsharing may be thought of as organized short-term car rental. Individuals gain access to vehicles by joining organizations that maintain a fleet of cars and light trucks in a network of vehicle locations. Generally. participants pay a usage fee each time they use a vehicle.,True,roV8b2sAAAAJ:eH23hyXCXa4C,123,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6p3305b0,8864427106717604142,/scholar?cites=8864427106717604142,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt6p3305b0/qt6p3305b0.pdf,0,0,0

They have failed each time because of inferior performance and high costs. In this paper. we conduct an updated and detailed evaluation of the performance. costs. environmental impacts. and recharging requirements of electric vehicles. We find that considerable progress has been made in EV battery and powertrain technology since the last surge of interest in EVs in the 1970s. If the development of high-performance batteries continues as expected. advanced electric vehicles could have an urban range of over 150 miles and acceleration comparable to that provided by internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). And if optimistic battery cost. life. and performance goals are achieved. mass-produced EVs will have lower life-cycle costs than comparable conventional gasoline vehicles. EVs will reduce …,True,roV8b2sAAAAJ:E7VqQtBCVmcC,112,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191260789900071,9665961643456163540,/scholar?cites=9665961643456163540,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt3438b4bx/qt3438b4bx.pdf,0,0,0
1235167,Refueling behavior of automobile drivers,1987,Ryuichi Kitamura and Daniel Sperling,21,Transportation Research Part A: General,3,235-245,Pergamon,This paper presents a descriptive and explanatory analysis of refueling behavior of gasoline-car drivers. The relationship between drivers' attributes and their refueling behavior is examined using the results of driver surveys conducted at several refueling outlets in northern California. The objectives of the analysis are to identify spatial and temporal characteristics of refueling behavior. and to evaluate the variations in refueling behavior across driver population segments. The results show that refueling behavior is only weakly correlated with demographic and socioeconomic descriptors of the driver. On the other hand. variables representing car ownership and utilization are strongly associated with refueling behavior.,True,roV8b2sAAAAJ:sbeIDTyQOFgC,112,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191260787900173,11835646723745200198,/scholar?cites=11835646723745200198,,,,0,0,0

Barring aggressive policy intervention or a collapse of the Chinese economy. we suggest that those forecasts are conservative. We analyze the historical vehicle growth patterns of seven of the largest vehicle producing countries at comparable times in their motorization history. We estimate vehicle growth rates for this analogous group of countries to have 13–17% per year—roughly twice the rate forecasted for China by others. Applying these higher growth rates to China results in the total vehicle fleet reaching considerably higher volumes than forecasted by others. implying far higher global oil use and carbon emissions than projected by the International Energy Agency and others.,True,roV8b2sAAAAJ:4e5Qn2KL_jwC,106,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142151100200X,862993957502992693,/scholar?cites=862993957502992693,,,,0,0,0

Our findings indicate that motor vehicles and fuels are attractive candidates for reducing GHGs in the near and medium term. Transport technologies and fuels represent about half of the GHG mitigation options that have net-positive benefits – so-called “no regrets” strategies – and about 20% of the most cost-effective options to reduce GHGs to 10% below 1990 levels by 2030.,True,roV8b2sAAAAJ:cRMvf6lLvU8C,90,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920908001533,16704810594639382579,/scholar?cites=16704810594639382579,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.539.812&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1235173,Energy efficiency. fuel economy. and policy implications,2005,Nicholas Lutsey and Daniel Sperling,1941,Transportation Research Record,1,8-17,SAGE Publications,In the past 20 years. the acceleration performance of light-duty vehicles in the United States has improved substantially while vehicles have gotten larger and heavier. Over the same period. fuel economy. measured as miles per gallon. has not improved. These data suggest that technological innovation in vehicles is not lagging but is not being used to improve vehicle fuel economy. This paper quantifies vehicle efficiency improvements in U.S. light-duty vehicles since 1975 as they relate to fuel consumption. Energy efficiency improvements have been strongly positive and relatively constant since 1975. The rapid rise in fuel economy in the late 1970s was due to a mix of efficiency improvements and downgrading of utility in the form of reduced size. power. and elimination of accessories and amenities (such as air conditioning). In contrast. since the mid-1980s. fuel economy has remained constant while the benefits …,True,roV8b2sAAAAJ:R-LXmdHK_14C,90,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0361198105194100102,1157905945687142732,/scholar?cites=1157905945687142732,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicholas_Lutsey/publication/245561706_Energy_Efficiency_Fuel_Economy_and_Policy_Implications/links/553b0d830cf29b5ee4b66867.pdf,0,0,0

However. AFV technologies have experienced relatively little success. with fossil fuels still accounting for about 95% of global transport energy use. Here. using the US as a case study. we conduct a media analysis to show how society’s attention has skipped among AFV types between 1980 and 2013. including methanol. natural gas. plug-in electric. hybrid electric. hydrogen and biofuels. Although our results provide no indication as to whether hype ultimately has a net positive or negative impact on AFV innovation. we offer several recommendations that governments can follow to move past hype to support significant AFV adoption and displace fossil fuel …,True,roV8b2sAAAAJ:oTdOBqtIf_kC,87,https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy201613,3202646456293518936,/scholar?cites=3202646456293518936,,,https://steps.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nenergy201613.pdf,0,0,0
1235175,Hydrogen hope or hype,2004,Daniel Sperling and James S Cannon,,,,235-239,Academic Press,Repeated efforts have been made to introduce alternatives to petroleum and internal combustion engines. None have thrived. Most have failed. The failure of alternative fuels is largely because of unrealistic expectations and forecasts. which in turn led to unrealistic claims. These claims were usually not intentionally deceptive. Rather they reflected a poor state of knowledge of energy and environmental phenomena and policy. This also holds true for hydrogen also. Hydrogen is unlikely to succeed on the basis of environmental and energy advantages—at least for the foreseeable future. Hydrogen is neither the easiest nor the cheapest way to gain large near and medium term societal benefits. Hybrid electric vehicles. cleaner combustion engines. and cleaner fuels will provide almost as much benefit on a per vehicle basis at a much lower cost.
