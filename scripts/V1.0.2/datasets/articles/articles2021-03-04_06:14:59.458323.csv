Human TSLP is proposed to signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex that consists of a new member of the hemopoietin family termed human TSLP receptor and the IL-7R α-chain. Cells transfected with both receptor subunits proliferated in response to purified. recombinant human TSLP. with induced phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5. Human TSLPR and IL-7Rα are principally coexpressed on monocytes and dendritic cell populations and to a much lesser extent on various lymphoid cells. In accord. we find that human TSLP functions mainly on myeloid cells; it induces the release of T cell-attracting chemokines from monocytes and. in particular. enhances the maturation of CD11c …,True,lvvcILAAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC,470,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/167/1/336.short,9134195692809403366,/scholar?cites=9134195692809403366,,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/167/1/336.full.pdf,0,0,0

The Summit will culminate efforts by the Global Tiger Initiative (GTI). launched in 2008 by Robert Zoellick. World Bank President. Leaders of 13 tiger range states. supported by international donors and conservationists attending the summit. are being asked to commit to substantive measures to prevent the unthinkable: extinction of the world’s last wild tiger populations.Wild tiger numbers are at an historic low. There is no evidence of breeding populations of tigers in Cambodia. China. Vietnam. and DPR Korea. Current approaches to tiger conservation are not slowing the decline in tiger numbers [1–3]. which has continued unabated over the last two decades. While the scale of the challenge is enormous. we submit that the complexity of effective implementation is not: commitments should shift to focus on protecting tigers at spatially well-defined priority sites. supported by proven best practices of law enforcement. wildlife management. and scientific monitoring.

SocVientiane Lao PDR https://doi. org/10.1094/PHYTO,,,,In Lao PDR. hunting of wildlife represents an important part of rural livelihoods and nutrition (Foppes et al. 1997. Clendon 2001. Krahn 2003). Lao is also one of the fastest growing tourism destinations in the world. with wildlife viewing at the top of the list for international visitors (WT0 2001. 2002). At the same time. wildlife populations are declining due to over-harvesting for subsistence and trade (Duckworth et al. 1999. Nooren and Claridge 2001). In a threat assessment of the Nam Ha National Protected Area (NPA). over-harvest of wildlife was identified by NPA staff as one of the main problems contributing to a decline in abundance of many wildlife species (Johnson 2000).To solve this problem. national regulations aim to manage wildlife for sustainable use in multi-use protected areas such that subsistence needs of enclave villages are met while also conserving viable populations of wildlife (Robichaud et al. 2001). Regulations that provide guidelines for wildlife use include the Forest Law No. 01/1996 and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) Regulation No. 0524/2001 on the Management of National Biodiversity Conservation Areas. Aquatic Animals and Wildlife (MAF 2001). MAF 0524 outlines what species can be harvested and where. identifies seasons and methods of harvest. as well as who has access to hunt in NPAs (Table 1).

An absence of reliable data on the abundance and distribution of ungulates makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of conservation efforts to recover their populations. As the principal prey for Endangered tigers Panthera tigris. depletion of wild ungulates is a major threat to the species' persistence and recovery across its range.

1192261,Design. monitoring and evaluation of a direct payments approach for an ecotourism strategy to reduce illegal hunting and trade of wildlife in Lao PDR,2018,Paul Frederick Eshoo and Arlyne Johnson and Sivilay Duangdala and Troy Hansel,13,PloS one,2,e0186133,Public Library of Science,Ecotourism as a strategy for achieving biodiversity conservation often results in limited conservation impact relative to its investment and revenue return. In cases where an ecotourism strategy has been used. projects are frequently criticized for not providing sufficient evidence on how the strategy has reduced threats or improved the status of the biodiversity it purports to protect. In Lao PDR. revenue from ecotourism has not been directly linked to or dependent on improvements in biodiversity and there is no evidence that ecotourism enterprises have contributed to conservation. In other developing countries. direct payments through explicit contracts in return for ecosystem services have been proposed as a more cost-effective means for achieving conservation. although further research is needed to evaluate the impact of this approach. To address this need. a new model was tested in the Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area (NPA) in Lao PDR using a direct payments approach to create ecotourism incentives for villagers to increase wildlife populations. Over a four-year period. we monitored along a theory of change to evaluate assumptions about the linkages between intermediate results and biological outcomes. Preliminary results show a negative correlation between ecotourism benefits and hunting infractions in target villages; no increase in hunting sign in the ecotourism sector of the NPA relative to a three-fold increase in hunting sign across the NPA’s non-tourism sectors; and an overall increase in wildlife sightings.

There are two main threats to tigers. direct killing of tigers and the illegal hunting of wild ungulates. the tigers’ principle prey. Villagers living around the National Protected Area rely on these same ungulates as an important source of protein in their daily diet. The illegal hunting of tigers and prey for commercial trade is unsustainable and is driven by a lack of ownership by local villagers who engage in illegal activities and by government agencies that do not enforce the laws. To reduce these threats the Nam Et Phou Louey National Protected Area is using a social marketing campaign in parallel with traditional enforcement to change the behavior of illegal hunters. village members. and government officials. To determine campaign effectiveness. a survey instrument was developed to measure knowledge. attitudes and behavior change. which included both a control and pre and post surveys of target audiences. The pre and post surveys indicate a significant shift along the theory of change from knowledge to behavior change.

For example. Conservation International and The Nature Conservancy are now legally registered in at least 18 and 23 developing world countries. respectively (21. 22). This provides greater accountability to national governments and donors. but also enables them to compete for funds with local NGOs. which may decrease efforts to strengthen local institutions. This can result in developing-world conservationists. with locally tuned priorities but lacking donor connections. being obliged to obtain funds from INGOs pushing global agendas. Ultimately. this can lead to INGOs edging out local institutions essential for sustaining longterm conservation (19). It also means that changes in donor or INGO priorities can lead to abrupt withdrawals of support. Conservation efforts then fail if local conservationists have not been trained. or local institutions have not been developed with their own programs and funding. Training is usually insufficiently supported: eg. only 4% of the US $3.26 billion invested in Latin American biodiversity conservation between 1990 and 1997 was specifically spent on capacity building (23). Similarly. the US Agency for International Development. a key supporter of international conservation. has cut back university scholarships in all fields for developing world students to 900 per year from a previous 20.000 (24).

Accordingly. the cranial structure in bats is unusually variable among mammals and thought to reflect specializations for feeding and echolocation. However. recent analyses of cranial structure. feeding behavior and bite force across a wide range of bats suggest that correlations between morphology and performance and/or ecology are not as clearcut as previously thought. For example. most of the variation in bite force across a wide range of phyllostomid bats was explained by differences in body size rather than specific cranial traits.

Therefore. monitoring programmes should quantify detectability for target taxa to assess whether it varies over temporal or spatial scales. We assessed the potential for tropical bat monitoring programmes to reliably estimate trends in species richness. 2. Using data from 25 bat assemblages from the Old and New World tropics. we estimated detectability for all species in an assemblage (mean proportion of species detected per sampling plot) and for individual species (species‐specific detectability). We further assessed how these estimates of detectability were affected by external sources of variation relating to time. space. survey effort and biological traits. 3. The mean proportion of species detected across 96 sampling plots was estimated at 0·76 …,True,8P6UDlAAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,93,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01976.x,8210648461620546617,/scholar?cites=8210648461620546617,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01976.x,0,0,0

However. among Old World bats a similar radiation into diverse feeding niches such as frugivory. carnivory. insectivory and nectarivory has occurred. Previous analyses of cranial shape in dietary specialists have indicated general trends in cranial shape that seemed to be correlated with differences in diet. However. up till now. a comprehensive analysis of correlations between cranial shape and diet in an explicit phylogenetic context has never been performed. Here we analyse data for 140 species of bats from 11 families. comprising most of the major radiations. Principal component analyses coupled with analyses of variance indicate several variables that seem to be informative in explaining variation among different trophic morphs. Comparative analyses. taking into account the phylogenetic relationships among the species studied. indicate that evolutionary shifts in diet among bats are indeed correlated to changes in cranial shape. Changes in cranial shape were largely in accordance with a priori predictions based on functional demands imposed by different diets. However. in contrast to our predictions. no differences were observed between bats specialising on hard versus soft prey. The absence of such differences is most likely the result of a general lack of 1) quantitative dietary information for many species and 2) the absence of data describing functional properties of food items.,True,8P6UDlAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,69,https://www.academia.edu/download/51019331/Evolutionary_Relationships_between_Crani20161222-25517-ujc2pg.pdf,5294456569642667337,/scholar?cites=5294456569642667337,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51019331/Evolutionary_Relationships_between_Crani20161222-25517-ujc2pg.pdf,0,0,0

We examined the generation of slow and fast muscle in zebrafish embryos and show that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted from the notochord can induce slow muscle from medial cells of the somite. Slow muscle derives from medial adaxial myoblasts that differentiate early. whereas fast muscle arises later from a separate myoblast pool. Mutant fish lacking shh expression fail to form slow muscle but do form fast muscle. Ectopic expression of shh.either in wild-type or mutant embryos. leads to ectopic slow muscle at the expense of fast.

While this implies a functional conservation of Cos2 and Kif7 between flies and vertebrates. the association of Kif7 with the primary cilium. an organelle absent from most Drosophila cells. suggests their mechanisms of action may have diverged. Here. using mutant alleles induced by Zinc Finger Nuclease-mediated targeted mutagenesis. we show that in zebrafish. Kif7 acts principally to suppress the activity of the Gli1 transcription factor. Notably. we find that endogenous Kif7 protein accumulates not only in the primary cilium. as previously observed in mammalian cells. but also in cytoplasmic puncta that disperse in response to Hh pathway activation. Moreover. we show that Drosophila Costal2 can substitute for Kif7. suggesting a conserved mode of action of the two proteins. We show that Kif7 interacts with both Gli1 and Gli2a and suggest that it functions to sequester Gli proteins in the cytoplasm. in a manner analogous to the regulation of Ci by Cos2 in Drosophila. We also show that zebrafish Kif7 potentiates Gli2a activity by promoting its dissociation from the Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) protein and present evidence that it mediates a Smo dependent modification of the full length form of Gli2a.

For resolution of inflammation to occur. neutrophils must die by apoptosis. allowing their recognition and removal by macrophages. The molecular events controlling this important regulatory step are poorly understood. in large part due to the genetic intractability of the human neutrophil granulocyte. The authors have established a model of inflammation in the Zebrafish. which shares many features of the innate immune system with those of humans.

KLF2 maintains a healthy. quiescent endothelial phenotype. Previous studies report a range of phenotypes following morpholino antisense oligonucleotide-induced klf2a knockdown in zebrafish. Targeted genome editing is an increasingly applied method for functional assessment of candidate genes. We therefore generated a stable klf2a mutant zebrafish and characterised its cardiovascular and haematopoietic development.   Methods and Results Using Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALEN) we generated a klf2a mutant (klf2ash317) with a 14bp deletion leading to a premature stop codon in exon 2. Western blotting confirmed loss of wild type Klf2a protein and the presence of a truncated protein in klf2ash317 mutants. Homozygous klf2ash317 mutants exhibit no defects in vascular patterning. survive to adulthood and are fertile. without displaying previously described morphant phenotypes such as high-output cardiac failure. reduced haematopoetic stem cell (HSC) development or impaired formation of the 5th accessory aortic arch. Homozygous klf2ash317 mutation did not reduce angiogenesis in zebrafish with homozygous mutations in von Hippel Lindau (vhl). a form of angiogenesis that is dependent on blood flow. We examined expression of three klf family members in wildtype and klf2ash317 zebrafish.

In zebrafish. loss of function of the transcription factor Prdm1a results in a slow to fast-twitch fiber type transformation presaged by ectopic expression of sox6 in slow-twitch progenitors. Morpholino-mediated Sox6 knockdown can suppress this transformation but causes ectopic expression of only one of three slow-twitch specific genes assayed. Here. we use gain and loss of function analysis to analyse further the role of Sox6 in zebrafish muscle fiber type specification. The GAL4 binary misexpression system was used to express Sox6 ectopically in zebrafish embryos. Cis-regulatory elements were characterized using transgenic fish.

While this implies a functional conservation of Cos2 and Kif7 between flies and vertebrates. the association of Kif7 with the primary cilium. an organelle absent from most Drosophila cells. suggests their mechanisms of action may have diverged. Here. using mutant alleles induced by Zinc Finger Nuclease-mediated targeted mutagenesis. we show that in zebrafish. Kif7 acts principally to suppress the activity of the Gli1 transcription factor. Notably. we find that endogenous Kif7 protein accumulates not only in the primary cilium. as previously observed in mammalian cells. but also in cytoplasmic puncta that disperse in response to Hh pathway activation. Moreover. we show that Drosophila Costal2 can substitute for Kif7. suggesting a conserved mode of action of the two proteins. We show that Kif7 interacts with both Gli1 and Gli2a and suggest that it functions to sequester Gli proteins in the cytoplasm. in a manner analogous to the regulation of Ci by Cos2 in Drosophila. We also show that zebrafish Kif7 potentiates Gli2a activity by promoting its dissociation from the Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) protein and present evidence that it mediates a Smo dependent modification of the full length form of Gli2a. Surprisingly. the function of Kif7 in the zebrafish embryo appears restricted principally to mesodermal derivatives. its inactivation having little effect on neural tube patterning. even when Sufu protein levels are depleted.

Zebrafish embryos lacking all Grk2 activity are refractory to both Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and oncogenic Smoothened (Smo) activity. but remain responsive to inhibition of cAMP‐dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity. Mutation of the kinase domain abrogates the rescuing activity of grk2 mRNA. suggesting that Grk2 acts in a kinase‐dependent manner to regulate the response to Hh.

The dimorphic fungus Candida albicans uses Cdc28/Hgc1. a CDK/cyclin complex. to promote persistent actin polarization for hyphal growth. Here. we report that Rga2. a GTPase‐activating protein (GAP) of the central polarity regulator Cdc42. undergoes Hgc1‐dependent hyperphosphorylation. Using the analog‐sensitive Cdc28as mutant. we confirmed that Cdc28 controls Rga2 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Deleting RGA2 produced elongated yeast cells without apparent effect on hyphal morphogenesis. However. deleting it or inactivating its GAP activity restored hyphal growth in hgc1Δ mutants. suggesting that Rga2 represses hyphal development and Cdc28/Hgc1 inactivates it upon hyphal induction.

Positive identification through radiographic comparison of antemortem and postmortem cranial suture patterns was evaluated in light of these criteria. The technique is based on reliable principles. but problems with terminology and the resolution of radiographs make SekharanÂ's method difficult to apply. Using the location. length. and slope of a sutureÂ's component lines. rather than SekharanÂ's descriptions of sutural configurations. it is possible to determine the probability of a particular suture pattern occurring in more than one individual.

In contrast to cranial neural crest. trunk neural crest of amniotes generates only non-ectomesenchymal cell types.

It is continually renewed. with dead corneocytes shed from the surface and replaced from a basal keratinocyte stem cell population. Whilst mouse is the prime model system used for epidermal studies. there is increasing employment of the zebrafish to analyse epidermis development and homeostasis. however the architecture and ontogeny of the epidermis in this system are incompletely described. In particular. it is unclear if adult zebrafish epidermis is derived entirely from the basal epidermal stem cell layer. as in the mouse. or if the most superficial keratinocyte layer is a remnant of the embryonic periderm. Furthermore. a relative paucity of cellular markers and genetic reagents to label and manipulate the basal epidermal stem cell compartment has hampered research. Here we show that the type I keratin. krtt1c19e. is a suitable marker of the basal epidermal layer and identify a krtt1c19e promoter fragment able to drive strong and specific expression in this cell type. Use of this promoter to express an inducible Cre recombinase allowed permanent labelling of basal cells during embryogenesis. and demonstrated that these cells do indeed generate keratinocytes of all strata in the adult epidermis. Further deployment of the Cre-Lox system highlighted the transient nature of the embryonic periderm. We thus show that the epidermis of adult zebrafish. as in the mouse. derives from basal stem cells. further expanding the similarities of epidermal ontogeny across vertebrates.

In cranial regions. neural crest cells are thought to differentiate into chondrocytes. osteocytes. pericytes and stromal cells. which are collectively termed ectomesenchyme derivatives. as well as pigment and neuronal derivatives. There is still no consensus as to whether the neural crest can be classified as a homogenous multipotent population of cells. This unresolved controversy has important implications for the formation of ectomesenchyme and for confirmation of whether the neural fold is compartmentalized into distinct domains. each with a different repertoire of derivatives.

While this implies a functional conservation of Cos2 and Kif7 between flies and vertebrates. the association of Kif7 with the primary cilium. an organelle absent from most Drosophila cells. suggests their mechanisms of action may have diverged. Here. using mutant alleles induced by Zinc Finger Nuclease-mediated targeted mutagenesis. we show that in zebrafish. Kif7 acts principally to suppress the activity of the Gli1 transcription factor. Notably. we find that endogenous Kif7 protein accumulates not only in the primary cilium. as previously observed in mammalian cells. but also in cytoplasmic puncta that disperse in response to Hh pathway activation. Moreover. we show that Drosophila Costal2 can substitute for Kif7. suggesting a conserved mode of action of the two proteins. We show that Kif7 interacts with both Gli1 and Gli2a and suggest that it functions to sequester Gli proteins in the cytoplasm. in a manner analogous to the regulation of Ci by Cos2 in Drosophila. We also show that zebrafish Kif7 potentiates Gli2a activity by promoting its dissociation from the Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) protein and present evidence that it mediates a Smo dependent modification of the full length form of Gli2a. Surprisingly. the function of Kif7 in the zebrafish embryo appears restricted principally to mesodermal derivatives. its inactivation having little effect on neural tube patterning. even when Sufu protein levels are depleted.

Zebrafish embryos lacking all Grk2 activity are refractory to both Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and oncogenic Smoothened (Smo) activity. but remain responsive to inhibition of cAMP‐dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity. Mutation of the kinase domain abrogates the rescuing activity of grk2 mRNA. suggesting that Grk2 acts in a kinase‐dependent manner to regulate the response to Hh.

Current therapeutic regimens. however. have been ineffective in the cure of metastatic cancer. thus an urgent need exists to revisit existing protocols and to improve the efficacy of newly developed therapeutics. Strategies based on preventing EMT could potentially contribute to improving the outcome of advanced stage cancers. To achieve this goal new assays are needed to identify targeted drugs capable of interfering with EMT or to revert the mesenchymal-like phenotype of carcinoma to an epithelial-like state. Current assays are limited to examining the dispersion of carcinoma cells in isolation in conventional 2-dimensional (2D) microwell systems. an approach that fails to account for the 3-dimensional …,True,kzusPvsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,146,https://academic.oup.com/ib/article-abstract/5/2/381/5204176,10007555846256635606,/scholar?cites=10007555846256635606,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4039387/,0,0,0

How cells control such phase transitions is. however. unknown. Here we show that RAB5A. a key endocytic protein. is sufficient to induce large-scale. coordinated motility over tens of cells. and ballistic motion in otherwise kinetically arrested monolayers. This is linked to increased traction forces and to the extension of cell protrusions. which align with local velocity. Molecularly. impairing endocytosis. macropinocytosis or increasing fluid efflux abrogates RAB5A-induced collective motility. A simple model based on mechanical junctional tension and an active cell reorientation mechanism for the velocity of self-propelled cells identifies regimes of monolayer dynamics that explain endocytic reawakening of locomotion in terms of a combination of large-scale directed migration and local unjamming.

This migration mode is a hallmark of tissue morphogenesis during development and repair and of solid tumor dissemination [1]. In addition to circulating as solitary cells. lymphoid malignancies can assemble into tissues as multicellular aggregates [3]. Whether malignant lymphocytes are capable of coordinating their motility in the context of chemokine gradients is. however. unknown. Here. we show that. upon exposure to CCL19 or CXCL12 gradients. malignant B and T lymphocytes assemble into clusters that migrate directionally and display a wider chemotactic sensitivity than individual cells. Physical modeling recapitulates cluster motility statistics and shows that intracluster cell cohesion results in noise reduction and enhanced directionality.

Local modification in the actomyosin cytoskeleton mediates spatial segregation of partitioning-defective (PAR) proteins at the cortex 1. 2. 3. but how mechanical changes in the cytoskeleton are transmitted to PAR proteins remains elusive. Here we uncover a role of actomyosin contractility in the remodelling of PAR proteins through cortical clustering. During embryonic polarization in Caenorhabditis elegans. actomyosin contractility and the resultant cortical tension stimulate clustering of PAR-3 at the cortex. Clustering of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is supported by PAR-3 clusters and is antagonized by activation of CDC-42. Cortical clustering is associated with retardation of PAR protein exchange at the cortex and with effective entrainment of advective cortical flows.

It is often crucial to identify single neurons in neuronal networks. or separate vessel tree structures in retinal blood vessel networks. in applications such as drug screening for neurological disorders or computer-aided diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Both tasks are challenging as the same bottleneck issue of filament crossovers is commonly encountered. which essentially hinders the ability of existing systems to conduct large-scale drug screening or practical clinical usage. To address the filament crossovers' problem. a two-step graph-theoretical approach is proposed in this paper. The first step focuses on segmenting filamentary pixels out of the background. This produces a filament segmentation map used as input for the second step. where they are further separated into disjointed filaments.

This increased proliferation correlated with increased YAP activation. implicating α-catenin in the Hippo/YAP pathway.

While this implies a functional conservation of Cos2 and Kif7 between flies and vertebrates. the association of Kif7 with the primary cilium. an organelle absent from most Drosophila cells. suggests their mechanisms of action may have diverged. Here. using mutant alleles induced by Zinc Finger Nuclease-mediated targeted mutagenesis. we show that in zebrafish. Kif7 acts principally to suppress the activity of the Gli1 transcription factor. Notably. we find that endogenous Kif7 protein accumulates not only in the primary cilium. as previously observed in mammalian cells. but also in cytoplasmic puncta that disperse in response to Hh pathway activation. Moreover. we show that Drosophila Costal2 can substitute for Kif7. suggesting a conserved mode of action of the two proteins. We show that Kif7 interacts with both Gli1 and Gli2a and suggest that it functions to sequester Gli proteins in the cytoplasm. in a manner analogous to the regulation of Ci by Cos2 in Drosophila. We also show that zebrafish Kif7 potentiates Gli2a activity by promoting its dissociation from the Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) protein and present evidence that it mediates a Smo dependent modification of the full length form of Gli2a. Surprisingly. the function of Kif7 in the zebrafish embryo appears restricted principally to mesodermal derivatives. its inactivation having little effect on neural tube patterning. even when Sufu protein levels are depleted.

Yet. cells in vivo usually display meandering trajectories with relatively low directional persistence. and the control and function of directional persistence during cell migration in three-dimensional environments are poorly understood. Here. we use mesendoderm progenitors migrating during zebrafish gastrulation as a model system to investigate the control of directional persistence during migration in vivo. We show that progenitor cells alternate persistent run phases with tumble phases that result in cell reorientation. Runs are characterized by the formation of directed actin-rich protrusions and tumbles by enhanced blebbing. Increasing the proportion of actin-rich protrusions or blebs leads to longer or shorter run phases. respectively. Importantly. both reducing and increasing run phases result in larger spatial dispersion of the cells. indicative of reduced migration precision. A physical model quantitatively recapitulating the migratory behavior of mesendoderm progenitors indicates that the ratio of tumbling to run times. and thus the specific degree of directional persistence of migration. are critical for optimizing migration precision. Together. our experiments and model provide mechanistic insight into the control of migration directionality for cells moving in three-dimensional environments that combine different protrusion types. whereby the proportion of blebs to actin-rich protrusions determines the directional persistence and precision of movement by regulating the ratio of tumbling to run times.,True,kzusPvsAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,32,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-016-0294-x,10345406494169884101,/scholar?cites=10345406494169884101,,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-016-0294-x,0,0,0
1192416,Ectodermal influx and cell hypertrophy provide early growth for all murine mammary rudiments. and are differentially regulated among them by Gli3,2011,May Yin Lee and Victor Racine and Peter Jagadpramana and Li Sun and Weimiao Yu and Tiehua Du and Bradley Spencer-Dene and Nicole Rubin and Lendy Le and Delphine Ndiaye and Saverio Bellusci and Klaus Kratochwil and Jacqueline M Veltmaat,6,PLoS One,10,e26242,Public Library of Science,Mammary gland development starts in utero with one or several pairs of mammary rudiments (MRs) budding from the surface ectodermal component of the mammalian embryonic skin. Mice develop five pairs. numbered MR1 to MR5 from pectoral to inguinal position. We have previously shown that Gli3Xt-J/Xt-J mutant embryos. which lack the transcription factor Gli3. do not form MR3 and MR5. We show here that two days after the MRs emerge. Gli3Xt-J/Xt-J MR1 is 20% smaller. and Gli3Xt-J/Xt-J MR2 and MR4 are 50% smaller than their wild type (wt) counterparts. Moreover. while wt MRs sink into the underlying dermis. Gli3Xt-J/Xt-J MR4 and MR2 protrude outwardly. to different extents. To understand why each of these five pairs of functionally identical organs has its own. distinct response to the absence of Gli3. we determined which cellular mechanisms regulate growth of the individual MRs. and whether and how Gli3 regulates these mechanisms. We found a 5.5 to 10.7-fold lower cell proliferation rate in wt MRs compared to their adjacent surface ectoderm. indicating that MRs do not emerge or grow via locally enhanced cell proliferation. Cell-tracing experiments showed that surface ectodermal cells are recruited toward the positions where MRs emerge. and contribute to MR growth during at least two days. During the second day of MR development. peripheral cells within the MRs undergo hypertrophy. which also contributes to MR growth. Limited apoptotic cell death counterbalances MR growth.

However. the standard of care requires inconvenient monthly intravitreal injections. This underlies an unmet clinical need to develop alternative solutions for sustained delivery of biologics. In this paper. we demonstrated that anti-VEGFs can be encapsulated by a simple mild process into our polyurethane thermogel depots. By changing the hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance in the copolymer. anti-VEGF release rates can be modulated. The antibody in the thermogel partitions into protein domains which vary in size corresponding to the hydrophilicity balance of the polymer.

Guided by our experiments on the motion of two-dimensional clusters in vitro. we developed an agent-based model in which the cells form a cohesive cluster due to attractive and alignment interactions. We find that when cells at the cluster rim are more motile. all three phases of motion coexist. in agreement with our observations. Using the model. we show that the transitions between different phases are driven by competition between an ordered rim and a disordered core accompanied by the creation and annihilation of topological defects in the velocity field.

They have been implicated in Wnt and Tgfβ signaling and serve as a nodal point in regulating many cellular activities. Dact genes have so far only been identified in bony vertebrates. Also. the number of Dact genes in a given species. the number and roles of protein motifs and functional domains. and the overlap of gene expression domains are all not clear. To address these problems. we have taken an evolutionary approach. screening for Dact genes in the animal kingdom and establishing their phylogeny and the synteny of Dact loci. Furthermore. we performed a deep analysis of the various Dact protein motifs and compared the expression patterns of different Dacts. Our study identified previously not recognized dact genes and showed that they evolved late in the deuterostome lineage. In gnathostomes. four Dact genes were generated by the two rounds of whole genome duplication in the vertebrate ancestor. with Dact1/3 and Dact2/4. respectively. arising from the two genes generated during the first genome duplication. In actinopterygians. a further dact4r gene arose from retrotranscription. The third genome duplication in the teleost ancestor. and subsequent gene loss in most gnathostome lineages left extant species with a subset of Dact genes. The distribution of functional domains suggests that the ancestral Dact function lied with Wnt signaling. and a role in Tgfβ signaling may have emerged with the Dact2/4 ancestor.

The transcription factor Pax7 marks satellite cells and is critical for establishing the adult satellite cell pool.

Evidence is emerging that although closely related. these signaling molecules have discrete functions during development. maintenance and activation of peripheral T cells. For example. during thymopoiesis Lck is uniquely able to provide all the signals required for pre‐TCRβ selection. although Fyn can substitute for a subset of these. Positive selection of CD4 single‐positive (SP) cells is also critically dependent on the expression of Lck but not Fyn. while differentiation of CD8 SP cells proceeds relatively efficiently in the absence of Lck.

We identified phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC)-γ as a partner of the Spry1 and Spry2 proteins. Spry–PLCγ interaction was dependent on the Src homology 2 domain of PLCγ and a conserved N-terminal tyrosine residue in Spry1 and Spry2. Overexpression of Spry1 and Spry2 was associated with decreased PLCγ phosphorylation and decreased PLCγ activity as measured by production of inositol (1.4.5)-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. whereas cells deficient for Spry1 or Spry1. -2. and -4 showed increased production of IP3 at baseline and further increased in response to growth factor signals.

We have little understanding of the disruptions in the developmental programme that underpin brain defects associated with this syndrome. Using mouse models. we show that Chd7 haploinsufficiency results in reduced Fgf8 expression in the isthmus organiser (IsO). an embryonic signalling centre that directs early cerebellar development. Consistent with this observation. Chd7 and Fgf8 loss-of-function alleles interact during cerebellar development. CHD7 associates with Otx2 and Gbx2 regulatory elements and altered expression of these homeobox genes implicates CHD7 in the maintenance of cerebellar identity during embryogenesis. Finally. we report cerebellar vermis hypoplasia in 35% of CHARGE syndrome patients with a proven CHD7 mutation. These observations provide key insights into the molecular aetiology of cerebellar defects in CHARGE syndrome and link reduced FGF signalling to cerebellar vermis hypoplasia in a human syndrome.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01305.001,True,p9n8qJUAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,53,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01305,12571936686484705971,/scholar?cites=12571936686484705971,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01305.pdf,0,0,0

C. canephora and C. eugenioides. C. arabica has lower genetic diversity and results in a higher quality beverage than C. canephora. Research initiatives have been launched to produce genomic and transcriptomic data about Coffea spp. as a strategy to improve breeding efficiency. Assembling the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of C. arabica and C. canephora produced by the Brazilian Coffee Genome Project and the Nestlé-Cornell Consortium revealed 32.007 clusters of C. arabica and 16.665 clusters of C. canephora.

HMP) that take a stereotype path rostrally along the pharynx and are thought to reach their target sites via active migration. Yet. this projection pattern emerged in jawless vertebrates before the evolution of migratory muscle precursors. This suggests that a so far elusive. more basic transport mechanism must have existed and may still be traceable today.Here we show for the first time that all occipital tissues participate in well-conserved cell movements.

Taking advantage of the well-established and very useful testis xenograft technique. in the present study. testis tissue and testis cell suspensions from immature collared peccaries (nZ4; 3 months old) were xenografted in SCID mice (nZ48) and evaluated at 2. 4. 6. and 8 months after grafting. Complete spermatogenesis was observed at 6 and 8 months after testis tissue xenografting.

Currently. the in vitro manipulation and culture of these cells is still in its infancy. yet muscle stem cells may be the most promising route towards the therapy of muscle diseases such as muscular dystrophies. It is often overlooked that muscular dystrophies affect head and body skeletal muscle differently. Moreover. these muscles develop differently. Specifically. head muscle and its stem cells develop from the non-somitic head mesoderm which also has cardiac competence. To which extent head muscle stem cells retain properties of the early head mesoderm and might even be able to switch between a skeletal muscle and cardiac fate is not known. This is due to the fact that the timing and mechanisms underlying head muscle stem cell development are still obscure. Consequently. it is not clear at which time point one should compare the properties of head mesodermal cells and head muscle stem cells. To shed light on this. we traced the emergence of head muscle stem cells in the key vertebrate models for myogenesis. chicken. mouse. frog and zebrafish. using Pax7 as key marker. Our study reveals a common theme of head muscle stem cell development that is quite different from the trunk. Unlike trunk muscle stem cells. head muscle stem cells do not have a previous history of Pax7 expression. instead Pax7 expression emerges de-novo. The cells develop late. and well after the head mesoderm has committed to myogenesis.

Both insulin and glucose oxidase are coencapsulated within coacervate microdroplets. The glucose oxidase quickly responds to increasing glucose levels to generate a local acidic environment. thereby rapidly triggering the dissociation of pH-sensitive coacervates to release the insulin cargo. The rate of insulin release is dependent on the glucose level. increases under hyperglycemic conditions. and decreases under normoglycemic conditions.

We describe here the cloning and characterization of Runx1. Runx2. Runx3 and Runxb genes in the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii). a member of Chondrichthyes. the oldest living group of jawed vertebrates. Through the use of alternative promoters and/or alternative splicing. each of the elephant shark Runx genes expresses multiple isoforms similar to their orthologs in human and other bony vertebrates. The expression profiles of elephant shark Runx genes are similar to those of mammalian Runx genes. The syntenic blocks of genes at the elephant shark Runx gene loci are highly conserved in human. but represented by shorter conserved blocks in zebrafish indicating a higher degree of rearrangements in this teleost fish. Analysis of promoter regions revealed conservation of binding sites for transcription factors. including two tandem binding sites for Runx that are totally conserved in the distal promoter regions of elephant shark Runx1-3. Several conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). which are putative cis-regulatory elements. and miRNA binding sites were identified in the elephant shark and human Runx gene loci. Some of these CNEs and miRNA binding sites are absent in teleost fishes such as zebrafish and fugu.

Ryll et al.(2014) have now proposed an alternative possibility that SCPP genes were present in the gnathostome stem group and were secondarily lost in chondrichthyans. We agree that. based on our data. this alternative scenario cannot be ruled out.Ryll et al.’s (2014) proposition is based mainly on the observation that the structure and histological appearance of dermal bone in fossil placoderms and extant osteichthyans are similar. suggesting a conserved molecular pathway underlying its formation in the two lineages. In our paper. we had noted that stem gnathostomes possessed dermal as well as perichondral bone and had “speculated” that “one or more SCPP‐related genes. probably Sparc. Sparcl1 or both. mediated the mineralization of skeleton in these vertebrates.” As stated. this was a speculation. and it does not exclude the possibility that. in addition to the two genes mentioned as examples. other SCPP‐related genes may have existed. Indeed. Sparcl1. either in its present form or in an ancestral form. is a potential candidate; it is absent from lampreys (Kawasaki et al. 2007; Mehta et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2013) which lack mineralized tissues. but is present in chondrichthyans and osteichthyans that possess mineralized tissues.

A wide range of macromolecules can be quickly recruited within the microdroplets. from small peptides to enzymes as large as 430 kDa to mRNAs. The therapeutic-loaded coacervates bypass endocytosis to directly enter in the cytosol. where they undergo glutathione-mediated release of payload whose bioactivity is retained in the cell. whereas mRNAs exhibit a high transfection e ciency.

1192654,Biomimetic coacervates for drug delivery,,Zhi Wei Lim,,,,,,Biomimetics has provided inspirations to design innovative materials and advanced technologies. The squid beak of Dosidicus gigas. commonly known as Humboldt squid is a fascinating instance. being a “biotool” with remarkable gradient stiffness. yet fully organic and non-mineralised. The four main components of the squid beak are chitin. pigments. water. and proteins. There are two families of proteins within the squid beak. chitin binding beak proteins (DgCBPs) and histidine-rich beak proteins (DgHBPs). DgHBPs have been demonstrated to undergo coacervation. Among the tested recombinant DgHBPs and biomimetic peptides. DgHBP-2 peptide was found to be most suitable as an encapsulation material. due to its ability to coacervate under physiological conditions. its pH and temperature responsive coacervation. With the aim of exploring DgHBP-2 peptide coacervates as drug delivery systems. characterisation of the coacervates was first done to understand its properties and limitations. Different crosslinking methods were also developed with the aim of stabilising these coacervates.The next study attempts to incorporate DgHBP-2 peptide coacervates into Glucose Responsive Insulin Delivery System (GRIDS). In this GRIDS. Glucose oxidase (GOx) and insulin were both loaded into DgHBP-2 peptide coacervates. GOx functions as a glucose sensor while the coacervates acted as an insulin reservoir. GOx hydrolyses glucose into gluconic acid. bringing about a localised acidic microenvironment that causes the disassembly of coacervates and release of insulin. The encapsulation efficiency of insulin by DgHBP-2 peptide coacervates was …,True,IMxcuY4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10356/137527/2/Lim%20Zhi%20Wei%20Thesis.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

Mutations in CFTR cause cystic fibrosis 8–10 partly through loss of cAMP-regulated Cl− permeability from the plasma membrane of affected epithelia 11. 12. The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis is deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (CFTRΔF508)(ref. 10). Studies on the biosynthesis 13. 14 and localization 15 of CFTRΔF508 indicate that the mutant protein is not processed correctly and. as a result. is not delivered to the plasma membrane. These conclusions are consistent with earlier functional studies which failed to detect cAMP-stimnlated Cl− channels in cells expressing CFTRΔF508 (refs 16. 17).

Mutation of the lysines at positions 95 or 335 to acidic amino acids converted the selectivity sequence to iodide greater than bromide greater than chloride greater than fluoride.

In order to evaluate its function. CFTR was expressed in HeLa. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO). and NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. and anion permeability was assessed with a fluorescence microscopic assay and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Adenosine 39.59-monophosphate (cAMP) increased anion permeability and chloride currents in cells expressing CFTR. but not in cells expressing a mutant CFTR (delta F508) or in nontransfected cells.

Once phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). channels required cytosolic ATP to open. Activation occurred by a PKA-independent mechanism.

Several hydrolyzable nucleotides (ATP > GTP > ITP ≈ UTP > CTP) reversibly activated phosphorylated channels. but nonhydrolyzable analogs and Mg2+-free ATP did not. Studies of CFTR mutants indicated that ATP controls channel activity independent of the R domain and suggested that hydrolysis of ATP by NBD1 may be sufficient for channel opening.

CF epithelia fail to secrete Cl-. In contrast. Ca(2+)-stimulated Cl- secretion is intact in CF airway epithelia and thus has the potential to bypass the CF Cl- secretory defect. For a Cl- channel to govern Cl- secretion. it must be located in the apical membrane. To specifically investigate apical membrane Cl- channels. we studied cells grown on permeable filter supports and measured Cl- currents across the apical membrane. We found that Ca2+ and cAMP activate different Cl- channels in the apical membrane. (i) Ca(2+)-activated Cl- channels were present in the apical membrane of airway but not in intestinal epithelia.

Carboxyl groups are activated with Woodward's reagent K (N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium 3'-sulfonate). and the adducts are reduced with [3H]BH4. The method has been applied to the anion transport protein of the human red blood cell (band 3). Woodward's reagent K is a reasonably potent inhibitor of band 3-mediated anion transport; a 5-min exposure of intact cells to 2 mM reagent at pH 6.5 produces 80% inhibition of transport. The inhibition is a consequence of modification of residues that can be protected by 4.4'-dinitrostilbene-2.2'-disulfonate.

In organs with a high metabolic demand such as the central nervous system. the continued use of mitochondria with damaged DNA and impaired metabolic enzyme function may generate additional ROS which will cause persistent activation of the innate immune system leading to more ROS production. Such a mechanism would self-sustain and possibly progressively worsen. The mitochondrial dysfunction and altered redox signal transduction pathways found in autism would conspire to activate both astroglia and microglia. These activated cells can then initiate a broad-spectrum proinflammatory gene response. Beyond the direct effects of ROS on neuronal function. receptors on neurons that bind the inflammatory mediators may serve to inhibit neuronal signaling to protect them from excitotoxic damage during various pathologic insults (eg. infection).

One form of experimentally observed long-term synaptic plasticity. which we call spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). depends on the relative timing of pre-and postsynaptic action potentials. In modeling studies. we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials.

By introducing a barrage of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that mimics conditions encountered in vivo into pyramidal neurons in slices of rat somatosensory cortex. we show that the gain of a neuronal response to excitatory drive can be modulated by varying the level of “background” synaptic input. Simultaneously increasing both excitatory and inhibitory background firing rates in a balanced manner results in a divisive gain modulation of the neuronal response without appreciable signal-independent increases in firing rate or spike-train variability.

We have developed a method of quantitatively characterizing short-term plasticity at cortical synapses that permits prediction of responses to arbitrary patterns of stimulation. Synaptic responses were recorded intracellularly as EPSCs and extracellularly as local field potentials in layer 2/3 of rat primary visual cortical slices during stimulation of layer 4 with trains of electrical stimuli containing random mixtures of frequencies. Responses exhibited complex dynamics that were well described by a simple three-component model consisting of facilitation and two forms of depression. a stronger form that decayed exponentially with a time …,True,ca_O-WQAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,589,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/17/20/7926.short,2709003976388254655,/scholar?cites=2709003976388254655,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/17/20/7926.full.pdf,0,0,0

We examine and compare several methods that allow the coded vector to be reconstructed from measured firing rates. In cases where the neuronal tuning curves resemble cosines. linear reconstruction methods work as well as more complex statistical methods requiring more detailed information about the responses of the coding neurons.

Each of the 21 MB output neuron (MBON) types elaborates segregated dendritic arbors along the parallel axons of ∼2000 Kenyon cells. forming 15 compartments that collectively tile the MB lobes. MBON axons project to five discrete neuropils outside of the MB and three MBON types form a feedforward network in the lobes. Each of the 20 dopaminergic neuron (DAN) types projects axons to one. or at most two. of the MBON compartments. Convergence of DAN axons on compartmentalized Kenyon cell–MBON synapses creates a highly ordered unit that can support learning to impose valence on sensory representations.

Lapicque developed a neuron model that is still widely used today [3. 7]. This remarkable achievement stresses that. in neural modeling. studies of function do not necessarily require an understanding of mechanism. Significant progress is possible if a phenomenon is adequately described. even if its biophysical basis cannot be modeled. Lapicque modeled the neuron using an electric circuit consisting of a parallel capacitor and resistor (Fig. 1A). These represent the capacitance and leakage resistance of the cell membrane. Of course. such a simple circuit cannot generate action potentials. but Lapicque postulated that when the membrane capacitor was charged to certain threshold potential. an action potential would be generated and the capacitor would discharge. resetting the membrane potential (Fig. 1B). Lapicque used the model to compute the firing frequency of a nerve fiber resistively coupled to a stimulating electrode held at fixed voltage. Fig. 1C presents an analogous simulation showing the response of the model to a time-varying injected current. Due to the work of Hodgkin and Huxley [2]. we can now construct models that include the dynamics of the voltage-dependent membrane conductances responsible for action potential generation. Nevertheless. for many modeling purposes. the simple model of Lapicque is adequate and extremely useful.As interpreted today. integrate-and-fire models are not restricted to the linear membrane properties of a simple capacitorresistor circuit.

In model studies. such spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) introduces the desirable features of competition among synapses and regulation of postsynaptic firing characteristics. STDP strengthens synapses that receive correlated input. which can lead to the formation of stimulus-selective columns and the development. refinement. and maintenance of selectivity maps in network models. The temporal asymmetry of STDP suppresses strong destabilizing self-excitatory loops and allows a group of neurons that become selective early in development to direct other neurons to become similarly selective.

Although the activity dependence of synaptic efficacy has been studied extensively. less is known about how activity shapes the intrinsic electrical properties of neurons. Lobster stomatogastric ganglion neurons fire in bursts when receiving synaptic and modulatory input but fire tonically when pharmacologically isolated. Long-term isolation in culture changed their intrinsic activity from tonic firing to burst firing. Rhythmic stimulation reversed this transition through a mechanism that was mediated by a rise in intracellular calcium concentration.

Models in which memories are stored through switch-like transitions in synaptic efficacy are good at storing but bad at retaining memories if these transitions are likely. and they are poor at storage but good at retention if they are unlikely. We construct and study a model in which each synapse has a cascade of states with different levels of plasticity. connected by metaplastic transitions. This cascade model combines high levels of memory storage with long retention times and significantly outperforms alternative models. As a result. we suggest that memory storage requires synapses with multiple states exhibiting dynamics over a wide range of timescales. and we suggest experimental tests of this hypothesis.,True,ca_O-WQAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,466,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305001170,3075462260226972027,/scholar?cites=3075462260226972027,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305001170,0,0,0

Transcriptional velocities for single molecules of Escherichia coli RNAP were measured as progressively larger forces were applied by a feedback-controlled optical trap. The shapes of RNAP force-velocity curves are distinct from those of the motor enzymes myosin or kinesin. and indicate that biochemical steps limiting transcription rates at low loads do not generate movement.

Over the past two decades. the combination of optical microscopy and genetically encoded fluorescent indicators has become a widespread means of recording neural activity in nonmammalian and mammalian nervous systems. transforming brain research in the process.

To overcome this limitation. we developed two forms of minimally invasive fluorescence microendoscopy and tested their abilities to image cells in vivo. Both one- and two-photon fluorescence microendoscopy are based on compound gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses that are 350–1.000 μm in diameter and provide micron-scale resolution. One-photon microendoscopy allows full-frame images to be viewed by eye or with a camera. and is well suited to fast frame-rate imaging.

In this study. high molecular weight DNA from cells containing only one copy of the HSV gene coding for tk was successfully used to transform Ltk− cells to the tk+ phenotype. The acquired phenotype was demonstrated to be donor-derived by analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of the tk activity. and the presence of HSV DNA sequences in the recipient cells was demonstrated. In companion experiments. we used high molecular weight DNA derived from tissues and cultured cells of a variety of species to transfer tk activity.

1192744,A novel family of genes encoding putative pheromone receptors in mammals,1995,Catherine Dulac and Richard Axel,83,Cell,2,195-206,Cell Press,In mammals. olfactory sensory perception is mediated by two anatomically and functionally distinct sensory organs: the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and the vomeronasal organ (VNO). Pheromones activate the VNO and elicit a characteristic array of innate reproductive and social behaviors. along with dramatic neuroendocrine responses. Differential screening of cDNA libraries constructed from single sensory neurons from the rat VNO has led to the isolation of a family of about 30 putative receptor genes. Sequence analysis indicates that these genes comprise a novel family of seven transmembrane domain proteins unrelated to the receptors expressed in the MOE.

We have examined the patterns of odorant receptor expression in the rat olfactory epithelium to determine whether the mammalian olfactory system employs spatial segregation of sensory input to encode the identity of an odorant stimulus. In situ hybridization experiments with probes for 11 different odorant receptors demonstrate that sensory neurons expressing distinct receptors are topologically segregated into a small number of broad. yet circumscribed. zones within the olfactory epithelium.

In Drosophila melanogaster. as in many insects. cuticular hydrocarbons are thought to be involved in sex recognition and in mating behavior. but there is no direct neuronal evidence of their pheromonal effect. Using behavioral and electrophysiological measures of responses to natural and synthetic compounds. we show that Z-7-tricosene. a Drosophila male cuticular hydrocarbon. acts as a sex pheromone and inhibits male-male courtship. These data provide the first direct demonstration that an insect cuticular hydrocarbon is detected as a sex pheromone. Intriguingly. we show that a particular type of gustatory neurons of the labial palps respond both to Z-7-tricosene and to bitter stimuli. Cross-adaptation between Z-7-tricosene and bitter stimuli further indicates that these two very different substances are processed by the same neural pathways. Furthermore. the two substances induced similar behavioral responses both in courtship and feeding tests.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In Drosophila. gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) occur within hair‐like structures called sensilla. Most taste sensilla house four GRNs. which have been named according to their preferred sensitivity to basic stimuli: water (W cell). sugars (S cell). salt at low concentration (L1 cell). and salt at high concentration (L2 cell). Labellar taste sensilla are classified into three types. l‐. s‐. and i‐type. according to their length and location. Of these. l‐ and s‐type labellar sensilla possess these four cells. but most i‐type sensilla house only two GRNs. In i‐type sensilla. we demonstrate here that the first GRN responds to sugar and to low concentrations of salt (10–50 mM NaCl). The second GRN detects a range of bitter compounds. among which strychnine is the most potent; and also to salt at high concentrations (over 400 mM NaCl). Neither type of GRN responds to water.

In contrast. the significance of their spontaneous activity remains elusive. In Drosophila melanogaster. depolarization of the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster dopamine neurons en masse signals reward to the mushroom body (MB) and drives appetitive memory. Focusing on the functional heterogeneity of PAM cluster neurons. we identified that a single class of PAM neurons. PAM-γ3. mediates sugar reward by suppressing their own activity. PAM-γ3 is selectively required for appetitive olfactory learning. while activation of these neurons in turn induces aversive memory. Ongoing activity of PAM-γ3 gets suppressed upon sugar ingestion. Strikingly. transient inactivation of basal PAM-γ3 activity can substitute for reward and induces appetitive memory. Furthermore. we identified the satiety-signaling neuropeptide Allatostatin A (AstA) as a key mediator that conveys inhibitory input onto PAM-γ3. Our results suggest the significance of basal dopamine release in reward signaling and reveal a circuit mechanism for negative regulation.,True,pWK4yakAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,44,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002586,6332557322094760469,/scholar?cites=6332557322094760469,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002586,0,0,0
1192765,Hedonic taste in Drosophila revealed by olfactory receptors expressed in taste neurons,2008,Makoto Hiroi and Teiichi Tanimura and Frédéric Marion-Poll,3,PloS one,7,e2610,Public Library of Science,Taste and olfaction are each tuned to a unique set of chemicals in the outside world. and their corresponding sensory spaces are mapped in different areas in the brain. This dichotomy matches categories of receptors detecting molecules either in the gaseous or in the liquid phase in terrestrial animals. However. in Drosophila olfactory and gustatory neurons express receptors which belong to the same family of 7-transmembrane domain proteins. Striking overlaps exist in their sequence structure and in their expression pattern. suggesting that there might be some functional commonalities between them. In this work. we tested the assumption that Drosophila olfactory receptor proteins are compatible with taste neurons by ectopically expressing an olfactory receptor (OR22a and OR83b) for which ligands are known. Using electrophysiological recordings. we show that the transformed taste neurons are excited by odor ligands as by their cognate tastants. The wiring of these neurons to the brain seems unchanged and no additional connections to the antennal lobe were detected. The odor ligands detected by the olfactory receptor acquire a new hedonic value. inducing appetitive or aversive behaviors depending on the categories of taste neurons in which they are expressed i.e. sugar- or bitter-sensing cells expressing either Gr5a or Gr66a receptors. Taste neurons expressing ectopic olfactory receptors can sense odors at close range either in the aerial phase or by contact. in a lipophilic phase. The responses of the transformed taste neurons to the odorant are similar to those obtained with tastants.

The center for memory formation is the mushroom body which consists of Kenyon cells (KCs). dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and mushroom body output neurons (MBONs). However. the roles of individual neurons are not fully understood. We focused on the role of a single pair of GABAergic neurons (MBON‐γ1pedc) and found that it could inhibit the effects of DANs. resulting in the suppression of aversive memory acquisition during the CS− odor presentation. but not during the CS+ odor presentation.

However. the molecular mechanisms that control branch formation are poorly understood. In particular. previous studies have rarely addressed the mechanisms underlying axonal bifurcation. in which axons form new branches via splitting of the growth cone. We demonstrate that DISCO Interacting Protein 2 (DIP2) is required for precise axonal bifurcation in Drosophila mushroom body (MB) neurons by suppressing ectopic bifurcation and regulating the guidance of sister axons. We also found that DIP2 localize to the plasma membrane. Domain function analysis revealed that the AMP-synthetase domains of DIP2 are essential for its function. which may involve exerting a catalytic activity that modifies fatty acids.

New York,The sense of taste is essential for all organisms to make decisions about ingesting or rejecting food items. by discriminating chemicals within the oral cavity. Although the sensory organs differ in mammals and in invertebrates. their taste receptors fall into at least two modalities which allow the detection of appetitive chemicals such as nutriments and aversive chemicals such as bitter substances. In insects. contact chemoreception plays additional important roles related to encounters between the sexes. species isolation. social interactions and egg-laying. For example. the courtship behaviour of Drosophila involves a series of behaviours and the emission and detection of volatile and contact pheromones from both partners which are important for sexual recognition (Ferveur. 2005). In mammals. the detection of sex pheromones seems to be carried out solely by the olfactory system. either by the vomeronasal organ (Buck. 2004; Keverne. 1999) or by odorant receptors in the main nasal cavity (Liberles and Buck. 2006). while in Drosophila. pheromones are perceived both by olfactory and gustatory organs (Benton. 2007; Hallem et al.. 2006). Social insects such as ants. termites and honeybees detect chemical cues from their colony by contact chemoreception (Ozaki et al.. 2005). Phytophagous insects use contact chemoreception to detect lipids at the surface of the plants (Müller and Riederer. 2005). chemicals which contribute to triggering feeding or oviposition behaviours and that are used as cues to identify a proper host plant (Chapman. 2003).

A subset of KCs responds to a given odor molecule. and the combination of these KCs represents a part of the neuronal olfactory code. KCs are also thought to function as coincidence detectors for memory formation. associating odor information with a coincident punishment or reward stimulus. Associative conditioning has been shown to modify KC output. This plasticity occurs in the vertical lobes of MBs containing α/α' branches of KCs. which is shown by measuring the average Ca2+ levels in the branch of each lobe.

Kathmandu from December 2006 to September 2007. The seroprevalence of HIV was 0.19%(95% CI= 0.15-0.25) and co-infection with HCV was found in 10.8%(95% CI= 4.4-20.9). There were no significant differences in HIV seroprevalence among the different categories of age. sex. type of donation and time of donation. The study revealed a relatively lower seroprevalence of HIV among blood donors in Kathmandu Valley than reported earlier but a higher HCV co-infection rate. The similar seroprevalence between first time and repeat donors suggests the need for more improved donor education and counselling.Globally. 33.2 (30.6-36.1) million people were living with HIV in 2007 (UNAIDS. 2007).

In this study. we aimed to measure the prevalence and identify the factors associated with intestinal parasitic infection in people infected with HIV and attending National Public Health Laboratory in Kathmandu. Nepal. for CD4 T-cell count.Methodology: An analytical cross-sectional study in 745 HIV-infected people attending for CD4 T-cell count was conducted.Results: The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was 22.4%(95% CI 19.5 to 25.5). In univariate analysis. age. sex. longer time since diagnosis of HIV. CD4 T-cell count of< 200/µL. diarrhoea. marital status. and being under tuberculosis (TB) treatment were significantly associated with increased odds of intestinal parasite infection. However. in the logistic regression model. only the CD4 T-cell count of< 200/µL (adjusted OR= 4.2. 95% CI 2.5 to 7.0). diarrhoea (adjusted OR= 2.8. 95% CI 1.8 to 4.3) and being under TB treatment (adjusted OR= 2.9. 95% CI 1.8 to 4.6) remained as significant predictors.

Stigma is a dynamic process resulting from the interaction between physical attributes caused by leprosy and the existing stereotypes in a community. Leprosy has pervasive impacts on all areas of life including psychosocial burden to an individual. social interaction. marriage. and employment. These impacts vary and are largely dependent on a particular culture and community. The main objective of this study was to explore the perceived stigma of leprosy amongst community members and health care providers in Lalitpur district of Nepal.   Methods A total of six focused group discussions (FGDs) with 43 participants from a community living close to Anandaban Leprosy Hospital and ten semi structured interviews (SSIs) with health care providers were conducted between October and December 2016. An interview guide was used for the FGDs and SSIs. All qualitative data were transcribed and translated into English and were thematically analyzed using Atlas.ti software.   Results Visible deformities due to leprosy was one of the major contributing factors for stigma. Stigma was further exacerbated by an attitude to conceal the disease due to perceived fear of potential discrimination. While over the years. stigma was felt to be decreasing. various aspects of life were still affected by leprosy stigma including marriage. employment and social interaction.

The main objective of this study was to estimate the risk of malaria at Village Development Committee (VDC) level in Nepal based on disease. vector. parasite. and geography. In 2012. the micro-stratification of malaria risk was carried out in 75 districts of Nepal. Instruments such as a questionnaire. case record forms. and guidelines for malaria micro-stratification were developed and pre-tested for necessary adaptations. Village Development Committee (VDC)-wise malaria data were analyzed using exploratory statistics and were stratified by geographical variables that contributed to the risk of malaria. To understand the transmission risk at VDC level. overlay analysis was done using ArcGIS 10. To ensure transparent. reproducible. and comprehensible risk assessment. standard scoring method was selected and utilized for data from 2009 to 2011.

The usnic acid content varied in between highest 5.13% to lowest 1.66% in oven dried (80 C) lichen samples. The species collected from lower altitudes all show high levels of usnic acid. The negative relationship between usnic acid and altitude was obtained. Statistically. it is revealed that there is a significant difference between average percentages of usnic acid in lichen samples with varying altitudes (p< 0.05). Beside these. the precipitation averages of the regions where the species have been collected were linked with the content of usnic acid. It is clear that lichens from the regions receiving the highest precipitation produced lower amounts of usnic acid. The results suggest that the production of secondary metabolite in lichens is altered due to the climatic variables like temperature and precipitation at different altitude gradients.

Pokhara University. Nepal,Sulfurated hydrogen commonly called hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a clear. colorless. extremely toxic gas that has a rotten egg smell at low concentration. The human nose can detect H2 S at concentrations below 100 parts per billion (ppb). It is found least amount in cigarette smoke that has been the subject of analysis for many analytical chemists. This gases is soluble in alkaline medium and gives free sulfide (S-2) ions. Sulfide ion concentration in cigarette smoke solution is found in the range of detection limit of lab made Silver-silver sulfide (Ag/Ag2 S) ion selective electrode (ISE). This project has designed to investigate the amount hydrogen sulfide as a free sulfide (S--) ion in cigarette smoke solution. Silver-silver sulfide ion selective electrode (Ag/Ag2 S ISE) and Silver–silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode are prepared in the lab for determination. Detail protocol of standard addition method with modified Grant’s plot is applied for estimation. Different brand of cigarette samples were collected from different area of Pokhara valley and analyzed. The average amount of H2 S per stick of cigarette smoke is found to vary from 0.0453 mg to 0.0573 mg in different brands. Among them sample no SA-5 shows 0.0453 mg per stick of cigarette. This result is minimum in compare to other brands. Similarly. sample no SA-7 have found 0.0573 mg per stick which is higher in compare to other brands.,True,DwwTuUAAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://www.jhas.org.np/jhas/index.php/jhas/article/view/39,,,,https://www.jhas.org.np/jhas/index.php/jhas/article/download/39/38,0,0,0

S. aureus causes a wide range of diseases from skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) to debilitating and life-threatening conditions such as osteomyelitis. endocarditis. and necrotizing pneumonia. The range of diseases reflects the remarkable diversity of the virulence factors produced by this pathogen. including surface antigens involved in the establishment of infection and a large number of toxins that mediate a vast array of cellular responses. The staphylococcal toxins are generally believed to have evolved to disarm the innate immune system. the first line of defense against this pathogen. This review focuses on recent advances on elucidating the biological functions of S. aureus bicomponent pore-forming toxins (BCPFTs) and their utility as targets for preventive and therapeutic intervention. These toxins are cytolytic to a variety of immune cells. primarily neutrophils. as well as cells with a critical barrier function.

The conventional approach to achieve sterile immunity through opsonophagocytic killing has been largely unsuccessful. S. aureus is highly toxigenic and a great body of evidence suggests that a successful future vaccine for this organism should target extracellular toxins which are responsible for host tissue destruction and immunosuppression. Major staphylococcal toxins are alpha toxin (a single subunit hemolysin) along with a group of bicomponent pore-forming toxins (BCPFT). namely Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). gamma hemolysins (HlgCB and AB). LukAB and LukED. In our previous report. an attenuated mutant of LukS-PV (PVL- S subunit) named as “LukS-mut9” elicited high immunogenic response as well as provided a significant protection in a mouse sepsis model. Recent discovery of PVL receptors shows that mice lack receptors for this toxin. thus the reported protection of mice with the PVL vaccine may relate to cross protective responses against other homologous toxins. This manuscript addresses this issue by demonstrating that polyclonal antibody generated by LukS-mut9 can neutralize other canonical and non-canonical leukotoxin pairs. In this report. we also demonstrated that several potent toxins can be created by non-canonical pairing of subunits. Out of 5 pairs of canonical and 8 pairs of non-canonical toxins tested. anti-LukS-mut9 polyclonal antibodies neutralized all except for LukAB. We also studied the potential hemolytic activities of canonical and noncanonical pairs among biocomponent toxins and discovered that a novel non-canonical pair …,True,W0rpbTEAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,27,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137874,13346191083431255903,/scholar?cites=13346191083431255903,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137874,0,0,0

It also inhibits other processes that utilize essential thiols. Cerulenin has been widely reported to block protein secretion at sub-MIC levels. an effect that has been postulated to represent interference with membrane function through interference with normal fatty acid synthesis. This study confirms the profound reduction in extracellular proteins caused by low concentrations of the antibiotic. and shows by Northern blot hybridization that this reduction is due to interference with transcription. By exchanging promoters between entB. a gene that is inhibited by cerulenin. and entA. a gene that is not. it was also shown that the antibiotic does not block secretion.

These toxins kill the polymorphonuclear phagocytes (PMNs). disrupt epithelial and endothelial barriers. and lyse erythrocytes to provide iron for bacterial growth. The expression of these toxins is regulated by the two-component sensing systems Sae and Agr. Here. we report that a point mutation (L18P) in SaeS. the histidine kinase sensor of the Sae system. renders the S. aureus Newman hemolytic activity fully independent of Hla and drastically increases the PMN lytic activity. Furthermore. this Hla-independent activity. unlike Hla itself. can lyse human erythrocytes. The Hla-independent activity towards human erythrocytes was also evident in USA300. however. under strict agr control. Gene knockout studies revealed that this Hla-independent Sae-regulated activity was entirely dependent on gamma hemolysin A subunit (HlgA). In contrast. hemolytic activity of Newman towards human erythrocytes from HlgAB resistant donors was completely dependent on agr. The culture supernatant from Newman S. aureus could be neutralized by antisera against two vaccine candidates based on LukS and LukF subunits of Panton-Valentine leukocidin but not by an anti-Hla neutralizing antibody.

This data was used to examine the phylogenetic relationships among 19 talpid species within the family Talpidae (Mammalia: Eulipotyphla). Cytochrome b gene trees supported a basal placement of shrew-like moles (Uropsilus) within the Talpidae. and suggested that fossorial specializations arose twice during talpid evolution.

Two sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). ITS1 and ITS2. of the ascarid parasites were amplified and compared with those of ascarid-nematodes registered in a DNA database (GenBank).

However. a consensus hypothesis pertaining to the evolutionary history and biogeography of this group remains elusive. Recent phylogenetic studies utilizing nucleotide sequences have provided reasonably consistent branching patterns for Japanese talpids. but have generally suffered from a lack of closely related South-East Asian species for sound biogeographic interpretations. As an initial step in achieving this goal. we constructed phylogenetic trees using publicly accessible mitochondrial and nuclear sequences from seven Japanese taxa. and those of related insular and continental species for which nucleotide data is available. The resultant trees support the view that four lineages (Euroscaptor mizura. Mogera tokuade species group [M. tokudae and M. etigo]. M. imaizumii. and M. wogura) migrated separately. and in this order. from the continental Asian mainland to Japan. The close relationship of M. tokudae and M. etigo suggests these lineages diverged recently through a vicariant event between Sado Island and Echigo plain.

In part. this may be a consequence of such studies focusing on the reef-building (shallow water and zooxanthellate) Scleractinia. and largely ignoring the large number of deep-sea species. To better understand broad patterns of coral evolution. we generated molecular data for a broad and representative range of deep sea scleractinians collected off New Caledonia and Australia during the last decade. and conducted the most comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis to date of the order Scleractinia.  Methodology Partial (595 bp) sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene were determined for 65 deep-sea (azooxanthellate) scleractinians and 11 shallow-water species. These new data were aligned with 158 published sequences. generating a 234 taxon dataset representing 25 of the 27 currently recognized scleractinian families.  Principal Findings/Conclusions There was a striking discrepancy between the taxonomic validity of coral families consisting predominantly of deep-sea or shallow-water species. Most families composed predominantly of deep-sea azooxanthellate species were monophyletic in both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses but. by contrast (and consistent with previous studies). most families composed predominantly of shallow-water zooxanthellate taxa were polyphyletic. although Acroporidae.

The organization of these genomes is not strikingly different from those of other eumetazoans. although one gene (atp8) commonly found in other phyla is absent from flatworms. The gene order in most flatworms has similarities to those seen in higher protostomes such as annelids. However. the gene order has been drastically altered in Schistosoma mansoni. which obscures this possible relationship. Among the sequenced taxa. base composition varies considerably. creating potential difficulties for phylogeny reconstruction.

Their inter-relationships over such a time-span must have been complex and varied. Few studies have attempted to explore these relationships in the light of knowledge of the phylogeny of both host and parasite groups. Here we focus on two important families of digeneans. the Schistosomatidae and the Paragonimidae. for which molecular phylogenies are available. We investigate the types of evolutionary relationships between host and parasite. operating at different phylogenetic depths. that might explain current host specificity and distributions of both associates. Both families of parasites utilise a number of highly diverged gastropod families. indicating that host extensions have featured in their histories. However. schistosomatids and paragonimids show different patterns of association with their snail hosts. As befits the apparently more ancient group. schistosomatids utilise snails from across a wide phylogenetic range within the Gastropoda. The genus Schistosoma itself has experienced one long-range host switch between pulmonates and caenogastropods. By contrast. paragonimids are restricted to two superfamilies of caenogastropods. Despite these differences. modern schistosomatid species appear to be more host specific than are paragonimids and host additions. at the level of host family. are far less common among species of schistosomatids than among paragonimids.

It is characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of cognitive abilities and formation of senile plaques. composed mainly of amyloid β (Aβ). and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). composed of tau protein. in the hippocampus and cortex of afflicted humans. In brains of AD patients the metabolism of Aβ is dysregulated. which leads to the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ. Metabolism of Aβ and tau proteins is crucially influenced by autophagy. Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent. homeostatic process. in which organelles and proteins are degraded and recycled into energy. Thus. dysfunction of autophagy is suggested to lead to the accretion of noxious proteins in the AD brain. In the present review. we describe the process of autophagy and its importance in AD.

The involved mechanisms in these findings include mitigating the production of reactive oxygen species. inhibiting the tumor necrosis factor-α and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways. suppressing p53-dependent apoptosis. and suppressing the production of inflammatory markers. such as interleukin- (IL-) 8. IL-6. IL-1a. and endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1. Consumption of products containing these phytochemicals may be protective against these diseases; however. adequate human data are lacking.

Male Swiss albino mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of MTX (at 20 mg/kg. body weight) either alone or in combination with oral diosmin (at 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight. for 10 days). Serum was used to evaluate tissue injury markers. while hepatic. renal. and cardiac tissue samples were obtained for determination of antioxidant activity as well as histopathological examination. Diosmin treatment ameliorated the MTX-induced elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase. aminotransferases. urea. creatinine. lactate dehydrogenase. and creatine kinases as well as plasma proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1-beta. interleukin-6. and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Additionally. both diosmin doses significantly reduced tissue levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide and increased those of glutathione. glutathione peroxidase. glutathione reductase. glutathione S-transferase. superoxide dismutase. and catalase. compared to the MTX-intoxicated group. Histopathological examination showed that diosmin significantly minimized the MTX-induced histological alterations and nearly restored the normal architecture of hepatic. renal. and cardiac tissues.

This study investigated the effects of Commiphora molmol resin on oxidative stress. inflammation. and hematological alterations in ammonium chloride- (NH4Cl-) induced hyperammonemic rats. with an emphasis on the glutamate-NO-cGMP and Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 signaling pathways. Rats received NH4Cl and C. molmol for 8 weeks. NH4Cl-induced rats showed significant increase in blood ammonia. liver function markers. and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Concurrent supplementation of C. molmol significantly decreased circulating ammonia. liver function markers. and TNF-α in hyperammonemic rats. C. molmol suppressed lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide and enhanced the antioxidant defenses in the liver. kidney. and cerebrum of hyperammonemic rats. C. molmol significantly upregulated Nrf2 and HO-1 and decreased glutamine and nitric oxide synthase. soluble guanylate cyclase. and Na+/K+-ATPase expression in the cerebrum of NH4Cl-induced hyperammonemic rats. Hyperammonemia was also associated with hematological and coagulation system alterations. These alterations were reversed by C. molmol. Our findings demonstrated that C. molmol attenuates ammonia-induced liver injury. oxidative stress. inflammation. and hematological alterations. This study points to the modulatory effect of C. molmol on glutamate-NO-cGMP and Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 pathways in hyperammonemia. Therefore.

The colorimetric recognition of the analyte is based on a tannaactivated silica dipstick with a determination limit in the ppm level. The best detection of Fe (III) was accomplished in a pH range from 3.2 to 8.8. The metallochromic tannin-impregnated silica diagnostic tool provided an instant color alteration from yellow to dark purple upon immersion in an aqueous environment of ferric cation as was demonstrated by the coloration measurements. This color shift is proportionally correlated with increasing the ferric concentration. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were performed. The sensor demonstrated high selectivity to Fe (III). while no color change was monitored for other metals.

1192985,The role of Nrf2 in cardiovascular function and disease,2017,Sandro Satta and Ayman M Mahmoud and Fiona L Wilkinson and M Yvonne Alexander and Stephen J White,2017,,,,Hindawi,Free radicals. reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). hydrogen sulphide. and hydrogen peroxide play an important role in both intracellular and intercellular signaling; however. their production and quenching need to be closely regulated to prevent cellular damage. An imbalance. due to exogenous sources of free radicals and chronic upregulation of endogenous production. contributes to many pathological conditions including cardiovascular disease and also more general processes involved in aging. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2; commonly known as Nrf2) is a transcription factor that plays a major role in the dynamic regulation of a network of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. through binding to and activating expression of promoters containing the antioxidant response element (ARE). Nrf2 activity is regulated by many mechanisms. suggesting that tight control is necessary for normal cell function and both hypoactivation and hyperactivation of Nrf2 are indicated in playing a role in different aspects of cardiovascular disease. Targeted activation of Nrf2 or downstream genes may prove to be a useful avenue in developing therapeutics to reduce the impact of cardiovascular disease. We will review the current status of Nrf2 and related signaling in cardiovascular disease and its relevance to current and potential treatment strategies.,True,_n9c8v4AAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C,90,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/9237263/abs/,8575622172776875670,/scholar?cites=8575622172776875670,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/9237263/abs/,0,0,0

The current study aimed to investigate the protective action and the possible mechanisms of 18β-GA against cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced liver injury in rats. focusing on the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Rats were administered 18β-GA at doses 25 and 50 mg/kg 2 weeks prior to CP injection. Five days after CP administration. animals were sacrificed and samples were collected. CP induced hepatic damage evidenced by the histopathological changes and significant increase in serum pro-inflammatory cytokines. liver marker enzymes. and liver lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide (NO) levels. 18β-GA counteracted CP-induced oxidative stress and inflammation as assessed by restoration of the antioxidant defenses and diminishing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. lipid peroxidation. and NO production. These hepatoprotective effects appear to depend on activation of Nrf2 and PPARγ. and subsequent suppression of nuclear factor-kappa B. In conclusion. the present study provides evidence that 18β-GA exerts hepatoprotective effects against CP through induction of antioxidant defenses and suppression of inflammatory response.

Currently. natural products are regarded as an alternative approach to discover novel multipotent drugs against AD. Dietary soy isoflavone genistein is one of the examples of such agents that occurs naturally and is known to exert a number of beneficial health effects. It has been observed that genistein has the capacity to improve the impairments triggered by Aβ and also it possesses the antioxidant potential to scavenge the AD-mediated generation of free radicals. Furthermore. genistein can interact directly with the targeted signaling proteins and also can stabilize their activity to combat AD. In order to advance the development of AD treatment. a better comprehension of the direct interactions of target proteins and genistein might prove beneficial.

Even though advancement has been observed in order to understand AD pathogenesis. currently available therapeutic methods can only deliver modest symptomatic relief. Interestingly. naturally occurring dietary flavonoids have gained substantial attention due to their antioxidative. anti-inflammatory. and anti-amyloidogenic properties as alternative candidates for AD therapy. Experimental proof provides support to the idea that some flavonoids might protect AD by interfering with the production and aggregation of Aβ peptides and/or decreasing the aggregation of tau. Flavonoids have the ability to promote clearance of Aβ peptides and inhibit tau phosphorylation by the mTOR/autophagy signaling pathway. Moreover. due to their cholinesterase inhibitory potential. flavonoids can represent promising symptomatic anti-Alzheimer agents. Several processes have been suggested for the aptitude of flavonoids to slow down the advancement or to avert the onset of Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. To enhance cognitive performance and to prevent the onset and progress of AD. the interaction of flavonoids with various signaling pathways is proposed to exert their therapeutic potential.

A hallmark of AD is the deregulation of the level of ß-amyloid (Aß) that leads to the appearance of the senile plaques that contain Aß derived from the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Among numerous risk factors for AD. genetic risk factor such as possession of ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) is considered as a crucial risk factor. Moreover. dietary fat composition has also been concerned as an important factor for AD since cholesterol and blood-brain barrier functions are linked with AD. The primary genetic risk factor is ApoE ε4 allele that encodes one of several proteins responsible for cholesterol transport and it is considered as foremost cholesterol transport proteins in the brain. For the progression of AD high level of serum/plasma cholesterol has been recommended as a causative factor. But this statement is debatable meanwhile brain cholesterol levels of AD patients are highly variable and cholesterol levels in serum/plasma and brain of AD patients do not consider cholesterol as a risk factor in AD. Indeed. APOE ε4 is neither essential nor enough for the development of AD. it only serves as a synergistic and increases the risk of AD. Another prominent feature of AD is region-specific declines in brain glucose metabolism.

Unfortunately. almost all of the drug candidates tested for AD until now have failed to exhibit any efficacy. Henceforth. there is an increased necessity to avert and/or slow down the advancement of AD. It is known that one of the major pathological characteristics of AD is the presence of senile plaques (SPs) in the brain. These SPs are composed of aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ). derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP).

Most of the caffeine consumed comes from coffee bean (ie. a misnomer for the seed of Coffea plants). beverages (ie. coffee. tea. soft drinks). in products containing cocoa or chocolate and in medications (ie. analgesics. stimulants. weight-loss products. sports nutrition). The most prominent behavioral effects of caffeine take place over low to moderate doses are amplified alertness and attention. Moderate caffeine consumption leads very rarely to health risks. Higher doses of caffeine encourage negative effects such as anxiety. insomnia. restlessness and tachycardia. The habitual use of caffeine causes physical dependence that displays as caffeine withdrawal symptoms that harm normal functioning. Contrariwise. rarely high doses of caffeine can encourage psychotic and manic symptoms usually. sleep disturbances and anxiety. Even though caffeine does not engender life-threatening health difficulties frequently related to the utilization of drugs of addiction. for example amphetamine. cocaine and heroin. an incrementing number of clinical studies are exhibiting that some caffeine users become dependent on the drug and are unable to reduce consumption despite knowledge of recurrent health complications linked to constant use.

There is a widespread antimicrobial resistance among S. enterica serotypes. and innovative solutions to antibiotic resistance are needed. We aimed to use probiotics to reduce antibiotic resistance and identify the major probiotic players that modify the early interactions between S. enterica and host cells. One-day-old cobb broiler chicks were challenged with S. typhimurium after oral inoculation with different probiotic strains for 3 days. The adherence of different probiotic strains to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells was studied in vitro. Lactobacillus (Lacticaseibacillus) casei ATTC334 and Bifidobacterium breve JCM1192 strains attached to Caco-2 cells stronger than B. infantis BL2416. L. casei ATTC334 and B. breve JCM1192 reduced S. typhimurium recovery from the cecal tonsils by competitive exclusion mechanism. Although B. infantis BL2416 bound poorly to Caco-2 epithelial cells. it reduced S. typhimurium recovery and increased IFN-γ and TNF-α production. L. casei ATTC334. B. breve JCM1192 and B. infantis BL2416 improved body weight gain and the food conversion rate in S. typhimurium-infected broilers. B. longum Ncc2785 neither attached to epithelial cells nor induced IFN-γ and TNF-α release and consequently did not prevent S. typhimurium colonization in broiler chickens.

All over the world salt lakes are threatened by climate change. water diversions upstream for agricultural purposes. watershed changes. introduction of aliens. etc. that result in catastrophic changes of the lakes. Among the examples of this there are the largest saline lakes including Great Salt Lake. Owens Lake. Mono Lake (N. America). Laguna Mar Chicuita (S. America). the Dead and Aral Seas. Ebinur Lake. Urmia Lake (Asia). St. Lucia Estuary (Africa). etc. A lot of negative consequences for human communities are resulted from that. In our World of Change some changes are a natural result of the global climate system variability. but the responsibility for other changes falls squarely on humanity’s shoulders. We need to know how to divide these two groups of the causes of the salt lake changes to predict and mitigate the negative results. Lake Qarun (Moeris) is a terminal saline lake in the northern part of El-Fayum Depression (Middle Egypt.~ 80 km southwest of Cairo. at the margin of the Nile Valley). It lays on 29 30'N and 30 40'E. The lake's surface area is 43 m below sea-level. and covers about 202 sq km. It is the third largest lake in Egypt and supports human culture during about 7.000 years (Hassan. 1986). This means that climate fluctuations and anthropogenic activities interact as the causes of the lake changes during that long time.

Because of its unique metabolism. the kidney is an important target of the toxicity of drugs. xenobiotics. and oxidative stress. Gentamicin (GM) is an antibiotic induced nephrotoxicity as it induces conspicuous and characteristic changes in lysosomes of proximal tubular cells consistent with the accumulation of polar lipids (myeloid bodies). These changes are preceded and accompanied by signs of tubular dysfunctions or alterations (release of brush border and lysosomal enzymes; decreased reabsorption of filtered proteins. The effect of gentamicin (80 mg/kg Bw/day) without or with oral administration of aqueous purslane (Portulaca oleracea) extract (400mg/kg BW/day) and fish oil (5mg/kg BW/day) co-treatments for 15 days was evaluated in adult male rats (80-120g). Plasma urea. uric acid and creatinine levels were assayed. Lipid peroxidation (indexed by MDA) and antioxidants enzymes like GSH. SOD and CAT were assessed. There was a decrease in plasma levels concentration of urea. uric acid and creatinine. In addition to decreasing in activities of GSH. SOD and CAT as well as an increasing in MDA concentration in the kidney as a result of gentamicin injection. Co-administration of aqueous purslane extract and fish oil was found to improve the adverse changes in the kidney functions with an increase in antioxidants activities and reduction of peroxidation.

1193144,Protective effects of rutin and hesperidin against doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity,2012,Howida S Abou Seif,1,Beni-Suef Univ. J App Sci,2,1-18,,Due to the great importance of doxorubicin in chemotherapy for the treatment of many types of cancer. researchers have expended great efforts trying to prevent or attenuate the side effects of adriamycin administration. The most immediate approach has been the combination of the drug delivery together with an antioxidant in order to reduce oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective role of rutin and hesperidin on experimental doxorubicin–induced nephrotoxicity. Doxorubicin (DXR)–administered rats were pretreated with rutin. hesperidin. both rutin and hesperidin (50 mg/kg body weight) three times per week for three weeks and DXR 25mg/kg b. wt three times per week (at the last two weeks of the experiment). Results showed that DXR caused a marked rise in serum urea. creatinine. sodium and potassium levels. Concomitant to these biochemical changes in kidney were observed in DXR-administered animals. Pretreatment of these animals with rutin. hesperidin and both rutin & hesperidin successfully prevents most of these biochemical alterations; the pretreatment with both rutin and hesperidin seemed to be the most potent. DXR administered rats also had depleted renal glutathione-S-transferase. This enzyme increased above normal levels in the rats with a pretreatment of rutin. hesperidin and both rutin and hesperidin.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the protective role of rutin and hesperidin on doxorubicin–induced lipodystrophy and cardiotoxicity in albino rats. Doxorubicin (DXR)–administered rats (25 mg/kg; three times interaperitoneally/week for two weeks) were pretreated with rutin and/or hesperidin (50 mg/kg body weight) three times per week for three weeks and DXR 25mg/kg b. wt three times per week (at the last two weeks of the experiment). Results showed that DXR caused a marked rise in serum total cholesterol. high density lipoprotein. low density lipoprotein. creatine kinas and lactate dehydrogenase (HDL. LDL. CK. LDH) as well as aspartate aminotransferase; AST. Pretreatment of these animals with rutin and/or hesperidin successfully prevent most of these biochemical alterations; the pretreatment with both rutin and hesperidin seemed to be the most potent.

It is characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of cognitive abilities and formation of senile plaques. composed mainly of amyloid β (Aβ). and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). composed of tau protein. in the hippocampus and cortex of afflicted humans. In brains of AD patients the metabolism of Aβ is dysregulated. which leads to the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ. Metabolism of Aβ and tau proteins is crucially influenced by autophagy. Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent. homeostatic process. in which organelles and proteins are degraded and recycled into energy. Thus. dysfunction of autophagy is suggested to lead to the accretion of noxious proteins in the AD brain. In the present review. we describe the process of autophagy and its importance in AD. Additionally. we discuss mechanisms and genes linking autophagy and AD. i.e.. the mTOR pathway. neuroinflammation. endocannabinoid system. ATG7. BCL2. BECN1. CDK5. CLU. CTSD. FOXO1. GFAP. ITPR1.

Even though advancement has been observed in order to understand AD pathogenesis. currently available therapeutic methods can only deliver modest symptomatic relief. Interestingly. naturally occurring dietary flavonoids have gained substantial attention due to their antioxidative. anti-inflammatory. and anti-amyloidogenic properties as alternative candidates for AD therapy. Experimental proof provides support to the idea that some flavonoids might protect AD by interfering with the production and aggregation of Aβ peptides and/or decreasing the aggregation of tau. Flavonoids have the ability to promote clearance of Aβ peptides and inhibit tau phosphorylation by the mTOR/autophagy signaling pathway. Moreover. due to their cholinesterase inhibitory potential. flavonoids can represent promising symptomatic anti-Alzheimer agents. Several processes have been suggested for the aptitude of flavonoids to slow down the advancement or to avert the onset of Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. To enhance cognitive performance and to prevent the onset and progress of AD. the interaction of flavonoids with various signaling pathways is proposed to exert their therapeutic potential. Therefore. this review elaborates on the probable therapeutic approaches of flavonoids aimed at averting or slowing the progression of the AD pathogenesis.

Even though the number of AD patients is rapidly growing. there is no effective treatment for this neurodegenerative disorder. At present. implementation of effective treatment approaches for AD is vital to meet clinical needs. In AD research. priorities concern the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents to be used in the early phases of AD and the optimization of the symptomatic treatments predominantly dedicated to the more advanced AD stages. Until now. available therapeutic agents for AD treatment only provide symptomatic treatment. Since AD pathogenesis is multifactorial. use of a multimodal therapeutic intervention addressing several molecular targets of AD-related pathological processes seems to be the most practical approach to modify the course of AD progression. It has been demonstrated through numerous studies. that the clinical efficacy of combination therapy (CT) is higher than that of monotherapy. In case of AD. CT is more effective. mostly when started early. at slowing the rate of cognitive impairment. In this review. we have covered the major studies regarding CT to combat AD pathogenesis.

A hallmark of AD is the deregulation of the level of ß-amyloid (Aß) that leads to the appearance of the senile plaques that contain Aß derived from the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Among numerous risk factors for AD. genetic risk factor such as possession of ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) is considered as a crucial risk factor. Moreover. dietary fat composition has also been concerned as an important factor for AD since cholesterol and blood-brain barrier functions are linked with AD. The primary genetic risk factor is ApoE ε4 allele that encodes one of several proteins responsible for cholesterol transport and it is considered as foremost cholesterol transport proteins in the brain. For the progression of AD high level of serum/plasma cholesterol has been recommended as a causative factor. But this statement is debatable meanwhile brain cholesterol levels of AD patients are highly variable and cholesterol levels in serum/plasma and brain of AD patients do not consider cholesterol as a risk factor in AD. Indeed. APOE ε4 is neither essential nor enough for the development of AD. it only serves as a synergistic and increases the risk of AD. Another prominent feature of AD is region-specific declines in brain glucose metabolism. The brain cells are totally different from other cells of the body. the brain cells cannot competently metabolize fats. therefore completely depends on glucose as an energy substrate. Consequently. inhibition of glucose metabolism can have intense effects on the brain functions.

To counteract this pathological mechanism. exogenous antioxidants act interactively. even synergistically. with the endogenous antioxidant defense system to restore or maintain redox homeostasis [2]. For example. some phytochemicals (eg. epigallocatechin gallate. resveratrol. phytosterol. myricetin. and gingerol) directly influence the numerous pathways of molecular signal transduction (cell proliferation/migration. inflammation cascade. metabolic disorders. and oxidative stress)[3. 4]. Further. many foods in the human diet—vegetables. fruits. juices. and beverages—contain antioxidants [5. 6].

The body contains an endogenous antioxidant system to help neutralize reactive oxygen species and mitigate oxidative damage. Every living cell survives when there is a balance between the oxidative stress generated and the counter antioxidant system present. Once this harmony is disrupted. the generated stress loads on the cell and starts to exert pathological. metabolic. and degenerative effects. Antioxidants have been proven to ameliorate drug toxicity [1]. carcinogenesis [2]. and neurodegenerative processes [3. 4]. In this special issue. several articles have proposed different molecular mechanisms to mitigate oxidative stress and prevent aging. metabolic. and degenerative disorders. For example. SM Ahmed et al. searched and analyzed previous animal studies to develop a conclusive systematic review discussing the use of different types of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for the treatment of acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic fibrosis. They concluded that bone marrow and umbilical cord MSCs were the most frequently administered cell types. In addition. they did not recommend clinical trials to investigate the use of MSCs as therapy for pancreatitis due to the insufficiency of published data.In cardiovascular research. SI Khan et al. evaluated the effects of febuxostat and allopurinol on a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and concluded that febuxostat had more potent protective activities than allopurinol against IR injury by inhibiting apoptosis (MAPK) and inflammation (NF-κBp65/TNF-α) pathways.

The prevalence of this condition. associated with the physiological stage of menopause. is continuously increasing. This study evaluated the effectiveness of soy isoflavones as compared to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in low doses. on the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. by determining bone mineral density (BMD) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (D-pyr) in physiological postmenopausal women. The study was conducted over a period of 12 months. on three parallel groups. which included a total of 325 postmenopausal women (HRT group: n= 95; phytoestrogens group: n= 124; control group: n= 106). At the one-year evaluation. we observed T-score normalization in a small number of cases (5.26%. 2.42% and 0.00%. respectively). The average values of D-Pyr decreased by 11.38% in the group treated with phytoestrogens (p< 0.05) and by 15.32% in the group that followed HRT (p< 0.05); it increased by 4.38% in the control group (p> 0.05). Both therapies have beneficial effects on bone metabolism. leading to a significant decrease in the evolution of bone resorption and there are no major differences between the efficacy of HRT and phytoestrogens in terms of the effects on BMD and bone resorption.

Open Access Journal,The issue of drug disposal. as well as the development and implementation of efficient collection strategies. represents an important concern at the highest European level. This research looks into the factors that could have an impact on the efficiency of pharmacies in collecting and disposing the medicinal waste of the population. There were 521 pharmacists from all over the country who filled in a questionnaire on their opinion/attitude related to the system of collecting and disposing the pharmaceutical waste of the population. Of the surveyed pharmacists. 16% work in pharmacies that do not collect unused/expired drugs from the population. and nearly 33% of those investigated have refused. at least once. to take the unused medicines from the people. Pharmacists’ most important reasons for refusing to collect the pharmaceutical waste were the lack of procedure. incomplete legislation. exceeding the amount contracted with the operators. and high costs. Results show that pharmacies in Romania face several deficiencies in the pharmaceutical waste collection services. The lack of implemented programs has contributed considerably to lower standards of pharmaceutical waste management in Romania. This study is the first research on this topic in Romania. a country where the management of drug-based waste generated by the population is at the beginning. The results shown in this survey can provide a reference point for competent authorities in developing and implementing a take-back program for waste medicine whose efficiency is superior to the existing ones.

Remarkably. these polymeric nanocarriers could be further modified as stimuli-responsive systems based on the mechanism of triggered release. ie. response to a specific stimulus. either endogenous (pH. enzymes. temperature. redox values. hypoxia. glucose levels) or exogenous (light. magnetism. ultrasound. electrical pulses) for the effective biodistribution and controlled release of drugs or genes at specific sites. Various nanoparticles (NPs) have been functionalized and used as templates for imaging systems in the form of metallic NPs. dendrimers. polymeric NPs. quantum dots. and liposomes. The use of polymeric nanocarriers for imaging and to deliver active compounds has attracted considerable interest in various cancer therapy fields.

Energy production in cancer cells is abnormally dependent on aerobic glycolysis. In addition to the dependency on glycolysis. cancer cells have other atypical metabolic characteristics. The purpose of the present study is to evaluation and analysis of the colon cancer cells under anti-angiogenic treatment. to establish the changes in the cellular energy metabolism and apoptotic potential. Anti-angiogenic drugs block the vascular endothelial growth factors. preventing the formation of new vessels. Materials and Methods: We use immunohistochemical analysis of cytochrome c release and histoenzymatic analysis of adenosine triphosphatase (ATP-ase). succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymes. Colorectal tumor tissue samples were obtained by biopsy following the surgical procedures at the County Clinical Hospital of Oradea (Romania). Results: The obtained results show that the apoptotic potential of malignant cells increases during the anti-angiogenic treatment. in the same time the rate of glycolysis increases. due to installed hypoxia and reduced ATP synthesis. Our results have been confirmed by international studies too.

To this end. commercial multilayer discs use thermal ablation of metal films or phase change materials to realize such a threshold process. This paper addresses a threshold writing mechanism relevant to recently reported fluorescence-based data storage in dye-doped co-extruded multilayer films. To gain understanding of the essential physics. single layer spun coat films were used so that the data is easily accessible by analytical techniques. Data were written by attenuating the fluorescence using nanosecond-range exposure times from a 488 nm continuous wave laser overlapping with the single photon absorption spectrum. The threshold writing process was studied over a range of exposure times and intensities. and with different fluorescent dyes.

It is mainly composed of endothelial cells. pericytes and astrocytes that create a neurovascular unit with the adjacent neurons. Astrocytes are essential for the formation and maintenance of the BBB by providing secreted factors that lead to the adequate association between the cells of the BBB and the formation of strong tight junctions. Under neurological disorders. such as chronic cerebral ischemia. brain trauma. Epilepsy. Alzheimer and Parkinson´s Diseases. a disruption of the BBB takes place. involving a lost in the permeability of the barrier and phenotypical changes in both the endothelial cells and astrocytes. In this aspect. it has been established that the process of reactive gliosis is a common feature of astrocytes during BBB disruption. which has a detrimental effect on the barrier function and a subsequent damage in neuronal survival. In this review we discuss the implications of astrocyte functions in the protection of the BBB. and in the development of Parkinson´s disease and related disorders.

Advances in our understanding of astrocytes include new observations about their structure. organization. function and supportive actions to other cells. Although the contribution of astrocytes to the process of brain injury has not been clearly defined. it is thought that their ability to provide support to neurons after cerebral damage is critical.

1193263,Protection after stroke: cellular effectors of neurovascular unit integrity,2014,Rafael Andres Posada-Duque and George E Barreto and Gloria Patricia Cardona-Gomez,8,,,231,Frontiers,Neurological disorders are prevalent worldwide. Cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs). which account for 55% of all neurological diseases. are the leading cause of permanent disability. cognitive and motor disorders and dementia. Stroke affects the function and structure of blood-brain barrier. the loss of cerebral blood flow regulation. oxidative stress. inflammation and the loss of neural connections. Currently. no gold standard treatments are available outside the acute therapeutic window to improve outcome in stroke patients. Some promising candidate targets have been identified for the improvement of long-term recovery after stroke. such as Rho GTPases. cell adhesion proteins. kinases. and phosphatases. Previous studies by our lab indicated that Rho GTPases (Rac and RhoA) are involved in both tissue damage and survival. as these proteins are essential for the morphology and movement of neurons. astrocytes and endothelial cells. thus playing a critical role in the balance between cell survival and death. Treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of RhoA/ROCK blocks the activation of the neurodegeneration cascade. In addition. Rac and synaptic adhesion proteins (p120 catenin and N-catenin) play critical roles in protection against cerebral infarction and in recovery by supporting the neurovascular unit and cytoskeletal remodeling activity to maintain the integrity of the brain parenchyma.

The negative correlation between tobacco consumption and PD suggests that tobacco-derived compounds can be beneficial against PD. Nicotine. the more studied alkaloid derived from tobacco. is considered to be responsible for the beneficial behavioral and neurological effects of tobacco use in PD. However. several metabolites of nicotine such as cotinine also increase in the brain after nicotine administration. The effect of nicotine and some of its derivatives on dopaminergic neurons viability. neuroinflammation. and motor and memory functions. have been investigated using cellular and rodent models of PD. Current evidence shows that nicotine. and some of its derivatives diminish oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the brain and improve synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival of dopaminergic neurons.

A therapeutic strategy that may limit microgliosis is of potential interest. In this context. selective estrogen receptor modulators. such as raloxifene and tamoxifen. are known to reduce microglia activation induced by neuroinflammatory stimuli in young animals. In the present study. we have assessed whether raloxifene and tamoxifen are able to affect microglia activation after brain injury in young and aged animals in time points relevant to clinics. which is hours after brain trauma. Volume fraction of MHC-II+ microglia was estimated according to the point-counting method of Weibel within a distance of 350 μm from the lateral border of the wound. and cellular morphology was measured by fractal analysis. Two groups of animals were studied: 1) young rats. ovariectomized at 2 months of age; and 2) aged rats. ovariectomized at 18 months of age. Fifteen days after ovariectomy animals received a stab wound brain injury and the treatment with estrogenic compounds. Our findings indicate that raloxifene and tamoxifen reduced microglia activation in both young and aged animals. Although the volume fraction of reactive microglia was found lower in aged animals. this was accompanied by important changes in cell morphology. where aged microglia assume a bushier and hyperplasic aspect when compared to young microglia.

However. pharmacologic anti-angiogenesis strategies that arrest tumor progression might not be enough to eradicate tumors. Decreased anti-angiogenesis activity in single mechanism-based anti-angiogenic strategies is due to the redundancy. multiplicity. and development of compensatory mechanism by which blood vessels are remodeled. Improving anti-angiogenesis drug efficacy will require identification of broad-spectrum anti-angiogenesis targets. These strategies may have novel features. such as increased porosity. and are the result of complex interactions among endothelial cells. extracellular matrix proteins. growth factors. pericyte. and smooth muscle cells. Thus. combinations of anti-angiogenic drugs and other anticancer strategies such as chemotherapy appear essential for optimal outcome in cancer patients.

The EBV infection can increase the risk of developing certain rare cancers such as sinonasal carcinomas (SNC). That due to the powerful ability of EBV to cause mutations in the cells and make cancerous changes in the tissues. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). mainly in tumor tissues. can target different types of cells. In addition. it can cause all hallmarks of cancerous changes in the tissues which is considered as a defining feature of these pathogens. The HCMV strictly exhibits both of cellular tumor-promoting and immune-evasive strategies as well. However. the p27 (Kip1) protein. might contribute in many different signal transduction pathways and modulate the intermediate oncogenic roles in cancer. The p27 (Kip1) protein combines with cyclin E-CDK2. cyclin A-CDK2. and cyclin D1-CDK4 forming complexes. resulting in preventing their activation. Mitogenic signals that cause reduction of p27 expression allow activation and progression of CDK/cyclin in the cell cycle. The p73 is a protein related to the p53 tumor protein; it considered as tumor suppressor that is significantly involved in the regulation of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. This study aim at investigating the effect of both the HCMV and EBV infections on the gene expression of both p 27 and p73 in sinonasal carcinomas (SNC). The study involved eighteen (18) formalinfixed. paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of sinonasal carcinomas (SNC). The verificatory re-examination for histopathological samples was done.

This study investigated the antifungal properties of aqueous extracts obtained from indigenous plants that grow spontaneously in the Northern Sahara of Algeria. The activities of these plants in controlling two fungal species that belong to Fusarium genus were evaluated in an in vitro assay. Materials and Methods. Fresh aerial parts of four plant species (Artemisia herba alba. Cotula cinerea. Asphodelus tenuifolius. and Euphorbia guyoniana) were collected for the preparation of aqueous extracts. Two levels of dilution (10% and 20%) of the pure extracts were evaluated against Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium sporotrichioides. Results. The results of this study revealed that the A. herba alba. C. cinerea. A. tenuifolius. and E. guyoniana aqueous extracts are effective at both concentrations of 10% and 20% for the Fusarium mycelia growth inhibition. In particular. A. tenuifolius extract is effective against F. graminearum. whereas F. sporotrichioides mycelium growth is strongly affected by the E. guyoniana 20% extract. The phytochemical characterization of the compositions of the aqueous extracts has revealed that the presence of some chemical compounds (tannins. flavonoids. saponins. steroids. and alkaloids) is likely to be responsible for the antifungal activities sought.

This study aimed to evaluate the potential effect of TQ-PLGA-PVA nanoparticles (TQ-PLGA-PVA-NPs) on pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin in albino rats. Forty male rats were randomized into four groups. The first group served as the control group; the second and the third groups received bleomycin intratracheally. whereas the third group received TQ-PLGA-PVA-NPs after 4 weeks from bleomycin administration. The fourth group was administrated TQ-PLGA-PVA-NPs alone. The designed nanoparticles appeared around 20 nm size (10–30 nm). had a spherical shape. and had 80% encapsulation efficiency. The histological examination of rats simultaneously treated with TQ-PLGA-PVA-NPs and bleomycin revealed reduction in the thickness of the alveolar septa and improvement of the other lung structures. with the presence of lymphocytes admixed with exfoliated epithelium in a few lumina remaining.

The standardized MEACL was orally administered at different doses (250. 500. and 1000 mg/kg) to HFD-induced hyperlipidemic rats for five weeks. Serum lipid profile. body weight changes. body mass index (BMI). daily food intake. relative organ weight. and histology of the liver were evaluated. In addition. the effect of MEACL on HMG-CoA reductase and pancreatic lipase activities as well as hepatic and fecal lipids was demonstrated. MEACL supplementation reduced serum lipids in HFD-fed rats in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological scores revealed that 1000 mg/kg MEACL restored the damage to liver tissue in hyperlipidemic rats. MEACL decreased the body mass index (BMI). atherogenic index. and hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides and increased fecal cholesterol and bile acids in HFD-fed rats. Also. MEACL ameliorated lipid peroxidation and improved antioxidant defenses in the liver of HFD-fed rats. Furthermore. HMG-CoA reductase and lipase were suppressed by MEACL. In conclusion. this study shows the potential effect of MEACL to ameliorate hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress in HFD-fed rats. It prevented hepatic lipid accumulation and exerted an inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase and lipase.

The principal mechanism of its pathogenesis appears to be alterations in the microvasculature of retina as the result of hyperglycemia. The elevated concentration of blood glucose is a harbinger of numerous molecular changes. These lead to various responses that result in microangiopathy. Oxidative stress. one such response. is attributed to disruption in the homeostasis of free radical production during the various vital processes such as the electron transport chain reaction and the scavenging mechanisms designed to neutralize these damaging molecules. This imbalance has been linked to the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy. Excessive formation of free radicals influences almost all pathways involved in normal human physiology.

It is a well-identified risk factor for increased mortality due to heightened rates of heart disease. certain cancers. musculoskeletal disorders. and bacterial. protozoan and viral infections. The increasing prevalence of obesity is of concern. as conventional pathogenesis may indeed be increased in obese hosts rather than healthy hosts. especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a new disease and we do not have the luxury of cumulative data. Obesity activates the development of gene induced hypoxia and adipogenesis in obese animals. Several factors can influence obesity. for example. stress can increase the body weight by allowing people to consume high amounts of food with a higher propensity to consume palatable food. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of immune-mediated and some inflammatory-mediated diseases. including atherosclerosis and psoriasis. leading to a dampened immune response to infectious agents. leading to weaker post-infection impacts. Moreover. the obese host creates a special microenvironment for disease pathogenesis. marked by persistent low-grade inflammation. Therefore. it is advisable to sustain healthy eating habits by increasing the consumption of various plant-based and low-fat foods to protect our bodies and decrease the risk of infectious diseases. especially COVID-19.

PD is a gradually devastating neurodegenerative disorder of the neurological function marked with αsynucleinopathy affecting numerous regions of the brain-gut axis. as well as the central. enteric. and autonomic nervous system. Its etiology is a widely disputed topic. OBJECTIVE: This review emphasizes to find out the correlation among the microbial composition and the observable disturbances in the metabolites of the microbial species and its impact on the immune response. which may have a concrete implication on the occurrence. persistence and. pathophysiology of PD via the gut-brain axis. METHODS: An in-depth research and the database was developed from the available peer reviewed articles till date (March 2020) utilizing numerous search engines like PubMed. MEDLINE and. other internet sources. RESULTS: Progressively increasing shreds of evidence have proved the fact that dysbiosis in the gut microbiome plays a central role in many neurological disorders. such as PD. Indeed. a disordered microbiome-gut-brain axis in PD could be focused on gastrointestinal afflictions that manifest primarily several years prior to the diagnosis. authenticating a concept wherein the pathological pathway progresses from the intestine reaching the brain. CONCLUSION: The microbiota greatly affects the bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut via synchronized neurological. immunological. and neuroendocrine mechanisms. It can be concluded that a multitude of factors discussed in this review …,True,Q2g73-QAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC,8,https://europepmc.org/article/med/32504503,6848200594534149787,/scholar?cites=6848200594534149787,,,0,0,0

1193386,Infectious microbial diseases and host defense responses in Sydney rock oysters,2014,David A Raftos and Rhiannon Kuchel and Saleem Aladaileh and Daniel Butt,5,,,135,Frontiers,Aquaculture has long been seen as a sustainable solution to some of the world’s growing food shortages. However. experience over the past 50 years indicates that infectious diseases caused by viruses. bacteria and eukaryotes limit the productivity of aquaculture. In extreme cases. these types of infectious agents threaten the viability of entire aquaculture industries. This article describes the threats from infectious diseases in aquaculture and then focuses on one example (QX disease in Sydney rock oysters) as a case study. QX appears to be typical of many emerging diseases in aquaculture. particularly because environmental factors seem to play a crucial role in disease outbreaks. Evidence is presented that modulation of a generic subcellular stress response pathway in oysters is responsible for both resistance and susceptibility to infectious microbes.

The standardized MEACL was orally administered at different doses (250. 500. and 1000 mg/kg) to HFD-induced hyperlipidemic rats for five weeks. Serum lipid profile. body weight changes. body mass index (BMI). daily food intake. relative organ weight. and histology of the liver were evaluated. In addition. the effect of MEACL on HMG-CoA reductase and pancreatic lipase activities as well as hepatic and fecal lipids was demonstrated. MEACL supplementation reduced serum lipids in HFD-fed rats in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological scores revealed that 1000 mg/kg MEACL restored the damage to liver tissue in hyperlipidemic rats. MEACL decreased the body mass index (BMI). atherogenic index. and hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides and increased fecal cholesterol and bile acids in HFD-fed rats. Also. MEACL ameliorated lipid peroxidation and improved antioxidant defenses in the liver of HFD-fed rats. Furthermore. HMG-CoA reductase and lipase were suppressed by MEACL. In conclusion. this study shows the potential effect of MEACL to ameliorate hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress in HFD-fed rats. It prevented hepatic lipid accumulation and exerted an inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase and lipase.

Yellow asphodel (Asphodeline lutea) along with other Asphodelus species was grown at Jordan. Asphodeline lutea is an edible plant and will become a threat due to overexploitation. This investigation was headed for studying the genetic diversity within A. lutea species based on RAPD markers. Five primers gave reproducible bands and were selected for detecting the diversity. Thirty amplification profiles were obtained. seven of them were polymorphic. Jaccard’s coefficient of similarity ranged from 0.83 to 1.00 values. UPGMA cluster analysis clearly distinguished the samples and grouped them into two main groups. The results accessible in this paper revealed low genetic diversity among A. lutea individuals.

Vaccines and targeted therapeutics to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation are currently lacking. Endoribonuclease Nsp15 plays a vital role in the life cycle. including replication and transcription as well as virulence of the virus. Here. we investigated Vitamin D for its in silico potential inhibition of the binding sites of SARS-CoV-2 endoribonuclease Nsp15. In this study. we selected Remdesivir. Chloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine and Vitamin D to study the potential binding affinity with the putative binding sites of endoribonuclease Nsp15 of COVID-19. The docking study was applied to rationalize the possible interactions of the target compounds with the active site of endoribonuclease Nsp 15. Among the results. Vitamin D was found to have the highest potency with strongest interaction in terms of LBE. lowest RMSD. and lowest inhibition intensity Ki than the other standard compounds.

But ASi is limiting for Si uptake by plants. We conclude that significant plant-available Si in soil contributes to decreased Cd concentrations in wheat shoots and could be implemented in a general scheme aiming at controlling Cd concentrations in wheat.,True,HQsclGgAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,240,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389412000647,18023804011940172414,/scholar?cites=18023804011940172414,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34346223/rizwan_2012.pdf,0,0,0

We aimed to find the in vitro antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts of 16 different traditionally used medicinal plants of Nepal against 13 clinical and 2 reference bacterial species using microbroth dilution method. The evaluated plants species were found to exert a range of in vitro growth inhibitory action against the tested bacterial species. and Cynodon dactylon was found to exhibit moderate inhibitory action against 13 bacterial species including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi. and S. typhimurium. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of tested ethanolic extracts were found from 31 to >25.000 μg/mL. Notably. ethanolic extracts of Cinnamomum camphora. Curculigo orchioides. and Curcuma longa exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against S. pyogenes with a MIC of 49. 49. and 195 μg/mL. respectively; whereas chloroform fraction of Cynodon dactylon exhibited best antibacterial activity against S. aureus with a MIC of 31 μg/mL.

Neutrophils are known to be critical for clearance of S. aureus infection from the lungs and extrapulmonary organs. Therefore. we investigated whether the NLRP6 inflammasome regulates neutrophil-dependent host immunity during pulmonary S. aureus infection. Unlike their wild-type (WT) counterparts. NLRP6 knockout (KO) mice were protected against pulmonary S. aureus infection as evidenced by their higher survival rate and lower bacterial burden in the lungs and extrapulmonary organs. In addition. NLRP6 KO mice displayed increased neutrophil recruitment following infection. and when neutrophils were depleted the protective effect was lost. Furthermore. neutrophils from the KO mice demonstrated enhanced intracellular bacterial killing and increased NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production. Intriguingly. we found higher NK cell-mediated IFN-γ production in KO mouse lungs. and treatment with IFN-γ was found to enhance the bactericidal ability of WT and KO neutrophils. The NLRP6 KO mice also displayed decreased pyroptosis and necroptosis in the lungs following infection. Blocking of pyroptosis and necroptosis in WT mice resulted in increased survival. reduced bacterial burden in the lungs. and attenuated cytokine production. Taken together. these novel findings show that NLRP6 serves as a negative regulator of neutrophil-mediated host defense during Gram-positive bacterial infection in the lungs through regulating both neutrophil influx and function.

As per our observations. in Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain USA300. CS Extract (CSE) potentiates biofilm formation via the downregulation of quorum sensing regulon agr (accessory gene regulator). Since agr is a global regulator of the staphylococcal virulome. in the present manuscript we sought to identify the effects of CS exposure on staphylococcal gene expression using RNAseq. Comparative analysis of RNAseq profiles revealed the upregulation of important virulence genes encoding surface adhesins (fnbA. fnbB. clfB); and proteins involved in immune evasion such as coa (staphylocoagulase). spa (Staphylococcal protein A). and nuc (nuclease). In concurrence with the RNAseq data. we observed 1) significant upregulation of the ability of CSE-exposed USA300 to evade phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. a known function of the staphylococcal protein A and 2) two-fold higher (P< 0.001) number of CSE-exposed USA300 escaping NET-mediated killing by neutrophils as a result of CS-mediated induction of nuc.

Here. we report that acute stress leads to hair greying through fast depletion of melanocyte stem cells (MeSCs). Combining adrenalectomy. denervation. chemogenetics. cell ablation. and MeSC-specific adrenergic receptor knockout. we found that stress-induced MeSC loss is independent of immune attack or adrenal stress hormones. Rather. hair greying results from activation of the sympathetic nerves that innervate the MeSC niche. Upon stress. sympathetic nerve activation leads to burst release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. which drives quiescent MeSCs into rapid proliferation. followed by differentiation. migration. and permanent depletion from the niche.

In mice. palatal mucosa showed the region-specific keratinization pattern along antero-posterior axis. However. developmental mechanisms involved in oral mucosa differentiation with fine tuning of keratinization are not elucidated yet. To reveal this developmental mechanism. first. we conducted tissue recombination assay of the palate at E16 for 2 days which revealed that epithelial differentiation with specific localization of CK10 is modulated by mesenchymal components. Based on the results. we propose that mesenchymal signaling would determine the presumptive fate of developing palatal epithelium in spatiotemporal manner.

Methods Particle size analysis was performed on conventional 0.05% CsA (Restasis. C-CsA) and two new types of 0.05% CsA eyedrops based on a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS. SNEDDS-N and -T). Turbidometry. pH measurements and instability indices of each CsA solution were measured. DED was induced with BAC. and animals were treated with vehicle or CsA preparations. Tear volume and fluorescein staining scores were evaluated on days 7 and 14. Eyes were enucleated and subjected to IHC. TUNEL staining. periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. real-time PCR and western blotting.   Results Both SNEDDSs had lower and more uniform particle size distribution than C-CsA. and a similar optical density to phosphate-buffered saline and stable pH. in contrast to the high turbidity and unstable pH of C-CsA. Aqueous tear volume and fluorescein staining scores were improved in C-CsA- and SNEDDS-treated mice. Numbers of PAS-positive goblet cells and levels of inflammatory mediators were decreased by both C-CsA and SNEDDS. although SNEDDS resolved inflammation more effectively than C-CsA.

Most mammalian miRNAs influence biological processes. including developmental changes. tissue morphogenesis and the maintenance of tissue identity. cell growth. differentiation. apoptosis. and metabolism. The miR-206-3p has been correlated with cancer; however. developmental roles of this miRNA are unclear. In this study. we examined the expression pattern and evaluated the developmental regulation of miR-206-3p during tooth morphogenesis using ex-vivo culture method. The expression pattern of miR-206-3p was examined in the epithelium and mesenchyme of developing tooth germ with stage-specific manners. Perturbation of the expression of miR-206-3p clearly altered expression patterns of dental-development–related signaling molecules. including Axin2. Bmp2. Fgf4. Lef1 and Shh. The gene expression complemented with change in cellular events including. apoptosis and proliferation which caused altered crown and pulp morphogenesis in renal-capsule–calcified teeth. Especially. mislocalization of β-Catenin and SMAD1/5/8 were observed alongside dramatic alterations in the expression patterns of Fgf4 and Shh. Overall. our data suggest that the miR-206-3p regulate the cellular physiology during tooth morphogenesis through modulation of the Wnt. Bmp.

We applied the knocking down of Meox2 in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts to examine the osteogenic potential of Meox2. Additionally. we applied in vivo periodontitis induced experiment to reveal the possible application of Meox2 knockdown for 1 and 2 weeks in bone healing processes.

In this study. to reveal the precise developmental function of Fubp1. we examined the detailed expression pattern and developmental function of Fubp1 during tooth morphogenesis by RT-qPCR. in situ hybridization. and knock-down study using in vitro organ cultivation methods. In embryogenesis. Fubp1 is obviously expressed in the enamel organ and condensed mesenchyme. known to be important for proper tooth formation. Knocking down Fubp1 at E14 for two days. showed the altered expression patterns of tooth development related signalling molecules. including Bmps and Fgf4. In addition. transient knock-down of Fubp1 at E14 revealed changes in the localization patterns of c-Myc and cell proliferation in epithelium and mesenchyme. related with altered tooth morphogenesis. These results also showed the decreased amelogenin and dentin sialophosphoprotein expressions and disrupted enamel rod and interrod formation in one-and three-week renal transplanted teeth respectively. Thus. our results suggested that Fubp1 plays a modulating role during dentinogenesis and amelogenesis by regulating the expression pattern of signalling molecules to achieve the proper structural formation of hard tissue matrices and crown morphogenesis in mice molar development.

The LPS-induced expression of iNOS and cytokines in BV2 cells was suppressed by the constituents of Rhodiola rosea in a concentration-dependent manner. Also the expression of the proinflammatory factors iNOS. IL-1β. and TNF-α in the kidney and prefrontal cortex of brain in mice was suppressed by the oral administration of Rhodiola rosea crude extract (500 mg/kg). To determine the neuroprotective effect of constituents of Rhodiola rosea. neuronal cells were activated by L-glutamate. and neurotoxicity was analyzed. The L-glutamate-induced neurotoxicity was suppressed by the treatment with rosin but not by rosarin. The level of phosphorylated MAPK. pJNK. and pp38 was increased by L-glutamate treatment but decreased by the treatment with rosin and salidroside.

These filaments begin to emerge after eclosion and reached their maximum length from 29.4–46.6 h. The studied males were divided into three age groups. expressed as percentages of the total waxy caudal filaments length. Attraction to a sex pheromone source was significantly higher in the oldest male group (maximum filaments growth) compared with youngest one. Only the oldest male group copulated successfully; few of the younger males tested displayed’courtship’behavior towards conspecific virgin females. The calculated duration of the sexually active phase of the adult male life cycle varied among species ranging from 34.4 to 46.6 h. There were marked variations in the strength of attraction to a pheromone source according to time of day. There was a continuous decrease in sexual activity from morning to evening. Our findings reveal clear maturation periods for adult males of the seven studied species. The long immature phase of the adult male mealybug is probably also related to several physiological processes that are needed to complete male maturation. The most noticeable change is the elongation of the waxy caudal filaments. However. mating may be performed at any time ambient conditions are suitable.

However. experience shows that the efficiency of tactics such as mass trapping. mating disruption. and lure and kill may be constrained by a lack of knowledge of basic features of the life history and mating behaviour of male insects and the mechanisms involved in their interactions with pheromone sources. Unlike neotenic adult females. male mealybugs are active fliers. do not feed and live only a few days. We study the time a male mealybug invests in mate location and mating. We tested the amount of time needed for a male of the citrus mealybug. Planococcus citri (Risso) to reach sexual maturation in a Petri dish. The response of males of different ages to a synthetic pheromone and virgin females was tested. Males from three different age classes (I-up to 10 hours after eclosion; II-10-29 hours after eclosion; III-29 or more hours after eclosion) were exposed to 100 ng of pheromone or a virgin female and the occurrence of a clear response. with copulation behaviour within 30 minutes of exposure. was noted.

In the present study we found evidence of gene flow between two sympatric. genetically related scale insect species – the citrus mealybug Planococcus citri (Risso) and the vine mealybug Planococcus ficus (Signoret). These species can be distinguished by morphological. behavioral. and molecular traits. We employed the sex pheromones of the two respective species to study their different patterns of male attraction. We also used nuclear ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer 2) and mitochondrial COI (Cytochrome c oxidase sub unit 1) DNA sequences to characterize populations of the two species. in order to demonstrate the outcome of a possible gene flow between feral populations of the two species. Our results showed attraction to P. ficus pheromones of all tested populations of P. citri males but not vice versa. Furthermore. ITS2 sequences revealed the presence of ‘hybrid females’ among P. citri populations but not among those of P. ficus. ‘hybrid females’ from P. citri populations identified as P. citri females according to COI sequences. We offer two hypotheses for these results. 1) The occurrence of phenotypic and genotypic traits of P. ficus in P. citri populations may be attributed to both ancient and contemporary gene flow between their populations; and 2) we cannot rule out that an ancient sympatric speciation by which P. ficus emerged from P. citri might have led to the present situation of shared traits between these species.

IR3535 and Picaridin are widely used as insect repellents to prevent interactions between humans and many arthropods including mosquitoes. Their molecular action has only recently been studied. yielding seemingly contradictory theories including odorant-dependent inhibitory and odorant-independent excitatory activities on insect olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and odorant receptor proteins (ORs).  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we characterize the action of these repellents on two Aedes aegypti ORs.

In chemical communication systems. enantiomers can be differentially active at the physiological and behavioral levels. Only recently were enantioselective odorant receptors demonstrated in mammals while their existence in insects has remained hypothetical. Using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp of Xenopus oocytes. we show that the yellow fever mosquito.

In addition to steric constraints. chain length and degree of unsaturation play important roles in this recognition process.

CO2. lactic acid or ammonia emitted by vertebrate hosts is not only contingent on the presence of odorants in the environment. but is also influenced by the insect’s physiological state. For anautogenous mosquito species. like Ae. aegypti. newly emerged adult females neither respond to host odors nor engage in blood-feeding; the bases for these behaviors are poorly understood. Here we investigated detection of two components of an attractant blend emitted by vertebrate hosts. octenol and CO2. by female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes using electrophysiological. behavioral. and molecular approaches. An increase in sensitivity of octenol olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) was correlated with an increase in octenol-mediated attractive behavior from day 1 to day 6 post emergence. While the sensitivity of octenol ORNs was maintained through day 10. behavioral responses to octenol decreased as did the ability of females to discriminate between octenol and octenol + CO2.

Each sensillum contains one to several sensory neurons and at least three support cells; these cells arise from mitotic activities from one or a small group of defined precursor cells. Sensilla phenotypes are defined by distinct morphologies. and specificities to specific odors; these are the consequence of developmental programs expressed by associated neurons and support cells. and by selection and expression of subpopulations of olfactory genes encoding such proteins as odor receptors. odorant binding proteins. and odor degrading enzymes.   Methodology/Principal Findings We are investigating development of the olfactory epithelium of adult M. sexta. identifying events which might establish sensilla phenotypes. In the present study. antennal tissue was examined during the first three days of an 18 day development. a period when sensory mitotic activity was previously reported to occur. Each antenna develops as a cylinder with an outward facing sensory epithelium divided into approximately 80 repeat units or annuli. Mitotic proliferation of sensory cells initiated about 20–24 hrs after pupation (a.p.). in pre-existing zones of high density cells lining the proximal and distal borders of each annulus. These high density zones were observed as early as two hr. a.p.. and expanded with mitotic activity to fill the mid-annular regions by about 72 hrs a.p.

IR3535 and Picaridin are widely used as insect repellents to prevent interactions between humans and many arthropods including mosquitoes. Their molecular action has only recently been studied. yielding seemingly contradictory theories including odorant-dependent inhibitory and odorant-independent excitatory activities on insect olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and odorant receptor proteins (ORs).  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we characterize the action of these repellents on two Aedes aegypti ORs. AaOR2 and AaOR8. individually co-expressed with the common co-receptor AaOR7 in Xenopus oocytes; these ORs are respectively activated by the odors indole (AaOR2) and (R)-(−)-1-octen3-ol (AaOR8). odorants used to locate oviposition sites and host animals. In the absence of odorants. DEET activates AaOR2 but not AaOR8. while 2-U activates AaOR8 but not AaOR2; IR3535 and Picaridin do not activate these ORs. In the presence of odors. DEET strongly inhibits AaOR8 but not AaOR2. while 2-U strongly inhibits AaOR2 but not AaOR8; IR3535 and Picaridin strongly inhibit both ORs.  Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrate that repellents can act as olfactory agonists or antagonists. thus modulating OR activity. bringing concordance to conflicting models.,True,TeipzNoAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,130,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012138,5449119834999758857,/scholar?cites=5449119834999758857,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012138,0,0,0

In chemical communication systems. enantiomers can be differentially active at the physiological and behavioral levels. Only recently were enantioselective odorant receptors demonstrated in mammals while their existence in insects has remained hypothetical. Using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp of Xenopus oocytes. we show that the yellow fever mosquito.

In addition to steric constraints. chain length and degree of unsaturation play important roles in this recognition process.

Biosorption of arsenic using algae as sorbent is an interesting alternative to the conventional methods.This work shows results from biosorption of arsenic(V) by Lessonia nigrescens at pH = 2.5. 4.5 and 6.5. The adsorption of arsenic could be explained satisfactorily both by the Freundlich and the Langmuir isotherms. Maximum adsorption capacities were estimated to 45.2 mg/g (pH = 2.5). 33.3 mg/g (pH = 4.5). and 28.2 mg/g (pH = 6.5) indicating better adsorption at the lower pH. These values are high in comparison with other arsenic adsorbents reported.The sorption kinetics of arsenic by L. nigrescens could be modelled well by Lagergren’s first-order rate equation.

Monitoring and pest management actions are therefore required on a regular basis. to ensure the detection. evaluation and mitigation of potential risks to forest and public health. However. we still lack some of the basic knowledge required for relevant analyses of the risk posed by the pine processionary moth. Pest risk is defined as a combination of three components: (1) pest occurrence. which depends on the spatiotemporal dynamics of populations; (2) plant vulnerability to the pest. resulting in a certain amount of damage; and (3) the socioeconomic impact of damage. depending on the potential value of the plants damaged (Jactel et al. 2012).

Age-dependent alteration of stress tolerance can also occur in early adult life. In Drosophila melanogaster. evidence of such a decline in young adults has only been reported for thermotolerance. It is not known whether early adult life entails a general stress tolerance reduction and whether the response is peculiar to thermal traits. The present work was designed to investigate whether newly eclosed D melanogaster adults present a high tolerance to a range of biotic and abiotic insults. We found that tolerance to most of the abiotic stressors tested (desiccation. paraquat. hydrogen peroxide. deltamethrin. and malathion) was high in newly eclosed adults before dramatically declining over the next days of adult life. No clear age-related pattern was found for resistance to biotic stress (septic or fungal infection) and starvation.

We also examined the occurrence of cell-wall glycomolecules in BCs and secreted mucilage using immunofluorescence microscopy in conjunction with anti-glycan antibodies. Our data show that root tips released three populations of BCs defined as spherical. intermediate and elongated cells. The mechanism of shedding seemed to be cell morphotype-specific. The data also show that mucilage contained pectin. cellulose. extracellular DNA. histones and two hemicellulosic polysaccharides. xyloglucan and heteromannan. The latter has never been reported previously in any plant root secretions. Both hemicellulosic polysaccharides formed a dense fibrillary network embedding BCs and holding them together within the mucilage.

Fluctuating temperatures that remain within permissive temperature ranges generally improve performance.

However. no experimental data are to date available on the molecular function of GABA and the involvement of its metabolism in salt stress tolerance in higher plants. Here. we investigated the regulation of GABA metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana at the metabolite. enzymatic activity and gene transcription levels upon NaCl stress. We identified the GABA transaminase (GABA-T). the first step of GABA catabolism. as the most responsive to NaCl. We further performed a functional analysis of the corresponding gene POP2 and demonstrated that the previously isolated loss-of-function pop2-1 mutant was oversensitive to ionic stress but not to osmotic stress suggesting a specific role in salt tolerance. NaCl oversensitivity was not associated with overaccumulation of Na+ and Cl- but mutant showed a slight decrease in K+. To bring insights into POP2 function. a promoter-reporter gene strategy was used and showed that POP2 was mainly expressed in roots under control conditions and was induced in primary root apex and aerial parts of plants in response to NaCl. Additionally. GC-MS- and UPLC-based metabolite profiling revealed major changes in roots of pop2-1 mutant upon NaCl stress including accumulation of amino acids and decrease in carbohydrates content. GABA metabolism was overall up-regulated in response to NaCl in Arabidopsis. Particularly.

1193965,Survival at low temperatures in insects: what is the ecological significance of the supercooling point?,2002,D Renault and C Salin and G Vannier and P Vernon,23,,4,217-228,Cryoletters,Many freezing-intolerant insects may die during long or even brief exposures to temperatures above their supercooling point (SCP). Consequently. the real ecological value of the SCP remains ambiguous. particularly for tropical species that never experienced cold exposures. The bimodal distribution of SCP is discussed in the light of sexual dimorphism. The importance of sex in insect cold hardiness has been regularly neglected and although we admit that in some species sex may be uneasy to determine. it should be taken into account in further studies. We suggest that supercooling ability may be. at least partially. a result of adaptations to other functions unrelated to cold. including the desiccation resistance.

Even though some aspects of diapause have been well characterized. very little is known about the full range of molecular and biochemical modifications underlying diapause in non-model organisms.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we focused on the parasitic wasp. Praon volucre that exhibits a pupal diapause in response to environmental signals. System-wide metabolic changes occurring during diapause were investigated using GC-MS metabolic fingerprinting. Moreover. proteomic changes were studied in diapausing versus non-diapausing phenotypes using a combination of two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry. We found a reduction of Krebs cycle intermediates which most likely resulted from the metabolic depression. Glycolysis was galvanized. probably to favor polyols biosynthesis. Diapausing parasitoids accumulated high levels of cryoprotective polyols. especially sorbitol. A large set of proteins were modulated during diapause and these were involved in various functions such as remodeling of cytoskeleton and cuticle. stress tolerance. protein turnover. lipid metabolism and various metabolic enzymes.   Conclusions/Significance The results presented here provide some first clues about the molecular and biochemical events that characterize the diapause syndrome in aphid parasitoids.

In birds. stressful environmental conditions are known to delay the timing of breeding but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The stress hormone corticosterone appears to be a good candidate for mediating egg-laying date according to early environmental conditions and physiological state. By experimentally reducing the release of corticosterone in black-legged kittiwakes during the pre-laying period. we tested whether egg-laying date was mechanistically linked to corticosterone levels. Male and female kittiwakes were implanted with a low dose of exogenous corticosterone to inhibit endogenous corticosterone production. According to our predictions. the experimental reduction of corticosterone release was paralleled by a significant advancement of egg laying in females (around 4 days earlier).

In long lived species hormonal secretion varies with age; therefore. Hg-induced endocrine disruption may be exacerbated in some age classes. Here we investigated relationships between blood total Hg and luteinizing hormone (LH. a key pituitary hormone for the onset of breeding). in pre-laying known-age (11–45 years old) snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) from Adélie Land. Antarctica. We predicted that 1) blood Hg would increase with advancing age as a consequence of bio-accumulation; and that 2) increasing blood Hg would be related to decreased concentrations of LH in the most Hg-contaminated individuals. Hg concentrations were higher in females than in males (p<0.001). and contrary to our prediction. decreased with advancing age in males (p = 0.009) and tended to do so in females (p = 0.06). The analysis of stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) suggested that this unexpected pattern could originate from age and sex-related variations in trophic niche. and hence Hg exposure. Regarding LH. our prediction was only supported in young birds (≤23 years) where baseline LH was inversely correlated with Hg concentrations (p = 0.04). Hg burden did not predict baseline LH or GnRH-induced LH in birds that were more than 23 years old.

Since young and/or very old snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) commonly skip breeding. we tested whether they are physiologically able to breed during the pre-laying stage. To do so. we measured the ability of known-age (11–45 years old) petrels to release luteinizing hormone (LH. a crucial driver for breeding). by injecting exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Although young petrels exhibited low baseline LH levels. they were able to elevate LH levels after a GnRH challenge. Moreover. young and very old petrels showed a stronger decrease in LH levels after the 10 min post-GnRH injection compared with middle-aged petrels. Birds that skipped breeding were as able as breeders to release LH after a GnRH challenge. indicating that they had functional pituitaries.

We have assessed whether a marker of plasma oxidative stress (TBARS) and plasma haptoglobin (protein of the acute inflammatory phase response) measured at time t predict five demographic parameters (survival rate. return rate to the breeding colony. breeding probability. hatching and fledging success) in sexually mature wandering albatrosses over the next four years (Diomedea exulans) using a five-year individual-based dataset. Non-breeder males. but not females. having higher TBARS at time t had reduced future breeding probabilities; haptoglobin was not related to breeding probability. Neither TBARS nor haptoglobin predicted future hatching or fledging success. Haptoglobin had a marginally positive effect on female survival rate. while TBARS had a marginally negative effect on return rate. Our findings do not support the role for oxidative stress as a constraint of future reproductive success in the albatross.
