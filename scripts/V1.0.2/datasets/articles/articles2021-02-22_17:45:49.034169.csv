1045093,A renaissance in RNA synthetic biology: new mechanisms. applications and tools for the future,2015,James Chappell and Kyle E Watters and Melissa K Takahashi and Julius B Lucks,28,,,47-56,Elsevier Current Trends,Since our ability to engineer biological systems is directly related to our ability to control gene expression. a central focus of synthetic biology has been to develop programmable genetic regulatory systems. Researchers are increasingly turning to RNA regulators for this task because of their versatility. and the emergence of new powerful RNA design principles. Here we review advances that are transforming the way we use RNAs to engineer biological systems. First. we examine new designable RNA mechanisms that are enabling large libraries of regulators with protein-like dynamic ranges. Next. we review emerging applications. from RNA genetic circuits to molecular diagnostics.

However. little work has been done to examine the effects of library preparation and sequencing on the measured chemical probe reactivities that encode RNA structural information. Here. we present the first analysis and optimization of these effects for selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq). We first optimize SHAPE-Seq. and show that it provides highly reproducible reactivity data over a wide range of RNA structural contexts with no apparent biases.

During cotranscriptional folding. interactions between nascent RNAs and ligands are able to direct the formation of alternative RNA structures. a feature exploited by noncoding RNAs called riboswitches to make gene-regulatory decisions. Despite their importance. cotranscriptional folding pathways have yet to be uncovered with sufficient resolution to reveal how cotranscriptional folding governs RNA structure and function. To access cotranscriptional folding at nucleotide resolution. we extended selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer-extension sequencing (SHAPE-seq) to measure structural information of nascent RNAs during transcription.

A central goal of molecular and synthetic biology is to uncover design principles linking RNA structure to function to understand and engineer this relationship. Here we report a simple. high-throughput method called in-cell SHAPE-Seq that combines in-cell probing of RNA structure with a measurement of gene expression to simultaneously characterize RNA structure and function in bacterial cells. We use in-cell SHAPE-Seq to study the structure–function relationship of two RNA mechanisms that regulate translation in Escherichia coli.

Essential to realizing this promise is the development of strategies and tools to reliably and predictably control and characterize sophisticated patterns of gene expression. Here we review the role that RNA can play towards this goal and make a case for why this versatile. designable. and increasingly characterizable molecule is one of the most powerful substrates for engineering gene expression at our disposal.

Their enzymes are active at cold temperatures by being structurally more flexible than mesophilic enzymes. Even though. there are some indications of the possible structural mechanisms by which psychrophilic enzymes are catalytic active at cold temperatures. there is not a generalized structural property common to all psychrophilic enzymes. We examine twenty homologous enzyme pairs from psychrophiles and mesophiles to investigate flexibility as a key characteristic for cold adaptation. B-factors in protein X-ray structures are one way to measure flexibility. Comparing psychrophilic to mesophilic protein B-factors reveals that psychrophilic enzymes are more flexible in 5-turn and strand secondary structures. Enzyme cavities. identified using CASTp at various probe sizes. indicate that psychrophilic enzymes have larger average cavity sizes at probe radii of 1.4-1.5 Å. sufficient for water molecules. Furthermore. amino acid side chains lining these cavities show an increased frequency of acidic groups in psychrophilic enzymes. These findings suggest that embedded water molecules may play a significant role in cavity flexibility. and therefore. overall protein flexibility.

RNA transcriptional repressors derived from natural mechanisms called attenuators are particularly versatile. though their mechanistic complexity has made them difficult to engineer. Here we identify a new structure–function design principle for attenuators that enables the forward engineering of new RNA transcriptional repressors. Using in-cell SHAPE-Seq to characterize the structures of attenuator variants within Escherichia coli. we show that attenuator hairpins that facilitate interaction with antisense RNAs require interior loops for proper function.

SHAPE reagents covalently modify RNAs in a structure-dependent manner to create adducts at the 2′-OH group of the ribose backbone at nucleotides that are structurally flexible. The positions of these adducts are detected using reverse transcriptase (RT) primer extension. which stops one nucleotide before the modification. to create a pool of cDNAs whose lengths reflect the location of SHAPE modification.

Although rapid pathogen-identification (ID) tests are being developed. gold-standard antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) remains unacceptably slow (1–2 d). and innovative approaches for rapid phenotypic ASTs for CREs are urgently needed. Motivated by this need. in this manuscript we tested the hypothesis that upon treatment with β-lactam antibiotics. susceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates would become sufficiently permeabilized. making some of their DNA accessible to added polymerase and primers. Further. we hypothesized that this accessible DNA would be detectable directly by isothermal amplification methods that do not fully lyse bacterial cells. We build on these results to develop the polymerase-accessibility AST (pol-aAST). a new phenotypic approach for β-lactams. the major antibiotic class for gram-negative infections. We test isolates of the 3 causative pathogens of CRE infections using ceftriaxone (CRO). ertapenem (ETP). and meropenem (MEM) and demonstrate agreement with gold-standard AST. Importantly. pol-aAST correctly categorized resistant isolates that are undetectable by current genotypic methods (negative for β-lactamase genes or lacking predictive genotypes). We also test contrived and clinical urine samples. We show that the pol-aAST can be performed in 30 min sample-to-answer using contrived urine samples and has the potential to be performed directly on clinical urine specimens.,True,RF5PJG0AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,4,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000652,811101636478611700,/scholar?cites=811101636478611700,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000652,0,0,0

Detection of nucleic acids in genotypic AST can be rapid. but it has not been successful for β-lactams (the largest antibiotic class used to treat Ng). Rapid phenotypic AST for Ng is challenged by the pathogen’s slow doubling time and the lack of methods to quickly quantify the pathogen’s response to β-lactams. Here. we asked two questions: (1) Is it possible to use nucleic acid quantification to measure the β-lactam susceptibility phenotype of Ng very rapidly. using antibiotic-exposure times much shorter than the 1- to 2-h doubling time of Ng? (2) Would such short-term antibiotic exposures predict the antibiotic resistance profile of Ng measured by plate growth assays over multiple days? To answer these questions. we devised an innovative approach for performing a rapid phenotypic AST that measures DNA accessibility to exogenous nucleases after exposure to β-lactams (termed nuclease-accessibility AST [nuc-aAST]). We showed that DNA in antibiotic-susceptible cells has increased accessibility upon exposure to β-lactams and that a judiciously chosen surfactant permeabilized the outer membrane and enhanced this effect. We tested penicillin. cefixime. and ceftriaxone and found good agreement between the results of the nuc-aAST after 15–30 min of antibiotic exposure and the results of the gold-standard culture-based AST measured over days.

1045137,Evaluation of phenotype stability and ecological risk of a genetically engineered alga in,2017,SJ Szyjka and S Mandal and NG Schoepp,,,,,,Genetically engineered (GE) algae offer the promise of producing food. fuel. and other valuable products with reduced requirements for land and fresh water. While the gains in productivity measured in GE terrestrial crops are predicted to be mirrored in GE algae. the stability of phenotypes and ecological risks posed by GE algae in large-scale outdoor cultivation remain unknown. Here. we describe the first US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-sanctioned experiment aimed at understanding how GE algae perform in outdoor cultivation. Acutodesmus dimorphus was genetically engineered by the addition of two genes. one for enhanced fatty acid biosynthesis. and one for recombinant green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression; both the genes and their associated phenotypes were maintained during fifty days of outdoor cultivation. We also observed that while the GE algae dispersed from the cultivation ponds. colonization of the trap ponds by the GE strain declined rapidly with increasing distance from the source cultivation ponds. In contrast. many species of indigenous algae were found in every trap pond within a few days of starting the experiment. When inoculated in water from five local lakes. the GE algae's effect on biodiversity. species composition. and biomass of native algae was indiscernible from those of the wild-type (wt) progenitor algae. and neither the GE nor wt algae were able to outcompete native strains. We conclude that GE algae can be successfully cultivated outdoors while maintaining GE traits. and that for the specific GE algal strain tested here they did not outcompete or adversely impact native algae populations …,True,RF5PJG0AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/188328728.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/188328728.pdf,0,0,0

1045157,Development and application of quantitative proteomic strategy for kinase substrate screening,2013,Liang Xue,,,,,,Protein kinases are implicated in multiple diseases such as cancer. diabetes. cardiovascular diseases. and central nervous system disorders. Identification of kinase substrates is critical to dissecting signaling pathways and to understanding disease pathologies. However. methods and techniques used to identify bona fide kinase substrates have remained elusive. I have been developing an integrated proteomic strategy. termed kinase assay linked with phosphoproteomics (KALIP). which combines a sensitive kinase reaction with endogenous kinase-dependent phosphoproteomics to identify direct substrates of protein kinases. The in vitro kinase reaction in the first designed version of KALIP is carried out using a pool of peptides derived directly from cellular kinase substrates and then dephosphorylated as substrate candidates. The resulting newly phosphorylated peptides are then isolated and identified by mass …,True,8WiYcn4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://search.proquest.com/openview/2e3d4ae75f79a912d580996bcd88ea8b/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y,,,,,0,0,0

The model is amenable to detailed mathematical analysis and gives insight on the mechanisms through which antigen availability controls the rate of maturation and the expansion of the antibody population.

We have synthesized a series of push–pull-substituted o-phenylene oligomers (dimethylamino/nitro) up to the octamer. Conformational analysis of the hexamer using a combination of low-temperature NMR spectroscopy and ab initio predictions of 1H NMR chemical shifts indicates that. like other o-phenylenes. they exist as compact helices in solution. However. the substituents are found to have a significant effect on their conformational behavior: the nitro-functionalized terminus is 3-fold more likely to twist out of the helix. Protonation of the dimethylamino group favors the helical conformer.

However. by first planarizing the ends. a target tetrabenzanthanthrene has been obtained by oxidation in good yield. DFT calculations suggest that the larger polycyclic aromatic subunits of the preplanarized substrate increase the rate of planarization relative to that of rearrangement. By implication. it may be possible to prepare graphene structures that cannot be made directly from simple polyphenylenes by instead designing precursors with larger polycyclic aromatic moieties.

At the same time. the seed’s sink strength plays an important role in dry matter accumulation. To investigate the relative contribution of pearl millet flag leaves to protein. micronutrient (Fe and Zn) and phytate accumulation. a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of flag leaf removal on grain test weight (1000 grain weight). protein. micronutrients (Fe and Zn) and Phytate deposition in developing grains of two pearl millet cultivars viz. HC 20 and WHC 901-445. Flag leaf was removed on anthesis. Major effect of flag leaf removal was observed on test weight and protein content. A reduction of 10-12 % in test weight and 4-6 % in protein content was recorded in flag leaf removed plants than that of control plants. No significant reduction was observed in both the micronutrients (Fe and Zn). while phytate content behaved cultivar specific. a significant reduction was observed in HC 20 while it was unaffected in WHC 901-445.

To determine the proinflammatory effects. cellular oxidative stress and expression of genes encoding for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and adhesion molecules. such as E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). were assessed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to 2.2′.4.6.6′-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 104). a representative of ortho-substituted. non-coplanar PCB …,True,opn6dk4AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,90,https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article-abstract/75/1/47/1696232,17378718662318443203,/scholar?cites=17378718662318443203,,https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/75/1/47/1696232,0,0,0

Epithelia lacking this tight junction scaffolding protein form cysts with multiple lumens and are defective in the earliest phases of polarization. both in two and three dimensions.

Although a polarized cytoskeleton is critical for Bazooka positioning. proteins mediating this remained unknown. We found that the small GTPase Rap1 and the actin-junctional linker Canoe/afadin are essential for polarity establishment. as both adherens junctions and Bazooka are mispositioned in their absence.

Translation of G0S2 results in a small basic protein of 103 amino acids in size. It was initially believed that G0S2 mediates re-entry of cells from the G0 to G1 phase of the cell cycle. Recent studies have begun to reveal the functional aspects of G0S2 and its protein product in various cellular settings. To date the best-known function of G0S2 is its direct inhibitory capacity on the rate-limiting lipolytic enzyme adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Other studies have illustrated key features of G0S2 including sub-cellular localization. expression profiles and regulation. and possible functions in cellular proliferation and differentiation.

Recent findings suggest a strong relationship between autophagy and lipid turnover. Here. we explore the effect of 3‐MA on adipocyte lipolysis.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Assays were performed in 3T3‐L1 cells. Cells were treated with 3‐MA and wortmannin. a pan PI3K and autophagy inhibitor. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of endogenous autophagic and lipolytic pathways was used to ascertain the contribution of 3‐MA to the observed effects on lipolysis.KEY RESULTS 3T3‐L1 cells that were exposed to 3‐MA showed a consistent increase in lipolysis. approximately 50% over basal levels. The effect of 3‐MA was not secondary to autophagic inhibition as treatment of 3T3‐L1 cells with wortmannin yielded no such changes.

The precise mechanisms by which ATGL action is regulated by lipid droplet (LD) coat proteins and responds to hormonal stimulation are incompletely defined. By combining usage of loss- and gain-of-function approaches. we sought to determine the respective roles of perilipin 1 and fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27) in the control of ATGL-mediated lipolysis in adipocytes. Knockdown of endogenous perilipin 1 expression resulted in elevated basal lipolysis that was less responsive to β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. In comparison. depletion of FSP27 protein increased both basal and stimulated lipolysis with no significant impact on the overall response of cells to isoproterenol.

The G0/G1 Switch Gene 2 (G0S2) was recently identified as the major selective inhibitor of ATGL and its hydrolase function. Since G0S2 levels are dynamically linked and rapidly responsive to nutrient status or metabolic requirements. the identification of its regulation at the protein level is of significant value. Earlier evidence from our laboratory demonstrated that G0S2 is a short-lived protein degraded through the proteasomal pathway. However. little is currently known regarding the underlying mechanisms. In the current study we find that 1) protein degradation is initiated by K48-linked polyubiquitination of the lysine- 25 in G0S2; and 2) G0S2 protein is stabilized in response to ATGL expression and TG accumulation. Mutation of lysine-25 of G0S2 abolished ubiquitination and increased protein stability. More importantly. G0S2 was stabilized via different mechanisms in the presence of ATGL vs. in response to fatty acid (FA)-induced TG accumulation. Furthermore. G0S2 protein but not mRNA levels were reduced in the adipose tissue of ATGL-deficient mice. corroborating the involvement of ATGL in the stabilization of G0S2.

Recent studies show that adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) act sequentially in catalyzing the first two steps of adipose lipolysis in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. Here we sought to determine their functional roles in TNF-α-induced lipolysis. Silencing of ATGL expression in adipocytes almost completely abolished basal and TNF-α-induced glycerol release. In comparison. the glycerol release under the same conditions was only partially decreased upon reduction in expression of either HSL or CGI-58. a coactivator of ATGL. Interestingly. overexpression of ATGL restored the lipolytic rates in cells with silenced HSL or CGI-58. indicating a predominant role for ATGL. While expression of ATGL. HSL and CGI-58 remains mostly unaffected …,True,wusR0lcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6706256279725853410&hl=en&oi=scholarr,6706256279725853410,/scholar?cites=6706256279725853410,,,0,0,0

1045469,Muscle fibre growth and quality in fish,2006,Anders Kiessling and Kari Ruohonen and Marit Bjørnevik,,,,,Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology,Striated muscle in fish is in parity with skeletal muscle in higher vertebrates made up of three major compartments-contractile proteins. lipids. and connective tissue.-all affecting the product and food quality of the muscle as meat. The most striking difference between striated fish muscle and that found in higher vertebrates is the separation of fibre types in to discrete layers in fish. where the high glycolytic and anaerobic type (Fast-White fibres) dominates constituting 90-95% of all muscle in most fish species. Red muscle fibres are commonly confined to a narrow strip along the lateral line and constitute less then 10% of the myotomal musculature. Intermediate or pink fibres are in accordance to their name not only intermediate in position between red and white muscle fibres but also in many other aspects. Salmonids seem not to have pink fibres. In contrast to other higher vertebrates in the majority of fish species growth continues through out life and the growth of muscle is the combined effect of formation of more muscle cells (fibres) and increase in size of already existing fibres. In spite of the apparent large connective tissue compartment of fish muscle. only 2-3% of the protein is found here. All the above factors are believed to be in part under genetic control. but a gene x environment interaction seems to be evident.

Everyone has an opinion about what tastes good. People also associate safe food with quality. Scientists prefer to deal with objective criteria and properties that can be measured and evaluated. but such criteria are not always relevant for consumers and their taste experiences. Cooks. who in their daily lives transform raw materials into tasty meals. acquire a great deal of experience with the way differences in raw materials affect the end results of their labours. When a structured quality researcher who wishes to document differences meets a chef who may well be emotionally involved in his work. bridges can be built between research data and consumer experience.

Electron transfer from CPR to cyt c has been extensively used as a model reaction to assess the redox activity of CPR. CPR is composed of multiple domains. among which the FMN binding domain (FBD) is the direct electron donor to cyt c. Here. electron transfer and complex formation between FBD and cyt c are investigated. Electron transfer from FBD to cyt c occurs at distinct rates that are dependent on the redox states of FBD. When compared with full-length CPR. FBD reduces cyt c at a higher rate in both the semiquinone and hydroquinone states.

These molecules. called autoinducers. are classified as intraspecies (ie.. molecules produced and perceived by the same bacterial species) or interspecies (molecules that are produced and sensed between different bacterial species). AI-2 has been proposed as an interspecies autoinducer and has been shown to regulate different bacterial physiology as well as affect virulence factor production and biofilm formation in some bacteria. including bacteria of clinical relevance. Several groups have embarked on the development of small molecules that could be used to perturb AI-2 signaling in bacteria. with the ultimate goal that these molecules could be used to inhibit bacterial virulence and biofilm formation.

Platensimycin (PL) is a new promising antibiotic whose biosynthetic production is costly. Six dialkylamine analogs of PL were synthesized with identical pharmacophores but different side chains; five of them were found inactive. To address the possibility that their activity is limited by the permeation step. we calculated polarity. measured surface activity and the ability to insert into the phospholipid monolayers. The partitioning of PL and the analogs into the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli was assessed by activation curve shifts of a re-engineered mechanosensitive channel. MscS. in patch-clamp experiments. Despite predicted differences in polarity. the affinities to lipid monolayers and native membranes were comparable for most of the analogs. For PL and the di-myrtenyl analog QD-11. both carrying bulky sidechains. the affinity for the native membrane was lower than for monolayers (half-membranes). signifying that intercalation must overcome the lateral pressure of the bilayer. We conclude that the biological activity among the studied PL analogs is unlikely to be limited by their membrane permeability.

The essential oil extracted by hydro distillation method was evaluated by GC-MS for its bioactive compounds. Male C57BL/6 mice were injected with B16F-10 melanoma cells through tail vein and simultaneously treated with the essential oil of Wedelia chinensis (Osbeck). The selected dose of drug (50 µg of essential oil) showed its cytotoxicity on B16 F-10 melanoma cell line with 65.17% of death within 24hrs in-vitro. We observed a statistically significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in essential oil treated group when compared with the normal and cancer control groups. We have also observed an increased level of expression of apoptosis inducing molecules such as p53 and caspase-3 in treated group when compared to cancer group as an indicator of utilization of such molecules for inducing apoptosis. The present investigations indicate the effect of essential oil of Wedelia chinensis (Osbeck) in suppressing the metastatic potential of B16F-10 cells in lungs as well as tumor directed angiogenesis. It has shown a powerful apoptotic effect by increasing the levels of p53 and caspase-3 enhancing apoptotic nuclei and thereby it inhibits cancer progress.

Here. we provide evidence that PKP2 governs DP assembly dynamics by scaffolding a DP–PKP2–protein kinase Cα (PKCα) complex. which is disrupted by PKP2 knockdown. The behavior of a phosphorylation-deficient DP mutant that associates more tightly with IF is mimicked by PKP2 and PKCα knockdown and PKC pharmacological inhibition. all of which impair junction assembly.

Although considered the ‘toughest’ cytoskeletal fibers. studies in cultured cells have revealed that IF can be surprisingly dynamic and highly regulated. This review examines the diversity of IF assembly behaviors. and considers the ideas that IF proteins are co- or post-translationally assembled into oligomeric precursors. which can be delivered to different subcellular compartments by microtubules or actomyosin and associated motor proteins. Their interaction with other cellular elements via IF associated proteins (IFAPs) affects IF dynamics and also results in cellular networks with properties that transcend those of individual components.

Here we show that Sam68 is critical for genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation in the γ-irradiated colon and animal and that Sam68-dependent NF-κB activation provides radioprotection to colon epithelium in vivo. Sam68 deletion diminishes γ-irradiation-triggered PAR synthesis and NF-κB activation in colon epithelial cells (CECs). thus hampering the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules in situ and facilitating CECs to undergo apoptosis in mice post whole-body γ-irradiation (WBIR). Sam68 knockout mice suffer more severe damage in the colon and succumb more rapidly from acute radiotoxicity than the control mice following WBIR. Our results underscore the critical role of Sam68 in orchestrating genotoxic stress-initiated NF-κB activation signaling in the colon tissue and whole animal and reveal the pathophysiological relevance of Sam68-dependent NF-κB activation in colonic cell survival and recovery from extrinsic DNA damage.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21957.001,True,IAt5VuAAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC,5,https://elifesciences.org/articles/21957,18399835146213151846,/scholar?cites=18399835146213151846,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/21957.pdf,0,0,0

We have previously reported that the genetic loss of K17 is sufficient to delay tumor onset in two distinct mouse models for spontaneous skin tumorigenesis (Gli2 tg. BCC-like; HPV16 tg. SCC-like).

Schlichthaerle and J. Cox and R. Jungmann and F.U. Hartl,,Science,,,Science,Cells have evolved quality control mechanisms that operate under normal growth conditions and during stress to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and prevent the formation of potentially toxic aggregates. Research in recent decades has identified complex quality control systems in the cytoplasm that mediate protein folding. prevent misfolding. and cooperate in protein degradation with the proteasome and autophagy pathways. Compartment-specific proteostasis networks and stress response pathways have also been described for the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. In contrast. relatively little is known about protein quality control in the nucleus.Proteins enter the nucleus in a folded state. so chaperone machinery specific for de novo folding is not required. However. the nuclear proteome is rich in stress-sensitive. metastable proteins. which suggests that effective protein quality …,True,p72Q3OgAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC,101,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6451/342.abstract,18211486494584363012,/scholar?cites=18211486494584363012,,https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3148943/component/file_3148994/content,0,0,0

Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry‐based proteomics to monitor the dynamics of BCR signaling complexes (signalosomes) and to investigate the dynamics of downstream phosphorylation and ubiquitylation signaling. We identify most of the previously known components of BCR signaling. as well as many proteins that have not yet been implicated in this system. BCR activation leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of the receptor‐proximal signaling components. many of which are co‐regulated by both the modifications.

We find that perturbation of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) in humans elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are detected by peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2). In the oligomeric state. PRDX2 forms a replisome-associated ROS sensor. which binds the fork accelerator TIMELESS when exposed to low levels of ROS. Elevated ROS levels generated by RNR attenuation disrupt oligomerized PRDX2 to smaller subunits. whose dissociation from chromatin enforces the displacement of TIMELESS from the replisome. This process instantly slows replication fork progression. which mitigates pathological consequences of replication stress. Thus. redox signaling couples fluctuations of dNTP biogenesis with replisome activity to reduce stress during genome duplication.

However. the stoichiometry of acetylation remains poorly characterized. and is important for understanding acetylation-dependent mechanisms of protein regulation. Here we provide accurate. validated measurements of acetylation stoichiometry at 6829 sites on 2535 proteins in human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. Most acetylation occurs at very low stoichiometry (median 0.02%). whereas high stoichiometry acetylation (> 1%) occurs on nuclear proteins involved in gene transcription and on acetyltransferases. Analysis of acetylation copy numbers show that histones harbor the majority of acetylated lysine residues in human cells.

1045765,Review on bile acid analysis,2012,Kirti Rani Sharma,3,Int. J. Pharm. Biomed. Sci,2,28-34,,Bile acids are made in the liver by the cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol. They are conjugated with taurine or the amino acid glycine. or with a sulfate or a glucuronide. and are then stored in the gallbladder. which concentrates the salts by removing the water. Bile acids serve other functions. including eliminating cholesterol from the body. driving the flow of bile to eliminate catabolites from the liver. emulsifying lipids and fat-soluble vitamins in the intestine to form micelles that can be transported via the lacteal system. and aiding in the reduction of the bacteria flora found in the small intestine and biliary tract. Conjugated bile acids are more efficient at emulsifying fats because. at intestinal pH. they are more ionized than unconjugated bile acids. Several assays have been used to determine both total and individual bile acids in biological fluids. The methods that have been used specifically to analyze serum TBA (total Bile Acid) are gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). enzymatic assays and enzyme cycling assays. GLC and HPLC methods are not commonly used in clinical laboratories where automated clinical chemistry analyzers are used for most of chemistry tests including TBA testing. The enzymatic assay is now mainly used in small laboratories where TBA test are in lyophilized powder form and manual reconstitution steps are needed before use.

This property of β-Amylase has wide applications in food. pharmaceutical. paper. leather. detergent and textile industries too. In present work. Glycine max β-Amylase was entrapped by emulsification and through covalent coupling by glutaraldehyde which is an excellent cross linking agent. Biodegradation of emulsified entrapped Glycine max β-Amylase into chemically modified bovine serum albuminwas carried out by the alkaline protease which is proteolytic enzyme. Successful sustained release of bound enzyme from emulsified chemically modified bovine serum albumin widens its applications by increased stability and sustained usablity. Starch forms a major constituent of foods and is major component of stains during spilling of foods on cloths. Further. this emulsified entrapped Glycine max β-Amylase into chemically modified bovine serum albumin along with alkaline protease were used in detergents that work on starchy stains on stained cloths that lead to vanish of these strains and clear them by digesting starch during washing.,True,sMN8F5QAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC,24,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kirti_Rani2/publication/265864917_Emulsified_entrapment_of_Glycine_max_amylase_into_chemically_modified_bovine_serum_albumin_and_study_its_applications_in_detergents/links/54e1deb60cf2953c22bb7d47.pdf,4751259877168935783,/scholar?cites=4751259877168935783,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kirti_Rani2/publication/265864917_Emulsified_entrapment_of_Glycine_max_amylase_into_chemically_modified_bovine_serum_albumin_and_study_its_applications_in_detergents/links/54e1deb60cf2953c22bb7d47.pdf,0,0,0

The results show that folding proceeds through distinct intermediates in a stepwise pathway that sequentially incorporates cooperative native-like structural elements to build the native protein. Each step is seen as a concerted transition of one or more segments from an HX-unprotected to an HX-protected state. Deconvolution of the data to near amino acid resolution shows that each step corresponds to the folding of a secondary structural element of the native protein. termed a “foldon.” Each folded segment is retained through subsequent steps of foldon addition. revealing a stepwise buildup of the native structure via a single dominant pathway.

A persistent problem is the degradation of HX information due to back exchange of deuterium label during the fragmentation-separation process needed to prepare samples for MS measurement. This paper reports a systematic analysis of the factors that influence back exchange (solution pH. ionic strength. desolvation temperature. LC column interaction. flow rates. system volume). The many peptides exhibit a range of back exchange due to intrinsic amino acid HX rate differences. Accordingly. large back exchange leads to large variability in D-recovery from one residue to another as well as one peptide to another that cannot be corrected for by reference to any single peptide-level measurement.

Computational prediction of such a self-association behavior is advantageous early during mab drug candidate selection when material availability is limited. Here. we present a coarse-grained (CG) simulation method that enables microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of full-length antibodies at high concentrations. The proposed approach differs from others in two ways: first. charges are assigned to CG beads in an effort to reproduce molecular multipole moments and charge asymmetry of full-length antibodies instead of only localized charges. This leads to great improvements in the agreement between CG and all-atom electrostatic fields. Second. the distinctive hydrophobic character of each antibody is incorporated through empirical adjustments …,True,09384AYAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,3,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349520303453,209643796195898331,/scholar?cites=209643796195898331,,,0,0,0

Administrative control over financial and export economy by the British since the establishment of the Federal Council in 1909 is in fact contrary to the British practice of free trade in the 19th century. By controlling Federal Council. British has succeeded to collect surplus balance to credit until 1913. The period between 1909 to 1913 show that before the World War I. Federated Malay States possess a higher surplus balance to credit. Therefore. the objective of this study is to investigate the formation of a trading system in the Federated Malay States by the British since the establishment of the Federal Council until the outbreak of World War I. The study found that the most important elements that effect mercantilism trading system in the Federated Malay States is the intervention of the Chief Secretary through the provisions of the law by the Federal Council.

In this study. we report the purification and characterization of an exopolysaccharide EPS273 from the culture supernatant of marine bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri 273. The exopolysaccharide EPS273 not only effectively inhibits biofilm formation but also disperses preformed biofilm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. High performance liquid chromatography traces of the hydrolyzed polysaccharides shows that EPS273 primarily consists of glucosamine. rhamnose. glucose and mannose. Further investigation demonstrates that EPS273 reduces the production of the virulence factors pyocyanin. exoprotease and rhamnolipid. and the virulence of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to human lung cells A549 and zebrafish embryos is also obviously attenuated by EPS273. In addition. EPS273 also greatly reduces the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and extracellular DNA (eDNA). which are important factors for biofilm formation. Furthermore. EPS273 exhibits strong antioxidant potential by quenching hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals. Notably. the antibiofouling activity of EPS273 is observed in the marine environment up to two weeks according to the amounts of bacteria and diatoms in the glass slides submerged in the ocean.

The HCV core protein has been shown to bind to DDX3X both in vitro and in vivo. However. the specific interactions between these two proteins and the functional importance of these interactions for the HCV viral life cycle remain unclear. We show that amino acids 16–36 near the N-terminus of the HCV core protein interact specifically with DDX3X both in vitro and in vivo. Replication of HCV replicon NNeo/C-5B RNA (genotype 1b) is significantly suppressed in HuH-7-derived cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions to HCV core protein residues 16–36. but not by GFP fusions to core protein residues 16–35 or 16–34. Notably. the inhibition of HCV replication due to expression of the GFP fusion to HCV core protein residues 16–36 can be reversed by overexpression of DDX3X.

Moreover. transcriptome analyses revealed that increasing concentration of Ca2+ induced KEGG pathways including quorum sensing (QS) in B. lines BS258. Notably. most up-regulated genes related to QS were found to encode peptide/nickel ABC transporters. which suggested that nickel uptake and its associated urease stimulation were essential to boost CaCO3 biomineralization. Within the genome of B. lines BS258. there are both cadmium and lead resistance gene clusters. Therefore. the sequestration abilities of Cd2+ and Pb2+ by B. lines BS258 were checked. Consistently. Pb2+ and Cd2+ could be effectively sequestered with the precipitation of calcite by B. lines BS258.

However. the genetic and physiological adaptations of bacteria to mercury stress still remains unclear. Here. we show that the marine bacterium P. stutzeri 273 is resistant to 50 µM Hg2+ and removes up to 94% Hg2+ from culture. Using gene homologous recombination and complementation. we show that genes encoding Hg2+-transport proteins MerT. MerP. the mercuric reductase MerA and the regulatory protein MerD. but not mer regulator MerR. are essential for bacterial mercuric resistance when challenged with Hg2+. Further. mercury stress inhibits flagellar development. motility. chemotaxis and biofilm formation of P. stutzeri 273. which are verified by transcriptomic and physiological analyses. Surprisingly. we discover that MerF. a previously reported Hg2+-transporter. determines flagellar development. motility and biofilm formation in P. stutzeri 273 by genetic and physiological analyses. Our results strongly indicate that MerF plays an integral role in P. stutzeri 273 to develop physiological responses to mercury stress. Notably. MerF homologues are also prevalent in different human pathogens. Using this unique target may provide novel strategies to control these pathogenic bacteria. given the role of MerF in flagella and biofilm formation.

However. it is extreme lack of high-throughput screening (HTS) model for searching anti-Vibrio compounds. Here. we established a protein-based HTS screening model to identify agents targeting peptide deformylase (PDF) of Vibrio anguillarum. To find potential anti-Vibrio compounds. crude extracts derived from marine actinomycetes were applied for screening with this model. Notably. crude extract of strain Streptomyces sp. NHF165 inhibited dramatically both on V. anguillarum PDF (VaPDF) activity and V. anguillarum cell growth. And actinonin was further identified as the functional component. Anti-VaPDF and anti-V. anguillarum activities of actinonin were dose-dependent. and the IC50 values were 6.94 M and 2.85 M. respectively. To understand the resistance of V. anguillarum against actinonin. spontaneous V. anguillarum mutants with resistance against actinonin were isolated.

Furthermore. the interaction of full-length AnxA2 with the 3′-untranslated region of anxA2 mRNA is Ca2+-dependent. By contrast. the interaction is Ca2+-independent for the isolated domain IV of AnxA2. suggesting that the mRNA-binding site is masked in Apo-AnxA2 and gains exposure through a Ca2+-induced conformational change of AnxA2 …,True,tJ-wd84AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,37,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607003117,4079663557242903188,/scholar?cites=4079663557242903188,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46779663/The_mRNA-binding_site_of_annexin_A2_resi20160625-23223-7rgji4.pdf,0,0,0

These studies have also revealed that certain molecules do not behave according to the classical transportation rules first documented in cell biology textbooks in the 1980s and 1990s. Initially. unconventional mechanisms of secretion that do not involve passage of cargo through the stacked Golgi cisternae were thought to confer on cells the ability to discard excess amounts of protein products.

Deficiencies in the regulating actions of insulin cause diabetes mellitus. a group of diseases recognized by a variety of metabolic aberrations. Diabetes varies in severity from lethal to subclinical.At the cellular level. insulin is known to have stimulating effects on carbohydrate. lipid and protein metabolism. as well as on DNA/RNA synthesis (Brogden and Heel. 1987). The hormone stimulates the transport of monosaccharides and amino acids and modifies the degree of phosphorylation of a large number of metabolic enzymes. In addition to such well-known metabolic effects. evidence is now accumulating that insulin also has effects on components of cell structure such as the cytoskeleton.

Both forms of EF‐2 bound [3H]GDP to the same extent. [3H]GDP binding to native but not to ADP‐ribosylated EF‐2 was reduced in the presence of GTP and ribosomes. Binding of [γ‐32P]GTP to EF‐2 was significantly reduced upon ADP‐ribosylation. ADP‐ribosylation almost abolished both the stimulatory effect of ribosomes on GTP binding to EF‐2 and the ability of EF‐2 to form a high‐affinity complex with GuoPP(CH2)P and ribosomes. Low‐affinity complex formation between EF‐2 · GDP and ribosomes was not influenced by ADP‐ribosylation.

It is caused by mutations in the decorin gene (DCN) leading to the expression of a truncated form of decorin. In an attempt to replicate this condition in mice. a knock-in mouse strain. 952delT Dcn. was created.Methods.: Mice were constructed by targeted mutation. Sequencing of genomic DNA confirmed correct genotype. Mouse and human corneas. including corneas from patients with CSCD. and primary keratocyte cultures were subjected to Western blot analysis. transmission electron microscopy. and immunofluorescence microscopy.Results.: Histologically. the mice did not show any organ pathology. Corneas were clear. and the electron-lucent deposits observed in CSCD were not present. Furthermore. while nearly equivalent amounts of normal and truncated decorin are present in CSCD corneas. truncated decorin was hardly detectable in the mouse corneas. By immunofluorescence analysis of corneas from 952delT Dcn homozygous mice. decorin was found only in keratocytes. In primary cultures of mouse corneal explants. truncated decorin was retained intracellularly in contrast with human corneal explants where truncated decorin was exported into the culture medium. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that native mouse decorin localized to the Golgi complex. whereas the truncated decorin accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).Conclusions.: The ER retention of truncated decorin may explain why the mouse corneas remained clear.

1046087,The intestinal microbiota: antibiotics. colonization resistance. and enteric pathogens,2017,Sohn Kim and April Covington and Eric G Pamer,279,,1,90-105,,The human gastrointestinal tract hosts a diverse network of microorganisms. collectively known as the microbiota that plays an important role in health and disease. For instance. the intestinal microbiota can prevent invading microbes from colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. a phenomenon known as colonization resistance. Perturbations to the microbiota. such as antibiotic administration. can alter microbial composition and result in the loss of colonization resistance. Consequently. the host may be rendered susceptible to colonization by a pathogen. This is a particularly relevant concern in the hospital setting. where antibiotic use and antibiotic‐resistant pathogen exposure are more frequent. Many nosocomial infections arise from gastrointestinal colonization. Due to their resistance to antibiotics. treatment is often very challenging.

Our intent in these studies is to develop ways to enhance and restore the HIV-specific CTL response to allow long-term viral suppression or viral clearance. In our approach. we sought to genetically manipulate human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) such that they differentiate into mature CTL that will kill HIV infected cells. To perform this. we molecularly cloned an HIV-specific T cell receptor (TCR) from CD8+ T cells that specifically targets an epitope of the HIV-1 Gag protein. This TCR was then used to genetically transduce HSCs. These HSCs were then introduced into a humanized mouse containing human fetal liver. fetal thymus. and hematopoietic progenitor cells. and were allowed to differentiate into mature human CD8+ CTL. We found human. HIV-specific CTL in multiple tissues in the mouse. Thus. genetic modification of human HSCs with a cloned TCR allows proper differentiation of the cells to occur in vivo. and these cells migrate to multiple anatomic sites. mimicking what is seen in humans. To determine if the presence of the transgenic. HIV-specific TCR has an effect on suppressing HIV replication. we infected with HIV-1 mice expressing the transgenic HIV-specific TCR and. separately. mice expressing a non-specific control TCR.

Early studies have suggested that this T cell subset is refractory to infection by the virus. Subsequently it was demonstrated that quiescent cells could be infected at low levels; nevertheless these observations supported the earlier assertions of debilitating defects in the viral life cycle. This phenomenon raised hopes that identification of the block in quiescent cells could lead to the development of new therapies against HIV. As limiting levels of raw cellular factors such as nucleotides did not account for the block to infection. a number of groups pursued the identification of cellular proteins whose presence or absence may impact the permissiveness of quiescent T cells to HIV infection.

Although most strains of L. monocytogenes are antibiotic sensitive. antibiotic treatment is frustratingly ineffective at curing highly immunocompromised patients. resulting in a mortality rate of approximately 30%. The gut microbiota. which consists of commensal bacterial populations that inhabit the intestine. normally confers protection against orally acquired pathogens by exerting colonization resistance. Changes in microbiota composition induced by disease. pharmacological or antibiotic therapies can lead to dysbiosis. thereby impairing commensal-mediated colonization resistance and predisposing to infection. Our preliminary data show that bacterial species represented in a healthy microbiota can efficiently eliminate Listeria monocytogenes …,True,lcl2SxcAAAAJ:gyhANspY9yIC,0,https://cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org/content/4/11_Supplement/A082.abstract,,,,,0,0,0

Generation of all hematopoietic lineages suffers in the face of infection. The mechanisms by which HIV impairs normal blood cell development remain unclear and direct infection of intermediate hematopoietic progenitors has not been established as a source of HIV associated hematopoietic pathology. Here. we demonstrate infection of multiple subsets of highly purified intermediate hematopoietic progenitors by wild type HIV both in vitro and in vivo. While direct infection is clearly cytotoxic. we find that some infected progenitors can survive and harbor proviral DNA. We report intermediate hematopoietic progenitors to be a novel target of infection and their permissivity to infection increases with development. Further. the NSG-BLT humanized mouse provides a unique model for studying the impact of HIV infection on bone marrow-based human hematopoiesis.,True,lcl2SxcAAAAJ:qwlfnX_dBN8C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17478974216222808461&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
1046115,In Vivo Suppression of HIV by Antigen Specific T Cells Derived from Engineered,2012,SG Kitchen and BR Levin and G Bristol and V Rezek and S Kim,,,,,,The HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is a critical component in controlling viral replication in vivo. but ultimately fails in its ability to eradicate the virus. Our intent in these studies is to develop ways to enhance and restore the HIV-specific CTL response to allow long-term viral suppression or viral clearance. In our approach. we sought to genetically manipulate human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) such that they differentiate into mature CTL that will kill HIV infected cells. To perform this. we molecularly cloned an HIV-specific T cell receptor (TCR) from CD8+ T cells that specifically targets an epitope of the HIV-1 Gag protein. This TCR was then used to genetically transduce HSCs. These HSCs were then introduced into a humanized mouse containing human fetal liver. fetal thymus. and hematopoietic progenitor cells. and were allowed to differentiate into mature human CD8+ CTL. We found human. HIV-specific CTL in multiple tissues in the mouse. Thus. genetic modification of human HSCs with a cloned TCR allows proper differentiation of the cells to occur in vivo. and these cells migrate to multiple anatomic sites. mimicking what is seen in humans. To determine if the presence of the transgenic. HIV-specific TCR has an effect on suppressing HIV replication. we infected with HIV-1 mice expressing the transgenic HIV-specific TCR and. separately. mice expressing a non-specific control TCR. We observed significant suppression of HIV replication in multiple organs in the mice expressing the HIV-specific TCR as compared to control. indicating that the presence of genetically modified HIV-specific CTL can form a functional …,True,lcl2SxcAAAAJ:uwjMLcW8QH4C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/53527226/In_Vivo_Suppression_of_HIV_by_Antigen_Sp20170615-17811-psgzal.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53527226/In_Vivo_Suppression_of_HIV_by_Antigen_Sp20170615-17811-psgzal.pdf,0,0,0

Amongst oleaginous eukaryotic algae. the B race of Botryococcus braunii is unique in that it produces large amounts of liquid hydrocarbons of terpenoid origin. These are comparable to fossil crude oil. and are sequestered outside the cells in a communal extracellular polymeric matrix material. Biosynthetic engineering of terpenoid bio-crude production requires identification of genes and reconstruction of metabolic pathways responsible for production of both hydrocarbons and other metabolites of the alga that compete for photosynthetic carbon and energy. A de novo assembly of 1.334.609 next-generation pyrosequencing reads form the Showa strain of the B race of B. braunii yielded a transcriptomic database of 46.422 contigs with an average length of 756 bp.

BS. Rochester University Chair of Advisory Committee: Dr. Timothy P. DevarenneBotryococcus braunii (Chlorophyta. Botryococcaceae) is a colony-forming green microalga that produces large amounts of liquid hydrocarbons. which can be converted into transportation fuels. While B. braunii has been well studied for the chemistry of the hydrocarbon production. very little is known about the molecular biology of B. braunii. As such. this study developed both apparatus and techniques to culture B. braunii for use in the genetic and biochemical characterization. During genetic studies. the genome size was determined of a representative strain of each of the three races of B. braunii. A. B. and L. that are distinguished based on the type of hydrocarbon each produces. Flow cytometry analysis indicates that the A race. Yamanaka strain. of B. braunii has a genome size of 166.0±0.4 Mb. which is similar to the B race. Berkeley strain. with a genome size of 166±2.2 Mb. while the L race.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent intercellular lipid mediator and second messenger that exerts its activity through a PAF-specific receptor (PAFR). Previous data from our group suggested that T. cruzi synthesizes a phospholipid with PAF-like activity. The structure of T. cruzi PAF-like molecule. however. remains elusive.  Methodology/Principal findings Here. we have purified and structurally characterized the putative T. cruzi PAF-like molecule by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Our ESI-MS/MS data demonstrated that the T. cruzi PAF-like molecule is actually a lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). namely sn-1 C18:1(delta 9)-LPC. Similar to PAF. the platelet-aggregating activity of C18:1-LPC was abrogated by the PAFR antagonist. WEB 2086. Other major LPC species. i.e.. C16:0-. C18:0-. and C18:2-LPC. were also characterized in all T. cruzi stages. These LPC species. however. failed to induce platelet aggregation. Quantification of T. cruzi LPC species by ESI-MS revealed that intracellular amastigote and trypomastigote forms have much higher levels of C18:1-LPC than epimastigote and metacyclic trypomastigote forms. C18:1-LPC was also found to be secreted by the parasite in extracellular vesicles (EV) and an EV-free fraction.

In the present study. we demonstrate for the first time the uptake of lipophorin (Lp). the main lipid-transporting particle of insect hemolymph. We observed that living T. rangeli parasites uptake lipids from both 32P- and 3H-. or 125I-labeled Lp. However. the parasites do not uptake any other hemolymphatic protein such as 32P-labeled vitellogenin. The presence of a specific receptor to Lp in the parasite surface is suggested based on experiments using 125I-Lp.

These parasites are transmitted to plants via the bite of an infected phytophagous hemipteran. Despite the economic impact of these parasites. many basic questions regarding the genus Phytomonas remain unanswered. such as the mechanism by which the parasites cope with the immune response of the insect vector. In this report. using a model of systemic infection. we describe the function of Oncopeltus fasciatus hemocytes in the immune response towards the tomato parasite Phytomonas serpens. Hemocytes respond to infection by trapping parasites in nodular structures and phagocytizing the parasites. In electron microscopy of hemocytes. parasites were located inside vacuoles. which appear fused with lysosomes. The parasites reached the O. fasciatus salivary glands at least six hours post-infection. After 72 hours post-infection. many parasites were attached to the salivary gland outer surface.

These ectoenzymes are important ecto-nucleotidases that are characterized by the ability to hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside diphosphates to the monophosphate form. The hydrolysis of nucleoside monophosphates to nucleosides such as adenosine may then be catalyzed by the action of ecto-5 nucleotidases. The present study reviews the sequential hydrolysis of ATP→ ADP→ AMP→ adenosine catalyzed by these ecto-enzymes from different trypanosomatids.

Here. we present a cryo-EM reconstruction of the native human γ-TuRC at ∼3.8 Å resolution. revealing an asymmetric. cone-shaped structure. Pseudo-atomic models indicate that GCP4. GCP5. and GCP6 form distinct Y-shaped assemblies that structurally mimic GCP2/GCP3 subcomplexes distal to the γ-TuRC “seam.” We also identify an unanticipated structural bridge that includes an actin-like protein and spans the γ-TuRC lumen. Despite its asymmetric architecture. the γ-TuRC arranges γ-tubulins into a helical geometry poised to nucleate microtubules. Diversity in the γ-TuRC subunits introduces large (>100.000 Å2) surfaces in the complex that allow for interactions with different regulatory factors.

These pre-60S particles mature by transiently interacting with various assembly factors. The ~5000 amino-acid AAA+ ATPase Rea1 (or Midasin) generates force to mechanically remove assembly factors from pre-60S particles. which promotes their export to the cytosol. Here we present three Rea1 cryoEM structures. We visualise the Rea1 engine. a hexameric ring of AAA+ domains. and identify an α-helical bundle of AAA2 as a major ATPase activity regulator. The α-helical bundle interferes with nucleotide-induced conformational changes that create a docking site for the substrate binding MIDAS domain on the AAA +ring. Furthermore. we reveal the architecture of the Rea1 linker. which is involved in force generation and extends from the AAA+ ring.

Since aquaporin-4 (AQP4) has been implicated in brain edema in other conditions. we examined its role in a rat model of ALF induced by the hepatotoxin thioacetamide. Rats with ALF showed increased AQP4 protein in the plasma membrane (PM). Total tissue levels of AQP4 protein and mRNA levels were not altered. indicating that increased AQP4 is not transcriptionally mediated but likely reflects a more stable anchoring of AQP4 to the PM and/or interference with its degradation. An increase inAQP4 immunoreactivity in thePM was observed in perivascular astrocytes in ALF.

Inc.,Among the consequences of Alzheimer disease are disturbances in synaptic integrity that ultimately lead to impaired cognitive functions. Thrombospondins are extracellular matrix proteins that. in the CNS. are predominantly produced by astrocytes and have been implicated in synaptogenesis. This study examined the effects of amyloid-β (Aβ1–42; Aβ) peptide on intracellular and extracellular levels of thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) in cultured astrocytes. Amyloid-β caused a significant (1- to 3-fold) increase in astrocytic intracellular levels of TSP-1 (increased retention) that was associated with a reduction of its release from astrocytes. Because Aβ is known to induce oxidative stress in astrocytes. we examined the effects of the antioxidants tempol and apocynin on astrocytic TSP-1 levels and release.

Herein we report that TAp63γ and ΔNp63β appear to be an integral part of the osteoblastic differentiation of hMSC and are differentially regulated by the vitamin D3 metabolites 1α.25(OH)2D3 and 24R.25(OH)2D3. We compared the endogenous expression of p63 isoforms (TA- and ΔNp63) and splice variants (p63α. -β. -γ). in naive hMSC and during osteoblastic differentiation of hMSC. TAp63α and -β were the predominant p63 variants in naive. proliferating hMSC. In contrast. under osteoblastic differentiation conditions. expression of p63 changed from the TAp63α and -β to the TAp63γ and ΔNp63β variants. Transient overexpression of the p63 variants demonstrated that TAp63β. ΔNp63β. and ΔNp63γ increased alkaline phosphatase activity and ΔNp63α and -γ increased the expression of mRNA for osteocalcin and osterix. Our results support the hypothesis that TAp63α and -β promote a naive state in hMSC. Moreover. TAp63γ is increased during and promotes early osteoblastic differentiation through the expression of pro-osteogenic genes; VDR. Osterix. Runx2 and Osteopontin. ΔNp63β also appears to support osteogenic maturation through increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Treatment with 1α.25(OH)2D3 increased the expression of mRNA for ΔNp63. while addition of 24R.25(OH)2D3 increased the expression of TA- and ΔNp63γ variants.

Human adult stem cells are perhaps the most clinically relevant. Due to their broader clinical use. extensive research. and a rather more comprehensive understanding of their physiology. bone marrow-derived cells appear as the first choice for applications in regenerative medicine. Models for addressing fundamental aspects of stem cell biology and behavior have been developed in numerous species including C. elegans. drosophila. rodents. and humans. Extensive research around the world has dramatically increased our understanding of the fundamental aspects of stem cell biology and their applications for the treatment of human and animal diseases. Numerous environmental and trophic factors have been identified to play central roles in regulating the self-renewal. proliferation. migration. differentiation. senescence. and death of stem cells. their derived progeny. and the final differentiated cells that perform all tissue and organ functions. Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells. derived primarily from the bone marrow. have been examined extensively for their capacity to repair damaged tissues. Besides direct differentiation ofthe stem cells to the desired mature cell type. other indirect mechanisms have been identified to play important roles in the overall repair of the injured tissue.

1046459,Cell death and cavitation: the beginning of organogenesis,2013,L Xiao and T Tsutsui,4,J Tissue Sci Eng,,e122,,During embryonic development. cell death and the control of cell survival play major roles for the formation of various organs. In the solid embryonic structures. such as morula and primordiums. starvation and hypoxia cause central cell death [1]. Dying cells express the “eat-me” signal and are cleaned up by the neighbor cells through autophagy [2. 3]. As a result. a lumen or cavity was created that also named cavitation or lumenation. The lumens or caves not only bring nutrition and oxygen for the surviving cells. but also deliver signals for differentiation. Under appropriate conditions created by the cavitation. the surviving cells differentiated into functional mature cells and then form tissues and organs [4-7](Figure 1).For tissue engineering of hollow organs. such as lungs. kidneys and intestines. it is important to represent the above-mentioned process. Embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been wildly used to study cavitation and embryonic development due to their ability to forming embryoid bodies (EBs). Early in 1977. Martin et al.[4] described how to producing and culturing EBs to study embyogenesis. In 1999. Coucouvanis and Martin [8] reported that EBs in vitro could represent the process of cavitation. and signaling for death and survival is the underline mechanism. In 2007. Qu et al.[2] demonstrated that autophagy plays an important role in embryonic cavitation. Embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from cells lacking the autophagy genes fail to cavitation. A recent study showed that after straightly controlled the process of differentiation. human iPS cell-derived EBs were differentiated into intestinal tissue in vitro [9 …,True,4KhwmKgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2725343325846976112&hl=en&oi=scholarr,2725343325846976112,/scholar?cites=2725343325846976112,,,0,0,0

Hypochlorite (HOCl) is produced by neutrophils to kill invading microorganisms. The bactericidal activity of HOCl is due to proteome-wide unfolding and oxidation of proteins at cysteine and methionine residues. Escherichia coli cells are protected from HOCl-killing by the previously identified dodecameric transcription factor HypT (YjiE). Here. we aimed to unravel whether HOCl activates HypT directly or via a reaction product of HOCl with a cellular component. Bacterial viability assays and analysis of target gene regulation indicate that HypT is highly specific to activation by HOCl and that no reaction products of HOCl such as monochloramine. hydroxyl radicals. or methionine sulfoxide activate HypT in vivo. Surprisingly. purified HypT lost its DNA-binding activity upon incubation with HOCl or reaction products that oxidize HypT to form a disulfide-linked dimer. and regained DNA-binding activity upon reduction. Thus. we postulate that the cysteines in HypT contribute to control the DNA-binding activity of HypT in vitro. HypT contains five cysteine residues; a HypT mutant with all cysteines substituted by serine is aggregation-prone and forms tetramers in addition to the typical dodecamers. Using single and multiple cysteine-to-serine mutants. we identified Cys150 to be required for stability and Cys4 being important for oligomerization of HypT to dodecamers. Further. oxidation of Cys4 is responsible for the loss of DNA-binding of HypT upon oxidation in vitro.

Point mutations within the domain are important to shift the VL into the fibrillar pathway. but why and how only some site-specific mutations achieve this still remains elusive. We show here that both destabilizing and surprisingly stable mutants readily predispose an amyloid-resistant VL domain to amyloid formation. The decreased thermodynamic stability of the destabilizing mutant results in the accumulation of non-native intermediates that readily populate the amyloid state.

The α-crystallins are thought to counteract this process as chaperones by sequestering misfolded crystallin proteins. In this scenario. chaperone pool depletion would result in lens opacification. Here we analyze lenses from different mouse strains that develop early-onset cataract due to point mutations in α-. β-. or γ-crystallin proteins.

This method has proven valuable because it provides structural information with single base pair resolution. Recent developments in the field introduced the ‘synchrotron X-ray footprinting’ method. which uses a high-flux X-ray source to produce single base pair fragmentation of nucleic acid in tens of milliseconds. We developed a complementary method that utilizes X-rays generated from a conventional rotating anode machine in which nucleic acid footprints can be generated by X-ray exposures as short as 100–300 ms. Our theoretical and experimental studies indicate that efficient cleavage of nucleic acids by X‐rays depends upon sample preparation. energy of the X-ray source and the beam intensity.

The evolutionarily conserved lysine-265 (K265) of the myosin-2 motor from Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd) is proposed to be a key residue in an allosteric communication pathway that mediates actin-nucleotide coupling. To better understand the role of K265. point mutations were introduced within the Dd myosin-2 M765-2R framework. replacing this lysine with alanine (K265A). glutamic acid (K265E) or glutamine (K265Q). and the functional and kinetic properties of the resulting myosin motors were assessed. The alanine and glutamic acid substitutions reduced actin-activated ATPase activity. slowed the in vitro sliding velocity and attenuated the inhibitory potential of the allosteric myosin inhibitor pentabromopseudilin (PBP).

Metal cations bind to CDF protein's cytoplasmic C‐terminal domain (CTD). leading to closure from its apo open V‐shaped dimer to a tighter packed structure. followed by a conformational change of the transmembrane domain. thus enabling transport of the metal cation. By implementing a comprehensive range of biochemical and biophysical methods. we studied the molecular mechanism of metal binding to the magnetotactic bacterial CDF protein MamM CTD.

Here. we present a novel optical tweezers assay that allows monitoring the activity of RecBCD’s individual subunits. when they are part of an intact full complex. We show that RecBCD and its subunits are able to generate forces up to 25–40 pN without a significant effect on their velocity. Moreover. the isolated RecD translocates fast but is a weak helicase with limited processivity.

Lucanthone is in Phase I clinical trial. whereas hycanthone was pulled out of Phase II trials. Their potential mechanism of action includes DNA intercalation. inhibition of nucleic acid biosyntheses. and inhibition of enzymes like topoisomerases and the dual function base excision repair enzyme apurinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). Lucanthone inhibits the endonuclease activity of APE1. without affecting its redox activity. Our goal was to decipher the precise mechanism of APE1 inhibition as a prerequisite towards development of improved therapeutics that can counteract higher APE1 activity often seen in tumors. The IC50 values for inhibition of APE1 incision of depurinated plasmid DNA by lucanthone and hycanthone were 5 µM and 80 nM. respectively. The KD values (affinity constants) for APE1. as determined by BIACORE binding studies. were 89 nM for lucanthone/10 nM for hycanthone.

Knowledge on tsetse distribution and accurate species identification help identify potential vector intervention sites. Morphological species identification of tsetse is challenging and sometimes not accurate. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) technique. already standardised for microbial identification. could become a standard method for tsetse fly diagnostics. Therefore. a unique spectra reference database was created for five lab-reared species of riverine-. savannah- and forest- type tsetse flies and incorporated with the commercial Biotyper 3.0 database. The standard formic acid/acetonitrile extraction of male and female whole insects and their body parts (head. thorax. abdomen. wings and legs) was used to obtain the flies' proteins. The computed composite correlation index and cluster analysis revealed the suitability of any tsetse body part for a rapid taxonomical identification. Phyloproteomic analysis revealed that the peak patterns of G. brevipalpis differed greatly from the other tsetse. This outcome was comparable to previous theories that they might be considered as a sister group to other tsetse spp. Freshly extracted samples were found to be matched at the species level.

Bad hygiene and stress is often related to pulmonary diseases in camels. This study investigated whether camels slaughtered in Cairo carried pulmonary infections.Methodology: Five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and 100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial identification and histopathology.Results: A total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species. including Staphylococcus aureus (37.14%). Escherichia coli (27.14%). Klebsiella pneumoniae (26.71%). Bacillus spp.(25.72%). Streptococcus pyogenes (10%). Corynebacterium spp.(8.85%). Pasteurella spp.(2.85%). and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (1.4%). Some of these species were earlier reported to be associated with pulmonary infection. Histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in 50% of the investigated lungs.Conclusions: A considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic agents in their lower respiratory tracts. Immunosuppression and stressful conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in camels. Thus. the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections agents.

The impact of co-infections and development of anthelmintic resistance requires improved diagnostic tools. especially for parasitic nematodes e.g. to identify resistant species or attribute pathological effects to individual species or particular species combinations. In horses. co-infection with cyathostomins is rather a rule than an exception with typically 5 to 15 species (out of more than 40 described) per individual host. In cyathostomins. reliable morphological species differentiation is currently limited to adults and requires highly specialized expertize while precise morphological identification of eggs and early stage larvae is impossible. The situation is further complicated by a questionable validity of some cyathostomins while others might actually represent cryptic species complexes. Several molecular methods using different target sequences were established to overcome these limitations. For adult worms. PCR followed by sequencing of mitochondrial genes or external or internal ribosomal RNA spacers is suitable to genetically confirm morphological identifications. The most commonly used method to differentiate eggs or larvae is the reverse-line-blot hybridization assay. However. both methods suffer from the fact that target sequences are not available for many species or even that GenBank® entries are unreliable regarding the cyathostomin species. Recent advances in proteomic tools for identification of metazoans including insects and nematodes of the genus Trichinella will be evaluated for suitability to diagnose cyathostomins.

Current diagnosis of S. aureus mastitis is based on bacteriological culture of milk samples and somatic cell counts. which lack either sensitivity or specificity. Identification of milk proteins that contribute to host defense and their variable responses to pathogenic stimuli would enable the characterization of putative biomarkers of subclinical mastitis. To accomplish this. milk whey samples from healthy and mastitic dairy cows were analyzed using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach. In total. 90 proteins were identified. of which 25 showed significant differential abundance between healthy and mastitic samples. In silico functional analyses indicated the involvement of the differentially abundant proteins in biological mechanisms and signaling pathways related to host defense including pathogen-recognition. direct antimicrobial function. and the acute-phase response. This proteomics and bioinformatics analysis not only facilitates the identification of putative biomarkers of S. aureus subclinical mastitis but also recapitulates previous findings demonstrating the abundance of host defense proteins in intramammary infection.

Currently. nine species and three genotypes are recognized. of which T. spiralis. T. britovi and T. pseudospiralis have the highest public health relevance. To date. the differentiation of the larvae to the species and genotype level is based primarily on molecular methods. which can be relatively time consuming and labor intensive. Due to its rapidness and ease of use a matrix assisted laser desorption / ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) reference spectra database using Trichinella strains of all known species and genotypes was created. A formicacid/acetonitrile protein extraction was carried out after pooling 10 larvae of each Trichinella species and genotype. Each sample was spotted 9 times using α-cyano 4-hydoxy cinnamic acid matrix and a MicroFlex LT mass spectrometer was used to acquire 3 spectra (m/z 2000 to 20000 Da) from each spot resulting in 27 spectra/species or genotype. Following the spectra quality assessment. Biotyper software was used to create a main spectra library (MSP) representing nine species and three genotypes of Trichinella. The evaluation of the spectra generated by MALDI-TOF MS revealed a classification which was comparable to the results obtained by molecular methods. Also. each Trichinella species utilized in this study was distinct and distinguishable with a high confidence level.

Of the seven currently recognized M. kansasii genotypes (I-VII). genotypes I and II are most prevalent and have been associated with human disease. whereas the other five (III-VII) genotypes are predominantly of environmental origin and are believed to be non-pathogenic. Subtyping of M. kansasii serves as a valuable tool to guide clinicians in pursuing diagnosis and to initiate the proper timely treatment. Most of the previous rapid diagnostic tests for mycobacteria employing the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology focused on species-level identification. The purpose of this study was to establish MALDI-TOF MS reference spectra database for discrimination of M. kansasii at the genotype level. A panel of 32 strains. representatives of M. kansasii genotypes I-VI were selected. whole cell proteins extracted and measured with MALDI-TOF MS. A unique main spectra (MSP) library was created using MALDI Biotyper Compass Explorer software. The spectra reproducibility was assessed by computing composite correlation index and MSPs cross-matching. One hundred clinical M. kansasii isolates used for testing of the database resulted in 90 % identification at genus-level. 7 % identification at species-level and 2% identification was below the threshold of log score value 1.7. of which all were correct at genotype level.

In recent decades. the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC-producing bacteria has increased rapidly across the world. Here. we evaluate the potential use of bacteriophages in terms of a reduction of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in healthy animals. The aim of our studies was to isolate bacteriophages capable of destroying ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli isolated from livestock habitats. The efficacy of isolated phages against ESBL/AmpC E. coli strains varies. but creation of a phage cocktail with broad activity spectrum is possible. This may indicate that the role of phages may not be limited to phage therapy. but bacterial viruses may also be applied against spread of bacteria with antibiotic resistance genes in the environment. We also addressed the hypothesis. that phages. effective for therapeutic purposes may be isolated from distant places and even from different environments other than the actual location of the targeted bacteria.

Prototheca spp.,2017,Jayaseelan Murugaiyan and Murat Eravci and Christoph Weise and Uwe Roesler,18,International journal of molecular sciences,1,59,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Microalgae of the genus Prototheca (P.) spp are associated with rare algal infections of invertebrates termed protothecosis. Among the seven generally accepted species. P. zopfii genotype 2 (GT2) is associated with a severe form of bovine mastitis while P. blaschkeae causes the mild and sub-clinical form of mastitis. The reason behind the infectious nature of P. zopfii GT2. while genotype 1 (GT1) remains non-infectious. is not known. Therefore. in the present study we investigated the protein expression level difference between the genotypes of P. zopfii and P. blaschkeae. Cells were cultured to the mid-exponential phase. harvested. and processed for LC-MS analysis. Peptide data was acquired on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos. raw spectra were quantitatively analyzed with MaxQuant software and matching with the reference database of Chlorella variabilis and Auxenochlorella protothecoides resulted in the identification of 226 proteins. Comparison of an environmental strain with infectious strains resulted in the identification of 51 differentially expressed proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism. energy production and protein translation. The expression level of Hsp70 proteins and their role in the infectious process is worth further investigation. All mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005305.

Several studies have shown that they mediate cell-to-cell communication in a variety of biological processes. Thus. in addition to cell-to-cell direct interaction or secretion of active molecules. they are now considered another class of signal mediators. Exosomes can be secreted by several cell types and retrieved in many body fluids. such as blood. urine. saliva and cerebrospinal fluid. In addition to proteins and lipids. they also contain nucleic acids. namely mRNA and miRNA. These features have prompted extensive research to exploit them as a source of biomarkers for several pathologies. such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In this context. exosomes also appear attractive as gene delivery vehicles. Furthermore. exosome immunomodulatory and regenerative properties are also encouraging their application for further therapeutic purposes. Nevertheless. several issues remain to be addressed: exosome biogenesis and secretion mechanisms have not been clearly understood. and physiological functions. as well as pathological roles. are far from being satisfactorily elucidated.

The conserved Regions I and II have been well studied but little is known about the immunogenic central repeat region and the N-terminal region of the protein. Rodent malaria Plasmodium berghei parasites. in which the endogenous CS gene has been replaced with the avian Plasmodium gallinaceum CS (PgCS) sequence. develop normally in the A. stephensi mosquito midgut but the sporozoites are not infectious. We therefore generated P. berghei transgenic parasites carrying the PgCS gene. in which the repeat region was replaced with the homologous region of P. berghei CS (PbCS). A further line. in which both the N-terminal region and repeat region were replaced with the homologous regions of PbCS. was also generated. Introduction of the PbCS repeat region alone. into the PgCS gene. did not rescue sporozoite species-specific infectivity. However. the introduction of both the PbCS repeat region and the N-terminal region into the PgCS gene completely rescued infectivity. in both the mosquito vector and the mammalian host. Immunofluorescence experiments and western blot analysis revealed correct localization and proteolytic processing of CSP in the chimeric parasites. The results demonstrate. in vivo. that the repeat region of P. berghei CSP. alone. is unable to mediate sporozoite infectivity in either the mosquito or the mammalian host. but suggest an important role for the N-terminal region in sporozoite host cell invasion.,True,FuzYIWUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,38,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032524,11729475390144835001,/scholar?cites=11729475390144835001,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032524,0,0,0

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that KRIT1 plays an important role in major redox-sensitive mechanisms. including transcriptional pathways and autophagy. which play major roles in cellular homeostasis and defense against oxidative stress. raising the possibility that KRIT1 loss has pleiotropic effects on multiple redox-sensitive systems. Using previously established cellular models. we found that KRIT1 loss-of-function affects the glutathione (GSH) redox system. causing a significant decrease in total GSH levels and increase in oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG). with a consequent deficit in the GSH/GSSG redox ratio and GSH-mediated antioxidant capacity. Redox proteomic analyses showed that these effects are associated with increased S-glutathionylation of distinct proteins involved in adaptive responses to oxidative stress. including redox-sensitive chaperonins. metabolic enzymes. and cytoskeletal proteins. suggesting a novel molecular signature of KRIT1 loss-of-function. Besides providing further insights into the emerging pleiotropic functions of KRIT1. these findings point definitively to KRIT1 as a major player in redox biology. shedding new light on the mechanistic relationship between KRIT1 loss-of-function and enhanced cell sensitivity to oxidative stress. which may eventually lead to cellular dysfunctions and CCM disease pathogenesis.

However. as Rp is a strong immunosuppressant. specific delivery to the brain has been postulated to avoid systemic exposure. In this work. we fabricated new Rp loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (Rp-SLN) stabilized with polysorbate 80 (PS80). comparing two different methods and lipids. The formulations were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). dynamic light scattering (DLS) and particle tracking. In vitro release and short-term stability were assessed. Biological behavior of Rp-SLN was tested in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The inhibition of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) was evaluated over time by a pulse-chase study compared to free Rp and Rp nanocrystals. Compritol Rp-SLN resulted more stable and possessing proper size and surface properties with respect to cetyl palmitate Rp-SLN. Rapamycin was entrapped in an amorphous form in the solid lipid matrix that showed partial crystallinity with stable Lβ. sub-Lα and Lβ′ arrangements. PS80 was stably anchored on particle surface.

In fact. the expression of the constitutively activated H-RasV12 induces cell growth arrest and premature senescence. which act like barriers in pre-neoplastic lesions. In our experimental model. human fibroblasts transfected with H-RasV12 show a dramatic modification of morphology. H-RasV12 expressing cells also show premature senescence followed by cell death. induced by autophagy and apoptosis. In this context. we provide evidence that in H-RasV12 expressing cells. the premature senescence is associated with cellular redox imbalance as well as with altered post-translation protein modification. In particular. redox imbalance is due to a strong reduction of total antioxidant capacity. and significant decrease of glutathione level. As the reversible addition of glutathione to cysteinyl residues of proteins is an important post-translational regulative modification. we investigated S-glutathionylation in cells expressing active H-Ras. In this contest we observed different S-glutathionylation patterns in control and H-RasV12 expressing cells. Particularly. the GAPDH enzyme showed S-glutathionylation increase and significant enzyme activity depletion in H-Ras V12 cells. In conclusion. we proposed that antioxidant defense reduction. glutathione depletion and subsequent modification of S-glutathionylation of target proteins contribute to arrest cell growth. leading to death of fibroblasts expressing constitutively active H-Ras oncogene. thus acting as oncogenic barriers that obstacle the …,True,FuzYIWUAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,22,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052151,18247584899971167595,/scholar?cites=18247584899971167595,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052151,0,0,0

Bradyzoites adopt reduced metabolism and slow replication while waiting for an opportunity to recrudesce the infection within the host. Interconversion between these two developmental stages is characterized by expression of glycolytic isoenzymes that play key roles in parasite metabolism. The parasite genome encodes two isoforms of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH1 and LDH2) and enolase (ENO1 and ENO2) that are expressed in a stage‐specific manner. Expression of different isoforms of these enzymes allows T. gondii to rapidly adapt to diverse metabolic requirements necessary for either a rapid replication of the tachyzoite stage or a quiescent lifestyle typical of the bradyzoites.

They mediate a variety of physiological processes. such as cellular clearance. lipid homeostasis. energy metabolism and pathogen defence. Lysosomes can secrete their content through a process called lysosome exocytosis in which lysosomes fuse with the plasma membrane realising their content into the extracellular milieu. Lysosomal exocytosis is not only responsible for the secretion of lysosomal enzymes. but it also has a crucial role in the plasma membrane repair. Recently. it has been demonstrated that lysosome response to the physiologic signals is regulated by the transcription factor EB (TFEB).

Ubiquitin is ligated to substrate proteins as monomers or chains. and the topology of ubiquitin modifications regulates substrate interactions with specific proteins. Thus ubiquitination directs a variety of substrate fates. including proteasomal degradation. Deubiquitinase enzymes cleave ubiquitin from substrates and are implicated in disease; for example ubiquitin-specific protease-7 (USP7) regulates stability of the p53 tumor suppressor and other proteins critical for tumor cell survival. However. developing selective deubiquitinase inhibitors has been challenging and no co-crystal structures have been solved with small-molecule inhibitors. Here. using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based screening and structure-based design. we describe the development of selective USP7 inhibitors GNE-6640 and GNE-6776.

In permeabilized hepatocytes glycogen metabolism. bypassed by the addition of UDP-glucose. stimulated glucuronidation which was insensitive to glutathione depletion. In liver microsomes either UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity or UDP-glucuronic acid transport was not influenced by GSH/GSSG ratio.

The transport is required for the functioning of the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme that is situated in the lumen of the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum. The genetic deficiency of the glucose 6-phosphate transport activity causes a severe metabolic disease termed type 1b glycogen storage disease. The cDNA encoding a liver transporter for glucose 6-phosphate was cloned and was found to be mutated in patients suffering from glycogen storage disease 1b.

In addition. fibrinogen degradation products also enhance fibrinogen synthesis in the liver. which seems to play a regulatory role [3]. Multiple cleavage of fibrinogen by plasmin results in the formation of two types of fragment: fibrinogen degradation product D (FDP-D) and fibrinogen degradation product E (FDP-E)[4]. Similar to LPS. FDP-D is a potent stimulator of IL-6 production in perfused mouse liver and isolated human monocytes [5]. However. the extent and time course of its effect differ from those induced by LPS. suggesting a difference in the mechanism of action. It seems likely that FDP-D participates in the regulation of fibrinogen synthesis via IL-6 production. Besides the stimulation of IL-6 production. LPS and FDP-D also cause metabolic changes in the liver. These changes are macrophage (Kupffer cell) dependent indicating a requirement for intercellular communication. Moreover. their effects are slightly different: in contrast to LPS. FDP-D fails to increase glucose production in perfused liver. It has been suggested that this metabolic effect of LPS is mediated by eicosanoids (PGD2 and PGE2) produced by Kupffer cells [6]. Besides interleukin-1 (IL-1). a major cytokine mediator of LPS action [1]. prostaglandins are also involved in the effect of LPS on IL-6 production [7. 8]. Therefore. it seemed reasonable to examine whether the effect of FDP-D on IL-6 formation was influenced by prostaglandins.

Palmitoyl- and oleoyl-CoA did not affect p-nitrophenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity in native microsomes but were inhibitory in permeabilised vesicles. The extent of inhibition was dependent on the effectiveness of permeabilisation and was constant in time in fully permeabilised microsomes. Fatty acyl-CoAs mobilised calcium from calcium-loaded microsomes. Elevation of the intracellular acyl-CoA level by the addition of palmitate or oleate inhibited the glucuronidation of p-nitrophenol in isolated hepatocytes.

Mitochondria generate the energetic potential via the respiratory complexes I to IV. which constitute the electron transport chain (ETC). together with complex V. These redox reactions release energy in the form of ATP and also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are involved in cell signaling but can eventually lead to oxidative stress. Complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the largest ETC enzyme. containing 44 subunits and the main contributor to ROS production. In recent years. the structure of the CI has become available and has provided new insights into CI assembly. A number of chaperones have been identified in the assembly and stability of the mature holo-CI. although they are not part of its final structure. Interestingly. CI dysfunction is the most common OXPHOS disorder in humans and defects in the CI assembly process are often observed. However. the dynamic of the events leading to CI biogenesis remains elusive. which precludes our understanding of how ETC malfunctioning affects neuronal integrity.

PrP C. into its misfolded and pathogenic isoform. known as prion or PrP Sc. plays a key role in prion diseases. These maladies are denoted transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and affect both humans and animals. A prerequisite for understanding TSEs is unraveling the molecular mechanism leading to the conversion process whereby most α-helical motifs are replaced by β-sheet secondary structures. Importantly. most point mutations linked to inherited prion diseases are clustered in the C-terminal domain region of PrP C and cause spontaneous conversion to PrP Sc. Structural studies with PrP variants promise new clues regarding the proposed conversion mechanism and may help identify “hot spots” in PrP C involved in the pathogenic conversion. These investigations may also shed light on the early structural rearrangements occurring in some PrP C epitopes thought to be involved in modulating prion susceptibility.

Despite the importance for pathogenesis. the mechanism of prion formation has escaped detailed characterization due to the insoluble nature of prions. PrP C interacts with copper through octarepeat and non-octarepeat binding sites. Copper coordination to the non-octarepeat region has garnered interest due to the possibility that this interaction may impact prion conversion.

Animal TSE include scrapie in sheep and goats. and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids. Effective management of scrapie in many parts of the world. and of CWD in North American deer population is complicated by the persistence of prions in the environment. After shedding from diseased animals. prions persist in soil. withstanding biotic and abiotic degradation. As soil is a complex. multi-component system of both mineral and organic components. it is important to understand which soil compounds may interact with prions and thus contribute to disease transmission.

We evaluated the kinetics of recPrP adsorption. providing a structural and biochemical characterization of chemical adducts using different experimental approaches. Here we show that HS act as potent anti-prion agents in prion infected neuronal cells and in the amyloid seeding assays: HS adsorb both recPrP and prions. thus sequestering them from the prion replication process.

Changes in prion structure upon environmental exposure may be significant as they can affect prion infectivity and disease pathology. Despite its relevance. the mechanisms of prion interaction with HS are still not completely understood. The goal of this work is to advance a structural-level picture of the encapsulation of recombinant. non-infectious. prion protein (PrP) into different natural HS. We observed that PrP precipitation upon addition of HS is mainly driven by a mechanism of “salting-out” whereby PrP molecules are rapidly removed from the solution and aggregate in insoluble adducts with humic molecules. Importantly. this process does not alter the protein folding since insoluble PrP retains its α-helical content when in complex with HS. The observed ability of HS to promote PrP insolubilization without altering its secondary structure may have potential relevance in the context of “prion ecology”. These results suggest that soil organic matter interacts with prions possibly without altering the protein structures. This may facilitate prions preservation from biotic and abiotic degradation leading to their accumulation in the environment.,True,agT6Qs8AAAAJ:txeM2kYbVNMC,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188308,3260524705395343267,/scholar?cites=3260524705395343267,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188308,0,0,0

Despite decades of research. the structural basis for PrPSc formation and prion infectivity remains elusive. To understand the role of the hydrophobic region in forming infectious prion at the molecular level. we report X-ray crystal structures of mouse (Mo) prion protein (PrP) (residues 89–230) in complex with a nanobody (Nb484). Using the recombinant prion propagation system. we show that the binding of Nb484 to the hydrophobic region of MoPrP efficiently inhibits the propagation of proteinase K resistant PrPSc and prion infectivity. In addition. when added to cultured mouse brain slices in high concentrations. Nb484 exhibits no neurotoxicity. which is drastically different from other neurotoxic anti-PrP antibodies. suggesting that the Nb484 can be a potential therapeutic agent against prion disease.

CL-induced peroxidase activity of cyt c has been found to be important for selective CL oxidation in cells undergoing programmed death.

However. it is becoming increasingly appreciated that ADMA can contribute much more to disease than simply by competitively inhibiting NOS; it can lead to NOS uncoupling. hence increasing nitrosative and oxidative stress. as well as contributing to mitochondria dysfunction. Indeed numerous roles are being discovered for ADMA in noncardiovascular diseases. including those of the lung and airways (asthma. cystic fibrosis. and COPD). and metabolism (diabetes. obesity. and metabolic syndrome).

However. MSCs are capable of releasing micro vesicles (exosomes) and extruding their mitochondria and therefore. we reasoned that this ability to transfer these organelle would represent and important mechanism for regulation of the innate immunity.

1046930,Interleukin-13 Promotes Changes in the Metabolism of Asymmetric Dimethylarginine,2020,DE Winnica and TW Yifru and F Holguin,,,,A7409-A7409,American Thoracic Society,Rationale: Asymmetric-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a specific endogenous and competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). It is synthesized during proteolysis through the action of Protein Arginine Methyl Transferases (PRMTs) and catabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). The unbalance in the synthesis and degradation of ADMA has been implicated in several clinical chronic conditions. including asthma. where it contributes to oxo-nitrosative stress. However. whether T-2 related cytokines affect ADMA metabolism in asthma is mostly unknown. We hypothesized that interleukin 13 (IL-13) increases the concentration of ADMA in airway epithelial cells by reducing the activity of DDHA-2 and increasing PRMT-2 activity.

We used activity assays. bulk FRET and single-molecule FRET (smFRET) to understand how different metal ions promote folding and self-cleavage of the Oryza sativa twister ribozyme. Although most ribozymes require additional Mg 2+ for catalysis. twister inverts this expectation. requiring 20–30 times less Mg 2+ to self-cleave than to fold. Transition metals such as Co 2+. Ni 2+ and Zn 2+ activate twister more efficiently than Mg 2+ ions. Although twister is fully active in≤ 0.5 mM MgCl 2. smFRET experiments showed that the ribozyme visits the folded state infrequently under these conditions.

Here we reveal this mechanism through extensive atomic-level simulations of arrestin. We find that the receptor’s transmembrane core and cytoplasmic tail—which bind distinct surfaces on arrestin—can each independently stimulate arrestin activation.

Upon light-induced changes in ligand–receptor interaction. movement of specific transmembrane helices within the receptor opens a crevice at the cytoplasmic surface. allowing for coupling of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins).

The molecular mechanisms underlying this activation as well as the formation and activation of brite adipocytes have gained increasing interest in recent years as they might be utilized to regulate systemic metabolism. We show here that the transcriptional regulators SRF and MKL1 both act as repressors of brown adipogenesis. Loss-of-function of these transcription factors leads to a significant induction of brown adipocyte differentiation. increased levels of UCP1 and other thermogenic genes as well as increased respiratory function. while SRF induction exerts the opposite effects. Interestingly. we observed that knockdown of MKL1 does not lead to a reduced expression of typical SRF target genes and that the SRF/MKL1 inhibitor CCG-1423 had no significant effects on brown adipocyte differentiation. Contrary. knockdown of MKL1 induces a significant increase in the transcriptional activity of PPARγ target genes and MKL1 interacts with PPARγ. suggesting that SRF and MKL1 independently inhibit brown adipogenesis and that MKL1 exerts its effect mainly by modulating PPARγ activity.,True,maQZTL0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,18,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170643,164492916850029919,/scholar?cites=164492916850029919,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170643,0,0,0

Obesity develops when energy intake chronically exceeds energy expenditure; thus. either reducing the energy intake and/or increasing the energy expenditure has been used in the treatment and prevention of obesity. On a cellular level. energy storage is mediated by white adipocyte tissue (WAT). In contrast. brown adipose tissue (BAT) contributes to body temperature and metabolic homeostasis by metabolizing lipids and glucose. Adipose tissue is a notoriously difficult tissue to work with. due to the high content of triglycerides and the fragility of the cells.

1047113,Transdifferentiation of brown adipocytes and regulation of their formation and function,2013,Matthias Hubert Rosenwald,,,,,,Brown fat or brown adipose tissue enables mammals to maintain their body temperature via non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown adipocytes are the tissue’s functional cell type and contain uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in their inner mitochondrial membrane. This unique protein allows them to efficiently convert energy from various substrates into heat. During the past years. the mechanisms underlying brown adipocyte formation and function attracted increasing scientific interest. mainly because functional brown adipocytes were found in adult humans. If it was possible to induce non-shivering thermogenesis pharmacologically. this could provide an efficient therapeutic approach against obesity and related metabolic disorders. The human brown adipocytes are located in patches within the energy-storing white adipose tissue and. similarly. brite (brown-in-white) adipocytes can be found in white adipose tissue of mice. The number of these cells increases during adaptation to colder temperatures and decreases in the warmth. A highly argued theory of their formation is that bidirectional transdifferentiation occurs. ie that white and brite adipocytes can be converted directly into the opposed cell type. In order to test this hypothesis in vivo. I generated novel transgenic mouse strains for labelling and tracing of brown and brite adipocytes. Using these strains. the changes in certain adipocyte populations were traced and the resulting cells further analysed. I could show that transdifferentiation between brite and white adipocytes indeed occurs in healthy adult mice during adaptation to changes in environmental temperature.

Recent investigations demonstrated that at least 11 of the 13 cysteine residues of the Torpedo cysteine-string protein are fatty acylated. This exceptional level of fatty acylation occurs along a short stretch (less than 25 residues) of amino acids which are flanked on either side by very polar amino and carboxy termini.

Studies of csp mutants in Drosophila reveal that csps are crucial components of the excitation-secretion machinery at nerve terminals. Current data cannot distinguish between a primary role of csps in modulating calcium ion influx at the nerve terminal versus a more-direct role in the exocytotic cascade. In this context. the remarkable post-translational modification of csps. namely the fatty acylation of as many as 12 of the 13 cysteine residues of the Torpedo protein. suggests that csps may participate more directly in the process of membrane fusion that underlies exocytosis. This would be achieved by using the fatty acyl chains of the csps as templates for ‘lipid flow’ that would allow the fusion of vesicular and plasma membranes.

However. cytosolic TCSs as compared with OCSs represent a genetic and metabolic burden to the cell: the genetic information encoding a TCS is significantly larger than that of an OCS. two or more proteins instead of one need to be synthesized for a TCS and operation of the latter system requires the expense of ATP which is not the case for most OCSs. The evolutionary advantages of cytosolic TCSs over OCSs are thus not obvious.

In order to achieve this. bacteria have developed specific adaptive mechanisms; much of the adaptive response is brought about by transcriptional activation of genes and is controlled by one or two component regulatory systems. global regulators and DNA binding proteins. The expressed gene products are then able to degrade the molecules and often take advantage of the stored energy imparted by the physicochemical properties of the hydrocarbon structure. The response of gene regulators to the presence of hydrocarbons such as toluene in the environment allows initiation or inhibition of transcription. so that the rate of synthesis of metabolically important gene products is adaptively modified.

Here we report that a defined serum free cell culture medium condition containing insulin. transferrin and selenium (ITS) supports controlled study of transcriptional regulation of de novo fatty acid (DNFA) production and de novo cholesterol synthesis (DNCS) in melanoma cell lines. This lipid-free ITS medium is able to support continuous proliferation of several melanoma cell lines that utilize DNL to support their lipid requirements. We show that the ITS medium stimulates gene transcription in support of both DNFA and DNCS. specifically mediated by SREBP1/2 in melanoma cells.

Our analysis of large public data sets yielded several useful findings. EIF4G1 frequently gains gene copies and is overexpressed to achieve characteristic stoichiometries with EIF4E and EIF4A1 in cancers. Varied expressions among EIF4F components distinguish malignant from healthy tissues. regardless of tissue or cancer types. EIF4G1 expression in particular correlates with poor prognosis. Tumors dysregulate biological ""house-keeping"" pathways typically regulated by cap-dependent initiation in healthy tissues. yet strengthen regulation of cancer-specific pathways in cap-independent contexts. In lung adenocarcinoma. altered interactions among eIF4F subunits are mechanistically linked to eIF4G1 phosphorylation.

Recombinant native-like soluble Env trimer mimetics. such as SOSIP trimers. have taken a central role in HIV-1 vaccine research aimed at inducing bNAbs. We therefore performed a direct and thorough comparison of a full-length unmodified Env trimer containing the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail. with the sequence matched soluble SOSIP trimer. both based on an early Env sequence (AMC011) from an HIV+ individual that developed bNAbs. The structures of the full-length AMC011 trimer bound to either bNAb PGT145 or PGT151 were very similar to the structures of SOSIP trimers. Antigenically. the full-length and SOSIP trimers were comparable. but in contrast to the full-length trimer. the SOSIP trimer did not bind at all to non-neutralizing antibodies. most likely as a consequence of the intrinsic stabilization of the SOSIP trimer. Furthermore. the glycan composition of full-length and SOSIP trimers was similar overall. but the SOSIP trimer possessed slightly less complex and less extensively processed glycans. which may relate to the intrinsic stabilization as well as the absence of the membrane tether.

Scalable. sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven straightforward; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect.  Methods: We systemically developed an ELISA assay. optimising different antigens and amplification steps. in serum and saliva from symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects.  Results: Using trimeric spike glycoprotein. rather than nucleocapsid enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens. but more anti-spike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in hospitalized patients. Anti-spike. but not nucleocapsid. IgG. IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from non-hospitalized symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Antibody responses in saliva and serum were largely independent of each other and symptom reporting.  Conclusions. Detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum is optimal for determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Funding.

1047279,Enhancing glycan occupancy of soluble HIV-1 envelope trimers to mimic the native viral spike,2020,,,bioRXIV,,,,The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is decorated with N-linked glycans. which are attached to asparagine residues in the amino acid sequon NxT/S by oligosaccharyltransferases (OST). Artificial glycan holes exist when a PNGS is under-occupied on recombinant Env-based vaccines. but not on their viral counterpart. Native-like SOSIP trimers. including clinical candidates. have these artificial holes in the glycan shield that induce strain-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or non-NAbs. To increase PNGS occupancy. eliminate artificial glycan holes. and mimic the glycosylation of native BG505 Env. we replaced all 12 NxS sequons on the BG505 SOSIP trimer with NxT. thereby increasing the affinity of the sequons for OST. All PNGS. except N133 and N160. were nearly fully occupied on the modified trimer. Occupancy of the N133 site could be increased by changing N133 to NxS. while occupancy of the N160 site could be restored by reverting the nearby N156 sequon to NxS. Hence. OST affinity can influence glycan occupancy when two PNGS are in close proximity.

However. it is unknown whether this pattern may have short-term consequences on the ECS in the spleen. To address this question. we examined the plasma concentrations of metabolic and inflammatory signals and the splenic ECS in early adult rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence. A 4-day drinking in the dark (DID) procedure for 4 weeks was used as a model of intermittent forced-alcohol administration (20%. v/v) in female and male Wistar rats. which were sacrificed 2 weeks after the last DID session. First. there was no liver damage or alterations in plasma metabolic parameters. However. certain plasma inflammatory signals were altered according to sex and alcohol exposition. Whereas fractalkine [chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1] was only affected by sex with lower concentration in male rats. there was an interaction between sex and alcohol exposure in the TNF-α and interleukin-6 concentrations and only female rats displayed changes. Regarding the mRNA and protein expression of the ECS. the receptors and endocannabinoid-synthesizing enzymes were found to be altered with area-specific expression patterns in the spleen. Overall. whereas the expression of the cannabinoid receptor CB1 and the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARα were lower in alcohol-exposed rats compared to control rats. the CB2 expression was higher.

Among them. the anti-inflammatory N-acyl ethanolamide (NAE)-peroxisome proliferators activated receptor alpha (PPARα) system has gained much interest after the identification of its protective role in steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. An overdose of paracetamol (APAP). a commonly used analgesic/antipyretic drug. causes hepatotoxicity. and it is being used as a liver model. In the present study. we have analysed the impact of APAP on the liver NAE-PPARα system. A dose-response (0.5-5-10-20 mM) and time-course (2-6-24 hours) study in human HepG2 cells showed a biphasic response. with a decreased PPARα expression after 6-hour APAP incubation followed by a generalized increase of NAE-PPARα system-related components (PPARα.

It is therefore essential that we are able to detect these potential therapeutic agents. In our project. we are using a strategy based on the multifuntionalisation of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) combining diagnostic and therapeutic techniques against breast and pancreatic cancer (2). The aim of the present study was to assess and validate the particle electron paramagnetic resonance (pEPR) technique in a biodistribution study by means of in vivo MRI scans. and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). as analytical gold standard technique. Here we present an alternative analytical method for detecting SPIO in vitro and ex vivo that is inexpensive and rapid (no sample preparation).

In pEPR a radio frequency excitation is applied at the resonant frequency and the received signal is a measure for the amount of SPIO present in the sample.Materials and Methods: Quantitative validation of the pEPR technique was carried out by comparing pEPR and ICP-MS measurements using reference samples (in blood. plasma and saline) containing known quantities of SPIO.

Squalene arises from an initial condensation of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form presqualene diphosphate (PSPP). which then undergoes a reductive rearrangement to form squalene. In principle. botryococcene could arise from an alternative rearrangement of the presqualene intermediate. Because of these proposed similarities. we predicted that a botryococcene synthase would resemble squalene synthase and hence isolated squalene synthase-like genes from Botryococcus braunii race B. While B. braunii does harbor at least one typical squalene synthase. none of the other three squalene synthase-like (SSL) genes encodes for botryococcene biosynthesis directly.

Even in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). only approximately 40% of enzyme- and transporter-encoding genes have credible functional annotations. and this number is even lower in nonmodel plants.

Thiamin consists of thiazole and pyrimidine moieties. Its high biosynthetic cost stems from use of the suicide enzyme THI4 to form the thiazole and the near-suicide enzyme THIC to form the pyrimidine. These energetic costs lower biomass yield potential and are likely compounded by environmental stresses that destroy thiamin and hence increase the rate at which it must be made. The energy costs could be slashed by refactoring the thiamin biosynthesis pathway to eliminate the suicidal THI4 and THIC reactions. To substantiate this design concept. we first document the energetic costs of the THI4 and THIC steps in the pathway and explain how cutting these costs could substantially increase crop biomass and grain yields …,True,hswBMLYAAAAJ:MDX3w3dAD3YC,14,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016894521731169X,336271317660409181,/scholar?cites=336271317660409181,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeffrey_Amthor/publication/322945406_Redesigning_thiamin_synthesis_Prospects_and_potential_payoffs/links/5cb96aa492851c8d22f5c8f4/Redesigning-thiamin-synthesis-Prospects-and-potential-payoffs.pdf,0,0,0

This family possesses an interesting spectrum of biological activities. including antioxidative. antibacterial. anti-inflammatory. anticancer. cytotoxic. and immunosuppressive potential. Compounds of this family have been shown to interfere with each step of carcinogenesis. including initiation. promotion and progression. Moreover. numerous compounds from the family of dietary chalcones appear to show activity against cancer cells. suggesting that these molecules or their derivatives may be considered as potential anticancer drugs. This review will focus primarily on prominent members of the chalcone family with an 1.3-diphenyl-2-propenon core structure.

Recently. novel FDA-approved drugs derived from marine sponges have been shown to reduce metastatic breast cancer. malignant lymphoma. and Hodgkin’s disease. Despite the fact that many marine natural products have been shown to possess a good inhibition potential against most of the cancer-related cell signaling pathways. only a few marine natural products have been shown to target JAK/STAT signaling.

The peripheral pathway for the anaerobic oxidation of toluene in bacteria consists of an initial activation catalyzed by a benzylsuccinate synthase (encoded by bss genes). and a subsequent modified -oxidation of benzylsuccinate to benzoyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA (encoded by bbs genes). We have shown here that the bss and bbs genes. which are located within an integrative and conjugative element. are essential for anaerobic degradation of toluene but also for m-xylene oxidation in the denitrifying beta-proteobacterium Azoarcus sp. CIB. New insights into the transcriptional organization and regulation of a complete gene cluster for anaerobic catabolism of toluene/m-xylene in a single bacterial strain are presented. The bss and bbs genes are transcriptionally coupled into two large convergent catabolic operons driven by the PbssD and PbbsA promoters. respectively. whose expression is inducible when cells grow anaerobically in toluene or m-xylene. An adjacent tdiSR operon driven by the PtdiS promoter encodes a putative two-component regulatory system. TdiR behaves as a transcriptional activator of the PbssD. PbbsA. and PtdiS promoters. being benzylsuccinate/(3-methyl)benzylsuccinate. rather than toluene /m-xylene. the inducers that may trigger the TdiS-mediated activation of TdiR.

This pushes for the development of alternative antimicrobials. such as bacteriophage-encoded endolysins. also called enzybiotics. This antibacterial approach. rooted in phage therapy. could pose a new and valuable adding to the antimicrobial arsenal. with increased specificity and much lower chances of enabling bacterial escape and resistance mechanisms when compared to antibiotics [2]. Endolysins are usually comprised of a cell wall binding domain (CWBD) and one or several catalytic domains that cleave the bacterial cell wall. Both rational design and domain shuffling have proved to be effective approaches towards the improvement of phage endolysins for therapeutic uses [3]. Thus. the aim of this work is to construct new endolysins active against a range of pathogenic bacteria by switching protein domains.Methods: A new lysin. termed Csl2 was designed by fusing the catalytic lysozyme domain of Cpl-7. encoded by pneumococcal phage Cp-7 [3]. and the CWBD from LySMP. encoded by Streptococcus suis phage SMP [4]. The gene encoding the chimeric enzyme was cloned in the expression vector pT7-7. overexpressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and the protein Csl2 purified following a two-step chromatographic procedure.

India [etc.] International Society for Tropical Ecology. 1961-,Most soils in the tropics are deficient in nitrogen. phosphorus or both (Sanchez & Logan 1992) and can not support sustainable crop production without external inputs of inorganic fertilizer (Mafongoya et al. 1998). Small scale farmers in the tropics have limited access to inorganic fertilizer due to high costs. in some cases. unavailability of such fertilizers (Mafongoya et al. 1998). Alley cropping is a system in which arable crops are grown in the spaces between two rows of planted woody leguminous shrub which is pruned periodically during cropping season to prevent shading and provide green manure which upon decomposition provides nutrients to companion crops (Bross et al. 1995; Lehmann et al. 1995; Mafongoya et al. 1998). In a previous study. Pandey et al.(1998) found that Leucaena prunings did not support the growth of maize crop in a Leucaena based alley-cropping system. This stimulated us to investigate decomposition timing (percent weight loss) and nitrogen release pattern from Leucaena because these parameters help deciding time of green manuring and thereby regulating the synchronization in nitrogen release and its uptake by crops in the system. Objective of this study was to investigate moss loss and nitrogen release patterns from leaves and twigs of L. leucocephala (Lam) De Wit in a Leucaena based alley cropping system.

This widely observed pattern in everyday life occurs due to the phenomenon known as a coffee stain (or coffee ring) effect. While the droplet dries. the capillary flow moves and deposits the particles toward the pinned edges. which shows a 2D ring-like structure. Here we demonstrate the transition from a 2D to a 3D coffee stain that has a well-defined and hollow sphere-like structure. when the substrate surface is switched from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic. The 3D stain formation starts with the evaporation of the pinned aqueous colloidal droplet placed on a superhydrophobic surface that facilitates the particle flow towards the liquid–air interface. This leads to spherical skin formation and a cavity in the droplet.

Gurkaslar and EN Firat-Karalar,,PLOS Biology,,e3000679,,Centriolar satellites are dynamic. membraneless granules composed of over 200 proteins. They store. modify. and traffic centrosome and primary cilium proteins. and help to regulate both the biogenesis and some functions of centrosomes and cilium. In most cell types. satellites cluster around the perinuclear centrosome. but their integrity and cellular distribution are dynamically remodeled in response to different stimuli. such as cell cycle cues. Dissecting the specific and temporal functions and mechanisms of satellites and how these are influenced by their cellular positioning and dynamics has been challenging using genetic approaches. particularly in ciliated and proliferating cells. To address this. we developed a chemical-based trafficking assay to rapidly and efficiently redistribute satellites to either the cell periphery or center. and fuse them into stable clusters in a temporally controlled way. Induced satellite clustering at either the periphery or center resulted in antagonistic changes in the pericentrosomal levels of a subset of proteins. revealing a direct and selective role for their positioning in protein targeting and sequestration. Systematic analysis of the interactome of peripheral satellite clusters revealed enrichment of proteins implicated in cilium biogenesis and mitosis. Importantly. induction of peripheral satellite targeting in ciliated cells revealed a function for satellites not just for efficient cilium assembly but also in the maintenance of steady-state cilia and in cilia disassembly by regulating the structural integrity of the ciliary axoneme.

Although AURKA overexpression is frequent in human cancers. its pleiotropic functions and complex spatiotemporal regulation have presented challenges in its therapeutic targeting. An essential step to overcome these challenges is the identification of the full range of AURKA regulators and substrates. which are often weak and transient. Previous proteomic studies were limited in monitoring dynamic and non-mitotic AURKA interactions. Here. we generated the first in vivo proximity interactome of AURKA. which consisted of 247 proteins involving multiple biological processes and cellular compartments. Importantly. AURKA had extensive proximity interactions to centriolar satellites. key regulators of the primary cilium. Affinity pulldown and phosphoproteomics experiments confirmed this proximity relationship at the physical level. Loss-of-function experiments defined satellites as negative regulators of AURKA activity. abundance and localization in quiescent cells. Notably. loss of satellites increased AURKA activation at the basal body and resulted in defective cilium assembly and enhanced cilium disassembly.

When embryos are isolated from the grain and incubated in media for 4 d the TAG content is affected in three ways. In the basal medium (dilute buffer) the content falls; in 30 mM sucrose the content remains unchanged; in sucrose supplemented with an osmoticum (400 mM mannitol) or abscisic acid (1 μM ABA) the TAG content increases. Effective osmotic potentials and ABA concentrations fit well with their respective values in planta. The fatty-acid composition of TAG accumulated in vitro is close to that in planta but in the absence of ABA or osmoticum there is a fall in the C18∶C16 ratio.

Postirradiation analyses using enantioselective multidimensional GC revealed energy‐controlled ee values of up to 4.2 %. which correlate with theoretical predictions based on newly recorded anisotropy spectra g(λ).

1047857,Understanding photochirogenesis: Solvent effects on circular dichroism and anisotropy spectroscopy,2014,Jan Hendrik Bredehöft and Nykola C Jones and Cornelia Meinert and Amanda C Evans and Søren V Hoffmann and Uwe J Meierhenrich,26,Chirality,8,373-378,,The basic units that constitute essential biopolymers (proteins and nucleic acids) are enantiomerically biased. Proteins are constructed from L‐amino acids and nucleic acids possess a backbone composed exclusively of D‐sugars. Photochirogenesis has been postulated to be the source of this homochirality of biomolecules: Asymmetric photochemical reactions were catalyzed by circularly polarized light (cpl) in interstellar environments and generated the first chiral prebiotic precursors. Enantiomers absorb cpl differently and this difference can dictate the kinetics of asymmetric photochemical reactions. These differences in absorption can be studied using circular dichroism (CD) and anisotropy spectroscopy. Rather than measuring the CD spectrum alone. the anisotropy factor g is recorded (CD divided by absorption). This factor g is directly related to the maximum achievable enantiomeric excess.

Cham,All biopolymers are composed of homochiral building blocks. and both d-sugars and l-amino acids uniquely constitute life on Earth. These monomers were originally enantiomerically differentiated under prebiotic conditions. Particular progress has recently been made in support of the photochemical model for this differentiation: the interaction of circularly polarized light with racemic molecules is currently thought to have been the original source for life’s biological homochirality. The differential asymmetric photoreactivity of particular small molecules can be characterized by both circular dichroism and anisotropy spectroscopy. Anisotropy spectroscopy. a novel derivative of circular dichroism spectroscopy. records the anisotropy factor g = Δε/ε as a function of the wavelength.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Amino acids are the fundamental building blocks of proteins. the biomolecules that provide cellular structure and function in all living organisms. A majority of amino acids utilized within living systems possess pre-specified orientation geometry (chirality); however the original source for this specific orientation remains uncertain. In order to trace the chemical evolution of life. an appreciation of the synthetic and evolutional origins of the first chiral amino acids must first be gained. Given that the amino acids in our universe are likely to have been synthesized in molecular clouds in interstellar space. it is necessary to understand where and how the first synthesis might have occurred. The asymmetry of the original amino acid synthesis was probably the result of exposure to chiral photons in the form of circularly polarized light (CPL). which has been detected in interstellar molecular clouds.
