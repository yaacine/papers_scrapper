1089707,A cellular tensegrity model to analyse the structural viscoelasticity of the cytoskeleton,2002,Patrick Canadas and Valerie M Laurent and Christian Oddou and Daniel Isabey and Sylvie Wendling,218,Journal of Theoretical Biology,2,155-173,Academic Press,This study describes the viscoelastic properties of a refined cellular-tensegrity model composed of six rigid bars connected to a continuous network of 24 viscoelastic pre-stretched cables (Voigt bodies) in order to analyse the role of the cytoskeleton spatial rearrangement on the viscoelastic response of living adherent cells. This structural contribution was determined from the relationships between the global viscoelastic properties of the tensegrity model. i.e.. normalized viscosity modulus (η*). normalized elasticity modulus (E*). and the physical properties of the constitutive elements. i.e.. their normalized length (L*) and normalized initial internal tension (T*). We used a numerical method to simulate the deformation of the structure in response to different types of loading. while varying by several orders of magnitude L* and T*. The numerical results obtained reveal that η* remains almost independent of changes in T …,True,PgBuKe4AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,128,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251930293064X,4878898068015243401,/scholar?cites=4878898068015243401,,https://www.imechanica.org/files/CanadasJTB2002.pdf,0,0,0

F-actin structure characterizing each CSK component was visualized from spatial reconstructions at low and high density. respectively. especially in a 10-μm-cubic neighborhood including the bead. Specific mechanical properties (Young elastic and viscous modulus E and η) were revealed after partitioning the magnetic twisting cytometry response using a double viscoelastic “solid” model with asymmetric plastic relaxation. Results show that the cortical CSK response is a faster (τ 1≤ 0.7s). softer (E1: 63-109 Pa). moderately viscous (η1: 7-18 Pa s). slightly tensed. and easily damaged structure compared to the deep CSK structure which appears …,True,PgBuKe4AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,70,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1114/1.1616932,16053557965451582632,/scholar?cites=16053557965451582632,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emmanuelle_Planus/publication/8980828_Partitioning_of_Cortical_and_Deep_Cytoskeleton_Responses_from_Transient_Magnetic_Bead_Twisting/links/0fcfd50fe523d928c5000000/Partitioning-of-Cortical-and-Deep-Cytoskeleton-Responses-from-Transient-Magnetic-Bead-Twisting.pdf,0,0,0
1089709,Mechanical model of cytoskeleton structuration during cell adhesion and spreading,2008,Bernard Maurin and Patrick Cañadas and Haimad Baudriller and Philippe Montcourrier and Nadir Bettache,41,Journal of biomechanics,9,2036-2041,Elsevier,The biomechanical behavior of an adherent cell is intimately dependent on its cytoskeleton structure. Several models have been proposed to study this structure taking into account its existing internal forces. However. the structural and geometrical complexities of the cytoskeleton's filamentous networks lead to difficulties for determining a biologically realistic architecture. The objective of this paper is to present a mechanical model. combined with a numerical method. devoted to the form-finding of the cytoskeleton structure (shape and internal forces) when a cell adheres on a substrate. The cell is modeled as a granular medium. using rigid spheres (grains) corresponding to intracellular cross-linking proteins and distant mechanical interactions to reproduce the cytoskeleton filament internal forces. At the initial state (i.e.. before adhesion). these interactions are tacit.

1089710,Frequency response of a viscoelastic tensegrity model: Structural rearrangement contribution to cell dynamics,2006,Patrick Cañadas and Sylvie Wendling-Mansuy and Daniel Isabey,128,Journal of biomechanical engineering,4,487-495,American Society of Mechanical Engineers,In an attempt to understand the role of structural rearrangement onto the cell response during imposed cyclic stresses. we simulated numerically the frequency-dependent behavior of a viscoelastic tensegrity structure (VTS model) made of 24 elastic cables and 6 rigid bars. The VTS computational model was based on the nonsmooth contact dynamics (NSCD) method in which the constitutive elements of the tensegrity structure are considered as a set of material points that mutually interact. Low amplitude oscillatory loading conditions were applied and the frequency response of the overall structure was studied in terms of frequency dependence of mechanical properties. The latter were normalized by the homogeneous properties of constitutive elements in order to capture the essential feature of spatial rearrangement. The results reveal a specific frequency-dependent contribution of elastic and viscous effects which …,True,PgBuKe4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,47,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/biomechanical/article-abstract/128/4/487/475069,11478569020624667866,/scholar?cites=11478569020624667866,,,0,0,0

Using magnetic twisting cytometry in which beads are attached to integrin receptors linked to the actin CSK of living adherent epithelial cells. we specifically measured the elastic CSK response at quasi equilibrium state and partitioned this response in terms of cortical and cytosolic contributions with a two-component model (i.e.. a series of two Voigt bodies).

Tensegrity systems have already demonstrated their pertinence for this purpose. However. the structures considered until now are based only on models with simplified geometry and topology compared to the true complexity of cytoskeleton architecture. The aim of this Note is to propose a form-finding method for generating nonregular tensegrity shapes of higher diversity and complexity. The process relies on the use of the dynamic relaxation method. Further improvements have made it possible to control the computed morphologies and to modify them to approach experimentally observed configurations.

1089713,Experimental and numerical identification of cortical bone permeability,2008,Etienne Malachanne and David Dureisseix and Patrick Cañadas and Franck Jourdan,41,Journal of biomechanics,3,721-725,Elsevier,Bone is a complex system. and could be modeled as a poroelastic media. The aim of this paper is to identify the macroscopic value of the cortical bone permeability coefficient. A simple experimental method was designed in order to determine the permeability coefficient. Two bone samples taken from different ox femurs were filled with water. to place them under internal pressure. The measurements gave both the fluid flow through the lateral surfaces and the internal pressure. The originality of this work is the coupling between an experimental process and a structural computation performed with a finite element method. The mean cortical bone permeability coefficient identified was about k= 1.1× 10-13 m 2. This value tends to confirm other values found in the literature. obtained by different methods and often at macroscopic scale.

In particular. the role of the mechanical interactions occurring in this process needs to be better understood and studied. Inner follicular cells surrounding the oocytes of Ciona intestinalis form an epithelial monolayer resulting from an accretion process (without mitosis or apoptosis). This epithelium is elementary and useful for morphogenesis studies: the cells exhibit polygon packing with a specific but non-systematically repeatable topology (i.e. the distribution of pentagons. hexagons and heptagons changes).

One of the most widely used in vitro model to study cartilage growth is the model of mesenchymal stromal cells-derived cartilage micropellet.

The DW factor for nominal value of 0.286 nm meridional diffraction representing a period along the helical axis of a collagen molecule was measured. As the atomic scattering factor of mineral constituents is much larger than that of collagen. it is difficult to detect the diffraction from collagen in bone specimen. Therefore. PDB was used in this study. In order to compare obtained force constant value for CDB with mechanical properties of collagen in the literature. the value was translated into Young's modulus value using the cross-sectional area of a collagen molecule.

In this paper. we report the expression patterns of xSDF-1α. xCXCR4 and xCXCR7 and regulation of the expression of xSDF-1α and xCXCR4 during gastrulation. We performed whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses to examine the distribution of transcripts. The effect of activin/nodal signaling on the expression of xSDF-1α and its receptors was examined by animal cap assay and microinjection of cer-s mRNA. We have demonstrated that the xSDF-1α transcript is increased in the blastocoel roof during gastrulation. but not in the involuted mesoderm. xCXCR4 was expressed in the mesendoderm at late blastula and was retained throughout gastrulation. xCXCR7 was found in the dorsal lip around the blastopore in the early gastrula stage and became localized in the presumptive notochord later. We also show that the expression of xCXCR4 and xSDF-1α were reciprocally regulated by activin/nodal signaling. These results suggest that xSDF-1α and its receptors contribute to the cell arrangement of mesoderm cells and their expression patterns are partially regulated by activin/nodal signaling.,True,V1TUmrkAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,7,http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper/120130af,7528633337557152289,/scholar?cites=7528633337557152289,,http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/descarga/paper/120130af,0,0,0

Members of the Nodal-related subclass of the TGF-β superfamily induce and pattern the mesoderm and endoderm in all vertebrates. In zebrafish. two nodal-related genes. called squint and cyclops. are required in a dosage-dependent manner for the formation of all derivatives of the mesoderm and endoderm. These genes are expressed dynamically during the blastula stages and may have different roles at different times. This question has been difficult to address because conditions that alter the timing of nodal-related gene expression also change Nodal levels.

Elevated ROS is linked to impairments in mitochondrial damage recovery responses and is often tied to disruption in mitochondrial-targeted autophagy known as mitophagy. In this study. we sought to identify a mechanistic connection between KLF4 and mitophagy.

1089778,Thermal conductivity of nanoparticles filled polymers,2012,Hassan Ebadi-Dehaghani and Mehra Nazempour,,,,,InTech,Thermal conductivity of polymers is an important thermal property for both polymer applications and processing. Polymers typically have intrinsic thermal conductivity much lower than those for metals or ceramic materials. and therefore are good thermal insulators. Further enhancement of this thermal insulating quality can be achieved by foaming polymers. In other applications which require higher thermal conductivity. such as in electronic packaging and encapsulations. satellite devices. and in areas where good heat dissipation. low thermal expansion and light weight are needed. polymers reinforced with fillers. organic or inorganic. are becoming more and more common in producing advanced polymer composites for these applications (Hodgin & Estes. 1999; Tavman. 2004; Lee & Eun. 2004; Liu & Mather. 2004; Ishida & Heights. 1999; Frank & Phillip. 2002; Hermansen. 2001; Ishida. 2000). Most polymeric materials are processed and fabricated at elevated temperatures. often above their melting temperatures. This process may be long and expensive because of the low thermal conductivity of polymers. Subsequently. the cooling process or annealing may also be controlled by heat transport properties of polymers. which eventually affect the physical properties of the materials. One example is crystalline polymers. for which the structural and morphological features may be significantly changed with the speed of cooling.

Current strategies to control biofilm proliferation are typically based on biocides. which exhibit a negative environmental impact. In the search for environmentally friendly solutions. nanotechnology opens the possibility to control the interaction between biological systems and colonized surfaces by introducing nanostructured coatings that have the potential to affect bacterial adhesion by modifying surface properties at the same scale. In this work. we present a study on the performance of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride coatings (h-BN) to reduce biofilm formation. In contraposition to planktonic state. we focused on evaluating the efficiency of graphene and h-BN at the irreversible stage of biofilm formation. where most of the biocide solutions have a poor performance. A wild Enterobacter cloacae strain was isolated. from fouling found in a natural environment. and used in these experiments. According to our results. graphene and h-BN coatings modify surface energy and electrostatic interactions with biological systems. This nanoscale modification determines a significant reduction in biofilm formation at its irreversible stage. No bactericidal effects were found. suggesting both coatings offer a biocompatible solution for biofilm and fouling control in a wide range of applications.

1089791,Characterizing HSF1 binding and post-translational modifications of hsp70 promoter in cultured cortical neurons: Implications in the heat-shock response,2015,Andrea V Gomez and Gonzalo Cordova and Roberto Munita and Guillermo E Parada and Alvaro P Barrios and Gonzalo I Cancino and Alejandra R Alvarez and Maria E Andres,10,PLoS One,6,e0129329,Public Library of Science,Causes of lower induction of Hsp70 in neurons during heat shock are still a matter of debate. To further inquire into the mechanisms regulating Hsp70 expression in neurons. we studied the activity of Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) and histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) at the hsp70 promoter in rat cortical neurons. Heat shock induced a transient and efficient translocation of HSF1 to neuronal nuclei. However. no binding of HSF1 at the hsp70 promoter was detected while it bound to the hsp25 promoter in cortical neurons during heat shock. Histone PTMs analysis showed that the hsp70 promoter harbors lower levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation in cortical neurons compared to PC12 cells under basal conditions. Transcriptomic profiling data analysis showed a predominant usage of cryptic transcriptional start sites at hsp70 gene in the rat cerebral cortex. compared with the whole brain. These data support a weaker activation of hsp70 canonical promoter. Heat shock increased H3Ac at the hsp70 promoter in PC12 cells. which correlated with increased Hsp70 expression while no modifications occurred at the hsp70 promoter in cortical neurons. Increased histone H3 acetylation by Trichostatin A led to hsp70 mRNA and protein induction in cortical neurons. In conclusion. we found that two independent mechanisms maintain a lower induction of Hsp70 in cortical neurons. First. HSF1 fails to bind specifically to the hsp70 promoter in cortical neurons during heat shock and. second. the hsp70 promoter is less accessible in neurons compared to non-neuronal cells due to histone deacetylases repression.,True,LYFD1wkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,5,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129329,12015462255103383529,/scholar?cites=12015462255103383529,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129329,0,0,0

Lignocellulose is a promising feedstock. but the lignin–cellulose–hemicellulose biomass complex requires chemical pre-treatment to yield fermentable saccharides. including cellulose-derived cellobiose. prior to bioproduction of acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) and hydrogen. Fermentation capability is limited by lignin and thus process optimization requires knowledge of lignin inhibition. The effects of lignin on cellular metabolism were evaluated for C. acetobutylicum grown on medium containing either cellobiose only or cellobiose plus lignin. Microscopy. gas chromatography and 8-plex iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic technologies were applied to interrogate the effect of lignin on cellular morphology. fermentation and the proteome. Our results demonstrate that C. acetobutylicum has reduced performance for solvent production when lignin is present in the medium.

This research demonstrated that BSAM-based pretreatment significantly increased the digestibility and surface area of the lignocellulosic material and considerably enhanced biomethanation.

1089833,Characterising Cellulolytic and Biofuel Generating Bacteria using Proteomics for Future Implementation as Biofuel Producers,2014,Mahendra Raut,,,,,,In natural ecosystems. microbes are mostly found in diverse and complex communities or consortia that can live symbiotically and fulfil most important global biogeochemical cycles. These processes are very difficult or impossible to achieve by a single bacterium. At the global level. scientists have come to know the innate capacity of natural microbial consortia and are starting to understand natural communities and to develop recombinant synthetic consortia for future biotechnology application. In order to overcome key challenges arising due to fossil fuel depletion and contribution to global warming. consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is thought to be a low cost processing scheme for lignocellulosic biofuel production. Consortia of cellulolytic and biofuel producing microorganisms could be an attractive alternative to single organism approaches. However. proper understanding of the biology of native microbes and their implementation in the development of consortia needs rigorous research study at the system-wide level. Given the immense potential in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels. anaerobic microorganisms are of great interest to researchers. Therefore. this research is focussed on two different anaerobic bacteria: Fibrobacter succinogenes S85. which is an efficient cellulose degrader. but cannot produce biofuels; and Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. a promising solvents (acetone. ethanol. butanol) producing bacterium that cannot degrade cellulose. The study of these microbes at the systems level will help to understand the biological complexity of these microbes and provide valuable information for future CBP …,True,nKnAYtIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6404/1/MPR_PhD_thesis%20final.pdf,,,,https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6404/1/MPR_PhD_thesis%20final.pdf,0,0,0

Fourty female Wistar Albino rats. 10-12 weeks old. were used. Ovary and uterus tissues were fixed in Mota s fixative for 48 h and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 6 µm thickness were cut and stained with toluidine blue (1% aqueous solution) and Alcian blue-safranin (pH: 1.0. buffered by using 0.1 N HCl). In the ovary. the mast cells were mainly present in the tunica albuginea. in the interstitial areas between follicles or corpora lutea and in the vicinity of blood vessels in the medulla. The number of mast cells in the ovarian medulla and cortex and the uterine endometrium and myometrium were highest in the oestrous. metaoestrous. oestrous and metaoestrous phases. respectively. The number of mast cells was higher in the ovarian medulla (7.4±0.52) and cortex (2.1±0.30) during oestrus rather than in other phases of the oestrous cycle (P< 0.05). with the highest number in the endometrium during the oestrous (6.8±0.45) and metaoestrous (6.2±0.56) and in the myometrium (7.1±0.63 for oestrous. 7.5±0.33 for metaoestrous) of uterus compared to other phases of the cycle (P< 0.05). Safranin-stained mast cells were numerous in all tissues during all stages of the oestrous cycle except the proestrous. Mast cells were safranin positive in the myometrium only during proestrous.

Four Van Cats were used in the study. Appropriate sized pieces were taken from the lungs and tracheas of the cats. After BLA (Basic Lead Acetate-Mota) was set. it was blocked with paraplast by doing the routine tissue follow-up. Sections taken in 6-7 μm thickness were stained with 0. 5% toluidine blue and alcian-blue safranin O combined stain. Numbers of mast cells were specified semi-quantitatively in the sections stained with toluidine blue under lens 40. Among analysed organs. the most mast cells were found in lungs. To specify the granule construction. BLA detection was determined to be suitable. In the stain of Alcianblue safranin O. SO (+).

We found that the release of the drug from a liposome depends on the degree of penetration of bile salts. Among the three bile salts. deoxycholate was most effective in releasing the drug from the hydrocarbon core of the liposome because of its high insertion ability owing to its maximum hydrophobicity.

It was observed that HSA penetrates into the liposomes through hydrophobic interaction which reduces the packing order of the lipid bi-layer and leads to a quenching in fluorescence intensity of ellipticine. DPPC is more dehydrated hence more hydrophobic due to its higher phase transition temperature (42 °C) as compared to that of DMPC (23 °C). Therefore. HSA exhibits more affinity towards DPPC than it does towards DMPC.

Because ellipticine exists in various prototropic forms under physiological conditions. we performed comparative photophysical and dynamical studies on these prototropic species in different bile salts varying in their head groups and hydrophobic skeletons. We found that the initial interaction between ellipticine and bile salts is governed by the electrostatic forces where cationic ellipticine is anchored to the head groups of bile salts. Bile salts having conjugated head groups are better candidates to bind with the cationic species than those having the non-conjugated ones.

The conventional scene flow methods are difficult to use in reallife applications due to their long computational overhead. We propose a conditional adversarial network SceneFlowGAN for scene flow estimation. The proposed SceneFlowGAN uses loss function at two ends: both generator and descriptor ends. The proposed network is the first attempt to estimate scene flow using generative adversarial networks. and is able to estimate both the optical flow and disparity from the input stereo images simultaneously.

Y527 phosphorylation stabilizes a closed conformation. which suppresses kinase activity towards substrates. whereas phosphorylation at Y416 promotes an elevated kinase activity by stabilizing the activation loop in a manner permissive for substrate binding. Here we investigated the correlation of Y416 phosphorylation with c-Src activity when c-Src was locked into the open and closed conformations (by mutations Y527F and Q528E. P529E. G530I respectively). Consistent with prior findings. we found Y416 to be more greatly phosphorylated when c-Src was in an open. active conformation. However. we also observed an appreciable amount of Y416 was phosphorylated when c-Src was in a closed. repressed conformation under conditions by which c-Src was unable to phosphorylate substrate STAT3. The phosphorylation of Y416 in the closed conformation arose by autophosphorylation. since abolishing kinase activity by mutating the ATP binding site (K295M) prevented phosphorylation. Basal Y416 phosphorylation correlated positively with cellular levels of c-Src suggesting autophosphorylation depended on self-association. Using sedimentation velocity analysis on cell lysate with fluorescence detection optics. we confirmed that c-Src forms monomers and dimers. with the open conformation also forming a minor population of larger mass complexes. Collectively. our studies suggest a model by which dimerization of c-Src primes c-Src via Y416 phosphorylation to enable rapid potentiation of activity when Src adopts an open conformation.

Autophagy. a recycling process that maintains cellular homoeostasis during differentiation and development. is controversial regarding increased or decreased autophagic activity in preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to determine whether autophagy is increased in the placentas of women with preeclampsia by examining the protein levels of autophagy markers (Beclin 1 and SQSTM1/p62) and phosphorylation of cyclin E. For this purpose. placentas from preeclampsia (n= 10) and control (n= 10) pregnancies were included in this study. The protein expression of autophagy-related markers Beclin1. SQSTM1/p62 and phosphorylation status of cyclin E were detected by Western blot. Our data showed that the protein levels of both Beclin 1 and SQSTM1/p62 were significantly increased. while the phosphorylation level of cyclin E was significantly decreased in placentas with preeclampsia compared to those derived from controls.

Although. the pathogenesis of BD remains poorly understood. excessive or dysregulatedcytokine production including IL-10 is associated with BD. Revealing the key molecular mechanism by which IL-10 expression is regulated is crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of BD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Src family kinases (SFKs) are upstream mediators of STAT3/IL-10 pathway in peripheral blood mono nuclear cells (PBMCs) of active BD patients. Twenty active BD patients and twenty healthy subjects used as control were included in the study. PBMCs were isolated from total blood by density gradient centrifugation.

Inhibition of SFKs activity suppressed LPS-induced IL-10 production in PBMCs fromboth controls and active BD patients. Similarly. blockage of STAT3 activation abrogated LPS-induced IL-10 production. However. LPS-induced STAT3 activation required for IL-10 production was found to be dependent on SFKs activity as LPS-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was reduced by the inhibition of SFKs activity in PBMCs of active BD patients.

Several studies reported that breast cancer cases in younger women have different biological characteristics than others. These patients should be studied separately. Lack of the necessary information about the younger patients prevents significant improvements about diagnosis and treatment strategies targeting these patients. Polymorphisms within intron 2 of the FGFR2 gene have been associated with postmenopausal breast cancer patients in many populations.

We investigated BSP gene transcription by performing functional analysis of the 9256 bp of the 5′ flanking region of the murine BSP gene containing its promoter.

C. elegans germ granules. known as P granules. do not appear to be required for primordial germ cell (PGC) determination [3]. but their components are still needed for fertility [4. 5. 6]. One potential role for P granules is to maintain germline fate and totipotency. This is suggested by the loss of P granules from germ cells that transform into somatic cell types. e.g.. in germlines lacking MEX-3 and GLD-1 or upon neuronal induction by CHE-1 [7. 8].

In the quest to extend lifespan. a possible strategy is to drive germ-line traits in somatic cells. to try to confer some of the germ lineage’s immortality on the somatic body. Notably. a study in Caenorhabditis elegans suggested that expression of germ-line genes in the somatic cells of long-lived daf-2 mutants confers some of daf-2’s long lifespan. Specifically. mRNAs encoding components of C. elegans germ granules (P granules) were up-regulated in daf-2 mutant worms. and knockdown of individual P-granule and other germ-line genes in daf-2 young adults modestly reduced their lifespan. We investigated the contribution of a germ-line program to daf-2’s long lifespan and also tested whether other mutants known to express germ-line genes in their somatic cells are long-lived.

Inc.,CIP75 is a member of the UbL(ubiquitin-like)-UBA (ubiquitin-associated) domain containing protein family. which has a variety of functions. One specific role described for several members of the UbL-UBA family is the involvement in the proteasomal degradation of target proteins. We have reported that CIP75 interacts with the gap junction protein. connexin43 (Cx43). and that CIP75 may modulate the proteasomal degradation of Cx43. Thus. CIP75 may have a critical role in regulating Cx43 levels. and thus intercellular gap junctional communication. This study reports the development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against CIP75 and the characterization of these antibodies through immunoblotting. immunoprecipitation. and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses.

To identify transcriptional signatures associated with progressive loss of fertility. we performed expression profiling of set-2 mutant germlines across generations. We identify a subset of genes whose misexpression is first observed in early generations. a step we refer to as priming; their misexpression then further progresses in late generations. as animals reach sterility.

In this work. the effects of alginate-derived oligosaccharide (AdO) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced neuroinflammation and microglial phagocytosis of Aβ were studied. We found that pretreatment of BV2 microglia with AdO prior to LPS/Aβ stimulation led to a significant inhibition of production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. We further demonstrated that AdO remarkably attenuated the LPS-activated overexpression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB in BV2 cells. In addition to the impressive inhibitory effect on neuroinflammation. we also found that AdO promoted the phagocytosis of Aβ through its interaction with TLR4 in microglia.

In microfield experiments. the increase of soybean yield ranged from 4.5 to 9.4 quintal/ha. barley-from 2.9 to 5.9 quintal/ha. A significant increase in various parameters of structure of the yield was shown in all experimental variants when compared to the control. It was found that an increase in soybean and barley yields and yield components was higher in the variant with a mix of micromycetes when compared to the separate application of each strain. The most efficient mixture was based on the mix of fungal strains (culture filtrate of P. bilaiae Pb14 diluted 1: 5+ liquid cultures of A. pullulans YA05 and Rh. mucilaginosa YR07 in a 1: 5 dilution).,True,nAlp6cQAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,http://ojs.ptbioch.edu.pl/index.php/abp/article/view/1701,,,,http://ojs.ptbioch.edu.pl/index.php/abp/article/download/1701/336,0,0,0

Although more severe inflammation and serious lesions are observed in wild-type mice than Ninj1-deficient mice. there were no changes in the numbers of infiltrating macrophages in the inflamed tissues obtained from WT and Ninj1-deficient mice. Ninj1 expression results in activation of macrophages. and these activated macrophages secrete more cytokines and chemokines than Ninj1-deficient macrophages.

1090013,Allyl Isothiocyanate Protects Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Injury via NRF2 Activation by Decreasing Spontaneous Degradation in Hepatocyte,2020,Min Woo Kim and Ju-Hee Kang and Hyun Jin Jung and Se Yong Park and Thu Han Le Phan and Hee Namgung and Seung-Yong Seo and Yeo Sung Yoon and Seung Hyun Oh,12,Nutrients,11,3585,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the most frequently prescribed analgesic and anti-pyretic drugs. However. APAP-induced hepatotoxicity is a major cause of acute liver failure globally. While the therapeutic dose is safe. an overdose of APAP produces an excess of the toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). subsequently resulting in hepatotoxicity. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC). a bioactive molecule in cruciferous plants. is reported to exert various biological effects. including anti-inflammatory. anti-cancer. and anti-microbial effects. Notably. AITC is known for activating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). but there is limited evidence supporting the beneficial effects on hepatocytes and liver. where AITC is mainly metabolized. We applied a mouse model in the current study to investigate whether AITC protects the liver against APAP-induced injury. wherein we observed the protective effects of AITC. Furthermore. NRF2 nuclear translocation and the increase of target genes by AITC treatment were confirmed by in vitro experiments. APAP-induced cell damage was attenuated by AITC via an NRF2-dependent manner. and rapid NRF2 activation by AITC was attributed to the elevation of NRF2 stability by decreasing its spontaneous degradation. Moreover. liver tissues from our mouse experiment revealed that AITC increases the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). an NRF2 target gene. confirming the potential of AITC as a hepatoprotective agent that induces NRF2 activation. Taken together. our results indicate the potential of AITC as a natural-product-derived NRF2 activator targeting the liver.

There is a paucity of information on the role of vascular endothelium in the membrane-stabilizing effect of Ca 2+ ions. The goal of the present study was to examine the influence of the endothelium on the membrane-stabilizing effect of Ca 2+ ions in rabbit aortic smooth muscle.Methods: Isometric contractions of 2mm ring segments of rabbit aorta. placed in 20ml organ baths containing physiological salt solution (PSS) and bubbled with 95% O 2. 5% CO 2 gas mixture at 37 o C and pH 7.4 were examined. The magnitude of the relaxation responses induced by increasing extracellular Ca 2+ concentration from 5.0 to 25mM in phenylephrine pre-contracted rings was taken as an indirect indicator of the membrane-stabilizing effect of Ca 2+. The relaxation responses induced by 25mM Ca 2+ were estimated in endothelium-intact. endothelium-denuded rings as well as following exposure to 10-6 M methylene blue.Results: In all experiments. an increase in [Ca 2+] o (low bicarbonate PSS) from 5.0 to 25.0 mM in rings with intact endothelium resulted in relaxation responses.

Bone defects (3-mm diameter. 10-mm depth) were created in the femur. Human femoral head prepared according to the Marburg bone bank system was used as a bone allograft. The control group did not receive any filling. The experimental groups were as follows: Group 1–the defects were filled with bone allografts and Group 2–Perforated gentamycin-impregnated bone allografts. The animals were euthanized after 14. 30. and 60 days. Evaluations consisted of histology at 14-. 30-. and 60-days post-surgery.RESULTS: A mature bone formation in the group without a bone allograft occurred after 30 days and the group with an allograft after 14 days. In the groups with an allograft. a bone marrow defect was noted as complete closure after 30 days. Histomorphometric analysis showed that in the group with an antibiotic-impregnated bone. allograft leads to increased resorption of the allograft in the intramedullary space compared to group without antibiotic.CONCLUSION: We believe that a perforated allograft as a result of clinical trials may be obvious and economically affordable in the treatment of bone defects.

High adenosine levels at the tip are believed to be responsible for this tip dominance and the adenosine antagonist. caffeine overrides this dominance promoting multiple tip formation. Caffeine induced multiple tip effect is conserved in all the Dictyostelids tested. Two key components of cAMP relay namely. cAMP phosphodiesterase (Pde4) and adenyl cyclase-A (AcaA) levels get reduced during secondary tip formation in Dictyostelium discoideum. Pharmacological inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase also resulted in multiple tips. Caffeine reduces cAMP levels by 16.4. 2.34. 4.71 and 6.30 folds. respectively in D. discoideum. D. aureostipes. D. minutum and Polysphondylium pallidum. We propose that altered cAMP levels. perturbed cAMP gradient and impaired signalling may be the critical factors for the origin of multiple tips in other Dictyostelids as well. In the presence of caffeine. slug cell movement gets impaired and restricted. The cell type specific markers. ecmA (prestalk) and pspA (prespore) cells are not equally contributing during additional tip formation. During additional tip emergence. prespore cells transdifferentiate to compensate the loss of prestalk cells. Caffeine decreases adenyl cyclase–A (AcaA) levels and as a consequence low cAMP is synthesised altering the gradient. Further if cAMP phosphodiesterase (Pde4) levels go down in the presence of caffeine. the cAMP gradient breaks down. When there is no cAMP gradient. directional movement is inhibited and might favour re-differentiation of prespore to prestalk …,True,oddXOOcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,6,https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-213X-12-26,7922906445279677494,/scholar?cites=7922906445279677494,,https://bmcdevbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-213X-12-26,0,0,0

Here we show that Scar/WAVE’s proline-rich domain is polyphosphorylated after the complex is activated. Blocking Scar/WAVE activation stops phosphorylation in both Dictyostelium and mammalian cells. implying that phosphorylation modulates pseudopods after they have been formed. rather than controlling whether they are initiated. Unexpectedly. phosphorylation is not promoted by chemotactic signaling but is greatly stimulated by cell:substrate adhesion and diminished when cells deadhere. Phosphorylation-deficient or phosphomimetic Scar/WAVE mutants are both normally functional and rescue the phenotype of knockout cells. demonstrating that phosphorylation is dispensable for activation and actin regulation. However. pseudopods and patches of phosphorylation-deficient Scar/WAVE last substantially longer in mutants. altering the dynamics and size of pseudopods and lamellipods and thus changing migration speed. Scar/WAVE phosphorylation does not require ERK2 in Dictyostelium or mammalian cells. However. the MAPKKK homologue SepA contributes substantially—sepA mutants have less steady-state phosphorylation. which does not increase in response to adhesion. The mutants also behave similarly to cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient Scar. with longer-lived pseudopods and patches of Scar recruitment. We conclude that pseudopod engagement with substratum is more important than extracellular signals at regulating Scar/WAVE’s activity and that phosphorylation acts as a pseudopod timer by promoting Scar/WAVE turnover.,True,oddXOOcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,2,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000774,9526665161342394405,/scholar?cites=9526665161342394405,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000774,0,0,0

However. it is unclear how its activity is regulated. beyond a dependence on Rac. Phosphorylation of the proline-rich region. by kinases such as Erk2. has been suggested as an upstream activator. We have recently reported that phosphorylation is not required for complex activation. Rather. it occurs after Scar/WAVE has been activated. and acts as a modulator.

Whereas the exquisite sensitivity of these measurements is well appreciated. a better understanding of the noise sources that limit the resolution of the technique is needed to guide the design of next-generation devices. We measured the current power spectral density (SI) of electrochemical microelectrodes to understand the physical basis of dominant noise sources and to determine how noise varies with the electrode material and geometry. We find that the current noise is thermal in origin in that SI is proportional to the real part of the admittance of the electrode.

In the hair cycle. during follicle regression. the niche traverses the skin through an unknown mechanism to reach the stem cell reservoir and trigger new growth. Here. we identify the dermal sheath that lines the follicle as the key driver of tissue regression and niche relocation through the smooth muscle contractile machinery that generates centripetal constriction force. We reveal that the calcium-calmodulin–myosin light chain kinase pathway controls sheath contraction. When this pathway is blocked. sheath contraction is inhibited. impeding follicle regression and niche relocation.

The system uses a 1310 nm laser light that is guided through single-mode silica optical fibers to the interior of perfusion chambers. which are separated by polycarbonate membranes (470 nm pores) from microchannels. where a culture medium flows in a constant concentration. The system contains four layers. a superior and an inferior layer made of glass. and two intermediate poly (dimethylsiloxane) layers that contain the microchannels and the perfusion chambers. forming a reversible microfluidic device that requires only the sealing of the fibers to the inferior glass cover. The QELS autocorrelation decay rates of the optical signals were correlated to the cells counting in a microscope. and the application of this microsystem to the monitoring of alcoholic fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in the kinetic parameters of K M= 4.1 g/L and μ m= 0.49 h− 1.

The use of a conditioned medium (CM) was suggested as an alternative method for treating various wounds instead of direct hMSC administration. In addition to not having the adverse effects associated with hMSCs. a CM can be easily mass produced and can be stored for long-term. thereby making it useful for clinical applications. In general. a CM is collected from hMSCs with low passage number; whereas. the hMSCs with high passage number are usually discarded because of their low therapeutic efficacy as a result of reduced angiogenic factor secretion. Herein. we used a CM collected from high passage number (passage 12. P12) hMSCs treated with gold-iron nanoparticles (AuFe NPs). Our AuFe NPs were designed to release the iron ion intracellularly via endocytosis. Endosomes with low pH can dissolve iron from AuFe NPs. and thus. the intracellularly released iron ions up-regulate the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Through this mechanism. AuFe NPs improve the amount of VEGF expression from P12 hMSCs so that it is comparable to the amount of VEGF expression from low passage number (passage 6.

However. the conventional clinical devices that can generate ES for promoting wound healing require patient hospitalization due to large-scale of the extracorporeal devices. Herein. we introduce a disposable photovoltaic patch that can be applied to skin wound sites to control cellular microenvironment for promoting wound healing by generating ES. In vitro experiment results show that exogenous ES could enhance cell migration. proliferation. expression of extracellular matrix proteins. and myoblast differentiation of fibroblasts which are critical for wound healing. Our disposable photovoltaic patches were attached to the back of skin wound induced mice. Our patch successfully provided ES. generated by photovoltaic energy harvested from the organic solar cell under visible light illumination. In vivo experiment results show that the patch promoted cutaneous wound healing via enhanced host-inductive cell proliferation. cytokine secretion. and protein synthesis which is critical for wound healing process. Unlike the current treatments for wound healing that engage passive healing processes and often are unsuccessful. our wearable photovoltaic patch can stimulate regenerative activities of endogenous cells and actively contribute to the wound healing processes.

However. the therapeutic efficacy of direct hADSC injection is limited by a low cell viability and poor cell engraftment after administration. To improve the outcomes of this kind of approach. various types of nanoparticles have been utilized to improve the therapeutic efficacy of hADSC transplantation.

In order to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and induce angiogenesis. zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) were synthesized together into a nanoparticle with a pH-sensitive degradation property. Zn and Fe were loaded within the nanoparticles to promote early osteogenic gene expression and to induce angiogenic paracrine factor secretion for hMSCs. In vitro studies revealed that treating an optimized concentration of our zinc-based iron oxide nanoparticles to hMSCs delivered Zn and Fe ion in a controlled release manner and supported osteogenic gene expression (RUNX2 and alkaline phosphatase) with improved vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. Simultaneous intracellular release of Zn and Fe ions through the endocytosis of the nanoparticles further modulated the mild reactive oxygen species generation level in hMSCs without cytotoxicity and thus improved the osteogenic capacity of the stem cells.

Bai,,Histology and Histopathology,,,,Studies and reports focusing on the Bactrian camels’ kidney structure from an anatomical perspective are scanty. therefore. this work aims to systemically investigate the anatomical structure of the kidney and examine the distribution and microstructure of intrarenal arteries. Ten pairs of healthy adult kidneys from male and female Bactrian camels were used in the study. The kidney of Bactrian camel appeared like a broad bean with a smooth surface. Using artery casting. we observed that the renal artery divided into dorsal and ventral branches; the dorsal branch continuously divided into a shorter anterior branch and a longer posterior branch. while the ventral branch directly divided into interlobar arteries. The number of interlobar arteries in the left and right kidneys were slightly different. 14 to 16 in left while 16 in the right kidney. No anastomosis was found between the dorsal and ventral branches or their subbranches. To further study the microscopic structure. microanatomy and scanning microscope were used. Surprisingly. we observed two other ways afferent arteriole arose apart from the interlobular artery. They were the arcuate artery and conjoint afferent arteriole. Two afferent arterioles supplied one glomerulus and occasionally the absence of glomerulus was also observed. where the arteriole kept extending. and no typical glomerulus formed.

The signal. GW170817. was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per 8.0× 10 4 years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 M⊙. in agreement with masses of known neutron stars.

It currently involves more than 2000 physicists from more than 150 institutes and 37 countries. The LHC will provide extraordinary opportunities for particle physics based on its unprecedented collision energy and luminosity when it begins operation in 2007. The principal aim of this report is to present the strategy of CMS to explore the rich physics programme offered by the LHC. This volume demonstrates the physics capability of the CMS experiment. The prime goals of CMS are to explore physics at the TeV scale and to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking-through the discovery of the Higgs particle or otherwise. To carry out this task. CMS must be prepared to search for new particles. such as the Higgs boson or supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles. from the start-up of the LHC since new physics at the TeV scale may manifest itself with modest data samples of the order of a few fb-1 or less. The analysis tools that have been developed are applied to study in great detail and with all the methodology of performing an analysis on CMS data specific benchmark processes upon which to gauge the performance of CMS. These processes cover several Higgs boson decay channels. the production and decay of new particles such as Z′ and supersymmetric particles. B s production and processes in heavy ion collisions. The simulation of these benchmark processes includes subtle effects such as possible detector miscalibration and misalignment.

We previously showed that angiotensin II (Ang II) increases superoxide production by activating an NADH/NADPH oxidase. which contributes to hypertrophy. In this study. we determined whether Ang II stimulation of this oxidase results in H2O2 production by studying the effects of Ang II on intracellular H2O2 generation. intracellular superoxide dismutase and catalase activity. and hypertrophy. Ang II (100 nmol/L) significantly increased intracellular H2O2 levels at 4 hours. Neither superoxide dismutase activity nor catalase activity was affected by Ang II; the SOD present in VSMCs is sufficient to metabolize Ang II–stimulated superoxide to H2O2. which accumulates more rapidly than it is degraded by catalase. This increase in H2O2 was inhibited by extracellular catalase. diphenylene …,True,n2YDw2QAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC,722,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.HYP.32.3.488,14756867151898400223,/scholar?cites=14756867151898400223,,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.HYP.32.3.488,0,0,0

Janzen proposed that reduced seasonal temperature variation selects for narrower thermal tolerances and limited dispersal along tropical elevation gradients [Janzen DH (1967) Am Nat 101:233–249]. These locally adapted traits should. in turn. promote reproductive isolation and higher speciation rates in tropical mountains compared with temperate ones. Here. we show that tropical and temperate montane stream insects have diverged in thermal tolerance and dispersal capacity. two key traits that are drivers of isolation in montane populations. Tropical species in each of three insect clades have markedly narrower thermal tolerances and lower dispersal than temperate species. resulting in significantly greater population divergence. higher cryptic diversity. higher tropical speciation rates. and greater accumulation …,True,n2YDw2QAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC,77,https://www.pnas.org/content/115/49/12471.short,5513672965880359269,/scholar?cites=5513672965880359269,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/49/12471.full.pdf,0,0,0

However. technological innovation is needed if heavier oil supplies are to be exploited further. Toe-to-heel air injection (THAI) and its catalytic add-on processes (CAPRI) combine in-situ combustion with catalytic upgrading using an annular catalyst packed around the horizontal producer well. These techniques offer potentially higher recovery levels and lower environmental impact than alternative technologies (eg. steam-based techniques). An experimental study is reported concerning the optimization of catalyst type and operating conditions for use in the THAI-CAPRI process. The feed oil was supplied from the Whitesands THAI-pilot trial.

1090201,Analyzing the effectiveness of multiple-detect test sets,2003,S Blanton and K Dwarakanath and A Shah,,International Test Conference,,876-885,,Multiple-detect test sets have been shown to be effective in lowering defect level. Other researchers have noted that observing the effects of a defect can be controlled by sensitizing affected sites to circuit outputs but defect excitation is inherently probabilistic given a defect’s inherent. unknown nature. As a result. test sets that sensitize every signal line multiple times with varying circuit state has a greater probability of detecting a defect. In past work. the entire circuit is considered when varying circuit state from one vector to another for a given signal line. However. it may be possible to improve defect excitation by exploiting the localized nature of many defect types. Specifically. by varying circuit state in the physical region or neighborhood surrounding a line affected by a defect. the defect excitation and therefore detection can be improved. In this paper. we present a method for extracting a physical region surrounding a signal line but more importantly. techniques for analyzing the excitation characteristics of the region. Analysis of в-detect test sets reveals that гед% to ж д% of signal line regions do not achieve at least four unique states. indicating opportunity to further reduce defect level.,True,n2YDw2QAAAAJ:BJrgspguQaEC,63,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.112.4318&rep=rep1&type=pdf,105467784286730686,/scholar?cites=105467784286730686,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.112.4318&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The data were obtained from 1994 to 2007 at a coastal site in Hong Kong. which is strongly influenced by the outflow of Asian continental air during the winter and the inflow of maritime air from the subtropics in the summer. Three methods are used to derive the rate of change in ozone. A linear fit to the 14-year record shows that the ozone concentration increased by 0.58 ppbv/yr. whereas comparing means in years 1994–2000 and 2001–2007 gives an increase of 0.87 ppbv/yr for a 7-year period. The ozone changes in air masses from various source regions are also examined. Using local wind and carbon monoxide (CO) data to filter out local influence. we find that ozone increased by 0.94 ppbv/yr from 1994–2000 to 2001–2007 in air masses from Eastern China. with similar changes in the other two continent-influenced air-mass groups. but no statistically significant change in the marine air. An examination of the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column obtained from GOME and SCIAMACHY reveals an increase in atmospheric NO2 in China's three fastest developing coastal regions. whereas NO2 in other parts of Asia decreased during the same period. and no obvious trend over the main shipping routes in the South China Sea was indicated. Thus the observed increase in background ozone in Hong Kong is most likely due to the increased emissions of NO2 (and possibly volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as well) in the …,True,NG9JKWMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,349,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/9/6217/2009/,5822746645689668334,/scholar?cites=5822746645689668334,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/9/6217/2009/acp-9-6217-2009.pdf,0,0,0

We show that black carbon (BC) aerosols play the key role in modifying the PBL meteorology and hence enhancing the haze pollution. With model simulations and data analysis from various field observations in December 2013. we demonstrate that BC induces heating in the PBL. particularly in the upper PBL. and the resulting decreased surface heat flux substantially depresses the development of PBL and consequently enhances the occurrences of extreme haze pollution episodes. We define this process as the “dome effect” of BC and suggest an urgent need for reducing BC emissions as an efficient way to mitigate the extreme haze pollution in megacities of China.,True,NG9JKWMAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC,328,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016GL067745,2687948609930588529,/scholar?cites=2687948609930588529,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL067745,0,0,0

The official air pollution index near the Olympic Stadium and the data from our nearby site revealed an obvious association between air quality and meteorology and different responses of secondary and primary pollutants to the control measures. Ambient concentrations of vehicle-related nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at an urban site dropped by 25% and 20–45% in the first two weeks after full control was put in place. but the levels of ozone. sulfate and nitrate in PM2.5 increased by 16%. 64%. 37%. respectively. compared to the period prior to the full control; wind data and back trajectories indicated the contribution of regional pollution from the North China Plain. Air quality (for both primary and secondary pollutants) improved significantly during the Games. which were also associated with the changes in weather conditions (prolonged rainfall. decreased temperature. and more frequent air masses from clean regions). A comparison of the ozone data at three sites on eight ozone-pollution days. when the air masses were from the southeast-south-southwest sector. showed that regional pollution sources contributed >34–88% to the peak ozone concentrations at the urban site in Beijing. Regional sources also contributed significantly to the CO concentrations in urban Beijing. Ozone production efficiencies at two sites were low (~3 ppbv/ppbv). indicating that ozone formation was being controlled by VOCs.

Ozone and PM2.5 showed strong seasonal cycles but with contrast patterns: O3 reached a maximum in warm seasons but PM2.5 in cold seasons. Correlation analysis suggests a VOC-sensitive regime for O3 chemistry and a formation of secondary aerosols under conditions of high O3 in summer. Compared with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards in China. our measurements report 15 days of O3 exceedance and 148 days of PM2.5 exceedance during the 1 yr period. suggesting a severe air pollution situation in this region. Case studies for typical O3 and PM2.5 episodes demonstrated that these episodes were generally associated with an air mass transport pathway over the mid-YRD. i.e.. along the Nanjing–Shanghai axis with its city clusters. and showed that synoptic weather played an important role in air pollution. especially for O3. Agricultural burning activities caused high PM2.5 and O3 pollution during harvest seasons. especially in June. A calculation of potential source contributions based on Lagrangian dispersion simulations suggests that emissions from the YRD contributed to over 70% of the O3 precursor CO. with a majority from the mid-YRD.

Analysis of plume characteristics and air‐mass back trajectories show the highest concentrations of O3 (and other trace gases) were mainly due to emissions from the Beijing urban area.

The latter are referred to as aerosols. which are multifaceted agents affecting air quality. weather and climate through many mechanisms. Unlike gas pollutants. aerosols interact strongly with meteorological variables with the strongest interactions taking place in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The PBL hosting the bulk of aerosols in the lower atmosphere is affected by aerosol radiative effects. Both aerosol scattering and absorption reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground and thus reduce the sensible heat fluxes that drive the diurnal evolution of the PBL. Moreover. aerosols can increase atmospheric stability by inducing a temperature inversion as a result of both scattering and absorption of solar radiation. which suppresses dispersion of pollutants and leads to further increases in aerosol concentration …,True,NG9JKWMAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C,243,https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article-abstract/4/6/810/4191281,14988341726431114222,/scholar?cites=14988341726431114222,,https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/4/6/810/4191281,0,0,0

A pooled method was adopted in the data analysis to reduce the influence of irregular sampling frequency. The tropospheric O3 over Beijing shows a seasonal and vertical distribution typical of mid-latitude locations in the Northern Hemisphere. but has higher daytime concentrations in the lower troposphere. when compared to New York City. Tokyo. and Paris at similar latitude. The tropospheric O3 over Beijing exhibits a common summer maximum and a winter minimum. with a broad summer maximum in the middle troposphere and a narrower early summer (June) peak in the lower troposphere. Examination of meteorological and satellite data suggests that the lower tropospheric O3 maximum in June is a result of strong photochemical production. transport of regional pollution. and possibly also more intense burnings of biomass in Central-Eastern China. Trajectory analysis indicates that in summer the regional pollution from the NCPs. maybe mixed with urban plumes from Beijing. played important roles on the high O3 concentrations in the boundary layer. but had limited impact on the O3 concentrations in the middle troposphere.

The same measurement techniques and observation-based model were used to minimize uncertainties in comparison of the results due to difference in methodologies. All four cities suffered from serious O3 pollution but showed different precursor distributions. The model-calculated in situ O3 production rates were compared with the observed change rates to infer the relative contributions of on-site photochemistry and transport. At the rural site downwind of Beijing. export of the well-processed urban plumes contributed to the extremely high O3 levels (up to an hourly value of 286 ppbv). while the O3 pollution observed at suburban sites of Shanghai.

Combined with high-resolution back trajectories. dCO/dNOy (the ratio of enhancement of CO concentration above background to that of NOy) is used to define whether O3 is locally or regionally produced. Five out of the ten Hong Kong O3-episodes studied show a ""pollution signature"" that is indicative of impact from Guangdong Province. Examination of speciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) shows that the reactivity of VOCs is dominated by anthropogenic VOCs. of which the reactive aromatics dominate. in particular xylenes and toluene. Calculations using a photochemical box model indicate that between 50–100% of the O3 increase observed in Hong Kong during the O3 episodes can be explained by photochemical generation within the Hong Kong area. provided that nitrous acid (HONO) is present at the concentrations derived from this study. An Observation-Based Model (OBM) is used to calculate the sensitivity of the O3 production to changes in the concentrations of the precursor compounds.

The average mixing ratio was 58 (±16) ppbv for O 3 and 393 (±223) ppbv for CO during the study period. The monthly variations in O 3 and CO exhibited a similar pattern. ie high in summer and low in autumn. While such a seasonal pattern for O 3 is a common phenomenon in many rural areas in the Northern Hemisphere and is mainly due to seasonal changes in solar radiation and temperature. the higher CO levels in summer were attributed to the difference in dynamic transport and the evolution of PBL heights in summer and autumn over this region.

In contrast to North America and Europe. long-term measurements of surface O3 are very limited in China. We compile available O3 observations at Mt. Tai – the highest mountain over the North China Plain – during 2003–2015 and analyze the decadal change of O3 and its sources. A linear regression analysis shows that summertime O3 measured at Mt. Tai has increased significantly by 1.7 ppbv yr−1 for June and 2.1 ppbv yr−1 for the July–August average. The observed increase is supported by a global chemistry-climate model hindcast (GFDL-AM3) with O3 precursor emissions varying from year to year over 1980–2014. Analysis of satellite data indicates that the O3 increase was mainly due to the increased emissions of O3 precursors. in particular volatile organic compounds (VOCs). An important finding is that the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) have diminished since 2011. but the increase of VOCs appears to have enhanced the ozone production efficiency and contributed to the observed O3 increase in central eastern China.

Ambient air pollutants measured included O3. NOx. CO. SO2. NMHCs. and carbonyls. The purpose is to improve our understanding of the interplay among local and regional air pollutants in the Hong Kong area. and the influence of regional transport on local air pollutants. The results indicate that the mean levels of air pollutants at the WQS site were much higher than those at the TC site. except NOx. Thirteen O3 episode days (daily O3 peak in excess of 122 ppbv) were monitored at WQS during the study period. while only 2 days were recorded at TC. Diurnal variations of O3 showed higher nighttime levels of O3 at TC than at WQS as well as more photochemical activity at WQS than TC. Remarkable differences in diurnal variations were also found between high and low O3 pollution days at each site. implying that Hong Kong is more acutely VOC-limited than the inland PRD region. Ratio analyses for trace gases and VOCs and back trajectory calculation revealed that the air masses arriving at WQS were more aged due to regional influence. whereas the air masses at TC were mainly affected by local emissions and/or regional transport.

Thermo-gravimetric analysis confirmed that during the thermolysis of red pepper stalk. the magnitude of exothermic reaction in CO2 from 220 to 400 °C was substantially different from that in N2. resulting in the different extents of carbonization. The physico-chemical properties of biochar produced in CO2 were varied compared to biochar produced in N2. For example. the surface area of biochar produced in CO2 was increased from 32.46 to 109.15 m2 g−1.

There is a pressing need to create healthy places and to reduce the health threats inherent in places already built. However. there has been little awareness of the adverse effects of what we have constructed-or the positive benefits of well designed built environments. This book provides a far-reaching follow-up to the pathbreaking Urban Sprawl and Public Health. published in 2004. That book sparked a range of inquiries into the connections between constructed environments. particularly cities and suburbs. and the health of residents. especially humans. Since then. numerous studies have extended and refined the book's research and reporting. Making Healthy Places offers a fresh and comprehensive look at this vital subject today. There is no other book with the depth. breadth. vision. and accessibility that this book offers. In addition to being of particular interest to undergraduate and graduate students in public health and urban planning. it will be essential reading for public health officials. planners. architects. landscape architects. environmentalists. and all those who care about the design of their communities.

The two main components of childhood obesity are physical inactivity and improper nutrition. and it is becoming increasingly evident that the built environment can determine the level of exposure to these risk factors. Through a multidisciplinary literature review. we investigated the association between various built environment attributes and childhood obesity. We found that neighborhood features such as walkability/bikeability. mixed land use. accessible destinations. and transit increase resident physical activity; also that access to high‐caloric foods and convenience stores increases risk of overweight and obesity. whereas the presence of neighborhood supermarkets and farmers' markets is associated with lower childhood body mass index and overweight status.

Beyond the classical Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) and double diffusive (DD) instabilities that can affect such two-layer stratifications right at the initial time of contact. diffusive-layer convection (DLC) as well as delayed-double diffusive (DDD) instabilities can set in at a later time when differential diffusion effects act upon the evolving density profile starting from an initial step-function profile between the two miscible solutions. The conditions for these instabilities to occur can therefore be obtained only by considering time evolving base-state profiles. To do so. we perform a linear stability analysis based on a quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) as well as nonlinear simulations of a diffusion–convection model to classify and analyse all possible buoyancy-driven instabilities of a stratification of a solution of a given solute A on top of another miscible solution of a species B. Our theoretical model couples Darcy’s law to evolution equations for the concentration of species A and B ruling the density of the miscible solutions. The parameters of the problem are a buoyancy ratio R quantifying the ratio of the relative contribution of B and A to the density as well as δ. the ratio of diffusion coefficients of these two species.

Depending on the relative effect of A. B and C on the viscosity. different viscous fingering (VF) instabilities can be observed. In this context. a linear stability analysis of this reaction–diffusion–convection problem under the quasi-steady-state approximation is performed to classify the various possible instability scenarios. To do so. we determine the criteria for an instability. obtain dispersion curves both at initial contact time using an analytical implicit solution and at later times via numerical stability analysis. Along with recovering known results for non-reactive systems where the displacement of a more viscous fluid by a less viscous one leads to a VF instability. it is found that in the presence of a chemical reaction. injecting a more viscous fluid into a less viscous fluid can also lead to instabilities. This occurs when the chemical reaction leads to the build up of non-monotonic viscosity profiles. Various instability scenarios are classified in a parameter plane spanned by Rb and Rc representing the log-mobility ratios of the viscosities of the B and C solution respectively with respect to that of the injected solution of A.

The adsorption experiments were carried out at pH 3.0 and 5.0. The effect of malonic and boric acid presence on the adsorption of lead ions was also studied. Palm shell activated carbon showed high adsorption capacity for lead ions. especially at pH 5 with an ultimate uptake of 95.2 mg/g. This high uptake showed palm shell activated carbon as amongst the best adsorbents for lead ions. Boric acid presence did not affect significantly lead uptake. whereas malonic acid decreased it.

The data obtained were used to validate the method proposed by Spencer and Danner using a modified Rackett equation. The experimental and estimated density values using the modified Rackett equation gave almost identical values with average absolute percent deviations less than 0.03% for the jatropha oil and 0.04% for the jatropha methyl esters. The Janarthanan empirical equation was also employed to predict jatropha biodiesel densities. This equation performed equally well with average absolute percent deviations within 0.05%.

This effluent that is extremely rich in organic content needs to be properly treated to minimize environmental hazards before it is released into watercourses. The common practice for treating POME in Malaysia involves a combination of aerobic and anaerobic methods. The purpose of tertiary treatment is to allow the treated water to be reused in the mill operations for other purposes such as feed water. The proposed treatment will also ensure the industry to meet a more stringent discharge standard in terms of the BOD. COD and nitrogen values. In this study membrane ultrafiltration is used as the tertiary treatment method. Before the actual membrane operation was conducted. the samples were pre-treated using three separate method namely filtration. centrifugation and coagulation.

Two factors are required in the economically feasible process to make chlorophyll production: material with high pigment content and efficient extraction mechanism. In this work. extraction of chlorophyll from harvested black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) leaves. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) needles. field sow thistle (Sonchus arvensis) leaves. and green microalga (Chlorella sp.) was discussed. The highest pigment content was detected in Chlorella cells (4.46%) followed by black locust leaves (1.63%). sow thistle leaves (1.48%) and pine needles (0.38%). The chlorophyll extraction rate was the highest for black locust leaves (k= 3.59 h-1). sow thistle leaves (k= 2.90 h-1) and Chlorella cells (k= 2.80 h-1) with the use of methanol as a solvent.

However these catalysts have several drawbacks. such as corrosion and toxicity problems. costly and inefficient procedures for separating them from the products. and the need to neutralize the waste streams.[1] These problems could be solved by developing heterogeneous solid-acid catalysts. which could then be more easily and efficiently separated from the products. enabling their reuse.

Many models of coke quality prediction have been proposed. most of which are based on coal characteristics and limited to the same coal geographic origin. but as yet there is no universally applicable prediction formula. The present work describes a simple model of coke CRI/CSR prediction based on the assumption that the CSR of a coke produced from a blend of coals can be predicted from the CSR obtained from the cokes of the individual coals through the application of the additivity law. The additivity law was also applied to the coke cold mechanical strength indices derived from the Irsid test. which are widely employed by the European coke industry as …,True,SDzH2vwAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,59,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236106004728,14288869654719605719,/scholar?cites=14288869654719605719,,,0,0,0

1090506,Atom‐Molecule Reaction  Studied by Molecular Beams,1972,J Geddes and HF Krause and WL Fite,56,The Journal of Chemical Physics,7,3298-3307,American Institute of Physics,Collisions between deuterium atoms and hydrogen molecules have been studied in a modulated crossed beam experiment. The relative signal intensity and the signal phase for product HD from reactive collisions allowed determination of both the angular distribution and HD mean velocity as a function of angle. From these a relative differential reactive scattering cross section in center‐of‐mass coordinates was deduced. The experiment indicates that reactively formed HD having little or no internal excitation. departs from the collision anistropically. with maximum amplitude 180° from the direction of the incident D beam in c.m. coordinates. which shows that the D–H–H reacting configuration is short‐lived compared to its rotation time.

Because of the variability of groups attached on POSS. they exhibit different performance in polymer nanocomposites: metal‐containing POSS show good catalytic charring ability; vinyl‐containing and phenyl‐containing POSS promote the strength of char. Improvements in the cone calorimeter (such as reduced peak heat release rate) are advantages of POSS as preceramics for fire retardancy compared with traditional flame retardants. and it will pave the way to the design of inorganic–organic hybrid polymer nanocomposites with enhanced flame retardancy and thermal stability.

The DSC results show that the Al nanoparticles can either facilitate or hinder the crystallization of LDPE. depending on the dispersion of the nanoparticles in LDPE. The well‐dispersed Al nanoparticles do not have nucleating effects and mainly act as obstacles in the crystallization process. but the agglomerates of Al nanoparticles can act as nucleating agents and slightly accelerate the crystallization process of LDPE. The Al microparticles have nucleating effect and facilitate the crystallization process of LDPE. The combined Avrami–Ozawa equation was used to describe the nonisothermal crystallization process.

A case history: Polylactide-clays,2013,Ping Wei and Sergio Bocchini and Giovanni Camino,49,European polymer journal,4,932-939,Pergamon,This paper addresses the combustion behaviour of polylactide (PLA) nanocomposites based on organomodified montmorillonite clays. It is shown that PLA nanocomposites burn in a very different way compared to virgin PLA. Indeed. nanocomposites burning rate is usually lower respect to PLA. with a rate decrease depending on clay type and concentration. However. an easier ignition is shown by PLA nanocomposites as compared to PLA which is due to a catalytic effect of the clays. It is shown that these peculiar features of nanocomposites burning behaviour may prevent reliable comparison between polymers and nanocomposites based only on a single parameter such as UL 94 test ranking or the Limiting Oxygen Index value (LOI).

This study was performed to isolate and characterize Cr-resistant bacteria from the rhizosphere and endosphere of P. juliflora growing on the tannery effluent contaminated soil. A total of 5 and 21 bacterial strains were isolated from the rhizosphere and endosphere. respectively. could tolerate Cr up to 3000 mg l-1. These isolates also exhibited tolerance to other toxic heavy metals such as. Cd. Cu. Pb and Zn. and high concentration (174 g l-1) of NaCl.

During the same period Cu remained unchanged. The metal content reductions can be related to the separate collection of paper‐cardboard. glass. and package waste from MSW. though materials separately collected were limited to 6.7% of raw MSW production. Extending the source collection of recyclables to separate metallic components and performing slight …,True,zf00MN8AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,8,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/clen.201300821,511153389264682483,/scholar?cites=511153389264682483,,,0,0,0

Ltd,The ability of snails to accumulate trace elements is well known. We analysed the snail Theba pisana as an indicator of soil contamination by trace elements after a mine spill accident. to assess the exposure of animal and human consumption. Snails were collected in autumn and spring. when they are most active.In general. trace elements in the soft tissues reached greater concentrations in the contaminated soils than in the non‐contaminated soils. although significant differences were only found for As. Cd. Cu Fe and Hg. Cadmium content in tissues. with a maximum value of 10 mg kg−1 (dry matter). was the most worrying result. Trace element concentrations in the snail bodies were still of concern for human consumption; As and Cd concentrations were sometimes higher than the maximum concentration authorised in foodstuffs. Generally. nutritional status of the contaminated snails was …,True,zf00MN8AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,8,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.6035,4408130607383867403,/scholar?cites=4408130607383867403,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/79904/4/The%20snail%20Theba%20pisana%20as%20indicator%20of%20soil%20contamination.pdf,0,0,0
1090626,Heavy metal pollution in soils and urban-grown organic vegetables in the province of Sevilla. Spain,2019,Rafael López and Juana Hallat and Asunción Castro and Adolfo Miras and Pilar Burgos,35,Biological Agriculture & Horticulture,4,219-237,Taylor & Francis,Sources of heavy metal pollution in vegetables can be varied. The focus of this study was to determine the factors affecting trace metal pollution in soils and vegetables that are grown on community urban and periurban organic farms in Spain. The results showed that soil and dust deposition affected plant composition more than other anthropogenic sources. such as traffic loads. Lettuce and broad bean samples collected from one urban farm showed high concentrations of crustal metals Fe. Ca. Mn and Cr. which was thought be due to Saharan dust deposition. The build-up of soil Cu concentration. due to the use of Cu-based fungicide over a long term. was observed on the farm where vegetables had been grown over a long period of time. On the same farm. concentrations of Pb in the soil and the vegetables were noted to be at levels that could pose a risk to human health and/or the environment and this was …,True,zf00MN8AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,6,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01448765.2019.1590234,8413812750031773161,/scholar?cites=8413812750031773161,,,0,0,0
1090627,Accumulation. transfer and remediation of Cd in soils affected by the Aznalcóllar mine spill (SW Spain): a decade of experience (1998-2008),2009,Alfredo Pérez de Mora and Engracia Madejón and Pilar Burgos and Paula Madejón and María Teresa Domínguez and Fernando Madrid Díaz and Teodoro Marañón and José Manuel Murillo Carpio and Francisco Cabrera,,,,,Nova Science Publishers,Cadmium is a non-essential trace element with great potential to escape the soil-plant barrier. resulting in readily transmission through the food chain and high-risk for potential consumers. Although Cd was not a major component of the Aznalcóllar mine toxic spill (SW Spain. 1998) short- and mid-term studies have shown that residual Cd contamination in soil is a major problem for a safe and sustainable reutilization of the affected area (4500ha). We summarize a decade of experience dealing with soils contaminated with Cd in a dynamic and changing landscape “the Guadiamar Valley”. a formerly agricultural area redesigned as a nature reserve “Green Corridor” after the accident. The accumulation. availability and remediation of Cd in soil and its implications for the soil-plant-animal system are discussed within the context of a recent environmental disaster.,True,zf00MN8AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,4,https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/28763,15331800537085158458,/scholar?cites=15331800537085158458,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/28763/3/Accumulation.pdf,0,0,0
