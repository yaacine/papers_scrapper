This material has numerous applications in mechanical. electrical. tribological. biomedical. and optical fields. Severe friction and wear in some machine parts consumes high amount of energy. which makes the process energy inefficient. Thus. DLC coating can be an effective means to lower the friction and wear rate. Some important process variables that affect the tribological characteristics of DLC coating are adhesion promoter intermediate layer. substrate surface roughness. hydrogen incorporation or hydrogen non involvement. and coating deposition parameters (e.g.. bias voltage. etching. current. precursor gas. time. and substrate temperature).

Jatropha. and cottonseed sources. animal fats. and waste cooking oil. Biodiesel is considered as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. However. biodiesel has poor cold flow behavior (i.e.. high cloud point & pour point) and oxidation stability compared with petroleum diesel because of the presence of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid esters. Consequently. the performance of biodiesel during cold weather is affected. When biodiesel is oxidized. the subsequent dregs can adversely affect the performance of the fuel system as well as clog the fuel filter. fuel lines. and injector.

It is the third most important fuel source used to generate electricity and for thermal applications. as 50% of the global population depends on biomass. The increase in availability and technological developments of recent years allow the use of biomass as a renewable energy source with low levels of emissions and environmental impacts. Biomass energy can be in the forms of biogas. bio-liquid. and bio-solid fuels. It can be used to replace fossil fuels in the power and transportation sectors. This paper critically reviews the facts and prospects of biomass. the pyrolysis process to obtain bio-oil. the impact of different pyrolysis technology (for example. temperature and speed of pyrolysis process). and the impact of various reactors. The paper also discusses different pyrolysis products. their yields. and factors affecting biomass products. including the present status of the pyrolysis process and future challenges. This study concluded that the characteristics of pyrolysis products depend on the biomass used. and what the pyrolysis product. such as bio-oil. can contribute to the local economy. Finally. more research. along with government subsidies and technology transfer. is needed to tackle the future challenges of the development of pyrolysis technology.

Energy balance analysis allows the designer to appraise the internal energy variations of a thermodynamic system as a function of ‘‘energy flows’’ across the control volume as work or heat and also the enthalpies associated with the energy flows which are passing through these boundaries. Palm and coconut are the two most potential biodiesel feed stocks in this part of the world. The investigation was conducted in a four-cylinder diesel engine fuelled with 10% and 20% blends of palm and coconut biodiesels and compared with B5 at full load condition and in the speed range of 1000 to 4000 RPM. Among the all tested blends. palm blends seemed more promising in terms of engine performance. emission. and heat losses.

Taylor & Francis Group. London. ISBN 978-1-138-02993-4,In this work. an analytical model was developed to investigate the dependence of crack breathing behavior on the crack location under the effect of unbalance force. A parameter known as the effectual bending angle is introduced to describe the non-linear relationship between crack direction and bending direction for balanced and unbalanced shaft along the shaft length. Breathing behavior of crack was visualized by examining the duration of each crack status (open. closed and partially open/closed) during a full shaft rotation. It is shown that a crack in an unbalanced shaft has more breathing patterns than a crack in a balanced shaft. including single status (fully open/never-closed or fully closed/neveropen) and dual statuses. Two pairs of interesting locations along the shaft length were identified. where the crack shows specific breathing behaviours. Further. the angular range during which a crack remains fully closed. partially open/closed or fully open. changes significantly with the crack location. The analytical model developed in this work can be further utilised to obtain the time-varying stiffness matrix of the cracked shaft element under the influence of unbalance force.1 INTRODUCTION disallows accurate modelling of crack breathing behaviour under unbalance force.

Engineering and Technology. scholar.waset.org/1999.8/10006376,In this study. an analytical model is developed to study crack breathing behavior under the effect of crack location and unbalance force. Crack breathing behavior is determined using effectual bending angle by studying the transient change in closed area of the crack. The status of the crack of a balanced shaft is symmetrical about shaft rotational angle and the duration of each crack status remains unchanged. The global stiffness of the balanced shaft is independent of crack location. Different crack breathing behavior for the unbalanced shaft has been observed. The influence of crack location on the unbalanced shaft stiffness can be divided into three regions. When the crack is located between 0.3 L and 0.8335 L. where L is the total length of the shaft. the unbalanced shaft is less stiff and when located outside this region it is stiffer than the balanced shaft. It was also found that unbalanced shaft stiffness has a maximum value with a crack at 0.1946 L. a minimum value at 0.8053 L and same value as balanced shaft at 0.3 L and 0.8335 L.,True,vK51WykAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,1,https://researchdirect.westernsydney.edu.au/islandora/object/uws:41728/datastream/PDF/download/citation.pdf,8412315165609199907,/scholar?cites=8412315165609199907,,https://researchdirect.westernsydney.edu.au/islandora/object/uws:41728/datastream/PDF/download/citation.pdf,0,0,0

Functionality that cannot be introduced into MOFs directly via de novo syntheses can be accessed through post-synthesis modification (PSM) on the reactive moieties of the linkers and/or nodes without disrupting the metal–linker bonds. Even more intriguing methods that go beyond PSM are herein termed building block replacement (BBR) which encompasses (i) solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE). (ii) non-bridging ligand replacement. and (iii) transmetalation.

The TST process consists of the following steps: firstly preparing oxalate modified NSM (Ox-NSM) at pH 9 and secondly substituting AA for Ox to form AA-NSM at pH 5. Both the Ox- and AA-NSM particles were clearly confirmed by the FT-IR spectra and TGA curves. The content of each AA in the AA-NSM appeared different because of the difference in both the structure and isoelectric point of each AA molecule. It is noteworthy that Ox. as a template in the intermediate Ox-NSM. plays a key role in the formation of AA-NSM with free NH2 group inside.

The main challenge in SA research is the ability to “program” the properties of the individual pieces such that they organize into a desired structure. Although a general strategy for doing so is still elusive. heuristic rules can be formulated that guide design of SA under various conditions and thermodynamic constraints. This Review examines SA in both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium/dynamic systems and discusses different SA modalities: energy driven. entropy-driven. templated. and field-directed.

With no gas present. the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing pore size. In the presence of adsorbed gas. MOFs with smaller pores experience reduced thermal conductivity due to phonon scattering introduced by gas–crystal interactions. In contrast. for larger pores (>1.7 nm). the adsorbed gas does not significantly affect thermal conductivity. This difference is due to the decreased probability of gas–crystal collisions in larger pore structures. In contrast to MOFs with simple cubic pores. the thermal conductivity in structures with triangular and hexagonal pore channels exhibits significant anisotropy.

Our study reveals that the thermal conductance of the system (crystal and gas) is dominated by lattice thermal conductivity in the crystal. and that conductance is reduced as the concentration of gas in the pores increases. This mechanism was observed from classical molecular simulations of a monatomic gas in an idealized porous crystal structure. We show that the decreased conductivity associated with increased gas concentration is due to phonon scattering in the crystal due to interactions with gas molecules. Calculations of scattering rates for two phonon modes reveal that scattering of the lowest frequency mode scales linearly with gas density.

In molecular simulations. the heat of adsorption in zeolites is often computed using either of the following methods: (1) using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. which requires the partial derivative of the pressure with respect to temperature at constant loading.

As support oxides. we have employed thin. well-ordered alumina and silica films grown on top of NiAl(110) and Mo(112) surfaces. According to our analysis. the vanadia particles exhibit very similar morphology on both supports but differ in the extent of particle–support interactions. It is shown that these differences in the vanadia–support interface region strongly affect the CO adsorption behavior of the particles. The measured vibrational spectra of the model systems are interpreted on the basis of DFT calculations for model compounds and surface models for both the vanadia/silica and the vanadia/alumina system.

Compared with RS. RR can provide much higher sensitivity and selectivity in detecting catalytically-significant surface metal oxides. RR can potentially give useful information on the nature of excited states relevant to photocatalysis and on the anharmonic potential of the ground state. In this critical review a detailed discussion is presented on several types of RR experimental systems. three distinct sources of so-called Raman (fluorescence) background. detection limits for RR compared to other techniques (EXAFS.

In situ infrared spectroscopy was used to study the interaction of CO2 with amine-grafted SBA-15. We employed three different types of amine-grafted SBA-15 surfaces to quantify the effect distinct tethered amine moieties have on the chemistry of CO2 interacting with amine-grafted SBA-15. When the SBA-15 surface has a low density of amines and is “capped” to mitigate against interactions with surface-bound moieties. no new chemical species are observed on exposure to carbon dioxide. An ionic carbamate and a surface-bound carbamate are observed on the other SBA-15 surfaces on exposure to CO2.

Here we report the synthesis of a porous monolithic metal–organic framework (MOF). which after successful packing and densification reaches 259 cm 3 (STP) cm− 3 capacity. This is the highest value reported to date for conformed shape porous solids. and represents a greater than 50% improvement over any previously reported experimental value. Nanoindentation tests on the monolithic MOF showed robust mechanical properties. with hardness at least 130% greater than that previously measured in its conventional MOF counterparts. Our findings represent a substantial step in the application of mechanically robust conformed and densified MOFs for high volumetric energy storage and other industrial applications.,True,abvALPoAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,206,https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat5050,17597037300494297900,/scholar?cites=17597037300494297900,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/274866/Main%20Manuscript%20-%20Tian%20Tian%20-%20Nature%20Materials%20R8.pdf?sequence=3,0,0,0

Here. we show that a water-stable metal-organic framework. NU-1000. with hierarchical pore structure has the right combination of properties to be particularly well-suited as a scaffold for immobilizing enzymes such that they maintain full enzymatic catalytic activity. The immobilized enzyme shows greater resistance to organic solvent and denaturant than does the free enzyme and is characterized by greater reactant accessibility and higher activity than the same enzyme encapsulated in topologically simpler metal-organic frameworks.

The Brunauer. Emmett. and Teller (BET)-estimated nitrogen monolayer loading is thus converted to a “BET area.” but the meaning of MOF BET areas remains under debate. Recent emphasis has been placed on the usage of four so-called “BET consistency criteria.” Using these criteria and simulated nitrogen isotherms for perfect crystals. we calculated BET areas for graphene and 25 MOFs having different pore-size distributions. BET areas were compared with their corresponding geometrically calculated. nitrogen-accessible surface areas (NASAs). Analysis of simulation snapshots elucidated the contributions of “pore-filling” and “monolayer-formation” to the nitrogen adsorption loadings in different MOF pores. revealing the origin of …,True,abvALPoAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,132,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5b10266,1528458307597889745,/scholar?cites=1528458307597889745,,http://pstorage-acs-6854636.s3.amazonaws.com/3722200/ja5b10266_si_001.pdf,0,0,0

In oxide frameworks. variable stoichiometry can lead to more complex defect structures. e.g.. crystallographic shear planes or modules with differing compositions. which can be the source of further chemical reactivity; likewise. the layered hcp UiO-67 can react further to reversibly form a two-dimensional metal–organic framework. hxl UiO-67.
