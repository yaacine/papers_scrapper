1209355,Design of an Ultrahigh Birefringence Photonic Crystal Fiber with Large Nonlinearity Using All Circular Air Holes for a Fiber-Optic Transmission System,2018,S.K. Biswas and S.M.R. Islam and M.R. Islam and M.M.A. Mia and S. Sayem and F Ahmed,5,Photonics,,,MDPI,This paper proposes a hexagonal photonic crystal fiber (H-PCF) structure with all circular air holes in order to simultaneously achieve ultrahigh birefringence and high nonlinearity. The H-PCF design consists of an asymmetric core region. where one air hole is a reduced diameter and the air hole in its opposite vertex is omitted. The light-guiding properties of the proposed H-PCF structure were studied using the full-vector finite element method (FEM) with a circular perfectly matched layer (PML). The simulation results showed that the proposed H-PCF exhibits an ultrahigh birefringence of 3.87× 10− 2. a negative dispersion coefficient of− 753.2 ps/(nm km). and a nonlinear coefficient of 96.51 W− 1 km− 1 at an excitation wavelength of 1550 nm. The major advantage of our H-PCF design is that it provides these desirable modal properties without using any non-circular air holes in the core and cladding region. thus making the fiber fabrication process much easier. The ultrahigh birefringence. large negative dispersion. and high nonlinearity of our designed H-PCF make it a very suitable candidate for optical backpropagation applications. which is a scheme for the simultaneous dispersion and nonlinearity compensation of optical-fiber transmission links.

They are suitable for a broad range of applications and scientific research including cavity quantum electrodynamics (c-QED). sensing. parametric oscillation. frequency comb and so forth. The major nonlinear effect in silica is the Kerr nonlinearity that arises from the dependence of refractive index on the signal intensity. In this thesis. we focus on the theoretical analysis of Kerr and Raman nonlinear effects in a silica spherical microcavity. We derive several analytical models for various nonlinear effects. including self phase modulation (SPM). cross phase modulation (XPM) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS).  The first part of this thesis develops a theoretical framework to describe the impact of Kerr nonlinearity. especially SPM on WGM. First a mathematical formulation to express  in spherical co-ordinates is developed. We define the effective mode volume  for the the first time to analyze SPM effects by taking   tensor in spherical co-ordinates and it is found that the effective mode volume is always smaller than the physical volume of the microsphere. Simulation results show that whispering gallery mode undergoes a negative frequency shift proportional to the injected energy due to SPM.

The first one. related to the ZnO/MgO interface formation. is evidenced by strong enhancements of the zero-phonon and first phonon replica of the excitonic emission. which are accompanied by a total suppression of its second phonon replica. This effect can be explained by the reduction of the band bending within the ZnO NW core that follows the removal of atmospheric adsorbates and associated surface traps during the MgO growth process on one hand. and a reduced exciton–phonon coupling as a result of the mechanical stabilization of the outermost ZnO NW monolayers by the MgO shell on the other hand. The second effect is the gradual increase of the …,True,FTScAfcAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,16,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/aa7454/meta,7299952924829517178,/scholar?cites=7299952924829517178,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/aa7454/pdf,0,0,0

This general strategy is showcased through the synthesis of a three-bladed propeller nanostructure resulting from the coupling and fusion of a central triptycene hub and helical graphene nanoribbons. Importantly. these 3D graphene nanostructures show remarkable new properties that are distinct from the substituent parts. For example. the larger nanostructures show an enhancement in absorption and decreased contact resistance in optoelectronic devices. To show these enhanced properties in a device setting. the nanostructures were utilized as the electron-extracting layers in perovskite solar cells.

Fullerene derivatives are the most widely used electron transport materials (ETMs) in inverted planar perovskite solar cells. especially [6.6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PC61BM). which exhibits very good performance. However. to the best of our knowledge. the influence of adducts on fullerene-based PSCs performance has not been fully explored to date.

The varieties were placed in petri dishes with three filter papers and wet with 15 mL of a PEG-6000 solution at the following osmotic pressures: 0.-0.3.-0.5.-0.75.-1.0 and-1.5 MPa. Petri dishes were randomly distributed using 100 seeds per each experimental treatment arranged in four repetitions. After seven days. germination percentage (G) was determined. whereas seedling height (AP). root length (LR) and the accumulation of fresh (MF) and dry matters (MS) were evaluated at 15 days. The linear regression equation was established for each variety among the evaluated indicators. using the control percentage and osmotic pressure levels as values that caused germination and seedling growth reduction in 50%. From the original records. the inhibition was determined analyzing statistically the results through the single variance analysis and Duncan’s test. Results showed that wheat germination and seedling growth were affected by PEG simulated drought. it increasing with the osmotic pressure of the solutions evaluated; therefore. germination percentage and dry matter accumulation were the most sensible parameters. The varieties presented a differentiated response to the stress.

Sonora. México. using CIRNO C2008 variety from Triticum durum L.. as a model during the cropping cycle of 2016–2017 (December to April). Infrared radiators were deployed to induce experimental warming by 2 °C above ambient crop canopy temperature. in a temperature free-air controlled enhancement system. Temperature was controlled by infrared temperature sensors placed in eight plots which covered a circle of r = 1.5 m starting five days after germination until harvest. The warming treatment caused a reduction of phenophases occurrence starting at the stem extension phenophase. Such phenological responses generated a significant biological cycle reduction of 14 days. Despite this delay. CIRNO C2008 completed its biological cycle adequately. However. plant height under the warming treatment was reduced significantly and differences were particularly observed at the final phenophases of the vegetative cycle. Plant height correlated negatively with spikes length. spikes mass. and number of filled grains. Warming also reduced grain yield in 33%. The warming treatment caused a stress intensity (SI = 1-yield warming/yield control) of 39.4% and 33.2% in biomass and grain yield. respectively. The differences in stress intensities between biomass and grain yield were based on plant height reduction. Grain mass was not affected. demonstrating the crop capability for remobilization and adequate distribution of elaborated substances for the spikes under warming conditions.,True,wyzPoBMAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,12,https://peerj.com/articles/5064/,18218432946826140858,/scholar?cites=18218432946826140858,,https://peerj.com/articles/5064/,0,0,0

The objective was to determine the genetic stability index of the grain yield components in the Valle del Yaqui and Valle del Mayo. during the sowing seasons of 2007-2015. In addition. physiological and agronomic traits were evaluated in the 2015-16 cycle in an area established in CETT-910. as a representative site of the Valle del Yaqui. which were compared with the varietal descriptor and correlated with grain yield to contribute to its physioagronomic characterization. The experimental design was completely randomized and data were taken from different sites of the valleys mentioned in the state of Sonora. The highest grain yield was obtained in the Valle del Yaqui. The variables of plant height and spike length were the components of the yield with the highest index of genetic stability. The variety phenophases occurred properly without affecting the biological cycle. The grain yield in the CETT-910. in the 2015-2016 cycle. was higher than that obtained by the varietal descriptor as a result of good nutritional status and high photosynthesis.

C2H2. and electrolytic copper (technical grade) since the use of industrialized precursors helps reduce production costs. On the other hand. the process was modified from a continuous flow system with vacuum to a discontinuous one at atmospheric pressure. eliminating the use of vacuum pump. In addition. this modification optimized the consumption of gases. which reduced the waste and the emission of pollutant gases into the atmosphere. Graphene films were grown under different gas flowrates and temperatures. Then. the obtained material was characterized by TEM. Raman spectroscopy. and AFM. confirming the presence of few graphene layers. In brief. the growth time was reduced to six minutes with acetylene as a carbon precursor at 1000°C and at atmospheric pressure. with a flow rate of 30 sccm.

A maximum complex stoichiometry of 47:1 is obtained for the system with 34% of PEGylation. with an estimated binding constant of 1.2 × 104 mol−1 per binding site. as derived from aqueous solubility profiles. 2D‐NOESY experiments reveal a preferential complexation of MTX within PAMAM‐G4 branches. suggesting that high PEGylation ratios restrict drug diffusion toward innermost PAMAM cavities. On the other hand. high PEGylation degrees considerably decrease the rate of MTX release. which can be attributed to a reduced dendrimer swelling due to surface polyethylene glycol crowding.

Thermal analysis shows miscibility of the two polymer amorphous phases since a single Tg was located between those of the individual components and the melting point of the crystalline phase was depressed to 189 °C. It was found that the acid acts as a plasticizer for the PVA-CS blends and its Tg is depressed significantly to 23 °C as the acid concentration increases to 50%. Strain-stress tests also corroborate this effect. The DC conductivity of the blends follows an Arrhenius-type thermal activation behavior with activation energy of 0.1 eV in the 30–90 °C temperature range.

To accelerate the growth of the TiO 2 nanotube arrays. lactic acid was used as an electrolyte additive. The as-prepared TiO 2 nanotube arrays with a high aspect ratio were strongly adhered to the Ti substrate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results confirmed that the TiO 2 nanotube arrays were crystallized in the anatase phase. TEM images confirmed the nanotublar-like morphology of the TiO 2 nanotubes. which had a tube length and a diameter of~ 16 and~ 80 nm. respectively. The electrochemical performance of the TiO 2 nanotube array electrodes was evaluated using the cyclic voltammetry (CV). electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements. Excellent electrochemical response was observed for the electrodes based on the TiO 2 nanotube arrays. as the cells delivered a high specific capacitance of 5.12 mF/cm 2 at a scan rate of 100 mV/s and a current density of 100 µA/cm 2. The initial capacity was maintained for more than 250 cycles. Further. a remarkable rate capability response was observed. as the cell retained 88% of the initial areal capacitance when the scan rate was increased from 10 to 500 mV/s.

Among known batteries. Li ion batteries (LiBs) provide the highest gravimetric and volumetric energy densities. making them ideal candidates for use in portable electronics and plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles. Conventional LiBs use an organic polymer electrolyte. which exhibits several safety issues including leakage. poor chemical stability and flammability. The use of a solid-state (ceramic) electrolyte to produce all-solid-state LiBs can overcome all of the above issues. Also. solid-state Li batteries can operate at high voltage. thus. producing high power density. Various types of solid Li-ion electrolytes have been reported; this review is focused on the most promising solid Li-ion electrolytes based on garnet-type metal oxides.

The x ≈ 0.1 member exhibits conductivity of 1 × 10-3 S/cm at room temperature with an activation energy of 0.40 eV. The conductivity is comparable to that of commonly used polymer/liquid electrolytes. The ionic conductivity of LLT mainly depends on the size of the A-site ion cation (e.g.. La or rare earth. alkali or alkaline earth). lithium and vacancy concentration. and the nature of the B−O bond. For example. replacement of La by other rare earth elements with smaller ionic radii than that of La decreases the lithium ion conductivity. while partial substitution of La by Sr (larger ionic radii than that of La) slightly increases the lithium ion conductivity.

An operational planning problem for a grid-connected microgrid with energy sources including solar photovoltaic. wind turbine and battery energy storage system. in addition to a household load demand. is captured as a parametric mixed-integer linear programming problem (p-MILP) through parameterizations of the uncertain coordinates of wind and solar energy resources. Thus. the energy management problem - typically nonlinear - is transformed into a linear bi-level optimization problem. where choice of the parameterization scheme is made at the upper level while system operation decisions are made at the lower level.

The nanocomposites were derived from melt compounding of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in polystyrene (PS)/polyamide 6 (PA6) blends. The electrical conductivity of co-continuous PS/PA6 (50/50) blends remained constant in the semi-conductive region (6.75 × 10−8–1.50 × 10−7 S·cm−1) over a wide range of CNT loading (0.5–3.5 phr). Nevertheless. (50/50) blends presented higher electrical conductivity than PA6/CNT nanocomposites with the same effective CNT concentration. Contrary to common intuitions. at high loadings of CNTs. higher electrical conductivity was observed for the blends wherein the CNT-rich PA6 phase was in the form of dispersed droplet morphology rather than co-continuous one.

The objective of this research was to observe the effect of temperature on porosity. density and transport properties of materials. Preliminary results suggest that the material sintered at higher temperature could show enhanced performance in terms of fast ionic transport.

1209946,Impact of turbidity currents on reservoir sedimentation,2001,Giovanni De Cesare and Anton Schleiss and Felix Hermann,127,Journal of Hydraulic Engineering,1,6-16,American Society of Civil Engineers,All lakes created on natural rivers are subjected to reservoir sedimentation. The construction of a dam significantly modifies the flow conditions of natural streams inside and downstream of an artificial lake. The sediment concentration is often high during the flood season. and the entering flow shows a greater density than the ambient fluid. Suspended load can therefore be carried along the reservoir bottom to the dam in the form of turbidity currents. This paper presents research results that help to better understand this physical phenomenon. which contributes to reservoir sedimentation. It is based on in situ measurements. a laboratory scale model of turbidity currents and numerical flow simulations. The study of a thousand-year flood in the Luzzone Reservoir in the Swiss Alps using the developed computer model revealed the potential of such a tool.

The following topics are addressed: empirical formulae. semi-empirical and analytical approaches. determination of extreme pressure fluctuations at plunge pool bottoms and. finally. the transfer of these pressure fluctuations in joints underneath concrete slabs or rock blocks. Available methods on rock scour have been thoroughly investigated on their ability to represent the main physical-mechanical processes that govern scour.

In view of the sparse gauging network for rainfall monitoring. the observations from spaceborne instrumentation currently produce the only available rainfall data for a large part of the basin. Three operational and acknowledged high resolution satellite derived estimates: the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission product 3B42 (TRMM 3B42). the Famine Early Warning System product 2.0 (FEWS RFE2. 0) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Climate Prediction Centre (NOAA/CPC) morphing technique (CMORPH) are analyzed in terms of spatial and temporal repartition of the precipitations. They are compared to ground data for the wet seasons of the years 2003 to 2009 on a point to pixel basis at daily. 10-daily and monthly time steps and on a pixel to pixel basis for the wet seasons of the years 2003 to 2007 at monthly time steps. The general North-South gradient of precipitation is captured by all the analyzed products. Regarding the spatial heterogeneity. FEWS pixels are much more inter-correlated than TRMM and CMORPH pixels. For a rainfall homogeneity threshold criterion of 0.5 global mean correlation coefficient. the area of each sub-basin should not exceed a circle of 2.5° latitude/longitude radius for FEWS and a circle of 0.75° latitude/longitude radius for TRMM and CMORPH considering rectangular meshes.

In parallel. several lining systems consisting of macro-roughness concrete elements for protecting the downstream face of embankment dams have been developed.Dr. Stéphanie André carried out for the first time a systematic experimental study on stepped chutes equipped with additional macro-roughness elements with the purpose of increasing energy dissipation along the slope. The effect of endsills and blocks fixed on the steps was analyzed for alternate arrangements and different spacings. The numerous tests with various configurations of macro-roughness elements allowed a better understanding of the physical mechanism involved in the energy dissipation process. The influence of macro-turbulence phenomena such as circulation cell and transversal jet could be clearly shown. Several methods for the estimation of the residual energy at the toe of the chute ie dam. were analyzed in detail. This allowed a better understanding of the importance of the assumptions and their consequences on the flow characteristics.,True,A94xAx8AAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C,80,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/116169/files/Comm_LCH_20.pdf,11211759490670264724,/scholar?cites=11211759490670264724,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/116169/files/Comm_LCH_20.pdf,0,0,0

The resulting unsteady water release to rivers. called hydropeaking. alters the natural flow regime. Mitigating the adverse impacts of hydropeaking on aquatic ecosystems has become a crucial step in recent water policies.We developed a novel economic‐ecological diagnostic and intervention method to assess hydropeaking mitigation measures for fish habitat improvement. This method was applied to an Alpine river downstream of a complex storage hydropower scheme. The approach comprises (1) a hydropower operation model of flow regime generation and cost estimates for different mitigation measures.

Secondary currents that scale with the flow depth were found over the entire width in all experiments. These findings contradict the widespread perception that secondary currents die out at a distance of 2.5 times the flow depth from the bank. a perception which is largely based on experiments with smooth boundaries. The reported results indicate that a stable pattern of secondary currents over the entire channel width can only be sustained over a fixed horizontal bed if the bed's roughness is sufficient to provide the required transverse oscillations in the turbulent shear stresses. Contrary to laboratory flumes. alluvial river bed always provide sufficient roughness.

Labyrinth and Piano Key Weirs Liège B,,3-15,,Free crest spillways are hydraulically efficient and safe in operation. Since their discharge capacity is directly proportional to the crest length several types have been developed with the purpose to increase the length of the latter. Among these types traditional labyrinth weir spillways have been studied and used for a long time. Their hydraulic performance and the effect of the involved geometrical parameters are well known. Nevertheless. their design still has to be based on experimentally derived and generalized performance curves. The recently introduced Piano Key weirs present clear advantages regarding hydraulic performance and construction costs compared to classical labyrinth weirs. Especially its small footprint makes the PK weir an efficient and cost effective solution for the increase of the flood releasing capacity at existing concrete gravity dams. Until today only preliminary design procedures are available which cannot yet be generalized.

Within urban networks. local decentralized micro-hydropower plants (MHPs) may be inserted in the regional electricity grid or used for self-consumption at the local grid level. Nevertheless. such networks are complex and the quantification of the potential for micro-hydropower other than that achieved by replacing pressure reducing valves (PRVs) is difficult. In this work. a methodology to quantify the potential for hydropower based on the excess energy in a network is proposed and applied to a real case. A constructive solution is presented based on the use of a novel micro-turbine for energy conversion. the five blade tubular propeller (5BTP). The location of the MHP within the network is defined with an optimization algorithm that maximizes the net present value after 20 years of operation. These concepts are tested for the WSS in the city of Fribourg. Switzerland. The proposed solution captures 10% of the city’s energy potential and represents an economic interest. The results confirm the location of PRVs as potential sites for energy recovery and stress the need for careful sensitivity analysis of the consumption.

Due to this. equivalent Manning's n values for vegetated and urban areas in these tsunami inundation models are too small. causing the mitigating effect of forests and urban regions to be …,True,Dgaj5c4AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,67,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0578563415500059,1918488352701230446,/scholar?cites=1918488352701230446,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremy_Bricker/publication/276089082_On_the_Need_for_Larger_Manning's_Roughness_Coefficients_in_Depth-Integrated_Tsunami_Inundation_Models/links/569072bb08aed0aed810f993.pdf,0,0,0

This time. Super Typhoon Haiyan. also known as Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines. devastated the Eastern Visayas islands on 8 November 2013. Its classification as a super typhoon was based on its maximum sustained 1 min surface wind speed of 315 km h−1. which is equivalent to a strong Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale. This was one of the deadliest typhoon events in the Philippines' history. after the 1897 and 1912 tropical cyclones. At least 6268 individuals have been reported dead and 1061 people are missing. In addition. a wide area of destruction was observed in the Eastern Visayas. on Samar and Leyte islands. The International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS) at Tohoku University in Sendai. Japan. has deployed several teams for damage recognition. relief support and collaboration with regard to this disaster event. One of the teams. the hazard and damage evaluation team. visited the affected areas in the Eastern Visayas in mid-January 2014. In this paper. we summarize the rapid damage assessment from satellite imagery conducted days after the event and report on the inundation measurements and the damage surveyed in the field.

1210010,Statistical analysis of the effectiveness of seawalls and coastal forests in mitigating tsunami impacts in iwate and miyagi prefectures,2016,Roshanak Nateghi and Jeremy D Bricker and Seth D Guikema and Akane Bessho,11,PloS one,8,e0158375,Public Library of Science,The Pacific coast of the Tohoku region of Japan experiences repeated tsunamis. with the most recent events having occurred in 1896. 1933. 1960. and 2011. These events have caused large loss of life and damage throughout the coastal region. There is uncertainty about the degree to which seawalls reduce deaths and building damage during tsunamis in Japan. On the one hand they provide physical protection against tsunamis as long as they are not overtopped and do not fail. On the other hand. the presence of a seawall may induce a false sense of security. encouraging additional development behind the seawall and reducing evacuation rates during an event. We analyze municipality-level and sub-municipality-level data on the impacts of the 1896. 1933. 1960. and 2011 tsunamis. finding that seawalls larger than 5 m in height generally have served a protective role in these past events. reducing both death rates and the damage rates of residential buildings. However. seawalls smaller than 5 m in height appear to have encouraged development in vulnerable areas and exacerbated damage. We also find that the extent of flooding is a critical factor in estimating both death rates and building damage rates. suggesting that additional measures. such as multiple lines of defense and elevating topography. may have significant benefits in reducing the impacts of tsunamis. Moreover. the area of coastal forests was found to be inversely related to death and destruction rates. indicating that forests either mitigated the impacts of these tsunamis. or displaced development that would otherwise have been damaged.,True,Dgaj5c4AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,39,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158375,6254373245584167881,/scholar?cites=6254373245584167881,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158375,0,0,0

Existing quantitative risk assessments often ignore behavioural feedbacks that some claim lead to increased development in hazardous zones. Here. we couple a tsunami model with a land-use change model and find that hard-adaptive measures can induce a false sense of security and inadvertently lead to increased vulnerability (that is. are maladaptive). We also observe that heightened hazard awareness (a type of soft-adaptation) can reduce vulnerability. Our results have two major implications:(1) they challenge existing hazard adaptation practice by quantitatively demonstrating the potential for hard-adaptive measures to be maladaptive. and (2) they highlight that ignoring the behavioural feedbacks in hazard assessment can alter the conclusions to the extent that …,True,Dgaj5c4AAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C,21,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0137-6,7890770130559788249,/scholar?cites=7890770130559788249,,,0,0,0

Delft 3D is used to simulate the propagation of the tsunami as a shallow water wave into Kamaishi Bay. in order to estimate the time progression of water levels on each side of the breakwater. OpenFOAM's InterFOAM VOF solver with RANS k-ε turbulence is then used to simulate the unsteady overtopping of a solid breakwater caisson atop a porous rubble mound. and to calculate the total forces exerted on the breakwater by the flow. Interestingly. the simulated overtopping flow is sensitive to the turbulence model used. In comparison with experiments. the standard OpenFOAM k-ε turbulence model predicts too much entrainment of air below the overtopping jet into the fluid. thus pulling the jet quite close to the landward wall of the breakwater. For better agreement with experimental results. reduction of the turbulent eddy viscosity near the air-water interface proves necessary. Results of the simulations indicate that failure of the breakwater due to sliding or toppling was unlikely. However. the bearing stress at the heel of the caisson increased above its allowable limit due to both the water level difference across the breakwater. and due to the overtopping jet pulling away from the landward side of the caisson as the surcharge height above the caisson increased. In addition to the scour-induced failure of the rubble-mound foundation reported by other researchers. the present research indicates that measures to prevent geotechnical punching failure are also necessary to ensure integrity of the structure during overtopping events.,True,Dgaj5c4AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,21,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremy_Bricker/publication/316621068_Turbulence_Model_Effects_on_VOF_Analysis_of_Breakwater_Overtopping_during_the_2011_Great_East_Japan_Tsunami/links/59084be7a6fdccd580dd96b6/Turbulence-Model-Effects-on-VOF-Analysis-of-Breakwater-Overtopping-during-the-2011-Great-East-Japan-Tsunami.pdf,4977695093968216672,/scholar?cites=4977695093968216672,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremy_Bricker/publication/316621068_Turbulence_Model_Effects_on_VOF_Analysis_of_Breakwater_Overtopping_during_the_2011_Great_East_Japan_Tsunami/links/59084be7a6fdccd580dd96b6/Turbulence-Model-Effects-on-VOF-Analysis-of-Breakwater-Overtopping-during-the-2011-Great-East-Japan-Tsunami.pdf,0,0,0

Japanese tsunami protection guidelines stipulate that coastal defences should ensure that settlements are shielded from the coastal inundation that would result from Level 1 tsunami events (with return periods in the order of about 100 years). However. the overtopping mechanism and leeward inundation heights of tsunami bores as they hit coastal structures has received little attention in the past. To ascertain this phenomenon. the authors conducted physical experiments using a dam-break mechanism. which could generate bores that overtopped different types of structures. The results indicate that it is necessary to move away from only considering the tsunami inundation height at the beach. and also consider the bore velocity as it approaches the onshore area.

This has resulted in coastal residents being aware about the destructive power of tsunamis. despite no such events having taken place in their country in recent times.

Japan has relied on imported fossil fuels for electricity generation. but is quickly increasing its share of renewable energy sources. Recent development has been in biomass. geothermal. wind. and solar PV. though little attention has been given to the potential of marine energy resources. The present paper carries out an analysis of the economic viability of this resource using real wave and tidal current data. The results show that marine energy technologies could be cost-effective at several locations in Japan. and can pragmatically add reliable and predictable power to the energy generation mix.

The testing is performed by a new testing device mounted firmly on the bolt head. No special adjustment of the bolt head is necessary to mount the device and to perform testing. The device triggers oscillations of the grouted bolt by a small hammer. Acceleration history of the device in the direction of the bolt axis is recorded and the dominant frequency is determined. A correlation between the dominant frequency of the grouted bolt and the percent of the bolt length grouted to the rock around the borehole is established in cases when it is evident that the grout properly fixes the bolt at least near its head. No preparation of bolt heads required. the simplicity of use of the measuring device. as well as the ease and short time of testing. are principal advantages of the new method.RÉSUMÉ:L'analyse …,True,lVFWVswAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,10,https://onepetro.org/conference-paper/ISRM-9CONGRESS-1999-292,1204369039803120429,/scholar?cites=1204369039803120429,,,0,0,0

Vol. 1,",,1119-1124,,It has been noted that the saturated unloaded swelling rock does not swell nor disintegrate when submerged in water. Conversely. if the same rock is partly desaturated and then submerged in water. it shows swelling effects. Swelling effects become more pronounced with the increase in desaturation. The paper shows in which way this fact influences test sample preparation procedures. testing program. tunnel design practices. and measures to be undertaken during excavation in saturated rock in order to avoid negative effects of swelling. A new characteristic swelling rock curve. nonlinear on the semilogarithmic scale. can be obtained by balancing the swelling zone with the partial desaturation zone.

1210044,Swelling rock desaturation and its influence on underground structures,2000,Ivan Vrkljan,,,,,International Society for Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering,The influence of swelling rock desaturation on its behavior in tunneling is described. The swelling potential of the desaturated rock will be more pronounced. when compared to similar rock in saturated state. A new characteristic curve for the swelling rock mass was defined based on the approach defined by Kovari et al.(1988). At that. the influence of desaturation on activation of the swelling rock potential was taken into account. The proposed curve is nonlinear on a semilogarithmic scale which emphasizes even more the observed phenomenon that a small allowed floor heave significantly reduces the swelling pressure. ie that a small lining resistance may significantly reduce the floor heave.,True,lVFWVswAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,https://onepetro.org/conference-paper/ISRM-IS-2000-627,6871279316026580355,/scholar?cites=6871279316026580355,,,0,0,0

The complexity of the problems is illustrated by the experience gained during the construction of two tunnels in Algeria. The first example shows a case when swelling. predicted based on the laboratory tests. did not occur during the execution. The second example shows a case of rock swelling in a tunnel floor occuring by a completely different mechanism of swelling than that established by prior testing. The experiences presented confirm the fact that the law of swelling determined in a laboratory cannot be copied directly to in situ conditions.RESUME: Les methodes d''etablissement des etudes pour les tunnels dans les materiaux qui gonflent sont chargees d''un grand nombre d''inconnues relatives au comportement des roches gonflantes …,True,lVFWVswAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://onepetro.org/conference-paper/ISRM-7CONGRESS-1991-272,3126264766499356130,/scholar?cites=3126264766499356130,,,0,0,0

1210053,Enhancing the economic value of large investments in Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) through inclusion of ecosystems services benefits,2017,Santiago Urrestarazu Vincent and Mohanasundar Radhakrishnan and Laszlo Hayde and Assela Pathirana,9,Water,11,841,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Although Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) are used in cities across the world as effective flood adaptation responses. their economic viability has frequently been questioned. Inclusion of the monetary value of ecosystem services (ES) provided by SuDS can increase the rate of return on investments made. Hence. this paper aims at reviewing the enhancement of the economic value of large-scale investments in SuDS through inclusion of ecosystem services. This study focuses on the flood reduction capacity and the ES benefits of green roofs and rain barrels in the combined sewerage network of Montevideo Municipality in Uruguay. The methodology comprises a cost–benefit analysis—with and without monetised ES provided by SuDS—of two drainage network configurations comprising:(i) SuDS; and (ii) SuDS and detention storage. The optimal drainage design for both these drainage configurations have been determined using SWMM-EA. a tool which uses multi-objective optimisation based evolutionary algorithm (EA) and the storm water management model (SWMM). In both design configurations. total benefits comprising both flood reduction and ES benefits are always higher than their costs. The use of storage along with SuDS provides greater benefits with a larger reduction in flooding. and thus is more cost-effective than using SuDS alone. The results show that. for both of the drainage configurations. the larger investments are not beneficial unless ES benefits are taken into account. Hence. it can be concluded that the inclusion of ES benefits is necessary to justify large-scale investments in SuDS.

In the aftermath of the golden age of megaprojects. the Central Arizona Project (CAP) is the culmination of two social components of the New Deal era; a great belief in the engineering skills to build up big water infrastructures and the politicking practices for territorial sovereignty over water in the West (Willey & Gottlieb. 1982). These prerequisites for success. which are key to understand how the idea of Central Arizona Project came up. have deepened in the context of the increased economic development of the West affecting the post Second World War period. Furthermore. the Central Arizona Project mirrors a transitory phase towards a much decentralized and multi-layered decision-making process in water issues. Lastly. choosing to come back to the history of the CAP enables to better appreciate what is going on in the current context of looming water shortage in the West. In addition to be designed as a technical response to an excessive groundwater pumping. the Central Arizona Project is also the product of specific and temporary alliances between elites from the political. economic and administrative spheres. which have structured and still structure social tensions with regard to the existing drought situation. In Arizona. support for the CAP had its origins in a struggle between individual states (anxious to develop their economies) for a share of the Colorado River.

1210064,Subsurface drainage of valley bottom irrigated rice schemes in tropical savannah: case studies of Tiefora and Moussodougou in Burkina Faso,2015,Amadou Keïta,,,,,,The contrasted global population growth with the multiplication of the constraints to developing new irrigation systems puts a special challenge upon human crop production systems that needs to be taken up. The populations in many countries in Asia. Middle East and Africa are expected to double in the coming 50 years. The experience of the green revolution in Asia–during which 70% of food production increase was provided by irrigated agriculture–shows that there is not only a need to strive to increase such crop production systems. but also to improve the production efficiency of existing ones. In fact. as a much worrying case. rice production in valley bottom irrigated lands of African Tropical Savannah is far to yield the expected amount of cereals. One of the major constraints to this production is iron toxicity subsequent to poor drainage conditions. According to Africa Rice. at least 60% of the Tropical Savannah swampy valley bottoms are affected by different degree of iron toxicity. The yield in many areas drops to zero. leaving behind millions of disappointed and impoverished farmers. Therefore. it is not surprising that there is strong research dynamic–ranging from agronomy to microbiology–that strives to propose alleviating solutions to rice iron toxicity. Because prevalent anoxic conditions in the soil combined with iron reducing bacteria development were found a basic contributing factor to iron toxicity. this research has chosen to investigate subsurface drainage potential contributions to solving this issue.,True,FCt0tW4AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,4,https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/486083,18249378389708351393,/scholar?cites=18249378389708351393,,https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/486083,0,0,0
1210065,Comparative non-linear regression-case of infiltration rate increase from upstream in valley,2014,Amadou Keita and Hamma Yacouba and Laszlo G Hayde and Bart Schultz,28,International Agrophysics,3,,-,In Tropical Savannah flooded valley soils. very low infiltration rates often result in acidic conditions favourable to high concentrations of metallic ions. toxic for rice. Determination of the under-phreatic infiltration rate is important in drainage design to reclaim degraded soils. Several studies have addressed the mapping of the infiltration rate. Yet. its relationship with the toposequence of the valley is not clarified. This paper has investigated such a possibility. examining the case of the irrigated rice valley of Tiefora. Burkina Faso. Nine boreholes–from 1 to 5 m deep–were implemented from upstream to downstream. The Lefranc permeability test of the under-phreatic level in waterlogged soils–used when the impervious layer is close to soil surface or absent–was conducted. First. a comparative regression was applied to the data. including all the parameters of the regression curves. In the case of dissimilarity of the infiltration processes. the comparison focused on the final permeability. The results show a permeability increase from upstream (0.10±0.10 cm h-1) to downstream (greater than 20±10 cm h-1 in some places). Taking into account such a permeability increase in the subsurface drainage system design would result in implementation of more efficient and cost effective systems.,True,FCt0tW4AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,4,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-9eb4cd03-1367-4c13-98be-58225506aca0,11344516673823208170,/scholar?cites=11344516673823208170,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-9eb4cd03-1367-4c13-98be-58225506aca0/c/05_Keita_28_3.pdf,0,0,0

Traditionally. the flow within a river basin has been managed using a traditional technology called Subak irrigation. These schemes are based on the cropping patterns and indigenous water management. which are organized by the respective Subak associations. Unfortunately. this traditional technology is facing challenges: water shortage and competition with other water users. In order to sustain agriculture production of Subak irrigation schemes in the Yeh Ho River Basin. the available discharge in Yeh Ho River was analyzed in this study in light of the supply to the Subak irrigation schemes within the river basin. By using the Weibull formula. the historic supply data of several diversion weirs were analyzed independently. Based on this analysis it was possible to determine the water balance of the Subak irrigation schemes behind each diversion weir. Therefore a system approach was developed based on the managed flows within the river basin and the characteristics of the Subak irrigation schemes. The conclusion is that the discharge in the river will remain the most important factor to sustain the characteristic paddy terraces of these Subak irrigation schemes.,True,FCt0tW4AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,3,http://cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/article/view/3935,17452261931568414330,/scholar?cites=17452261931568414330,,https://cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/article/download/3935/2513,0,0,0

Subsurface drainage has been used for many areas to alleviate waterlogging. However. this drainage is dependent on clay distribution. type and location. The current paper analyses these factors for the case of Tiefora. a 16 ha valley bottom irrigated rice scheme in Burkina Faso. For this purpose. nine boreholes. with depths from 2 to 6 m. were realised. A total of 51 samples of soils were extracted at various depths. based on soil changes in texture and colour. These samples underwent grain-size-analysis. A comparative non-linear regression was performed on the clay distribution. Quadratic regression was the most appropriate. In addition. clay proportions were high-20-30% in the 2 m topsoil-in the upstream and middle areas. A more important-30-40%-peak was reached in the downstream area at 1 m. with a much smaller thickness (less than 50 cm) and higher permeability.

The decision-making process in a Subak irrigation scheme takes into account political. economic. social and cultural (religious) aspects. Multifunctional ecosystems in a sustainable way of agriculture are implemented in the Subak irrigation schemes. particularly in the technology of such systems.In the middle of the twentieth century. as consequence of ongoing population growth and land conversion Balinese farmers were having difficulties in meeting the ever-growing demand for rice. In addition. the problem of insufficient water in the dry season developed. In order to increase the irrigation water supply in the Yeh Ho River Basin the government constructed the Telaga Tunjung Dam. based on the cultivated hectares of paddy fields (sawah). However. since the dam was built the downstream river flow was reduced quite significantly and the process of water sharing among the Subak irrigation schemes was changed.

At this moment there is no generally accepted calculation method for their design. Based on physical model investigations an approximate theoretical model has been developed.

Main elements of the theoretical model:-1st part of the upper basin. dimensioned on the basis of throwing distance of free jet.-2nd part of the upper basin. calculated by impulse-momentum theorem.-3rd part of the upper basin. the lateral weir. for whose calculation a new method has been developed. During the physical model investigation of the lateral weir it has been proved that for a suitable velocity distribution in the lower basin a relatively homogeneous discharge distribution is required along the lateral weir. This can be attained by a linearly changing height of the weir. No research is required in the lower basin if the influx from the weir has a uniform distribution. The practical applicability of the complex theoretical description adjusted to the different phenomena was checked by the results on the double stilling basin with axis broken by 90.

1210079,Seepage analysis of the headwork of Chanda Mohana irrigation scheme. Nepal,2011,S Kaini,,,,,Delft: UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education,Most of the irrigation schemes in Nepal are in the Terai (plain) Region. Most of the weir type irrigation headworks built in alluvial rivers in Terai fail due to seepage before the end of their economic life period. For these headworks constructed on permeable foundation. seepage is a common cause of failure. In this research. a typical headwork site. Chanda Mohana Irrigation Scheme. Nepal. was selected as a case study for  the seepage analysis. The headwork of  this scheme has a weir and an under sluice portion. which  is situated at  the confluence of Budhi and Katle Streams. Initially. the confluence point of Budhi. Katle and Jala Streams was at the same location where the present east (left) head regulator exists. After the construction of the headwork.  the  Jala  Stream  was  diverted  towards  the  East.  As  a  consequence.  seepage problem was seen at the headwork even at the time of commissioning in 2000.  The  data  collection  was  done  at  the  field  level  including  discussions  with  technicians involved in this scheme as key informants as well as with local people. Geological study and hydrological analysis of  the study area were done. Laboratory  tests for soil parameters were also carried out. MSeep model (2D) was run for different scenarios to represent the different maintenance works carried out in 2000. 2009 and 2010 and for proposed work.

Within the body of these institutions. it occupies a key position in that it is one of the few institutions concerned primarily with water and agriculture. Indeed it may be said that ICID is the only organisation of its type that is primarily concerned with water and agriculture.Given that agriculture is a major user of water. ICID needs to be active in improving the understanding of the issues surrounding water and agriculture. and in turn.

We measure two indices of the relative impact of climate across countries. impact per capita. and impact per GDP. These measures sum market impacts across the climate-sensitive economic sectors of each country. Both indices reveal that climate change will have serious distributional impact across countries. grouped by income per capita. We predict that poor countries will suffer the bulk of the damages from climate change. Although adaptation. wealth. and technology may influence distributional consequences across countries. we argue that the primary reason that poor countries are so vulnerable is their location. Countries in the low latitudes start with very high temperatures. Further warming pushes these countries ever further away from optimal temperatures for climate-sensitive economic sectors.,True,mPkVIgEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,717,https://www.jstor.org/stable/44378961,9004388616787004622,/scholar?cites=9004388616787004622,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.167.963&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Using data from a survey of more than 9.000 farmers across 11 African countries. a cross-sectional approach estimates how farm net revenues are affected by climate change compared with current mean temperature. Revenues fall with warming for dryland crops (temperature elasticity of −1.9) and livestock (−5.4). whereas revenues rise for irrigated crops (elasticity of 0.5). which are located in relatively cool parts of Africa and are buffered by irrigation from the effects of warming. At first. warming has little net aggregate effect as the gains for irrigated crops offset the losses for dryland crops and livestock.

Country case studies provide a perspective of recent and future water pricing and water management issues. These studies show that countries have different reasons for charging for water. including cost recovery. redistribution of income. improvement of water allocation. and water conservation. Most countries are now gradually turning over management responsibilities of water supplies to private enterprises and nongovernmental organizations. Some countries are developing legal frameworks to decentralize water management. and encouraging the private sector to become involved through incentives. Still their water supply authorities have the power to set and adjust water rates. A large majority are implementing price schemes to recover operation and maintenance costs from users. and some are also recovering at least a portion of capital costs. Almost all country reports discuss the need for volumetric pricing. metering. moving away from uniform tariffs. and abolishing minimum prices. Many specify the need to significantly increase water charges to all users. The report identifies the development of formal transferable water rights and water markets as crucial issues to consider for managing water resources in the future. The report also recognizes the need to provide incentives to water suppliers and consumers. and the use of measuresto protect the environment. such as pollution taxes.

1210097,Markets for water: Potential and performance,1998,K William Easter Mark W Rosegrant and Ariel Dinar,15,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Markets for Water: Potential and Performance dispels many of the myths surrounding water markets and gives readers a comprehensive picture of the way that markets have developed in different parts of the world. It is possible. for example. for a water market to fail. and for the transaction costs in water markets to be excessive. Too often water trading is banned because the water resources have been developed with public funds and the water agencies do not want to lose control over water. There is also a concern that poor farmers or households will be disadvantaged by water trading. These concerns about public resources and the poor are not very different from those that have been voiced in the past about land sales. The problem is that in many cases the poor already have limited access to resources. but this limit is not due to water trading. In fact. water trading is likely to expand the access to water for many small-scale farmers. Markets for Water: Potential and Performance provides an analytical framework for water market establishment. It develops the necessary conditions for water markets and illustrates how they can improve both water management and economic efficiency.

Enhanced with a detailed and comprehensive index. Climate Change and Agriculture is highly recommended for academic library environmental studies and economic studies reference collections and supplemental reading lists. The Midwest Book Review Despite its great importance. there are surprisingly few economic studies of the impact of climate on agriculture and how agriculture can adapt under a variety of conditions. This book examines 22 countries across four continents. including both developed and developing economies. It provides both a good analytical basis for additional work and solid results for policy debate concerning income distributional effects such as abatement. adaptation. and equity. Agriculture and grazing are a central sector in the livelihood of many people. particularly in developing countries. This book uses the Ricardian method to examine the impact of climate change on agriculture. It also quantifies how farmers adapt to climate. The findings suggest that agriculture in developing countries is more sensitive to climate than agriculture in developed countries. Rain-fed cropland is generally more sensitive to warming than irrigated cropland and cropland is more sensitive than livestock. The adaptation to climate change results reveal that farmers make many adjustments including switching crops and livestock species. adopting irrigation. and moving between livestock and crops.

1210105,Economics of reservoir sedimentation and sustainable management of dams,2001,Alesssandro Palmieri and F Shah and A Dinar,61,Journal of environmental management,2,149-163,Academic Press,Accepted practice has been to design and operate reservoirs to fill with sediment. generating benefits from remaining storage over a finite period of time. The consequences of sedimentation and project abandonment are left to the future. This ‘future’ has already arrived for many existing reservoirs and most others will eventually experience a similar fate. thereby imposing substantial costs on society. Such costs could be avoided if sedimentation was minimized and dams were allowed to live forever. The fact that the world’s inventory of suitable reservoir sites is limited provides an additional reason for encouraging the sustainable management of dams.

This book provides a survey of some of the major developments in the field of strategic bargaining models with an emphasize on the role of threats in the negotiation process. Threats are all actions outside the negotiation room that negotiators have ate their disposal and the use of these actions affect the bargaining position of all negotiators. Of course. each negotiator aims to strengthen his own position. Examples of threats are the announcement of a strike by a union in centralized wage bargaining. or a nation’s announcement of a trade war directed against other nations in negotiations for trade liberalization. This book is organized on the basis of a simple guiding principle: The situation in which none of the parties involved in the negotiations has threats at its disposal is the natural benchmark for negotiations where the parties can make threats. Also on the technical level. negotiations with variable threats build on and extend the techniques applied in analyzing bargaining situations without threats. The first part of this book. containing chapter 3-6. presents the no-threat case. and the second part. containing chapter 7-10. extends the analysis for negotiation situations where threats are present.

The governance by the Mekong River Commission (MRC) of the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) is weak. This study investigates the welfare effects in the year 2030 arising from strengthening the MRC’s governance versus joint management of the entire MRB. Without joint management. strengthening the MRC’s governance has a huge potential to achieve welfare gains and it requires that the interests of all stakeholders be equally balanced. A bargaining approach shows that the LMB has no incentive to negotiate with China and is better off strengthening the MRC’s governance instead. If such strengthening could be realized. further welfare gains of joint management by a wider and stronger MRC. including China. would be very small.,True,ZjQAJqkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,31,https://www.jstor.org/stable/26378373,10776213205479144722,/scholar?cites=10776213205479144722,,,0,0,0

1210116,Antitrust enforcement with price-dependent fines and detection probabilities,2010,Harold Houba and Evgenia Motchenkova and Quan Wen,30,Economics Bulletin,3,2017-2027,AccessEcon,We analyze the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement in repeated oligopoly models in which both fines and detection probabilities depend on the cartel price. Such fines reflect actual guidelines. Inspections based on monitoring of market prices imply endogenous detection probabilities. Without monitoring. fines that are either fixed or proportional to illegal gains cannot eradicate the monopoly price. but more-than-proportional fines can. Policy design with inspections based on price-monitoring implies that the profit-maximizing cartel price always lies below the monopoly price independently of the fine structure. These results offer partial support for the current practice of monitoring and more-thanproportional fines.We would like to thank an anonymous referee and the editor for suggestions which were very helpful in improving the present paper.

Unanimity bargaining determines the water allocation and monetary transfers. We translate International Water Law into either disagreement outcomes or individual aspiration levels. In the former case. we apply the asymmetric Nash bargaining solution. in the latter case the agents have to compromise in order to agree and we apply the asymmetric Nash rationing solution. In both cases the optimization problem is separable into two subproblems: the efficient water allocation that maximizes utilitarian welfare given the geography matrix; and the determination of the monetary transfers associated with the weights.

Efficiency deals with using water for its highest-value use so that no gains from reallocation remain unexploited. Sustainability deals with the strategic incentives of countries to comply with some agreed water allocation schedule so that the allocation is stable over time or under (water) stress.

Antitrust fines obey four legal principles: punishments should fit the crime. proportionality. bankruptcy considerations. and minimum fines. Bankruptcy considerations limit maximum fines. ensure abnormal cartel profits and impose a challenge for optimal antitrust enforcement. We integrate the mentioned legal principles into an in finitely-repeated oligopoly model. We derive the optimal level of detection activities and the optimal fine schedule that achieves maximal social welfare under these legal principles. The optimal fine schedule remains below the maximum fine and induces collusion on a lower price by making it more attractive than collusion on higher prices. For a range of low cartel prices. the fine is set to the legal minimum. Raising minimum fines will enable the cartel to raise its price and is better avoided.

Stationary subgame perfect equilibria (SSPE) exist whenever the geometric mean of the players’ risk coefficients. ratios of utility differences between alternatives. is at most one. SSPEs ensure agreement within finite expected time. For generic parameter values. SSPEs are unique and exclude Condorcet cycles. In an SSPE. at least two players propose their best alternative and at most one player proposes his middle alternative with positive probability.

These practices involve pumping of water for irrigation from combinations of large diameter. shallow wells (noras) and small diameter. deep boreholes (furos). Excess irrigation water returns to the aquifer and mixes with water from the regional groundwater flow system. This irrigation return flow is concentrated by strong evapotranspiration and by flushing of fertilisers. The concentration increase induces cation exchange. whereby Ca on the soil exchanger is replaced by Na. The mixing in the aquifer allows application of a mixing cell model which may then be used to calculate transmissivities from the Cl mass balance.

Selected Papers on Hydrogeology,,69-85,,In Campina de Faro. an area in the south of Portugal. agricultural practices have caused the rise of nitrate concentrations in groundwater to extremely high levels. frequently exceeding 250 mg/l in the upper aquifers. While the origin of the nitrate contamination lies in the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers. irrigation with local. nitrate-rich groundwater contributes significantly to the problem. This additional source of nitrogen for the crops is generally not taken into account in fertilization plans. Furthermore. irrigation return flow. concentrated by strong evapotranspiration. gradually increases nitrate and overall salinity levels in the upper aquifers. Nitrate contamination is studied with respect to both its temporal evolution and spatial distribution. Indicator-geostatistical techniques are applied. resulting in maps that indicate the probability of nitrate concentrations exceeding predetermined threshold values. They indicate that the highest contamination levels occur in aquifers with high groundwater residence times and low recharge rates. enhancing the impact of the groundwater recycling process induced by irrigation.

Portugal. The results are employed in a decision support system currently under development for an integrated water resources management scheme in the region. Such a scheme is crucial for several reasons. including the extreme seasonal and annual variations in rainfall. the effect of climate change on more frequent and long-lasting droughts. the continuously increasing water demand and the high risk of a single-source water supply policy. The latter was revealed during the severe drought of 2004 and 2005. when surface reservoirs were depleted and the regional water demand could not be met. despite the drilling of emergency wells. For screening and selection. quantitative criteria are based on aquifer properties and well yields. whereas qualitative criteria are defined by water quality indices.

Stable isotopic data (18O. 2H) indicate that the recharge of the alluvial aquifer is dominated by high-altitude meteoric water originating from the High-Atlas Mountains that border the plain to the south. Tritium globally indicates the presence of recent groundwater. as well as mixing between old and recent groundwater. Alluvial groundwater salinity varies from east to west. This variability is mainly induced by enrichment in chloride and sulfate salt contents.

However. these time scales can be too coarse for the systems to which they are being applied and can lead to over- or underexploitation of groundwater.

The need for a more economical design has consequences for the choice of improving the bearing capacity of concrete-lined pressure tunnels. One of the techniques available to improve their applicability is by pre-stressing the final lining with a highpressure cement grout.Since it first appeared in Seeber [19851]. the loadline diagram has been widely used to determine the bearing capacity of pre-stressed concrete-lined pressure tunnels.

The elastic behaviour of the rock mass was assured in the model by simply providing adequate cohesion. The study reveals that the distribution of excavation-inducedstresses and deformations in the space surrounding rock mass having anisotropic properties differs from that obtained under the assumption of isotropic properties.

Theadvantage of this approach is that it is simple to use. and will often yield areasonable approximation to actual sediment removal efficiency. However. idealsettling theory does not quantify turbulence. and various empirical andanalytical methods have previously been proposed to estimate settling basinperformance.Settling basin is generally accomplished by reducing the velocity to the lowestpermissible magnitude for the longest possible period. An expansion transitionby widening the approach channel and lowering its floor are possible to reducethe flow velocity and make it possible for sediment to settle out of suspensiondue to gravity. However. the movement of sediment is vertical direction is notonly due to gravity alone. but also under the combined action of gravity andvertical component of turbulence.Effective design of settling basin therefore depends upon an analysis of the effectof turbulence on deposition.

1210168,Prestressed concrete-lined pressure tunnels: towards improved safety and economical design; Dissertation. UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education. Delft.,2015,YF Simanjuntak,,,,,Leiden: CRC Press/Balkema,At the global scale. nearly two billion people are still lacking reliable electricity supply. Hydropower can be a source of sustainable energy. provided that environmental considerations are taken into account and economic aspects of hydropower design are addressed. Pressure tunnels are relatively expensive constructions. particularly when steel linings are used. Concrete linings can be economically attractive; however. their applicability is limited by the low tensile strength of concrete. Techniques to improve the bearing capacity of concrete tunnel linings have become one of the interesting topics in hydropower research. One of the techniques available is through prestressing the cast-in-place concrete lining by grouting the circumferential gap between the concrete lining and the rock mass with cement-based grout at high pressure. As a consequence. compressive stresses are induced in the lining. This is meant to offset tensile stresses and avoid tendency for longitudinal cracks to occur in the lining due to radial expansion during tunnel operation. Moreover. as the grout fills discontinuities in the rock mass and hardens. the permeability of the rock mass is reduced. This is favourable in view of reducing seepage. In order to maintain the prestressing effects in the concrete lining. the rock mass has to be firm enough to take the grouting pressure. The grouting pressure. taking into account a certain safety factor. should remain below the smallest principal stress in the rock mass. Since the prestress in the concrete lining is produced by the support from the rock mass. this technique is also called the passive prestressing technique.

The increased polymer chain dynamics under nanoconfinement significantly reduces the modulus of the conjugated polymer and largely delays the onset of crack formation under strain. As a result. our fabricated semiconducting film can be stretched up to 100% strain without affecting mobility. retaining values comparable to that of amorphous silicon.

Direct deposition from vapor to solid. which competes with NW crystal growth through the molten catalyst droplet. is suppressed by assigning a very small kinetic coefficient at the solid–vapor interface. The thermodynamic self-consistency of the model is demonstrated by its ability to reproduce the equilibrium contact angles at the VLS junction.

We examine the interplay between strain and Sn composition distributions to gain insight into how these affect optical properties. There is a two-fold synergistic effect on the optical properties produced by the core–shell nanowire geometry.

Unfortunately. the lithium-ion conductivities of the state-of-the-art polymer electrolytes are few orders of magnitude lower than those of liquid electrolytes at room temperature. In this work. we focus on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). which has shown the highest lithium ion conductivity in polymer electrolytes so far. At high salt concentrations. the lithium conductivity of a PEO electrolyte is strongly reduced because of the formation of ionic aggregates. Using molecular dynamics simulations and rigorously taking into account ionic correlations. we show how introducing a secondary site with a specific chemical structure in the backbone of PEO can greatly enhance the lithium conductivity of such concentrated electrolytes.

The stretchability and mechanical robustness of unfilled elastomers can be enhanced by introducing easier-to-break cross-links. e.g. through the multi-network structure. which also causes stress–strain hysteresis indicating strain-induced damage. However. it remains unclear whether cross-link breakage follows a predictable pattern that can be used to understand the damage evolution with strain. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics and topology analyses of the polymer network. we find that bond-breaking events are controlled by the evolution of the global shortest path length between well-separated cross-links. which is both anisotropic and hysteretic with strain.

Adding a constant driving force (Δ F mc) into the AC-PFM will result in the competition between the anisotropic shrink and the isotropic growth. which may lead to different phase shape at the steady state. Through numerical simulations and theoretical analyses. three types of evolution behaviors that depend on the strength of Δ F mc have been concluded: shrink resembling Wulff. growth resembling Wulff and growth deviating from Wulff. In other words. in the limit of Δ F mc→ 0. the steady-state shape predicted by PFM follows the Wulff shape. but deviates from Wulff when Δ F mc grows substantially. as the Δ F mc term represents the isotropic feature of the growth dynamics while the other parts denote the anisotropic feature in the Wulff shape.

We show evidence of a transition between two regimes. depending on the interfacial roughness: When the roughness is small. the boundary conductance is constant. taking values close to the conductance of the corresponding planar interface. When the roughness is larger. the conductance becomes larger than the planar interface conductance and the relative increase is found to be close to the increase of the interfacial area.

In the resulting full-potential LAPW method (FLAPW). all contributions to the potential are completely taken into account in the Hamiltonian matrix elements. The accuracy of the method—already well known for clean metal surfaces—is demonstrated for the case of a nearly free (noninteracting) O 2 molecule which is a severe test case of the method because of its large anisotropic charge distribution. Detailed comparisons show that the accuracy of the FLAPW results for O 2 exceeds that of existing state-of-the-art local-density linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals (LCAO)-type calculations. and that …,True,wb7aK20AAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,2355,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.24.864,9398493469934494486,/scholar?cites=9398493469934494486,,,0,0,0

The theoretical value of the work function for films with five and more layers is found to be within 0.05 eV of the experimental value of 4.63 eV. It is demonstrated that a film of seven layers is sufficiently thick to describe surface states and surface resonance states. An analysis of the dispersion and the change of bonding for the surface (resonance) states of Σ symmetry suggests that the discrepancies between experimental and theoretical surface energy band structures concerning surface states and surface-resonance states near the M symmetry point are due to displacements of the surface atoms in the high-temperature phase of the W (001) system.,True,wb7aK20AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,70,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.29.5267,3045936368018131358,/scholar?cites=3045936368018131358,,,0,0,0
1210248,Color of pure and alkali-doped cerium sulfide: A local-density-functional study,1996,M-A Perrin and E Wimmer,54,Physical review B,4,2428,American Physical Society,The electronic structure and mechanisms for the optical excitations of pure and Na-doped γ-Ce 2 S 3 have been investigated using first-principles local-density-functional theory. The energy-band structures from augmented-spherical-wave calculations indicate that the S 3p→ Ce 5d interband transitions give rise to absorptions in the ultraviolet. whereas the observed red color of γ-Ce 2 S 3 is associated with localized Ce 4f→ 5d excitations. The cationic vacancies in γ-Ce 2 S 3 (which is derived from the cubic Th 3 P 4 structure) lead to the formation of vacancy bands. which are split off from the top of the S 3p valence band. Na doping removes these vacancy bands and homogenizes the band edges of the valence and conduction bands. As a consequence. the onset of the f→ d transitions is shifted slightly to larger energies and becomes sharper. which is consistent with an observed change in the color of γ-Ce 2 S 3 …,True,wb7aK20AAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,62,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.54.2428,11733430603828484388,/scholar?cites=11733430603828484388,,,0,0,0

Temperature calculation and dilution measurement,1999,David Lacroix and C Boudot and G Jeandel,8,The European Physical Journal Applied Physics,1,61-69,EDP Sciences,A spectroscopic study of the GTAW plasma-plume created during the welding of stainless steel and other materials (iron. nickel and chromium) has been carried out. The spectra of these plasmas have been studied for several welding parameters. Temperature calculations are based on the observation of relative intensities and shapes of the emission peaks. We assume that the plasma is in local thermal equilibrium. The temperature is calculated with the Boltzmann plot method from twelve iron emission lines (in the range 368–385 nm): it varies between 9650 and 12100 K. Dilution experiments have been carried out. We checked the mixing of metals: during welding of two different metallic plates and during welding with an Inconel wire. Dilution is monitored following the intensity of some characteristic emission lines (chromium and nickel).

It has been found that the reduction of the thermal conductivity scales with the nanostructure transmissivity. a property entirely determined by the modulation geometry. irrespectively of the material choice. Tuning of the thermal conductivity is possible by the nanostructure width-modulation without strict limitations for the modulation profile. In addition. a very significant constriction thermal resistance due to width-discontinuity has been identified. in analogy to the contact thermal resistance between two dissimilar materials. The constriction thermal resistance also scales with the modulated nanostructure transmissivity. Our conclusions are generic indicating that a wide range of materials can be used for the modulated nanostructures.

We first study this situation for different types of molecular interactions. using models for gold particles suspended in octane and in water. As already reported in experiments. very high heat fluxes and temperature elevations (leading eventually to particle destruction) can be observed in such situations.

The use of an ultrafast camera ensures a high control of the reproducibility. because a thorough measurement of each bubble lifetime is performed. Next. an analytical cavitation-based model is developed to assess the thermodynamic bubble properties. This study demonstrates that the bubble evolution is adiabatic and driven by inertial forces.

Under increasing nanoparticle temperature. the heat flux saturates. which is in sharp contrast with the case of flat interfaces. where a critical heat flux is observed followed by development of a vapor layer and heat flux drop. These differences in heat transfer are explained by the curvature-induced pressure close to the nanoparticle. which inhibits boiling.

We show that the cross-plane conductivity of the superlattices is very low and close to the conductivity of bulk amorphous silicon even for amorphous layers as thin as sime 6 Å. The cross-plane thermal conductivity weakly increases with temperature which is associated with a decrease of the Kapitza resistance with temperature at the crystalline/amorphous interface. This property is further investigated considering the spatial analysis of the phonon density of states in domains close to the interface. Interestingly. the crystalline/amorphous superlattices are shown to display large thermal anisotropy. according to the characteristic sizes of elaborated structures.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,We have proposed recently that the mechanical properties of nano‐filled elastomers are governed by the kinetics of rupture and re‐birth of glassy bridges which link neighboring nanoparticles and allow for building large rigid clusters of finite life‐times. The latter depend on parameters such as the temperature. the nanoparticle‐matrix interaction. and the distance between neighboring fillers. Most importantly these life‐times depend on the history of deformation of the samples. We show that this death and re‐birth process allows for predicting unusual non‐linear and plastic behavior for these systems. We study in particular the behavior after large deformation amplitude cycles. At some point we put the systems at rest under large deformation. and let the stress relax in this new deformed state. During this relaxation process the life‐time of glassy bridges increases progressively. even for large deformation states.

While the boundary conductance is usually ascribed to the coupling between metal phonons and dielectric phonons. in this work we examine the influence of a direct coupling between the metal electrons and the dielectric phonons. The effect of electron–phonon processes is generally believed to be resistive and tends to decrease the overall thermal boundary conductance as compared to the phonon–phonon conductance σ p. Here. we find that the effect of a direct electron-phonon interfacial coupling σ e is to enhance the effective thermal conductance between the metal and the dielectric. Resistive effects turn out to be important only for thin films of metals that have a low electron–phonon coupling strength. Two approaches are explored to reach these conclusions.

We emphasize the importance of nanoscale effects in the dynamics of the nanobubble. We first analyze the evolution of the temperature inside the bubble. We show that the temperature drops by hundredths of kelvins in a few picoseconds. just after nanobubble formation.

Using a fiber network removes the necessity of the presence of a binder. thus unlike spheres. fibers can be suspended in air. As a consequence. fibers can scatter sunlight efficiently due to the high refractive index difference between air and silica. and efficiently emit thermal radiation due to mitigation of internal reflection losses that arise at the binder air interface.

These results highlight possibilities to control both the location where the radiative power is absorbed in the film and the spectral distribution. which are of paramount importance for applications such as near-field thermophotovoltaics.,True,vr-pFQMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,6,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4919931,11298946042969069150,/scholar?cites=11298946042969069150,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4919931,0,0,0

Using a coupled radiative. electrical and thermal model. we highlight that. without a large conductive-convective heat transfer coefficient applied to the cell. the rise in temperature of the photovoltaic cell induces dramatic efficiency losses. We then investigate solutions to mitigate thermal effects. such as radiative cooling or the decrease of the emissivity or the temperature of the radiator. Without extending the radiating area beyond that of the cell. gains by radiative cooling are marginal. However. for a given radiator temperature. decreasing its emissivity is beneficial to conversion efficiency and. in cases of limited conductive-convective cooling capacities. even leads to larger electrical power outputs.

The procedure used to build such structures is discussed. Then. thermal conductivity of various samples is studied as a function of the periodicity of regular superlattices and of the applied temperature. Preliminarily results show that for regular amorphous/crystalline superlattices. the amorphous regions control the heat transfer within the structures.

1210313,Thermal radiation at the nanoscale: near-field and interference effects in few-layer structures and on the electrical performances of thermophotovoltaic devices,2016,Etienne Blandre,,,,,,This thesis manuscript deals with the study of near-field radiation thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems. TPV systems convert thermal energy from a hot radiator into electricity in a photovoltaic cell via. The advantage of those systems compared to conventional solar PV systems is that it is possible to control the emission properties of the radiator to increase the performances of the system. One way to control the radiative heat transfer between two bodies is near-field thermal radiation. It is a regime that occurs when two bodies are separated by a distance smaller than the thermal wavelength (10 µm at 300 K). In this case. the radiative heat flux between the two bodies is significantly enhanced. and the spectrum of emission can be tuned using surface polaritons. In the far field. interference effects occurring in multilayer structures also allow controlling the thermal radiation emitted.The fundamentals of thermal radiation and photovoltaics are first reminded. Results of numerical simulations of the thermal emission of few-layer structures supporting interference phenomena are then presented. These phenomena allow tuning the spectrum of emission. and therefore make possible the optimal design of a selective emitter for TPV applications. The impact of temperature on the spectral and total hemispherical emissivities of the same type of structure is then investigated. The importance of the temperature dependence of the optical properties of the materials constituting the emitters is highlighted. It is demonstrated that the control of interferences using few-layer structures allow increasing the total hemispherical emissivity by a factor 20 compared to a single …,True,vr-pFQMAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,3,http://theses.insa-lyon.fr/publication/2016LYSEI103/these.pdf,16824586377054677943,/scholar?cites=16824586377054677943,,http://theses.insa-lyon.fr/publication/2016LYSEI103/these.pdf,0,0,0

Using electromagnetic simulations. we show that the optical properties of such structures are near-ideal. due to the large reflectivity of silver in the solar spectrum and the large emissivity of silica in the infrared. Surface texturation is key to obtain near-unity emissivity in the infrared. By using thin transparent layers sandwiched between silver layers at the bottom of the structures. resonant absorption can be obtained. leading to coloration while keeping acceptable radiative cooling power.

For the sake of aestheticism. control over coloration would be a clear added value for the automobile body or walls of a building. Since coloration decreases cooling performances because of solar absorption in the visible range. mitigating the loss in radiative cooling power requires selective narrowband absorption in the visible range. In order to make a compromise between aestheticism and energetic efficiency. we aim in this paper to obtain colored surfaces with mitigated sunlight absorption and high emission in the infrared.

However. the scaling of density functional theory calculations with number of atoms limits the usage of charge-density-based calculations and analyses. Here we introduce a machine-learning scheme with local-environment-based graphs and graph convolutional neural networks to predict charge density on grid points from the crystal structure. We show the accuracy of this scheme through a comparison of predicted charge densities as well as properties derived from the charge density. and that the scaling is O (N).

The selective-region chemical modifications of the substrates are achieved via microcontact printing combined with the elegant self-assembly of octadecyltrichlorosilane molecules on the substrates. The patternable growth method is versatile and can be used as a general strategy for growing a broad class of high-quality 2D chalcogenide crystals with tailorable configurations on a variety of chemically engineered substrates.

Unfortunately. the lithium-ion conductivities of the state-of-the-art polymer electrolytes are few orders of magnitude lower than those of liquid electrolytes at room temperature. In this work. we focus on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). which has shown the highest lithium ion conductivity in polymer electrolytes so far. At high salt concentrations. the lithium conductivity of a PEO electrolyte is strongly reduced because of the formation of ionic aggregates. Using molecular dynamics simulations and rigorously taking into account ionic correlations. we show how introducing a secondary site with a specific chemical structure in the backbone of PEO can greatly enhance the lithium conductivity of such concentrated electrolytes.

Most existing studies implicitly assume that the training data are generated through a deterministic. unbiased process. but this assumption might not hold for the simulation of some complex materials. In this work. we aim to screen amorphous polymer electrolytes which are promising candidates for the next generation lithium-ion battery technology but extremely expensive to simulate due to their structural complexity. We demonstrate that a multi-task graph neural network can learn from a large amount of noisy. biased data and a small number of unbiased data and reduce both random and systematic errors in predicting the transport properties of polymer electrolytes. This observation allows us to achieve accurate predictions on the properties of complex materials by learning to reduce errors in the training data. instead of running repetitive. expensive simulations which is conventionally used to reduce simulation errors. With this approach. we screen a space of 6247 polymer electrolytes. orders of magnitude larger than previous computational studies. We also find a good extrapolation performance to the top polymers from a larger space of 53362 polymers and 31 experimentally-realized polymers.

First. I present a neural network architecture to learn the representations of an arbitrary solid material. which encodes several fundamental symmetries for solid materials as inductive biases. Then. I extend the approach to explore four different learning problems: 1) supervised learning to predict material properties from structures; 2) visualization to understand structure-property relations; 3) unsupervised learning to understand atomic scale dynamics from time series trajectories; 4) active learning to explore an unknown material space.

In addition. the insulating M_2 phase is investigated for the first time. The density functional calculations allow for a consistent understanding of all three phases. In the rutile phase metallic conductivity is carried by metal t_2g orbitals. which fall into the one‐dimensional d_∥ band. and the isotropically dispersing e^\pi_g bands. Hybridization of both types of bands is weak. In the M_1 phase splitting of the d_∥ band due to metal‐metal dimerization and upshift of the e^\pi_g bands due to increased p‐d overlap lead to an effective separation of both types of bands.

In particular we investigate two of the most sophisticated schemes. namely the Anderson mixing and the Broyden update. both generalized to the consideration of arbitrarily many previous iterations. For the Broyden method we give a new derivation which is much simpler than that recently proposed by Vanderbilt and Louie. We show that if the additional parameters invented by these authors in order to increase flexibility are used to optimize the convergence of the iteration process they in fact cancel out. In addition we prove that in this (optimal) case the Anderson mixing and the Broyden update as applied to the inverse Jacobian are fully identical. Thus we come to the conclusion that neither of these schemes is superior.

We present results of all-electron electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory within the local density approximation and using the augmented spherical wave method. The electronic properties of MoO 2 are dominated by strong hybridization of O 2p and crystal-field-split Mo 4d states with bands near the Fermi energy originating almost exclusively from Mo 4d t 2g orbitals. In additional calculations for a hypothetical high-symmetry rutile structure these bands separate into quasi-one-dimensional d∥ states pointing along the rutile c-axis and the rather isotropically dispersing π* bands.

Both metallic rutile and insulating low-temperature NbO 2. which crystallizes in a distorted rutile structure. are correctly described within density functional theory and the local density approximation.

It is shown that force field calculations as presently parametrized are not able to reproduce the correct energetical ordering for these groups. Embedding not only gives the right ordering but also agrees well with the periodic calculations for geometries. OH stretching frequencies can be obtained in very good agreement with experiment by periodic DFT calculations in particular if anharmonic corrections are included.

Interstitial hydrogen atoms occupy preferentially tetrahedral sites. The calculations show that a single vacancy in α-Zr can trap up to nine hydrogen atoms. Self-interstitial Zr atoms attract hydrogen to a lesser extent. Accumulation of hydrogen atoms near self-interstitials may become a nucleation site for hydrides. By including the temperature-dependent terms of the free energy based on ab initio calculations. hydrogen adsorption isotherms are computed and shown to be in good agreement with experimental data. The solubility of hydrogen decreases in Zr under compressive strain. The volume dependence on hydrogen concentration is similar for hydrogen in solution and in hydrides.

UV-melting experiments. and molecular mechanics calculations. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were analyzed by means of 2-dimensional NMR experiments. J-Coupling analysis of the 1D and 2D 1H and 13C spectra was used to determine the conformation of the ring systems in the molecule. It appeared that at low temperature (283 K) the deoxyribose sugars adopt a N-type conformation. The geometry is best described by an intermediate between the 3 (2) T and 3E forms. In addition. we were able to derive all other torsion angles in the phosphate backbone ring system. ie. alpha+. beta t. gamma+. delta (= 89 degrees). epsilon t. and zeta+. When the molecule is subjected to an energy minimization procedure (using the program AMBER). the sugar ring system retains. practically speaking. the torsion angles found from the NMR experiments. while the torsion angles around the glycosidic bond adopt a value of 175 degrees in the minimum energy conformation. UV-melting experiments indicate that two molecules can form a dimer in which the adenine bases are intercalated. The feasibility of this structure is indicated by molecular mechanics calculations.

The presence of Si atomic lines is found to coincide systematically with a lateral mismatch between the c (4× 2) Si-dimer rows. Their number and spacing are mediated by annealing time and temperature. resulting in unprecedented arrangements ranging from a very large superlattice to a single isolated atomic line.,True,21tF6ewAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC,115,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.79.2498,4863020186785605331,/scholar?cites=4863020186785605331,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Mayne/publication/243473880_Highly_Stable_Si_Atomic_Line_Formation_on_the_b_-SiC100_Surface/links/00b49533e7d850a849000000/Highly-Stable-Si-Atomic-Line-Formation-on-the-b-SiC100-Surface.pdf,0,0,0
1210402,Metallization and Metal-Semiconductor Interfaces,2012,Inder P Batra,195,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,"This book represents the work presented at a NATO Advanced Research Workshop on"" Metallization and Metal-Semiconductor Interfaces"". held at the Technical University of Munich. Garching. W. Germany from 22-26 August 1988. The major focus of the workshop was to evaluate critically the progress made in the area of metal-semiconductor interfaces. The underlying theme was the mechanism of Schottky barrier formation and a serious as sessment of the various models. A significant fraction of the workshop time was also spent in discussing the interaction of alkali metals with semiconductors. Alkali metals on semi conductors form ordered overlayers and the resulting system often exhibits one-dimensional metallic properties. The nature of their interaction has introduced new and exciting com plexities and this was pursued at length during the lively discussions at the workshop. A half a day was devoted to Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. the emphasis being on its utility in providing structural and electronic character of low-coverage regime. The book should pro vide readers with the most current status of the research activity in the general area of metal-semiconductor interfaces at an international level. It should also serve as an excellent introduction to the field. since sufficient review type of material has also been included The workshop organizers.

The coverage-dependent splitting of the Cs 4d core level into two sets of doublets indicate site-dependent adsorption for submonolayer coverages up to about 0.5 monolayer (ML). The broadening of this core level close to the saturation coverage is consistent with the growth of an out of registry monolayer as suggested by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) data.

The method is cast in the form of a direct CI. makes use of Siegbahn’s external space simplifications. and is suitable for very large configuration interaction (CI) wave functions. The ethylene molecule was chosen. as a prototype of unsaturated organic molecules. for the variational study of genuine many (i.e..≳2) body correlation effects.

Specifically treated are systems for which all electrons outside closed shells have their spins parallel. Although the open‐shell formalism is somewhat complicated. its application once implemented. is not greatly more arduous than the closed‐shell theory presented in 1979 by Pople and co‐workers. Like previous procedures for the evaluation of the second derivatives of electrons repulsion integrals. the present method exploits the Rys polynomial concept.

We use a two furnace system that enables the S precursor to be separately heated from the WO3 precursor and growth substrate. Accurate control of the S introduction time enabled the formation of triangular WS2 domains with edges up to 370 μm which are visible to the naked eye. The WS2 domains exhibit room-temperature photoluminescence with a peak value around ∼635 nm and a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of ∼12 nm.

The early stage of the reaction was characterized by a defect-induced Raman peak. drastic quenching of photoluminescence (PL) signals and sub-nm protrusions in atomic force microscopy images. As the reaction proceeded from the uppermost layer to the buried layers. PL and optical second harmonic generation signals showed characteristic modulations revealing a layer-by-layer conversion.

Here. we show the effect of H2O reactant exposure on monolayer (1L) MoS2 during atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3. The results showed that the ALD-Al2O3 caused degradation of the performance of 1L MoS2 field effect transistors (FETs) owing to the formation of Mo–O bonding and trapping of H2O molecules at the Al2O3/MoS2 interface. Furthermore. we demonstrated that reduced duration of exposure to H2O reactant and postdeposition annealing were essential to the enhancement of the performance of top-gated 1L MoS2 FETs.

The ODP reaction with N2O occurred via a VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox couple. whereas both VV(d0)/VIV(d1) and VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox cycles were active with O2. O2 was a more active oxidizing agent than N2O. Peroxovanadates as precursors of vanadyl species were formed on reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxide species with O2. but not with N2O. Peroxovanadates were highly reactive for propene oxidation. The absence of peroxovanadates may explain the superior performance of N2O compared with O2 in the …,True,uOnt_0IAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,88,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951708001000,11947346179278482714,/scholar?cites=11947346179278482714,,,0,0,0

In agreement with previous studies. it is found that secondary alkoxy formation is preferred over primary alkoxy formation. Steric constraints appear not to affect the course of the reaction. Analysis of the radial distribution of the zeolitic atoms with respect to the Brønsted site aluminum atom allows further insight into the reaction. Changes in the zeolite oxygen atom position are more significant than those of the zeolite silicon atoms.

Two different scenarios proposed in the literature were tested. First a reaction including an alkyl shift was considered: a methyl or ethyl group is detached from the carbenium ion chain and reattached at another site in the residual hydrocarbon chain. However. this mechanism is rather unlikely. since the alkyl ion is a high-energy species. so its detachment from the carbenium ion induces a high activation energy. We find that the more likely pathway for skeletal isomerization inside the channels of ZSM-22 involves the rearrangement of the carbenium ion into a protonated dimethylcyclopropane and implies the formation of relatively stable secondary carbenium ions as transient intermediates.,True,uOnt_0IAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,65,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002195170200074X,3453347390198646875,/scholar?cites=3453347390198646875,,,0,0,0

The first one relies on the adoption of a parabolic trough network with an intermediate thermal carrier. while the second one considers the direct heating of the working air in a solar tower system. The first solution also includes a bottoming organic Rankine cycle (ORC) plant. so that it is mainly addressed to the power output increase. The second one involves a relevant temperature increase of the air entering the combustor. so allowing a direct fuel energy saving. whose amount is strongly variable with both the solar irradiance and the eventual part-load operation. In addition. the latter solar-assisted scheme involves noticeable variations in the conditions for the combustion development.

1210597,Accurate analysis of multicomponent spray evaporation in a turbulent flow,2010,Bastian Rauch and Raffaela Calabria and Fabio Chiariello and Patrick Le Clercq and Patrizio Massoli and Michael Rachner,,Proceedings,,,,Aim of the paper is to present results concerning numerical computations and experimental measurements of evaporating sprays of single component and binary mixtures fuels in a hot turbulent flow. To this aim an experimental system with controlled fluid dynamic was built up. The spray produced by means of a calibrated droplet generator was injected in a gas flow electrically preheated. In the present configuration. the carrier gas was air and experiments were performed at flow velocities up to 3 m/s and at the maximum inlet temperature of 800 K. N-nonane. isopropanol and their mixtures were used in the tests. The heated air flow was convoyed in a cylindrical quartz tube that allowed optical measurements. Particle Image Velocimetry was used to determine the gaseous flow fields. Generalized Scattering Imaging technique was applied to simultaneously determine size. velocity and spatial location of droplets in the spray along the quartz tube. To compute the spray evaporation the multiphase flow simulation tool SPRAYSIM and the gas phase solver ANSYS® CFX-12.0 were used. The comparison between numerical computations and experimental measurements were performed at different locations along the tubular reactor. The agreement is very fine concerning the mean diameters but especially the size distributions of droplets. Some differences were observed in the predictions of the droplets velocities. This was imputed to uncertainties in computation of the gas flow field at high temperature and also to some instability in the experimental air flow.,True,XdNX9JMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,http://ltces.dem.ist.utl.pt/LXLASER/lxlaser2010/upload/1723_qkupls_2.2.1.Full_1723.pdf,,,,http://ltces.dem.ist.utl.pt/LXLASER/lxlaser2010/upload/1723_qkupls_2.2.1.Full_1723.pdf,0,0,0

This paper investigates the combustion characteristics of Rapeseed oil and its blends with Diesel oil in swirling spray flames. It focuses on the stability of flames. NOx. CO and particle emissions. We observed that CO2 dilution decreased the NOx emission (up to 20 times) due to the lower furnace temperature at fixed oxygen concentration. Although the dilution of combustion does not produce significant effect on the shape of the size distribution functions. this modifies significantly the absolute concentrations of the emitted particles.

Thus. reliability-growth models are important. This paper proposes a nonparametric reliability-growth model which analyzes. in a Bayes-decision framework. failure data from repairable systems undergoing a test-find-test growth program. The failure process in each stage of testing is assumed to follow a power-law process which can describe the failure pattern of systems subject to wear-out degradation during test.

If the corrective actions are effective. the system reliability increase. This process can be carried out for a planned time period or until a fixed reliability goal is achieved. In both cases. it is important to evaluate the system reliability during the test phase.

For such a process. a Bayes procedure for estimating the failure intensity at the time of the last failure and of the current system reliability is analyzed for failure-truncated sampling.

The Generalized Scattering Imaging (GSI) approach for droplet sizing. based on both the Lorenz-Mie theory and the Finely Stratified Sphere Scattering Model can be applied to both homogenous droplets and inhomogeneous and/or absorbing droplets. A new system has been developed using the GSI approach. with the capability to measure the velocity and size of droplets with non-uniform and/or varying refractive index. even in regions of high particle number density. A windowed FFT based approach was used to identify the presence and location of a droplet oscillation pattern. and an optimized frequency-based algorithm was used to extract the droplet size. A twoframe tracking algorithm was devised to measure the velocity of droplets from the two consecutive image frames. The size range and droplet concentration limits were investigated using simulated out-of-focus images. A maximum measurable diameter range from 10µm to 600µm was obtained for the range of magnification and defocus recommended here. The maximum droplet concentration is expected to be about 3000#/cc. Sizing accuracy was verified using monodisperse droplets and a graded index optical fiber.

Gaseous fuels obtained through biomass conversion processes such as gasification. pyrolysis and pyrogasification are generally defined as synthesis gas (syngas). The use of synthesis gas in small-size energy systems. such as those used for distributed micro-cogeneration. has not yet reached a level of technological maturity that could allow a large market diffusion.

Inc.,The Modulated Power Law process has been recently proposed as a suitable model for describing the failure pattern of repairable systems when both renewal-type behaviour and time trend are present. Unfortunately. the maximum likelihood method provides neither accurate confidence intervals on the model parameters for small or moderate sample sizes nor predictive intervals on future observations.This paper proposes a Bayes approach. based on both non-informative and vague prior. as an alternative to the classical method. Point and interval estimation of the parameters. as well as point and interval prediction of future failure times. are given.

Canada and Europe is equipped with a three-way catalytic converter (TWC) in combination with a fuel control system in order to reduce the pollutant emissions. For the maximum TWC conversion efficiency. the engine control has to furnish a stoichiometric air fuel mixture to the cylinders. For this purpose an estimation of the air incoming into cylinders becomes necessary in every driving condition. not only in steady-state operations. but especially during rapid throttle transients.

In the last decade different devices have been proposed to implement advanced and innovative VVA managements on four-stroke engines. ElectroMechanical Valve Actuator (EMVA) formed by two opposite magnets and two balanced springs seem to be a very promising solution among several camless actuation systems.

This design philosophy. known as “engine downsizing”. allows to reduce mechanical and pumping losses at low load as a consequence of the higher operating Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP). The presence of the turbocharger allows to restore the maximum power output of the larger displacement engine. Additional advantages are a higher low-speed torque and hence a better drivability and fun-to-drive. Of course. at high loads. the spark-advance must be carefully controlled to avoid the knock occurrence and this determines a substantial penalization of the fuel consumption. The knowledge of the knock-limited spark timing is hence a key point in order to reduce the fuel consumption drop at high loads.In a previous study [1]. a combined procedure for the quasi-dimensional modeling of both …,True,YikPqdsAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,32,https://www.jstor.org/stable/26275430,16145247445419753114,/scholar?cites=16145247445419753114,,,0,0,0

Usually VVT devices are applied on intake and exhaust camshafts. in the “phased” or “unphased” configuration. as well. VVA devices are instead commonly mounted on the intake camshaft.

This actuator needs to be properly controlled to reduce impact velocities during engine valve operations. but the use of a position sensor for each valve is not possible for cost reasons.

To address this task. in this paper. we present an in-depth lumped parameter model of an EMVA based on a hybrid analytical-finite-element method (FEM) approach. The idea is to develop a model of EMVA embedding the well-known predictive behavior of FEM models.

An in-depth experimental investigation shows that the proposed control method is a viable solution as it is robust with respect to nonlinear torques acting on the plant. and it guarantees better performance than those provided by other MRAC strategies …,True,oO89bzkAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,51,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6477138/,15472281984969772985,/scholar?cites=15472281984969772985,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45060916/Robust_Discrete-Time_MRAC_With_Minimal_C20160425-14731-18kgo78.pdf,0,0,0

1210709,The renaissance,1997,Peter Burke,,,,,Macmillan International Higher Education,Annotation In this study Peter Burke distances himself from the traditional interpretation of the Renaissance as essentially Italian. self-consciously modern and easily separable from the Middle Ages. He emphasises the survival of medieval traditions and the process of the creative adaptation of classical forms and values to their new cultural and social contexts in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. The story is carried down to the seventeenth century and the diffusion and disintegration of what had once been a coherent movement.

1210715,Did Europe exist before 1700?,1980,Peter Burke,1,History of European ideas,1,21-29,Taylor & Francis Group,A discussion of the history of conceptions of Europe may appropriately begin with the reminder that the subject is not as clear or distinct as it may look. What is this entity ‘Europe’? A land-mass. but a land-mass without natural frontiers. offering plenty of room for disagreement over what territory should be included or excluded. Europe has never been an economic or political unit. whatever the future may hold. The land-mass has never had a common culture distinct from other parts of the world. Not even Christianity has ever quite filled this role. for even in the Middle Ages there were Christians outside Europe and Muslims in Andaiusia. Bosnia and elsewhere. Europe is not so much a place as an idea. Studies of this idea are not lacking: among the most important are the books by Fritzemeyer. Saitta. Gollwitzer. Fischer. Hay. Curcio.

(ii) annealing followed by hot-pressing. and (iii) quenching and annealing followed by hot-pressing. We found that the thermoelectric figure of merit. zT. strongly depends on the synthesis condition and that its value can be enhanced to ∼2.0 at 773 K by optimizing the size distribution of the nanostructures in the material. Based on our theoretical analysis on both electron and thermal transport. this zT enhancement is attributed to the reduction of both the lattice and electronic thermal conductivities; the smallest sizes (2∼6 nm) of nanostructures in the QH sample are responsible for effectively scattering the wide range of phonon wavelengths to minimize the lattice thermal conductivity to ∼0.5 W/m K.

We show that such rectifying field-effect transistors may still be treated as a lumped element device in the limit where plasma resonances of the electron gas do not occur. We derive analytic formulas for important transistor parameters. such as effective rectification length and device impedance using a transmission-line model. We draw conclusions for plasma-resonant detection where possible. We derive the THz response of a field-effect transistor with a two-dimensional electron-gas channel by a Taylor expansion of the drain–source bias. We connect circuit theory to the existing theories that describe the bias in the gated region by differential equations. Parasitic effects. such as the access resistance. are included.

1210728,Is there a Cultural History of the Emotions?,2005,Peter Burke,,"Representing emotions: New connections in the histories of art, music and medicine",,35-48,Ashgate,The idea of an interdisciplinary conference on the history of the emotions appears to have been a timely one. There was a conference on ‘Representations of Emotions’ at Konstanz in 1997 and one on ‘The Historicity of Emotions’ in Jerusalem in 1998. while the annual conference on the Renaissance at Tours chose as its theme for 2000.‘Les Larmes à la Renaissance’. 1 In sociology too the study of emotions is a relatively new field. 2 Beyond the academic world. one might note the increasing use of concepts such as ‘emotional literacy’and ‘emotional ‘intelligence’. although these terms are often used rather loosely. 3All the same. it should be recognized that this is not the first time that emotions have been put on the historian’s agenda. The idea of epochs of feeling goes back to the age of Romanticism.

1210729,The Renaissance Dialogue,1989,Peter Burke,3,Renaissance Studies,1,1-12,Wiley,This lecture is a breach of decorum in more than one respect. In the first place. it is a monologue on dialogue. I was tempted to modify the format of the annual lecture and to give the chairman a speaking part. asking him questions from time to time. In the second place. the lecture is indecorous because the dialogue is a literary genre while the speaker is no literary historian-not a specialist but a historical GP. My reason for going ahead all the same is the conviction that the dialogue is too impor tant in Renaissance culture for historians to leave to the literary critics. We cannot simply appropriate it but we ought to share it with them. to enter. indeed. into a dialogue with them. The point is that collaboration with the critics can save us. the GPs. from one of the occupational hazards of the plain historian: literal mindedness.

1210733,An InN/InGaN quantum dot electrochemical biosensor for clinical diagnosis,2013,Naveed Ul Hassan Alvi and Victor J Gómez and Paul ED Soto Rodriguez and Praveen Kumar and Saima Zaman and Magnus Willander and Richard Nötzel,13,Sensors,10,13917-13927,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Low-dimensional InN/InGaN quantum dots (QDs) are demonstrated for realizing highly sensitive and efficient potentiometric biosensors owing to their unique electronic properties. The InN QDs are biochemically functionalized. The fabricated biosensor exhibits high sensitivity of 97 mV/decade with fast output response within two seconds for the detection of cholesterol in the logarithmic concentration range of 1× 10− 6 M to 1× 10− 3 M. The selectivity and reusability of the biosensor are excellent and it shows negligible response to common interferents such as uric acid and ascorbic acid. We also compare the biosensing properties of the InN QDs with those of an InN thin film having the same surface properties. ie. high density of surface donor states. but different morphology and electronic properties. The sensitivity of the InN QDs-based biosensor is twice that of the InN thin film-based biosensor. the EMF is three times larger. and the response time is five times shorter. A bare InGaN layer does not produce a stable response. Hence. the superior biosensing properties of the InN QDs are governed by their unique surface properties together with the zero-dimensional electronic properties. Altogether. the InN QDs-based biosensor reveals great potential for clinical diagnosis applications.

The emission properties and lifetime values of CdSe quantum dots were found to be dependent on the oxidation potential of amines and crystallite sizes. Smaller CdSe quantum dots (size ∼5 nm) ensure better surface coverage of amines and hence higher quenching efficiency of amines could be realized as compared to larger CdSe quantum dots (size ∼14 nm). Heterogeneous quenching of amines due to the presence of accessible and inaccessible set of CdSe fluorophores is indicated. PPD owing to its lowest oxidation potential (∼0.26 V) has been found to have higher quenching efficiency as compared to other amines TEA and aniline having oxidation potentials ∼0.66 and >1.0 V. respectively.

The middle portion (∼5 cm) of a 15 cm long multimode fiber is etched in 48% hydrofluoric acid to reduce its diameter to ∼12 μm. A NL of diameter <1 mm is made from the etched fiber. The ends of etched fiber are spliced with single-mode fibers for launching and detecting light from the NL interferometer. The NL introduces path differences to produce interferometric spectra with free spectral range ∼16 nm. The spectrum shifts as the surrounding refractive index of the loop is changed by adding chemicals. We observe the highest sensitivity of the NL interferometer ∼172 nm/RIU (refractive index unit) at a refractive index value 1.370 as obtained experimentally using commonly available chemicals.

Soil pH is a key parameter for crop productivity therefore its spatial variation should be adequately addressed to improve precision agriculture management system. Soil pH affects the soil's physical. chemical. and biological properties and processes. and thus plant growth. Soil pH a measure of hydronium ion (H+) concentration traditionally tested in labs to decide how much fertilizer to apply to a field. Recently. with increased emphasis on precision agriculture. economics. and the environment. soil tests are also a logical tool to determine areas where adequate or excessive fertilization has taken place. In addition. they are used to monitor the impact of past fertility practices on changes in a field’s nutrient status. Therefore. developing rapid tools which can detect pH variations on a site-specific basis has become pressing need of the hour because laboratory based methods are inadequate. time consuming. laborious. and expensive.

User preferences also appear in textual content provided in forums. blogs. wikis. and the like and may represent detailed reviews or short statements expressing sentiments. In fact. sentiment analysis has shown that textual messages in microblogs correlate highly to public opinion polls. 3 Social media content can refer to possible future events. either explicitly and implicitly. but it remains unexploited in making predictions and aiding decisions about the future. The ability to predict the outcome of future events quickly and accurately is critical in today’s business environment. For example. sales predictions and sensing of future consumer behavior can help businesses alter research and production planning.One emerging method for facilitating predictions about future events is prediction markets (PMs). which are speculative markets that serve to aggregate the beliefs of multiple traders in the price of contracts representing different outcomes of a future event. Contract prices provide a reasonable estimate of what the traders in aggregate believe to be the probability of an event. and as such. markets are able to generate forecasts.

Furthermore. sequencing of multiple strains with the same host range reveals information concerning pathogen diversity and the molecular basis of virulence. Here we present a comparative analysis of draft genome sequences for four strains of Pseudomonas cannabina pathovar alisalensis (Pcal). which is pathogenic on a range of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. These draft genome sequences provide a foundation for understanding host range evolution across the monocot-dicot divide. Like other phytopathogenic pseudomonads. Pcal strains harboured a hrp/hrc gene cluster that codes for a type III secretion system. Phylogenetic analysis based on the hrp/hrc cluster genes/proteins. suggests localized recombination and functional divergence within the hrp/hrc cluster. Despite significant conservation of overall genetic content across Pcal genomes. comparison of type III effector repertoires reinforced previous molecular data suggesting the existence of two distinct lineages within this pathovar. Furthermore. all Pcal strains analyzed harbored two distinct genomic islands predicted to code for type VI secretion systems (T6SSs). While one of these systems was orthologous to known P. syringae T6SSs. the other more closely resembled a T6SS found within P. aeruginosa. In summary. our study provides a foundation to unravel Pcal adaptation to both monocot and dicot hosts and provides genetic insights into the mechanisms underlying pathogenicity.,True,nrEurAoAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,32,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059366,14917746554622237261,/scholar?cites=14917746554622237261,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059366,0,0,0

Pseudomonas corrugata (Pcor) and P. mediterranea (Pmed). are closely related species that cause pith necrosis. a disease of tomato that causes severe crop losses. However. they also show strong antagonistic effects against economically important pathogens. demonstrating their potential for utilization as biological control agents. In addition. their metabolic versatility makes them attractive for the production of commercial biomolecules and bioremediation. An extensive comparative genomics study is required to dissect the mechanisms that Pcor and Pmed employ to cause disease. prevent disease caused by other pathogens. and to mine their genomes for commercially significant chemical pathways. Here. we present the draft genomes of nine Pcor and Pmed strains from different geographical locations. This analysis covered significant genetic heterogeneity and allowed in-depth genomic comparison. All examined strains were able to trigger symptoms in tomato plants but not all induced a hypersensitive-like response in Nicotiana benthamiana. Genome-mining revealed the absence of a type III secretion system and of known type III effectors from all examined Pcor and Pmed strains. The lack of a type III secretion system appears to be unique among the plant pathogenic pseudomonads.

The PA/N interplay in plants connects N metabolism. carbon (C) fixation. and secondary metabolism pathways. Glutamate. a pivotal N-containing molecule. is responsible for the biosynthesis of proline (Pro). arginine (Arg) and ornithine (Orn) and constitutes a main common pathway for PAs and C/N assimilation/incorporation implicated in various stresses. PAs and their derivatives are important signaling molecules. as they act largely by protecting and preserving the function/structure of cells in response to stresses. Use of different research approaches. such as generation of transgenic plants with modified intracellular N and PA homeostasis. has helped to elucidate a plethora of PA roles. underpinning their function as a major player in plant stress responses. In this context. a range of transgenic plants over-or under-expressing N/PA metabolic genes has been developed in an effort to decipher their implication in stress signaling. The current review describes how N and PAs regulate plant growth and facilitate crop acclimatization to adverse environments in an attempt to further elucidate the N-PAs interplay against abiotic and biotic stresses. as well as the mechanisms controlling N-PA genes/enzymes and metabolites.

Resveratrol and related biophenols seem to be of great interest. since beyond their protective nature and contrary to sulfites they can positively affect consumer health. These bioactive phytochemicals are naturally produced in grapes as evolutionary acquired mechanisms against pathogens and UV irradiation. However. despite the efforts made so far attempting to develop economic and industrially adopted isolation techniques. available quantities of these biophenols for commercial use are still quite limited. Therefore. such molecules are still not able to meet the needs of industrial use due to their prohibitive marketable cost. In this review we summarize the efforts that have been made to biosynthesize these molecules through alternative. innovative ways. Increasing interest in modern biotechnological approaches has shed light on the exploitation of metabolically engineered microbial factories. instead of plants. to produce molecules of industrial interest. Such approaches. also reviewed here. are expected to lower the cost and appear promising to produce enough surplus to attract further oenological experimentation upon yielding functional wines.

However. little is known about the molecular evolution of this species. In this study we investigated the intraspecies genetic variation of P. viridiflava amongst local (Cretan). as well as international isolates of the pathogen. The genetic and phenotypic variability were investigated by molecular fingerprinting (rep-PCR) and partial sequencing of three housekeeping genes (gyrB. rpoD and rpoB). and by biochemical and pathogenicity profiling. The biochemical tests and pathogenicity profiling did not reveal any variability among the isolates studied. However. the molecular fingerprinting patterns and housekeeping gene sequences clearly differentiated them. In a broader phylogenetic comparison of housekeeping gene sequences deposited in GenBank. significant genetic variability at the molecular level was found between isolates of P. viridiflava originated from different host species as well as among isolates from the same host. Our results provide a basis for more comprehensive understanding of the biology. sources and shifts in genetic diversity and evolution of P. viridiflava populations and should support the development of molecular identification tools and epidemiological studies in diseases caused by this species.,True,nrEurAoAAAAJ:6VlyvFCUEfcC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/47690497/Pseudomonas_viridiflava_a_Multi_Host_Pla20160801-4988-13itsn1.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47690497/Pseudomonas_viridiflava_a_Multi_Host_Pla20160801-4988-13itsn1.pdf,0,0,0

Subsequently. in the last few years flavonoids became top stories in pharmaceutical industry. which is continually seeking for novel ways to produce safe and efficient drugs. Microbial cell cultures can act as workhorse bio-factories by offering their metabolic machinery for the benefit of optimizing the conditions and increasing the productivity of a selective flavonoid. Furthermore. metabolic engineering methodology came to reinforce what nature does best by tuning inadequacies and dead-ends of a metabolic pathway. Combinatorial biosynthesis techniques led to discovery of novel ways to produce plant natural and even unnatural flavonoids. while on top of that metabolic engineering gave the opportunity to industry to invest in synthetic biology to overcome restricted diversification and productivity issues existing so far in synthetic chemistry protocols. In this review. we present an update on rationalized approaches for the production of natural or unnatural flavonoids through biotechnology. analyzing the significance of combinatorial biosynthesis of agricultural/ pharmaceutical compounds produced in heterologous organisms.

The PA/N interplay in plants connects N metabolism. carbon (C) fixation. and secondary metabolism pathways. Glutamate. a pivotal N-containing molecule. is responsible for the biosynthesis of proline (Pro). arginine (Arg) and ornithine (Orn) and constitutes a main common pathway for PAs and C/N assimilation/incorporation implicated in various stresses. PAs and their derivatives are important signaling molecules. as they act largely by protecting and preserving the function/structure of cells in response to stresses. Use of different research approaches. such as generation of transgenic plants with modified intracellular N and PA homeostasis. has helped to elucidate a plethora of PA roles. underpinning their function as a major player in plant stress responses. In this context. a range of transgenic plants over-or under-expressing N/PA metabolic genes has been developed in an effort to decipher their implication in stress signaling. The current review describes how N and PAs regulate plant growth and facilitate crop acclimatization to adverse environments in an attempt to further elucidate the N-PAs interplay against abiotic and biotic stresses. as well as the mechanisms controlling N-PA genes/enzymes and metabolites.

Their behaviour may affect energy use just as the systems and materials may do. Researchers identified and highlighted various aspects of this occupant behaviour and were gradually led to the conclusion that its effect might be worth investigating. This study has a twofold aim. First. to present a general conceptual framework to define. monitor and eventually change user behaviour in buildings. This framework is called “event-driven”; events are distinct moments in time associated with a potentially problematic behaviour. and the framework aims at tracking. acting upon and reporting on these events.

Therefore in several cases. shell retrofit is more appealing and approachable. This article presents a technique that was developed and validated in the field. during the RESSEEPE project (FP7). The technique allows the estimation of the U value change of a retrofitted shell element and directly link’s this change to the factual retrofit impact. The method is based on remote. real time. infrared scanning of just one surface temperature of the element before and after the retrofit. Apart from the element’s surface temperatures. both the indoor as well as the outdoor temperature are also required. The method is very easily and remotely set up. is completely non-intrusive. while its’ cost efficient leasing model makes it quite promising. Thereupon the purpose of this study is to present a reliable. objective and cost effective assessment of a shell element retrofit impact by measuring the U value changes.

1210961,Application of seismic methods for geotechnical site characterization,2005,PM Soupios and CB Papazachos and G Vargemezis and I Fikos,,International workshop in geoenvironment and geotechnics,,163-70,,There is an increasing requirement for geophysical surveys carried out during geotechnical investigations to provide direct information about rock quality or other geotechnical parameters. With the paucity of information to correlate geophysical results with actual rock properties. this is still difficult to achieve and additional research effort needs to be performed to address this issue. Nowadays. several researchers have been described detailed studies which designed specifically to investigate this matter. Generally. geophysical techniques which are used to estimate seismic velocities in the subsurface focus on the low strain levels that are not large enough to induce significant nonlinear. nonelastic stress-strain behavior (Luna and Jadi. 2000). which is normally evaluated when addressing liquefaction potential of soils in the shallow subsurface. Soil parameters relevant to seismic ground response (Rechtien. 1996) are density. relative density and void ratio. permeability. shear modulus. water saturation. soil fabric and stress history. Detailed characterization of elastic properties near a major construction site (eg a bridge) is useful for near field dynamic analysis of soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects.

Nova Publishers, USA",,,,Groundwater (GW) is one of the most valuable natural resources and for that reason. the GW protection and management is vital for human evolution. socio-economic development and ecological diversity. During the last decades. the continuously increasing need of water has led to a rapidly growing awareness in the field of GW management. At the same time over exploitation and pollution of water resources are threatening the ecosystems. The combination of these two problems which have acquired worldwide dimensions has forced many scientists working in relative fields to search new. multidisciplinary approaches to address them. Effective management and protection of groundwater resources require detail knowledge and quantitative/qualitative characterization of aquifers. Thus. modeling and planning of the GW through the use of modern technologies and approaches have become of high priority towards this direction.Despite advances in modeling tools and geoenvironmental and chemical methods. aquifer characterization remains an extremely difficult problem due to spatial heterogeneity. temporal variability and coupling between chemical. physical. and biological processes. Solution to this problem involves multidimensional data integration. The concept of data fusion involves the merging of multiple data types to develop more reliable predictive models and to address basic and applied science questions concerning GW modeling.

In order to study the physical mechanisms of such precursory signals. laboratory experiments of uniaxial compression were carried out. More specifically the behaviour of stressed marble samples from Penteli Mountain was investigated. The samples were subjected to a time-varying uniaxial compression at both variable and constant stress rates. During the first set of experiments weak electric currents were detected during pressure variations. Such Piezo Stimulated Currents (PSC) were detected while stress steps. both positive and negative were applied. the maximum stress never being greater than the elasticity limit. During the second set of experiments stress was applied at a constant rate starting from zero-stress and ending in fracture. In the region beyond the elastic limit a PSC was detected which after reaching a peak suffered a reversal in its polarity just before fracture. In a third set of experiments the same procedure was applied to previously structurally damaged samples taking care not to fracture them. In all cases the PSC followed the variation of stress and moreover it was observed that a linear relationship existed between the PSC maxima and the corresponding stress-rate maxima.

Several serious problems in the study of MG are pointed out. such as: 1. The probability of a prediction's being successful by chance should be approximately considered as the product of three probabilities. PT.

Inasmuch as the seismogenic zone comprises a rock volume filled with cracks. massive pre-seismic crack propagation may produce macroscopic electrical earthquake precursors by the superposition of the electric fields of propagating cracks. varying proportionally to the changes in dislocation/crack density and rock resistivity. The motion of dislocations occurs parallel to the applied shear stress. generating a dipole electric field parallel to their slip vector. hence quasi-parallel to the slip vector of shear cracks and by the self-similarity of fragmentation processes. to the slip vector of the upcoming earthquake. We simulate the evolution of crack populations using an ad hoc kinetic theory based on Maxwell-Boltzman statistics. Our results indicate that crack propagation evolves according to a limited class of time functions with characteristic bay and bell-like shapes. This allows for the generation of a limited class of electric precursors with analogous shape and duration varying from a few tens of seconds to a few hours. Massive crack propagation is only expected to appear at the last several hours to several days prior to rupture. defining the scale of the time lag between the precursor and the earthquake.

With many islands suffering in terms of limited and costly energy supply due to their remote location. providing a self-sustainable energy system is of utmost importance for these communities. In order to improve upon the status quo. novel solutions and projects aimed at increasing sustainability not only have to consider optimal utilization of renewable energy potentials in accordance with local conditions. but also must include active community participation. This paper analyzes both of these aspects for island communities and brings them together in an optimization scenario that is utilized to determine the relationship between supposed demand flexibility levels and achievable savings in a setting with variable renewable generation. The results. specifically discussed for a use case with real-world data for the La Graciosa island in Spain. show that boosting community participation and thus unlocking crucial demand flexibility. can be used as a powerful tool to augment novel generation technologies with savings from flexibility at around 7.5% of what is achieved purely by renewable sources.,True,U8DVU5wAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/13/3386,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/13/3386/pdf,0,0,0

Knowledge Asset Management presents a knowledge asset-centric approach which fuses the previous two approaches together. It provides a conceptual framework to guide managers in the planning and development of the initiative and presents a methodology for organisations to: define and document their knowledge management strategy.-audit and design business processes that enhance and facilitate corporate learning.-facilitate knowledge sharing between people in the organisation.-measure and evaluate the quality and value of the organisation's intellectual capital.

User preferences also appear in textual content provided in forums. blogs. wikis. and the like and may represent detailed reviews or short statements expressing sentiments. In fact. sentiment analysis has shown that textual messages in microblogs correlate highly to public opinion polls. 3 Social media content can refer to possible future events. either explicitly and implicitly. but it remains unexploited in making predictions and aiding decisions about the future. The ability to predict the outcome of future events quickly and accurately is critical in today’s business environment. For example. sales predictions and sensing of future consumer behavior can help businesses alter research and production planning.One emerging method for facilitating predictions about future events is prediction markets (PMs). which are speculative markets that serve to aggregate the beliefs of multiple traders in the price of contracts representing different outcomes of a future event. Contract prices provide a reasonable estimate of what the traders in aggregate believe to be the probability of an event. and as such. markets are able to generate forecasts.

Fire is a threat to many peat-rich biomes and has the potential to disturb these carbon stocks. Peat fires are dominated by smouldering combustion. which is ignited more readily than flaming combustion and can persist in wet conditions. In undisturbed peatlands. most of the peat carbon stock typically is protected from smouldering. and resistance to fire has led to a build-up of peat carbon storage in boreal and tropical regions over long timescales. But drying as a result of climate change and human activity lowers the water table in peatlands and increases the frequency and extent of peat fires.

1211190,Smouldering combustion phenomena in science and technology,2009,Guillermo Rein,1,International Review of Chemical Engineering,,3-18,Praise Worthy Prize,Smouldering is the slow. low-temperature. flameless form of combustion of a condensed fuel. It poses safety and environmental hazards and allows novel technological application but its fundamentals remain mostly unknown to the scientific community. The terms filtering combustion. smoking problem. deep seated fires. hidden fires. peat or peatlands fires. lagging fires. low oxygen combustion. in-situ combustion. fireflood and underground gasification. all refer to smouldering combustion phenomena. This paper attempts to synthesize a comprehensive view of smouldering combustion bringing together contributions from diverse scientific disciplines. Smouldering is the leading cause of deaths in residential fires and a source of safety concerns in space and commercial flights. Smouldering wildfires destroy large amounts of biomass and cause great damage to the soil. contributing significantly to atmospheric pollutant and green house gas emissions. Subsurface fires in coal mines and seams burn for very long periods of time. making them the oldest continuously burning fires on Earth. Worthy of consideration are the novel environmental and energy technologies being developed based on the direct application of smouldering combustion. These include the remediation of contaminated soils. production of biochar for long term storage of carbon. enchanted oil extraction from reservoirs and gasification of coal seams. The prospect of new opportunities for science and engineering in smouldering combustion are noticeable. but a much larger international research effort is required to increase the number of multidisciplinary experimental. theoretical …,True,OXHq05UAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,246,https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/2678,462848185461533239,/scholar?cites=462848185461533239,,https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/2678/Rein_SmoulderingReview_IRECHE09.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Sensor data is associated to detection and alarm and to some minor extent as a source of very basic information for building management or emergency response. The streams of data emerging from sensors are deemed to lead to a rapid information overload. so the pervasive sensor deployment (now common in modern buildings) is entirely independent of procedures associated to emergency management. Fire modelling follows a similar path because model output is not robust enough. not fast enough and the information generated by such simulations rapidly escalates in quantity and complexity so that no commander can assimilate it.

Carbon-rich soils are reactive porous materials. prone to smouldering combustion if the inert and moisture contents are low enough. An example of soil combustion happens in peatlands. where smouldering wildfires are common in both boreal and tropical regions. This work focuses on understanding soil ignition by self-heating. which is due to spontaneous exothermic reactions in the presence of oxygen under certain thermal conditions. We investigate the effect of soil inorganic content by creating under controlled conditions soil samples with inorganic content (IC) ranging from 3% to 86% of dry weight: we use sand as a surrogate of inorganic matter and peat as a surrogate of organic matter.

The increasing risk of explosion in the gas-phase and self-ignition in the solid-phase for an oxygen enhanced combustion environment has not been well studied yet. In this work. the heterogeneous reactions of a bituminous coal dust are investigated by using a novel hot-basket apparatus with an emphasis on the roles of O2 and diluent gas in chemisorption and smoldering. Experiments show that increasing O2 mole fraction accelerates both self-ignition and the following smoldering combustion.

Correlations between the flame length and the fuel mass-loss rate have revealed a delayed transition to turbulence for flames residing on the underside of fuel samples. and an earlier transition to turbulence for flames on the topside of these samples. compared to traditional vertical wall flames. As the fuel inclination increases. the relationship between the flame length and fuel mass-loss rate ranges between a recent theoretical prediction for a laminar wall plume dominated by diffusion and the traditional prediction for a turbulent wall plume dominated by convective mixing. The buoyancy-induced flow field. characterized by the flame tilt angle is shown to correspond to previously-found modifications of heat-flux profiles ahead of the flame front. which control flame spread. and the heat flux to the burning surface of the fuel. which controls fuel mass-loss rates.

Phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials use band-gap engineering to forbid certain frequencies from propagating through a material. However. existing solutions are limited in the low-frequency regimes and in their bandwidth of operation because they require impractical sizes and masses. Here. we present a class of materials (labeled elastic metastructures) that supports the formation of wide and low-frequency band gaps. while simultaneously reducing their global mass. To achieve these properties. the metastructures combine local resonances with structural modes of a periodic architected lattice.

Especially. face detection is an important part of face recognition as the first step of automatic face recognition. However. face detection is not straightforward because it has lots of variations of image appearance. such as pose variation (front. non-front). occlusion. image orientation. illuminating condition and facial expression.Many novel methods have been proposed to resolve each variation listed above. For example. the template-matching methods [1].[2] are used for face localization and detection by computing the correlation of an input image to a standard face pattern. The feature invariant approaches are used for feature detection [3].[4] of eyes. mouth. ears. nose. etc. The appearance-based methods are used for face detection with eigenface [5].[6].[7]. neural network [8].[9]. and information theoretical approach [10].[11]. Nevertheless. implementing the methods altogether is still a great challenge. Fortunately. the images used in this project have some degree of uniformity thus the detection algorithm can be simpler: first. the all the faces are vertical and have frontal view; second. they are under almost the same illuminate condition.

The frequency and size of these fires are expected to increase globally due to climate change. land use. and population movement. posing a significant threat to populations living at the wildland urban interface (WUI). as well as to habitats and the environment. Wildfires can be broadly divided into two types. smouldering (heterogeneous combustion) and flaming (homogeneous combustion). Both are important in wildfires and despite being characteristically different. one can lead to the other. The smouldering-to-flaming (STF) transition is considered threatening because it represents a sudden increase in spread rate. power. and hazard. STF transition is a sudden initiation of homogeneous gas-phase ignition preceded by smouldering combustion. and needs sufficient oxygen supply. thermal energy production. and pyrolysis products. Its unpredictable occurrence. temporally and spatially. poses an additional challenge in wildfire prevention and mitigation. For example. flaming fire may reignite through the STF transition of an undetected smouldering fire. or the transition from ember. The current understanding of the mechanisms leading to the transition is poor. Strong oxidation of char is a plausible mechanism due to its high exothermicity. acting both as heat source in driving gaseous fuel production and ignition source of the gaseous fuel. Broadly. the literature has identified two variables that govern the STF transition. i.e. oxygen supply and heat flux. on samples ranging from 0.1 to 1.22 m. Airflow velocity has competing effects.

The ignition and spread of peat fires are strongly affected by moisture. which acts as an energy sink. However. moisture effects on peat fire emissions are poorly understood in the literature. Here we present the first experimental work to investigate transient gas and particle emissions for a wide range of peat moisture contents (MCs). We include drying. ignition. smouldering spread. and even flaming stages. Peat samples conditioned to different MCs were burnt in the laboratory where a suite of diagnostics simultaneously measured mass loss rate. temperature profiles. real-time concentration of 20 gas species. and size-fractioned particle mass.

Fundamental understanding of smouldering fire spread is essential for the development of mitigating technologies.

Smouldering is a form of combustion causing long-lasting fires in natural fuels. such as coal deposits and peatlands. that is persistent despite firefighting measures and extensive rains. Once an organic soil is ignited either by flames or lightning strike. smouldering fires can be sustained for months. and spread over both the surface and deep layers of peat. Smouldering fires in organic soils. especially peat. have received increased attention from the geoscience community in recent years due to the extensive scale of ecosystem damage. pollution and climate effects.Smouldering fires in organic soils consume a massive amount of mass due to their persistent nature and the possible spread deep into the soil. Davies et al.(2013) surveyed an afforested peatland in the Scottish Highlands after a severe wildfire during the summer of 2006. Fires continued for more than a month and engulfed an area of 4.1 ha. The reported value of organic matter consumption was 773±120 t. Recent experiments showed that the carbon emission rate from organic soil fires is~ 200 t day–1 ha–1 (Huang and Rein 2017).

However. the open circuit self-heating ignition has received little attention and seems to be misunderstood in the literature.

Different flame spread behaviors were observed depending on the sample width. For wider slabs (width ≥ 10 cm). the flame spread was width-independent. The total burning rate decreased with the streamwise location to the −0.45 power. which was very close to that predicted by the laminar boundary layer theory. For narrower slabs (2.5 and 3 cm). the flame length and flame spread rate decreased with the width. The total burning rate was nearly constant along the streamwise direction. suggesting that turbulence set in at some point. It was found that width effects changed from heat and fuel loss-dominated to air entrainment-dominated as the flame grew.

In the extinction limits (non-linear) region below 25 kPa. the oxygen partial pressure is low with a small Da number. Consequently. the flame spread is gas phase kinetics controlled. resulting in low burning rate. low radiative heat loss and weak buoyancy. and thus the FSR is more sensitive to the oxygen concentration while less sensitive to the ambient pressure.

LIB fires pose hazards which are significantly different to other fire hazards in terms of initiation route. rate of spread. duration. toxicity. and suppression. For the first time. this paper collects and analyses the safety challenges faced by LIB industries across sectors. and compares them to the research contributions found in all the review papers in the field. The comparison identifies knowledge gaps and opportunities going forward. Industry and research efforts agree on the importance of understanding thermal runaway at the component and cell scales. and on the importance of developing prevention technologies.

In this study. the horizontal orientation method was analyzed. Effects of convection were studied and compared when using both the vertical and the horizontal orientation transient hot disk methods to measure the thermal conductivities of liquids. The temperature field and the velocity field of the testing fluid in both methods were obtained when numerical simulations were utilized to get quantified results of convection effects. Moreover. experiments were executed to validate the numerical simulation settings. The velocity magnitude and the Rayleigh number distribution were monitored in the direction which was perpendicular to the sensor face.

For safety. polymer flammability is most commonly reduced through flame retardants that are designed to primarily act chemically as opposed to physically. Here. we investigate computationally using the code Gpyro how inert additives such as hollow glass spheres (HGS) and boron nitride platelets (BNP) alter the flammability properties of glass fibre reinforced polybutylene terephthalate (PBT-GF). in a cone heater and UL94 setup. The Gpyro model is first validated against experiments and another code. both from the literature. for pure PBT-GF. According to the predictions.

Therefore. it is essential to have substantial knowledge of the behavior of wood undergoing external heating such as in a fire. The majority of studies in the literature use constant irradiation. Although this assumption simplifies both modelling and experimental endeavors. it is important to assess the behavior of materials under more comprehensive heating scenarios which might challenge the validity of solid-phase ignition criteria developed previously. These criteria are evaluated here for the spontaneous ignition under transient irradiation by combining experimental measurements and a-priori predictions from a model of heat transfer and pyrolysis.

Regulations restrict the height of these buildings due to safety concerns as their fire behaviour is poorly understood. The fire behaviour and loss of loadbearing capacity of timber is controlled by charring. whose chemical kinetics has rarely been studied. Current models of charring assume. without proof. the same reaction scheme and kinetic parameters apply to all wood species. which potentially introduces a large uncertainty. Here. the hypothesis is tested that the kinetics of different wood species insignificantly affects their charring behaviour. The kinetics is modelled by a microscale kinetic model—including pyrolysis and char oxidation reactions—which assumes that the three main components (cellulose. hemicellulose. and lignin) of wood degrade independently.

In a fire. timber—a natural polymer—degrades in the thermochemical process of charring. causing it to lose structural strength. In spite of significant research on the physics of charring. the chemical kinetics—reactions and kinetic parameters for pyrolysis and oxidation—remains a scientific challenge to model accurately. Current kinetic models are either computationally too expensive or neglect key chemical pathways. Here we derive a new appropriate kinetic model for fire science at the microscale using a novel methodology.

1211360,The role of heat transfer limitations in polymer pyrolysis at the microscale,2018,Franz Richter and Guillermo Rein,4,Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering,,18,Frontiers,Thermal degradation of synthetic and natural polymers is an important process in many fields of engineering such as fire safety. thermal recycling. and biomass power generation. The kinetics of thermal degradation is usually studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). which is based on measuring the mass loss rate of a microscale sample and the temperature of the surrounding fluid during controlled heating. The literature is rich in TGA measurements. which are commonly assumed to be governed solely by kinetics. Heat and mass transfer effects. however. can occur when the sample is insufficiently small in size. Only a few studies quantify a threshold for this maximum size. These thresholds vary due to different input parameters and formulations of the used model. Here. we aim to systematically analyse the role of heat transfer in TGA experiments. quantify the uncertainty of current models. and provide a novel threshold for maximum sample size. We focused on the natural polymer cellulose. a surrogate for biomass. and split the problem into heat transfer within the sample (intraparticle) and between the sample and the fluid (interparticle). Using dimensional analysis we derived two upper bound thresholds for the initial sample mass as a function of heating rate above these thresholds heat transfer effects are significant. One threshold is calculated based on interparticle heat transfer and depends on flow conditions. material and fluid properties. The other is calculated based on intraparticle heat transfer and only depends on material properties. Both thresholds were validated with experiments and previous studies from the literature.

Understanding each stage is crucial to tackle wildfires and assess the fire safety of timber buildings. A model of appropriate complexity of wood pyrolysis and oxidation is missing. which limits the understanding of fires fuelled by wood.

The construction of buildings made of timber—tall ones in particular—naturally poses questions regarding fire safety due to timber being perceived as having a low resistance to fire. However. every construction material has its risks in a fire and knowledge-based design can reduce such risks to a reasonable level.When a structural element made of timber is heated. it develops a black char layer that slowly propagates through the element. This char layer increases thermal resistance. due to lower thermal diffusivity between the fire and timber. In other words. it slows down the degradation of timber by slowing down the heating process. When assessing the structural fire resistance of timber elements. it is typically assumed that the char layer does not have any residual strength. while the layer of intact timber underneath maintains all of its strength. Therefore. the strength of a timber section can be calculated when the rate of charring has been determined. This method is called the reduced cross-section method. 2,True,K-Ajl94AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,2,https://www.sfpe.org/page/FPEExtraIssue28?&_zs=6u3de1&_zl=rmom4,2109741181531906605,/scholar?cites=2109741181531906605,,https://www.sfpe.org/page/FPEExtraIssue28?&_zs=6u3de1&_zl=rmom4,0,0,0

However. insufficient knowledge of the fire performance of timber hinders its uptake. The structural performance of timber in a fire is evaluated by the char depth after standardised heating inside a furnace. This standardised heating only represents fires in small compartments (floor area<100 m2). In larger compartments. char depths under uniform fires have been studied sparsely (area < 500 m2) and under non-uniform fires not at all (area>500 m2). This thesis aims to understand the charring behaviour of wood under uniform and non-uniform fires. To this end. a novel charring model of timber was developed across scales. At the microscale. a novel kinetic model reproduces over 80 experiments from the literature accurately. The model was developed using novel methodologies to arrive at an appropriate reaction scheme and identify experiments free of heat and mass transfer effects. At the mesoscale. this kinetic model is coupled with a heat and mass transfer model. The combined model reproduces blindly experiments under a wide range of conditions. With this model. I unified the three existing theories on the role of chemical kinetics. Furthermore. I demonstrate that chemical kinetics is key to reproduce transient charring behaviour. but that the variability in charring rates of different softwoods stems from their difference in material properties. At the macroscale. I predict that in non-uniform fires char depths are up to 34 % smaller than in uniform fires. but the strength loss ahead of the char front can be up to 129 …,True,K-Ajl94AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,1,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/79464,16836765609766433389,/scholar?cites=16836765609766433389,,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/79464/1/Richter-F-2019-PhD-Thesis.pdf,0,0,0

En otras palabras. ralentiza la degradación de la madera disminuyendo la velocidad del proceso de calentamiento. Al evaluar la resistencia al fuego de la estructura hecha con elementos de madera. generalmente se asume que la capa de residuo carbonoso no tiene ninguna resistencia residual. mientras que la capa de madera intacta que está debajo mantiene toda su resistencia.

1211373,Can we predict the charring rate? Opportunities and Challenges in Computational Pyrolysis of Timber,,Franz Richter and Guillermo Rein,,Book of abstracts of COST FP 1404 MC and WG,,13,,The fire behaviour of timber is controlled by charring. The heat of a fire causes the timber to break down (charring) into insulating char and flammable volatiles. absorbing heat in the process [1]. The volatiles diffuse to the surface. where they ignite and release heat. This heat causes the char layer to propagate into the timber until an equilibrium. between heat release and absorption. is reached. Thin beams burn quickly through. but in thick beams a layer of intact timber below the char is retained. If the intact timber still holds the structure after a fire. the structure is deemed safe.Charring is a complex process as it involves: pyrolysis. oxidation. cracking. and multiphase heat transfer. To model all process involved would create a model so complex. it would be impossible to solve. Current models in the Eurocode are. therefore. simple empirical expression like the constant charring rate [2]. These correlation were derived in furnace under a standard fire exposure [3]. making the results unusable for other heating conditions [4. 5].

Fires consume huge quantities of biomass in all ecosystems and play an important role in biogeochemical cycles. This means that understanding the influence of O2 on past fire activity has far-reaching consequences for the evolution of life and Earth’s biodiversity over geological timescales. We have used a strong electrical ignition source to ignite smoldering fires. and we measured their self-sustaining propagation in atmospheres of different oxygen concentrations. These data have been used to build a model that we use to estimate the baseline intrinsic flammability of Earth’s ecosystems according to variations in O2 over the past 350 million years (Ma).

This common mechanism of wildland fire propagation can result in rapid spread of the fire. potentially causing property damage and increased risk to life safety of both fire fighters and civilians. Despite the increasing frequency and losses in wildland fires. there has been relatively little research on ignition of fuel beds by embers and hot particles. In this work. an experimental and theoretical study of ignition of homogeneous cellulose fuel beds by hot metal particles is undertaken. This type of well-characterized laboratory fuel provides a more controllable fuel bed than natural fuels. and the use of hot metal particles simplifies interpretation of the experiments by reducing uncertainty due to unknown effects of the ember combustion reaction.

In this paper. we use an experimental methodology to study the smouldering combustion of samples of peat under a wide range burning conditions. Vertical samples (30 mm deep and 125 mm in diameter) are ignited by radiation on the top free surface and the smouldering front propagates downward against a forced flow of oxidizer. By varying the oxygen concentration ([O2]) and the ignition conditions we investigate the competing pyrolysis and oxidation reactions. A reaction framework with two regimes is consistently observed.

Because polymeric materials are flammable and ubiquitous in the modern environment. the understanding of polymer pyrolysis is thus essential to tackle accidental fires. In this paper. we used transient irradiation as an external source of heat to study the process of pyrolysis and ignition of a polymer. While previous ignition studies use constant irradiation. transient irradiation is the most frequent condition found in accidental fires. but it lacks a theoretical framework since it has been ignored in the literature. Moreover. transient irradiation is a more comprehensive case for the understanding of pyrolysis where nonlinear heat transfer effects challenge the validity of solid-phase criteria for piloted ignition developed previously.

A key factor preventing widespread uptake of these materials is the uncertainty regarding their performance in fire. Currently. the predominant approach to quantifying the structural fire resistance of timber elements is the charring rate. which allows estimation of residual cross-section and hence strength. The charring rate is usually determined by testing timber specimens in a furnace by exposure to a ‘standard fire’. However. it is recognized that the resulting charring rates are not necessarily appropriate for non-standard fire exposures or for characterizing the structural response in a real timber building.The effect of heating rate on the charring rate of CLT samples is investigated. The charring rate resulting from three heating scenarios (constant. simulated ‘standard fire’and quadratically increasing) was calculated using interpolation of in-depth temperature measurements during exposure to heating from a mobile array of radiant panels. or in a Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA). Charring rate is shown to vary both spatially and temporally. and as a function of heating rate within the range 0.36–0.79 mm/min. The charring rate for tests carried out under simulated ‘standard fire’exposures were shown to agree with the available literature. thus partially verifying the new testing approach; however under other heating scenarios the Eurocode charring rate guidance was found to be unconservative for some of the heat flux exposures in this study.

Models suggest that a substantial amount of thermal radiation was delivered to the Earth’s surface by the impact. leading to the suggestion that it was capable of igniting extensive wildfires and contributed to the end-Cretaceous extinctions. We have reproduced in the laboratory the most intense impact-induced heat fluxes estimated to have reached different points on the Earth’s surface using a fire propagation apparatus and investigated the ignition potential of forest fuels. The experiments indicate that dry litter can ignite. but live fuels typically do not. suggesting that any ignition caused by impact-induced thermal radiation would have been strongly regional dependent. The intense. but short-lived. pulse downrange and at proximal and intermediate distances from the impact is insufficient to ignite live fuel.

It simulates new generation capacities and connections to other networks using generators with quadratic cost functions. The coefficients of the cost functions express allocation preferences over connection points. The relation between capacity and subtransient reactance of generators is used during the estimation of fault currents. An iterative process allocates new capacity using optimal power flow mechanisms and readjusts capacity to bring fault currents within the specifications of switchgear. The method was tested on a 12-bus LV meshed network with three connection points for new capacity and one connection to an HV network.

However. the unbundling requirements of European Directive 2003/54/EC. coupled with traditional network planning approaches adopted by European Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). appear to be hindering development of DG and its deployment for distribution network ancillary services. The incentives – or otherwise – that arise from alternative models of DG ownership by bundled and unbundled distribution utilities are examined here.

One means of allowing further capacity penetration is to control voltage regulation devices such as on-load tap changers in a coordinated manner considering the variability of demand and generation. This approach. however. requires the deployment of communication systems. making it a potentially expensive option. To date. most DG technologies feature capabilities such as provision of reactive power or power factor control. Nonetheless. the “fit and forget” approach for the connection of DG units to distribution networks neglects a more active. decentralised management where those and other capabilities could be used without the need of further infrastructure.

Although tides are periodic and predictable. there are times when the current velocity is too low for any power generation.

In this work. a two-dimensional multi-layer cellular automaton has been developed to study the process of smouldering and the roles of both the ignition location and the direction of airflow for generic biomass. Three different configurations are studied: line front. with forward and opposed airflow respectively. and radial front. The first two configurations simulate ignition of one edge of the sample. while the radial front simulates ignition of a spot at the centre of the sample.

1211436,Influence of particle size and density on the hot surface ignition of solid fuel layers,2019,Nieves Fernandez-Anez and Javier Garcia-Torrent,55,Fire Technology,1,175-191,Springer US,Dust layers are present in every industrial facility where solid materials are generated or processed. The emergence of new fuels with still unknown flammability properties generates an increase on the risks related with these facilities that needs to be further studied. Most of these biomasses are susceptible to exothermically react. acting as an ignition source and causing fires and explosions. One of the most common causes of explosions is the ignition of dust layers deposited on the equipment. which could be avoided by a better understanding of the materials. However. the ignitability of these layers depend on several parameters as the particle size and the density of the deposited materials.

Biomass and coal present significant differences in terms of both chemical composition and physical properties. Biomass usually has an increased thermal sensitivity and a greater ease of ignition. Also. biomass particles commonly have more irregular shapes and larger sizes than pulverized coal. thus it is necessary to establish the parameters of these materials to avoid the self-combustion tendency.In the same way than coal. biomass stored are potentially able to absorb oxygen to produce exothermic oxidation reactions. If the generated heat in these reactions is not properly dispersed. causes a self-heating of the organic matter that can cause breakdown and ignition. In the field of possible self-combustion in the storage and handling of the biomass there are several factors which have influence in biomass thermal susceptibility. ie its tendency to oxidation and subsequent ignition of the substance.

These were the questions we asked ourselves at the beginning of the eight week Lloyd’s Register Foundation Collegium. A key point of leverage seems to be the growing demographic sector of the urban poor. who are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Improving the resilience of this sector is an investment that benefits the whole city. The challenge for city planners is to balance the people’s needs for an improved quality of life with the planetary needs for a light ecological footprint. Background research points to the need for a systems approach to planning that engages both private and public sector in the shaping of a vision for Eco-cities. What is lacking is the process and vocabulary to articulate the project values that will determine the course of action for a project. We have developed a decision support tool that correlates project values with sustainability improvement activities. An index matrix was selected for the accessibility for the user and the data transparency. The initial correlation data was developed by the research team. and statistically analysed to identify the matrix variables which needed to be better defined in order to normalize the data. The tool was tested with a case study application of the Weston Towers housing. in Southampton.

Each cell inside the pack is represented by a pseudo 2D electrochemical model coupled with a lumped thermal model. Increasing the number of cells in parallel results in a linear increase in load non-uniformity. whilst increasing the ratio of interconnect to battery impedance results in a logarithmic increase in load non-uniformity. with cells closest to the load points experiencing the largest currents.

In this paper we discuss the design and construction of a 9 kWh battery pack for a motorsports application. The pack contained 504 lithium cells arranged into 2 sidepods. each containing 3 modules. with each module in a 12P7S configuration. This paper focuses particularly on testing the full battery pack and diagnosing subsequent problems related to cells being connected in parallel. We demonstrate how a full vehicle test can be used to identify malfunctioning strings of cells for further investigation.

Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are currently capable of sustained and continuous operation on high‐purity fuels. but they must demonstrate that they can overcome a number of challenges before they are commercially viable on a large scale. Fuels such as natural gas. and those derived from renewable sources such as gasified biomass. contain many contaminants. typically sulfur‐ and carbon‐containing compounds.

We explain this as an extension of current theory. such that the rate determining step in both cases is the formation of a hydrogen bonded water-OHads network. strongly …,True,d7joiQQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,48,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2008/cp/b802816h,18043692624512855040,/scholar?cites=18043692624512855040,,"https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/10056/8/Kucernak,%20A%20-%20The%20role%20of%20absorbed%20hydroxyl%20species.pdf",0,0,0
1211477,Modelling transport-limited discharge capacity of lithium-sulfur cells,2016,Teng Zhang and Monica Marinescu and Sylwia Walus and Gregory J Offer,219,Electrochimica acta,,502-508,Pergamon,Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery could bring a step-change in battery technology with a potential specific energy density of 500 - 600 Wh/kg. A key challenge for further improving the specific energy-density of Li-S cells is to understand the mechanisms behind reduced sulfur utilisation at low electrolyte loadings and high discharge currents. While several Li-S models have been developed to explore the discharge mechanisms of Li-S cells. they so far fail to capture the discharge profiles at high currents. In this study. we propose that the slow ionic transport in concentrated electrolyte is limiting the rate capability of Li-S cells. This transport-limitation mechanism is demonstrated through a one-dimensional Li-S model which qualitatively captures the discharge capacities of a sulfolane-based Li-S cell at different currents. Furthermore. our model predicts that a discharged Li-S cell is able regain some capacity with a short …,True,d7joiQQAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C,44,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468616321193,11402026130646907769,/scholar?cites=11402026130646907769,,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/42404/2/Modeling%20transport%20limited%20dischage%20capacity%20of%20LiS%20cells%20unformatted.pdf,0,0,0

Intended as a text for advanced undergraduates and as a reference for practicing engineers. the book uses the physics of flows in porous materials to tie together a wide variety of important issues from such fields as biomedical engineering. energy conversion. civil engineering. electronics. chemical engineering. and environmental engineering. Thus. for example. flows of water and oil through porous ground play a central role in energy exploration and recovery (oil wells. geothermal fluids). energy conversion (effluents from refineries and power plants). and environmental engineering (leachates from waste repositories). Similarly. the demands of miniaturization in electronics and in biomedical applications are driving research into the flow of heat and fluids through small-scale porous media (heat exchangers. filters. gas exchangers). Filters. catalytic converters. the drying of stored grains. and a myriad of other applications involve flows through porous media. By providing a unified theoretical framework that includes not only the traditional homogeneous and isotropic media but also models in which the assumptions of representative elemental volumes or global thermal equilibrium fail. the book provides practicing engineers the tools they need to analyze complex situations that arise in practice.

1211543,Quantitative emergence--A refined approach based on divergence measures,2010,Dominik Fisch and Martin Jänicke and Bernhard Sick and Christian Müller-Schloer,,,,94-103,IEEE,The article addresses the phenomenon of emergence from a technical viewpoint. A technical system exhibits emergence when it has certain kinds of properties or qualities that are irreducible in the sense that they are not traceable to the constituent parts of the system. In particular. we show how emergence in technical systems can be detected and measured gradually using techniques from the field of probability theory and information theory. To detect or measure emergence we observe the system and extract characteristic attributes from those observations. As an extension of earlier work in the field. we propose emergence measures that are well-suited for continuous attributes (or hybrid attribute sets) using either non-parametric or model-based probability density estimation techniques. We also replace the known entropy-based emergence measures by divergence measures for probability densities (eg. the …,True,sGAKnroAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,49,https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/saso/2010/4232a094/12OmNAHEpBy,4544847036483241807,/scholar?cites=4544847036483241807,,,0,0,0

Such a generative classifier aims at modeling the processes underlying the “generation” of the data. 4DS considers the distance of samples (observations) to the decision boundary. the density in regions. where samples are selected. the diversity of samples in the query set that are chosen for labeling. and. indirectly. the unknown class distribution of the samples by utilizing the responsibilities of the model components for these samples. The combination of the four measures in 4DS is self-optimizing in the sense that the weights of the distance. density. and class distribution measures depend on the currently estimated performance of the classifier.

An appropriate selection strategy has to choose unlabeled data for such user queries in an efficient and effective way (in principle. high classification performance at low labeling costs). In our transductive active learning approach we provide a completely labeled data pool (samples are either labeled by the experts or in a semi-supervised way) in each active learning cycle. Thereby. a key aspect is to explore and exploit information about structure in data.

AL has to be done by means of a data set where a low fraction of samples (also termed data points or observations) are labeled. To obtain labels for the unlabeled samples. the active learner has to ask an oracle (e.g.. a human expert) for labels. In most cases. the goal is to maximize some metric assessing the task performance (e.g.. the classification accuracy) and to minimize the number of queries at the same time. In this article. we first briefly discuss the state-of-the-art in the field of AL.

Certain bases of orthogonal functions allow for a definition of fast update algorithms for approximations of time series in sliding or growing time windows.

Drivers typically do not use all available comfort functions optimally. if at all. in every situation they would offer a substantial increase in comfort. Automating such functions as proactive recommender systems would exploit the full potential for decreasing driver stress. Because comfort functions are highly dependent on the driver's habits. learning the individual user behavior is necessary. We propose a probabilistic method for modelling and predicting location dependent user behavior of comfort function activations. The model applies second-order uncertainty to evaluate the certainty about inferred parameter values and it deals with novelty and decaying observations explicitly. The results of this study show that the use of probabilistic models for learning location based user behavior in car comfort functions is a promising technique and gives reason to further investigate this area of studies.,True,TStZQPQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1,https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/2842,96789397709173769,/scholar?cites=96789397709173769,,https://dl.gi.de/bitstream/handle/20.500.12116/2842/2121.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Our approach is based on an extension of single-output quantile regression (QR) to multivariate-targets. called quantile surfaces (QS). QS uses a simple yet compelling idea of indexing observations of a probabilistic forecast through direction and vector length to estimate a central tendency. We extend the single-output QR technique to multivariate probabilistic targets. QS efficiently models dependencies in multivariate target variables and represents probability distributions through discrete quantile levels. Therefore. we present a novel two-stage process. In the first stage. we perform a deterministic point forecast (ie. central tendency estimation). Subsequently. we model the prediction uncertainty using QS involving neural networks called quantile surface regression neural networks (QSNN). Additionally. we introduce new methods for efficient and straightforward evaluation of the reliability and sharpness of the issued probabilistic QS predictions. We complement this by the directional extension of the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) score. Finally. we evaluate our novel approach on synthetic data and two currently researched real-world challenges in two different domains: First. probabilistic forecasting for renewable energy power generation. second. short-term cyclists trajectory forecasting for autonomously driving vehicles. Especially for the latter. our empirical results show that even a simple one-layer QSNN outperforms traditional parametric multivariate forecasting techniques. thus improving the state-of-the-art performance.,True,TStZQPQAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05898,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05898,0,0,0

In this work. an extrusion–spheronization method was adopted to prepare pellets with strong anti-attrition ability. and novel biomass templates of raw and defatted microalgae were used to enhance the CO2 capture performance of CaO-based pellets with low microalgae doping ratios (0.5–2 wt.%). Experiments without and with excessive (5–20 wt.%) microalgae doped pellets were also produced for comparisons. The results show that a small amount (0.5–2 wt.%) of microalgae was able to significantly enhance the CO2 capture capacity of the pellets.

In this work. Yb2O3-supported CaO-based sorbents were fabricated via the wet-mixing technique. Elemental dispersion observed by FSEM-EDS showed that the ultrafine active species of CaO particles was finely separated by Yb2O3. Different amounts of Yb2O3 were introduced and 10−15 wt% was found to be the optimal content range for the support to function as the metal skeleton. In comparison with pure CaO. the improved CO2 capture performance was observed for CaYb10 over prolonged carbonation-calcination cycles under a severe test condition. This improvement could be ascribed to the enriched macropores within 50–100 nm. which was identified by the N2 adsorption–desorption analysis.

The route mainly includes three parts: direct aqueous carbonation of phosphogypsum. use of the obtained carbonation product for CO2 capture in the calcium looping process (CLP). and manufacture of cement clinker using the spent CaO-based sorbent. The direct use of the CO2 derived from cement plant flue gas (20 vol % CO2) is able to convert 94.5% of CaSO4 in the phosphogypsum into CaCO3. However. a long time of 90 min is required for the completion of the conversion.

Compared with the reducing end in cellobiose. the levoglucosan end in maltosan enhanced the cleavage of glycosidic bonds. which led to the maximum weight loss of maltosan at a lower temperature (i.e. 232 °C) than that of cellobiose (i.e. 299 °C).

CO2 uptake tests and kinetic analysis were carried out to screen sorbent pellets. Experimental results showed that the CO2 capture capacity of sorbent pellets was lower than that of powdery sorbents. which was mainly attributed to reduced Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area caused by pore structure damage during the pelletization process. However. the sorbent pellet CaSi75p containing 75 wt % CaO and 25 wt % Ca2SiO4 was less affected by pelletization than other sorbent pellets. which can be explained by the formation of cracks and pores that resulted from the crystalline change of Ca2SiO4 during the calcination–carbonation cycles.

1211627,Using the Novel Method of Nonthermal Plasma To Add Cl Active Sites on Activated Carbon for Removal of Mercury from Flue Gas,2016,Bi Zhang and Xiaobo Zeng and Ping Xu and Juan Chen and Yang Xu and Guangqian Luo and Minghou Xu and Hong Yao,50,Environmental science & technology,21,11837-11843,American Chemical Society,A new method using nonthermal plasma to add Cl active sites on activated carbon was proposed to improve the efficiency of activated carbon (AC) for removal of mercury from flue gas. The experiments were conducted via a lab-scale dielectric barrier discharge nonthermal plasma system and a vertical adsorption reactor. The results showed that the nonthermal plasma treatment with a small amount of Cl2 successfully added Cl active sites on AC and greatly increased the mercury removal efficiency of AC by chemisorption in a very short treatment time. The increase in Cl2 concentration for AC treatment promoted the efficiency of AC. The capacity of mercury adsorption positively correlated with the content of Cl2 for AC treatment. which depends on the number of Cl active sites on activated carbon. The treated AC maintained a high mercury removal efficiency within a temperature range of 30–210 °C.

A range of analyses were carried out. including biochar oxidation reactivity. inorganic species. oxygen and hydrogen contents in the biochars. release of heteroatoms in biochar as the gaseous product. and biochar structural evolution during thermal annealing. Extensive thermal annealing (up to 600 min) of biochars at 750 and 900 °C leads to little loss of inorganic species from the biochars.

Further analysis of the liquid products obtained at various temperatures suggests that the amorphous portion within microcrystalline cellulose contains some short glucose chain segments hinged with crystalline cellulose via weak bonds (e.g.. hydrogen bonds).

Cryogenic ball milling for 2 min also results in a significant size reduction but only little change in cellulose crystallinity and specific reactivity during hydrolysis. Therefore. crystallinity is the dominant factor in determining the hydrolysis reactivity of cellulose in HCW while particle size only plays a minor role. Ball milling also significantly influences the distribution of glucose oligomers in the primary liquid products of cellulose hydrolysis.

The bioslurry-based supply chain utilizes distributed pyrolysers within the biomass production area. converts the harvested green biomass into bioslurry fuels. and then delivers the bioslurry fuels to a central bioenergy plant.

The loading of MgCl2 lowers the onset temperature of cellulose pyrolysis. At low temperatures (e.g.. 150 °C). the loading of MgCl2 increases the yield of water-soluble intermediates and significantly enhances the formation of sugar and anhydro-sugar oligomers. However. the effect of NaCl loading is minimal under the similar conditions. The results suggest that the loading of MgCl2 catalyzes the cleavage of both hydrogen bonds and glycosidic bonds during cellulose pyrolysis at low temperatures. At increased temperatures (250 °C and above). both the loading of NaCl and the loading of MgCl2 greatly enhance the destruction of sugar ring structures within the pyrolyzing cellulose.

Pyrolysis experiments using both raw sewage sludge and seven sludge samples loaded with various organic sulfur compounds were performed to determine the effects of the type of organic sulfur on the release of sulfur-containing gases. It was observed that the formation of H2S. the predominant odorant. significantly increases at temperatures above 150 °C. Aliphatic and aromatic sulfur compounds were found to be the two main organic sulfur sources for the release of sulfur-containing gases. The release of sulfur-containing gases from aliphatic sulfur greatly increases at 250 °C. whereas significant sulfur-containing gases are released from aromatic sulfur at relatively high temperatures of 350–450 °C.

The strong hydrogen bonding networks in crystalline cellulose appear to preserve the sugar ring structure during pyrolysis so that the yield (a maximum of ∼30% on a carbon basis at 250 °C) of water-soluble intermediates for amorphous cellulose is considerably higher than that (a maximum of ∼3% on a carbon basis at 270 °C) of crystalline cellulose pyrolysis.

During cellulose pyrolysis. although the inter-molecular hydrogen bonds are slightly stronger. both intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds can break at low temperatures (i.e.. >120 °C). leading to the formation of free hydroxyl. Due to the weakened hydrogen bonds in cellulose. dehydration reactions firstly take place to produce saturated carbonyls. at a lower temperature (i.e.. 240 °C) for amorphous cellulose.

H2O-soluble salts and carboxylates) in kitchen waste during torrefaction at 200–300 °C was investigated in this study. It was found that sodium release is negligible (<2%) at 200 °C after torrefaction for 15 min. but the release increases to ∼10% when the temperature is increased to 300 °C. Because of the high concentration of water-soluble sodium in raw noodles. the release of sodium during torrefaction is mainly in the form of NaHCO3 or Na2CO3. as NaCl is relatively stable at torrefaction temperatures. The transformation of Na from a water-soluble form to a CH3COONH4-soluble form during torrefaction was found to be an important factor in the release of sodium from raw noodles. since sodium release occurs much more readily from a Na-exchanged sample during torrefaction.

As stronger Lewis acids. the alkaline earth metal ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+) are more effective than the alkali metal ions (Na+ and K+) to catalyze the dehydration reactions of sugar structures. leading to the formation of more cross-linked cellulose for the alkaline earth metal chloride-loaded celluloses.

However. high dynamic performance is still one of its constraints. Smearing appears. making it more difficult to distinguish the energy dispersive star point from the noise. An effective star acquisition approach for motion-blurred star image is proposed in this work. The correlation filter and mathematical morphology algorithm is combined to enhance the signal energy and evaluate slowly varying background noise.

The organic Rankine cycle technology is a well-established solution for the energy conversion of thermal power from biomass combustion. geothermal reservoirs. and waste heat from industrial processes. However. its economic feasibility has not yet been demonstrated for marine applications. This paper aims at evaluating the potential of using organic Rankine cycle systems for waste heat recovery aboard ships. The suitable vessels and engine heat sources are identified by estimating the total recoverable energy. Different cycle architectures. working fluids. components. and control strategies are analyzed.

The machine learning algorithm trained on dynamic data from shorter time intervals of the engine features together with longer time interval data for the fuel consumption. To give the operator and ship owner real-time energy efficiency statistics. it is essential to be able to predict the dynamic fuel oil consumption.

The bubble behaviours are simulated experimentally and the electric force acting on bubble is calculated numerically. The results indicate that bubbles are compressed intensely by the horizontal component of the electric stress and elongated by the vertical component. thus prolate spherical bubbles in the direction of electric field are formed. The investigation shows that both the rate of bubble deformation and the contact angle increase with electric field strength.

The effect of the delta wing on the strong swirling flow is analysed using the Discrete Particle Method. The results show that the delta wings re-compress the upstream flow and the gas Mach number decreases correspondingly. However. the Mach number does not vary significantly from the small. medium and large delta wing configurations. The small delta wing generates a swirl near its surface. but has minor influences on the flow above it. On the contrary. the use of the large delta wing produces a strong swirling flow in the whole downstream region. For the large delta wing. the collection efficiency reaches 70% with 2 μm particles. indicating a good separation performance of the proposed supersonic separator.,True,6zKBD4gAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,33,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591016304533,11121728045595337495,/scholar?cites=11121728045595337495,,https://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/wen2016b.pdf,0,0,0

The larger particles moved downward on the internal surface and were removed due to the outer vortex near the wall. Most of the tiny particles went into the inner vortex zones and escaped from the up-outlet.

The mechanisms of the upstream and downstream influences are not well understood for various flow conditions from the wellhead and the back pipelines. We used a computational model to investigate the effect of the inlet and outlet flow conditions on the supersonic separation process. We found that the shock wave was sensitive to the inlet or back pressure compared to the inlet temperature. The shock position shifted forward with a higher inlet or back pressure. It indicated that an increasing inlet pressure declined the pressure recovery capacity. Furthermore. the shock wave moved out of the diffuser when the ratio of the back pressure to the inlet one was greater than 0.75. in which the state of the low pressure and temperature was destroyed. resulting in the re-evaporation of the condensed liquids.

One of the key issues for this novel technology is the complex supersonic swirling flow that is not well understood. A swirling device composed of an ellipsoid and several helical blades is designed for an annular supersonic separator. The supersonic swirling separation flow of natural gas is calculated using the Reynolds Stress model. The results show that the viscous heating and strong swirling flow cause the adverse pressure in the annular channel. which may negatively affect the separation performance. When the swirling flow passes through the annular nozzle. it will damage the expansion characteristics of the annular nozzle.

The mechanisms of the upstream and downstream influences are not well understood for various flow conditions from the wellhead and the back pipelines. We used a computational model to investigate the effect of the inlet and outlet flow conditions on the supersonic separation process. We found that the shock wave was sensitive to the inlet or back pressure compared to the inlet temperature. The shock position shifted forward with a higher inlet or back pressure. It indicated that an increasing inlet pressure declined the pressure recovery capacity. Furthermore. the shock wave moved out of the diffuser when the ratio of the back pressure to the inlet one was greater than 0.75. in which the state of the low pressure and temperature was destroyed. resulting in the re-evaporation of the condensed liquids.

Among these alternative fuels. diesel-ethanol and diesel-biodiesel blends gain the most attention due to their quality characteristics and environmentally friendly nature. The viscosity and density of these biodiesel blends are slightly higher than diesel. which is a significant barrier to the commercialization of biodiesel. In this study. the density and viscosity of 30 different ternary biodiesel blends was investigated at 15 С and 40 С. respectively. Different density and viscosity models were developed and tested on biodiesel blends soured from different feedstock’s including palm. coconut. soybean. mustard. and calophyllum oils. The prognostic ability and precisions of these developed models was assessed statistically using Absolute Percentage Error (APE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE of 0.045% and 0.085% for density model and 1.85%. 1.41%. 3.48% and 2.27%. 1.85%. 3.50% for viscosity models were obtained on% volume and% mass basis. These developed correlations are useful for ternary biodiesel blends where alcohols are the part of biodiesel blends. The modeled values of densities and viscosities of ternary blends were significantly comparable with the measured densities and viscosities. which are feasible to avoid the harm of vehicles’ operability.

Governments in different countries have been engaged in developing regulations and related policies to encourage environment friendly renewable energy generation along with conservation strategies and technological innovations. It is important to develop sustainable energy policies and provide relevant and suitable policy recommendations for end-users. This study presents a review on sustainable energy policy for promotion of renewable energy by introducing the development history of energy policy in five countries. ie. the United States. Germany. the United Kingdom. Denmark and China. A survey of the articles aimed at promoting the development of sustainable energy policies and their modelling is carried out. It is observed that energy-efficiency standard is one of the most popular strategy for building energy saving. which is dynamic and renewed based on the current available technologies. Feed-in-tariff has been widely applied to encourage the application of renewable energy. which is demonstrated successfully in different countries.

However. high-resolution monitoring of urban water bodies using remote sensing remains a challenge because of the limitation of previous water indices and the dark building shadow effect. To address this problem. we proposed an automated urban water extraction method (UWEM) which combines a new water index. together with a building shadow detection method. Firstly. we trained the parameters of UWEM using ZY-3 imagery of Qingdao. China. Then we verified the algorithm using five other sub-scenes (Aksu. Fuzhou. Hanyang. Huangpo and Huainan) ZY-3 imagery. The performance was compared with that of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Results indicated that UWEM performed significantly better at the sub-scenes with kappa coefficients improved by 7.87%. 32.35%. 12.64%. 29.72%. 14.29%. respectively. and total omission and commission error reduced by 61.53%. 65.74%. 83.51%. 82.44%. and 74.40%. respectively. Furthermore. UWEM has more stable performances than NDWI’s in a range of thresholds near zero. It reduces the over-and under-estimation issues which often accompany previous water indices when mapping urban surface water under complex environmental conditions.

Colorado,2011,Jida Wang and Giorgos Mountrakis,25,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2,229-253,Taylor & Francis,Urbanization is an important issue concerning diverse scientific and policy communities. Computational models quantifying locations and quantities of urban growth offer numerous environmental and socioeconomic benefits. Traditional urban growth models are based on a single-algorithm fitting procedure and thus restricted on their ability to capture spatial heterogeneity. Accordingly. a GIS-based modeling framework titled multi-network urbanization (MuNU) model is developed that integrates multiple neural networks. The MuNU model enables a filtering approach where input data patterns are automatically reallocated into appropriate neural networks with targeted accuracies. We hypothesize that observations classified by individual neural networks share greater homogeneity. and thus modeling accuracy will increase with the integration of multiple targeted algorithms.

We introduce an alternative urban growth model specifically designed to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in urban growth models. Instead of applying a single method to the entire study area. we segment the study area into different regions and apply targeted algorithms in each subregion. The working hypothesis is that the integration of appropriately selected region-specific models will outperform a globally applied model as it will incorporate further spatial heterogeneity. We examine urban land use changes in Denver. Colorado. Two land use maps from different time snapshots (1977 and 1997) are used to detect the urban land use changes. and 23 explanatory factors are produced to model urbanization. The proposed Spatially Heterogeneous Expert Based (SHEB) model tested decision trees as the underlying modeling algorithm. applying them in different subregions. In this paper the segmentation tested is the division of the entire area into interior and exterior urban areas. Interior urban areas are those situated within dense urbanized structures. while exterior urban areas are outside of these structures. Obtained results on this model regionalization technique indicate that targeted local models produce improved results in terms of Kappa. accuracy percentage and multi-scale performance.

However. the influences of changing surface water area on the global water budget have largely been neglected. Here we estimate an extra water flux of 30.38 ± 15.51 km3/year omitted in global evaporation calculation caused by a net increase of global surface water area between periods 1984–1999 and 2000–2015. Our estimate is at a similar magnitude to the recent average annual change in global evapotranspiration assuming a stationary surface water area.

However. an integrated understanding of the debris-free and debris-covered glacier evolution and its interaction with glacial lake is still lacking. Using one case study in the Gyirong River Basin located in the central Himalayas. this paper applied archival Landsat imagery and an automated mapping method to understand how glaciers and glacial lakes interactively evolved between 1988 and 2015. Our analyses identified 467 glaciers in 1988. containing 435 debris-free and 32 debris-covered glaciers. with a total area of 614.09±36.69 km 2. These glaciers decreased by 16.45% in area from 1988 to 2015. with an accelerated retreat rate after 1994. Debris-free glaciers retreated faster than debris-covered glaciers. As a result of glacial downwasting. supraglacial debris coverage expanded upward by 17.79 km 2 (24.44%). Concurrent with glacial retreat. glacial lakes increased in both number (+ 41) and area (+ 54.11%). Glacier-connected lakes likely accelerated the glacial retreat via thermal energy transmission and contributed to over 15% of the area loss in their connected glaciers. On the other hand. significant glacial retreats led to disconnections from their proglacial lakes. which appeared to stabilize the lake areas. Continuous expansions in the lakes connected with debris-covered glaciers. therefore. need additional attention due to their potential outbursts. In comparison with precipitation variation. temperature increase was the primary driver of such glacier and glacial lake changes.

Particularly with the implementation of the National Western Development Strategies since 1999. more and more mining activities and related infrastructure constructions have been conducted on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Mining activities are known to have substantial impacts on plant dynamics and hence the water and energy cycles. Identifying mining activities and quantifying their effects on vegetation cover are critical to the monitoring and protection of the pristine TP environment. Thus. this study aims to develop an automated approach that detects the timing of initial mining development and assess the spatial distribution of mining-ruined vegetation. The Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithm was used to decompose the signal in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series derived from high-frequency MODIS images. and to detect abrupt changes of surface vegetation. Results show that the BFAST algorithm is able to effectively identify abrupt changes in vegetation cover as a result of open-mining development on the studied alpine grassland. The testing study in Muli Town of Qinghai Province shows that the mining development began in 2003 and massive destructions of vegetation cover followed between 2008 and 2012.

Yet. for the vast majority of reservoirs around the world. their locations and related information. especially for newly dammed reservoirs. are not readily available due to financial. political. or legal considerations. This study proposes an automated method of identifying newly dammed reservoirs from time series of MODIS-derived NDWI (normalized difference water index) images. Its main idea lies in the detection of abrupt changes in the NDWI time series that are associated with land-to-water conversion due to the reservoir impoundment. The proposed method is tested in the upper reach of the Yellow River that is severely regulated by constructed reservoirs. Our results show that five newly dammed reservoirs were identified in the test area during 2000–2018. Validated against high-resolution Google Earth imagery. our method is effective to determine both locations of the emerging medium-size reservoirs and the timing of their initial water impoundments. Such information then allows for a refined calculation of the reservoir inundation extents and storage capacities through the combination of higher-resolution Landsat imagery and SRTM DEM. The comparison of our estimated reservoir areas and capacities against documented information further indicates that the integration of multi-mission remote sensing data may provide useful information for understanding reservoir operations and impacts on river discharges.

However. high-resolution monitoring of urban water bodies using remote sensing remains a challenge because of the limitation of previous water indices and the dark building shadow effect. To address this problem. we proposed an automated urban water extraction method (UWEM) which combines a new water index. together with a building shadow detection method. Firstly. we trained the parameters of UWEM using ZY-3 imagery of Qingdao. China. Then we verified the algorithm using five other sub-scenes (Aksu. Fuzhou. Hanyang. Huangpo and Huainan) ZY-3 imagery. The performance was compared with that of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Results indicated that UWEM performed significantly better at the sub-scenes with kappa coefficients improved by 7.87%. 32.35%. 12.64%. 29.72%. 14.29%. respectively. and total omission and commission error reduced by 61.53%. 65.74%. 83.51%. 82.44%. and 74.40%. respectively. Furthermore. UWEM has more stable performances than NDWI’s in a range of thresholds near zero.

1212068,High-resolution mapping of urban surface water using ZY-3 multi-spectral imagery,2015,Fangfang Yao and Chao Wang and Di Dong and Jiancheng Luo and Zhanfeng Shen and Kehan Yang,7,Remote Sensing,9,12336-12355,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Accurate information of urban surface water is important for assessing the role it plays in urban ecosystem services under the content of urbanization and climate change. However. high-resolution monitoring of urban water bodies using remote sensing remains a challenge because of the limitation of previous water indices and the dark building shadow effect. To address this problem. we proposed an automated urban water extraction method (UWEM) which combines a new water index. together with a building shadow detection method. Firstly. we trained the parameters of UWEM using ZY-3 imagery of Qingdao. China. Then we verified the algorithm using five other sub-scenes (Aksu. Fuzhou. Hanyang. Huangpo and Huainan) ZY-3 imagery. The performance was compared with that of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Results indicated that UWEM performed significantly better at the sub-scenes with kappa coefficients improved by 7.87%. 32.35%. 12.64%. 29.72%. 14.29%. respectively. and total omission and commission error reduced by 61.53%. 65.74%. 83.51%. 82.44%. and 74.40%. respectively. Furthermore. UWEM has more stable performances than NDWI’s in a range of thresholds near zero. It reduces the over-and under-estimation issues which often accompany previous water indices when mapping urban surface water under complex environmental conditions.

It meets the needs of refined farmland management. This study presents an improved identification procedure for geo-parcel based crop identification by combining fine-resolution images and multi-source medium-resolution images. GF-2 images with fine spatial resolution of 0.8 m provided agricultural farming plot boundaries. and GF-1 (16 m) and Landsat 8 OLI data were used to transform the geo-parcel based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time-series. In this study. we propose a piecewise EVI time-series smoothing method to fit irregular time profiles. especially for crop rotation situations. Global EVI time-series were divided into several temporal segments. from which phenological metrics could be derived. This method was applied to Lixian. where crop rotation was the common practice of growing different types of crops. in the same plot. in sequenced seasons. After collection of phenological features and multi-temporal spectral information. Random Forest (RF) was performed to classify crop types. and the overall accuracy was 93.27%. Moreover. an analysis of feature significance showed that phenological features were of greater importance for distinguishing agricultural land cover compared to temporal spectral information. The identification results indicated that the integration of high spatial-temporal resolution imagery is promising for geo-parcel based crop identification and that the newly proposed smoothing method is effective.

Because the spectral characteristics of coastal water are susceptible to regional environment. the traditional method of normalized difference water index (NDWI) threshold segmentation may easily misclassify water as land in the process of separation of land and water. which will seriously affect the accuracy of shoreline extraction. In this paper. on the basis of NDWI model. the authors proposed an automatic coastline extraction method based on classification sample auto-selection and support vector machine (SVM). Firstly. through the NDWI calculation and global threshold segmentation. the initial water distribution information is obtained. And then. the classification samples are selected automatically under the control of NDWI information. Thirdly. the water are separated from the land by using SVM classifier. The last step is to fill small terrestrial water body units and track coastline automatically. The experimental results show that this method can effectively enhance the capability of coastal water identification and improve the accuracy and automation of the coastline extraction from remote sensing imager.[Fund]: 国家自然科学基金项目 (编号: 40971228 41101041 41201460);; 国家科技支撑计划项目 (编号: 2011BAH06B02);; 水利部公益性行业科研专项经费项目 (编号: 201201092) 共同资助,True,7OCF0kIAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,19,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-GTYG201302014.htm,7639146331924724822,/scholar?cites=7639146331924724822,,,0,0,0

We completely investigate the 131 lakes that were observed by both ICESat and CryoSat-2. The mean change rate of water level for all of examined lakes in P 2 (0.19±0.03 m· year–1) is slightly lower than that (0.21±0.02 m· year–1) observed in P 1. The extended lake level time series also indicates that. in the past few years. lakes in the Northern Changtang (especially in Hol Xil) showed accelerated growth; and that the extensive lake level rises north to the Gangdise Mountains. during 2003–2009. were found dampened during the CryoSat-2 observation period. The spatio-temporal heterogeneity of precipitation observed from weather stations can be used to partly explain the observed temporal pattern of lake level changes over different sub-zones of the plateau.

However. there are few studies on vegetation phenology for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and most are based on field records of stations. Methods We utilized the dynamic threshold method to explore vegetation phenological metrics (greenup date. length of season and senescence date) of typical grassland in the Northern Tibetan Plateau. We used time-series TERRA/MODIS EVI data for 2001–2010 reconstructed by the asymmetric Gaussian function fitting method to analyze spatial pattern and differentiation of vegetation phenology and its inter-annual variation and to examine the relationship between phenological variation and climate changes. Important findings The spatial pattern of date of vegetation greenup was embodied by transition from southeast to northwest and vertical zonation in the mountainous topography of the southeast. The vegetation greenup date in approximately sixty percent of the northern Tibetan Plateau had advanced. especially in high mountains. Interannual variation of vegetation senescence date was not obvious. and most of the region had natural inter-annual fluctuations. The variation of growing season length is influenced by greenup and senescence dates. but was chiefly affected by advanced greenup date lengthening the growing season. Among the four different climatic zones in the study area. the mountain and valley Nagqu sub-arctic and sub-humid zone and the southern Qinghai sub-arctic and semi-arid zone had the most apparent advanced greenup date and …,True,4N1olTEAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC,36,https://www.plant-ecology.com/EN/10.3724/SP.J.1258.2011.00853,7242668050752629280,/scholar?cites=7242668050752629280,,https://www.plant-ecology.com/EN/article/downloadArticleFile.do?attachType=PDF&id=5699,0,0,0

We denote the periods with visibility below 2 km as extreme haze and refer to the rest as reference periods. During the measurements in Xi'an an extreme haze covered the city for about a week and the total non-refractory (NR)-PM2.5 mass fraction reached peak concentrations of over 1000 µg m−3. During the measurements in Beijing two extreme haze events occurred. but the temporal extent and the total concentrations reached during these events were lower than in Xi'an. Average PM2.5 concentrations of 537 ± 146 and 243 ± 47 µg m−3 (including NR species and equivalent black carbon. eBC) were recorded during the extreme haze events in Xi'an and Beijing. respectively. During the reference periods the measured average concentrations were 140 ± 99 µg m−3 in Xi'an and 75 ± 61 µg m−3 in Beijing. The relative composition of the NR-PM2.5 evolved substantially during the extreme haze periods. with increased contributions of the inorganic components (mostly sulfate and nitrate). Our results suggest that the high relative humidity present during the extreme haze events had a strong effect on the increase of sulfate mass (via aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide). Another relevant characteristic of the extreme haze is the size of the measured particles. During the extreme haze events. the AMS showed much larger particles. with a volume weighted mode at about 800 to 1000 nm. in contrast to about …,True,wvOEfa0AAAAJ:cInq4TRmCz8C,211,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/16/3207/2016/,2893284454006803150,/scholar?cites=2893284454006803150,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/16/3207/2016/acp-16-3207-2016.pdf,0,0,0

At each site. litterbags containing a dominant local litter were placed in the field in replicated plots. Half the bags were treated with naphthalene to reduce microarthropod abundance. The pattern of mass loss was markedly seasonal at the temperate site. The amount of mass remaining after 250 days was strongly related to the initial %N of the three litter types (r2=0.997). The faunated litterbags lost more mass at all sites and for all litters studied than the litterbags with reduced microarthropod populations. The effect was minimal at the temperate site where the fauna tended to increase the decomposition rate only towards the end of the year.

Tunable laser absorption spectroscopy is combined with tomographic reconstruction techniques to resolve small diameter ( < 1 cm) non-uniform flow fields with steep spatial gradients. leveraging emerging mid-wave infrared photonics. Multiple novel measurement methods. hardware configurations. and image processing techniques were investigated. Initially. a mid-infrared laser absorption tomography sensing method was developed for quantitative measurement of CO and CO2 concentrations and temperature distributions in turbulent premixed jet flames using a translation-stage-mounted optical system. This sensing approach was used to examine effects of varying fuel structure on carbon oxidation over a range of Reynolds number regimes. It was found that spatial and temporal resolution is limited in this method due to the finite laser beam size (~ 1 mm) and the slow mechanical translation of the optical system. To address these limitations. a novel laser absorption imaging (LAI) technique. that expands a single laser beam and replaces the detector with a high-speed infrared camera. was introduced to achieve enhanced spatial and temporal resolution for thermo-chemical imaging.

This task becomes extremely challenging for real fuels. Gasoline is a mixture of hundreds of different hydrocarbons. Detailed modeling of its chemistry requires huge numbers of species and reactions and exceeds present numerical capabilities. Consequently. simpler surrogate mixtures are adopted to approximate the behavior of the real fuels. Large kinetic models for surrogates are developed to characterize their chemistry. but these models still contain thousands of species and reactions and can usually only be used for simulating simple homogeneous systems. For multidimensional engine applications. they must be reduced.

The strategy exploits the band narrowing effects of line mixing. which acutely impact spectrally dense regions. such as bandheads. where line spacing is small. Line mixing is shown to counter collisional line-broadening effects that reduce differential absorption at elevated pressures and often limit the pressure range of laser absorption methods. In this work. the R-branch bandheads of CO and CO2. which are only observed at high temperatures relevant to combustion. are targeted near 2.3 µm and 4.2 µm. respectively. Spectral line-mixing models were developed for each bandhead region to account for the collision-induced population transfer rates between rotational energy states over a wide range of …,True,A177K1EAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748920306210,2474410399600980441,/scholar?cites=2474410399600980441,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Lee123/publication/346347036_Exploiting_line-mixing_effects_for_laser_absorption_spectroscopy_at_extreme_combustion_pressures/links/5fd998ef92851c13fe8c23ed/Exploiting-line-mixing-effects-for-laser-absorption-spectroscopy-at-extreme-combustion-pressures.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion is a process dominated by chemical kinetics of the fuel-air mixture. The hottest part of the mixture ignites first. and compresses the rest of the charge. which then ignites after a short time lag. Crevices and boundary layers generally remain too cold to react. and result in substantial hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. Turbulence has little effect on HCCI combustion. and may be most important as a factor in determining temperature gradients and boundary layer thickness inside the cylinder. The importance of thermal gradients inside the cylinder makes it necessary to use an integrated fluid mechanicschemical kinetics code for accurate predictions of HCCI combustion.

Detailed comparisons of model predictions with laser Raman experimental data provide a valuable evaluation of the model's ability in predicting nonequilibrium chemistry in turbulent nonpremixed flames. Overall. the model fails to predict greater departure from chemical equilibrium as mixing rates are increased. Interestingly. this failure is not due to the chemical model. both of which perform satisfactorily. Instead. the failure to predict greater departure …,True,TFaJxCwAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,166,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00102208908924038,7237101310751679230,/scholar?cites=7237101310751679230,,,0,0,0

Inc.,We have developed a methodology for predicting combustion and emissions in a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Engine. The methodology judiciously uses a fluid mechanics code followed by a chemical kinetics code to achieve great reduction in the computational requirements; to a level that can be handled with current computers. In previous papers. our sequential. multi-zone methodology has been applied to HCCI combustion of short-chain hydrocarbons (natural gas and propane). Applying the same procedure to long chain hydrocarbons (iso-octane) results in unacceptably long computational time. In this paper. we show how the computational time can be made acceptable by developing a segregated solver. This reduces the run time of a ten-zone problem by an order of magnitude and thus makes it much more practical to make combustion studies of long-chain hydrocarbons.

1212349,On-orbit results and lessons learned from the ASTERIA space telescope mission,2018,Matthew Smith and Amanda Donner and Mary Knapp and Christopher Pong and Colin Smith and Jason Luu and Peter Di Pasquale and Brian Campuzano,,,,,,The Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research in Astrophysics (ASTERIA) was deployed from the International Space Station (ISS) on 20 November 2017. beginning a technology demonstration and opportunistic science mission to advance the state of the art in nanosatellite performance for astrophysical observations. The goal of ASTERIA is to achieve arcsecond-level line-of-sight pointing error and highly stable focal plane temperature control. These capabilities enable precision photometry—ie the careful measurement of stellar brightness over time—which in turn allows investigation of astrophysical phenomena such as transiting exoplanets. By the end of the 90-day prime mission. ASTERIA had achieved line-of-sight pointing stability of approximately 0.5 arcseconds root mean square (RMS) over 20-minute observations. pointing repeatability of 1 milliarcsecond RMS from one observation to the next. and focal plane temperature stability better than±0.01 K over 20-minute observations. This paper presents an overview of the ASTERIA flight and ground system. summarizes the pre-delivery test campaign. and discusses the on-orbit performance obtained by the pointing and thermal control subsystems. We also describe the process for planning opportunistic science observations and present lessons learned from development and operations. Having successfully operated for over 200 days as of this writing.

A newly-designed probe consisting of two single-crystal sapphire rods is used to guide 2.9 μm laser light across the core of a flame while avoiding absorption by water outside of the flame. The sensor probes two H 2 O transitions near 2.9 μm using a scanned-wavelength-modulation absorption-spectroscopy spectral-fitting technique. which enables measurements without calibration or knowledge of the mixture collisional-broadening coefficient. To demonstrate the sensor. temperature and water mole fraction measurements were acquired in stoichiometric. burner-stabilized flames of methane/oxygen/argon at pressures of 25 Torr and 60 Torr.

In addition to experimental measurements. the results from a burner-stabilized flame and freely-propagating flame models are presented. A comparison of the modeling and experimental results in terms of flame standoff distance. stability limit conditions and species yields show excellent agreement across a broad range of equivalence ratios and preheat temperatures. Preheating of reactants increased the rich limit for stable operation from 1.26 to 1.75 for a given inlet velocity. and syngas yields were shown to increase with equivalence ratio. The preheat temperature of the reactants was shown to have little impact on syngas yields beyond extending the limits of stable operation.

Syngas is a highly desired product because it is very versatile. It can be used for combustion in turbines or engines. converted to H2 for use in fuel cells. turned into diesel or other high-molecular weight fuels by the Fischer-Tropsch process and used as a chemical feedstock. Syngas can be derived from hydrocarbons in the presence of oxidizer or water as in steam reforming. There are many demonstrated methods to produce syngas with or without water addition including catalytic methods. plasma reforming and combustion.  The goal of this study is to add to the understanding of non-catalytic conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to syngas. and this was accomplished through two investigations: the first on fuel conversion potential and the second on the effect of preheat temperature. A primarily experimental investigation of the conversion of jet fuel and butanol to syngas was undertaken to understand the potential of these fuels for conversion. With these new data and previously-published experimental data. a comparison amongst a larger set of fuels for conversion was also conducted. Significant soot formation was observed in experiments with both fuels. but soot formation was so significant in the jet fuel experiments that it limited the range of experimental operating conditions.

There are several coarse estimates that quantify the potential of algae as a feedstock for biodiesel. Some of these analyses have not incorporated specific values of algal lipid content and did not include processing inefficiencies.

1212365,Non-Catalytic Reforming with Applications to Portable Power,2013,Janet L Ellzey and Erica Belmont and Colin H Smith,,,,,TEXAS UNIV AT AUSTIN,Fuel cells are a promising technology as an alternative for portable power applications. because they offer higher power densities. do not include moving parts. and thus are free of noise and vibrations. At the current state of development. fuel cell systems cannot effectively use hydrocarbon fuels unless they have been processed. or reformed. into a syngas consisting of hydrogen. carbon monoxide. and other species. Conventional reforming technologies utilize catalysts which may have strict requirements on fuel purity and operating conditions. The development of a robust non-catalytic technique has the advantage of using a variety of logistics fuels. In this project. conversion of various fuels was demonstrated in two different non-catalytic reactors. The conversion of butanol and Jet-A were demonstrated in a filtration reactor consisting of a packed bed of spheres. A second reactor. consisting of counterflowing channels. has the advantage of stationary reactions zones and the ability to operate continuously. Conversion of heptane was demonstrated in this reactor and a computational study was conducted to understand the scaling of the reactor for various applications.

1212366,Effect of preheating on rich combustion for syngas production: experiments and modeling of burner-stabilized flames,2011,Colin H Smith and Daniel I Pineda and Janet L Ellzey,,,,,,The production of syngas from hydrocarbons is an important part of the hydrogen infrastructure. Previous experimental studies have shown that rich mixtures of methane. heptane. and ethanol are successfully converted to syngas in noncatalytic heat recirculating reactors but existing models fail to predict the efficiency of the conversion. Although the reactor designs vary. the primary feature is the recirculation of exhaust heat to preheat the reactants such that the flammability limits are extended and the burning rate is increased. Detailed modeling of these reactors. however. is complicated by the complex heat transfer processes. To understand modeling deficiencies. we are beginning an investigation of the conversion of rich mixtures of methane in a relatively simple flat flame burner with externally preheated reactants. The goal of this initial investigation with methane is to determine the similarity between the two burners that we use (an actively cooled McKenna burner and a ceramic matrix burner) and the computational model and to determine the effect of preheating on the expansion of the operating conditions of the ceramic burner. Experimental data include species measurements and operating range determinations.

Biofuels and hydrogen (H2) have the potential to meet this goal. Biofuels are attractive because they can be domestically produced and consume carbon dioxide (CO2) during the feedstock growth cycle. Hydrogen is appealing because its use emits no CO2. and because hydrogen fuel cells can be very efficient. Today most hydrogen is derived from syngas. a mixture of hydrogen. carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide. which is produced through catalytic steam reforming of methane (CH4).

1212372,Non-Catalytic. Partial Oxidation for Syngas Production,2009,Janet L Ellzey and Ingmar Schoegl and Colin H Smith,,The 2009 Spring National Meeting,,,,Although hydrogen is abundant in nature. it is primarily bound into other molecules such as hydrocarbons. The conversion. or reforming. of a hydrocarbon into a hydrogen-rich syngas may be accomplished through either catalytic or non-catalytic processes. We investigated non-catalytic syngas production with two different reactors: a reactor consisting of multiple parallel channels with alternating flow directions and a reactor consisting of porous inert media. In both devices. heat transfer from the hot products to the cold reactants promotes reactions of fuel-rich. syngas-producing mixtures that lie beyond the conventional flammability limit. For the parallel channel reactor. experimental results with methane/air and propane/air mixtures show that stable reaction fronts are obtained at a wide range of equivalence ratios and inlet velocities. A comparison of the reactor performance for methane/air and propane/air mixtures shows significant differences. which are attributed to the more complex reaction chemistry of rich propane combustion. With the porous media reactor. we investigated syngas production from wet ethanol. which is ethanol that has not been fully distilled or dehydrated. Ethanol is often promoted as the biofuel of the future. yet it is hindered by its overall production energy requirements. the most significant of which is water removal through distillation and dehydration. Through experiments and modeling. we studied the reforming of wet ethanol over a range of equivalence ratios. inlet velocities. and wet ethanol water fractions.

An advanced ignition technology that reliably extends the operating range of internal combustion engines will aid practical implementation of nextgeneration high-efficiency engines. The microwave-assisted spark plug under development by Imagineering.

Livermore. CA (United States),High-voltage (20 kV peak). single-pulse. nanosecond. low-temperature plasma discharges were examined in nitrogen-diluted desiccated air (15.9% oxygen) with addition of 1%. 2%. and 3% carbon dioxide or water for a pin-to-pin electrode configuration in an optically accessible spark calorimeter at elevated density (2.9 kg/m3). Discharge behavior was characterized through pressure-rise calorimetry. direct imaging of excited-state atomic oxygen. and high-speed schlieren. Increasing carbon dioxide or water concentration led to an increased likelihood of surface discharges rather than the desired streamer discharge between the pin electrodes. For streamer discharges. carbon dioxide addition decreased the electrical-to-thermal conversion efficiency. while minimal impact was observed for water. Both carbon dioxide and water addition led to faster pressure rise rates. Carbon dioxide addition decreased excited state atomic oxygen signal. while water addition led to negligible changes. Finally. increased streamer branching was observed in the schlieren images when carbon dioxide or water was added to the gas mixture.,True,XEVqmqwAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1424563,,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1424563,0,0,0

The model was validated against experimental data. including fuel pyrolysis in plug flow and jet-stirred reactors. laminar flame speeds. and ignition delay times behind reflected shock waves. with n-dodecane being the emphasis. Analysis of the computational results reveal that for a wide range of combustion conditions. the kinetics of fuel cracking to form smaller molecular fragments is fast and may be decoupled from the oxidation kinetics of the fragments. Subsequently. a simplified model containing a minimal set of 4 species and 20 reaction steps was developed to predict the fuel pyrolysis rate and product distribution.
