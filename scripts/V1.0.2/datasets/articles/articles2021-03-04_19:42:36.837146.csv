1141620,Production of iturin A by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens suppressing Rhizoctonia solani,2002,GY Yu and JB Sinclair and Glen L Hartman and BL Bertagnolli,34,Soil Biology and Biochemistry,7,955-963,Pergamon,Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain B94 was used as a biocontrol agent to suppress Rhizoctonia solani and other fungal plant pathogens. Three major antifungal compounds were purified from its culture broth. each has an amino acid composition consisting of Asn. Gln. Ser. Pro. and Tyr in a molar ratio of 3:1:1:1:1. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (FAB MS/MS) collision induced dissociation (CID) analysis showed that the antifungal compounds were three isomers of iturin A. a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic produced by Bacillus subtilis. One of the major compounds with a molecular weight of 1042.5533 was identified as iturin A2. The peptide backbone of this compound was opened chemically. and the resulting linear peptide partially sequenced using the Edman degradation method.

Soybean—worldwide production. use. and constraints caused by pathogens and pests,2011,Glen L Hartman and Ellen D West and Theresa K Herman,3,Food Security,1,5-17,Springer Netherlands,The soybean crop is one of the most important crops worldwide. Soybean seeds are important for both protein meal and vegetable oil. The crop is grown on an estimated 6% of the world’s arable land. and since the 1970s. the area in soybean production has the highest percentage increase compared to any other major crop. Recent increases in production coincide with increases in demand for meal and oil. Soybean production was 17 million metric tons (MMT) in 1960 and increased to 230 MMT in 2008. Future soybean production is expected to increase more than other crops. due to expanded production area and higher yields. There are a number of important abiotic and biotic constraints that threaten soybean production by directly reducing seed yields and/or seed quality. Abiotic constraints include extremes in nutrients. temperatures and moisture.

Md.: Entomological Society of America. c1990-,The susceptibility of European corn borer (ECB) to the Bt toxins expressed by transgenic corn has been determined annually since 1995 for populations established from across the US Corn Belt as part of a coordinated resistance monitoring program. Initial assessments were conducted before commercial release of transgenic corn to establish a baseline of susceptibility. From this initial baseline. diagnostic concentrations were designated. Annual assessments of susceptibility have been conducted using both diagnostic bioassays and complete dose response assessments. Although current bioassay-based techniques for resistance detection may be limited in sensitivity. ECB populations appear to remain susceptible to the Cry1Ab toxin which has been available to growers in transgenic hybrids since 1996. However. a population that exhibited higher rates of survival than expected in diagnostic bioassays triggered additional tests to confirm heritable resistance and on-plant survival. These tests indicated that although a relatively high level of resistance to Cry1Ab was present. the resistant insects did not survive on vegetative stage plants and more importantly. there was no indication of increased levels of resistance in subsequent years. One of the biggest limitations of current monitoring efforts has resulted from changes in the source of toxin available for bioassays. As a consequence. we have been developing quantitative techniques to measure toxin concentration and purity. Results indicate considerable variability in toxin potency and in accuracy of various quantitative techniques.

Life-table data were colleted from insecticide-free plots within a 3ha coffee plantation on the upper. medium and lower canopy. Leafminer mortality was similar among the canopy parts but varied in the two seasons studied. During the rainy season. the generational mortality averaged 94.3%. with 50.2. 33.7 and 10.4% occurring during egg. larval and pupal stages. respectively.

However. the genomic information on lepidopteran insects is very limited. Only a few studies have focused on developing expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries from the guts of lepidopteran larvae. Knowledge of the genes that are expressed in the insect gut are crucial for understanding basic physiology of food digestion. their interactions with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins. and for discovering new targets for novel toxins for use in pest management. This study analyzed the ESTs generated from the larval gut of the European corn borer (ECB. Ostrinia nubilalis). one of the most destructive pests of corn in North America and the western world. Our goals were to establish an ECB larval gut-specific EST database as a genomic resource for future research and to explore candidate genes potentially involved in insect-Bt interactions and Bt resistance in ECB.

In this work. the selectivity of 11 insecticides used for management of Leucoptera coffeella (Guérin-Méneville) was studied to Protonectarina sylveirae (Saussure). Polybia scutellaris (White) and Protopolybia exigua (Saussure)(Hymenoptera: Vespidae). The insecticides were applied in concentrations corresponding to 50% and 100% of the field rates used for management of L. coffeella. The organophosphates (except to the 50% rate of ethion to P. scutellaris) were highly toxic to all three Vespidae species. Cartap was highly toxic to P. escutellaris and P. exigua but showed median selectivity to P. sylveirae. The pyrethroids cypermethrin. deltamethrin. betacyfluthrin. zetacypermethrin. and esfenvalerate were selective to at least one of wasp species. The mortality of P. scutelaris caused by ethion. cypermethrin. deltamethrin. betacyfluthrin and zetacypermethrin decreased when 50% of the recommended rates were used. This reduction was also observed for the mortality of P. exigua by permethrin and for the mortality of P. sylveirae by deltamethrin. P. sylveirae was the most tolerant species to cartap; P. scutellaris was the most tolerant to ethion. while P. exigua was more tolerant to pyrethroids than P. scutellaris and P. sylveirae. The results of this research indicate that pyrethroid insecticides are likely to be selective to predatory wasps in field settings given their overall selectivity in the conditions of extreme exposure of this study.

1141676,Pesticide resistance in arthropods,2012,Richard Roush and Bruce E Tabashnik,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Bruce E. Tabashnik and Richard T. Roush Pesticide resistance is an increasingly urgent worldwide problem. Resistance to one or more pesticides has been documented in more than 440 species of insects and mites. Resistance in vectors of human dise8se. particularly malaria-transmit ting mosquitoes. is a serious threat to public health in many nations. Agricultural productivity is jeopardized because of widespread resistance in crop and livestock pests. Serious resistance problems are also evident in pests of the urban environ ment. most notably cockroaches. Better understanding of pesticide resistance is needed to devise techniques for managing resistance (Le.. slowing. preventing. or reversing development of resistance in pests and promoting it in beneficial natural enemies). At the same time. resistance is a dramatic example of evolution. Knowledge of resistance can thus provide fundamental insights into evolution. genetics. physiology. and ecology. Resistance management can help to reduce the harmful effects of pesticides by decreasing rates of pesticide use and prolonging the efficacy of environmentally safe pesticides. In response to resistance problems. the concentration or frequency of pesticide applications is often increased. Effective resistance management would reduce this type of increased pesticide use. Improved monitoring of resis tance would also decrease the number of ineffective pesticide applications that are made when a resistance problem exists but has not been diagnosed. Resistance often leads to replacement of one pesticide with another that is more expensive and less compatible with alternative controls.,True,P4K9F0cAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C,507,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ooHjBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA7&dq=info:JPJmAVvpwewJ:scholar.google.com&ots=b5AT_Vc1DM&sig=szx7GZAXzfkQ94z80mrB2gpZFwc,17060173440530969124,/scholar?cites=17060173440530969124,,,0,0,0

All commercially available cultivars of these crops carry only a single Bt gene. and are particularly at risk where the targeted insect pests are not highly sensitive to the Bt toxin used. Under such circumstances. the most prudent method of avoiding resistance is to ensure that a large proportion of the pest population develops on non–transgenic ‘refuge’ hosts. generally of the crop itself.

For almost as long. entomologists have discussed the importance of genetics and the possibility of genetic manipulations in biological control. and today these remain subjects of considerable debate. Perhaps the first issue raised was that predators and parasites might be artificially selected for improved performance in the field (46. 47. 59). In contrast. a major concern for laboratory rearing of insects and mites used in biological control is that such rearing will promote genetic adaptation to laboratory conditions and thus worsen performance in the field (57. 58). Another concern is that natural enemies imported for biological control constitute only a limited sample of the genetic variation present in the species. and may therefore lack the ability to adapt to their new environment (64. 65).,True,P4K9F0cAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,358,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.en.38.010193.000331,2390186274310415836,/scholar?cites=2390186274310415836,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith_Hopper/publication/234065433_Management_of_Genetics_of_Biological-Control_Introductions/links/0deec52b4d03bdb9d7000000.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd,A list of often‐discussed resistance management tactics is critically reviewed. Alteration of insecticides across generations. non‐persistent formulations. and the use of pesticides conferring only low magnitudes of resistance seem to be among the most promising tactics for general use in resistance management. Justifying the first two choices usually requires little more than data on product persistence in terms of toxic effect on susceptible individuals under field conditions. The last tactic requires additional information on resistance ratios for resistant and susceptible genotypes under field exposure. The efficacy of pesticide mixtures is highly dependent on equal persistence of both compounds used in the mixture.

The sprayed potato crop surrounded a rural agricultural community where residences were within 200 meters of the sprayed fields. Modeling pesticide spray drift is critical for exposure assessment of the residential population. Herein the objective is to model spray drift deposition with regard to model selection. calibration. and prediction for a particular application event.

However. the evolution of resistance could cut short these benefits. A primary pest targeted by Bt maize in the United States is the western corn rootworm Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae).   Methodology/Principal Findings We report that fields identified by farmers as having severe rootworm feeding injury to Bt maize contained populations of western corn rootworm that displayed significantly higher survival on Cry3Bb1 maize in laboratory bioassays than did western corn rootworm from fields not associated with such feeding injury. In all cases. fields experiencing severe rootworm feeding contained Cry3Bb1 maize. Interviews with farmers indicated that Cry3Bb1 maize had been grown in those fields for at least three consecutive years. There was a significant positive correlation between the number of years Cry3Bb1 maize had been grown in a field and the survival of rootworm populations on Cry3Bb1 maize in bioassays. However. there was no significant correlation among populations for survival on Cry34/35Ab1 maize and Cry3Bb1 maize. suggesting a lack of cross resistance between these Bt toxins.

We tested if glandular trichomes in Datura wrightii. a trait that confers resistance to several species of herbivorous insects. impose an ecological cost by decreasing rates of predation by the natural enemies of herbivores. For two common herbivores of D. wrightii.

As costs of Bt resistance are common. refuges of non-Bt host plants can delay resistance not only by providing susceptible individuals to mate with resistant individuals. but also by selecting against resistance. Because costs typically vary across host plants. refuges with host plants that magnify costs or make them less recessive could enhance resistance management. Limited understanding of the physiological mechanisms causing fitness costs. however. hampers attempts to increase costs. In several major cotton pests including pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella). resistance to Cry1Ac cotton is associated with mutations altering cadherin proteins that bind this toxin in susceptible larvae. Here we report that the concentration of gossypol. a cotton defensive chemical. was higher in pink bollworm larvae with cadherin resistance alleles than in larvae lacking such alleles. Adding gossypol to the larval diet decreased larval weight and survival. and increased the fitness cost affecting larval growth. but not survival. Across cadherin genotypes. the cost affecting larval growth increased as the gossypol concentration of larvae increased.

We evaluated whether the application of entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum to soybean seeds could become endophytic and affect interactions with soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura). It was found that A. glycines population sizes increased on plants with M. brunneum (strain F52) seed inoculum. but no significant effects were shown with analogous treatments with B. bassiana (strain GHA). Fungi recovered from soybean plant tissues indicate that endophytism was established. and that B. bassiana was more prevalent. Metarhizium brunneum was only recovered from stems. but B. bassiana was recovered from stems and leaves. This work confirms that some entomopathogenic fungi can be endophytic in soybean. however. some of these fungi may have a negative effect on the plants by increasing susceptibility of soybean to A. glycines.

Predators belonging to a variety of orders and families are known to feed on pollen and nectar. and adult parasitoids acquire nutrients from honeydew and floral and extrafloral nectar.

The present volume. in contrast. presents primarily the enemies’ perspective. and as such is the first comprehensive review of the nut-tional importance of non-prey foods for insect predators and parasitoids. Although the ecological significance of feeding on non-prey foods has long been underappreciated. attempts have been made to manipulate nectar and pollen ava-ability in crop fields in order to enhance levels of biological pest control by natural enemies (van Emden. 1965; Hagen. 1986; Coll. 1998a).

We performed meta-analyses on a modified public database to synthesize current knowledge about the effects of Bt cotton. maize and potato on the abundance and interactions of arthropod non-target functional guilds.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe compared the abundance of predators. parasitoids. omnivores. detritivores and herbivores under scenarios in which neither. only the non-Bt crops. or both Bt and non-Bt crops received insecticide treatments. Predators were less abundant in Bt cotton compared to unsprayed non-Bt controls. As expected. fewer specialist parasitoids of the target pest occurred in Bt maize fields compared to unsprayed non-Bt controls. but no significant reduction was detected for other parasitoids. Numbers of predators and herbivores were higher in Bt crops compared to sprayed non-Bt controls. and type of insecticide influenced the magnitude of the difference. Omnivores and detritivores were more abundant in insecticide-treated controls and for the latter guild this was associated with reductions of their predators in sprayed non-Bt maize. No differences in abundance were found when both Bt and non-Bt crops were sprayed. Predator-to-prey ratios were unchanged by either Bt crops or the use of insecticides; ratios were higher in Bt maize relative to the sprayed non-Bt control.Conclusions/SignificanceOverall. we find no uniform effects of Bt cotton. maize and potato on the functional guilds of non-target arthropods.

We begin by defining soil quality/soil health (which we consider to be interchangeable terms). characterizing healthy soil resources. and relating the significance of soil health to agroecosystems and their functions. We examine how soil biology influences soil health and how biological properties and processes contribute to sustainability of agriculture and ecosystem services. We continue by examining what can be done to manipulate soil biology to:(i) increase nutrient availability for production of high yielding. high quality crops;(ii) protect crops from pests. pathogens. weeds; and (iii) manage other factors limiting production. provision of ecosystem services. and resilience to stresses like droughts. Next we look to the future by asking what needs to be known about soil biology that is not currently recognized or fully understood and how these needs could be addressed using emerging research tools. We conclude. based on our perceptions of how new knowledge regarding soil biology will help make agriculture more sustainable and productive. by recommending research emphases that should receive first priority through enhanced public and private research in order to reverse the trajectory toward global soil degradation.

1141786,Extrapolating non-target risk of Bt crops from laboratory to field,2010,Jian J Duan and Jonathan G Lundgren and Steve Naranjo and Michelle Marvier,6,Biology letters,1,74-77,The Royal Society,The tiered approach to assessing ecological risk of insect-resistant transgenic crops assumes that lower tier laboratory studies. which expose surrogate non-target organisms to high doses of insecticidal proteins. can detect harmful effects that might be manifested in the field. To test this assumption. we performed meta-analyses comparing results for non-target invertebrates exposed to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry proteins in laboratory studies with results derived from independent field studies examining effects on the abundance of non-target invertebrates. For Lepidopteran-active Cry proteins. laboratory studies correctly predicted the reduced field abundance of non-target Lepidoptera. However. laboratory studies incorporating tri-trophic interactions of Bt plants. herbivores and parasitoids were better correlated with the decreased field abundance of parasitoids than were direct-exposure assays.

We examined how the oviposition behaviour of zoophytophagous Orius insidiosus and the subsequent longevity of its progeny are influenced by the physical structure and internal anatomy of five plant species. Female O. insidiosus oviposit into plant species with the thinnest layers of epidermal and collenchyma cells. a decision that is significantly correlated with the survival of their offspring. Once a plant species is chosen. the female mainly bases her oviposition decisions on epidermal thickness and the surface density of hair-like appendages on the plants.

Regenerative farming systems provided greater ecosystem services and profitability for farmers than an input-intensive model of corn production. Pests were 10-fold more abundant in insecticide-treated corn fields than on insecticide-free regenerative farms. indicating that farmers who proactively design pest-resilient food systems outperform farmers that react to pests chemically.

Bees require nectar and pollen floral resources that provide necessary carbohydrates. proteins. lipids. and micronutrients for survival. reproduction. and resilience to stress. However. nectar and pollen nutritional quality varies widely among host-plant species. which in turn influences how bees forage to obtain their nutritionally appropriate diets. Unfortunately. we know little about the nutritional requirements of different bee species.

The associational resistance and enemies hypotheses predict that increasing plant diversity in agricultural fields will reduce pest abundance and damage. Ample research has supported these hypotheses by demonstrating that increased plant species diversity can improve insect pest management via bottom–up and top–down mechanisms. In spite of this support. diversification strategies that might contribute to improved pest control and yield have not been widely adopted owing to logistical and financial constraints.

Ongoing work in our laboratory has focused on the salivary secretions of the tomato fruitworm. Helicoverpa zea. In previous studies we have shown that saliva and its principal component glucose oxidase acts as an effector by suppressing defenses in tobacco. In this current study. we report that saliva elicits a burst of jasmonic acid (JA) and the induction of late responding defense genes such as proteinase inhibitor 2 (Pin2). Transcripts encoding early response genes associated with the JA pathway were not affected by saliva. We also observed a delayed response to saliva with increased densities of Type VI glandular trichomes in newly emerged leaves. Proteomic analysis of saliva revealed glucose oxidase (GOX) was the most abundant protein identified and we confirmed that it plays a primary role in the induction of defenses in tomato. These results suggest that the recognition of GOX in tomato may represent a case for effector-triggered immunity.

Moreover. more eggs resulted in higher pin2 expression in leaves. and both fertilized and unfertilized eggs induced pin2 expression. Notably. when quantified daily following deposition of eggs. pin2 expression at the oviposition site was highest just before the emergence of larvae. Furthermore. H. zea oviposition primed the wound-induced increase of pin2 transcription and a burst of jasmonic acid (JA); tomato plants previously exposed to H. zea oviposition showed significantly stronger induction of pin2 and higher production of JA upon subsequent simulated herbivory than without oviposition.

Varieties containing the Rag1 soybean aphid resistance gene have been released with limited success in reducing aphid populations. Furthermore. virulent biotypes occur within North America and challenge the durability of single-gene resistance. Pyramiding resistance genes has the potential to improve aphid population suppression and increase resistance gene durability. Our goal was to determine if a pyramid could provide improved aphid population suppression across a wide range of environments.

One important group of non-target species is arthropod natural enemies (predators and parasitoids). which contribute considerably to suppression of crop pests. We hypothesized that seed-applied neonicotinoids reduce natural-enemy abundance. but not as strongly as alternative insecticide options such as soil- and foliar-applied pyrethroids. Furthermore we hypothesized that seed-applied neonicotinoids affect natural enemies through a combination of toxin exposure and prey scarcity.To test our hypotheses. we compiled datasets comprising observations from randomized field studies in North America and Europe that compared natural-enemy abundance in plots that were planted with seed-applied neonicotinoids to control plots that were either (1) managed without insecticides (20 studies. 56 site-years. 607 observations) or (2) managed with pyrethroid insecticides (eight studies. 15 site-years. 384 observations). Using the effect size Hedge’s d as the response variable. we used meta-regression to estimate the overall effect of seed-applied neonicotinoids on natural-enemy abundance and to test the influence of potential moderating factors.Seed-applied neonicotinoids reduced the abundance of arthropod natural enemies compared to untreated controls (d = −0.30 ± 0.10 [95% confidence interval]). and as predicted under toxin exposure this effect was stronger for insect than for non-insect taxa (QM = 8 …,True,AAdZM1UAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC,58,https://peerj.com/articles/2776/,16700553309150404604,/scholar?cites=16700553309150404604,,https://peerj.com/articles/2776/,0,0,0

This paper explores how changes in the nature of a one-sided information asymmetry affect effort levels in a Cournot Nash contest. The results indicate that the uninformed player's effort is an uncertain input such that his effort is inversely related to risk. This reduces his average odds of success.

However. the success of genes that confer resistance to pests induces a co-evolutionary response that depreciates the biological capital embodied in the crop. as pests evolve the capacity to overcome the crop's new defences. Thus. simply maintaining this biological capital. and the beneficial production and economic outcomes it bestows. requires continual reinvestment in new crop defences.

We focus on cases in which food safety crises originate from defects in raw material provided by upstream firms to analytically show that high precision can substitute for high intensive contingent payments and vice-versa. and thus traceability is not an unequivocal signal for safer food.

We examine this notion by scrutinizing 2.242 investment evaluations reported in 372 separate studies from 1958 to 2011. We find that the internal rate of return (IRR) is the predominant summary measure of investment performance used in the literature despite methodological criticisms dating back more than a half century.

Rather than use data from small‐plot experiments. this research uses survey data from 500 US farmers to estimate the benefit of neonicotinoid seed treatments to them. As seed treatment users. farmers are familiar with their benefits in the field and have economic incentives to only use them if they provide value.Of the surveyed farmers. 51% used insecticide seed treatments. averaging 87% of their soybean area. Farmers indicated that human and environmental safety is an important consideration affecting their pest management decisions and reported aphids as the most managed and important soybean pest.

Evidence from experimental auctions,2011,Chengyan Yue and Terrance M Hurley and Neil Anderson,42,Agricultural Economics,2,195-205,Blackwell Publishing Inc,Ornamental plant sales have been identified as an important vector for the introduction of invasive plants. Increased concerns about the economic and ecological costs of invasive plants have spawned interest in identifying strategies to curtail introductions. One possible strategy is labeling plants based on whether they are invasive or native. The primary purpose of this paper was to explore how labeling plants based on invasive and native attributes might affect consumer demand. To accomplish this objective. a second price auction was used to elicit the willingness to pay (WTP) for plants with and without labels. On average. we found a $0.35 premium for plants labeled as noninvasive and native and a $1.01 to $1.66 discount for plants labeled as invasive.

We use survey results to explore how adoption of BMPs affects weed-management costs in corn. cotton. and soybeans. controlling for farmer and regional characteristics. More experienced growers had lower weed-control costs. Cleaning equipment. using herbicides with different modes of action. and using supplemental tillage are BMPs associated with increased costs for some crops. which may explain why they are less widely adopted than other BMPs. However. growers commonly use other weed BMPs that also increase costs. Regression results suggest adoption of RR crops reduces weed-control costs and that weed scouting reduces costs for cotton and soybean growers.

Under the assumption that alternative technologies are independent. we develop a hypothetical distribution of multiple technology adoptions. Differences between the observed distribution of technology choices and the hypothetical distribution can be subjected to statistical tests. Combinations of technologies that occur with greater frequency than would occur under independence are complementary technologies. Combinations that occur with less frequency are substitute technologies. This method is easily applied to simultaneous decisions regarding many technologies. We use the strategy to evaluate multiple technology adoptions on US hog farms. We find that some technologies used in pork production are substitutable for one another while others are complementary. However. as the number of bundled technologies increases. they are increasingly likely to be complementary with one another. even if subsets are substitutes when viewed in isolation. This finding suggests that farmers have an incentive to adopt many technologies at once. Larger farms and farms run by more educated operators are the most likely to adopt multiple technologies. The complementarity among technologies in large bundles is contributing to a form of returns to scale that contributes to growth in average farm size.,True,YoGYqr8AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,35,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/48530/,14488932291932167403,/scholar?cites=14488932291932167403,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/48530/files/paper_12983_08026.pdf,0,0,0
1141852,Biotechnology and pest resistance: an economic assessment of refuges,1997,Terrance M Hurley and Bruce A Babcock and Richard L Hellmich,,,1040-2016-85072,,,Biologists now engineer transgenic crop varieties that express proteins that are toxic to a variety of common agricultural pests. These transgenic crops offer farmers a new tool for effectively managing pests that reduce yields and increase production costs. However. the concern over pest resistance to these toxins has prompted the EPA to require resistance management plans. Seed companies have focused on a high-dose refuge plan where farmers are required to plant a constant proportion of cropland in refuge in order to maintain a susceptible pest population. Currently. entomologists recommend 20 to 40% refuge. This paper develops an economic model of pest management with pest resistance to estimate the constant proportion of refuge that maximizes farm income over a fixed planning horizon. Results indicate that there is a clear economic tradeoff between the pest control and population management benefits afforded by a transgenic variety and the resistance management benefits and savings in production costs afforded by refuge. Under certain circumstances a 20 to 40% refuge is economically sensible. However. the optimal proportion of refuge is sensitive to a number of uncertain biological factors: the initial frequency of resistant pests. and the survival rate of resistant and susceptible pests. Additionally. we fiind that when the pest population and resistance develop slowly. the economic losses of a suboptimal proportion of refuge are relatively small; however. the biological consequences in terms of pest susceptibility are very large.,True,YoGYqr8AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,35,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/18632/,5599813831814106820,/scholar?cites=5599813831814106820,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/18632/files/wp970183.pdf,0,0,0

Direct survey methods were used to elicit grower valuation of pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits. We illustrate a hedonic strategy combined with principal component analysis to address part-whole bias present in previous assessments of non-pecuniary benefits of RR crops. Based on a national telephone survey of 1.205 growers. the mean reported benefit of RR relative to conventional seed varieties was more than $20 per acre for corn and soybean growers and about $50 per acre for cotton growers. Growers concerned about weed resistance reported lower benefits. but this effect was statistically significant only for cotton growers. reducing their perceived benefits by about 20% ($10 per acre). Use of a residual herbicide and annual rotation of herbicides are two practices to reduce the risk of weed resistance. Corn growers using residual herbicides perceived lower. though still positive. benefits. Soybean growers rotating herbicides perceived benefits to be higher. Growers more concerned about herbicide application costs and crop safety report lower benefits. while those more concerned about the flexibility of timing herbicide applications report higher RR benefits.,True,YoGYqr8AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,34,https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/handle/10355/6917,15569573156672148600,/scholar?cites=15569573156672148600,,https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/6917/EffectsWeedResistanceConcerns.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

In contrast. X-linked genes are significantly under-represented among testis-expressing genes. This seeming contradiction may be germane to the X:autosome imbalance hypothesis on hybrid sterility. in which the X-linked effect is mediated mainly through the misexpression of autosomal genes. In this study. we compared gene expression in fertile and sterile males in the hybrids between two Drosophila species. These hybrid males differ only in a small region of the X chromosome containing the Ods-site homeobox (OdsH) (also known as Odysseus) locus of hybrid sterility. Of genes expressed in the testis. autosomal genes were. indeed. more likely to be misexpressed than X-linked genes under the sterilizing action of OdsH.

An interesting but contentious issue is whether the underlying molecular biology also converges in the new habitat. Independent invasions of tropical intertidal zones by woody plants. collectively referred to as mangrove trees. represent some dramatic examples. The high salinity. hypoxia. and other stressors in the new habitat might have affected both genomic features and protein structures. Here. we developed a new method for detecting convergence at conservative Sites (CCS) and applied it to the genomic sequences of mangroves.

The Trl gene encodes two alternatively spliced isoforms of the GAGA factor (GAGA-519 and GAGA-581) that are identical except for the length and sequence of the C-terminal glutamine-rich (Q) domain. In vitro and tissue culture experiments failed to find any functional difference between the two isoforms.

To compensate for the resulting disparity in X-linked gene expression between the two sexes. most genes from the male X chromosome are hyperactivated by a special dosage compensation system. Dosage compensation is achieved by a complex of at least six proteins and two noncoding RNAs that specifically associate with the male X. A central question is how the X chromosome is recognized. According to a current model. complexes initially assemble at ∼35 chromatin entry sites on the X and then spread bidirectionally along the chromosome where they occupy hundreds of sites.

The most widely planted rice varieties were developed from a limited number of ancestral lines that were repeatedly used as parents in breeding programs. However. detailed pedigrees are not publicly available and little is known about the genetic. phenotypic. and geographical variation of DPRK varieties. We evaluated 80 O. sativa accessions from the DPRK. consisting of 67 improved varieties and 13 landraces. Based on nuclear SSR analysis. we divide the varieties into two genetic groups: Group 1 corresponds to the temperate japonica subpopulation and represents 78.75% of the accessions. while Group 2 shares recent ancestry with indica varieties. Interestingly. members of Group 1 are less diverse than Group 2 at the nuclear level. but are more diverse at the chloroplast level. All Group 2 varieties share a single Japonica maternal-haplotype. while Group 1 varieties trace maternal ancestry to both Japonica and Indica.

This equilibrium can be achieved either at the single cell level (a.k.a. cell asymmetry). where stem cells follow strict asymmetric divisions. or the population level (a.k.a. population asymmetry). where gains and losses in individual stem cell lineages are randomly distributed. but the net effect is homeostasis. In the mature mouse intestinal crypt. previous evidence has revealed a pattern of population asymmetry through predominantly symmetric divisions of stem cells. In this work. using population genetic theory together with previously published crypt single-cell data obtained at different mouse life stages. we reveal a strikingly dynamic pattern of stem cell homeostatic control.

At the molecular level. despite the small overall magnitude of DNA sequence divergence. we might expect such evolutionary changes to leave a noticeable signature throughout the genome. We here compare 13.731 annotated genes from humans to their chimpanzee orthologs to identify genes that show evidence of positive selection. Many of the genes that present a signature of positive selection tend to be involved in sensory perception or immune defenses. However. the group of genes that show the strongest evidence for positive selection also includes a surprising number of genes involved in tumor suppression and apoptosis. and of genes involved in spermatogenesis. We hypothesize that positive selection in some of these genes may be driven by genomic conflict due to apoptosis during spermatogenesis. Genes with maximal expression in the brain show little or no evidence for positive selection. while genes with maximal expression in the testis tend to be enriched with positively selected genes. Genes on the X chromosome also tend to show an elevated tendency for positive selection. We also present polymorphism data from 20 Caucasian Americans and 19 African Americans for the 50 annotated genes showing the strongest evidence for positive selection. The polymorphism analysis further supports the presence of positive selection in these genes by showing an excess of high-frequency derived nonsynonymous mutations.,True,u8RfnXoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,957,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030170,12633794258003740203,/scholar?cites=12633794258003740203,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030170,0,0,0

Sackton,13,PLOS Biology,4,e1002112,,The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that the amount of neutral polymorphisms within a species will increase proportionally with the census population size (Nc). However. this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude. levels of genetic diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range. Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain this discrepancy. few direct empirical tests of this hypothesis have been conducted. In this work. we provide a direct test of this hypothesis using population genomic data from a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. To do this. we relied on the fact that the impact of natural selection on linked neutral diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. In regions of relatively low recombination. selected variants affect more neutral sites through linkage. and the resulting correlation between recombination and polymorphism allows a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the impact of selection on linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole genome polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling framework. we estimate the degree to which natural selection reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the impact of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc. based on body size and species range as proxies for census population size.

COX passes electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and pumps protons into the inner mitochondrial space for ATP production. Selection on nuclear‐mitochondrial interactions within species should lead to coadaptation of the proteins comprising this important enzyme. Under this model. there should be relatively little disruption of COX activity when mitochondrial genomes are crossed among strains within species. A more pronounced disruption of activity is expected when the mitochondrial genome is expressed in the nuclear background of a different species.

In this study. we measured bacterial load sustained after infection of D. melanogaster with Serratia marcescens. Providencia rettgeri.

We find that genetic polymorphisms in the pathogen recognition genes (and particularly in PGRP-LC. GNBP1. and GNBP2) are most significantly associated with variation in bacterial load. We also find that overall transcriptional induction of effector proteins is a significant predictor of bacterial load after infection with E. faecalis. and that a marker upstream of the recognition gene PGRP-SD is statistically associated with variation in both bacterial load and transcriptional induction of effector proteins.

Here we use 15 Y chromosomes originating from a single founder 550 generations ago to study the role of the Y chromosome in regulating rRNA gene transcription. position-effect variegation (PEV). and the link among rDNA copy number. global gene expression. and chromatin regulation. Based on patterns of rRNA gene transcription indicated by transcription of the retrotransposon R2 that specifically inserts into the 28S rRNA gene. we show that X-linked rDNA is silenced in males.

We use alignments of orthologous protein-coding genes from 39 species of birds to estimate parameters related to positive selection for 11.000 genes conserved across birds. We show that functional pathways related to the immune system. recombination. lipid metabolism. and phototransduction are enriched for positively selected genes. By comparing our results with mammalian data. we find a significant enrichment for positively selected genes shared between taxa. and that these shared selected genes are enriched for viral immune pathways. Using pathogen-challenge transcriptome data. we show that genes up-regulated in response to pathogens are also enriched for positively selected genes.

In the absence of functional annotation. genes encoding immune system proteins can thus be difficult to identify. as homology-based approaches generally cannot detect lineage-specific genes. Here. we use RNA-seq to compare the uninfected and infection-induced transcriptome in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis to identify genes regulated by infection. We identify 183 genes significantly up-regulated by infection and 61 genes significantly down-regulated by infection. We also produce a new homology-based immune catalog in N. vitripennis. and show that most infection-induced genes cannot be assigned an immune function from homology alone. suggesting the potential for substantial novel immune components in less well-studied systems. Finally. we show that a high proportion of these novel induced genes are taxonomically restricted. highlighting the rapid evolution of immune gene content.

Fluctuating asymmetry stress relations are real but are typically weak and difficult to detect. Researchers would like to maximize the probability of detecting FA‐stress relations when they exist. We assert that analyses based on the FA of multiple traits may provide better methods for detecting stress. In this article. we used computer simulations to compare the ability of six analyses to detect differences in FA between stressed and unstressed populations.

Male biases in parasitism existed overall and for tests restricted to arthropod (but not helminth) parasites. We then controlled for potential dependence by choosing single parasite species based on their likelihood of eliciting immune responses.

This hypothesis can be made more general (adaptive changes in patterns of allocation to reproductive functions). but has been largely ignored in the fields of behavioral and evolutionary ecology. In fact. definitive examples of such adaptive responses are lacking. Yet theory on life-history trade-offs predicts that hosts may minimize the impact of parasites by altering their own RE.

Passerine birds have been cited as typically showing high natal philopatry. and natal philopatry has been proposed as an adaptation to promote optimal inbreeding. A review of published and unpublished studies of passerines showed that natal philopatry was typically low. so maintaining a high level of inbreeding appears relatively unimportant for such birds. Rather. natal philopatry appeared to be more strongly influenced by ecological factors. Migratory passerine exhibited low natal philopatry compared to resident passerines. as predicted if dispersal costs for young birds are an important determinant of natal philopatry.

In these species. only the females incubate eggs and attend offspring. First. we examined whether flushing distance by females varied in relation to clutch size. stage of incubation. and time of season. after controlling for the number of visits made to nests by observers. Revisits by observers appeared to affect flushing distance by females for reasons unrelated to the relative value of the current clutch. We found that as incubation progressed. females allowed observers to approach more closely before flushing from the nest. In some species. females with larger clutches allowed closer approaches to nests before flushing which was also consistent with nest defense theory.

This phenomenon could be particularly prevalent in the Acari due to the often intimate interaction these species have with their hosts. In this review. we explore the process of host race formation. whether it is likely to occur in this group and what features may favour its evolution. Although few studies are currently available and tend to be biased toward two model species. results suggest that host races are indeed common in this group. and more likely to occur when hosts are long-lived.

In this study we examine mating behavior in the northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon). a species in which males are much smaller than females despite substantial competition among males to mate.

Approximately one-third of both males and females appeared not to mate in a given year.

Here. we consider another explanation for sexual differences in coloration within species of the damselfly family Coenagrionidae (Odonata: Zygoptera). In many of these species. males are more brightly coloured than females and have different patterns. Yet they are nonterritorial and do not engage in displays: indeed. male competition for mates often resembles a scramble. We therefore argue that even if females show a degree of mate choice. then it is unlikely to be based on colour or pattern. Instead. we suggest that sexual dimorphism has evolved in this group primarily as a form of sex-related warning coloration.

Those models. called random-sites models. are suitable when we do not know a priori which sites are under what kind of selective pressure. Sometimes prior information (such as the tertiary structure of the protein) might be available to partition sites in the protein into different classes. which are expected to be under different selective pressures. It is then sensible to use such information in the model.

The variable selective pressure provided an explanation for the previous observation that the ω ratio is >1 in comparisons of closely related species and <1 in comparisons of distantly related species.

Such reproductive proteins often evolve under positive selection between species; because of this rapid divergence. Sfps are hypothesized to play a role in speciation by contributing to reproductive isolation between populations. In Drosophila. individual Sfps have been characterized and are known to alter male sperm competitive ability and female post-mating behavior. but a proteomic-scale view of the transferred Sfps has been missing. Here we describe a novel proteomic method that uses whole-organism isotopic labeling to detect transferred Sfps in mated female D. melanogaster. We identified 63 proteins. which were previously unknown to function in reproduction. and confirmed the transfer of dozens of predicted Sfps. Relative quantification of protein abundance revealed that several of these novel Sfps are abundant in seminal fluid. Positive selection and tandem gene duplication are the prevailing forces of Sfp evolution. and comparative proteomics with additional species revealed lineage-specific changes in seminal fluid content. We also report a proteomic-based gene discovery method that uncovered 19 previously unannotated genes in D. melanogaster. Our results demonstrate an experimental method to identify transferred proteins in any system that is amenable to isotopic labeling. and they underscore the power of combining proteomic and evolutionary analyses to shed light on the complex process of Drosophila reproduction.,True,yidCdZwAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,288,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060178,1027611748188091802,/scholar?cites=1027611748188091802,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060178,0,0,0

Such a process could leave characteristic signatures at coevolving genes. One signature of coevolution. predicted by sexual selection theory. is an association of alleles between the two genes. Another predicted signature is a correlation of evolutionary rates during divergence due to compensatory evolution. We studied female–male coevolution in the abalone by resequencing sperm lysin and its interacting egg coat protein. VERL. in populations of two species. As predicted. we found intergenic linkage disequilibrium between lysin and VERL. despite our demonstration that they are not physically linked. This finding supports a central prediction of sexual selection using actual genotypes. that of an association between a male trait and its female preference locus. We also created a novel likelihood method to show that lysin and VERL have experienced correlated rates of evolution. These two signatures of coevolution can provide statistical rigor to hypotheses of coevolution and could be exploited for identifying coevolving proteins a priori. We also present polymorphism-based evidence for positive selection and implicate recent selective events at the specific structural regions of lysin and VERL responsible for their species-specific interaction.

These differences were first detected using SNPs genome-wide significantly associated with height. and shown to grow stronger when large numbers of sub-significant SNPs were included. leading to excitement about the prospect of analyzing large fractions of the genome to detect polygenic adaptation for multiple traits. Previous studies of height have been based on SNP effect size measurements in the GIANT Consortium meta-analysis. Here we repeat the analyses in the UK Biobank. a much more homogeneously designed study. We show that polygenic adaptation signals based on large numbers of SNPs below genome-wide significance are extremely sensitive to biases due to uncorrected population stratification.

Many such GWAS involve multiple closely-related phenotypes collected on the same samples.

This is despite the fact that. at least in simulation experiments. multivariate analyses have been shown to be more powerful at detecting associations.

However. the majority of these studies focus on linear additive relationships between genotypic and phenotypic variation. Epistasis. or non-additive genetic interactions. has been identified as a major driver of both complex trait architecture and evolution in multiple model organisms; yet. this same phenomenon is not considered to be a significant factor underlying human complex traits. There are two possible reasons for this assumption. First. most large GWA studies are conducted solely with European cohorts; therefore. our understanding of broad-sense heritability for many complex traits is limited to just one ancestry group. Second. current epistasis mapping methods commonly identify significant genetic interactions by exhaustively searching across all possible pairs of SNPs. In these frameworks. estimated epistatic effects size are often small and power can be low due to the multiple testing burden. Here. we present a case study that uses a novel region-based mapping approach to analyze sets of variants for the presence of epistatic effects across six diverse subgroups within the UK Biobank. We refer to this method as the ""MArginal ePIstasis Test for Regions"" or MAPIT-R.

We developed a novel strategy for designing array-based exon capture in chipmunks (Tamias) based on de novo transcriptome assemblies. We evaluated the performance of our approach across specimens from four chipmunk species. We selectively targeted 11.975 exons (~4 Mb) on custom capture arrays. and enriched over 99% of the targets in all libraries. The percentage of aligned reads was highly consistent (24.4-29.1%) across all specimens. including in multiplexing up to 20 barcoded individuals on a single array. Base coverage among specimens and within targets in each species library was uniform. and the performance of targets among independent exon captures was highly reproducible. There was no decrease in coverage among chipmunk species. which showed up to 1.5% sequence divergence in coding regions. We did observe a decline in capture performance of a subset of targets designed from a much more divergent ground squirrel genome (30 My). however. over 90% of the targets were also recovered.

Here we combine phenotypic data with genome-wide expression data to directly associate aberrant expression patterns with hybrid male sterility between two species of mice. We used a reciprocal cross in which F1 males are sterile in one direction and fertile in the other direction. allowing us to associate expression differences with sterility rather than with other hybrid phenotypes. We found evidence of extensive over-expression of the X chromosome during spermatogenesis in sterile but not in fertile F1 hybrid males. Over-expression was most pronounced in genes that are normally expressed after meiosis. consistent with an X chromosome-wide disruption of expression during the later stages of spermatogenesis. This pattern was not a simple consequence of faster evolutionary divergence on the X chromosome. because X-linked expression was highly conserved between the two species. Thus. transcriptional regulation of the X chromosome during spermatogenesis appears particularly sensitive to evolutionary divergence between species. Overall. these data provide evidence for an underlying regulatory basis to reproductive isolation in house mice and underscore the importance of transcriptional regulation of the X chromosome to the evolution of hybrid male sterility.,True,penpid8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,105,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001148,3945954526068014647,/scholar?cites=3945954526068014647,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001148,0,0,0

Genes expressed early in spermatogenesis had rates of divergence similar to the genome median. while genes expressed after the onset of meiosis were found to evolve much more quickly.

However. hybridization and subsequent gene flow must be relatively common in order to localize individual loci that resist introgression. In this study. we used next-generation sequencing to study genome-wide patterns of genetic differentiation between two hybridizing subspecies of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus and O. c. cuniculus) that are known to undergo high rates of gene exchange. Our primary objective was to identify specific genes or genomic regions that have resisted introgression and are likely to confer reproductive barriers in natural conditions. On the basis of 326.000 polymorphisms. we found low to moderate overall levels of differentiation between subspecies. and fewer than 200 genomic regions dispersed throughout the genome showing high differentiation consistent with a signature of reduced gene flow. Most differentiated regions were smaller than 200 Kb and contained very few genes. Remarkably. 30 regions were each found to contain a single gene. facilitating the identification of candidate genes underlying reproductive isolation.

In mammals. sperm become motile and capable of fertilization only after leaving the testis. during their transit through the epididymis. Thus. genes expressed in the epididymis are expected to play important roles in male fertility. Here. we performed evolutionary genetic analyses on the epididymal transcriptome of mice.

1141994,The ecology of adaptive radiation,2000,Dolph Schluter,,,,,OUP Oxford,Adaptive radiation is the evolution of diversity within a rapidly multiplying lineage. It can cause a single ancestral species to differentiate into an impressively vast array of species inhabiting a variety of environments. Much of life's diversity has arisen during adaptive radiations. Some of the most famous recent examples include the East African cichlid fishes. the Hawaiian silverswords. and of course. Darwin's Gal--aacute--; pagos finches.. This book evaluates the causes of adaptive radiation. It focuses on the'ecological'theory of adaptive radiation. a body of ideas that began with Darwin and was developed through the early part of the 20th Century. This theory proposes that phenotypic divergence and speciation in adaptive radiation are caused ultimately by divergent natural selection arising from differences in environment and competition between species. In The Ecology of Adaptive Radiation the author re-evaluates the ecological theory. along with its most significant extensions and challenges. in the light of all the recent evidence.

These alternative sources of beneficial alleles can result in different evolutionary dynamics and distinct genetic outcomes. Compared with new mutations. adaptation from standing genetic variation is likely to lead to faster evolution. the fixation of more alleles of small effect and the spread of more recessive alleles. There is potential to distinguish between adaptation from standing variation and that from new mutations by differences in the genomic signature of selection.

Mechanisms of speciation by selection fall into two broad categories: ecological and mutation-order. Under ecological speciation. divergence is driven by divergent natural selection between environments. whereas under mutation-order speciation. divergence occurs when different mutations arise and are fixed in separate populations adapting to similar selection pressures. Tests of parallel evolution of reproductive isolation. trait-based assortative mating. and reproductive isolation by active selection have demonstrated that ecological speciation is a common means by which new species arise. Evidence for mutation-order speciation by natural selection is more limited and has been best documented by instances of reproductive isolation resulting from intragenomic conflict.

To answer this question. I focus on gmax. the multivariate direction of greatest additive genetic variance within populations. Original data on threespine sticklebacks. together with published genetic measurements from other vertebrates. show that morphological differentiation between species has been biased in the direction of gmax for at least four million years. despite evidence that natural selection is the cause of differentiation. This bias toward the direction of evolution tends to decay with time.

1142011,Ecological character displacement in adaptive radiation,2000,Dolph Schluter,156,the american naturalist,S4,S4-S16,The University of Chicago Press, I give an overview of the observational and experimental evidence for ecological character displacement in adaptive radiation. Sixty‐one published cases of character displacement involving closely related species (congeners) make up the observational data set. All cases involve divergence. even though parallel and convergent displacement are theoretically possible. Character ratios in sympatry were greatest when displacement was symmetric (mean 1.54) and least when asymmetric (mean 1.29). perhaps because the most symmetric resource distributions are also the broadest. Carnivores are vastly overrepresented in the data compared with other trophic groups. with herbivores the next most common category. I consider five hypotheses to explain this pattern. including the possibility that the likelihood of divergence via competition depends on position in food webs.

1142012,A variance test for detecting species associations. with some example applications,1984,Dolph Schluter,65,Ecology,3,998-1005,Ecological Society of America,A little—used measure of species association is provided by the ratio of the variance in total species number (or total density of individuals) in samples to the sum of the variances of the individual species. Use of this ratio allows a test of the null hypothesis that species do not covary among samples. As the test is simultaneous it is preferable to pairwise 2 X 2 contingency table analysis and pairwise correlation analysis when the number of species is large. Simulation reveals that this test is also more powerful than Pearson's g2 test for comparing observed and expected frequency distributions of species in samples. The variance test was applied to a selection of data from the literature. Results reveal that positive associations are the rule in nature and negative associations are uncommon.

Yet. this ‘ecological’ mode of species origins has been tested rarely in nature. Here I describe emerging evidence of divergent selection and speciation in fishes of postglacial lakes. Examples of very closely related species pairs within such lakes are known from over a dozen independent fish lineages. These pairs display four remarkable attributes which together raise the possibility of ecological speciation: rapid evolution of assortative mating in sympatry and/or allopatry; persistence in sympatry despite a history of gene flow; a high degree of niche differentiation (usually one species is planktivorous and the other is benthic) accompanied by differences in body size and shape; and high intrinsic viability and fertility of interspecific hybrids …,True,ESm6OYYAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,531,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.1996.0075,6398371683768955498,/scholar?cites=6398371683768955498,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dolph_Schluter/publication/247604498_Ecological_Speciation_in_Postglacial_Fishes_Discussion/links/54f45c9b0cf2f9e34f099f53.pdf,0,0,0

A general mechanism by which this occurs is ecological speciation. defined as the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations as a result of ecologically-based divergent natural selection. The alternative mechanism is mutation-order speciation in which populations fix different mutations as they adapt to similar selection pressures. Although numerous cases now indicate the importance of ecological speciation in nature. very little is known about the genetics of the process.

Within the Misty Lake system (Vancouver Island. British Columbia). stickleback from the inlet stream (flowing into the lake) have fewer gill rakers and deeper bodies than stickleback from the lake–differences thought to facilitate foraging (benthic macroinvertebrates in the stream vs. zooplankton in the open water of the lake). Common‐garden experiments demonstrated that these differences have a genetic basis. Reciprocal transplant enclosure experiments showed that lake and inlet stickleback grow best in their home environments (although differences were subtle and often not significant).

1142033,Population structure attributable to reproductive time: isolation by time and adaptation by time,2005,Andrew P Hendry and Troy Day,14,,4,901-916,Blackwell Science Ltd,Many populations are composed of a mixture of individuals that reproduce at different times. and these times are often heritable. Under these conditions. gene flow should be limited between early and late reproducers. even within populations having a unimodal temporal distribution of reproductive activity. This temporal restriction on gene flow might be called ‘isolation by time’ (IBT) to acknowledge its analogy with isolation by distance (IBD). IBD and IBT are not exactly equivalent. however. owing to differences between dispersal in space and dispersal in time. We review empirical studies of natural populations that provide evidence for IBT based on heritabilities of reproductive time and on molecular genetic differences associated with reproductive time.

From the intersection of these two premises follows the prediction that reproductive isolation can evolve on ecological time-scales. We explore this possibility in theory and in nature. Finding few relevant studies. we examine each in some detail. 2. Theory: Several models have demonstrated that ecological differences can drive the evolution of partial reproductive barriers in dozens to hundreds of generations. Barriers likely to evolve quickly include dispersal rate. habitat preference and selection against migrants/hybrids.3.

One involves divergent selection. wherein the maladaptation of immigrants and hybrids impedes gene flow between ecological environments (i.e. ecological speciation). The other involves geographic features that limit dispersal. We determined the relative influence of these two processes in natural populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). If selection is important. gene flow should be reduced between different selective environments. If geography is important. gene flow should be impeded by geographic distance and physical barriers.

The answer to this question should objectively reveal whether gene flow generally places a substantial constraint on evolutionary diversification.

We performed an analysis of such trends across multiple studies. to test for the consistency of life history changes under fishing. and for their association with the intensity of exploitation (fishing mortality rate). We analyzed 143 time series from 37 commercial fish stocks. the majority of which originated from the North Atlantic. Rates of phenotypic change were calculated for two traditional maturation indices (length and age at 50% maturity). as well as for probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs).

In absence of geographical barriers to dispersal. this adaptive divergence (AD) may be constrained by gene flow (GF). And yet the reverse may also be true. with AD constraining GF (i.e. ‘ecological speciation’). Both of these causal effects have frequently been inferred from the presence of negative correlations between AD and GF in nature – yet the bi‐directional causality warrants caution in such inferences. We discuss how the ability of correlative studies to infer causation might be improved through the simultaneous measurement of multiple ecological and evolutionary variables.

We agree that global climate change will have substantial effects on biodiversity and will cause extinctions (Crowley & North 1990; Hoffman et al. 2003). Nevertheless. the climate-envelope approach presents a distorted estimate of extinction probabilities. Most notably. the approach does not consider evolution and therefore implicitly assumes that species cannot evolve in response to changing climate.

In some cases. philopatry can be the simple result of geographic isolation or limited movement ability. In other cases. philopatry can be strong even when migratory movements take individuals far from their natal site. We must therefore seek explanations for philopatry through selective factors that favor return to natal sites rather than non-natal sites. The tendency for philopatry in any population or species is balanced to varying degrees by some dispersal to non-natal sites. with some groups showing high philopatry and low dispersal and others low philopatry and high dispersal. Again. some of this variation may be the result of varying isolation or movement ability. whereas some can only be explained through natural selection. Our goal in the present chapter is to use data from salmonids to evaluate theories for how selection might influence the evolution of philopatry and dispersal. Philopatry can be evaluated at a variety of spatial scales. ranging from precise nest locations to broad geographic areas. We focus on philopatry to spatially discrete locations that are predictably occupied by breeding aggregations. These aggregations often correspond to ‘‘populations’’: groups of individuals that breed together and are at least partially reproductively isolated from other such groups. By ‘‘reproductive isolation.’’we here mean that the different groups are not freely interbreeding within or between generations (ie. not panmictic).

We transplanted marine sticklebacks carrying both alleles to freshwater ponds and tracked genotype frequencies over a generation. The low allele increased in frequency once lateral plates developed. most likely via a growth advantage.

Studies employing genome scans have hypothesized that the action of divergent selection should reduce gene flow at the genomic locations implicated in adaptation and speciation among natural populations. yet once ‘outlier’ patterns of variation have been identified the function and role of such loci needs to be confirmed.

1142052,The role of gene expression in ecological speciation,2010,Scott A Pavey and Hélène Collin and Patrik Nosil and Sean M Rogers,1206,,1,110,Wiley-Blackwell,Ecological speciation is the process by which barriers to gene flow between populations evolve due to adaptive divergence via natural selection. A relatively unexplored area in ecological speciation is the role of gene expression. Gene expression may be associated with ecologically important phenotypes not evident from morphology and play a role during colonization of new environments. Here we review two potential roles of gene expression in ecological speciation:(1) its indirect role in facilitating population persistence and (2) its direct role in contributing to genetically based reproductive isolation. We find indirect evidence that gene expression facilitates population persistence. but direct tests are lacking. We also find clear examples of gene expression having effects on phenotypic traits and adaptive genetic divergence. but links to the evolution of reproductive isolation itself remain indirect.

In prickly sculpin (Cottus asper). an abundant euryhaline fish in northwestern North America. high genetic connectivity among brackish‐water (estuarine) and freshwater (tributary) habitats of coastal rivers does not preclude the build‐up of neutral genetic differentiation and emergence of different life history strategies. Because these two habitats present different osmotic niches. we predicted high genetic differentiation at known teleost candidate genes underlying salinity tolerance and osmoregulation.

1142072,The masterpiece of nature: the evolution and genetics of sexuality,2019,Graham Bell,,,,,Routledge,Originally published in 1982. The Masterpiece of Nature examines sex as representative of the most important challenge to the modern theory of evolution. The book suggests that sex evolved. not as the result of normal Darwinian processes of natural selection. but through competition between populations or species-a hypothesis elsewhere almost universally discredited. The book also discusses the nature of sex and its consequences for the individual and for the population. as well as various other theories of sex. Since the value of these theories is held to reside wholly in their ability to predict the patterns of sexuality observed in nature. the book seeks to provide an extensive review of the circumstances in which sexuality is attenuated or lost throughout the animal kingdom. and these facts are then used to weigh up the merits of the rival theories.

By reproductive cost I mean the generally deleterious effect of present reproduction on future survival or fecundity or both. My approach is first to discover the circumstances in which reproduction at a given age should be maximal. and then to investigate the conditions under which reproduction at given age should be zero; this leads to a discussion first of semelparity and later of the optimal age at maturity. When all entries in the life table are independent of one another there is no reproductive cost. and it can be shown that semelparity is unlikely to evolve if maturity is delayed or if prereproductive survival is poor. The existence of a number of conspicuous exceptions to these rules points to an inadequacy in the model. Once reproductive costs are introduced. reproduction will be optimized rather than being merely …,True,yd0k8xYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,830,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/283611,8677871617386372431,/scholar?cites=8677871617386372431,,http://www.biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/bell/articles/16.Bell_1980_AmerNat116.pdf,0,0,0

A method of calculating the gender of secondary floral allocation is described. and it is speculated that this allocation is predominantly male. Observations and experiments with natural populations of herbs. designed to test this hypothesis gave the following major results. (i) Insects visit larger flowers more frequently (Fragaria). and removal of floral biomass causes a reduction in the frequency of insect visits proportional to the fraction of biomass removed (Impatiens).

1142077,Selection: the mechanism of evolution,2008,Graham Bell,,,,,Oxford University Press on Demand,This book adopts an experimental approach to understanding the mechanisms of evolution and the nature of evolutionary processes. with examples drawn from microbial. plant and animal systems. It incorporates insights from remarkable recent advances in theoretical modeling. and the fields of molecular genetics and environmental genomics. Adaptation is caused by selection continually winnowing the genetic variation created by mutation. In the last decade. our knowledge of how selection operates on populations in the field and in the laboratory has increased enormously. and the principal aim of this book is to provide an up-to-date account of selection as the principal agent of evolution. In the classical Fisherian model. weak selection acting on many genes of small effect over long periods of time is responsible for driving slow and gradual change. However. it is now clear that adaptation in laboratory populations often involves strong selection acting on a few genes of large effect. while in the wild selection is often strong and highly variable in space and time. Indeed these results are changing our perception of how evolutionary change takes place. This book summarizes our current understanding of the causes and consequences of selection. with an emphasis on quantitative and experimental studies. It includes the latest research into experimental evolution. natural selection in the wild. artificial selection. selfish genetic elements. selection in social contexts. sexual selection. and speciation.

Diversity is described by species number S and the variance of frequency or log abundance q∼. The frequency distribution of abundance is very generally lognormal. skewed to the left by immigration and resembling descriptions of natural communities. Increased immigration and community size always cause S to increase. Their effect on q∼ is more complicated. but given biologically reasonable assumptions. S and q∼ will be positively correlated in most circumstances. Larger samples contain more species; the graph of log S on log individuals. equivalent to a species‐area curve. is generally convex upward but becomes linear with a slope of about +0.25 when immigration is low and births exceed deaths.

In many cases. environmental change is so widespread and rapid that individuals can neither accommodate to them physiologically nor migrate to a more favourable site. Extinction will ensue unless the population adapts fast enough to counter the rate of decline. According to theory. whether populations can be rescued by evolution depends upon several crucial variables: population size. the supply of genetic variation. and the degree of maladaptation to the new environment. Using techniques in experimental evolution we tested the conditions for evolutionary rescue (ER). Hundreds of yeast populations were exposed to normally lethal concentrations of salt in conditions. where the frequency of rescue mutations was estimated and population size was manipulated.

We tracked the eco-evolutionary dynamics of metapopulations with a laboratory model system of yeast exposed to salt stress. Metapopulations experienced environmental deterioration at three different rates and their component populations were either unconnected or connected by local dispersal or by global dispersal. We found that adaptation was favored by gradual deterioration and local dispersal.

This leads to strong but fluctuating selection in many natural populations.2. The effect of repeated adverse change on mean fitness depends on its frequency rather than its severity.

The cost of natural selection expresses the limited capacity of a population to sustain the load of mortality or sterility required for effective selection. Genostasis expresses the lack of variation that prevents many populations from adapting to stress. While the role of relative fitness in adaptation is well understood. evolutionary rescue emphasizes the need to recognize explicitly the importance of absolute fitness. Permanent adaptation requires a range of genetic variation in absolute fitness that is broad enough to provide a few extreme types capable of sustained growth under a stress that would cause extinction if they were not present.

The thermal physiology of a species is a key determinant of range but the impact of thermal trait evolution on SDMs has not been addressed. We identified a genetic basis for physiological traits that evolve in response to temperature change in threespine stickleback. Using these data. we created geographic range projections under two climate change scenarios where trait data was either static (‘no evolution’ model). allowed to evolve in agreement with published evolutionary rates for the trait (‘evolution’ model). or allowed to evolve with the rate of evolution scaled in association with the variance that is explained by QTL (‘PVE’ model). Here. we show that incorporating these traits and their evolution into SDMs substantially altered the predicted ranges for a widespread panmictic marine population. with increases in area of over 7-fold.

However. few studies have investigated the process of parallel selection as it plays out in real time. The common approach is to study historical signatures of selection in populations already well adapted to different environments. Here. to document selection in action under natural conditions. we study six populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) inhabiting bar-built estuaries that undergo seasonal cycles of environmental changes. Estuaries are periodically isolated from the ocean due to sandbar formation during dry summer months. with concurrent environmental shifts that resemble the long-term changes associated with postglacial colonization of freshwater habitats by marine populations. We used pooled whole-genome sequencing (Pool-WGS) to track seasonal allele frequency changes in these populations and search for signatures of natural selection. We found consistent changes in allele frequency across estuaries. suggesting a potential role for parallel selection. Functional enrichment among candidate genes included transmembrane ion transport and calcium binding. which are important for osmoregulation and ion balance. The genomic changes that occur in threespine stickleback from bar-built estuaries could provide a glimpse into the early stages of adaptation that have occurred in many historical marine to freshwater transitions.,True,8WiOIKEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.396291v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/11/25/2020.11.24.396291.full.pdf,0,0,0
1142110,"The evolution of quantitative traits in reponse to drought in"" Arabidopsis lyrata""",2013,Antoine Paccard,,,,,,In spite of the great advances in population genetic and quantitative genetics over the last decades. many central questions of these fields are still not satisfactorily answered. In particular. we still have a poor understanding of how species are limited in their adaptation to changing environmental conditions and to habitats present beyond their natural distribution. In addition. our knowledge about the effect of habitat heterogeneity on the maintenance of genetic variation remains poor. In the context of global climate changes. many species will have to respond to different environmental conditions in order to survive. Therefore. understanding species’ ability to adapt and how high levels of the genetic variance necessary for adaptation can be maintained within populations is highly important. Such knowledge will be very useful for building new conservation strategies.During this thesis I have investigated these questions using the Arabidospsis lyrata plant system. Its ability to grow on different substrates and the development of comprehensive genomic resources makes it a powerful system for studying adaptation. Several seed families occurring in a heterogeneous landscape and across two latitudinal clines in North America were raised in a common garden environment and in two different treatments: wet and dry. By measuring several traits all related to drought adaptation and by performing intense linear and multivariate statics.

To date. high capacity. low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via “SNP chip” microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability. and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants. a major source of information for both population history and genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping. but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption.

1142113,The locus of evolution: evo devo and the genetics of adaptation,2007,Hopi E Hoekstra and Jerry A Coyne,61,,5,995-1016,Blackwell Publishing Inc,An important tenet of evolutionary developmental biology (“evo devo”) is that adaptive mutations affecting morphology are more likely to occur in the cis‐regulatory regions than in the protein‐coding regions of genes. This argument rests on two claims: (1) the modular nature of cis‐regulatory elements largely frees them from deleterious pleiotropic effects. and (2) a growing body of empirical evidence appears to support the predominant role of gene regulatory change in adaptation. especially morphological adaptation. Here we discuss and critique these assertions. We first show that there is no theoretical or empirical basis for the evo devo contention that adaptations involving morphology evolve by genetic mechanisms different from those involving physiology and other traits. In addition. some forms of protein evolution can avoid the negative consequences of pleiotropy. most notably via gene duplication.

Here we identify genetic changes contributing to an adaptive difference in color pattern between two subspecies of oldfield mice (Peromyscus polionotus). One mainland subspecies has a cryptic dark brown dorsal coat. while a younger beach-dwelling subspecies has a lighter coat produced by natural selection for camouflage on pale coastal sand dunes. Using genome-wide linkage mapping. we identified three chromosomal regions (two of major and one of minor effect) associated with differences in pigmentation traits. Two candidate genes. the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r) and its antagonist. the Agouti signaling protein (Agouti). map to independent regions that together are responsible for most of the difference in pigmentation between subspecies. A derived mutation in the coding region of Mc1r. rather than change in its expression level. contributes to light pigmentation. Conversely. beach mice have a derived increase in Agouti mRNA expression but no changes in protein sequence. These two genes also interact epistatically: the phenotypic effects of Mc1r are visible only in genetic backgrounds containing the derived Agouti allele.

Using plasticine mouse models of light and dark color. we demonstrate a strong selective advantage for mice that match their local background substrate. Further our data suggest that stabilizing selection maintains color matching within a single habitat. as models that are both lighter and darker than their local environment are selected against. These results provide empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that visual hunting predators shape color patterning in Peromyscus mice and suggest a mechanism by which selection drives the pronounced color variation among populations.,True,-iLn_XwAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,154,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.00976.x,11077219953503972129,/scholar?cites=11077219953503972129,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.00976.x,0,0,0

For instance. in ecological character displacement. coexisting species evolve to use different resources. reducing the effects of interspecific competition. It is thought that a similar diversifying effect might occur in response to competition among members of a single species. Individuals may mitigate the effects of intraspecific competition by switching to use alternative resources not used by conspecific competitors. This diversification is the driving force in some models of sympatric speciation. but has not been demonstrated in natural populations.

(3) strongly discontinuous variation with strong but reversible reproductive isolation and (4) complete and irreversible reproductive isolation.

Most populations exist in state 1. even though some of these show evidence of disruptive selection and positive assortative mating. Transitions to state 2 seem to usually involve strong divergent selection coupled with at least a bit of geographic separation. such as parapatry (e.g. lake and stream pairs and mud and lava pairs) or allopatry (e.g. different lakes).

However. predators can also reduce prey densities by forcing prey to adopt costly defensive strategies.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe build on a simple Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model to provide a heuristic tool for distinguishing between the demographic effects of consumption (consumptive effects) and of anti-predator defenses (nonconsumptive effects). and for distinguishing among the multiple mechanisms by which anti-predator defenses might reduce prey population growth rates. We illustrate these alternative pathways for nonconsumptive effects with selected empirical examples. and use a meta-analysis of published literature to estimate the mean effect size of each pathway. Overall. predation risk tends to have a much larger impact on prey foraging behavior than measures of growth. survivorship. or fecundity.Conclusions/SignificanceWhile our model provides a concise framework for understanding the many potential NCE pathways and their relationships to each other. our results confirm empirical research showing that prey are able to partially compensate for changes in energy income. mitigating the fitness effects of defensive changes in time budgets. Distinguishing the many facets of nonconsumptive effects raises some novel questions. and will help guide both empirical and theoretical studies of how predation risk affects prey dynamics.,True,cfwxm0AAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,214,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002465,809695151660432968,/scholar?cites=809695151660432968,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002465,0,0,0

However. the actual rate at which this clock ticks is poorly known. Most speciation‐clock studies have used genetic divergence as a proxy for time. adopting a molecular clock and often far‐distant calibration points to convert genetic distances into age. Because molecular clock assumptions are violated for most genetic datasets and distant calibrations are of questionable utility. the actual rate at which reproductive isolation evolves may be substantially different than current estimates suggest. We provide a robust measure of the tempo at which hybrid viability declines with divergence time in a clade of freshwater fishes (Centrarchidae).

However. disruptive selection could also lead to other forms of evolutionary diversification. including ecological sexual dimorphisms. Using a model of frequency‐dependent intraspecific competition. we show analytically that adaptive speciation and dimorphism require identical ecological conditions. Numerical simulations of individual‐based models show that a single ecological model can produce either evolutionary outcome. depending on the genetic independence of male and female traits and the potential strength of assortative mating. Speciation is inhibited when the genetic basis of male and female ecological traits allows the sexes to diverge substantially.

These methods have led to considerable new insights. but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day species distributions. Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the distributions of species within a clade. this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity.

We studied cryptically colored deer mice living on the Nebraska Sand Hills and show that their light coloration stems from a novel banding pattern on individual hairs produced by an increase in Agouti expression caused by a cis-acting mutation (or mutations). which either is or is closely linked to a single amino acid deletion in Agouti that appears to be under selection.

Color variation in an admixed population suggests that this light Sand Hills phenotype is composed of multiple traits. We identified distinct regions within the Agouti locus associated with each color trait and found that only haplotypes associated with light trait values have evidence of selection.

Following such a genome scan. individual regions may be chosen for further sequencing and a more detailed analysis of patterns of variability. often to perform a parametric test for selection and to estimate the strength of a recent selective sweep. We show here that not accounting for the ascertainment of loci in such analyses leads to false inference of natural selection when the true model is selective neutrality. because the procedure of choosing unusual loci (in comparison to the rest of the genome-scan data) selects regions of the genome with genealogies similar to those expected under models of recent directional selection.

To understand HCMV evolution. longitudinally sampled genomic populations from the urine and plasma of 5 infants with symptomatic congenital HCMV infection were analyzed. Temporal and compartmental variability of viral populations were quantified using high throughput sequencing and population genetics approaches. HCMV populations were generally stable over time. with ∼88% of SNPs displaying similar frequencies. However. samples collected from plasma and urine of the same patient at the same time were highly differentiated with approximately 1700 consensus sequence SNPs (1.2% of the genome) identified between compartments. This inter-compartment differentiation was comparable to the differentiation observed in unrelated hosts. Models of demography (i.e.. changes in population size and structure) and positive selection were evaluated to explain the observed patterns of variation. Evidence for strong bottlenecks (>90% reduction in viral population size) was consistent among all patients. From the timing of the bottlenecks. we conclude that fetal infection occurred between 13–18 weeks gestational age in patients analyzed. while colonization of the urine compartment followed roughly 2 months later. The timing of these bottlenecks is consistent with the clinical histories of congenital HCMV infections.

Here. we make these connections using a combination of field and laboratory experiments. We conduct a large-scale manipulative field experiment with wild populations of deer mice in distinct habitats to directly estimate natural selection on pigmentation traits and next test whether this selection drives changes in allele frequency at an underlying pigment locus. We find that divergent cryptic phenotypes are repeatedly favoured in each habitat. leaving footprints of selection in the Agouti gene. Next. using transgenic experiments in Mus. we functionally test one of the Agouti mutations associated with survival. a Serine deletion in exon 2. and find that it causes lighter coat colour via changes in its protein binding properties.

Recent work has suggested that a DNA-based identification system. founded on the mitochondrial gene. cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI). can aid the resolution of this diversity. While past work has validated the ability of COI sequences to diagnose species in certain taxonomic groups. the present study extends these analyses across the animal kingdom. The results indicate that sequence divergences at COI regularly enable the discrimination of closely allied species in all animal phyla except the Cnidaria. This success in species diagnosis reflects both the high rates of sequence change at COI in most animal groups and constraints on intraspecific mitochondrial DNA divergence arising. at least in part. through selective sweeps mediated via interactions with the nuclear genome.,True,VScbxfoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,4843,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2003.0025,12385386575460654610,/scholar?cites=12385386575460654610,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1698023/pdf/12952648.pdf,0,0,0

Compiling a public library of DNA barcodes linked to named specimens could provide a new master key for identifying species. one whose power will rise with increased taxon coverage and with faster. cheaper sequencing. Recent work suggests that sequence diversity in a 648-bp region of the mitochondrial gene. cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). might serve as a DNA barcode for the identification of animal species. This study tested the effectiveness of a COI barcode in discriminating bird species. one of the largest and best-studied vertebrate groups. We determined COI barcodes for 260 species of North American birds and found that distinguishing species was generally straightforward. All species had a different COI barcode(s). and the differences between closely related species were. on average. 18 times higher than the differences within species. Our results identified four probable new species of North American birds. suggesting that a global survey will lead to the recognition of many additional bird species. The finding of large COI sequence differences between. as compared to small differences within. species confirms the effectiveness of COI barcodes for the identification of bird species. This result plus those from other groups of animals imply that a standard screening threshold of sequence difference (10× average intraspecific difference) could speed the discovery of new animal species.

By assigning individuals to presumptive species. called operational taxonomic units (OTUs). these systems speed investigations into the patterning of biodiversity and enable studies that would otherwise be impossible. Although OTUs have conventionally been separated through their morphological divergence. DNA-based delineations are not only feasible. but have important advantages. OTU designation can be automated. data can be readily archived. and results can be easily compared among investigations. This study exploits these attributes to develop a persistent. species-level taxonomic registry for the animal kingdom based on the analysis of patterns of nucleotide variation in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene.

It may be difficult in practice. however. to retrieve a 650 bp fragment from archival specimens. (because of DNA degradation) or from environmental samples (where universal primers are needed).

To satisfy this need. analytical facilities must adopt protocols that can support the rapid. cost-effective assembly of barcodes. In this paper we discuss the prospects for establishing high volume DNA barcoding facilities by evaluating key steps in the analytical chain from specimens to barcodes. Alliances with members of the taxonomic community represent the most effective strategy for provisioning the analytical chain with specimens.

Stochastic processes in small populations. increased mutation load. and the phenomenon of mutational meltdown are compounding factors that cause reduced fitness and accelerate the process of population extirpation.

Although this is the dominant paradigm for species in fragmented habitats. empirical support is limited. and it has been argued that very restrictive conditions on migration rates are required: high enough for recolonization to balance extinctions. but low enough that local populations do not fluctuate in synchrony. Through simulation and analysis of a stochastic spatial model. we argue that the likelihood of persistence via the classical scenario is strongly affected by some basic properties of within‐patch successional dynamics whose importance has not been emphasized in metapopulation theory: the distribution of successional stage durations. and whether patches are “refractory” vs. immediately available for …,True,7_maK-oAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,85,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0882:EOSDOM]2.0.CO;2,8350034399771539246,/scholar?cites=8350034399771539246,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ddfe/0ab483ac94d1335d985836907f6588481c5f.pdf,0,0,0

1142250,Estimating a predator‐prey dynamical model with the parameter cascades method,2008,Jiguo Cao and Gregor F Fussmann and James O Ramsay,64,Biometrics,3,959-967,Blackwell Publishing Inc, Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used in ecology to describe the dynamical behavior of systems of interacting populations. However. systems of ODEs rarely provide quantitative solutions that are close to real field observations or experimental data because natural systems are subject to environmental and demographic noise and ecologists are often uncertain about the correct parameterization. In this article we introduce “parameter cascades” as an improved method to estimate ODE parameters such that the corresponding ODE solutions fit the real data well. This method is based on the modified penalized smoothing with the penalty defined by ODEs and a generalization of profiled estimation. which leads to fast estimation and good precision for ODE parameters from noisy data.

Experiments have shown that this will have important effects on the physiology and ecology of photosynthetic organisms. but it is still unclear if elevated CO2 will elicit an evolutionary response in primary producers that causes changes in physiological and ecological attributes. In this study. we cultured lines of seven species of freshwater phytoplankton from three major groups at current (approx. 380 ppm CO2) and predicted future conditions (1000 ppm CO2) for over 750 generations. We grew the phytoplankton under three culture regimes: nutrient-replete liquid medium. nutrient-poor liquid medium and solid agar medium. We then performed reciprocal transplant assays to test for specific adaptation to elevated CO2 in these lines. We found no evidence for evolutionary change.

Elimination of a parasite should thus cause the evolution of reduced resistance to that parasite. To test this prediction in nature. we studied the fourth- and eighth-generation descendants of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) introduced into four natural streams following experimental elimination of a common and deleterious parasite (Gyrodactylus spp.). After two generations of laboratory rearing to control for plasticity and maternal effects. we infected individual fish to assess their resistance to the parasite. Contrary to theoretical expectations. the introduced guppy populations had rapidly and repeatably evolved increased resistance to the now-absent parasite.

Even at the highest densities. however. populations never become entirely mictic: i.e.. some amictic females continue to be produced. Surprisingly. the phenomenon also occurs in clonal laboratory populations with genetically identical individuals. Here. we study how this ecologically adaptive phenomenon is generated at the level of individual reproducing females. In a life-history experiment we subjected 123 amictic females of a clone of B. calyciflorus separately to a daily renewed stimulus of culture medium conditioned at a density of 30 females ml−1.

The chapter presents the initial model formulation and the minor adjustments needed to obtain qualitative agreement with the dynamic patterns revealed by the experimental data. It introduces theoretical evidence that the cyclical algal-rotifer dynamics observed could not result from classical predator–prey interaction alone but that some additional biology is needed to explain the observed population oscillations.

The present study examines the mRNA expression of two recently discovered α-subunit isoforms of Na+/K+-ATPase (α1a and α1b) in gill during the seawater acclimation of three species of anadromous salmonids. which vary in their salinity tolerance. Levels of these Na+/K+-ATPase isoforms were compared with Na+/K+-ATPase activity and protein abundance and related to the seawater tolerance of each species. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) quickly regulated plasma Na+.

Here I provide a brief summary of existing definitions of the term stress. and the related concepts of homeostasis and allostasis. and attempt to unify them to develop a general framework for understanding how organisms respond to environmental stressors. I suggest that viewing stressors as environmental changes that cause reductions in performance or fitness provides the broadest and most useful conception of the phenomenon of stress.

These tissues are functionally similar in seawater. but in freshwater the gills actively absorb Na+ but not Cl–. whereas the opercular epithelium actively absorbs Cl– but not Na+. These differences in freshwater physiology are likely due to differences in absolute levels of gene expression (measured using real-time PCR). as several proteins important for Na+ transport. namely Na+.H+-exchanger 2 (NHE2). carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2).

We propose that biodiversity provides spatial insurance for ecosystem functioning by virtue of spatial exchanges among local systems in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore this hypothesis by using a simple theoretical metacommunity model with explicit local consumer–resource dynamics and dispersal among systems. Our model shows that variation in dispersal rate affects the temporal mean and variability of ecosystem productivity strongly and nonmonotonically through two mechanisms: spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species that tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates. and functional compensations between …,True,nxg3KqkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,796,https://www.pnas.org/content/100/22/12765.short,10108996806765364788,/scholar?cites=10108996806765364788,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/100/22/12765.full.pdf,0,0,0

In many cases. environmental change is so widespread and rapid that individuals can neither accommodate to them physiologically nor migrate to a more favourable site. Extinction will ensue unless the population adapts fast enough to counter the rate of decline. According to theory. whether populations can be rescued by evolution depends upon several crucial variables: population size. the supply of genetic variation. and the degree of maladaptation to the new environment. Using techniques in experimental evolution we tested the conditions for evolutionary rescue (ER).

Theory and evidence suggest that the loss or decline of stress-intolerant species can be compensated for by the growth of other species. Compensatory dynamics are a long-term feature of community dynamics across a broad range of models. and they can have strong stabilizing effects at the community level. Coexistence theory indicates that distinct environmental responses are required for compensatory dynamics and deemphasizes competition. Compensatory dynamics have been detected under experimental conditions. but are not dominant in a metanalysis of field surveys. Recent progress has been made in quantitative methods that detect compensatory dynamics at different temporal scales. Appropriate null models are required to sharpen our understanding of compensatory dynamics in nature.

We tracked the eco-evolutionary dynamics of metapopulations with a laboratory model system of yeast exposed to salt stress. Metapopulations experienced environmental deterioration at three different rates and their component populations were either unconnected or connected by local dispersal or by global dispersal. We found that adaptation was favored by gradual deterioration and local dispersal. After further abrupt deterioration. the frequency of evolutionary rescue depended on both the prior rate of deterioration and the rate of dispersal. Adaptation was surprisingly frequent and rapid in small peripheral populations. Thus. evolutionary dynamics affect both the persistence and the range of a species after environmental deterioration.,True,nxg3KqkAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,314,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6035/1327.abstract,14555305500243585745,/scholar?cites=14555305500243585745,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Gonzalez/publication/51207094_Adaptation_and_Evolutionary_Rescue_in_Metapopulations_Experiencing_Environmental_Deterioration/links/582a0c7108ae138f1bf30ec3/Adaptation-and-Evolutionary-Rescue-in-Metapopulations-Experiencing-Environmental-Deterioration.pdf,0,0,0

One possible way of achieving this is by establishing corridors of suitable habitat between reserves. Using moss patches as model microecosystems. we provide here probably the first field experimental test of the idea that corridors can reduce the rate of loss of species. and therefore help to maintain species richness. Connecting patches of habitat with corridors did indeed slow the rate of extinction of species. preserving species richness for longer periods of time than in disconnected habitat patches.

Faced with the prospect of a massive. irreversible loss of biodiversity. ecologists have begun investigating the potential consequences of these dramatic changes in biodiversity for the functioning of natural and managed ecosystems. These investigations have been motivated by both the scientific challenge and the need to understand better the role biodiversity plays in providing sustainable ecological goods and services for human societies. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that changes in biodiversity can have adverse effects on the average rates of ecosystem processes such as primary production and nutrient retention in temperate grassland ecosystems (see chapters by Hector et al.. Chapter 4. Tilman et al.. Chapter 3; Wardle and van der Putten. Chapter 14). Most of this evidence. however. comes from relatively short-term experimental studies (see. however. Petchey et al.. Chapter 11) under controlled experimental conditions. which are little informative about sustainable functioning. The temporal variability of natural environments over a broad spectrum of time scales from days to centuries (Halley 1996). as well as increasing anthropogenic pressures (Sala et al. 2000). inevitably generate temporal changes in both population sizes and ecosystem processes.

Generally. the greater the magnitude. or variance. of environmental stochasticity. the greater the risk of population extinction.

This is important because real environmental variables. such as temperature. are reddened or positively temporally autocorrelated. However. recent work has disagreed about the effect of reddening environmental stochasticity.

We identified 365. 313. and 741 differentially …,True,B3KgjEEAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,18,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.14771,6331125385481972575,/scholar?cites=6331125385481972575,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juntao_Hu3/publication/325430660_Genome-wide_DNA_methylation_signatures_of_infection_status_in_Trinidadian_guppies_Poecilia_reticulata/links/5b8c83bd4585151fd144723f/Genome-wide-DNA-methylation-signatures-of-infection-status-in-Trinidadian-guppies-Poecilia-reticulata.pdf,0,0,0
1142316,Heritable gene expression differences between lake and stream stickleback include both parallel and antiparallel components,2017,D Hanson and J Hu and AP Hendry and RDH Barrett,119,Heredity,5,339-348,Nature Publishing Group,The repeated phenotypic patterns that characterize populations undergoing parallel evolution provide support for a deterministic role of adaptation by natural selection. Determining the level of parallelism also at the genetic level is thus central to our understanding of how natural selection works. Many studies have looked for repeated genomic patterns in natural populations. but work on gene expression is less common. The studies that have examined gene expression have found some support for parallelism. but those studies almost always used samples collected from the wild that potentially confounds the effects of plasticity with heritable differences. Here we use two independent pairs of lake and stream threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) raised in common garden conditions to assess both parallel and antiparallel (that is. similar versus different directions of lake–stream expression divergence in …,True,B3KgjEEAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC,12,https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy201750,9705656813153903715,/scholar?cites=9705656813153903715,,https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy201750,0,0,0
1142317,The Epigenetic Signature of Colonizing New Environments in Anolis Lizards,2019,Juntao Hu and Arash M Askary and Timothy J Thurman and Dave A Spiller and Todd M Palmer and Robert M Pringle and Rowan DH Barrett,36,Molecular biology and evolution,10,2165-2170,Oxford University Press,Founder populations often show rapid divergence from source populations after colonizing new environments. Epigenetic modifications can mediate phenotypic responses to environmental change and may be an important mechanism promoting rapid differentiation in founder populations. Whereas many long-term studies have explored the extent to which divergence between source and founder populations is genetically heritable versus plastic. the role of epigenetic processes during colonization remains unclear. To investigate epigenetic modifications in founding populations. we experimentally colonized eight small Caribbean islands with brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) from a common source population. We then quantitatively measured genome-wide DNA methylation in liver tissue using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of individuals transplanted onto islands with high- versus low-habitat …,True,B3KgjEEAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC,5,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/36/10/2165/5506638,14545243041684334032,/scholar?cites=14545243041684334032,,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/10/2165/5506638,0,0,0

Bactrocera dorsalis and Bactrocera correcta,2019,Xinyue Gu and Yan Zhao and Yun Su and Jiajiao Wu and Ziya Wang and Juntao Hu and Lijun Liu and Zihua Zhao and Ary A Hoffmann and Bing Chen and Zhihong Li,12,Evolutionary applications,6,1147-1163,,Many insects have the capacity to increase their resistance to high temperatures by undergoing heat hardening at nonlethal temperatures. Although this response is well established. its molecular underpinnings have only been investigated in a few species where it seems to relate at least partly to the expression of heat shock protein (Hsp) genes. Here. we studied the mechanism of hardening and associated transcription responses in larvae of two invasive fruit fly species in China. Bactrocera dorsalis and Bactrocera correcta. Both species showed hardening which increased resistance to 45°C. although the more widespread B. dorsalis hardened better at higher temperatures compared to B. correcta which hardened better at lower temperatures. Transcriptional analyses highlighted expression changes in a number of genes representing different biochemical pathways. but these changes and pathways were …,True,B3KgjEEAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC,3,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eva.12793,2115701617202776921,/scholar?cites=2115701617202776921,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/eva.12793,0,0,0
