Although GORD is primarily a motor disorder. the injurious effects of gastric acid are central to the pathogenic process of oesophagitis. and the severity of disease correlates with the degree and duration of oesophageal acid exposure. In the majority of patients with mild disease. oesophageal acid exposure occurs predominantly during post-prandial periods. Conventional doses of H2-receptor antagonists cannot overcome the integrated stimulus to acid secretion resulting from a meal. and are thus relatively ineffective in preventing daytime. post-prandial oesophageal acid exposure. In patients with more severe grades of oesophagitis. there are abnormally high levels of nocturnal acid exposure. with the intra-oesophageal pH being less than 4.0 for 36% of the time. compared …,True,71oArqMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,683,https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/200917,3198294505263657045,/scholar?cites=3198294505263657045,,,0,0,0

The relationship between degree of acid suppression and therapeutic efficacy has not been precisely defined for these drugs. We have examined the association between suppression of intragastric acidity and duodenal ulcer healing rates for a number of therapeutic regimens. For the H2 receptor antagonists alone. the most significant correlation with healing rates was with suppression of intragastric acidity at night (r = 0.926; p = 0.0001). When other classes of drug: high dose antacid. omeprazole and a synthetic prostaglandin (enprostil) were included in the analysis. the closest correlation was with suppression of total 24 hour intragastric acidity (r = 0.911; p less than F0.0001).

Dyspepsia has not been defined adequately and current definitions include a variety of symptoms that probably reflect a number of underlying pathophysiological processes. Dyspepsia is a symptom complex. rather than a specific disease entity. and cannot be easily identified. There are probably many causes of dyspepsia. and if H. pylori does cause symptoms. it may produce different symptoms in different people. However. little is known about variations in host susceptibility and H. pylori virulence. or their potential effect on symptomatology.

RECOMMENDATIONS: The management tool has 5 key decision steps addressing the following:(1) evidence that symptoms originate in the upper gastrointestinal tract.(2) presence of alarm features.(3) use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).(4) dominant reflux symptoms and (5) evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection. All patients over 50 years of age who present with new-onset dyspepsia and patients who present with alarm features should receive prompt investigation. preferably by endoscopy. The management options for patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia who use NSAIDs regularly are:(1) to stop NSAID therapy and assess symptomatic response.(2) to treat with NSAID prophylaxis if NSAID therapy cannot be stopped or (3) to refer for investigation. Gastroesophageal reflux disease can be diagnosed clinically if the patient's dominant symptoms are heartburn or acid regurgitation. or both; these patients should be treated with acid suppressive therapy. The remaining patients should be tested for H. pylori infection. and those with a positive result should be treated with H. pylori-eradication therapy.

The parallel outputs that CMOS imagers can offer. in addition to complete camera-on-a-chip solutions due to being fabricated in standard CMOS technologies. result in compelling advantages in speed and system throughput. Since there is a practical limit on the minimum pixel size (4~ 5 μm) due to limitations in the optics. CMOS technology scaling can allow for an increased number of transistors to be integrated into the pixel to improve both detection and signal processing. Such smart pixels truly show the potential of CMOS technology for imaging applications allowing CMOS imagers to achieve the image quality and global shuttering performance necessary to meet the demands of ultrahigh-speed applications. In this paper. a review of CMOS-based high-speed imager design is presented and the various implementations that target ultrahigh-speed imaging are described. This work also discusses the design. layout and simulation results of an ultrahigh acquisition rate CMOS active-pixel sensor imager that can take 8 frames at a rate of more than a billion frames per second (fps).

Within the GI tract. the microbiota have a mutually beneficial relationship with their host that maintains normal mucosal immune function. epithelial barrier integrity. motility. and nutrient absorption. Disruption of this relationship alters GI function and disease susceptibility.

1103552,Is irritable bowel syndrome a low-grade inflammatory bowel disease?,2005,Premysl Bercik and Elena F Verdu and Stephen M Collins,34,,2,235-245,Elsevier,The influence of the immune system on gastrointestinal (GI) function has long been recognized. The work has focused mainly on the effect of overt inflammation on GI motility. Studies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have shown that colonic inflammation reduces basal contractile activity in the distal colon. which. under physiologic conditions. slows fecal stream [1]. Other studies have reported that intestinal inflammation alters responsiveness of the colonic motor system to a meal [2] and to pharmacologic stimulation [3].

Ltd,The gut–brain axis is the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. which occurs through multiple pathways that include hormonal. neural and immune mediators. The signals along this axis can originate in the gut. the brain or both. with the objective of maintaining normal gut function and appropriate behaviour. In recent years. the study of gut microbiota has become one of the most important areas in biomedical research. Attention has focused on the role of gut microbiota in determining normal gut physiology and immunity and. more recently. on its role as modulator of host behaviour (‘microbiota–gut–brain axis’). We therefore review the literature on the role of gut microbiota in gut homeostasis and link it with mechanisms that could influence behaviour.

The disease is triggered by the ingestion of gluten. and a lifelong. strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only currently available treatment. Compliance with a strict GFD is essential not only for intestinal mucosal recovery and alleviation of symptoms. but also for the prevention of complications such as anemia. osteoporotic fractures and small bowel lymphoma. However. a GFD is difficult to follow. socially inconvenient and expensive. Different approaches. such as tax reduction. cash transfer. food provision. prescription and subsidy. have been used to reduce the additional costs of the GFD to patients with celiac disease. The current review showed that the systems in place exhibit particular advantages and disadvantages in relation to promoting uptake and compliance with GFD. The tax offset system used in Canada for GFD coverage takes the form of a reimbursement of a cost previously incurred. Hence. the program does not help celiac patients meet the incremental cost of the GFD – it simply provides some future refund of that cost. An ideal balanced approach would involve subsidizing gluten-free products through controlled vouchers or direct food provision to those who most need it. independently of ‘ability or willingness to pay’. Moreover. if the cost of such a program is inhibitive. the value of the benefits could be made taxable to ensure that any patient contribution. in terms of additional taxation. is directly related to ability to pay. The limited coverage of GFD in Canada is concerning. There is an unmet need for GFD …,True,37DpmAkAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,27,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjgh/2015/508156/abs/,4792612958089737953,/scholar?cites=4792612958089737953,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cjgh/2015/508156.pdf,0,0,0

Although GORD is primarily a motor disorder. the injurious effects of gastric acid are central to the pathogenic process of oesophagitis. and the severity of disease correlates with the degree and duration of oesophageal acid exposure. In the majority of patients with mild disease. oesophageal acid exposure occurs predominantly during post-prandial periods. Conventional doses of H2-receptor antagonists cannot overcome the integrated stimulus to acid secretion resulting from a meal. and are thus relatively ineffective in preventing daytime. post-prandial oesophageal acid exposure. In patients with more severe grades of oesophagitis. there are abnormally high levels of nocturnal acid exposure. with the intra-oesophageal pH being less than 4.0 for 36% of the time. compared …,True,KTgUKUcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,683,https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/200917,3198294505263657045,/scholar?cites=3198294505263657045,,,0,0,0

When data are not available that will withstand objective scrutiny. a recommendation may be made based on a consensus of experts. Guidelines are intended to apply to the clinical situation for all physicians without regard to specialty. Guidelines are intended to be flexible. not necessarily indicating the only acceptable approach. and should be distinguished from standards of care that are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of choices in any health care problem. the physician should select the course best suited to the individual patient and the clinical situation presented. These guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its practice parameters committee. These guidelines are also approved by the governing boards of the American Gastroenterological Association. the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Expert opinion is solicited from the outset for the document. Guidelines are reviewed in depth by the committee. with participation from experienced clinicians and others in related fields.

All proton pump inhibitors must undergo acid accumulation in the parietal cell through protonation. followed by activation mediated by a second protonation at the active secretory canaliculus of the parietal cell.The relative ease with which these steps occur with different proton pump inhibitors underlies differences in their rates of activation. which in turn influence the location of covalent binding and the stability of inhibition. Slow activation is associated with binding to a cysteine residue involved in proton transport that is located deep in the membrane. However. this is inaccessible to the endogenous reducing agents responsible for restoring H+/K+‐ATPase activity. favouring a longer duration of gastric acid inhibition.

1103612,Clinical pharmacology of omeprazole,1991,Colin W Howden,20,,1,38-49,Springer International Publishing,Omeprazole is a specific inhibitor of H+. K+-ATPase or ‘proton pump’ in parietal cells. This enzyme is responsible for the final step in the process of acid secretion; omeprazole blocks acid secretion in response to all stimuli. Single doses produce dose-dependent inhibition with increasing effect over the first few days. reaching a maximum after about 5 days. Doses of omeprazole 20mg daily or greater are able to virtually abolish intragastric acidity in most individuals. although lower doses have a much more variable effect. Omeprazole causes a dose-dependent increase in gastrin levels.Omeprazole must be protected from intragastric acid when given orally. and is therefore administered as encapsulated enteric-coated granules.

To facilitate the interpretation of these findings. we have created a dedicated online resource. PDGene. that comprehensively collects and meta-analyzes all published studies in the field. A systematic literature screen of ∼27.000 articles yielded 828 eligible articles from which relevant data were extracted. In addition. individual-level data from three publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were obtained and subjected to genotype imputation and analysis. Overall. we performed meta-analyses on more than seven million polymorphisms originating either from GWAS datasets and/or from smaller scale PD association studies. Meta-analyses on 147 SNPs were supplemented by unpublished GWAS data from up to 16.452 PD cases and 48.810 controls. Eleven loci showed genome-wide significant (P<5×10−8) association with disease risk: BST1. CCDC62/HIP1R. DGKQ/GAK. GBA. LRRK2. MAPT. MCCC1/LAMP3. PARK16. SNCA. STK39. and SYT11/RAB25. In addition. we identified novel evidence for genome-wide significant association with a polymorphism in ITGA8 (rs7077361. OR 0.88. P = 1.3×10−8).

Within the GI tract. the microbiota have a mutually beneficial relationship with their host that maintains normal mucosal immune function. epithelial barrier integrity. motility. and nutrient absorption. Disruption of this relationship alters GI function and disease susceptibility. Animal studies suggest that perturbations of behavior. such as stress. can change the composition of the microbiota; these changes are associated with increased vulnerability to inflammatory stimuli in the GI tract.

1103662,The role of CD4+ lymphocytes in the susceptibility of mice to stress-induced reactivation of experimental colitis,1999,BS Qiu and BA Vallance and PA Blennerhassett and SM Collins,5,Nature medicine,10,1178-1182,Nature Publishing Group,Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic relapsing condition. The role of stress in causing relapses of inflammatory bowel disease remains controversial. We now show that colitis induced in mice by dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS) resolves by 6 weeks. but can subsequently be reactivated by stress plus a sub-threshold dose of DNBS. but not by DNBS alone. Stress reduced colonic mucin and increased colon permeability. Susceptibility to reactivation by stress required CD4+ lymphocytes and could be adoptively transferred. We conclude that stress reactivates experimental colitis by facilitating entry of luminal contents that activate previously sensitized CD4 cells in the colon.,True,hizZXhYAAAAJ:KNjnJ3z-R6IC,304,https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1099_1178,5642753300606377903,/scholar?cites=5642753300606377903,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bruce_Vallance/publication/12797266_The_role_of_CD4_lymphocytes_in_the_stress-induced_reactivation_of_experimental_colitis/links/09e41505b33cc594e6000000.pdf,0,0,0

1103665,A role for the gut microbiota in IBS,2014,Stephen M Collins,11,,8,497,Nature Publishing Group,The past decade has witnessed an explosion of knowledge regarding the vast microbial community that resides within our intestine—the gut microbiota. The topic has generated great expectations in terms of gaining a better understanding of disorders ranging from IBD to metabolic disorders and obesity. IBS is a condition for which investigators have long been in search of plausible underlying pathogeneses and it is inevitable that altered composition or function of the gut microbiota will be considered as a potential aetiological factor in at least a subset of patients with IBS. This Review describes the evidence implicating the gut microbiota in not only the expression of the intestinal manifestations of IBS. but also the psychiatric morbidity that coexists in up to 80% of patients with IBS.

In this paper. the authors present some of the recent developments in the methodology for conducting systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies. Restrictive electronic search filters are discouraged. as is the use of summary quality scores. Methods for meta-analysis should take into account the paired nature of the estimates and their dependence on threshold. Authors of these reviews are advised to use the hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic or the bivariate model for the data analysis.

However. to find out whether new tests are better than TST is difficult because of the lack of a gold standard test for latent infection. We developed and assessed a sensitive enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay to detect T cells specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens that are absent from Mycobacterium bovis BCG and most environmental mycobacteria. We postulated that if the ELISPOT is a more accurate test of latent infection than TST. it should correlate better with degree of exposure to M tuberculosis.A large tuberculosis outbreak in a UK school resulted from one infectious index case. We tested 535 students for M tuberculosis infection with TST and ELISPOT.

However. concerns have been raised about the unthinking use of league tables and some authors have questioned the theoretical basis of their construction. In this paper a recently-reported league table is scrutinized and the important methodological features of the source studies identified.

Guidelines are viewed as useful tools for making care more consistent and efficient and for closing the gap between what clinicians do and what scientific evidence supports.

Should policymakers attempt to influence clinical behavior and correct for these inefficiencies? Implementation methods achieve a certain level of behavioral change but cost money to enact.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Although the epidemiology of malignant bone tumours in children and young adults has been explored. no definitive causation of any specific tumour has yet been identified. We performed a literature review (1970–2008) to find all papers covering possible aetiological factors involved in the development of bone tumours in children and young adults. Several associations have been reported with some consistency: the presence of hernias and Ewing sarcoma; high fluoride exposure and osteosarcoma; and parental farming and residence on a farm. younger age at puberty and family history of cancer for all bone tumours. especially osteosarcoma. Clearly further research is needed to confirm or refute these putative risk factors. It is likely that studies of gene–environment interactions may prove to be the most fruitful of future research.

This included questions related to treatment. disease status. other long-term conditions (LTCs). generic HRQL (EuroQol-5D). and cancer-specific outcomes (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy and Social Difficulties Inventory items). Results The response rate was 63.3%(21.802 of 34.467 patients). One or more generic health problems were reported by 65% of respondents. with 10% of patients reporting problems in all five domains.

1103770,Childhood obesity. prevalence and prevention,2005,Mahshid Dehghan and Noori Akhtar-Danesh and Anwar T Merchant,4,,1,1-8,BioMed Central,Childhood obesity has reached epidemic levels in developed countries. Twenty five percent of children in the US are overweight and 11% are obese. Overweight and obesity in childhood are known to have significant impact on both physical and psychological health. The mechanism of obesity development is not fully understood and it is believed to be a disorder with multiple causes. Environmental factors. lifestyle preferences. and cultural environment play pivotal roles in the rising prevalence of obesity worldwide. In general. overweight and obesity are assumed to be the results of an increase in caloric and fat intake. On the other hand. there are supporting evidence that excessive sugar intake by soft drink. increased portion size. and steady decline in physical activity have been playing major roles in the rising rates of obesity all around the world. Consequently. both over-consumption of calories and reduced physical activity are involved in childhood obesity. Almost all researchers agree that prevention could be the key strategy for controlling the current epidemic of obesity. Prevention may include primary prevention of overweight or obesity. secondary prevention or prevention of weight regains following weight loss. and avoidance of more weight increase in obese persons unable to lose weight. Until now. most approaches have focused on changing the behaviour of individuals in diet and exercise. It seems. however. that these strategies have had little impact on the growing increase of the obesity epidemic.

Adequacy of use takes into account the timing of initiation of prenatal care and the number of visits. However. there is emerging evidence that the quality of prenatal care may be more important than adequacy of use. The purpose of our study was to explore women's and care providers' perspectives of quality prenatal care to inform the development of items for a new instrument. the Quality of Prenatal Care Questionnaire. We report on the derivation of themes resulting from this first step of questionnaire development. A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 pregnant women and 40 prenatal care providers recruited from five urban centres across Canada.

Accurate construction of such genetic maps requires multipoint linkage analysis of particular types of pedigrees. We describe here a computer package. called MAPMAKER. designed specifically for this purpose. The program uses an efficient algorithm that allows simultaneous multipoint analysis of any number of loci. MAPMAKER also includes an interactive command language that makes it easy for a geneticist to explore linkage data.

As marker density increases and indirect approaches are used to assess association through linkage disequilibrium. association is now frequently considered at the haplotypic level. We suggest that there are difficulties in replicating association findings at the single-nucleotide–polymorphism (SNP) or the haplotype level. and we propose a shift toward a gene-based approach in which all common variation within a candidate gene is considered jointly. Inconsistencies arising from population differences are more readily resolved by use of a gene-based approach rather than either a SNP-based or a haplotype-based approach.

Traditionally. genetic correlations between complex traits are estimated from pedigree studies. but such estimates can be confounded by shared environmental factors.

Here we analyzed summary statistics from 56 complex traits (average N= 101.401) by extending stratified LD score regression to continuous annotations. We determined that SNPs with low LLD have significantly larger per-SNP heritability and that roughly half of this effect can be explained by functional annotations negatively correlated with LLD. such as DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs). The remaining signal is largely driven by our finding that more recent common variants tend to have lower LLD and to explain more heritability (P= 2.38× 10− 104); the youngest 20% of common SNPs explain 3.9 times more heritability than the oldest 20%. consistent with the action of negative selection.

We review this literature. with a particular emphasis on molecular genetic studies. Family. twin. and adoption studies provide compelling evidence that genes play a strong role in mediating susceptibility to ADHD. This fact is most clearly seen in the 20 extant twin studies. which estimate the heritability of ADHD to be .76. Molecular genetic studies suggest that the genetic architecture of ADHD is complex. The few genome-wide scans conducted thus far are not conclusive. In contrast. the many candidate gene studies of ADHD have produced substantial evidence implicating several genes in the etiology of the disorder.

A Wiley Company,Family. twin. and adoption studies have been essential in defining the genetic epidemiology of bipolar disorder over the past several decades. Family studies have documented that first‐degree relatives of affected individuals have an excess risk of the disorder. while twin studies (and to a lesser extent. adoption studies) suggest that genes are largely responsible for this familial aggregation. We review these studies. including the magnitude of familial risk and heritability estimates. efforts to identify familial subtypes of bipolar disorder. and the implications of family/genetic data for validating nosologic boundaries.

The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics. but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred. a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding. particularly at large sample sizes.

As part of the Genetic Association Information Network initiative of the US Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. we conducted a genome-wide association study of 435 291 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 1738 MDD cases and 1802 controls selected to be at low liability for MDD. Of the top 200. 11 signals localized to a 167 kb region overlapping the gene piccolo (PCLO. whose protein product localizes to the cytomatrix of the presynaptic active zone and is important in monoaminergic neurotransmission in the brain) with P-values of 7.7× 10− 7 for rs2715148 and 1.2× 10− 6 for rs2522833.

However. genome-wide investigation of the contribution of CNV to risk has been hampered by limited sample sizes. We sought to address this obstacle by applying a centralized analysis pipeline to a SCZ cohort of 21.094 cases and 20.227 controls. A global enrichment of CNV burden was observed in cases (odds ratio (OR)= 1.11. P= 5.7× 10− 15). which persisted after excluding loci implicated in previous studies (OR= 1.07. P= 1.7× 10− 6). CNV burden was enriched for genes associated with synaptic function (OR= 1.68. P= 2.8× 10− 11) and neurobehavioral phenotypes in mouse (OR= 1.18. P= 7.3× 10− 5).

1104002,The genetics of bipolar disorder,2009,Jennifer H Barnett and Jordan W Smoller,164,,1,331-343,Pergamon,Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by impairing episodes of mania and depression. Twin studies have established that bipolar disorder is among the most heritable of medical disorders and efforts to identify specific susceptibility genes have intensified over the past two decades. The search for genes influencing bipolar disorder has been complicated by a paucity of animal models. limited understanding of pathogenesis. and the genetic and phenotypic complexity of the syndrome. Linkage studies have implicated several chromosomal regions as harboring relevant genes. but results have been inconsistent. It is now widely accepted that the genetic liability to bipolar disorder reflects the action of many genes of individually small effect. a scenario for which linkage studies are poorly suited. Thus. association studies. which are more powerful for the detection of modest effect loci. have become the focus …,True,wj6_m0kAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,415,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452209005764,13217647146096409823,/scholar?cites=13217647146096409823,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3637882/,0,0,0
