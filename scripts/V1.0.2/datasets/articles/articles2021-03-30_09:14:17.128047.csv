Here. we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets. that is. groups of genes that share common biological function. chromosomal location. or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets. including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably. where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer. GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.

Here. a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases.

Accurate construction of such genetic maps requires multipoint linkage analysis of particular types of pedigrees. We describe here a computer package. called MAPMAKER. designed specifically for this purpose. The program uses an efficient algorithm that allows simultaneous multipoint analysis of any number of loci.

This multistep process is well illustrated by colorectal cancers. which typically develop over decades and appear to require at least seven genetic events for completion. Even so. inheritance of a single altered gene can result in a marked predisposition to colorectal cancer in two distinct syndromes. Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC). Recent evidence suggests that the genetic defect in FAP affects the rate of tumor initiation by targeting the gatekeeper function of the APC gene.

However. emerging evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) represent one important source of these cells. As we discuss here. processes similar to the EMTs associated with embryo implantation. embryogenesis. and organ development are appropriated and subverted by chronically inflamed tissues and neoplasias.

Massachusetts 02142 pRB. the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene. operates in the midst of the cell cycle clock apparatus. Its main role is to act as a signal transducer connecting the cell cycle clock with the transcriptional machinery. In this role. pRB allows the clock to control the expression of banks of genes that mediate advance of the cell through a critical phase of its growth cycle. Loss of pRB function deprives the clock and thus the cell of an important mechanism for braking cell proliferation through modulation of gene expression. pRB and the G1 Restriction Point pRB exerts most and perhaps all of its effects in a defined window of time in the first two thirds of the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

In a search for key regulators of metastasis in a murine breast tumor model. we have found that the transcription factor Twist. a master regulator of embryonic morphogenesis. plays an essential role in metastasis. Suppression of Twist expression in highly metastatic mammary carcinoma cells specifically inhibits their ability to metastasize from the mammary gland to the lung. Ectopic expression of Twist results in loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. activation of mesenchymal markers. and induction of cell motility. suggesting that Twist contributes to metastasis by promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

Building on new mechanistic insights emerging from recent research. we offer our perspective on the metastatic process and reflect on possible paths of future exploration. We suggest that metastasis can be portrayed as a two-phase process: The first phase involves the physical translocation of a cancer cell to a distant organ. whereas the second encompasses the ability of the cancer cell to develop into a metastatic lesion at that distant site. Although much remains to be learned about the second phase. we feel that an understanding of the first phase is now within sight. due in part to a better understanding of how cancer cell behavior can be modified by a cell-biological program called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.,True,1wq5H9oAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,3735,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6024/1559.abstract,11566479261151166999,/scholar?cites=11566479261151166999,,https://eclass.duth.gr/modules/document/file.php/ALEX01166/A%20Perspective%20on%20Cancer%20Cell%20Metastasis.pdf,0,0,0

Using a coimplantation tumor xenograft model. we demonstrate that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) extracted from human breast carcinomas promote the growth of admixed breast carcinoma cells significantly more than do normal mammary fibroblasts derived from the same patients. The CAFs. which exhibit the traits of myofibroblasts. play a central role in promoting the growth of tumor cells through their ability to secrete stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1); CAFs promote angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into carcinomas. an effect mediated in part by SDF-1.

Treatment of mice with RSV significantly increased their aerobic capacity. as evidenced by their increased running time and consumption of oxygen in muscle fibers. RSV's effects were associated with an induction of genes for oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis and were largely explained by an RSV-mediated decrease in PGC-1α acetylation and an increase in PGC-1α activity.

Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication. followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications. giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25.498 genes encoding proteins from 11.000 families. similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans-the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families. indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes.

1228740,The genetical theory of natural selection,1958,Ronald Aylmer Fisher,,,,,Рипол Классик,ATURAL Selection is not Evolution. Yet. ever since the two words have been in common use. the theory of Natural Selection has been employed as a convenient abbreviation for the theory of Evolution by means of Natural Selection. put forward by Darwin and Wallace. This has had the unfortunate consequence that the theory of Natural Selection itself has scarcely ever. if ever. received separate consideration. To draw a physical analogy. the laws of conduction of heat in solids might be deduced from the principles of statistical mechanics. yet it would have been an unfortunate limita-tion. involving probably a great deal of confusion. if statistical mechanics had only received consideration in connexion with the conduction of heat. In this case it is clear that the particular physical phenomena examined are of little theoretical interest compared to the principle by which they can be elucidated. The overwhelming importance of evolution to the biological sciences partly explains why the theory of Natural Selection should have been so fully identiﬁed with its role as an evolutionary agency. as to have suffered neglect as an independent principle worthy of scientiﬁc study. The other biological theories which have been put forward. either as auxiliaries. or as the sole means of organic evolution. are not quite in the same position. For advocates of Natural Selection have not failed to point out. what was evidently the chief attraction of the theory to Darwin and Wallace. that it proposes to give an account of the means of modiﬁcation in the organic world by reference only to ‘known’. or independently demonstrable. causes.

It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined. inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors. and. therefore. that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations σ1 and σ2. it is found that the distribution …,True,66ioxOQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,7986,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/earth-and-environmental-science-transactions-of-royal-society-of-edinburgh/article/xv-correlation-between-relatives-on-the-supposition-of-mendelian-inheritance/A60675052E0FB78C561F66C670BC75DE,9370923615547096977,/scholar?cites=9370923615547096977,,,0,0,0

Mathematical and Physical Sciences,1130,295-305,The Royal Society,Any topological framework requires the development of a theory of errors of characteristic and appropriate mathematical form. The paper develops a form of theory which appears to be appropriate to measurements of position on a sphere. The primary problems of estimation as applied to the true direction. and the precision of observations. are discussed in the subcases which arise. The simultaneous distribution of the amplitude and direction of the vector sum of a number of random unit vectors of given precision. is demonstrated. From this is derived the test of significance appropriate to a worker whose knowledge of precision lies entirely in the internal evidence of the sample. This is the analogue of ‘Student’s’ test in the Gaussian theory of errors.

Postmortem studies have shown high DA and HVA concentrations in various subcortical brain regions and greater than normal DA receptor densities in the brains of schizophrenic patients. Animal and human studies suggest that prefrontal DA neurons inhibit subcortical DA activity. The authors hypothesize that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormally low prefrontal DA activity leading to excessive DA activity in mesolimbic DA neurons. The implications of the possible co-occurrence of high and low DA activity in SZ are discussed.(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA. all rights reserved),True,gMhW8hoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2568,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-09301-001,5334431949009663677,/scholar?cites=5334431949009663677,,,0,0,0

The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication. followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications. giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25.498 genes encoding proteins from 11.000 families. similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans-the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families. indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes.

However. most monozygotic twin pairs are not identical; several types of phenotypic discordance may be observed. such as differences in susceptibilities to disease and a wide range of anthropomorphic features. There are several possible explanations for these observations. but one is the existence of epigenetic differences. To address this issue. we examined the global and locus-specific differences in DNA methylation and histone acetylation of a large cohort of monozygotic twins. We found that. although twins are epigenetically indistinguishable during the early years of life. older monozygous twins exhibited remarkable differences in their overall content and genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA and histone acetylation. affecting their gene-expression portrait.

Recent genome-wide scans have mapped a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome to chromosome 3q27. where the gene encoding adiponectin is located. Here we show that decreased expression of adiponectin correlates with insulin resistance in mouse models of altered insulin sensitivity. Adiponectin decreases insulin resistance by decreasing triglyceride content in muscle and liver in obese mice. This effect results from increased expression of molecules involved in both fatty-acid combustion and energy dissipation in muscle. Moreover. insulin resistance in lipoatrophic mice was completely reversed by the combination of physiological doses of adiponectin and leptin. but only partially by either adiponectin or leptin alone.

In this study we generated adiponectin-deficient mice to directly investigate whether adiponectin has a physiological protective role against diabetes and atherosclerosis in vivo. Heterozygous adiponectin-deficient (adipo +/−) mice showed mild insulin resistance. while homozygous adiponectin-deficient (adipo −/−) mice showed moderate insulin resistance with glucose intolerance despite body weight gain similar to that of wild-type mice. Moreover. adipo −/−mice showed 2-fold more neointimal formation in response to external vascular cuff injury than wild-type mice (p = 0.01).
