45092,AMP-activated protein kinase: ancient energy gauge provides clues to modern understanding of metabolism,2005,Barbara B Kahn and Thierry Alquier and David Carling and D Grahame Hardie,1.0,,1,15-25,Cell Press,The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved sensor of cellular energy status. and recent data demonstrate that it also plays a critical role in systemic energy balance. AMPK integrates nutritional and hormonal signals in peripheral tissues and the hypothalamus. It mediates effects of adipokines (leptin. adiponectin. and possibly resistin) in regulating food intake. body weight. and glucose and lipid homeostasis. AMPK is regulated by upstream kinases of which the tumor suppressor. LKB1. is the first to be identified. Complex signaling networks suggest that AMPK may prevent insulin resistance. in part by inhibiting pathways that antagonize insulin signaling. Through signaling. metabolic. and gene expression effects. AMPK enhances insulin sensitivity and fosters a metabolic milieu that may reduce the risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413104000099,10159073579623346271,/scholar?cites=10159073579623346271,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413104000099,0,0,0
45093,AMPK: a nutrient and energy sensor that maintains energy homeostasis,2012,D Grahame Hardie and Fiona A Ross and Simon A Hawley,13.0,Nature reviews Molecular cell biology,4,251-262,Nature Publishing Group,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a crucial cellular energy sensor. Once activated by falling energy status. it promotes ATP production by increasing the activity or expression of proteins involved in catabolism while conserving ATP by switching off biosynthetic pathways. AMPK also regulates metabolic energy balance at the whole-body level. For example. it mediates the effects of agents acting on the hypothalamus that promote feeding and entrains circadian rhythms of metabolism and feeding behaviour. Finally. recent studies reveal that AMPK conserves ATP levels through the regulation of processes other than metabolism. such as the cell cycle and neuronal membrane excitability.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC,2953,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm3311,6209461472747418723,/scholar?cites=6209461472747418723,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5726489/,0,0,0

The kinases are heterotrimers that comprise a catalytic subunit and regulatory subunits that sense cellular energy levels. When energy status is compromised. the system activates catabolic pathways and switches off protein. carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis. as well as cell growth and proliferation.

The AMP-activated protein kinase cascade acts as a metabolic sensor or “fuel gauge” that monitors cellular AMP and ATP levels because it is activated by increases in the AMP:ATP ratio. Once activated. the enzyme switches off ATP-consuming anabolic pathways and switches on ATP-producing catabolic pathways. such as fatty acid oxidation. The SNF1 complex in yeast is activated in response to the stress of glucose deprivation. In this case the intracellular signal or signals have not been identified; however. SNF1 activation is associated with depletion of ATP and elevation of AMP.

Two upstream kinases have been reported to activate AMPK in cell-free assays. i.e.. the tumor suppressor LKB1 and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase. However. evidence that this is physiologically relevant currently only exists for LKB1. We now report that there is a significant basal activity and phosphorylation of AMPK in LKB1-deficient cells that can be stimulated by Ca2+ ionophores. and studies using the CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 and isoform-specific siRNAs show that CaMKKβ is required for this effect. CaMKKβ also activates AMPK much more rapidly than CaMKKα in cell-free assays.

45098,The AMP‐activated protein kinase: Fuel gauge of the mammalian cell?,1997,D Grahame Hardie and David Carling,246.0,European journal of biochemistry,2,259-273,Blackwell Science Ltd,A single entity. the AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK). phosphorylates and regulates in vivo hydroxymethylglutraryl‐CoA reductase and acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (key regulatory enzymes of sterol synthesis and fatty acid synthesis. respectively). and probably many additional targets. The kinase is activated by high AMP and low ATP via a complex mechanism. which involves allosteric regulation. promotion of phosphorylation by an upstream protein kinase (AMPK kinase). and inhibition of dephosphorylation. This protein‐kinase cascade represents a sensitive system. which is activated by cellular stresses that deplete ATP. and thus acts like a cellular fuel gauge.

45101,5‐Aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleoside: a specific method for activating AMP‐activated protein kinase in intact cells?,1995,Julia M Corton and John G Gillespie and Simon A Hawley and D Grahame Hardie,229.0,European journal of biochemistry,2,558-565,Blackwell Science Ltd,The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) is believed to protect cells against environmental stress (e.g. heat shock) by switching off biosynthetic pathways. the key signal being elevation of AMP. Identification of novel targets for the kinase cascade would be facilitated by development of a specific agent for activating the kinase in intact cells. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with 5‐aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) results in accumulation of the monophosphorylated derivative (5‐aminoimidaz‐ole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleoside; ZMP) within the cell.

It is a potent tumour promoter that is not an activator of protein kinase C (ref. 3). but is a powerful inhibitor of protein phosphatases-1 and -2A (PP1 and PP2A) in vitro4.5. We report here that okadaic acid rapidly stimulates protein phosphorylation in intact cells. and behaves like a specific protein phosphatase inhibitor in a variety of metabolic processes. Our results indicate that PP1 and PP2A are the dominant protein phosphatases acting on a wide range of phosphoproteins in vivo.

The physiological roles of the SNF1 family are currently better defined in yeast and animals. so it is necessary to begin our review with a description of those systems. However. some of the higher-plant SnRKs appear to be highly conserved with their yeast and animal counterparts. and we suspect they will turn out to play very similar roles.

Once activated. it phosphorylates and inhibits key enzymes in energy-consuming biosynthetic pathways. thereby conserving cellular ATP. The creatine kinase–phosphocreatine system plays a key role in the control of ATP levels in tissues that have a high and rapidly fluctuating energy requirement. In this study. we provide direct evidence that these two energy-regulating systems are linked in skeletal muscle. We show that the AMPK inhibits creatine kinase by phosphorylation in vitro and in differentiated muscle cells.

Genetic studies in lower eukaryotes suggest that the ancestral role of AMPK was in response to starvation for a carbon source and that AMPK is involved in life-span extension in response to caloric restriction. In mammals. AMPK is activated by an increasing cellular AMP:ATP ratio (which signifies a decrease in energy) caused by metabolic stresses that interfere with ATP production (eg. hypoxia) or that accelerate ATP consumption (eg. muscle contraction). Because glucose deprivation can increase the AMP:ATP ratio. AMPK can also act as a glucose sensor. AMPK activation occurs by a dual mechanism that involves allosteric activation and phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Once activated.

This finding represented the first clear link between AMPK and cancer. Here we briefly discuss how this discovery came about. and describe some of the insights. especially into the role of AMPK in cancer. that have followed from it. In September 2003. our groups published a joint paper [1] in Journal of Biology (now BMC Biology) that identified the long-sought and elusive upstream kinase acting on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a complex containing LKB1. a known tumor suppressor. Similar findings were reported at about the same time by David Carling and Marian Carlson [2] and by Reuben Shaw and Lew Cantley [3]; at the time of writing these three papers have received between them a total of over 2.000 citations. These findings provided a direct link between a protein kinase. AMPK. which at the time was mainly associated with regulation of metabolism. and another protein kinase. LKB1. which was known from genetic studies to be a tumor suppressor. While the idea that cancer is in part a metabolic disorder (first suggested by Warburg in the 1920s [4]) is well recognized today [5]. this was not the case in 2003. and our paper perhaps contributed towards its renaissance.

The mechanism by which exercise stimulates glucose transport is not known. although it is distinct from the insulin-mediated pathway. Recently. it has been shown that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by exercise in skeletal muscle. whereas pharmacological activation of AMPK by 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR) leads to increased glucose transport. It has been postulated. therefore. that AMPK may be the link between exercise and glucose transport. To address this. we have examined the signaling pathway involved in the stimulation of glucose uptake after activation of AMPK. Here we show that activation of AMPK by AICAR in rat muscle and mouse H-2Kb muscle cells activates glucose transport approximately twofold.

DG AMP-Activated Protein Kinase: A Key System Mediating Metabolic Responses to Exercise. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc.. Vol. 36. No. 1. pp. 28–34. 2004. The finding that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated by exercise in skeletal muscle. reported by Winder and Hardie in 1996. provided the first hint that this signaling pathway might represent the elusive and long-sought system that was responsible for the metabolic changes associated with exercise. It triggered an increasing volume of research that has now largely vindicated this hypothesis although. in the usual manner of these things. it is not the whole story. As discussed in this article. it is becoming clear that the AMPK system is partly. but not entirely. responsible for the acute metabolic responses of muscle to acute exercise. It is particularly involved in the switch from the anaerobic metabolism of glycogen to oxidative metabolism of blood glucose and fatty acids. It also appears to be responsible for most. if not all. of the long-term metabolic adaptations to aerobic exercise (ie. to endurance training). particularly the up-regulation of mitochondrial content and oxidative metabolism. Interestingly. this role is a reflection of the evolutionary origins of the kinase. because the homolog of AMPK in a single-celled eukaryote. the brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. is also involved in the switch from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism.

AMPK is a heterotrimer comprising a catalytic z subunit with associated ſ and; subunits. these being homologous with the products of the SNF1. SIP1/SIP2/GAL83 and SNF4 genes in S. cerevisiae. The x subunit has at least two isoforms (x1 and x2). which differ in their AMP-dependence and subcellular localization. with 32 complexes being partly nuclear. AMPK is activated allosterically by 5'-AMP. which also promotes phosphorylation and activation by an upstream kinase. and inhibits dephosphorylation and inactivation. Elevation of AMP always accompanies depletion of ATP due to the action of adenylate kinase. Since high ATP antagonizes the activating effects of AMP. the system behaves like a cellular fuel gauge’. It is activated by various types of stress associated with ATP depletion. such as hypoxia. heat shock. metabolic poisoning and. in muscle. exercise. AMPK phosphorylates multiple targets which switch off anabolic pathways and switch on alternative catabolic pathways. The yeast SNF1 complex is switched on by glucose starvation. and its targets include transcription factors that repress transcription of genes required for catabolism of alter-native carbon sources.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,112,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=RmIABAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA13&dq=info:b57jMrOPvlQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=NjViMgMLGp&sig=LEzudJtk_HySz4CalO2CtmpcJkA,6106476144576667247,/scholar?cites=6106476144576667247,,,0,0,0

This system may therefore protect cells against environmental stress by switching off biosynthesis (i.e. growth) to conserve ATP. Recent biochemical and molecular genetic studies have shown that AMPK is closely related to the SNF1 gene product from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. and its homologues in higher plants.

45282,The regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis: simple procedure for the purification of acetyl CoA carboxylase from lactating rabbit mammary gland. and its phosphorylation by …,1978,D Grahame Hardie and Philip Cohen,91.0,FEBS letters,1,1-7,No longer published by Elsevier,A number of key regulatory enzymes in eukaryotic cells are now known to be controlled by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanisms. and there is increasing evidence that these interconversion reactions underlie the short term regulation of metabolism by external physiological stimuli (reviewed [I]).The rate at which cytoplasmic acetyl CoA is converted to long chain fatty acids is stimulated by insulin in fat cells [2] and inhibited by glucagon in hepatocytes [3]. Acetyl CoA carboxylase has been implicated as the enzyme at which these hormonal effects are exerted. but the mechanisms are not understood in molecular terms. Acetyl CoA carboxylase is completely dependent on the allosteric activator citrate for activity. and it is inhibited by very low concentrations of palmityl CoA [4]. There is also preliminary evidence which indicates that acetyl CoA carboxylase may be regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism. Relatively crude preparations from rat liver [S] or bovine mammary gland [6] undergo a time-dependent inactivation if they are incubated with magnesium ions and [Y-~~ P] ATP [7-91 and 32P-radioactivity is incorporated into a protein (s) which is precipitated by antiserum raised to a proteolytic fragment of rat liver acetyl CoA carboxylase [7-91.

Addition of glucose oxidase to cells generates H2O2 at a constant rate that is opposed by enzymic degradation. providing a good model for physiological oxidative stress. AMPK activation by glucose oxidase correlated with increases in cellular AMP:ATP and was greatly reduced in cells expressing an AMP-insensitive AMPK mutant. although a small degree of activation remained. The effects of increased AMP were partly due to inhibition of Thr172 dephosphorylation.

LKB1 contains a conserved serine residue near the C terminus (Ser-431 in mouse LKB1) that is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and p90-RSK. Although some studies suggest that LKB1 is constitutively active and is not rate-limiting for activation of AMPK. others have suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-431 is necessary to allow LKB1 to phosphorylate and activate AMPK and other downstream kinases. Prompted by our discovery of an LKB1 splice variant (LKB1S) that lacks Ser-431. we have reinvestigated this question.

There is a sequence in the first of these domains that is conserved in γ subunit homologues in all eukaryotes. and which resembles the sequence around sites phosphorylated on target proteins of AMPK. except that it has a non‐phosphorylatable residue in place of serine.

AMP-activated protein kinase is a heterotrimer of three different subunits. i.e. α. β. and γ. with α being the catalytic subunit and β and γ having regulatory roles. Although several studies have defined different domains in α and β involved in the interaction with the other subunits of the complex. little is known about the regions of the γ subunits involved in these interactions. To study this. we have made sequential deletions from the N termini of the γ subunit isoforms and studied the interactions with α and β subunits. both by two-hybrid analysis and by co-immunoprecipitation. Our results suggest that a conserved region of 20–25 amino acids in γ1. γ2. and γ3. immediately N-terminal to the Bateman domains. is required for the formation of a functional. active αβγ complex.

The number of protein phosphatase genes is currently smaller but may eventually rival that of the protein kinases. Why should such a large percentage of the genome be invested in encoding these enzymes? One can argue that this is because the protein phosphorylation cycles catalysed by protein kinases and phosphatases represent the most important and ubiquitous switching mechanism operating in the cell. Certainly the only other current challenger for this title would be the G protein cycles catalysed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins.

The greater extent of activation in extracts from 24 h-starved rats (200%) compared with fed controls (70%) implies that the decrease in acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in response to 24 h starvation may involve increased phosphorylation of the enzyme. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase was purified from the mammary glands of lactating rats in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors by avidin-Sepharose chromatography. Starvation of the rats for 24 h increased the concentration of citrate giving half-maximal activation by 75%. and decreased the Vmax. of the purified enzyme by 73%.

Phosphorylation of these substrates is stimulated 6‐fold and 40‐fold respectively by Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine.  3 The calmodulin‐dependent and phospholipid‐dependent protein kinases phosphorylate the same serine residue on ATP‐citrate lyase that is phosphorylated by cyclic‐AMP‐dependent protein kinase.

The conditions under which these different mechanisms operate. and their biological implications are unclear. Here. we show that. depending on the degree of elevation of cellular AMP. distinct compartmentalized pools of AMPK are activated. phosphorylating different sets of targets. Low glucose activates AMPK exclusively through the AMP-independent. AXIN-based pathway in lysosomes to phosphorylate targets such as ACC1 and SREBP1c. exerting early anti-anabolic and pro-catabolic roles.

Here. we report that CDK4 promotes anaerobic glycolysis and represses fatty acid oxidation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by targeting the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We also show that fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is specifically induced by AMPK complexes containing the α2 subunit. Moreover. we report that CDK4 represses FAO through direct phosphorylation and inhibition of AMPKα2. The expression of non-phosphorylatable AMPKα2 mutants. or the use of a CDK4 inhibitor. increased FAO rates in MEFs and myotubes. In addition. Cdk4−/− mice have increased oxidative metabolism and exercise capacity. Inhibition of CDK4 mimicked these alterations in normal mice. but not when skeletal muscle was AMPK deficient.

45378,Regulation of mammalian acetyl‐CoA carboxylase: Limited proteolysis mimics dephosphorylation,1981,Paul S Guy and D Grahame Hardie,132.0,FEBS letters,1,67-70,,Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyses the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. and in mammals both the amount of the enzyme and its catalytic activity is regulated [1]. Short-term regulation is achieved either by variation in the levels of allosteric effectors or by reversible phosphorylation [2]. The purified rat mammary enzyme is inactivated reversibly by phosphorylation with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase [3] and there is evidence for the existence of other. cyclic AMP-independent protein kinases which both phosphorylate and inactivate the rabbit mammary [3] and rat liver [4] enzymes. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase purified from rabbit mammary gland in the presence of sodium fluoride was obtained in a highly phosphorylated form of low specific activity [5]. The enzyme could be reactivated and dephosphorylated using a purified protein phosphatase [5]. We now report that the same effect is obtained by limited proteolysis. Our results suggest that acetyl-CoA carboxylase contains a domain or region near one end of the polypeptide chain. which is inhibitory when the enzyme is phosphorylated. and that other purified preparations of acetyl-CoA carboxylase described in the literature may already have lost this regulatory region due to limited proteolysis.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC,22,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82297535.pdf,1391419645132999067,/scholar?cites=1391419645132999067,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82297535.pdf,0,0,0

USA,There are several compelling reasons why one might wish to analyse and identify the exact site and surrounding sequence at which a particular protein is phosphorylated. either in vivo. in isolated or cultured cells. or in purified cell-free systems:(a) Identification of the protein kinase (s) responsible for phosphorylation in vivo or in intact cells. Most proteins are phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases. and one method to identify the physiologically relevant protein kinase is to compare the locations of the sites phosphorylated in intact cells with those phosphorylated by a purified protein kinase in a reconstituted cell-free system. If the sites do not match. this approach conclusively rules out the involvement of that protein kinase. while if they do match this gives strong. although not conclusive. support for the view that the protein kinase is phosphorylating the protein.(b) By comparing the sequences around several sites phosphorylated by the same protein kinase. one can gain clues as to the features which that protein kinase recognizes. These ideas can then be tested using synthetic peptides in which the sequence is varied (see Chapter 12). Unless one already has clues as to which variants to make from studies of natural phosphorylation sites. the number of variant peptides one would have to make would render the project impractical.(c) Phosphorylation sites are excellent candidates for site-directed mutagenesis. and this approach has been widely used.

The amino acid sequence around this site has been determined. Ca2'icalmodulin-dependent protein kinase 11 also phosphorylates hormone-sensitive lipase predominantly at this site. whilst cyclic-GMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates exclusively the regulatory site (site 1) which is also phosphorylated by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of site 2 has been found to inhibit subsequent phosphorylation and activation of hormone-sensitive lipase by the cyclic-AMP-dependent and cyclic-GMP-dependent protein kinases. indicating that site-2 phosphorylation may have an antilipolytic role in vivo.Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is the rate-limiting enzyme of adipose tissue lipolysis and its activity is under acute hormonal and neural control [l]. Lipolytic agents. such as noradrendline released from sympathetic nerve endings. adrenaline. corticotropin and glucagon. stimulate lipolysis by increasing the intracellular cyclic AMP concentration. resulting in activation of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase. This leads to phosphorylation of HSL which activates the enzyme and therefore stimulates lipolysis [2]. The major antilipolytic hormone is insulin which acts. at least in part. by reducing the intracellular cyclic AMP concentration [3].

New York. NY,The carotid bodies play a critical role in initiating compensatory ventilatory responses to hypoxia. However. the complete mechanism by which hypoxia excites the oxygen-sensing carotid body type 1 cells has not been fully defined. We have previously proposed that the enzyme adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK) may couple hypoxic inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to carotid body type I cell excitation (Evans. Mustard. Wyatt. Peers. Dipp. Kumar. Kinnear and Hardie 2005). Here we discuss evidence that AMPK is a key requirement for hypoxic chemotransduction by the carotid body.

This is usually achieved by modulation of the activity of pre-existing protein kinases (and/or protein phosphatases). rather than by changes in expression at the transcriptional or translational level: most protein kinases are in fact constitutively expressed. Assays of kinase expression levels (e.g.. by Western blotting) are therefore not sufficient. In some cases (e.g.. MAP kinases). activating phosphorylation events may produce a shift in mobility of the kinase on a Western blot which can be used as an index of activation.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) participates in the control of cellular and whole-body energy balance by its exquisite sensitivity to AMP. AMPK is thus able to sense and to react to an increasing AMP: ATP ratio within a complex upstream and downstream signaling network that responds to different energetic and metabolic stresses. The kinase forms heterotrimers with catalytic a-and regulatory ﬂ-. and y-subunits. which exist as different isoforms and splice variants. Global and local cellular ATP: ADP and phosphocreatinezcreatine ratios are controlled by the reactions of adenylate kinase and creatine kinase. respectively. which are the ﬁrst safeguards for keeping cellular ATP: ADP and ATP: AMP ratios high for as long as possible. However. AMPK operates under different metabolic conditions. with different modes of operation and in subsequent time frames. AMP is present at sub-micromolar concentrations in resting cells and increases strongly as a result of the adenylate kinase reaction when ATP is depleted. It is thus an ideal second messenger for reporting cellular energy status to the sensor AMPK. Full activation of AMPK is more complex. In addition to allosteric stimulation by micromo-lar AMP concentrations. it involves both covalent activation and inhibition via changes in phosphorylation of the Thr172 residue of the a-subunits by different upstream kinases and phosphatases.

45442,Hot stuff: thyroid hormones and AMPK,2010,D Grahame Hardie,20.0,Cell Research,12,1282-1284,Nature Publishing Group,Every high school biology student is taught that thyroid hormones increase the metabolic rate. This conclusion mainly arose from the effects of hyperthyroidism. the clinical condition characterized by excessive production of the hormones. Symptoms include weight loss despite increased appetite. tremors. cardiac palpitations. irritability. intolerance to heat and increased perspiration. Although understanding of how thyroid hormones increase metabolic rate at the molecular level has been elusive. a recent paper by Antonio Vidal-Puig and colleagues in Nature Medicine [1] provides important new insights. The thyroid gland produces mainly thyroxine (T4). but other tissues deiodinate this to the more potent hormone. tri-iodothyronine (T3). T3 binds to thyroid receptors (TRα.

Findings that AMPK acts downstream of the tumor suppressor LKB1 have suggested that AMPK might also suppress tumorigenesis. In mouse models of B and T cell lymphoma in which genetic loss of AMPK occurred before tumor initiation. tumorigenesis was accelerated. confirming that AMPK has tumor-suppressor functions. However. when loss of AMPK in a T cell lymphoma model occurred after tumor initiation. or simultaneously with tumor initiation in a lung cancer model. the disease was ameliorated.

It has been proposed to have many beneficial metabolic effects by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). but the mechanism of activation remained uncertain. We report that cordycepin enters cells via adenosine transporters and is converted by cellular metabolism into mono-. di-. and triphosphates. which at high cordycepin concentrations can almost replace cellular adenine nucleotides. AMPK activation by cordycepin in intact cells correlates with the content of cordycepin monophosphate and not other cordycepin or adenine nucleotides.

Here. we will consider this question. and the role in this respect of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Emerging evidence suggests that AMPK facilitates central and peripheral reflexes that coordinate breathing and oxygen supply. and contributes to the central regulation of feeding and food choice. We propose. therefore. that oxygen supply to the body is aligned with not only the quantity we eat. but also nutrient-based diet selection. and that the cell-specific expression pattern of AMPK subunit isoforms is critical to appropriate system alignment in this respect. Currently available information on how oxygen supply may be aligned with feeding and food choice. or vice versa. through our motivation to breathe and select particular nutrients is sparse. fragmented and lacks any integrated understanding. By addressing this. we aim to provide the foundations for a clinical perspective that reveals untapped potential. by highlighting how aberrant cell-specific changes in the expression of AMPK subunit isoforms could give rise. in part. to known associations between metabolic disease. such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. sleep-disordered breathing. pulmonary hypertension and acute respiratory distress syndrome.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:ifIdVpG6JtcC,3,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/10/3518,12345136974873855252,/scholar?cites=12345136974873855252,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/10/3518/pdf,0,0,0

NY,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor that is activated by increases in the cellular AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios by three mechanisms: (1) allosteric activation. (2) promotion of phosphorylation at Thr172 on the α subunit by upstream kinases. and (3) inhibition of dephosphorylation of Thr172 by protein phosphatases. All of these effects are triggered by the binding of AMP or ADP at one or more of three sites on the γ subunit. where they displace ATP. AMPK is also activated by ligands that bind in the ADaM site. which is located between the α and β subunits.

Dordrecht,Intercellular communication via gap junctions. or by the still hypothetical mechanism of anchored cell surface messengers (Chapter 1). is obviously limited to cells which are in contact with each other. The other major mechanism by which cells communicate. which forms the subject of the remainder of this book. is by secreted signal molecules or first messengers. This method has the advantage that communication can occur over a great range of distances (from tens of nanometres in the case of a neurotransmitter. to tens of metres in the case of a hormone acting in a blue whale!). Cells in higher animals signal to each other by probably hundreds of different first messengers. with the list of those that have been identified increasing year by year.

In the present study. feeding rats a palatable diet of standard laboratory chow (BP Nutrition) and cheese crackers (McVities ‘Cheddars’) increased the proportion of fat consumed from 2% to 20% of the total weight of food eaten. and resulted in a 50% inhibition of mammary gland lipogenesis. in confirmation of previous observations (Pullinger et al.. 1983). The effect persisted through the isolation of mammary acini and the rate of fatty acid synthesis in acini from high-fat-fed rats was 40% lower than that from chow-fed controls (Table 1).

However. the organization of the proteins involved in its catalysis varies greatly between different species (Table I).

They receive. through receptor and sensor proteins. input information about the internal and external cellular environment. as well as signals from other cells.

45481,AMP-Activated Protein Kinase: Do We Need Activators or Inhibitors to Treat or Prevent Cancer?,2021,Fiona M Russell and David Grahame Hardie,22.0,,1,186,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of cellular energy balance. In response to metabolic stress. it acts to redress energy imbalance through promotion of ATP-generating catabolic processes and inhibition of ATP-consuming processes. including cell growth and proliferation. While findings that AMPK was a downstream effector of the tumour suppressor LKB1 indicated that it might act to repress tumourigenesis. more recent evidence suggests that AMPK can either suppress or promote cancer. depending on the context. Prior to tumourigenesis AMPK may indeed restrain aberrant growth. but once a cancer has arisen. AMPK may instead support survival of the cancer cells by adjusting their rate of growth to match their energy supply. as well as promoting genome stability. The two isoforms of the AMPK catalytic subunit may have distinct functions in human cancers. with the AMPK-α1 gene often being amplified. while the AMPK-α2 gene is more often mutated. The prevalence of metabolic disorders. such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes. has led to the development of a wide range of AMPK-activating drugs. While these might be useful as preventative therapeutics in individuals predisposed to cancer. it seems more likely that AMPK inhibitors. whose development has lagged behind that of activators. would be efficacious for the treatment of pre-existing cancers.

45489,AMP-activated protein kinase gamma-2 (AMPK-g2) subunit modulates AMPK activities to ensure ovarian cancer progression,2016,DW Chan and MH Yung and DG Hardie and HYS Ngan,,"International Symposium on AMP-activated Protein Kinase, AMPK 2016",,,,Targeting cancer cell metabolism with chemotherapeutics is a new promising strategy to improve cancer treatment. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric Ser/Thr kinase complex that consists of a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits (β. γ). and acts as an energy-sensor to govern cancer cell metabolism. How of their expressions codifying of AMPK activity and cancer cell metabolism in tumor progression remain unclear. Our previous study reported that AMPK subunits are diversely expressed during ovarian cancer progression while their impact on ovarian cancer oncogenesis during tumor progression is obscure. Here. we show that the AMPK-γ2 subunit (γ2) is frequently upregulated and is inversely correlated with AMPK activity in advanced ovarian cancer. Overexpression of γ2 enables to suppress AMPK/mTOR signaling. promotes oncogenic capacities in ovarian cancer cells. and attenuates AICAR-induced cell growth retardation (AICAR is the common pharmacologic AMPK activator). Mechanistic studies revealed that AMPK-α1/2. -β1 and -γ1 subunits are predominantly forming AMPK trimeric complexes. while a substantial proportion of γ2 acts as a free form and enables to compete with the AMPK complex for AMP/ZMP binding that in turns. suppresses AMPK activation. Clinico-pathological analysis demonstrated that the overexpressed AMPK-γ2 was inversely correlated with lower AMPK activity in advanced and high-graded ovarian cancers. suggesting the expression status of AMPK-γ2 is clinically relevance. Taken together. these findings suggest γ2 prefers to exist as a fine turner to modulate AMPK activities …,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:ouq6-fJ2VSQC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3023011200717316136&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
45490,Oxidative stress activates AMPK in cultured cells primarily,2014,F Romana Auciello and Fiona A Ross and Naoko Ikematsu and D Grahame Hardie,,,,,,28 AMPK is known to be activated by oxidative stress. Addition of glucose oxidase to cells generates 29 H2O2 at a constant rate that is opposed by enzymic degradation. providing a good model for physi-30 ological oxidative stress. AMPK activation by glucose oxidase correlated with increases in cellular 31 AMP: ATP and was greatly reduced in cells expressing an AMP-insensitive AMPK mutant. although 32 a small degree of activation remained. The effects of increased AMP were partly due to inhibition 33 of Thr172 dephosphorylation. These results suggest that changes in adenine nucleotides. rather than 34 direct oxidative modification. are the major drivers of AMPK activation during oxidative stress. 35© 2014 Published by Elsevier BV on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:3GgZsIzdB2YC,0,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1201642.pdf,,,,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1201642.pdf,0,0,0
45491,AMPK–roles in nutrient sensing and in cancer,2014,D Grahame Hardie,2.0,Cancer & Metabolism,1,1-1,BioMed Central,The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central sensor of cellular energy status. The kinase is activated by increases in cellular AMP by three mechanisms:(i) allosteric activation;(ii) promotion of Thr172 phosphorylation by the upstream kinase LKB1;(iii) inhibition of Thr172 dephosphorylation. Of these. only the third is mimicked by ADP. but all three are antagonized by ATP. thus allowing the system to act as a sensor of cellular energy. Genes encoding the three subunits of AMPK are found in essentially all eukaryotes. and in unicellular eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae the kinase has a role in sensing and responding to glucose starvation. This cellautonomous role has been preserved in multicellular eukaryotes. but the system has also adapted to respond to hormones involved in regulating whole body energy balance. such as ghrelin. leptin and adiponectin.

Mutations in PRKAG2 have been implicated in some previous cases of HCM. PRKAG2 encodes the γ2 isoform of AMPK. a heterotrimeric enzyme with major roles in regulation of energy metabolism in response to cellular stress. We have identified a K475E mutation which results in a neonatal HCM phenotype. We have demonstrated that overexpressing the K475E mutant in HEK‐293 cells leads to 1) a markedly increase in the basal phosphorylation of T172 and associated kinase activity; 2) a reduction in the sensitivity to AMP in allosteric activation. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in downstream signaling pathways induced by the mutation.Methods: Primary dermal fibroblast cultures of control and a patient with the K475E mutation were maintained under standard cell culture condition.

An obvious way to do this would be to have systems that monitor the levels of ATP and ADP. although because of the adenylate kinase reaction (2ADP↔ ATP+ AMP). AMP is actually a more sensitive indicator of energy stress than ADP. Following the discoveries that glycogen phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase were regulated by AMP and ATP. Daniel Atkinson proposed that all enzymes at branch points between biosynthesis and degradation would be regulated by adenine nucleotides. This turned out to be correct. but what Atkinson did not anticipate was that sensing of nucleotides would. in most cases. be performed not by the metabolic enzymes themselves. but by a signalling protein. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase). AMPK occurs in essentially all eukaryotes and consists of heterotrimeric complexes comprising catalytic α subunits and regulatory β and γ subunits. of which the latter carries the nucleotide-binding sites.

45500,The Laforin–Malin Complex. Involved in Lafora Disease. Promotes the Incorporation of K63-linked Ubiquitin Chains into AMP-activated Protein Kinase β Subunits,2010,Daniel Moreno Andrés and Mhairi Towler and D Grahame Hardie and Erwin Knecht and Pascual Sanz,,,,,American Society for Cell Biology,Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by defects in the function of at least two proteins: laforin. a dual-specificity protein phosphatase. and malin. an E3-ubiquitin ligase. In this study. we report that a functional laforin–malin complex promotes the ubiquitination of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a sensor of cellular energy status. This reaction occurs when any of the three AMPK subunits (α. β. and γ) are expressed individually in the cell. and it also occurs on AMPKβ when it is part of a heterotrimeric complex. We also report that the laforin–malin complex promotes the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains. which are not involved in proteasome degradation. On the contrary. this modification increases the steady-state levels of at least AMPKβ subunit. possibly because it leads to the accumulation of this protein into inclusion bodies. These results suggest that the modification introduced by the laforin–malin complex could affect the subcellular distribution of AMPKβ subunits.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:xvKSgulxyWUC,0,https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/30631,,,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/30631/1/Mol%20Biol%20Cell%20021-02578%202010.pdf,0,0,0

The sequence around Thr-172 is highly conserved between the two catalytic subunit isoforms of AMPK and the twelve AMPK-related kinases. and LKB1 has been shown to act upstream of all of them. We now report that none of the AMPK-related kinases tested could be phosphorylated or activated in intact cells or cell-free assays by CaMKKβ. although we did observe a slow phosphorylation and activation of BRSK1 by CaMKKα. Despite recent reports. we could not find any evidence that the α and/or β subunits of AMPK formed a stable complex with CaMKKβ.

After 8 wk dietary treatment. mice receiving a high-fat diet exhibited an increase in the amount of adipose tissue. accompanied by a surge in plasma leptin concentration (from 5.4–16.0 ng/ml). This was associated with: 1) an induction of uncoupling protein-2 (120%). 2) an increase in the phosphorylated form of AMP-activated protein kinase (120%). and 3) a reduction in lactate concentration and lactate dehydrogenase activity in myocardial tissue (40%). Because DIO induces leptin resistance. we analyzed leptin receptor functionality by measuring phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in response to acute leptin (1 mg/kg). We observed that leptin receptor signaling remained unaltered within the heart but was fully impaired within the hypothalamus. Taken together. these data show that during DIO development. there is a metabolic shift in the heart aimed at increasing fatty acid oxidation to the detriment of carbohydrates. This effect seems to be leptin-dependent. suggesting that the increased adiposity observed during the onset of obesity might contribute to impairing ectopic lipidic deposition in the heart.(Endocrinology 148: 924–931. 2007)OVERNUTRITION CAUSES ADIPOCYTES to store the surplus fuel in the form of triglycerides (TGs) for retrieval during periods of caloric need.

AMPK is activated whenever a metabolic stress causes a decrease in the cellular ATP:ADP ratio: because of the adenylate kinase reaction. this is always accompanied by a much larger increase in the AMP:ATP ratio. Binding of AMP to the gamma subunit of AMPK causes two effects that are antagonized by ATP: (i) it inhibits dephosphorylation of Thr-172. causing a sensitive switch to the active. phosphorylated form; (ii) it allosterically activates the phosphorylated kinase. The major upstream kinase in most cells is the tumor suppressor LKB1. Since AMPK can cause an arrest of cell growth …,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:jL-93Qbq4QoC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9843016476733952220&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

45513,Associated and correlated quantum fluid dynamics in laser-induced ionization of helium,2007,Vikas,107.0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY,3,647-656,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,The present work addresses the relevance of a quantum fluid perspective for a many-electron system in explaining the photoionization of the helium atom interacting with an intense laser field. A nonperturbative approach. based on the (total)-electron density description within the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) formalism. is employed to study the exchange and correlation effects allied to the photoionization process. A distinctive behavior of the photoionization process. revealing a clear transition from the low-intensity multiphoton to the high-intensity tunneling regime. is vindicated within a single optical cycle of the laser field. In the low-intensity multiphoton regime. recollisions are observed to be more prominent. whereas in the high-intensity tunneling regime. the strong field ionization is found to be more pronounced besides the recollisions.

We have further explored the effect of these drugs on cellular AMP:ATP ratio. the activation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Na+ transport across H441 cells via the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC. The cellular AMP:ATP ratio was increased 3 fold compared to control after treatment with phenformin (5mM) but did not change with AICAR (2mM). Both drugs induced a ~2.0 fold increase in AMPK activity from 0.03±0.002 to 0.05±0.008 and 0.04±0.004 to 0.07±0.005 nmols/min/mg respectively.

As a major port for Atlantic convoys during the war. it had received much attention from the bombers. and my early memories are of the empty gaps between houses where the bombs had landed–my grandparents’ house had been one of them. My grandfather. Thomas Hardie. was the son of a Scottish farmer. who had moved to England in 1906 and set up a tailoring business that my father took over. I suspect that he would have preferred to have been a teacher or an academic. but funds did not stretch to sending him to university. My father subscribed to the National Geographic magazine. which had glossy pictures of wild-life and exotic places. as well as articles about science and exploration. As a young child I enjoyed looking at the pictures. and I credit this with arousing my interest in science. as well as a continuing fascination with exploration and the …,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC,0,https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15216540701556873,,,,https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15216540701556873,0,0,0

However. the mechanism by which this process is coupled to discrete. cell-specific Ca” signalling mechanisms remains elusive. We considered the possibility that hypoxia may increase the cellular ATP/AMP ratio. increase the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and thereby evoke Ca"" signals in Ox-sensing cells. Co-immunoprecipitation identified ol B2/1 as the primary AMPK isozyme in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle. whilst the tissue-specific distribution of AMPK activities and their activation by hypoxia suggested that the AMPK-01 catalytic subunit isoform is key to the regulation of O2-sensing cells. Strikingly. 3D reconstruction of immunofluorescence images showed AMPK-01 to be located throughout the cytoplasm of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and. by contrast. targeted to the plasma membrane in carotid body glomus cells. Consistent with these observations Ca"" imaging. tension recording and electrophysiology demonstrated that AMPK. like hypoxia. activates each cell type via discrete Ca"" signalling mechanisms: cyclic ADP-ribose-dependent Ca"" mobi-lization from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and voltage-gated Caº influx into carotid body glomus cells. Thus. metabolic-sensing by AMPK underpins the cell-specific response of O2-sensing cells to hypoxia.",True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:blZQ8lPX3m0C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14375004304048489980&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

45525,AMPK: A Key Sensor of Fuel and Energy Status in Skeletal,2005,D Grahame Hardie and Kei Sakamoto,,,,,,Downloaded from sues (23). Perfusion of rat hindlimb muscle with AICAR caused AMPK activation. and. as expected. this correlated with inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. decreased malonyl-CoA. and increased fatty acid oxidation (79)(FIGURE 1). In the same study. glucose uptake was also measured and found to increase (79). an effect that was subsequently shown to be due to increased transport across the plasma membrane (47) and to involve translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (72). These results demonstrated that activation of AMPK in muscle was sufficient for increased glucose uptake. but not that it was necessary for the increased glucose uptake observed during contraction. Before discussing the recent evidence that strongly supports that idea. we need to introduce the AMPK system itself in more detail.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17868020647940116225&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
