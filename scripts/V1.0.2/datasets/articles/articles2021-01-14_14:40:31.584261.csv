45092,AMP-activated protein kinase: ancient energy gauge provides clues to modern understanding of metabolism,2005,Barbara B Kahn and Thierry Alquier and David Carling and D Grahame Hardie,1,,1,15-25,Cell Press,The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved sensor of cellular energy status. and recent data demonstrate that it also plays a critical role in systemic energy balance. AMPK integrates nutritional and hormonal signals in peripheral tissues and the hypothalamus. It mediates effects of adipokines (leptin. adiponectin. and possibly resistin) in regulating food intake. body weight. and glucose and lipid homeostasis. AMPK is regulated by upstream kinases of which the tumor suppressor. LKB1. is the first to be identified. Complex signaling networks suggest that AMPK may prevent insulin resistance. in part by inhibiting pathways that antagonize insulin signaling. Through signaling. metabolic. and gene expression effects. AMPK enhances insulin sensitivity and fosters a metabolic milieu that may reduce the risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2989,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413104000099,10159073579623346271,/scholar?cites=10159073579623346271,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413104000099,0
45093,AMPK: a nutrient and energy sensor that maintains energy homeostasis,2012,D Grahame Hardie and Fiona A Ross and Simon A Hawley,13,Nature reviews Molecular cell biology,4,251-262,Nature Publishing Group,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a crucial cellular energy sensor. Once activated by falling energy status. it promotes ATP production by increasing the activity or expression of proteins involved in catabolism while conserving ATP by switching off biosynthetic pathways. AMPK also regulates metabolic energy balance at the whole-body level. For example. it mediates the effects of agents acting on the hypothalamus that promote feeding and entrains circadian rhythms of metabolism and feeding behaviour. Finally. recent studies reveal that AMPK conserves ATP levels through the regulation of processes other than metabolism. such as the cell cycle and neuronal membrane excitability.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC,2953,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm3311,6209461472747418723,/scholar?cites=6209461472747418723,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5726489/,0

The kinases are heterotrimers that comprise a catalytic subunit and regulatory subunits that sense cellular energy levels. When energy status is compromised. the system activates catabolic pathways and switches off protein. carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis. as well as cell growth and proliferation.

The AMP-activated protein kinase cascade acts as a metabolic sensor or “fuel gauge” that monitors cellular AMP and ATP levels because it is activated by increases in the AMP:ATP ratio. Once activated. the enzyme switches off ATP-consuming anabolic pathways and switches on ATP-producing catabolic pathways. such as fatty acid oxidation. The SNF1 complex in yeast is activated in response to the stress of glucose deprivation. In this case the intracellular signal or signals have not been identified; however. SNF1 activation is associated with depletion of ATP and elevation of AMP.

Two upstream kinases have been reported to activate AMPK in cell-free assays. i.e.. the tumor suppressor LKB1 and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase. However. evidence that this is physiologically relevant currently only exists for LKB1. We now report that there is a significant basal activity and phosphorylation of AMPK in LKB1-deficient cells that can be stimulated by Ca2+ ionophores. and studies using the CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 and isoform-specific siRNAs show that CaMKKβ is required for this effect. CaMKKβ also activates AMPK much more rapidly than CaMKKα in cell-free assays.

The kinase is activated by high AMP and low ATP via a complex mechanism. which involves allosteric regulation. promotion of phosphorylation by an upstream protein kinase (AMPK kinase). and inhibition of dephosphorylation. This protein‐kinase cascade represents a sensitive system. which is activated by cellular stresses that deplete ATP. and thus acts like a cellular fuel gauge.

45101,5‐Aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleoside: a specific method for activating AMP‐activated protein kinase in intact cells?,1995,Julia M Corton and John G Gillespie and Simon A Hawley and D Grahame Hardie,229,European journal of biochemistry,2,558-565,Blackwell Science Ltd,The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) is believed to protect cells against environmental stress (e.g. heat shock) by switching off biosynthetic pathways. the key signal being elevation of AMP. Identification of novel targets for the kinase cascade would be facilitated by development of a specific agent for activating the kinase in intact cells. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with 5‐aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) results in accumulation of the monophosphorylated derivative (5‐aminoimidaz‐ole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleoside; ZMP) within the cell. ZMP mimics both activating effects of AMP on AMPK. i.e. direct allosteric activation and promotion of phosphorylation by AMPK kinase.

It is a potent tumour promoter that is not an activator of protein kinase C (ref. 3). but is a powerful inhibitor of protein phosphatases-1 and -2A (PP1 and PP2A) in vitro4.5. We report here that okadaic acid rapidly stimulates protein phosphorylation in intact cells. and behaves like a specific protein phosphatase inhibitor in a variety of metabolic processes. Our results indicate that PP1 and PP2A are the dominant protein phosphatases acting on a wide range of phosphoproteins in vivo.

Members of the family have been discovered and rediscovered several times in recent years by different biochemical assays and/or genetic screens. and only when DNA and amino acid sequences became available was it realised that all of the different functions described were due to the members of the same protein kinase family.

Genetic studies in lower eukaryotes suggest that the ancestral role of AMPK was in response to starvation for a carbon source and that AMPK is involved in life-span extension in response to caloric restriction. In mammals. AMPK is activated by an increasing cellular AMP:ATP ratio (which signifies a decrease in energy) caused by metabolic stresses that interfere with ATP production (eg. hypoxia) or that accelerate ATP consumption (eg. muscle contraction). Because glucose deprivation can increase the AMP:ATP ratio. AMPK can also act as a glucose sensor.

45174,LKB1 and AMPK and the cancer-metabolism link-ten years after,2013,D Grahame Hardie and Dario R Alessi,11,,1,1-11,BioMed Central,The identification of a complex containing the tumor suppressor LKB1 as the critical upstream kinase required for the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by metabolic stress was reported in an article in Journal of Biology in 2003. This finding represented the first clear link between AMPK and cancer. Here we briefly discuss how this discovery came about. and describe some of the insights. especially into the role of AMPK in cancer. that have followed from it. In September 2003. our groups published a joint paper [1] in Journal of Biology (now BMC Biology) that identified the long-sought and elusive upstream kinase acting on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a complex containing LKB1. a known tumor suppressor. Similar findings were reported at about the same time by David Carling and Marian Carlson [2] and by Reuben Shaw and Lew Cantley [3]; at the time of writing these three papers have received between them a total of over 2.000 citations. These findings provided a direct link between a protein kinase. AMPK. which at the time was mainly associated with regulation of metabolism. and another protein kinase. LKB1. which was known from genetic studies to be a tumor suppressor. While the idea that cancer is in part a metabolic disorder (first suggested by Warburg in the 1920s [4]) is well recognized today [5]. this was not the case in 2003. and our paper perhaps contributed towards its renaissance.

Recently. it has been shown that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by exercise in skeletal muscle. whereas pharmacological activation of AMPK by 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR) leads to increased glucose transport. It has been postulated. therefore. that AMPK may be the link between exercise and glucose transport. To address this. we have examined the signaling pathway involved in the stimulation of glucose uptake after activation of AMPK. Here we show that activation of AMPK by AICAR in rat muscle and mouse H-2Kb muscle cells activates glucose transport approximately twofold.

45189,AMP‐activated protein kinase: a key regulator of energy balance with many roles in human disease,2014,D Grahame Hardie,276,Journal of internal medicine,6,543-559,,The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellular energy status that regulates cellular and whole‐body energy balance. A recently reported crystal structure has illuminated the complex regulatory mechanisms by which AMP and ADP cause activation of AMPK. involving phosphorylation by the upstream kinase LKB1. Once activated by falling cellular energy status. AMPK activates catabolic pathways that generate ATP whilst inhibiting anabolic pathways and other cellular processes that consume ATP. A role of AMPK is implicated in many human diseases. Mutations in the γ2 subunit cause heart disease due to excessive glycogen storage in cardiac myocytes. leading to ventricular pre‐excitation.

DG AMP-Activated Protein Kinase: A Key System Mediating Metabolic Responses to Exercise. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc.. Vol. 36. No. 1. pp. 28–34. 2004. The finding that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated by exercise in skeletal muscle. reported by Winder and Hardie in 1996. provided the first hint that this signaling pathway might represent the elusive and long-sought system that was responsible for the metabolic changes associated with exercise. It triggered an increasing volume of research that has now largely vindicated this hypothesis although. in the usual manner of these things. it is not the whole story. As discussed in this article. it is becoming clear that the AMPK system is partly. but not entirely. responsible for the acute metabolic responses of muscle to acute exercise. It is particularly involved in the switch from the anaerobic metabolism of glycogen to oxidative metabolism of blood glucose and fatty acids. It also appears to be responsible for most. if not all. of the long-term metabolic adaptations to aerobic exercise (ie. to endurance training). particularly the up-regulation of mitochondrial content and oxidative metabolism. Interestingly. this role is a reflection of the evolutionary origins of the kinase. because the homolog of AMPK in a single-celled eukaryote. the brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. is also involved in the switch from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism.

45227,Energy sensing by the AMP-activated protein kinase and its effects on muscle metabolism,2011,D Grahame Hardie,70,Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,1,92-99,Cambridge University Press,The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellular energy status. and a regulator of energy balance at both the cellular and whole body levels. Although ubiquitously expressed. its function is best understood in skeletal muscle. AMPK contains sites that reversibly bind AMP or ATP. with an increase in cellular AMP:ATP ratio (signalling a fall in cellular energy status) switching on the kinase. In muscle. AMPK activation is therefore triggered by sustained contraction. and appears to be particularly important in the metabolic changes that occur in the transition from resistance to endurance exercise. Once activated. AMPK switches on catabolic processes that generate ATP. while switching off energy-requiring processes not essential in the short term. Thus. it acutely activates glucose uptake (by promoting translocation of the transporter GLUT4 to the membrane) and fatty acid oxidation. while switching off …,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC,139,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/energy-sensing-by-the-ampactivated-protein-kinase-and-its-effects-on-muscle-metabolism/FF76F9136C65292FFB9C9DF4B61D6B30,3943389939145293889,/scholar?cites=3943389939145293889,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/FF76F9136C65292FFB9C9DF4B61D6B30/S0029665110003915a.pdf/energy_sensing_by_the_ampactivated_protein_kinase_and_its_effects_on_muscle_metabolism.pdf,0

45248,protein kinase family in the response to cellular stress,2014,D Grahame Hardie,64,Cellular Responses to Stress,,13-27,Princeton University Press,The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in mammals. and its homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. are activated by cellular stresses associated with ATP depletion. AMPK is a heterotrimer comprising a catalytic z subunit with associated ſ and; subunits. these being homologous with the products of the SNF1. SIP1/SIP2/GAL83 and SNF4 genes in S. cerevisiae. The x subunit has at least two isoforms (x1 and x2). which differ in their AMP-dependence and subcellular localization. with 32 complexes being partly nuclear. AMPK is activated allosterically by 5'-AMP. which also promotes phosphorylation and activation by an upstream kinase. and inhibits dephosphorylation and inactivation. Elevation of AMP always accompanies depletion of ATP due to the action of adenylate kinase. Since high ATP antagonizes the activating effects of AMP. the system behaves like a cellular fuel gauge’. It is activated by various types of stress associated with ATP depletion. such as hypoxia. heat shock. metabolic poisoning and. in muscle. exercise. AMPK phosphorylates multiple targets which switch off anabolic pathways and switch on alternative catabolic pathways. The yeast SNF1 complex is switched on by glucose starvation. and its targets include transcription factors that repress transcription of genes required for catabolism of alter-native carbon sources.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,112,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=RmIABAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA13&dq=info:b57jMrOPvlQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=NjViMgMLGp&sig=LEzudJtk_HySz4CalO2CtmpcJkA,6106476144576667247,/scholar?cites=6106476144576667247,,,0

Over the last 2 decades. it has become apparent that AMPK regulates several other cellular functions and has specific roles in cardiovascular tissues. acting to regulate cardiac metabolism and contractile function. as well as promoting anticontractile. anti-inflammatory. and antiatherogenic actions in blood vessels.

While it appears to have evolved in single-celled eukaryotes to regulate energy balance in a cell-autonomous manner. during the evolution of multicellular animals its role has become adapted so that it also regulates energy balance at the whole body level. by responding to hormones that act primarily on the hypothalamus. AMPK monitors energy balance at the cellular level by sensing the ratios of AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP. and recent structural analyses of the AMPK heterotrimer that have provided insight into the complex mechanisms for these effects will be discussed.

BRSK2. or cell cycle arrest,2009,Sarah Fogarty and D Grahame Hardie,284,Journal of Biological Chemistry,1,77-84,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,The tumor suppressor protein kinase LKB1 exerts its effects by phosphorylating and activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and members of the AMPK-related kinase family. such as the brain-specific kinases BRSK1/BRSK2 (SAD-B/SAD-A). LKB1 contains a conserved serine residue near the C terminus (Ser-431 in mouse LKB1) that is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and p90-RSK. Although some studies suggest that LKB1 is constitutively active and is not rate-limiting for activation of AMPK. others have suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-431 is necessary to allow LKB1 to phosphorylate and activate AMPK and other downstream kinases. Prompted by our discovery of an LKB1 splice variant (LKB1S) that lacks Ser-431. we have reinvestigated this question. In HeLa cells (which lack endogenous LKB1). co-expression with STRADα and MO25α of wild type LKB1. the S431A or …,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC,73,https://www.jbc.org/content/284/1/77.short,7741060089417145686,/scholar?cites=7741060089417145686,,https://www.jbc.org/content/284/1/77.full.pdf,0

Ltd,The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) system monitors cellular energy status by sensing AMP and ATP. and is a key regulator of energy balance at the cellular and whole‐body levels. AMPK exists as heterotrimeric αβγ complexes. and the γ subunits contain two tandem domains that bind the regulatory nucleotides. There is a sequence in the first of these domains that is conserved in γ subunit homologues in all eukaryotes. and which resembles the sequence around sites phosphorylated on target proteins of AMPK. except that it has a non‐phosphorylatable residue in place of serine. We propose that in the absence of AMP this pseudosubstrate sequence binds to the active site groove on the α subunit. preventing phosphorylation by the upstream kinase. LKB1. and access to downstream targets. Binding of AMP causes a conformational change that prevents this interaction and relieves the inhibition.

Na+ entry at the luminal membrane is predominantly via the amiloride‐sensitive Na+ channel (ENaC) down its electrochemical gradient. This gradient is generated and maintained by basolateral Na+ extrusion via Na+.K+‐ATPase an energy‐dependent process. Several kinases and factors that activate them are known to regulate these processes; however. the role of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the lung is unknown. AMPK is an ultra‐sensitive cellular energy sensor that monitors energy consumption and down‐regulates ATP‐consuming processes when activated.

It is well accepted that the rate-limiting enzymes in glycogenesis and glycogenolysis are glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GPh). respectively. Both enzymes are regulated by reversible phosphorylation and by allosteric effectors. However. evidence in the literature indicates that changes in muscle GS and GPh intracellular distribution may constitute a new regulatory mechanism of glycogen metabolism. Already in the 1960s. it was proposed that glycogen was present in dynamic cellular organelles that were termed glycosomas but no such cellular entities have ever been demonstrated.

AMP-activated protein kinase is a heterotrimer of three different subunits. i.e. α. β. and γ. with α being the catalytic subunit and β and γ having regulatory roles. Although several studies have defined different domains in α and β involved in the interaction with the other subunits of the complex. little is known about the regions of the γ subunits involved in these interactions. To study this. we have made sequential deletions from the N termini of the γ subunit isoforms and studied the interactions with α and β subunits. both by two-hybrid analysis and by co-immunoprecipitation. Our results suggest that a conserved region of 20–25 amino acids in γ1. γ2. and γ3. immediately N-terminal to the Bateman domains. is required for the formation of a functional. active αβγ complex.

The number of protein phosphatase genes is currently smaller but may eventually rival that of the protein kinases. Why should such a large percentage of the genome be invested in encoding these enzymes? One can argue that this is because the protein phosphorylation cycles catalysed by protein kinases and phosphatases represent the most important and ubiquitous switching mechanism operating in the cell. Certainly the only other current challenger for this title would be the G protein cycles catalysed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins.

Fyn. However. we report that AMPK activation by SU6656 is independent of Src kinases or tyrosine phosphorylation of LKB1 or AMPK and is not due to decreased cellular energy status or binding at the ADaM site on AMPK. SU6656 is a potent AMPK inhibitor. yet binding at the catalytic site paradoxically promotes phosphorylation of Thr172 by LKB1. This would enhance phosphorylation of downstream targets provided the lifetime of Thr172 phosphorylation was sufficient to allow dissociation of the inhibitor and subsequent catalysis prior to its dephosphorylation.

Protein kinases can be classified by various biochemical criteria. such as by their substrate specificity or their regulatory properties.

Short-term regulation is achieved either by variation in the levels of allosteric effectors or by reversible phosphorylation [2]. The purified rat mammary enzyme is inactivated reversibly by phosphorylation with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase [3] and there is evidence for the existence of other. cyclic AMP-independent protein kinases which both phosphorylate and inactivate the rabbit mammary [3] and rat liver [4] enzymes. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase purified from rabbit mammary gland in the presence of sodium fluoride was obtained in a highly phosphorylated form of low specific activity [5]. The enzyme could be reactivated and dephosphorylated using a purified protein phosphatase [5]. We now report that the same effect is obtained by limited proteolysis.

Accumulation of cholesterol and its intermediates. such as oxysterols. lead to activation of the nuclear receptors LXRs (liver X receptors).

As detailed below. we have been able to reproduce observations of time‐dependent changes in the activity of acyl‐CoA: cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) in rat liver microsomes. that were suggested to represent evidence of a role for reversible phosphorylation in the regulation of cholesterol ester formation.2. ACAT in washed rat liver microsomes was inactivated in a time‐dependent manner in the presence of Mg2+. However. this effect of Mg2+ appears to be caused by aggregation of microsomal vesicles rather than dephosphorylation. since it could be abolished by rehomogenization. and was mimicked by Ca2+. another agent which causes aggregation.

USA,There are several compelling reasons why one might wish to analyse and identify the exact site and surrounding sequence at which a particular protein is phosphorylated. either in vivo. in isolated or cultured cells. or in purified cell-free systems:(a) Identification of the protein kinase (s) responsible for phosphorylation in vivo or in intact cells. Most proteins are phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases. and one method to identify the physiologically relevant protein kinase is to compare the locations of the sites phosphorylated in intact cells with those phosphorylated by a purified protein kinase in a reconstituted cell-free system. If the sites do not match. this approach conclusively rules out the involvement of that protein kinase. while if they do match this gives strong. although not conclusive. support for the view that the protein kinase is phosphorylating the protein.(b) By comparing the sequences around several sites phosphorylated by the same protein kinase. one can gain clues as to the features which that protein kinase recognizes. These ideas can then be tested using synthetic peptides in which the sequence is varied (see Chapter 12). Unless one already has clues as to which variants to make from studies of natural phosphorylation sites. the number of variant peptides one would have to make would render the project impractical.(c) Phosphorylation sites are excellent candidates for site-directed mutagenesis. and this approach has been widely used. However. identifying phosphorylation sites from a DNA sequence and'consensus' sequences alone is a risky and unreliable business. and it is clearly preferable to identify the site (s) chemically …,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC,10,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15568654579005305520&hl=en&oi=scholarr,15568654579005305520,/scholar?cites=15568654579005305520,,,0

The rate of fatty acid synthesis de novo in these tissues must be regulated according to the nutritional and physiological status of the animal. Such short-term regulation is primarily achieved through the action of hormones. Acetyl-CoA carboxyulase is a prime target for such hormonal regulation as it catalyses the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA to fatty acid. While acetyl-CoA carboxylase can be regulated allosterically by citrate (activator) and fatty acyl-CoA (inhibitor). it is becoming clear that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. leading to inactivation and activation respectively. play a major part in the hormonal regulation of this enzyme activity.

Biochem,,249-254,,Hormone-sensitive lipase is phosphorylated at a single site (site 2) in vitro by the AMP-activated protein kinase. without any direct effect on the activity of the enzyme. The amino acid sequence around this site has been determined. Ca2'icalmodulin-dependent protein kinase 11 also phosphorylates hormone-sensitive lipase predominantly at this site. whilst cyclic-GMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates exclusively the regulatory site (site 1) which is also phosphorylated by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of site 2 has been found to inhibit subsequent phosphorylation and activation of hormone-sensitive lipase by the cyclic-AMP-dependent and cyclic-GMP-dependent protein kinases. indicating that site-2 phosphorylation may have an antilipolytic role in vivo.Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is the rate-limiting enzyme of adipose tissue lipolysis and its activity is under acute hormonal and neural control [l]. Lipolytic agents. such as noradrendline released from sympathetic nerve endings. adrenaline. corticotropin and glucagon. stimulate lipolysis by increasing the intracellular cyclic AMP concentration. resulting in activation of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase. This leads to phosphorylation of HSL which activates the enzyme and therefore stimulates lipolysis [2]. The major antilipolytic hormone is insulin which acts. at least in part. by reducing the intracellular cyclic AMP concentration [3]. HSL is phosphorylated at a single site by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro [4. 5].

Using the criterion of analytical isoelectric focusing. the 32P-peptides obtained by this method were found to be similar. although not identical. to peptides obtained by a more conventional digestion of trichloroacetic acid precipitates. Digestion on Western blots is more straightforward than electrophoretic elution of individual gel slices. gives better recoveries than direct digestion of gel slices. and is particularly suitable for peptide mapping of small peptides which bind to nitrocellulose but would diffuse out of polyacrylamide gels during the commonly used fixing and staining procedures.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC,8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003269786905713,4750603582284863727,/scholar?cites=4750603582284863727,,,0

45426,Peptide assay of protein kinases and use of variant peptides to determine recognition motifs,2000,D Grahame Hardie,,,,191-201,Humana Press,It is now clear that the major mechanism by which cellular function is switched from one state to another in eukaryotic cells. including the response to cellular stress (1). is via changes in phosphorylation of key proteins. This is usually achieved by modulation of the activity of pre-existing protein kinases (and/or protein phosphatases). rather than by changes in expression at the transcriptional or translational level: most protein kinases are in fact constitutively expressed. Assays of kinase expression levels (e.g.. by Western blotting) are therefore not sufficient. In some cases (e.g.. MAP kinases). activating phosphorylation events may produce a shift in mobility of the kinase on a Western blot which can be used as an index of activation. However. since nonactivating phosphorylation events can also produce mobility shifts. this method can be unreliable and there remains a requirement to develop direct assays of …,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C,7,https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1385/1-59259-054-3:191,8410819779895502384,/scholar?cites=8410819779895502384,,,0

A recent study shows that small-molecule activators of two pathways thought to transduce these effects can enhance the effects of training. or even substitute for it.Skeletal muscle is a highly adaptable tissue that responds to repeated exercise by altering its contractile properties and its metabolism. For example. endurance training results in an increased capacity to generate energy (in the form of ATP) from aerobic pathways.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) participates in the control of cellular and whole-body energy balance by its exquisite sensitivity to AMP. AMPK is thus able to sense and to react to an increasing AMP: ATP ratio within a complex upstream and downstream signaling network that responds to different energetic and metabolic stresses. The kinase forms heterotrimers with catalytic a-and regulatory ﬂ-. and y-subunits. which exist as different isoforms and splice variants. Global and local cellular ATP: ADP and phosphocreatinezcreatine ratios are controlled by the reactions of adenylate kinase and creatine kinase. respectively. which are the ﬁrst safeguards for keeping cellular ATP: ADP and ATP: AMP ratios high for as long as possible. However. AMPK operates under different metabolic conditions. with different modes of operation and in subsequent time frames. AMP is present at sub-micromolar concentrations in resting cells and increases strongly as a result of the adenylate kinase reaction when ATP is depleted. It is thus an ideal second messenger for reporting cellular energy status to the sensor AMPK. Full activation of AMPK is more complex. In addition to allosteric stimulation by micromo-lar AMP concentrations. it involves both covalent activation and inhibition via changes in phosphorylation of the Thr172 residue of the a-subunits by different upstream kinases and phosphatases. Such activation depends on different kinds of energy stress as well as on hormones and other signals. including …,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C,5,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FN0l9u0txj8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA303&dq=info:xHQ0uFnBFKcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=3DBnVPMHu4&sig=yYl92azKTlr4wSxUbZ7PIx-usk4,12039460294954874052,/scholar?cites=12039460294954874052,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Theo_Wallimann/publication/229872938_Signaling_by_AMP-activated_Protein_Kinase/links/59de445faca27247d7942c54/Signaling-by-AMP-activated-Protein-Kinase.pdf,0

Findings that AMPK acts downstream of the tumor suppressor LKB1 have suggested that AMPK might also suppress tumorigenesis. In mouse models of B and T cell lymphoma in which genetic loss of AMPK occurred before tumor initiation. tumorigenesis was accelerated. confirming that AMPK has tumor-suppressor functions. However. when loss of AMPK in a T cell lymphoma model occurred after tumor initiation. or simultaneously with tumor initiation in a lung cancer model. the disease was ameliorated. Thus. once tumorigenesis has occurred. AMPK switches from tumor suppression to tumor promotion.

It has been proposed to have many beneficial metabolic effects by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). but the mechanism of activation remained uncertain. We report that cordycepin enters cells via adenosine transporters and is converted by cellular metabolism into mono-. di-. and triphosphates. which at high cordycepin concentrations can almost replace cellular adenine nucleotides. AMPK activation by cordycepin in intact cells correlates with the content of cordycepin monophosphate and not other cordycepin or adenine nucleotides. Genetic knockout of AMPK sensitizes cells to the cytotoxic effects of cordycepin. In cell-free assays. cordycepin monophosphate mimics all three effects of AMP on AMPK. while activation in cells is blocked by a γ-subunit mutation that …,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:PDAgwb0ELvkC,3,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451945620300040,9021850203327079463,/scholar?cites=9021850203327079463,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451945620300040,0

45451,AMPK and the Need to Breathe and Feed: What’s the Matter with Oxygen?,2020,A Mark Evans and D Grahame Hardie,21,,10,3518,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,We live and to do so we must breathe and eat. so are we a combination of what we eat and breathe? Here. we will consider this question. and the role in this respect of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Emerging evidence suggests that AMPK facilitates central and peripheral reflexes that coordinate breathing and oxygen supply. and contributes to the central regulation of feeding and food choice. We propose. therefore. that oxygen supply to the body is aligned with not only the quantity we eat. but also nutrient-based diet selection. and that the cell-specific expression pattern of AMPK subunit isoforms is critical to appropriate system alignment in this respect. Currently available information on how oxygen supply may be aligned with feeding and food choice. or vice versa. through our motivation to breathe and select particular nutrients is sparse. fragmented and lacks any integrated understanding. By addressing this. we aim to provide the foundations for a clinical perspective that reveals untapped potential. by highlighting how aberrant cell-specific changes in the expression of AMPK subunit isoforms could give rise. in part. to known associations between metabolic disease. such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. sleep-disordered breathing. pulmonary hypertension and acute respiratory distress syndrome.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:ifIdVpG6JtcC,3,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/10/3518,12345136974873855252,/scholar?cites=12345136974873855252,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/10/3518/pdf,0

NY,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor that is activated by increases in the cellular AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios by three mechanisms: (1) allosteric activation. (2) promotion of phosphorylation at Thr172 on the α subunit by upstream kinases. and (3) inhibition of dephosphorylation of Thr172 by protein phosphatases. All of these effects are triggered by the binding of AMP or ADP at one or more of three sites on the γ subunit. where they displace ATP. AMPK is also activated by ligands that bind in the ADaM site. which is located between the α and β subunits.

In the same review. Hunter drew a perceptive analogy between protein kinase–phosphatase cycles and the transistors in an electronic device. Like transistors. kinase–phosphatase cycles can act either as amplifiers or as digital switches. This analogy can be extended further: one way of thinking about living cells is to consider them as informationprocessing devices. They receive. through receptor and sensor proteins. input information about the internal and external cellular environment. as well as signals from other cells. This information is then integrated and processed into output–that is. changes in the activity and expression of cellular proteins.

It is therefore not surprising that the first messengers should have evolved by simple modifications of common metabolites such as amino acids. fatty acids and cholesterol. This chapter will discuss how the structures of the first messengers are related to those common metabolites. and the metabolic pathways which interconvert them.

45481,AMP-Activated Protein Kinase: Do We Need Activators or Inhibitors to Treat or Prevent Cancer?,2021,Fiona M Russell and David Grahame Hardie,22,,1,186,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of cellular energy balance. In response to metabolic stress. it acts to redress energy imbalance through promotion of ATP-generating catabolic processes and inhibition of ATP-consuming processes. including cell growth and proliferation. While findings that AMPK was a downstream effector of the tumour suppressor LKB1 indicated that it might act to repress tumourigenesis. more recent evidence suggests that AMPK can either suppress or promote cancer. depending on the context. Prior to tumourigenesis AMPK may indeed restrain aberrant growth. but once a cancer has arisen. AMPK may instead support survival of the cancer cells by adjusting their rate of growth to match their energy supply. as well as promoting genome stability. The two isoforms of the AMPK catalytic subunit may have distinct functions in human cancers. with the AMPK-α1 gene often being amplified. while the AMPK-α2 gene is more often mutated. The prevalence of metabolic disorders. such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes. has led to the development of a wide range of AMPK-activating drugs. While these might be useful as preventative therapeutics in individuals predisposed to cancer. it seems more likely that AMPK inhibitors. whose development has lagged behind that of activators. would be efficacious for the treatment of pre-existing cancers.

45489,AMP-activated protein kinase gamma-2 (AMPK-g2) subunit modulates AMPK activities to ensure ovarian cancer progression,2016,DW Chan and MH Yung and DG Hardie and HYS Ngan,,"International Symposium on AMP-activated Protein Kinase, AMPK 2016",,,,Targeting cancer cell metabolism with chemotherapeutics is a new promising strategy to improve cancer treatment. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric Ser/Thr kinase complex that consists of a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits (β. γ). and acts as an energy-sensor to govern cancer cell metabolism. How of their expressions codifying of AMPK activity and cancer cell metabolism in tumor progression remain unclear. Our previous study reported that AMPK subunits are diversely expressed during ovarian cancer progression while their impact on ovarian cancer oncogenesis during tumor progression is obscure. Here. we show that the AMPK-γ2 subunit (γ2) is frequently upregulated and is inversely correlated with AMPK activity in advanced ovarian cancer. Overexpression of γ2 enables to suppress AMPK/mTOR signaling. promotes oncogenic capacities in ovarian cancer cells. and attenuates AICAR-induced cell growth retardation (AICAR is the common pharmacologic AMPK activator). Mechanistic studies revealed that AMPK-α1/2. -β1 and -γ1 subunits are predominantly forming AMPK trimeric complexes. while a substantial proportion of γ2 acts as a free form and enables to compete with the AMPK complex for AMP/ZMP binding that in turns. suppresses AMPK activation. Clinico-pathological analysis demonstrated that the overexpressed AMPK-γ2 was inversely correlated with lower AMPK activity in advanced and high-graded ovarian cancers. suggesting the expression status of AMPK-γ2 is clinically relevance. Taken together. these findings suggest γ2 prefers to exist as a fine turner to modulate AMPK activities …,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:ouq6-fJ2VSQC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3023011200717316136&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

Addition of glucose oxidase to cells generates 29 H2O2 at a constant rate that is opposed by enzymic degradation. providing a good model for physi-30 ological oxidative stress. AMPK activation by glucose oxidase correlated with increases in cellular 31 AMP: ATP and was greatly reduced in cells expressing an AMP-insensitive AMPK mutant. although 32 a small degree of activation remained.

The kinase is activated by increases in cellular AMP by three mechanisms:(i) allosteric activation;(ii) promotion of Thr172 phosphorylation by the upstream kinase LKB1;(iii) inhibition of Thr172 dephosphorylation. Of these. only the third is mimicked by ADP. but all three are antagonized by ATP. thus allowing the system to act as a sensor of cellular energy.

Here we show that exposure of L6 myotubes to palmitate. a saturated fatty acid. induces activation of the NFkB pathway (based on increased IKK phosphorylation. IkBa loss and elevated IL-6 mRNA expression) and that this was associated with enhanced phosphorylation/activation of p38 MAPK. JNK and ERK as well as impaired insulin-dependent activation of PKB/Akt and glucose transport. NFkB activation by palmitate was unaffected by pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or JNK. but was suppressed significantly by inhibition of MEK/ERK signalling.

An obvious way to do this would be to have systems that monitor the levels of ATP and ADP. although because of the adenylate kinase reaction (2ADP↔ ATP+ AMP). AMP is actually a more sensitive indicator of energy stress than ADP. Following the discoveries that glycogen phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase were regulated by AMP and ATP. Daniel Atkinson proposed that all enzymes at branch points between biosynthesis and degradation would be regulated by adenine nucleotides. This turned out to be correct. but what Atkinson did not anticipate was that sensing of nucleotides would. in most cases. be performed not by the metabolic enzymes themselves. but by a signalling protein. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase). AMPK occurs in essentially all eukaryotes and consists of heterotrimeric complexes comprising catalytic α subunits and regulatory β and γ subunits. of which the latter carries the nucleotide-binding sites.

Promotes the Incorporation of K63-linked Ubiquitin Chains into AMP-activated Protein Kinase β Subunits,2010,Daniel Moreno Andrés and Mhairi Towler and D Grahame Hardie and Erwin Knecht and Pascual Sanz,,,,,American Society for Cell Biology,Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by defects in the function of at least two proteins: laforin. a dual-specificity protein phosphatase. and malin. an E3-ubiquitin ligase. In this study. we report that a functional laforin–malin complex promotes the ubiquitination of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a sensor of cellular energy status. This reaction occurs when any of the three AMPK subunits (α. β. and γ) are expressed individually in the cell. and it also occurs on AMPKβ when it is part of a heterotrimeric complex. We also report that the laforin–malin complex promotes the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains. which are not involved in proteasome degradation. On the contrary. this modification increases the steady-state levels of at least AMPKβ subunit. possibly because it leads to the accumulation of this protein into inclusion bodies. These results suggest that the modification introduced by the laforin–malin complex could affect the subcellular distribution of AMPKβ subunits.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:xvKSgulxyWUC,0,https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/30631,,,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/30631/1/Mol%20Biol%20Cell%20021-02578%202010.pdf,0

AMPK monitors the AMP:ATP ratio as an index of metabolic stress and. when activated. adjusts cell metabolism to maintain ATP supply. Previously we have proposed that AMPK may also underpin hypoxia-response coupling in the carotid bodies. which mediate the entire ventilatory response of the body to acute hypoxia. We therefore sought to determine whether or not AMPK was sufficient and necessary for this process by global knockout of the catalytic alpha subunits in mice.AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 knockout mice (European Mutant Mouse Archive) were bred onto a C57BL/6: 129/X1 background to obtain knockout (−/−) animals.

The sequence around Thr-172 is highly conserved between the two catalytic subunit isoforms of AMPK and the twelve AMPK-related kinases. and LKB1 has been shown to act upstream of all of them. We now report that none of the AMPK-related kinases tested could be phosphorylated or activated in intact cells or cell-free assays by CaMKKβ. although we did observe a slow phosphorylation and activation of BRSK1 by CaMKKα. Despite recent reports. we could not find any evidence that the α and/or β subunits of AMPK formed a stable complex with CaMKKβ.

After 8 wk dietary treatment. mice receiving a high-fat diet exhibited an increase in the amount of adipose tissue. accompanied by a surge in plasma leptin concentration (from 5.4–16.0 ng/ml). This was associated with: 1) an induction of uncoupling protein-2 (120%). 2) an increase in the phosphorylated form of AMP-activated protein kinase (120%). and 3) a reduction in lactate concentration and lactate dehydrogenase activity in myocardial tissue (40%). Because DIO induces leptin resistance. we analyzed leptin receptor functionality by measuring phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in response to acute leptin (1 mg/kg). We observed that leptin receptor signaling remained unaltered within the heart but was fully impaired within the hypothalamus. Taken together. these data show that during DIO development. there is a metabolic shift in the heart aimed at increasing fatty acid oxidation to the detriment of carbohydrates. This effect seems to be leptin-dependent. suggesting that the increased adiposity observed during the onset of obesity might contribute to impairing ectopic lipidic deposition in the heart.(Endocrinology 148: 924–931. 2007)OVERNUTRITION CAUSES ADIPOCYTES to store the surplus fuel in the form of triglycerides (TGs) for retrieval during periods of caloric need.

45511,AMPK-the fuel gauge of the eukaryotic cell,2008,David Grahame Hardie,22,,1_supplement,114.1-114.1,Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is expressed in essentially all eukaryotic cells and acts as a sensor of cellular energy status. It is a heterotrimer comprised of catalytic alpha subunits and regulatory beta and gamma subunits. and is only active after phosphorylation at Thr-172 within the kinase domain by upstream kinases. AMPK is activated whenever a metabolic stress causes a decrease in the cellular ATP:ADP ratio: because of the adenylate kinase reaction. this is always accompanied by a much larger increase in the AMP:ATP ratio. Binding of AMP to the gamma subunit of AMPK causes two effects that are antagonized by ATP: (i) it inhibits dephosphorylation of Thr-172. causing a sensitive switch to the active. phosphorylated form; (ii) it allosterically activates the phosphorylated kinase.

A nonperturbative approach. based on the (total)-electron density description within the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) formalism. is employed to study the exchange and correlation effects allied to the photoionization process. A distinctive behavior of the photoionization process. revealing a clear transition from the low-intensity multiphoton to the high-intensity tunneling regime. is vindicated within a single optical cycle of the laser field. In the low-intensity multiphoton regime. recollisions are observed to be more prominent. whereas in the high-intensity tunneling regime. the strong field ionization is found to be more pronounced besides the recollisions.

However. the mechanism by which this process is coupled to discrete. cell-specific Ca” signalling mechanisms remains elusive. We considered the possibility that hypoxia may increase the cellular ATP/AMP ratio. increase the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and thereby evoke Ca"" signals in Ox-sensing cells. Co-immunoprecipitation identified ol B2/1 as the primary AMPK isozyme in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle. whilst the tissue-specific distribution of AMPK activities and their activation by hypoxia suggested that the AMPK-01 catalytic subunit isoform is key to the regulation of O2-sensing cells. Strikingly. 3D reconstruction of immunofluorescence images showed AMPK-01 to be located throughout the cytoplasm of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and. by contrast. targeted to the plasma membrane in carotid body glomus cells. Consistent with these observations Ca"" imaging. tension recording and electrophysiology demonstrated that AMPK. like hypoxia. activates each cell type via discrete Ca"" signalling mechanisms: cyclic ADP-ribose-dependent Ca"" mobi-lization from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and voltage-gated Caº influx into carotid body glomus cells. Thus. metabolic-sensing by AMPK underpins the cell-specific response of O2-sensing cells to hypoxia.",True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:blZQ8lPX3m0C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14375004304048489980&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

45525,AMPK: A Key Sensor of Fuel and Energy Status in Skeletal,2005,D Grahame Hardie and Kei Sakamoto,,,,,,Downloaded from sues (23). Perfusion of rat hindlimb muscle with AICAR caused AMPK activation. and. as expected. this correlated with inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. decreased malonyl-CoA. and increased fatty acid oxidation (79)(FIGURE 1). In the same study. glucose uptake was also measured and found to increase (79). an effect that was subsequently shown to be due to increased transport across the plasma membrane (47) and to involve translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (72). These results demonstrated that activation of AMPK in muscle was sufficient for increased glucose uptake. but not that it was necessary for the increased glucose uptake observed during contraction. Before discussing the recent evidence that strongly supports that idea. we need to introduce the AMPK system itself in more detail.,True,ra3rdoUAAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17868020647940116225&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0
