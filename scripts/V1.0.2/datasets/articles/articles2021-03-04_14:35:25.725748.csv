Both groups have apparently had long associations of coevolution. host switching and adaptation with fishes and have become highly successful in their respective habitats. Current estimates of species richness for the two groups suggest that they may be remarkably similar. Here we consider the nature of the diversity of the Monogenea and Digenea of fishes in terms of richness of species and higher taxa to determine what processes may be responsible for observed differences. The Monogenea includes at least two super-genera (Dactylogyrus and Gyrodactylus) each of which has hundreds of species; no comparable genera are found in the Digenea.

Akademie ved Ceské republiky,Dendromonocotyle species (Monogenea: Monocotylidae) are the only monocotylids to parasitize the skin of chondrichthyan hosts. Currently 11 species are recorded from the skin of ray species in the Dasyatidae. Myliobatidae and Urolophidae. There have been increasing reports of Dendromonocotyle outbreaks on rays kept in public aquaria. This paper provides a broad review of Dendromonocotyle that should assist taxonomists and aquarists with species identification and help decisions on potential control methods for Dendromonocotyle infections. The taxonomy and host-specificity of Dendromonocotyle are discussed and a key to current species is provided. We summarise what little is known about the biology of Dendromonocotyle including egg embryonation and hatching. feeding. camouflage and reproduction. The efficacy of freshwater baths. chemical treatments and biological control measures such as the use of cleaner fish for Dendromonocotyle is also discussed. We demonstrate that effective control of Dendromonocotyle on captive rays is hampered by the lack of basic biological data on the life cycle of the parasites. A case history is provided outlining the success of a public aquarium (Underwater World. Mooloolaba. Queensland. Australia) in managing D. pipinna infections on captive Taeniura meyeni without chemical intervention simply by taking measures to reduce host stress.Most Monogenea are recorded from the skin. fins and gills of teleost fish and only about 200 valid monogenean species in seven families (Acanthocotylidae.

Ancylostoma caninum. undergo arrested development preceding transmission to a host. Many of the mRNAs up-regulated at this stage are likely to encode proteins that facilitate the transition from a free-living to a parasitic larva. The initial phase of mammalian host invasion by A. caninum L3 (herein termed “activation”) can be mimicked in vitro by culturing L3 in serum-containing medium.Methodology/Principal FindingsThe mRNAs differentially transcribed between activated and non-activated L3 were identified by suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH). The analysis of these mRNAs on a custom oligonucleotide microarray printed with the SSH expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and publicly available A. caninum ESTs (non-subtracted) yielded 602 differentially expressed mRNAs. of which the most highly represented sequences encoded members of the pathogenesis-related protein (PRP) superfamily and proteases. Comparison of these A. caninum mRNAs with those of Caenorhabditis elegans larvae exiting from developmental (dauer) arrest demonstrated unexpectedly large differences in gene ontology profiles. C. elegans dauer exiting L3 up-regulated expression of mostly intracellular molecules involved in growth and development. Such mRNAs are virtually absent from activated hookworm larvae. and instead are over-represented by mRNAs encoding extracellular proteins with putative roles in host-parasite interactions.Conclusions/SignificanceAlthough this should not invalidate C. elegans dauer exit as a model for hookworm activation. it highlights the limitations of this free …,True,zRcIKcwAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,79,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000130,1187494254003872156,/scholar?cites=1187494254003872156,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000130,0,0,0

S. ersei n. sp. is described from a limnodriloidine oligochaete. Doliodrilus diverticulatus Erséus. 1985. from Moreton Bay. Queensland. Australia. Development is asynchronous. there being all stages from two‐celled pansporoblasts through to mature spores present simultaneously within a host. Spores develop in groups of eight within pansporoblasts in the coelom and when mature are located also in the intestinal lumen. The primordial spore envelope and sporoplasm develop separately in the pansporoblast until the polar filament is formed within the polar capsule and the capsulogenic cell cytoplasm has begun to degrade. The sporoplasm then enters the spore through a separated valve junction.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that clinical metronidazole resistance in T. vaginalis does not occur via the same mechanism as laboratory‐induced metronidazole resistance—that is. via hydrogenosome down sizing. Ultrathin sections of this parasite were examined using transmission electron microscopy and the size and area of the cell and hydrogenosomes were compared between drug‐resistant laboratory lines and clinically resistant isolates. Clinical metronidazole‐resistant T. vaginalis had similar‐sized hydrogenosomes as a metronidazole‐sensitive isolate. Inducing metronidazole resistance in both of these isolates caused down sizing of hydrogenosomes.

Previous phylogenies of the group have exclusively considered members of one family. the Ophryoscolecidae. which are symbiotic within ruminants. We sought to improve understanding of evolution within the entodiniomorphs by expanding the range of ciliates examined to include the Cycloposthiidae and Macropodiniidae (symbionts of equids and macropodids respectively). The entire SSU-rRNA gene was sequenced for 3 species. Cycloposthium edentatum. Macropodinium ennuensis and M. yalanbense. and aligned against 14 litostome species and 2 postciliodesmatophoran outgroup species. Cycloposthium was consistently grouped as the sister-taxon to the Ophryoscolecidae although support for this relationship was low. This suggests that there is more evolutionary distance between the Cycloposthiidae and Ophryoscolecidae than previously inferred from studies of gross morphology. cell ontogeny or ultrastructure. In contrast. Macropodinium did not group with any of the entodiniomorphs. instead forming the sister group to the entire Trichostomatia (Entodiniomorphida+ Vestibuliferida). This early diverging position for the macropodiniids is concordant with their morphology and ontogeny which failed to group the family with any of the entodiniomorph suborders.

Deaths of juvenile oysters have been associated with the presence of a herpes virus (OsHV-1 µvar) and bacterial populations of the genus Vibrio. Although the pathogenicity of OsHV-1 µvar. as well as several strains of Vibrio has been demonstrated by experimental infections. our understanding of the complexity of infections occurring in the natural environment remains limited. In the present study. we use specific-pathogen-free (SPF) oysters infected in an estuarine environment to study the diversity and dynamics of cultured microbial populations during disease expression. We observe that rapid Vibrio colonization followed by viral replication precedes oyster death. No correlation was found between the vibrio concentration and viral load in co-infected animals. We show that the quantity of viral DNA is a predictor of mortality. however. in the absence of bacteria. a high load of herpes virus is not sufficient to induce the full expression of the disease. In addition. we demonstrate that juvenile mortalities can occur in the absence of herpes virus. indicating that the herpes virus appears neither essential nor sufficient to cause juvenile deaths; whereas bacteria are necessary for the disease.

Ostrea edulis Linnaeus. Since its description. the lifecycle of this protozoan parasite has eluded discovery. Attempts to infect oysters experimentally have been unsuccessful and led to the hypothesis of a complex life-cycle involving several hosts. Knowledge of this life-cycle is of central importance in order to manage oyster disease. However. the exploration of M. refringens life-cycle has been previously limited by the detection tools available and the tremendous number of species to be screened in enzootic areas. In this study. these two restrictions were circumvented by the use of both molecular detection tools and a mesocosm with low biodiversity. Screening of the entire fauna of the pond for AT. refringens DNA was systematically undertaken using PCR. Here. we show that the copepod Paracartia (Acartia) grani is a host of M. refringens. Not only was DNA of M. refringens consistently detectcd in P. grani but also the presence of the parasite in the ovarian tissues was demonstrated using in situ hybridization. Finally. successful experimental transmissions provided evidence that P. grani can be infected from infected flat oysters.,True,5shVTjwAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,92,https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00000/2778/,8374421212011693046,/scholar?cites=8374421212011693046,,https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/2002/publication-2778.pdf,0,0,0

Previous sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of M. refringens isolates derived from the infected mussels (Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovinciallis) and the oyster (Ostrea edulis) in Europe did not reveal genetic polymorphisms despite indications from epizootiological data that distinct types may exist. We investigated the existence of polymorphisms in the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA genes. The sequences of this region proved to be clearly dimorphic among Marteilia from five sampling sites. The distribution of the two genetic types. named “O” and “M”. appeared to be linked to the host species. oysters and mussels. respectively.

1140327,How to sequence and annotate insect mitochondrial genomes for systematic and comparative genomics research,2014,Stephen Cameron,39,Systematic Entomology,3,400-411,Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd.,Over the past decade the mitochondrial (mt) genome has become the most widely used genomic resource available for systematic entomology. While the availability of other types of ‘–omics’ data – in particular transcriptomes – is increasing rapidly. mt genomes are still vastly cheaper to sequence and are far less demanding of high quality templates. Furthermore. almost all other ‘–omics’ approaches also sequence the mt genome. and so it can form a bridge between legacy and contemporary datasets. Mitochondrial genomes have now been sequenced for all insect orders. and in many instances representatives of each major lineage within orders (suborders. series or superfamilies depending on the group). They have also been applied to systematic questions at all taxonomic scales from resolving interordinal relationships (e.g. Cameron et al.. 2009; Wan et al.. 2012; Wang et al.. 2012). through many intraordinal (e.g. Dowton et al.. 2009; Timmermans et al.. 2010; Zhao et al. 2013a) and family-level studies (e.g. Nelson et al.. 2012; Zhao et al.. 2013b) to population/biogeographic studies (e.g. Ma et al.. 2012). Methodological issues around the use of mt genomes in insect phylogenetic analyses and the empirical results found to date have recently been reviewed by Cameron (2014). yet the technical aspects of sequencing and annotating mt genomes were not covered.

Studies have shown. however. that this assumption is often not accurate. particularly in divergent lineages. Nonstationary sequence evolution. when taxa in different lineages evolve in different ways. can lead to unequal nucleotide composition.

Current DNA barcoding in animals involves the use of the 5' half of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene (CO1) to diagnose and delimit species. However. there is no compelling a priori reason for the exclusive focus on this region. and it has been shown that it performs poorly for certain animal groups. To explore alternative mitochondrial barcoding regions. we compared the efficacy of the universal CO1 barcoding region with the other mitochondrial protein-coding genes in eutherian mammals. Four criteria were used for this comparison: the number of recovered species. sequence variability within and between species. resolution to taxonomic levels above that of species. and the degree of mutational saturation. Based on 1.179 mitochondrial genomes of eutherians. we found that the universal CO1 barcoding region is a good representative of mitochondrial genes as a whole because the high species-recovery rate (> 90%) was similar to that of other mitochondrial genes. and there were no significant differences in intra- or interspecific variability among genes. However. an overlap between intra- and interspecific variability was still problematic for all mitochondrial genes. Our results also demonstrated that any choice of mitochondrial gene for DNA barcoding failed to offer significant resolution at higher taxonomic levels. We suggest that the CO1 barcoding region. the universal DNA barcode. is preferred among the mitochondrial protein-coding genes as a molecular diagnostic at least for eutherian species identification.

Herpesviruses are a group of large. DNA viruses that are known to encode gene products that subvert their host's antiviral response. It is likely that OsHV-1 has also evolved similar strategies as its genome encodes genes with high homology to C. gigas inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) and an interferon-stimulated gene (termed CH25H). The first objective of this study was to simultaneously investigate the expression of C. gigas and OsHV-1 genes that share high sequence homology during an acute infection.

Crassostrea gigas. is becoming a valuable model for investigating antiviral defense in the Lophotrochozoa superphylum. In the past five years. improvements to laboratory-based experimental infection protocols using Ostreid herpesvirus I (OsHV-1) from naturally infected C. gigas combined with next-generation sequencing techniques has revealed that oysters have a complex antiviral response involving the activation of all major innate immune pathways. Experimental evidence indicates C. gigas utilizes an interferon-like response to limit OsHV-1 replication and spread. Oysters injected with a viral mimic (polyI: C) develop resistance to OsHV-1. Improved survival following polyI: C injection was found later in life (within-generational immune priming) and in the next generation (multi-generational immune priming). These studies indicate that the oyster’s antiviral defense system exhibits a form of innate immune-memory. An important priority is to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. This knowledge will motivate the development of practical and cost-effective treatments for improving oyster health in aquaculture.

Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1) causes severe mortalities of farmed C. gigas. Management of OsHV-1 has proven difficult. Oysters treated with poly(I:C) exhibit enhanced protection (EP) against OsHV-1. This chemical treatment is highly effective. but it is not feasible to treat every oyster on a farm. To circumvent this practical limitation. previous studies on arthropods have suggested that EP can be transferred from parents to their offspring (trans-generational EP. TGEP). This suggests that the treatment of relatively few parents could be used to produce large numbers of offspring with TGEP. Here. we investigated TGEP in oysters to test whether it might be used as a cost effective management tool to control OsHV-1.

Epidemiological field studies have also reported oyster age and other pathogens of the Vibrio genus are contributing factors to this syndrome. We undertook a controlled laboratory experiment to simultaneously investigate survival and immunological response of juvenile and adult C. gigas at different time-points post-infection with OsHV-1. Vibrio tasmaniensis LGP32 and V. aestuarianus. Our data corroborates epidemiological studies that juveniles are more susceptible to OsHV-1. whereas adults are more susceptible to Vibrio. We measured the expression of 102 immune-genes by high-throughput RT-qPCR. which revealed oysters have different transcriptional responses to OsHV-1 and Vibrio. The transcriptional response in the early stages of OsHV-1 infection involved genes related to apoptosis and the interferon-pathway. Transcriptional response to Vibrio infection involved antimicrobial peptides. heat shock proteins and galectins. Interestingly. oysters in the later stages of OsHV-1 infection had a transcriptional response that resembled an antibacterial response. which is suggestive of the oyster’s microbiome causing secondary infections (dysbiosis-driven pathology).

Lafont M. and Goncalves P. and Guo X. and Montagnani C. and Raftos D.,91,Development Comparative Immunology,,17-25,Elsevier,The oyster's immune system is capable of adapting upon exposure to a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to have an enhanced secondary response against the same type of pathogen. This has been demonstrated using poly(I:C) to elicit an antiviral response in the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) against Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1). Improved survival following exposure to poly(I:C) has been found in later life stages (within-generational immune priming) and in the next generation (transgenerational immune priming). The mechanism that the oyster uses to transfer immunity to the next generation is unknown. Here we show that oyster larvae have higher survival to OsHV-1 when their mothers. but not their fathers. are exposed to poly(I:C) prior to spawning. RNA-seq provided no evidence to suggest that parental exposure to poly(I:C) reconfigures antiviral gene expression in unchallenged larvae.

Gnathia africana Barnard. 1914. The natural fish hosts of this temporary parasite. the super klipfish Clinus superciliosus (Linnaeus. 1758). were exposed to gnathiid larvae in the laboratory. It was found that G. africana has three larval stages. consisting of three unfed (zuphea) and three fed (praniza) stages. First-. second-and third-stage zuphea larvae took an average of 2 h 18 min. 2 h 43 min and 10 h 8 min respectively to complete their feeding and the first-and second-stage praniza moulted at 8 and 10 days respectively into the next zuphea stage. Three to six days after its last blood meal. the sex of the third and final praniza stage could be determined by the presence of either a testis or two ovaries in the dorsal pereon. Male larvae moulted into adult males between 8 and 10 days post feeding. Female larvae moulted at approximately 17 days into adult females. Fertilisation of the eggs by the male took place within 24 hours of completion of the female moult.

Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. Institute of Parasitology,This paper reviews past. current and likely future research on the fish haemogregarine. Haemogregarina bigemina Laveran et Mesnil. 1901. Recorded from 96 species of fishes. across 70 genera and 34 families. this broad distribution for H. bigemina is questioned. In its type hosts and other fishes. the parasite undergoes intraerythrocytic binary fission. finally forming mature paired gamonts. An intraleukocytic phase is also reported. but not from the type hosts. This paper asks whether stages from the white cell series are truly H. bigemina. A future aim should be to compare the molecular constitution of so-called H. bigemina from a number of locations to determine whether all represent the same species. The transmission of H. bigemina between fishes is also considered. Past studies show that young fish acquire the haemogregarine when close to metamorphosis. but vertical and faecal-oral transmission seem unlikely. Some fish haemogregarines are leech-transmitted. but where fish populations with H. bigemina have been studied. these annelids are largely absent. However. haematophagous larval gnathiid isopods occur on such fishes and may be readily eaten by them. Sequential squashes of gnathiids from fishes with H. bigemina have demonstrated development of the haemogregarine in these isopods. Examination of histological sections through gnathiids is now underway to determine the precise development sites of the haemogregarine. particularly whether merozoites finally invade the salivary glands.

Phylogenetic studies have been dominated by examples derived from freshwater fishes. with few marine representatives. Furthermore. life cycle studies on marine fish trypanosomes have focused on those of the northern hemisphere. In this investigation. we have examined the life cycle and molecular taxonomy of a marine fish trypanosome from South Africa. To locate trypanosome stages. leeches were removed from fishes captured on the west and south coasts of South Africa. and fish blood films and leech squashes were Giemsa-stained and screened; leeches were also examined histologically. To determine whether trypanosome stages in fishes and leeches were of the same genotype. DNA was extracted from Giemsa-stained fish blood films and leech squashes. and from fish whole blood. Fragments of the 18S rRNA gene were amplified by PCR using trypanosome-specific primers and sequenced. Resulting sequence data were compared with each other and with published trypanosome 18S rDNA sequences. and used for phylogenetic analysis. Trypanosomes were detected in blood films from fishes of the families Clinidae. Blenniidae and Gobiidae. The flagellates ranged in size and staining properties within the films and across fish hosts.

Hooper,7,PLoS ONE,4,e35105,www.plosone.org,With the completion of a single unified classification. the Systema Porifera (SP) and subsequent development of an online species database. the World Porifera Database (WPD). we are now equipped to provide a first comprehensive picture of the global biodiversity of the Porifera. An introductory overview of the four classes of the Porifera is followed by a description of the structure of our main source of data for this paper. the WPD. From this we extracted numbers of all ‘known’ sponges to date: the number of valid Recent sponges is established at 8.553. with the vast majority. 83%. belonging to the class Demospongiae. We also mapped for the first time the species richness of a comprehensive set of marine ecoregions of the world. data also extracted from the WPD. Perhaps not surprisingly. these distributions appear to show a strong bias towards collection and taxonomy efforts. Only when species richness is accumulated into large marine realms does a pattern emerge that is also recognized in many other marine animal groups: high numbers in tropical regions. lesser numbers in the colder parts of the world oceans. Preliminary similarity analysis of a matrix of species and marine ecoregions extracted from the WPD failed to yield a consistent hierarchical pattern of ecoregions into marine provinces. Global sponge diversity information is mostly generated in regional projects and resources: results obtained demonstrate that regional approaches to analytical biogeography are at present more likely to achieve insights into the biogeographic history of sponges than a global perspective. which appears currently too ambitious.

In diploblasts. mitochondrial genes were found to evolve in a slower rate than their bilaterian counterparts. Therefore. diploblast CO1 gene trees repeatedly remained unresolved. which also raises doubts on the suitability of CO1 for DNA barcoding in these animals. The complete mitochondrial genome sequences from Anthozoa and recently from Porifera allow us to compare the resolution power of the 5′ partition. which has also been proposed as the standard marker for DNA barcoding. with a less frequently used partition further downstream. We report on the finding of significantly different substitution patterns of the downstream partition opposed to the 5′ partition.

Recent transgenerational studies have shown that for some marine species. exposure of adults to OA can facilitate positive carryover effects to their larval and juvenile offspring that help them to survive in acidifying oceanic conditions. But whether these positive carryover effects can persist into adulthood or the next generation is unknown. Here we tested whether positive carryover effects found in larvae of the oyster. Saccostrea glomerata following transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2. could persist into adulthood and whether subsequent transgenerational exposure of adults to elevated CO2 would facilitate similar adaptive responses in the next generation of larvae and juveniles. Following our previous transgenerational exposure of parental adults and first generation (F1) larvae to ambient (385 μatm) and elevated (856 μatm) CO2. newly settled F1 juveniles were transferred to the field at ambient CO2 for 14 months. until they reached reproductive maturity. At this time. the F1 adults were returned to the laboratory and the previous transgenerational CO2 exposure was repeated to produce F2 offspring. We found that the capacity of adults to regulate extracellular pH at elevated CO2 was improved if they had a prior history of transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2.

The highly diverse 185/333 gene family in the purple sea urchin encodes a family of closely related proteins of varying length and sequence composition. Subsets of small phagocytes and polygonal cells express 185/333 proteins with localization on the surface of the small phagocytes and within perinuclear vesicles in both cell types. In short-term cultures. coelomocytes form small aggregates that progress to syncytia that are thought to be equivalent to encapsulation in vivo. These aggregates were found to be enriched for 185/333-positive (185/333+) small phagocytes. In response to lipopolysaccharide challenge. coelomocytes transiently increased. including frequencies of both 185/333+ and 185/333-negative (185/333–) small phagocytes and 185/333+ polygonal cells.

We review here recent developments in molluscan antiviral immunity against viruses belonging to the order Herpesvirales. Emerging results suggest an interferon-like response and autophagy are involved in the antiviral defence of bivalves to viral infection. Multi-functional plasma proteins from gastropods and bivalves have been identified to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against mammalian viruses. The antiviral defences present in molluscs can be enhanced by genetic selection. as shown by the presence of oyster strains specifically resistant to ostreid herpesvirus type 1.

Brazil. including a checklist of Brazilian hydroids,1996,Alvaro E Migotto and Willem Vervoort,306,,,,Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum,Despite being one of the most common invertebrate groups of intertidal and sublittoral regions. hydroids are poorly known in Brazilian waters. Indeed. the coastline of eastern South America was considered by Cornelius (1992) to be one of the least studied regions on earth. with few data on the occurrence and distribution of hydroids (see Appendix for a checklist of hydroids from the Brazilian coast).

In the years following Vannucci's research there was an emphasis on the study of medusae (Moreira. 1973; Navas-Pereira. 1980). and a few papers on hydroids were published (Mayal. 1973. 1983; Narchi & Hebling. 1975; Moreira et al.. 1978. 1979; da Silveira & Migotto. 1984. 1991. 1992; Migotto & da Silveira. 1987; Pires et al.. 1992; Marques. 1993).

In an observational prospective study. one hundred and twenty-eight patients from the North Coast region of São Paulo State. Brazil were seen between 2002 and 2008. About 80% of these showed only local effects (erythema. edema. and pain) with small. less than 20 cm. oval or round skin marks and impressions from small tentacles. Approximately 20% of the victims had long. more than 20 cm. linear and crossed marks with frequent systemic phenomena. such as malaise. vomiting. dyspnea. and tachycardia. The former is compatible with the common hydromedusa from Southeast and Southern Brazil (Olindias sambaquiensis). The long linear marks with intense pain and systemic phenomena are compatible with envenoming by the box jellyfish Tamoya haplonema and Chiropsalmus quadrumanus and the hydrozoan Portuguese man-of-war (Physalis physalis). There was an association between skin marks and probable accident etiology. This simple observation rule can be indicative of severity. as the Cubozoa Class (box jellyfish) and Portuguese man-of-war cause the most severe accidents. In such cases. medical attention. including intensive care. is important. as the systemic manifestations can be associated with death.,True,5x3xBSkAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,47,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0036-46652010000100008&script=sci_arttext&tlng=pt,16054392866817577018,/scholar?cites=16054392866817577018,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0036-46652010000100008&script=sci_arttext&tlng=pt,0,0,0

Here. our objectives were to describe the marine fauna of the area of the port of São Sebastião (on the northern coast of the state of São Paulo. in the São Sebastião Channel. SSC) to detect introduced species. Descriptions of the faunal community of the SSC with respect to native and allochthonous (invasive or potentially so) diversity are lacking for all invertebrate groups. Sampling was carried out by specialists within each taxonomic group. in December 2009. following the protocol of the Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) in three areas with artificial structures as substrates. A total of 142 species were identified (61 native. 15 introduced. 62 cryptogenic. 4 not classified). of which 17 were Polychaeta (12. 1. 1. 3). 24 Ascidiacea (3. 6. 15. 0). 36 Bryozoa (17. 0. 18. 1). 27 Cnidaria (2. 1. 24. 0). 20 Crustacea (11. 4. 5. 0). 2 Entoprocta (native). 16 Mollusca (13. 3. 0. 0). Twelve species are new occurrences for the SSC. Among the introduced taxa. two are new for coastal Brazil. Estimates of introduced taxa are conservative as the results of molecular studies suggest that some species previously considered cryptogenic are indeed introduced. We emphasize that the large number of cryptogenic species illustrates the need for a long-term monitoring program. especially in areas most susceptible to bioinvasion. We conclude that rapid assessment studies. even in relatively wellknown regions. can be very useful for the detection of introduced species and we recommend that they be carried out on a larger scale in all ports with heavy ship traffic.,True,5x3xBSkAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC,44,https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/1750/175026114006.pdf,2810174042807080629,/scholar?cites=2810174042807080629,,https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/1750/175026114006.pdf,0,0,0

Nevertheless. interpretations of their evolutionary relationships have been in flux for over a decade. Recent analyses undermine the legitimacy of traditional suborders. families and genera. and suggest that a non-skeletal sister clade (Order Corallimorpharia) might be imbedded within the stony corals. However. these studies either sampled a relatively limited array of taxa or assembled trees from heterogeneous data sets. Here we provide a more comprehensive analysis of Scleractinia (127 species. 75 genera. 17 families) and various outgroups. based on two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase I. cytochrome b). with analyses of nuclear genes (ß-tubulin. ribosomal DNA) of a subset of taxa to test unexpected relationships. Eleven of 16 families were found to be polyphyletic. Strikingly. over one third of all families as conventionally defined contain representatives from the highly divergent “robust” and “complex” clades. However. the recent suggestion that corallimorpharians are true corals that have lost their skeletons was not upheld. Relationships were supported not only by mitochondrial and nuclear genes. but also often by morphological characters which had been ignored or never noted previously.

1140486,Cnidarian phylogenetic relationships as revealed by mitogenomics,2013,Ehsan Kayal and Béatrice Roure and Hervé Philippe and Allen G Collins and Dennis V Lavrov,13,BMC evolutionary biology,1,1-18,BioMed Central,Cnidaria (corals. sea anemones. hydroids. jellyfish) is a phylum of relatively simple aquatic animals characterized by the presence of the cnidocyst: a cell containing a giant capsular organelle with an eversible tubule (cnida). Species within Cnidaria have life cycles that involve one or both of the two distinct body forms. a typically benthic polyp. which may or may not be colonial. and a typically pelagic mostly solitary medusa. The currently accepted taxonomic scheme subdivides Cnidaria into two main assemblages: Anthozoa (Hexacorallia + Octocorallia) – cnidarians with a reproductive polyp and the absence of a medusa stage – and Medusozoa (Cubozoa. Hydrozoa. Scyphozoa. Staurozoa) – cnidarians that usually possess a reproductive medusa stage. Hypothesized relationships among these taxa greatly impact interpretations of cnidarian character evolution. We expanded the sampling of cnidarian mitochondrial genomes. particularly from Medusozoa. to reevaluate phylogenetic relationships within Cnidaria. Our phylogenetic analyses based on a mitochogenomic dataset support many prior hypotheses. including monophyly of Hexacorallia. Octocorallia. Medusozoa. Cubozoa. Staurozoa. Hydrozoa. Carybdeida.

Further. cnidarian jellyfish comprise an important component of modern marine planktonic ecosystems. Here we report on exceptionally preserved cnidarian jellyfish fossils from the Middle Cambrian (∼505 million years old) Marjum Formation of Utah. These are the first described Cambrian jellyfish fossils to display exquisite preservation of soft part anatomy including detailed features of structures interpreted as trailing tentacles and subumbrellar and exumbrellar surfaces. If the interpretation of these preserved characters is correct. their presence is diagnostic of modern jellyfish taxa. These new discoveries may provide insight into the scope of cnidarian diversity shortly after the Cambrian radiation. and would reinforce the notion that important taxonomic components of the modern planktonic realm were in place by the Cambrian period.,True,5OHqzOAAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,145,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001121,6660013176836610197,/scholar?cites=6660013176836610197,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001121,0,0,0

However. the evolutionary rate of Ceriantharia. one of the most enigmatic “orders” within Anthozoa. has never been specifically examined. In this study. the divergence of mitochondrial DNA of Ceriantharia was compared to members of other Anthozoa and Medusozoa groups. In addition. nuclear markers were used to check the relative phylogenetic position of Ceriantharia in relation to other Cnidaria members. The results demonstrated a pattern of divergence of mitochondrial DNA completely different from those estimated for other anthozoans. and phylogenetic analyses indicate that Ceriantharia is not included within hexacorallians in most performed analyses.

This is probably due to the low genetic variation found among the molecular markers (primarily mitochondrial) commonly used for Anthozoa. Ceriantharia is an anthozoan group that has not been tested for genetic divergence at the species level. Recently. all three Atlantic species described for the genus Isarachnanthus of Atlantic Ocean. were deemed synonyms based on morphological simmilarities of only one species: Isarachnanthus maderensis. Here. we aimed to verify whether genetic relationships (using COI. 16S. ITS1 and ITS2 molecular markers) confirmed morphological affinities among members of Isarachnanthus from different regions across the Atlantic Ocean. Results from four DNA markers were completely congruent and revealed that two different species exist in the Atlantic Ocean. The low identification success and substantial overlap between intra and interspecific COI distances render the Anthozoa unsuitable for DNA barcoding. which is not true for Ceriantharia. In addition. genetic divergence within and between Ceriantharia species is more similar to that found in Medusozoa (Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa) than Anthozoa and Porifera that have divergence rates similar to typical metazoans. The two genetic species could also be separated based on micromorphological characteristics of their cnidomes. Using a specimen of Isarachnanthus bandanensis from Pacific Ocean as an outgroup. it was possible to estimate the minimum date of divergence between the clades.

Cnidaria are arguably the most ancient phylum of the extant metazoa that are venomous and such provide a definitive ancestral anchor to examine the evolution of this trait. Here we compare predicted toxins from the translated genome of the coral Acropora digitifera to putative toxins revealed by proteomic analysis of soluble proteins discharged from nematocysts. to determine the extent to which gene duplications contribute to venom innovation in this reef-building coral species.

A total of 55 potential toxin encoding genes could be predicted from the A. digitifera genome. of which 36 (65 %) had likely arisen by gene duplication as evinced using the HHCompare tool and verified using two standard phylogeny methods. Surprisingly. only 22 % (12/55) of the potential toxin repertoire could be detected following rigorous proteomic analysis. for which only half (6/12) of the toxin proteome could be accounted for as peptides encoded by the gene duplicates.

1140522,Cleaner shrimp (Caridea: Palaemonidae) associated with scyphozoan jellyfish,2008,PeriCLimeneS PaiVai,58,Vie et milieu-Life and Environment,2,133-140,,Shrimp are found in association with many hosts (sponges. anthozoans. mollusks. echinoids. ascidians and fish). Shrimp are rarely observed in association with jellyfish. The interaction between the cleaner shrimp Periclimenes paivai and jellyfish is poorly known. with only one published report for Brazilian waters. We add new information about this association. based on field and laboratory observations. Shrimp were collected from three locations on the coast of São Paulo State (Cananéia. Santos and São Sebastião) and from two species of scyphozoan medusae: Chrysaora lactea and Lychnorhiza lucerna. We classify the association as facultative commensalism. since the shrimp gain protection and probably feed on mucus produced by the jellyfish. The maximum carapace length of the shrimp collected was 9.2 mm. Medusa bell diameter ranged between about 10 and 19 cm for C. lactea and between 4.5 and 25 cm for L. lucerna. We also provide a list of records of Periclimenes in association with different scyphomedusae. and additional information on the size and coloration of P. paivai.,True,PKB4ZtwAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C,30,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Martinelli-Filho/publication/216871453_Cleaner_shrimp_Caridea_Palaemonidae_associated_with_scyphozoan_jellyfish/links/02e7e527a98fda7617000000/Cleaner-shrimp-Caridea-Palaemonidae-associated-with-scyphozoan-jellyfish.pdf,12363351873926509464,/scholar?cites=12363351873926509464,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Martinelli-Filho/publication/216871453_Cleaner_shrimp_Caridea_Palaemonidae_associated_with_scyphozoan_jellyfish/links/02e7e527a98fda7617000000/Cleaner-shrimp-Caridea-Palaemonidae-associated-with-scyphozoan-jellyfish.pdf,0,0,0

Hawaii and Florida. which are related to specimens from the Red Sea (Cassiopea andromeda). We hypothesize that the presence of C. andromeda in Brazil is due to an invasion event. as the scyphistomae were found growing over the known invasive ascidian Styela plicata.

Marques & Collins (2004) concluded that conulariids (?Ediacaran‐Triassic) are an extinct group of medusozoan cnidarians most closely related to Stauromedusae. However. only six of the 87 characters used by these authors can be observed in conulariid fossils. Rescoring the character states of conulariids in a conservative manner yields a new hypothesis for the phylogenetic position of conulariids. namely that they are the sister group of the scyphozoan order Coronatae rather than Stauromedusae. which is revealed as the earliest diverging lineage of Medusozoa. This new hypothesis also implies several different sequences of character evolution within Cnidaria.

A total of 245 gastropod and 485 bivalve shells were collected and analyzed. Complete valves. showing small chipped margins. dominated the studied shell material. The periostracum was present in the great majority of the mollusk shells. and the ligament was preserved in more than 50% of the studied bivalves. Gastropod shells were intensively (50% to 80%) encrusted by periphyton and Potamolithus egg capsules. Corrasion is one of the main taphonomic signatures exhibited by the mollusk shells. and are represented by small to large pits and holes found in the internal and external shell surfaces. Some evidences indicate that these were acquired soon after death or even during life. Clearly. the presence/absence and the degree of taphonomic alteration of the shells were mediated by intrinsic factors. Some life habits make difficult the determination of post-mortem nature of some taphonomic signatures. In addition. taphonomic signatures do not vary predictably in shells from thanatocoenoses found in the straight or meandering channels. In part. this is due to the reworking of the Pleistocene mollusk shells from fossil-rich layers found in the sandstones of point bar deposits of the meandering channel.

Their preservation seems to be associated to unusual preservational circumstances. In fact. the fossiliferous sediments rich in conulariids were deposited under platformal or shallow water conditions in a muddy epeiric sea. punctuated by storm events. The exam of 28 oriented blocks (-5400 cm3) of siltstone or mudstones. including 29 specimens of conulariids. indicates that they are preserved according to the following preservational modes: Vertically oriented conulariids (1) with aperture-up. 90-70 to the bedding plane. in massive or less bioturbated siltstones. inclined (2) or horizontally oriented conulariids (3) in a completely bioturbated siltstone or mudstones. rich in Zoophycos. Vertically oriented specimens are interpreted as autochthonous elements. indicating the abrupt burial of living invertebrates. Thus. an attached epifaunal mode of life is inferred for these specimens. Horizontally oriented specimens correspond to disrupted elements. particularly by the biological activity within the substrate. during and after the rapid sediment deposition. associated to storm events. Specimens vertically preserved directly adjacent to horizontally oriented conulariids in zones of intense sediment bioturbation support this idea.

Série Zoologia,4,453-465,Museu de Ciências Naturais,This study represents one of the first contributions to the knowledge on the quantitative fidelity of the recent freshwater molluscan assemblages in subtropical rivers. Thanatocoenoses and biocoenoses were studied in straight and meandering to braided sectors. in the middle course of the Touro Passo River. a fourth-order tributary of the Uruguay River. located in the westernmost part of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. Samplings were carried out through quadrats of 5 m². five in each sector. A total area of 50 m² was sampled. Samplings were also made in a lentic environment (abandoned meander). with intermittent communication with the Touro Passo River. aiming to record out-of-habitat shell transportation from the lentic communities to the main river channel. The results show that. despite the frequent oscillation of the water level. the biocoenosis of the Touro Passo River shows high ecological fidelity and undergoes little influence from the lentic vicinal environments. The taxonomic composition and some features of the structure of communities. especially the dominant species. also reflect some ecological differences between the two main sectors sampled. such as the complexity of habitats in the meandering-sector. Regarding the quantitative fidelity. 60% of the species found alive were also found dead and 47.3% of the species found dead were also found alive. at river-scale. However. 72% of the dead individuals belong to species also found alive. This value might be related with the good rank order correlation obtained for live/dead assemblages.

However. molecular data can be a useful tool to elucidate medusozoan life cycles by tying together different life history stages.  Methodology/Principal Findings Genetic data from fast-evolving molecular markers (mitochondrial 16S. nuclear ITS1. and nuclear ITS2) show that animals that were presumed to be a hydrozoan. Microhydrula limopsicola (Limnomedusae. Microhydrulidae). are actually an early stage of the life cycle of the staurozoan Haliclystus antarcticus (Stauromedusae. Lucernariidae).  Conclusions/Significance Similarity between the haplotypes of three markers of Microhydrula limopsicola and Haliclystus antarcticus settles the identity of these taxa. expanding our understanding of the staurozoan life cycle. which was thought to be more straightforward and simple. A synthetic discussion of prior observations makes sense of the morphological. histological and behavioral similarities/congruence between Microhydrula and Haliclystus. The consequences are likely to be replicated in other medusozoan groups.

A review of stauromedusan population biology,2012,Lucilia S Miranda and André C Morandini and Antonio C Marques,690,Hydrobiologia,1,57-67,Springer Netherlands,The study of “jellyfish blooms” provides important data toward determining the causes and consequences of these phenomena; however. the definition of “bloom” remains controversial and different concepts have been adopted in recent works. By addressing the biological and convenience definitions. this study tested the adequacy of the different concepts of “blooms” for the Class Staurozoa (Cnidaria). From seasonal monitoring data of some species of Staurozoa. we concluded that stauromedusae bloom if we used the biological concept of “bloom”. which considers the life cycle and resulting changes in the abundances of these animals. By contrast. the small. benthic. inconspicuous. and non-harmful stauromedusae do not bloom if we use the convenience concept of “bloom”. which constrains the events to those that humans can observe and that cause damage to human activities.

Evidence from the muscular system reconsidered,2015,LS Miranda and Allen Gilbert Collins and Antonio C Marques,282,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,1803,20142396,The Royal Society,Haootia quadriformis was described from the lower Fermeuse Formation of the Bonavista Peninsula of Newfoundland (approx. 560 Ma) and its numerous regularly aligned impressions were interpreted as evidence of muscular tissue ([1. figs 1a and 3b]). Consequently. this fossil could represent the earliest preservation of metazoan musculature in the geological record. Although Liu et al.[1] identified H. quadriformis as a cnidarian. the species was not decisively assigned to any particular class. but potentially within Medusozoa [1]. The fossil was predominantly compared to staurozoans (Cnidaria) based on an assertion of consistent ‘positioning of muscular fibres in the calyx of modern Staurozoa’[1. p. 6]. Indeed. the hypothesized general morphology of the body of H. quadriformis ([1. fig. 3b]) is similar to that of extant stauromedusae: a calyx with marginal branches (arms) and a peduncle with pedal disc (figure 1 a;[2 …,True,eiA8YXEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,19,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2014.2396,7522962918028226844,/scholar?cites=7522962918028226844,,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2014.2396,0,0,0

Most characters. and particularly internal anatomy. have neither been explored for the class Staurozoa. nor broadly applied in its taxonomy and classification. Recently. a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis was derived for Staurozoa. allowing for the first broad histological comparative study of staurozoan taxa. This study uses comparative histology to describe the body plans of nine staurozoan species. inferring functional and evolutionary aspects of internal morphology based on the current phylogeny of Staurozoa. We document rarely-studied structures. such as ostia between radial pockets. intertentacular lobules. gametoducts. pad-like adhesive structures. and white spots of nematocysts (the last four newly proposed putative synapomorphies for Staurozoa). Two different regions of nematogenesis are documented. This work falsifies the view that the peduncle region of stauromedusae only retains polypoid characters; metamorphosis from stauropolyp to stauromedusa occurs both at the apical region (calyx) and basal region (peduncle). Intertentacular lobules. observed previously in only a small number of species. are shown to be widespread. Similarly. gametoducts were documented in all analyzed genera. both in males and females. thereby elucidating gamete release. Finally. ostia connecting adjacent gastric radial pockets appear to be universal for Staurozoa.

Staurozoa) in Brazil: first record outside its type locality in South Africa,2012,Lucília S Miranda and Maria A Haddad and Claudia E Mills and Antonio C Marques,3158,Zootaxa,1,60-64,,Staurozoa is a class of Cnidaria comprising stalked. benthic jellyfishes (Marques & Collins 2004) that encompasses about 51 species (Mills 1999; Zagal et al. 2011). Stauromedusae are distributed worldwide. but are more common in temperate and polar waters (Mills & Hirano 2007). Taxonomic knowledge of these cnidarians is inadequate. as is information on their biology and ecology. probably because of their cryptic habit and general inconspicuousness (Mills & Hirano 2007). Consequently. scarcity of material renders their taxonomy even more difficult. demanding basic knowledge of their life cycle (eg. Miranda et al. 2010) and intraspecific morphological variation (eg. Miranda et al. 2009). Revisions of unique records of unidentified species (eg. Lucernariopsis from India by Panikkar 1944). and more complete studies of species known only from original descriptions. sometimes based on few individuals (eg.. Kishinouyea hawaiiensis Edmondson). are necessary and can produce interesting information.

1140565,Eyes in Staurozoa (Cnidaria): a review,2019,Lucília Souza Miranda and Allen Gilbert Collins,7,PeerJ,,e6693,PeerJ Inc.,The presence of dark pigment spots associated with primary tentacles (or structures derived from them. i.e.. rhopalioids) in Staurozoa was recently overlooked in a study on the evolution of cnidarian eyes (defined as a “region made of photoreceptor cells adjacent to pigment cells”. irrespective of image formation. i.e.. including all photoreceptive organs). Review of old and recent literature on Staurozoa shows that dark pigment spots are present in virtually all species of Manania. as well as some species of Haliclystus. Stylocoronella. and probably Calvadosia. The known ultrastructure of ocelli seems to be compatible with light perception. but no immediate response to changes in light intensity have been observed in the behavior of staurozoans. Therefore. although further studies addressing photic behavior are required. we discuss an earlier hypothesis that the dark spots in some stauromedusae may be related to synchronous spawning. as well as the possible sensorial function of rhopalioids. Observations summarized here suggest a possible ninth independent origin of eyes in Cnidaria. within a lineage of benthic medusae. Alternatively. documented similarity across medusae of Cubozoa. Scyphozoa. and Staurozoa—with eyes being topologically associated with primary tentacles in each of these taxa—could indicate shared ancestry and a single origin of eyes in this clade known as Acraspeda.

Results suggest that articulated and disarticulated specimens of Corumbella from the Ediacaran of Brazil.

Corumbellids had a thick but flexible theca and probably lived with their basalmost part anchored in the sediment. much like Conotubus.

Specifically. features previously homologized with the corners of conulariid thecae may actually be homologous to the conulariid midlines. Under this new interpretation. the corners of the Vendoconularia theca were sulcate. and the midline of each face was non‐sulcate and flanked by a pair of low internal carinae.

Discoveries of skeletal structures and specimens preserved in situ. coupled with cladistic analyses. have led to a revival of Kiderlen's (1937) hypothesis that conulariids were polypoidscyphozoans or a sister taxon of this class. Until 1979. research on conulariids centered on the description of new species and on the erection of subgroups using phenetic approaches. Few papers addressed the paleobiology and phylogenetic affinities of conulariids. and none em-ployed cladistics. In contrast. the 1980's saw the publication of major papers on the paleoecology of conulariids. and during this decade the hypothesis that conulariids were benthic organisms was corroborated.

Intergeneric limits were also tested using comparisons with specimens of the genus Campanularia. We performed DNA analyses using the mitochondrial genes 16S and COI and the nuclear ITS1 and ITS2 regions.

Southern lapwing behaviours and their relation with flock size were studied. as well as the relationship between the frequency of behaviours and the period of the day. Results showed that the proportion of time spent in foraging and vigilance was higher during the morning. when small groups were more common. and decreased from midday on. when group size increased. Maintenance and inactivity (sleeping) behaviours presented the opposite pattern. Correlation between flock size and period of the day. and their similar effects on bird behaviour may be evidence that groups of different sizes could have different functions throughout the day.

Difficulties in interpreting morphological variations have posed many taxonomic problems. since intraspecific morphological variations are often misinterpreted as interspecific variations and vice-versa. hampering species delimitation. This study reviews the patterns of morphological variation in the Medusozoa. to evaluate how different interpretations of the levels of variation may influence the understanding of the patterns of diversification in the group. Additionally. we provide an estimate of the cryptic diversity in the Hydrozoa. based on COI sequences deposited in GenBank.

Caprellids are known to benefit from the association with hydroids. but it is unclear if epiphytic hydroids affect their abundance. In this study. we investigated if caprellid abundance is related to epiphytic hydroid abundance on Sargassum cymosum. and whether this is related to caprellids’ clinging behavior. We found that hydroid abundance had a positive effect on caprellid abundance. irrespective of species. sex. developmental and reproductive stages of caprellids. with the exception of Caprella scaura that present maternal care behavior. Experiments also showed that caprellids are more abundant on fronds of Sargassum with hydroids.

This study evaluated the influence of Sargassum epibiosis by epiphytic algae and hydroids on the occurrence of caprellid amphipods. The sampling was carried out on Sargassum beds of Ubatuba beaches. northern coast of São Paulo state. in October 2006. The presence of epiphytic algae and hydroids on Sargassum fronds was evaluated using five cover categories. Epiphytic algae showed significant cover differences among beaches. while hydroids occurrence was more uniform. without significant differences on the levels of epibiosis. None of the caprellid species identified showed differences in its density among beaches.

However. Lovenella gracilis apparently does not have the demarcating line under light microscopy–therefore. the resurrection of the genus Dipleuron Brooks. 1882 was proposed to accommodate this species. The goal of this study is to redescribe the polyp of L. gracilis trying to resolve this doubtful taxonomical “status”. Fertile colonies were collected in the intertidal zone of Rio Grande do Norte and Santa Catarina States. representing the first record of the species for the South Atlantic. Scanning electron microcopy of L. gracilis has shown a tenuous demarcation between operculum and hydrotheca. corroborating its position in the genus Lovenella.

In 2011. the dissertation of El Beshbeeshy was published in accordance with Article 8 of the ICZN. Several species-group names appearing in that work nevertheless fail to fully comply with certain articles of the code. The goal of this contribution is to review the nomenclatural availability of the names of those 30 new taxa. and to clearly establish the current status of El Beshbeeshy's material. Two of them were made available in 1999 as part of studies other than those of El Beshbeeshy. and correct authorship and date is here noted. Twenty-one of the nomina nuda were made available in a work published by El Beshbeeshy in 2011. although some constitute junior synonyms. Six of the new species-group names appearing in both the 1991 and 2011 works. established following a literature review of Patagonian species. were proposed without re-description. or designation of name-bearing types. or locations of such types.

Entretanto. muitos problemas taxonômicos surgem a partir das dificuldades em interpretar os níveis de variação. já que variações intraespecíficas muitas vezes são interpretadas de forma imprecisa como interespecíficas. e vice-versa. Neste estudo. revisamos os padrões de variação morfológica em Cnidaria Medusozoa. avaliando sua influência na taxonomia e diversidade do grupo. Seguindo essa abordagem. investigamos as relações filogenéticas da subordem Proboscoida. testando a relevância dos caracteres morfológicos diagnósticos tradicionais para a delimitação de linhagens em vários níveis taxonômicos. Além disso. avaliamos os seus padrões de variação morfológica. contrastando dados morfométricos e filogenéticos. Ficou claro que a variação intraespecífica em Medusozoa está frequentemente correlacionada com a variação interespecífica. e existe sobreposição entre os diferentes níveis. Igualmente. mostramos que a diversidade de espécies em Medusozoa está imprecisamente estimada. e existe ainda um grande potencial para a descoberta de espécies crípticas em Hydrozoa.

The continued confusion over the correct name for this species led us to provide a redescription of d’Orbigny’s type of Cellepora subtorquata. and to make comparisons with other species of Watersipora. We show that the majority of specimens assigned to W. subovoidea (d’Orbigny. 1852) are morphologically distinct from the recently erected neotype of W. subovoidea; these specimens are here reidentified as Watersipora subtorquata. Other specimens previously assigned to W. subtorquata belong to W. subatra (Ortmann. 1890). described originally from Japan. Owing these inconsistences. we suggest setting aside the neotype of Watersipora subovoidea. which is based on Busk’s Lepralia cucullata and is not from the same locality as d’Orbigny’s type. Watersipora cucullata is redescribed and figured using Busk’s specimens; the species is known from the Mediterranean. including the Adriatic. Three other species—Watersipora atrofusca (Busk. 1856). Watersipora aterrima (Ortmann. 1890) and Watersipora nigra (Canu & Bassler. 1930)—are also refigured. Watersipora edmondsoni Soule & Soule. 1975 is synonymised with W. subtorquata (d’Orbigny).

Here. our objectives were to describe the marine fauna of the area of the port of São Sebastião (on the northern coast of the state of São Paulo. in the São Sebastião Channel. SSC) to detect introduced species. Descriptions of the faunal community of the SSC with respect to native and allochthonous (invasive or potentially so) diversity are lacking for all invertebrate groups. Sampling was carried out by specialists within each taxonomic group. in December 2009. following the protocol of the Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) in three areas with artificial structures as substrates. A total of 142 species were identified (61 native. 15 introduced. 62 cryptogenic. 4 not classified). of which 17 were Polychaeta (12. 1. 1. 3). 24 Ascidiacea (3. 6. 15. 0). 36 Bryozoa (17. 0. 18. 1). 27 Cnidaria (2. 1. 24. 0). 20 Crustacea (11. 4. 5. 0). 2 Entoprocta (native). 16 Mollusca (13. 3. 0. 0). Twelve species are new occurrences for the SSC. Among the introduced taxa. two are new for coastal Brazil. Estimates of introduced taxa are conservative as the results of molecular studies suggest that some species previously considered cryptogenic are indeed introduced. We emphasize that the large number of cryptogenic species illustrates the need for a long-term monitoring program. especially in areas most susceptible to bioinvasion. We conclude that rapid assessment studies. even in relatively wellknown regions. can be very useful for the detection of introduced species and we recommend that they be carried out on a larger scale in all ports with heavy ship traffic.,True,-5WTEJIAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,44,https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/1750/175026114006.pdf,2810174042807080629,/scholar?cites=2810174042807080629,,https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/1750/175026114006.pdf,0,0,0

1140657,Evidence for polyphyly of the genus Scrupocellaria (Bryozoa: Candidae) based on a phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters,2014,Leandro M Vieira and Mary E Spencer Jones and Judith E Winston and Alvaro E Migotto and Antonio C Marques,9,PloS one,4,e95296,Public Library of Science,The bryozoan genus Scrupocellaria comprises about 80 species in the family Candidae. We propose a hypothesis for the phylogenetic relationships among species assigned to Scrupocellaria to serve as framework for a phylogenetic classification using 35 morphological characters. Our results suggest that the genus Scrupocellaria is polyphyletic. Scrupocellaria s. str. is redefined according to four morphological features: vibracular chamber with a curved setal groove. ooecium with a single ectooecial fenestra. two axillary vibracula. and a membranous operculum with a distinct distal rim. Thus. the genus includes only 11 species: Scrupocellaria aegeensis. Scrupocellaria delilii. Scrupocellaria harmeri. Scrupocellaria incurvata. Scrupocellaria inermis. Scrupocellaria intermedia. Scrupocellaria jullieni. Scrupocellaria minuta. Scrupocellaria puelcha. Scrupocellaria scrupea. and Scrupocellaria scruposa.

The two species. originally described from material collected by the ‘Challenger’expedition but synonymized by later authors. now have their status fixed by means of the selection of lectotypes. morphological observations and analyses of DNA sequences described here.

They have association to artificial structures as main mechanism of dispersal. including ships. which facilitates their introduction to new environments. The detection of exotic species is important to prevent new introductions and to propose management strategies of marine areas. Thus. after analyzing and discussing local and global criteria of exotic species. an account of exotic bryozoans from Brazil is presented. including 12 classified as exotic (six established and six detected) and 17 classified as potentially exotic (cryptogenic). Three species have been reported causing economic or environmental impacts worldwide. Of those. Membraniporopsis tubigera is known to cause economic impacts on the Brazilian coast.

Springer International Publishing, Cham",,,,The Southwestern Atlantic Ocean is the final Brazilian maritime frontier. The Brazilian authorities refer to this marine area as the “Blue Amazon.” being rich in biodiversity and ecosystem services and similar in extension to the country’s rainforest. This area is possibly one of the most important benthic biodiversity hotspots in the world; however. there is a lack of scientific knowledge about its marine biodiversity. Interestingly. these benthic communities generate threedimensional structures along the Brazilian coast. similar to the trees in the Amazon rainforest. The Brazilian marine animal forests (BRAF) in the “Blue Amazon” can be compared to their rainforest counterpart: an ecosystem with high diversity but relatively unknown. This chapter presents a review of the environmental characteristics and benthic habitats along the tropical coast of Brazil (coral reefs. intertidal sandstone reefs. benthic communities in rocky shores. continental shelf communities. oceanic islands. etc.). Furthermore. it presents synthetic information regarding the ecology and diversity of the benthic suspension feeders (sponges. scleractinian corals. octocorals. zoanthids. mollusks. ascidians. and bryozoans) in Southwestern Atlantic. Major knowledge gaps remain the baseline research on benthic communities in mesophotic and deep-sea reef ecosystems in this marine region.

Young turtles move from oceanic to neritic habitats. from pelagic to benthic feeding and from an omnivorous to an herbivorous diet. However. whether this pattern applies elsewhere in the range of the species is not known.

Because the plankton production that drives forage fish also drives jellyfish production. these taxa often overlap in space. time. and diet in coastal ecosystems. This overlap likely leads to predatory and competitive interactions. as jellyfish are effective predators of fish early life stages and zooplankton. The trophic interplay between these groups is made more complex by the harvest of forage fish. which presumably releases jellyfish from competition and is hypothesized to lead to an increase in their production.

1140698,Pectins. endopolygalacturonases. and bioenergy,2016,Mariana BG Latarullo and Eveline QP Tavares and Gabriel Padilla and Débora CC Leite and Marcos S Buckeridge,7,,,1401,Frontiers,The precise disassembly of the extracellular matrix of some plant species used as feedstocks for bioenergy production continues to be a major barrier to reach reasonable cost effective bioethanol production. One solution has been the use of pretreatments. which can be effective. but increase even more the cost of processing and also lead to loss of cell wall materials that could otherwise be used in industry. Although pectins are known to account for a relatively low proportion of walls of grasses. their role in recalcitrance to hydrolysis has been shown to be important. In this mini-review. we examine the importance of pectins for cell wall hydrolysis highlighting the work associated with bioenergy. Here we focus on the importance of endopolygalacturonases (EPGs) discovered to date. The EPGs catalogued by CAZy were screened. revealing that most sequences. as well as the scarce structural work performed with EPGs. are from fungi (mostly Aspergillus niger). The comparisons among the EPG from different microorganisms. suggests that EPGs from bacteria and grasses display higher similarity than each of them with fungi. This compilation strongly suggests that structural and functional studies of EPGs. mainly from plants and bacteria. should be a priority of research regarding the use of pectinases for bioenergy production purposes.,True,gdC6e6MAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,36,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01401/full,8840882644371706750,/scholar?cites=8840882644371706750,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01401/full,0,0,0

Treatment is hampered by the organism’s innate antibiotic resistance and the disease’s non-pathognomic presentation. Recently. added attention has been given to this organism due to its classification as a potential biowarfare agent. Therefore. methods of preventing acquisition of infection are needed. We investigated antagonism between Burkholderia spp and B. pseudomallei derived from the same ecological niche in a melioidosis endemic region in Papua New Guinea. Isolates of environmentally derived non-pseudomallei Burkholderia spp (n= 16) were screened for antibiosis against 27 B. pseudomallei isolates. Three isolates subsequently identified as B. ubonensis produced specific antagonistic activity against all B. pseudomallei isolates tested. The antagonistic compound in a cell-free state was obtained from a representative producing strain. with subsequent biological characterization revealing a pepsin sensitive peptide moiety consistent with a bacteriocin-like compound. To our knowledge. this is the first report of antagonistic activity demonstrated by near-neighbor Burkholderia against B. pseudomallei.

Previous studies in Papua New Guinea have demonstrated autochthonous melioidosis in Balimo. Western province. In contrast to other regions of endemicity. isolates recovered from both environmental and clinical sources demonstrate narrow genetic diversity over large spatial and temporal scales.   Methodology/Principal Findings We employed molecular typing techniques to determine the phylogenetic relationships of these isolates to each other and to others worldwide to aid in understanding the origins of the Papua New Guinean isolates. Multi-locus sequence typing of the 39 isolates resolved three unique sequence types. Phylogenetic reconstruction and Structure analysis determined that all isolates were genetically closer to those from Australia than those from Southeast Asia. Gene cluster analysis however. identified a Yersinia-like fimbrial gene cluster predominantly found among Burkholderia pseudomallei derived from Southeast Asia. Higher resolution VNTR typing and phylogenetic reconstruction of the Balimo isolates resolved 24 genotypes with long branch lengths. These findings are congruent with long term persistence in the region and a high level of environmental stability.   Conclusions/Significance Given that anthropogenic influence has been hypothesized as a mechanism for the dispersal of B. pseudomallei. these findings correlate with limited movement of the indigenous people in the region.

Gel electrophoresis showed that CosD formed stable complexes with plasmid DNA under conditions where daunorubicin (Dn) and doxorubicin (Dx) dissociated to some extent during the experiments. The footprint and stability of CosD complexed with 10- and 16 mer DNA was investigated using several applications of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). ESI-MS binding profiles showed that fewer CosD molecules bound to the sequences than Dn or Dx. In agreement with this. ESI-MS analysis of nuclease digestion products of the complexes showed that CosD protected the DNA to a greater extent than Dn or Dx.

In southern Brazil. granite is the main rock forming natural rocky walls that are available for encrusting organisms. In this study we tested whether granite selectively influences recruitment and impedes colonization by introduced and cryptogenic species that are already established on artificial substrates within the region. Plates of rough cut granite and of polyethylene were made available each month under a pier at a yacht club in Paranaguá Bay. A community is already established on concrete columns and fiber glass floats on the piers. After one. two and twelve months. the faunal composition of the plates was compared between the two treatments and other artificial substrates.

In yeast filtrations. the twisted fiber performed similar to the round fiber and better than the structured fiber. Among the three fibers. during yeast filtrations the critical flux for irreversibility was highest for the twisted fiber. The Reynolds number had little effect on the critical fluxes for particle deposition. which was attributed to the strong adsorption of yeast particles on the membrane.

Descriptions of the faunal community of the SSC with respect to native and allochthonous (invasive or potentially so) diversity are lacking for all invertebrate groups. Sampling was carried out by specialists within each taxonomic group. in December 2009. following the protocol of the Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) in three areas with artificial structures as substrates.

Twelve species are new occurrences for the SSC. Among the introduced taxa. two are new for coastal Brazil. Estimates of introduced taxa are conservative as the results of molecular studies suggest that some species previously considered cryptogenic are indeed introduced. We emphasize that the large number of cryptogenic species illustrates the need for a long-term monitoring program. especially in areas most susceptible to bioinvasion.

Stauromedusae are distributed worldwide. but are more common in temperate and polar waters (Mills & Hirano 2007). Taxonomic knowledge of these cnidarians is inadequate. as is information on their biology and ecology. probably because of their cryptic habit and general inconspicuousness (Mills & Hirano 2007). Consequently. scarcity of material renders their taxonomy even more difficult. demanding basic knowledge of their life cycle (eg. Miranda et al. 2010) and intraspecific morphological variation (eg.

Due to a seven-fold reduction of intragenic recombination frequency in the ade6 region of pat1-114 diploids. physical analysis of recombination has not been possible.

1140760,Review of the family Halopterididae (Hydrozoa. Cnidaria),1997,Peter Schuchert and Willem Vervoort,,,,,Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum,Halopterididae are a widespread family of marine thecate hydroids occurring in all seas. Some are also frequently encountered in shallow waters and popular faunistic identification guides regularly contain some Halopterididae. However. this study was started after an attempt to identify some Mediterranean samples made it evident that many species are not properly identifiable and that revisions are needed. The literature also is scattered widely and in publications that are difficult to access for the average institute. This study thus emphasises aspects of species recognition and identification; the taxonomy at the generic level is treated superficially only. A revision of taxa above the level of species in Halopterididae can only be made after a thorough phylogenetic analysis has become available. Such a study will be presented in a separate publication because it must be embedded in a broader taxonomie framework including also the other plumulariids. An excellent historic review and synonymy of some of the generic names can be found in Calder (in press); Millard (1975) and Bouillon (1995) too provide many synonyms. Limitations of resources and availability of material did not allow to describe and figure all species of the family. Therefore. emphasis was placed on the more important genera Antennella and Halopteris. The distributional range of the species is also discussed briefly as re-examination of material used by other authors showed an alarmingly high number of cases in which the material was incorrectly identified.

Two early Permian formations are present in the State of São Paulo. Brazil: Tatuí (the oldest) and Irati. Two members make up the Irati Formation-the Taquaral (the oldest) and Assistência. This paper discusses the facies of the upper Tatuí Formation and Taquaral Member. and their fossil content. mainly at the Ponte Nova Farm. This locality exhibits well-preserved outcrops of both units. with informative data on the facies relationships and their fossils. Crustaceans and vertebrates are presented at both the Tatuí and Taquaral beds. Different facies were recognized at Ponte Nova Farm. based on lithosomes. fossils and their relationships. In this context. a complex six facies architecture displayed at this locality allowed the formulation of a paleoenvironment hypothesis for the generation of the Tatuí Formation.

The first experiment evaluated the macroscopic alteration of cooked and fresh carcasses buried through the dry and rainy seasons. The second experiment analyzed the mycobiota associated to the decomposition of a complete bird that remained buried for almost a year. Results show that in tropical forest environments: 1) bone structure and pre-taphonomic factors determine its differential alteration by biochemical processes; 2) fungal populations associated to the decomposition of animal remains depend on soil chemistry and ecological dynamics; 3) even in a corrosive environment. bird bones are more capable of surviving to several mycological decomposition steps.,True,KxrOxm0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,11,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311003918,4390535804497642293,/scholar?cites=4390535804497642293,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31476322/Forancelli_et_al_(2012).pdf,0,0,0

They develop complex polypoid colonies and exhibit considerable morphological variation among species with respect to growth. defensive structures and mode of development. For instance. several lineages within this order have lost the medusa stage. Depending on the author. traditional taxonomy in hydrozoans may be either polyp-or medusa-oriented.

However. the evolutionary rate of Ceriantharia. one of the most enigmatic “orders” within Anthozoa. has never been specifically examined. In this study. the divergence of mitochondrial DNA of Ceriantharia was compared to members of other Anthozoa and Medusozoa groups. In addition. nuclear markers were used to check the relative phylogenetic position of Ceriantharia in relation to other Cnidaria members. The results demonstrated a pattern of divergence of mitochondrial DNA completely different from those estimated for other anthozoans. and phylogenetic analyses indicate that Ceriantharia is not included within hexacorallians in most performed analyses. Thus. we propose that the Ceriantharia should be addressed as a separate clade.,True,YjpL_BgAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC,54,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086612,1805114465866297940,/scholar?cites=1805114465866297940,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086612,0,0,0

This is probably due to the low genetic variation found among the molecular markers (primarily mitochondrial) commonly used for Anthozoa. Ceriantharia is an anthozoan group that has not been tested for genetic divergence at the species level. Recently. all three Atlantic species described for the genus Isarachnanthus of Atlantic Ocean. were deemed synonyms based on morphological simmilarities of only one species: Isarachnanthus maderensis. Here. we aimed to verify whether genetic relationships (using COI. 16S. ITS1 and ITS2 molecular markers) confirmed morphological affinities among members of Isarachnanthus from different regions across the Atlantic Ocean. Results from four DNA markers were completely congruent and revealed that two different species exist in the Atlantic Ocean. The low identification success and substantial overlap between intra and interspecific COI distances render the Anthozoa unsuitable for DNA barcoding. which is not true for Ceriantharia. In addition. genetic divergence within and between Ceriantharia species is more similar to that found in Medusozoa (Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa) than Anthozoa and Porifera that have divergence rates similar to typical metazoans. The two genetic species could also be separated based on micromorphological characteristics of their cnidomes. Using a specimen of Isarachnanthus bandanensis from Pacific Ocean as an outgroup. it was possible to estimate the minimum date of divergence between the clades.

Population connectivity of certain species can be achieved by long-lived oceanic larvae that can reach great distances and disperse through large areas. A group of specimens with great larval dispersal may have a larger connectivity and. consequently. the ability to re-establish after disturbances in certain regions.

Brazil. including a checklist of Brazilian hydroids,1996,Alvaro E Migotto and Willem Vervoort,306,,,,Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum,Despite being one of the most common invertebrate groups of intertidal and sublittoral regions. hydroids are poorly known in Brazilian waters. Indeed. the coastline of eastern South America was considered by Cornelius (1992) to be one of the least studied regions on earth. with few data on the occurrence and distribution of hydroids (see Appendix for a checklist of hydroids from the Brazilian coast). The only comprehensive hydroid studies in Brazil were carried out by Dr Marta Vannucci. who published papers dealing mostly with the benthic forms (Vannucci Mendes. 1946; Vannucci. 1949. 1950. 1951a. b. 1954). and later. with planktonic forms (Vannucci. 1957. 1963). In the years following Vannucci's research there was an emphasis on the study of medusae (Moreira. 1973; Navas-Pereira. 1980). and a few papers on hydroids were published (Mayal. 1973. 1983; Narchi & Hebling. 1975; Moreira et al.. 1978. 1979; da Silveira & Migotto. 1984. 1991. 1992; Migotto & da Silveira. 1987; Pires et al.. 1992; Marques. 1993). The hydroid fauna of Sao Sebastiao. on the coast of Sao Paulo State. in particular was poorly known. Vannucci (1949. 1951a. 1954) recorded only 16 species of thecate hydroids from that area. Later on. Moreira et al.(1978. 1979). da Silveira & Migotto (1984. 1991). Migotto & da Silveira (1987) and Marques (1993) added 12 species to the list.The present paper is a survey of the hydroid fauna of the Sao Sebastiao region. excluding the Eudendriidae that were studied by Marques (1993).

A very significant part of the collection comprises material from localities along the Atlantic coast of southern Argentina. the Estrecho de Magellanes and Tierra del Fuego. an area of great zoogeographical interest and with a badly known though richly developed hydroid fauna.

The localities. with some exceptions. are widely spaced. ranging from the deep sea to a few metres depth.

A large number of additional microslides preparations had been made and a voluminous bundle of notes on the various species. the majority of which had been identified. had been accumulated.

1140838,Review of the family Halopterididae (Hydrozoa. Cnidaria),1997,Peter Schuchert and Willem Vervoort,,,,,Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum,Halopterididae are a widespread family of marine thecate hydroids occurring in all seas. Some are also frequently encountered in shallow waters and popular faunistic identification guides regularly contain some Halopterididae. However. this study was started after an attempt to identify some Mediterranean samples made it evident that many species are not properly identifiable and that revisions are needed. The literature also is scattered widely and in publications that are difficult to access for the average institute. This study thus emphasises aspects of species recognition and identification; the taxonomy at the generic level is treated superficially only. A revision of taxa above the level of species in Halopterididae can only be made after a thorough phylogenetic analysis has become available. Such a study will be presented in a separate publication because it must be embedded in a broader taxonomie framework including also the other plumulariids. An excellent historic review and synonymy of some of the generic names can be found in Calder (in press); Millard (1975) and Bouillon (1995) too provide many synonyms. Limitations of resources and availability of material did not allow to describe and figure all species of the family. Therefore. emphasis was placed on the more important genera Antennella and Halopteris. The distributional range of the species is also discussed briefly as re-examination of material used by other authors showed an alarmingly high number of cases in which the material was incorrectly identified.

Copepoda). including the description of some old and new species,1962,W Vervoolt,56,,1,1-111,,During a recent survey of Pacific psammophilous and phycophilous copepods an isolated female Bomolochus was found. the identification of which. in absence of its host. proved to be particularly troublesome. It became necessary to check the descriptions of all species of the genus Bomolochus Von Nordmann. 1832. and of several other genera of Bomolochidae. in the course of which I tried to find a satisfactory grouping of the many species described. This effort in so far proved to be disappointing that a fairly large number of species is so inadequately characterized that recognition. in absence of the host. is next to impossible. Taxonomy of parasitic copepods has. unfortunately. long been influenced by the obstinate notion that each host species should necessarily harbour its own parasitic species. This idea has overstressed the importance of the host. at the cost of information. particularly morphological information. concerning the parasitic animal. so that at present there is an overwhelming number of parasitic copepods of uncertain position. uncertain status or inadequate definition. impeding a much wanted natural grouping of the numerous species of parasitic Copepoda. The importance of complete structural information. especially for those species that are able to leave their host temporarily. cannot be too greatly stressed and it is gratifying to find such information in many of the modern publications (Stock. 1953. 1955; Shen. 1957; Shiino. 1957; Yamaguti. 1936. 1939. 1953. et al.).

Detecting in situ ingestion of microfibres by small marine organisms is necessary to understand their potential accumulation in marine food webs and their role in marine pollution. We have examined the gut contents of meiofauna from six sandy beaches in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. Out of twenty taxonomic groups. three species of the common sandy beach annelid Saccocirrus displayed in situ ingestion of microfibres in all sites. Laboratory observations showed that species of Saccocirrus are able to egest microfibres with no obvious physical injury. We suggest that their non-selective microphagous suspension-feeding behaviour makes Saccocirrus more prone to ingest microfibres. Although microfibres are rapidly egested with no apparent harm. there is still the potential for trophic transfer into marine food webs …,True,9XxzIUwAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC,47,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116305036,10798914252114624927,/scholar?cites=10798914252114624927,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maikon_Di_Domenico/publication/304195948_In_situ_ingestion_of_microfibres_by_meiofauna_from_sandy_beaches/links/5769faf408ae7d2478cd8bee.pdf,0,0,0

A sharp decrease in population density was observed in spring 1996. The population density was probably affected by high temperatures and desiccation caused by the extremely low diurnal tides which occurred during that period. Growth was analyzed using computer based methods of length-frequency data (Elefan). which estimates growth parameters of the Von Bertalanffy formula (VBGF).

Here we quantify temporal variation in recruit richness. composition and structure of a rich cnidarian assemblage in southeastern Brazil. and evaluate the effect of microhabitat type and time of submersion on these patterns.

Temporal turnover of species is an equally important component of species diversity. which can by itself account for diversity patterns. but has received much less attention. especially in marine communities.

In this study. the divergence of mitochondrial DNA of Ceriantharia was compared to members of other Anthozoa and Medusozoa groups. In addition. nuclear markers were used to check the relative phylogenetic position of Ceriantharia in relation to other Cnidaria members. The results demonstrated a pattern of divergence of mitochondrial DNA completely different from those estimated for other anthozoans. and phylogenetic analyses indicate that Ceriantharia is not included within hexacorallians in most performed analyses.

This is probably due to the low genetic variation found among the molecular markers (primarily mitochondrial) commonly used for Anthozoa. Ceriantharia is an anthozoan group that has not been tested for genetic divergence at the species level. Recently. all three Atlantic species described for the genus Isarachnanthus of Atlantic Ocean. were deemed synonyms based on morphological simmilarities of only one species: Isarachnanthus maderensis. Here. we aimed to verify whether genetic relationships (using COI. 16S. ITS1 and ITS2 molecular markers) confirmed morphological affinities among members of Isarachnanthus from different regions across the Atlantic Ocean. Results from four DNA markers were completely congruent and revealed that two different species exist in the Atlantic Ocean. The low identification success and substantial overlap between intra and interspecific COI distances render the Anthozoa unsuitable for DNA barcoding. which is not true for Ceriantharia. In addition. genetic divergence within and between Ceriantharia species is more similar to that found in Medusozoa (Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa) than Anthozoa and Porifera that have divergence rates similar to typical metazoans. The two genetic species could also be separated based on micromorphological characteristics of their cnidomes. Using a specimen of Isarachnanthus bandanensis from Pacific Ocean as an outgroup. it was possible to estimate the minimum date of divergence between the clades.

The main labor divisions are between feeding. reproduction and defense. In H. symbiolongicarpus. the feeding polyp (called a gastrozooid) has elongated tentacles and a mouth. which are absent in the reproductive polyp (gonozooid) and defensive polyp (dactylozooid). Instead. the dactylozooid has an extended body column with an abundance of stinging cells (nematocysts) and the gonozooid bears gonophores on its body column. Morphological differences between polyp types can be attributed to simple changes in their axial patterning during development. and it has long been hypothesized that these specialized polyps arose through evolutionary alterations in oral-aboral patterning of the ancestral gastrozooid. An assembly of 66.508 transcripts (>200 bp) were generated using short-read Illumina RNA-Seq libraries constructed from feeding. reproductive. and defensive polyps of H. symbiolongicarpus. Using several different annotation methods. approximately 54% of the transcripts were annotated. Differential expression analyses were conducted between these three polyp types to isolate genes that may be involved in functional. histological. and pattering differences between polyp types. Nearly 7 K transcripts were differentially expressed in a polyp-specific manner. including members of the homeodomain. myosin. toxin and BMP gene families.

In many animal systems. the asymmetries that drive the dynamics and outcome of male—male contests are related to resource holding potential (RHP) or territory ownership.

To this end. we introduce a novel non-contact method to characterize the surface waves produced in the skin under a variety of stimulation conditions. Specifically. we deliver vibrations to the fingertip using a vibratory actuator and measure. using a laser Doppler vibrometer. the surface waves at different distances from the locus of stimulation. First. we show that a vibration applied to the fingertip travels at least the length of the finger and that the rate at which it decays is dependent on stimulus frequency. Furthermore. the resonant frequency of the skin matches the frequency at which a subpopulation of afferents. namely Pacinian afferents. is most sensitive. We show that this skin resonance can lead to a two-fold increase in the strength of the response of a simulated afferent population. Second. the rate at which vibrations propagate across the skin is dependent on the stimulus frequency and plateaus at 7 m/s. The resulting delay in neural activation across locations does not substantially blur the temporal patterning in simulated populations of afferents for frequencies less than 200 Hz. which has important implications about how vibratory frequency is encoded in the responses of somatosensory neurons. Third. we show that. despite the dependence of decay rate and propagation speed on frequency. the waveform of a complex vibration is well preserved as it travels across the skin.

In the wolf spider Schizocosa stridulans. despite evidence of strong female choice. prior research has been unable to link the conspicuous sexually dimorphic foreleg ornamentation of males to their mating success. We conducted three experiments aimed at determining the function of this previously enigmatic ornamentation. Our first two experiments used males with phenotypically modified foreleg phenotypes in simple and complex mating environments in order to examine the relationship between the presence/absence of ornamentation and male mating success. In both experiments. we found no relationship: courtship rate was the sole predictor of mating success.

In the wolf spider Rabidosa punctulata. males display 2 distinct mating tactics: 1) “courtship”—consisting of visual and seismic components or 2) “direct mount”—consisting of males grappling/holding females until they assume a copulatory posture. We tested for condition-dependent tactic expression using both field-collected individuals (representing natural variation in body mass and condition) and individuals whose diet we manipulated in the laboratory (representing extreme divergences in body size and condition).

Male Rabidosa rabida wolf spiders use courtship displays that couple a seismic signal with the waving of an ornamented foreleg. While previous studies suggest that female R. rabida exhibit mate choice and that both the seismic and visual modalities are important in mating interactions. it remains unclear how variation in each component influences female mating decisions. To investigate this. we ran two separate experiments in which we manipulated (1) male diets. to induce variation in the seismic courtship signal. and (2) male foreleg color. to artificially induce variation in visual foreleg ornamentation.

Signaling costs can arise via a variety of avenues. including energy expenditure. predator attraction. and so on (reviews in Zuk and Kolluru. 1998; Kotiaho. 2001). and are predicted to increase with signal expression (eg. size. amplitude. and intensity; Johnstone. 1997). Due to these costs. signaler condition. which is hypothesized to be a reflection of a signaler’s genetic quality. is expected to influence the level of signal expression one can afford (Zahavi. 1975). resulting in a positive correlation between signaler condition and signal expression–that is. condition-dependent signaling (Zahavi. 1977; West-Eberhard. 1979; Andersson. 1982; Nur and Hasson. 1984; Zeh and Zeh. 1988; von Schantz et al.. 1999).Despite the wealth of theoretical and empirical work on condition-dependent signaling. the term condition itself is somewhat enigmatic.

In particular. males of many species attempt to reduce competition with males in the surrounding environment by altering their mating behaviors.

In natural environments. these spiders are relatively dense. Competing males are often close by and could potentially intercept courtship displays. locate the nearby female and steal the copulation.

We examined the reproductive patterns of a monogamous population of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui). and attempted to identify sources of within‐season fitness variation among females and known‐age males. Many males did not acquire a nest site. and many territorial males were unsuccessful in acquiring a mate. The likelihood that territorial males mated depended on several aspects of nest sites. Mated males of age three were larger than the average size of age‐three males in the population. The mean sizes of age‐four and age‐five mated males were not different from the average of same‐age males in the population. Thus. selection resulting from the acquisition of a mate favored large size among only age‐three males.

Males that spawned at 3 yr of age obtained on average many more eggs than males that delayed reproduction. suggesting that age at reproduction is a conditional strategy. Body size appears to be the trait used to determine the value of the life history decision; small age‐3 males were more likely to delay reproduction than large males. The tactic adopted by males may also depend on events that occur well before the time of the life history decision. as males of a cohort that were large at age 3 were also large at age 1.

We generalize the sequential search rule and examine how the shape of the function that relates a male character to the benefit of a mating decision influences the threshold value of the male trait that induces females to terminate search. If the fitness function is linear the optimal threshold value of a male character increases with the slope of the function. The phenotypic threshold criterion declines. all else being equal. if the fitness function is made more concave (or less convex) by an increase of the risk of the function.

Using statistical methodology that allows discrimination between assessment types. we examined contests in the jumping spider Phidippus clarus.

Phidippus clarus are jumping spiders in which males produce multimodal (visual and vibrational) signals in both male–male (aggressive) and male–female (courtship) contexts. The P. clarus mating system is complex. with sex ratios and the level of male competition changing over the course of the breeding season. Vibrational signal components have been shown to function in male aggressive contests but their role in courtship has not been investigated.

But is this enthusiasm warranted? The review by Gagliano (2012) in this issue highlights some of the considerable hurdles to demonstrating acoustic communication in plants. Part of the excitement of plant communication is that the behavioral ecology community has a new opportunity to employ a rigorous research approach rooted in Tinbergen’s ethological tradition (Tinbergen 1963). We propose that this approach needs to be identified clearly.

The emergence of assortative mating is believed to be critical to this process. but how assortative mating arises in diverging populations is poorly understood. The wolf spider genus Schizocosa has become a model system for studying mechanisms of assortative mating. We conducted a series of experiments to identify the factors that control mate pair formation in a Schizocosa population that includes both ornamented and nonornamented males. We show that the population also includes two previously unrecognized female phenotypes. One female phenotype mates mostly or exclusively with ornamented males. and the other mates mostly or exclusively with unornamented males.

While strong directional selection imposed by female choice should deplete variation in male secondary sexual traits. this variation persists. This dissertation examines the persistence of a male sexual-trait dimorphism. First. I examine if two male morphs are genetically distinct. Then. I test whether the more ornamented morph incurs greater costs associated with predation. and shows greater behavioral plasticity in response to the threat of predation. Male sexual-trait dimorphisms may persist in a single population unless drift or selection fixes one male morph in a population. Using mitochondrial sequence data and microsatellite data. I tested whether two male morphs are genetically distinct in a population in Mississippi that exhibits both male morphs. and in localities in the Ohio Valley where only one male morph exists per location. I found for all locations. that despite having distinct secondary sexual traits. the two male forms are genetically indistinguishable. The persistence of a male polymorphism requires equal fitness of the morphs. and implies a trade-off within each morph. Natural selection by predation has been proposed as a cost that balances sexual selection. I tested whether brush-legged males. thought to be favored by sexual selection. incur greater costs associated with predation than non-ornamented males. Measuring rates of predation in the field and timing of attacks and captures in the laboratory revealed equal predation on the two male forms.

However. mating interactions can proceed through a series of stages. with opportunities for assessment at each stage. We compared whether male or female size predicted mating interaction outcome across several stages of mating in five species of North American leiobunine harvestmen (commonly known as daddy longlegs). Leiobunine harvestmen have been previously shown to exhibit incredible morphological diversity consistent with a spectrum of male–female antagonism. Across all of the species. we found a general progression of female size predicting the outcome (success and timing) of early stages of interactions. and male size or male size relative to female size predicting the outcome and timing of later stages of interactions. We also found that size was not a strong predictor of outcome in the two species on the lower end of the antagonism spectrum. The variation in how female and male size predicted outcomes across species and stages of mating suggests that multiple mechanisms may operate to shape mating dynamics within and across species. Given the close relatedness of the species studied. the patterns we uncovered suggest a rapid evolution of the traits and processes predicting the outcome of mating interactions.

For example. sit-and-wait predators impose greater costs to males moving in search of mates.

Many reproductive behaviors are thermally-sensitive. but little is known how temperature affects the behaviors used to find mates and coordinate mating. Here. we investigate how temperature influences courtship activity in two sympatric species of Enchenopa treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae). Enchenopa use substrate-borne vibrational signals exchanged in male-female duets to facilitate pair formation prior to mating. In a controlled laboratory setting. we assessed the likelihood of males and females to produce courtship signals across a range of ecologically relevant temperatures. We found that changes in courtship activity across temperatures differed between the two species. We also found sex differences within species: in one species males were more likely to signal at higher temperatures. while in the other species females were more likely to signal at higher temperatures. Our results suggest that sex-specific responses to temperature may constrain mating to narrower ranges of temperatures.

This animal shows a remarkable ability to detect the direction of an incident sound stimulus even though its acoustic sensory organs are in very close proximity to each other. This close proximity causes the arrival times of the sound pressures at the two ears to be less than 1 to 2 μs depending on the direction of propagation of the sound wave. The small differences in these two pressures must be processed by the animal in order to determine the incident direction of the sound. In this fly. the ears are so close together that they are actually joined by a cuticular structure which couples their motion mechanically and subsequently magnifies interaural differences.

Gryllus bimaculatus. and how behavioural context influences its expression,1995,Shelley A Adamo and Ronald R Hoy,49,Animal Behaviour,6,1491-1501,Academic Press,Previous interactions with conspecifics influenced the pattern. frequency and intensity of agonistic behaviour in the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. Tactile contact appeared to be the most important sensory cue responsible for the observed shifts in behaviour. Contact with other adult males promoted the production of aggressive song both during and after fights between males. However. individually housed males and males with restricted contact with conspecifics (once per day for 5 days) produced their aggressive song only at the end of an agonistic encounter. These two patterns of agonistic behaviour may reflect alternate fighting strategies. Prior experience influences whether sensory cues from a conspecific will initate agonistic behaviour. After males lost a fight. they displayed no further agonistic behaviour for 10 min but then gradually recovered their agonistic behaviour within an hour.

1141092,Hybrid cricket auditory behavior: evidence for genetic coupling in animal communication,1977,Ronald R Hoy and Janet Hahn and Robert C Paul,195,Science,4273,82-84,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Male field crickets produce species-specific and stereotyped calling songs. Conspecific females are attracted to the call. Reciprocal F1 hybrid females prefer the calls of sibling hybrids to reciprocal hybrids. Discrimination is probably based on temporal pattern and not carrier frequency of the call. The results imply that production of song by males and its detection by females have a common genetic basis.,True,oBmqfO0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,185,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/195/4273/82.abstract,15163981481513372262,/scholar?cites=15163981481513372262,,,0,0,0
1141093,Genetic control of song specificity in crickets,1973,Ronald R Hoy and Robert C Paul,180,Science,4081,82-83,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The calling song of male field crickets is composed of stereotyped rhythmic pulse intervals. which are predictable expressions of genotype. Females identify conspecific males by their song. Two species of crickets were found to exhibit species-specific song preference. and hybrids between them preferred hybrid calls over either parental call. These results imply genetic control of song reception as well as transmission.,True,oBmqfO0AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,174,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/180/4081/82.abstract,15527114214757119121,/scholar?cites=15527114214757119121,,,0,0,0
1141094,Postembryonic development of adult motor patterns in crickets: a neural analysis,1970,David R Bentley and Ronald R Hoy,170,Science,3965,1409-1411,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Adult crickets have stereotyped patterns of motor output which are generated by the central nervous system. and which serve as a standard against which emerging nymphal patterns can be measured. The neural circuits generating these patterns are not functional at hatching. The pattern elements appear in an ordered sequence over the course of the last four molts. The circuits are completely functional before the final molt. Circuits which might be prematurely activated are suppressed in the nymph by descending inhibition from the brain.,True,oBmqfO0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,158,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/170/3965/1409.abstract,9567620492820393617,/scholar?cites=9567620492820393617,,,0,0,0
1141095,Directional hearing by mechanical coupling in the parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea,1996,D Robert and RN Miles and RR Hoy,179,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,1,29-44,Springer-Verlag,Sound localization is a basic processing task of the auditory system. The directional detection of an incident sound impinging on the ears relies on two acoustic cues: interaural amplitude and interaural time differences. In small animals. with short interaural distances both amplitude and time cues can become very small. challenging the directional sensitivity of the auditory system. The ears of a parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea. are unusual in that both acoustic sensors are separated by only 520 μm and are contained within an undivided air-filled chamber. This anatomy results in minuscule differences in interaural time cues (ca. 2 μs) and no measurable difference in interaural intensity cues generated from an incident sound wave.The tympana of both ears are anatomically coupled by a cuticular bridge. This bridge also mechanically couples the tympanana. providing a basis for directional sensitivity …,True,oBmqfO0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,147,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00193432.pdf,8744604208555553158,/scholar?cites=8744604208555553158,,http://homer2.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/hearing17/robert/pdf1/RobertJCompPhys1996.pdf,0,0,0
1141096,The neurobiology of cricket song,1974,David Bentley and Ronald R Hoy,231,Scientific American,2,34-45,Scientific American. a division of Nature America. Inc.,Nowadays few people live where they can hear crickets singing on summer evenings. but makers of motion pictures know that nothing evokes a bucolic mood more effectively than the sound of crickets chirping in the background. Cricket song. which may seem like a random sequence of chirps and trills. is actually a communication system of considerable complexity. As Richard D. Alexander of the University of Michigan and others have shown. each species of cricket has a distinctive repertory of several songs that have evolved to transmit messages of behav ioral importance.From the work of many laboratories. including our own at the University of California at Berkeley and at Cornell University. it is known that the nerve networks needed for generating the songs of crickets are closely allied to those involved in flight. Both systems de velop in stages as the cricket passes through its growth cycle from the larva to the …,True,oBmqfO0AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,147,https://www.jstor.org/stable/24950141,15395262969491353131,/scholar?cites=15395262969491353131,,https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/bionb4240/Reprints/Bentley%20and%20Hoy%20scientificamerican0874-34.pdf,0,0,0
1141097,Temporal pattern as a cue for species-specific calling song recognition in crickets,1979,Gerald S Pollack and Ronald R Hoy,204,Science,4391,429-432,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Female crickets can recognize conspecific calling song from its temporal pattern alone. In Teleogryllus oceanicus. the song pattern consists of three classes of interpulse intervals arranged in a stereotyped sequence. Females recognize a model song in which the sequential order of intervals is random. This argues against the hypothesis that recognition results from matching auditory input to an internal template of the song.,True,oBmqfO0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,144,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/204/4391/429.abstract,9042066842706453582,/scholar?cites=9042066842706453582,,http://www.biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/pollack/pdfs/pollack_hoy_science79.pdf,0,0,0
1141098,Temperature coupling in cricket acoustic communication,1992,Anthony Pires and Ronald R Hoy,171,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,1,79-92,Springer-Verlag,Acoustic communication in Gryllus firmus is temperature-coupled: temperature induces parallel changes in male calling song temporal pattern. and in female preference for song. Temperature effects on song production and recognition networks were localized by selectively warming head or thorax or both head and thorax of intact crickets. then eliciting aggression song production (males) or phonotaxis to synthetic calling song (females). Because male song is produced by a thoracic central pattern generator (CPG). and because head ganglia are necessary for female song recognition. measurements of female phonotaxis under such conditions may be used to test the following competing hypotheses about organization of the song recognition network: 1. A set of neurons homologous to the male song CPG exist in the female. and are used as a template that determines preferred values of song temporal …,True,oBmqfO0AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,139,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00195963,8084684346501073731,/scholar?cites=8084684346501073731,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42913380/Temperature_coupling_in_cricket_acoustic20160221-31975-vi5nr2.pdf,0,0,0
