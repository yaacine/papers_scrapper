1278664,Model-based control of HCCI engines using exhaust recompression,2009,Nikhil Ravi and Matthew J Roelle and Hsien-Hsin Liao and Adam F Jungkunz and Chen-Fang Chang and Sungbae Park and J Christian Gerdes,18,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,6,1289-1302,IEEE,Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is one of the most promising piston-engine concepts for the future. providing significantly improved efficiency and emissions characteristics relative to current technologies. This paper presents a framework for controlling an HCCI engine with exhaust recompression and direct injection of fuel into the cylinder. A physical model is used to describe the HCCI process. with the model states being closely linked to the thermodynamic state of the cylinder constituents. Separability between the effects of the control inputs on the desired outputs provides an opportunity to develop a simple linear control scheme. where the fuel is used to control the work output and the valve timings are used to control the phasing of combustion. The controller is tested on both a single and multi-cylinder HCCI engine. demonstrating the value of a physical model-based control approach that …,True,am6Ec0wAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,84,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5356220/,182880984900801088,/scholar?cites=182880984900801088,,,,0,0,0
1278665,A physics-based approach to the control of homogeneous charge compression ignition engines with variable valve actuation,2005,GM Shaver and MJ Roelle and PA Caton and NB Kaahaaina and N Ravi and JP Hathout and J Ahmed and A Kojic and S Park and CF Edwards and JC Gerdes,6,International Journal of Engine Research,4,361-375,SAGE Publications,Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is a promising low-temperature combustion strategy for reducing NOx emissions and increasing efficiency in internal combustion engines. However. HCCI has no direct combustion initiator and. when achieved by reinducting or trapping residual exhaust gas with a variable valve actuation (VVA) system. becomes a dynamic process as the temperature of the residual gas couples one cycle to the next. These characteristics of residual-affected HCCI present a challenge for control engineers and a barrier to implementing HCCI in a production engine. In order to address these challenges. this paper outlines physics-based control strategies for both the VVA system and the HCCI combustion process. The results show that VVA system control can provide arbitrary valve timings on a cycle-to-cycle basis. enabling tight control of HCCI.

For a propane–air mixture. the lean blowout limit is associated with strong pressure fluctuation arising simultaneously with strong flame–vortex interactions. which have been shown to constitute the mechanism of heat release dynamics in this flow. A high-speed air jet. issuing from a small slot and injected perpendicular to the main flow near the step. is used to disrupt this mechanism. For momentum ratio of jet to main flow below unity. the jet dilutes the mixture. further destabilizing the flame or leading to complete blowout. Above unity. the flame becomes more stable. and the pressure oscillations are suppressed. Flow visualization and OH*/CH* chemiluminescence measurements show that a strong jet produces a more compact flame that is less driven by the wake vortex. anchored closer to the step. and deflected upwards …,True,am6Ec0wAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,67,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0082078404002279,1667266534265665747,/scholar?cites=1667266534265665747,,,,0,0,0

The efficacy of the controller was tested with two different nozzle configurations. The first consisted of a dual-feed nozzle whose primary fuel stream was utilized to sustain combustion. while the secondarystreamwasused for active control. The second configuration used a single-feed nozzle with two different swirling air streams. An LQG-LTR (linear quadratic Gaussian-loop transfer recovery) controller was designed using the SI-based model to determine the active control input. which was in turn used to modulate the secondary fuel stream.

In these cases. the acoustic field acts as the resonator. while the heat-release dynamics. induced due to the impact of pressure or flow velocity perturbations on the equivalence ratio. flame length. residence time. shear layer. etc.. supplies energy to support pressure oscillations. In this paper. we discuss another mechanism in which the resonator may not be the acoustic field: instead. it is an absolutely unstable shear layer mode acting as the source of sustained oscillations; which morph as large-scale eddies at a frequency different from acoustic modes. These perturb the flame motion and provide energy to the acoustic field. acting here as an amplifier to support pressure oscillations.

Previous planar flame models have been successfully extended to account for the conical flame surfaces formed downstream of the burner plate holes. The coupled effects of the heat loss to the burner plate and the flame kinematics have been modeled. The resonant peaks are determined by the burning velocity oscillations of the flame which arise as a result of the heat loss mechanism. Flame area oscillations become significant above the resonant frequency. introducing heat release rate oscillations and reducing the lag between the net heat release rate and the inlet velocity.

We are able to predict the phase between the mass flow rate oscillations and the resulting heat release fluctuations. as function of the operating conditions. for example. the mean equivalence ratio and mass flow rate. The model predicts a 180° sudden shift in phase between imposed flow oscillations and resulting heat release between the maximum reaction rate and the blow-out limit.

However. the HCCI process is sensitive to disturbances that can cause the engine to misfire. especially at low loads. In this paper. we propose an efficient. physics-based model for studying engine state evolution in the presence of misfires. The model relies on a simple recursive mass balance model. simplified thermodynamic mechanisms. and use of the ¿integrated Arrhenius rate¿ with a modified threshold to model combustion phasing. occurrence of misfire. and partial burn during misfire. Simulation results for our reduced-order model. compared to a high-resolution HCCI simulation proposed in a previous work. show good match.,True,am6Ec0wAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,13,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5400597/,1110611443909596289,/scholar?cites=1110611443909596289,,,,0,0,0

1278685,Characterization and control of vortex dynamics in an unstable dump combustor,2004,Bin Pang and Kenneth Yu and Sungbae Park and Adam Wachsman and Anuradha Annaswamy and Ahmed Ghoniem,,,,1162,,Active combustion control experiments were performed in a dump combustor using pulsed liquid-fuel injection. Various control strategies were applied and the resulting combustor flow fields were characterized using high-speed schlieren photography and particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). Both qualitative and quantitative results were obtained and compared to identify important physical processes that may have affected active control effectiveness. The schlieren results clearly support the idea that large vortex shedding at the dump plane plays the central role in self-sustained combustion instabilities. Because of the potential coupling with heat release. it is not just sufficient to disrupt its periodicity but vortex shedding must be suppressed when applying active control. Properly applied active control case revealed that large vortex shedding was totally suppressed along with pressure oscillations.

In this paper. we evaluate its performance in the context of a 4 MW combustor test-rig model that mimics many of the dynamic characteristics of an actual engine including a significant time-delay.

This combustion instability often occurs near blow limit and high thermal out conditions and generates large amplitudes of heat release and pressure oscillations. Active control has been used to suppress combustion instability. but due to complex dynamics of the combustion processes. modeling of the combustion system has often been limited the application of the active control.

Fly ash may be used in water treatment to remove mercury (Hg2+) from water or to immobilize mercury mobile forms in silts and soils. Experiments were carried out on two kinds of fly ashes produced by two circulating fluidized bed plants with different chemical composition: silico-aluminous fly ashes and sulfo-calcic fly ashes. For the two kinds of fly ashes. adsorption equilibrium were reached in 3 days. Furthermore. removal of mercury was increased with increasing pH. Sulfo-calcic fly ashes allow us to remove mercury more efficiently and more steady. The chemical analysis of fly ash surface was carried out by electron spectroscopy. The results show that mercury is bound to ash surface thanks to several chemical reactions between mercury and various oxides (silicon. aluminium and calcium silicate) of the surface of the ashes.,True,fQie_Q8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,106,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236102002375,2592591994037977369,/scholar?cites=2592591994037977369,,,,0,0,0

L-valve is a common non-mechanical valve used to control solid flow rate pneumatically. Gas flow around the elbow of an L-valve together with particles properties determines the amount of solids transported through the L-valve of known geometry.The L-valve operation in an interconnected fluidized bed system is presented in this work.

1278701,Fluidization and mixing of solids distributed in size and density,1994,Arnaud B Delebarre and Albert Pavinato and Joel C Leroy,80,Powder technology,3,227-233,Elsevier,This article presents a study of the fluidization of solids dispersed in size and density simultaneously. Minimum and complete fluidization velocities of these solids are measured and compared with their Umf distribution. Extensions of some correlations established for binary mixtures are also proposed. The axial mixing state of the beds near these two velocities is then evaluated by sampling. and expressed in terms of several indices: size index. density index and the combined Umf index. In contrast with Umf. the axial profile of the bed is mainly controlled by the density distribution of the materials. An index based on the pressure drop along the bed height gives an on-line indication of that segregation.,True,fQie_Q8AAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591094800073,18180143533507505504,/scholar?cites=18180143533507505504,,,,0,0,0

The model hydrodynamics is based on the two phase bubble - emulsion concept of bubbling fluidized beds. validated by residence time distribution tests conducted in a 10 kWth equivalent cold flow prototype. The model kinetics is based on the literature and adjusted based on experimental results from a 10 kWth CLC pilot plant. Results show the necessity of including both non-direct catalytic and non-catalytic direct reaction of gases on the oxygen carriers. The model shows good agreement with experimental results if some kinetic and hydrodynamic modifications are considered. including impact of gas adsorption by falling particles in the bubble phase on the gas exchange coefficient and thermodynamic limitation of CO and H2 combustion.,True,fQie_Q8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,26,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261913005618,4624871901277180182,/scholar?cites=4624871901277180182,,,,0,0,0

One of the principal functions of loop-seal is to avoid the undesirable inverse gas flow and to provide gas tightness. Formation of a moving solid bed in the supply chamber of the loop-seal provides the primary functions of the loop-seal in terms of pressure drop balance and gas leakage minimization.Loop-seal operation in an interconnected fluidized bed system is presented in this work. Ilmenite and two sand particles are used with corresponding density of 4750 kg/m3 and 2650 kg/m3 and average diameters ranging from 128 to 368 μm. The pressure drop variations in different elements of the loop-seal are analyzed as function of gas and solid flow rate and pressure balance across the solid circulation loop.

Metal oxide plays the role of an oxygen carrier by providing oxygen for combustion when being reduced and is then re-oxidized by air in a separate reactor. Combustion is thus without any direct contact between air and fuel: as a consequence flue gas does not contain nitrogen of air which simplifies flue gas treatment prior to sequestration. In the present study. biogas combustion was analyzed in a chemical looping combustion fluidized bed reactor. NiAl0.44O1.67 and Cu0.95Fe1.05AlO4 metal oxide particles were used as oxygen carriers. The experiments have shown the feasibility of biogas combustion in chemical looping combustion: CH4 of the biogas was completely converted to CO2 and H2O with a small fraction of CO and H2.

Solids hold-up and pressure drop have been measured for various gas and solids flow rates. The main results are the following. (i) Transitions between regimes can be observed by means of diagrams already valid for free fluidization; a transport velocity and a critical velocity can be evaluated from them. (ii) The concentration of powder in the following suspension is strictly proportional to the powder flow rate at a fixed gas velocity. An average velocity of the solids can then be calculated; this velocity is a linear function of the gas velocity.

1278711,Does the minimum fluidization exist?,2002,Arnaud Delebarre,124,J. Fluids Eng.,3,595-600,,This work proposes an equation giving the pressure drop of a gas flowing through a porous medium or a granular bed. The consequences for the onset of the fluidization are then discussed. It appears that the notion of minimum gas mass-flow rate would improve the description of the transition between fixed and fluidized bed regimes. An equation is then proposed to calculate the minimum fluidization gas mass-flow rate. It is then proved that the minimum fluidization is not only a function of the medium and fluid characteristics but also that it increases with bed inventory. It is then shown that a batch of particles has a minimum fluidization depending on its arrangement in a column and that in some cases. this minimum does not exist at all. As a consequence. the minimum of fluidization. whether it is a velocity or a mass flow rate. cannot be considered as a criterion to characterize a powder. ,True,fQie_Q8AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,15,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/fluidsengineering/article-abstract/124/3/595/444317,4560594018177063220,/scholar?cites=4560594018177063220,,,,0,0,0

1278737,One-Pot Synthesis of Block Copolymers Containing a Polyolefin Block,2018,Tianwei Yan and Dylan J Walsh and Chengling Qiu and Damien Guironnet,51,Macromolecules,24,10167-10173,American Chemical Society,Polyolefin-containing block copolymers were catalytically synthesized using a postpolymerization modification strategy. A traditional olefin polymerization followed by a tandem hydroformylation/hydrogenation of the olefinic terminated polymer was implemented to yield a hydroxyl terminated polyolefin. The hydroxyl terminated polyolefin was then used as a macroinitiator for the ring-opening polymerization of cyclic esters to yield the corresponding diblock copolymer. This methodology was applied to an array of different polyolefins and two cyclic monomers (ε-caprolactone and lactide) showcasing the versatility of the protocol. Most noticeably. isotactic polypropylene was quantitatively incorporated into block copolymers. Additionally. the hydrophobicity of polyethylene films was successfully decreased by the addition of small amounts of a block copolymer.,True,GLiR5LkAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,8,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b02475,12869748180264953356,/scholar?cites=12869748180264953356,,,,0,0,0

1278738,Introduction of highly tunable end-groups in polyethylene via chain-transfer polymerization using a cobalt (III) catalyst,2019,Michael G Hyatt and Damien Guironnet,38,Organometallics,4,788-796,American Chemical Society,Highly tunable end-functionalized polyethylene molecules are directly synthesized via chain-transfer polymerization of ethylene with silanes as chain-transfer agents catalyzed by a pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl cobalt phosphite alkyl catalyst. A series of polymerizations and kinetic studies of the different elementary steps involved in the catalytic cycle were performed to establish the methodology and to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism. The rate of the chain transfer. and thus the polymer length. can be tuned independently by varying the silane concentration or substituents. The combination of a chain-transfer methodology with a late transition-metal-based catalyst makes this system more compatible to polar functionality. This is highlighted by the introduction of an organic dye as end group to yield a colored polyethylene material.,True,GLiR5LkAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,7,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.organomet.8b00765,13004088741755103310,/scholar?cites=13004088741755103310,,,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10105025,0,0,0

One possible solution for this issue is the implementation of desalination but its utilization can greatly increase the demand for electricity. An important concept for a wide scale implementation of desalination is the integration of water and energy resources.Jordan is currently one of the most water deprived countries in the world. It is also a country very rich in renewable energy sources but almost no utilization of that potential. A combination of desalination. pump storage that utilize the produced brine and renewable energy sources could solve both issues.

Precise control of the voltage applied to the coils is required to avoid high contact velocities during valve closing and opening. ie. to ensure soft landing. In our previous work we designed a tracking controller that consists of a constant preset voltage augmented by a voltage command based on a linear feedback and modified by an Iterative Learning Controller (ILC). The new results reported here involve the preset voltage in the learning process. This yields good results in the presence of unknown gas flow forces through the valves.

The nominal output of the present sensor is the increase in wire temperature and this output is a function of the time constant of the heated wire and thus also of the velocity of flow. At very low flow velocities. the response is determined almost entirely by the time constant of the wire while at high velocities the device acts almost like a constant current hot-wire anemometer. The present thermal flow sensor. which can be used over a large range of velocities. is well suited for measurements of steady or slowly varying unsteady flows in industrial applications.

1278755,Design of a single-axis tracking parabolic collector for moderate temperature applications,2004,S Odeh and S Nijmeh and M Sami Ashhab and Y Zakaria and A Amra,,,,,,Parabolic-trough solar water heating is a well proven solar energy technology which is being used on a commercial scale to produce heat for industrial and residential applications. In this work. a single tracking axis parabolic trough collector was designed and constructed for moderate heat load processes. The solar tracking collector was designed to be a self powered system so it can operate remotely and independently under moderate radiation levels. Simplicity in manufacturing and operation was considered in the design of this collector such as using stainless steel as a reflecting surface and a closed loop control system for the single solar tracking axis.

1278756,Modelling of a novel hot-wire thermal flow sensor with neural nets under different operating conditions,2006,Ahmed Al-Salaymeh,126,Sensors and Actuators A: Physical,1,7-14,Elsevier,Thermal flow sensors with a wide dynamic range are widely applied in practical fluid flow measurements to yield local velocity information and also for volume flow-rate measurements. The importance of such flow sensors inspired the authors’ investigations into wide-velocity range thermal sensors and the outcome of this work is summarized in this paper. The present novel sensor is mechanically the same as the hot-wire anemometer. but it is excited by discrete. widely separated. square waves of electrical current rather than a continuous current. The nominal output of the new sensor is a function of the time constant of the heated wire and thus also of the velocity of flow. The time constant decreases as the flow velocity increases. while the heat transfer increases. In this paper. the results obtained suggest that our measurements for flow velocity and volume flow rate are in very good agreement with the theoretical …,True,3jZi0IgAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,16,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424705005364,6908956753539247466,/scholar?cites=6908956753539247466,,,,0,0,0

1278766,Thermal photovoltaic solar integrated system analysis using neural networks,2007,S Ashhab,,,,,,The energy demand in Jordan is primarily met by petroleum products. As such. the development of renewable energy systems is quite attractive. In particular. solar energy is a promising renewable energy source in Jordan and has been used for food canning. paper production. air-conditioning and sterilization. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have received significant attention due to their capabilities in forecasting. modelling of complex nonlinear systems and control. ANNs have been used for forecasting solar energy. This paper presented a study that examined a thermal photovoltaic solar integrated system that was built in Jordan. Historical input-output system data that was collected experimentally was used to train an ANN that predicted the collector. PV module. pump and total efficiencies. The model predicted the efficiencies well and can therefore be utilized to find the operating conditions of the system that will produce the maximum system efficiencies. The paper provided a description of the photovoltaic solar system including equations for PV module efficiency; pump efficiency; and total efficiency. The paper also presented data relevant to the system performance and neural networks. The results of a neural net model were also presented based on the thermal PV solar integrated system data that was collected.

One of the popular acceleration algorithms that achieve this objective is the Depth First Search computation in a large and dense graph. The algorithm is enhanced in this research by utilizing the hMetis partitioning which is a hyper graph partitioning algorithm that divides a massive graph into sub-graphs or fragments each containing nodes. The enhanced technique is called the DFS_h algorithm. One of the features of the DFS_h algorithm is that it starts randomly from any node in any fragment and it processes the other fragments piece by piece based on the border nodes and edges.

A study was conducted to evaluate their potential for being converted into higher value activated carbons by a low-cost process. Six chars derived from various lignocellulosic precursors were activated in CO 2 at 800 C to 30–35% weight loss. and their surface area and porosity were characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. It was found that. in similar activation conditions. the surface area of the activated carbons correlates with the activation energy of the oxidation reaction by CO 2. which in turn varies inversely with the carbon yield after thermolysis in nitrogen at 1000 C. Since lignin is the most thermally-stable component of lignocellulosic biomass. these results demonstrate. indirectly. that robust. lignin-rich vegetal precursors are to be preferred to produce higher quality activated carbons. The chars derived from white pine (pinus strobus) and chestnut oak (quercus prinus) were converted to activated carbons with the highest surface area (900–1100 m 2/g) and largest mesopores volume (0.85–1.06 cm 3/g).

Recycling this hazardous waste to produce useful products is paramount towards sustainability that has a direct impact on society. In an effort to alleviate the impact of this waste. we have shown that scrap tire crumb rubber can be turned into value-added sulfonated carbon catalysts that can be used for a number of applications.

We find. indeed. that the effect of foam on liquid-phase mobility is not pronounced and can be ignored. Our new experimental results and analyses resolve apparent discrepancies in the literature.

Foam can improve sweep efficiency in these processes. but its direct injection would not be practical due to its poor injectivity. Field results suggest that the well injectivity can be improved if gas and surfactant solution are injected in alternating slugs. leading to foam creation inside porous medium as gas and surfactant intermingle in situ. This process. referred to as Surfactant Alternating Gas (SAG). aims at reducing gas mobility at the displacement front. Behind the front. because of low water saturation. foam collapses (partially or completely); thus. gas mobility gradually increases to its original mobility at the injection well.

We find that the net storage efficiency (ratio between the stored and captured CO2) of the carbon capture and storage (CCS)-only projects is maximally 6–56% depending on the fuel used in the power plants. With the current state of technology. the CCS process will re-emit a minimum of 0.43–0.94 kg of CO2 per kg of CO2 stored. From thermodynamics point of view. CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with CCS option is not sustainable. i.e.. during the life cycle of the process more energy is consumed than the energy produced from oil.

Modeling and assessment of the experimental data of CO2 loading capacity of SG aqueous solution are the main objectives of the present study. To this end. a well-known ensemble method namely the Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) technique was utilized in conjunction with the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm for modeling the CO2 solubility in SG solution as a function of the temperature of the system. CO2 partial pressure. and concentration of SG in the aqueous phase. Then. the Leverage method was employed for investigating the range of applicability of the developed model and quality of the collected experimental data.

Methanol is not regenerated in natural gas inhibition process due to its intermittent application in most cases. However. a significant cost is associated with the process because of methanol loss while utilizing this inhibitor. In this work. several intelligent models along with a new mathematical correlation are presented in terms of methanol concentration in aqueous phase and temperature to precisely forecast the methanol loss in the saturated hydrocarbons phase.

Nevertheless. most analyses to date have concluded that land will not pose significant constraints on this transition. Here. we estimate the land-use requirements to supply all currently consumed electricity and final energy with domestic solar energy for 40 countries considering two key issues that are usually not taken into account: (1) the need to cope with the variability of the solar resource. and (2) the real land occupation of solar technologies.

The obtained results indicate that a fast transition achieving a 100% renewable electric system globally by 2060 consistent with the Green Growth narrative could decrease the EROI of the energy system from current ~12:1 to ~3:1 by the mid-century. stabilizing thereafter at ~5:1. These EROI levels are well below the thresholds identified in the literature required to sustain industrial complex societies.

However. there have been few overall studies on the evolution of these resources. This paper uses a dynamic model to study the exhaustion patterns of world fossil and nuclear fuels and their possible replacement by renewable energy sources. The results show that peak oil will be the first restriction and it will not be easily overcome. Electric vehicles can produce some interesting savings. but they are insufficient to avoid the decline in oil. Biofuels are even more limited. due to the enormous extensions of fertile land they require and their low productivity. This shows that overcoming the decline in oil will need much more ambitious policies than the mere substitution of technology.

1278859,New climate scenario framework implementation in the GCAM integrated assessment model,2014,Iñigo Capellán Pérez and Mikel González Eguino and Ignacio Arto Olaizola and Alberto Ansuategi and Kishore Dhavala and Pralit Patel and Anil Markandya,,,,,Basque Centre for Climate Change/Klima Aldaketa Ikergai,This report has various objectives: (i) to provide an overview of the climate Integrated Assessment approach; (ii) to describe the Global Climate Assessment Model (GCAM); (iii) to outline the new IPCC scenario framework represented by the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs); and (iv) to document the implementation of the new scenario framework in version 3.1 of the GCAM. The GCAM baseline is thus calibrated to the “Middle of the Road” or SSP2 scenario using the data calculated by the OECD. The implications of this scenario are important because it will probably become a standard scenario among the research community. The exogenous variables. the implications for income convergence and the results in terms of energy mix. emissions. temperature and radiative forcing of SSP2 implementation in the GCAM are presented at both global and regional levels. These results are also compared with the GCAM-Reference baseline and the IPCC SRES representative scenarios. Then the feasibility. cost and implications of a climate policy that seeks to stabilize temperature at 2ºC (2.6 W/m2 RCP) using a global uniform carbon tax are analyzed. The study is completed by a decomposition analysis that enables the main driving factors of CO2 variation to be identified. including population. affluence. energy intensity. carbon intensity and fossil-fuel share of the energy mix. Finally we draw some conclusions and highlight points for further research.,True,2luBjEUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,13,https://addi.ehu.es/handle/10810/14271,2786000945268231733,/scholar?cites=2786000945268231733,,,https://addi.ehu.es/bitstream/handle/10810/14271/BC3WP201404.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

As sea ice melts. more open water is exposed to solar radiation. absorbing heat and generating a sea‐ice–albedo feedback that reinforces Arctic warming. Recent studies stress the significance of this feedback mechanism and suggest that ice‐free summer conditions in the Arctic Ocean may occur faster than previously expected. even under low‐emissions pathways. Here we use an integrated assessment model to explore the implications of a potentially rapid sea‐ice‐loss process. We consider a scenario leading to a full month free of sea ice in September 2050. followed by three potential trajectories afterward: partial recovery. stabilization. and continued loss of sea ice. We analyze how these scenarios affect the efforts to keep global temperature increase below 2°C.

Until very recently the carbon leakage literature has focused mainly on ‘industrial’ carbon leakage. However. there is another potential channel that has received little attention so far: the carbon leakage triggered by land-use change (‘terrestrial’ carbon leakage). In this article we use an integrated assessment model to explore these two forms of leakage in a situation where CO2 emissions in all sectors. including those from land-use change. are taxed equally. Our results show that under different fragmentation scenarios terrestrial carbon leakage may be the dominant type of leakage up to 2050.

We apply the integrated assessment model MEDEAS-World to study four global transportation decarbonization strategies for 2050. The results show that a massive replacement of oil-fueled individual vehicles to electric ones alone cannot deliver GHG reductions consistent with climate stabilization and could result in the scarcity of some key minerals. such as lithium and magnesium. In addition. energy-economy feedbacks within an economic growth system create a rebound effect that counters the benefits of substitution.

We contribute to this debate by estimating the current global average energy return on energy invested (EROI) for the five RES technologies with the highest potential of electricity generation from the comprehensive and internally consistent estimations of their material requirements at three distinct energy system boundaries: standard farm-gate (EROI st). final at consumer point-of-use (EROI final). and extended (including indirect investments. EROI ext). EROI st levels found fall within the respective literature ranges. Expanding the boundaries closer to the system level. we find that only large hydroelectricity would currently have a high EROI ext~ 6.5: 1. while the rest of variable RES would be below 3: 1: onshore wind (2.9: 1). offshore wind (2.3: 1). solar Photovoltaic (PV)(1.8: 1). and solar Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)(< 1: 1). These results indicate that. very likely. the global average EROI ext levels of variable RES are currently below those of fossil fuel-fired electricity. It remains unknown if technological improvements will be able to compensate for factors. which will become increasingly important as the variable RES scale-up.

1278871,Dynamic EROI of the global energy system in future scenarios of transition to renewable energies,2018,I Capellán-Pérez and C de Castro and LJ de Miguel,,,,,,The transition from fossil fuels to Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is an indispensable condition to achieve sustainable socio-economic systems. Despite their indisputable environmental benefits. their technical performance can be. in some cases. worse than those of fossil fuels. This is the case of the Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROI). Much work has been carried out to estimate the EROI of individual RES technologies; fierce debates about methodological issues are still not closed. In this work. we approach this issue by dynamically estimating the EROI of the whole energy system in future scenarios of transition to renewables. For this. we apply the global MEDEAS-World simulation model. which computes the dynamic EROI (standard. EROIst) of individual renewable technologies as a function of the associated energy requirements to build the infrastructure (construction phases and materials). The EROI point of use (EROIpou) of the whole energy system is obtained taking into account the additional energy investments to cope with RES intermittency (ie storage. overcapacities and overgrids) as well as the related distribution energy losses. Two scenarios up to 2050 are simulated:(1) Business-as-usual (BAU. continuation of current trends) and (2)“Green Growth”(GG. higher economic growth. faster transition to RES. higher efficiency improvements. etc.). The contribution of RES in the energy mix increases from~ 15% to over 30% in BAU and almost 50% in GG by 2050. This penetration of RES technologies in the energy mix translates into a decrease of the EROIpou of the whole energy system from current 6: 1 to 5: 1 (BAU) and below 3 …,True,2luBjEUAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,5,http://www.sustainable.soltechdesigns.com/CapellanPerezetal_DynamicEROI%20(2019_06_27%2016_10_21%20UTC).pdf,3642130556263759765,/scholar?cites=3642130556263759765,,,http://www.sustainable.soltechdesigns.com/CapellanPerezetal_DynamicEROI%20(2019_06_27%2016_10_21%20UTC).pdf,0,0,0

In extending this concept to the fast fluidization regime. the probabilities of being in each of the three regimes are represented as probability density functions derived from regime boundary transition data. The three regime‐specific models—a generalized version of a two‐phase bubbling bed model at low gas velocities. a dispersed flow model for turbulent beds at intermediate velocities. and a generalized version of a core‐annulus model at higher velocities—are employed. leading to improved predictions compared with any of the individual models. while avoiding discontinuities at the regime boundaries …,True,3QiU_TAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,85,https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aic.690490720,948168985405296444,/scholar?cites=948168985405296444,,,,0,0,0

1278896,A generalized fluidized bed reactor model across the flow regimes,2001,Ibrahim A Abba,,,,,,Description A large number of industrial catalytic and non-catalytic processes employ fluidized beds. and newer and more challenging applications are emerging. Driven by the growth in applications and the challenges they bring. reliable reactor models for fluidized beds are vital for the design. scale-up and optimal operation of these processes. Traditionally. models are often developed with a particular process in mind based on consideration of the operating conditions and flow regime of fluidization. with the range of applicability limited to the cases tested. The complexity is compounded by the existence of distinctly different flow regimes. Considerable uncertainty exists in flow regime transition criteria. and most existing models predict discontinuities at the boundaries. contrary to experimental evidence. In addition. most practically important fluid bed reactors involve complex reactions. sometimes accompanied by significant volume change. with selectivity critical. However. there are few attempts to evaluate reactor model performance using commercial-scale data with selectivity as a criterion. In this research. sponsored by the Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation in Japan. a new generic fluid bed reactor (GFBR) model is developed applicable across the flow regimes most commonly encountered in industrial scale fluid bed reactors: bubbling. turbulent and fast fluidization. The model interpolates between three regime-specific models-the generalized two-phase bubbling bed model. dispersed plug flow. and the generalized core-annulus model-by probabilistic averaging of hydrodynamic and dispersion variables based on the uncertainty in the flow …,True,3QiU_TAAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,19,https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/83l/831/items/1.0058662,18279353825781700319,/scholar?cites=18279353825781700319,,,https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/83l/831/items/1.0058662,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Fluidized bed reactor models are generally specific to a single flow regime resulting in ambiguities and discontinuities at the regime boundaries. In practice. only the bubbling. turbulent and fast fluidization regimes are of industrial significance for catalytic reactions. The turbulent fluidization regime is especially advantageous because of improved interphase mass transfer. resulting in improved selectivities and conversions. It is shown that some of the difficulties in modeling can be resolved by means of the probabilistic‐averaging model. recently published by Thompson et al. (1999). This model interpolates between the Grace (1984) two‐phase bubbling bed model at low velocities and single phase axially dispersed flow for fully established turbulent fluidization conditions. leading to improved predictions of conversion and selectivity for catalytic fluidized bed reactors operated at flow rates covering the full range …,True,3QiU_TAAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,18,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cjce.5450770216,10302216196769056218,/scholar?cites=10302216196769056218,,,,0,0,0

For materials such as NiO x  that readily form hydrous oxides. however. the smooth. compact films deposited by ALD may result in higher overpotentials due to low catalyst surface area compared to other deposition methods.

Thin films of crystalline ALD–NiO are deposited and OER activity is tested using cyclic voltammetry (CV).

We employed the intrinsically selective adsorption of an octadecylphosphonic acid self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on Cu over Si surfaces to selectively create a resist layer only on Cu. MLD was then performed on the patterns to deposit organic films predominantly on the Si surface. with only small amounts growing on the Cu regions.

In addition. a low deposition temperature of 150 °C for the deposition of metallic Pt using O3 is obtained. To investigate the role of O3 during initial growth. Pt is deposited on O3-pretreated SiO2 using air as the counter reactant. Pt deposited in this way on O3-pretreated SiO2 shows a rapid increase of surface coverage. which is similar to Pt ALD using O3 and different from Pt ALD using air on untreated SiO2.

For example. in the photoelectrochemical splitting of water. a photoanode may drive the splitting of water to molecular oxygen. 1 In a proton exchange membrane fuel cells. the opposite reaction occurs in which molecular oxygen is reduced to water. In addition. there is much interest in creating improved bifunctional catalysts for unitized regenerative fuel cell which may then be coupled to a intermittent renewable energy source to either make or store energy depending on demand. 2 The best known materials for catalyzing OER and ORR are alloys of precious metal oxides; however. these materials are expensive and scarce. In this work. we demonstrate the ability of MnOx deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) to serve as a bifunctional catalyst.

1278937,Modelling and controlling hydropower plants,2012,German Ardul Munoz-Hernandez and Dewi Ieuan Jones,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Hydroelectric power stations are a major source of electricity around the world; understanding their dynamics is crucial to achieving good performance. The electrical power generated is normally controlled by individual feedback loops on each unit. The reference input to the power loop is the grid frequency deviation from its set point. thus structuring an external frequency control loop. The book discusses practical and well-documented cases of modelling and controlling hydropower stations. focused on a pumped storage scheme based in Dinorwig. North Wales. These accounts are valuable to specialist control engineers who are working in this industry. In addition. the theoretical treatment of modern and classic controllers will be useful for graduate and final year undergraduate engineering students. This book reviews SISO and MIMO models. which cover the linear and nonlinear characteristics of pumped storage hydroelectric power stations. The most important dynamic features are discussed. The verification of these models by hardware in the loop simulation is described. To show how the performance of a pumped storage hydroelectric power station can be improved. classical and modern controllers are applied to simulated models of Dinorwig power plant. that include PID.

1278938,A robust nonlinear observer for real-time attitude estimation using low-cost MEMS inertial sensors,2013,José Fermi Guerrero-Castellanos and Heberto Madrigal-Sastre and Sylvain Durand and Lizeth Torres and German Ardul Munoz-Hernández,13,Sensors,11,15138-15158,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper deals with the attitude estimation of a rigid body equipped with angular velocity sensors and reference vector sensors. A quaternion-based nonlinear observer is proposed in order to fuse all information sources and to obtain an accurate estimation of the attitude. It is shown that the observer error dynamics can be separated into two passive subsystems connected in “feedback”. Then. this property is used to show that the error dynamics is input-to-state stable when the measurement disturbance is seen as an input and the error as the state. These results allow one to affirm that the observer is “robustly stable”. The proposed observer is evaluated in real-time with the design and implementation of an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) based on low-cost MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) Inertial Measure Unit (IMU) and magnetic sensors and a 16-bit microcontroller. The resulting estimates are compared with a high precision motion system to demonstrate its performance.

The parameters and other features of such a set of hydrogeneration units have been used to perform the respective tuning up. In order to assess the behavior of this controlled system. a model of such nonlinear plant is regulated through a classical PID by classical linearization of its set points. and then a pseudo-derivative part is substituted into a Fractional PID.

1278948,Estimating the frequency variation of the Mexican grid by Kalman filtering,2009,GA Munoz-Hernandez and Alejandro Diaz-Sanchez and Dewi I Jones and JG Hernandez-Delgado and CA Vega-Lebrun,,,,245-249,IEEE,This work describes the use of Kalman filtering to estimate the changes of frequency of the Mexican grid. An off-line analysis of the frequency variation is presented. This analysis was done using real data extracted from the Mexican grid during August 2004. It is shown that. although the Kalman indexes do not converge to an exact value. they maintain a low variation following the initial iterative steps. The precision of the estimation is limited by unknown load disturbances but this technique could be useful to predict the frequency variation and also the load variation of the Mexican grid.,True,o7LDoIAAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,6,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5163926/,825487790655208568,/scholar?cites=825487790655208568,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/A_Diaz-sanchez/publication/221632464_Estimating_the_Frequency_Variation_of_the_Mexican_Grid_by_Kalman_Filtering/links/00463527a8685b5bed000000/Estimating-the-Frequency-Variation-of-the-Mexican-Grid-by-Kalman-Filtering.pdf,0,0,0

This system is driven by low grade heat sources such as solar energy. geothermal or waste heat. This system combines a supercritical organic Rankine cycle (SORC). an ejector and a multi-effect distillation (MED) desalination system. which could be used for seawater or concentrated brine such as frac flowback water produced during natural gas mining.

The non-linear collocated equations are solved using the Levenberg–Marquardt method. The primary novelty of this approach is that the N–S equation is solved directly. instead of using an iterative algorithm for the primitive variables. Two flow situations are considered: Couette flow with and without pressure gradient. and 2D laminar flow in a duct with and without flow obstruction. The approach is validated by comparing the Couette flow results with the analytical solution and the 2D results with those obtained using the well-validated CFD-ACE™ commercial package.,True,igCUctcAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,41,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X07001436,13528690100866541257,/scholar?cites=13528690100866541257,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X07001436,0,0,0

The cycle combines a Rankine and an absorption refrigeration cycle. The Goswami cycle can be used in a wide range of applications including recovering waste heat as a bottoming cycle or generating power from non-conventional sources like solar radiation or geothermal energy. A thermodynamic study of power and cooling co-generation is presented for heat source temperatures between 100 to 350 C. A comprehensive analysis of the effect of several operation and configuration parameters. including the number of turbine stages and different superheating configurations. on the power output and the thermal and exergy efficiencies was conducted. Results showed the Goswami cycle can operate at an effective exergy efficiency of 60–80% with thermal efficiencies between 25 to 31%. The investigation also showed that multiple stage turbines had a better performance than single stage turbines when heat source temperatures remain above 200 C in terms of power. thermal and exergy efficiencies. However. the effect of turbine stages is almost the same when heat source temperatures were below 175 C. For multiple turbine stages. the use of partial superheating with Single or Double Reheat stream showed a better performance in terms of efficiency. It also showed an increase in exergy destruction when heat source temperature was increased.

The study covers the development of the method from simple surface exchange problems to enclosure problems containing absorbing. emitting and isotropically/anisotropically scattering medium. The accuracy of the MCM was first evaluated by applying the method to cubical enclosure problems. The first one of the cubical enclosure problems was prediction of radiative heat flux vector in a cubical enclosure containing purely. isotropically and anisotropically scattering medium with non-symmetric boundary conditions. Then. the prediction of radiative heat flux vector in an enclosure containing absorbing. emitting. isotropically and anisotropically scattering medium with symmetric boundary conditions was evaluated. The predicted solutions were compared with the solutions of method of lines solution (MOL) of discrete ordinates method (DOM). The method was then applied to predict the incident heat fluxes on the freeboard walls of a bubbling fluidized bed combustor. and the solutions were compared with those of MOL of DOM and experimental measurements.

These suggested reaction mechanisms are justified under several assumptions: (1) the bicarbonate ion is a major proton donor. (2) the gaseous CO2 is a carbon source. (3) the reaction mechanism is unaffected by the applied potentials outside the Tafel region. etc. However. recent electrokinetic studies combined with in situ and isotopic experiments raise a question that the above conventional assumptions may not always be valid. Furthermore. there are unresolved issues between the mechanisms suggested by electrokinetic studies.

We discovered that the electrochemical activation environment using CO2-bubbled electrolyte during reducing ZnO in a pretreatment step is important for highly selective CO production over H2 production. while using Ar gas bubbling instead can lead to less CO product of the Zn-based catalyst in CO2RR later. The RE-Zn activated in CO2-bubbled electrolyte condition achieves a Faradaic efficiency of CO production (FECO) of 78.5%. which is about 10% higher than that of RE-Zn activated in Ar-bubbled electrolyte.

For a 40% increase in the cost of imported power system components. the cost of energy was found to be either 0.352 €/kWh for a 5 kW pico-hydro generator with 72 kWh storage or 0.396 €/kWh for a 3 kWp photovoltaic generator with 36 kWh storage. These energy costs were obtained with a biomass resource cost of 25 €/tonne. The pH and PV hybrid systems both required the parallel operation of a 3.3 kW battery inverter with a 10 kW biogas generator. The pH/biogas/battery systems simulated for villages located in the south of Cameroon with a flow rate of at least 92 l/s …,True,Ip9CZWcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,142,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096014810800387X,17611521944836933063,/scholar?cites=17611521944836933063,,,,0,0,0

1279002,Optimal scheduling of large-scale hydrothermal power systems using the Lagrangian relaxation technique,2000,JM Ngundam and F Kenfack and T Tamo Tatiétsé,22,International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,4,237-245,Elsevier,This paper describes a method for scheduling large-scale hydrothermal power systems based on the Lagrangian relaxation technique. Lagrangian multipliers are introduced to decompose the original problem into small independent subproblems one for each generating unit. which are solved through a three level calculation structure. Using this approach. a large-scale hydrothermal electric power system could be treated as a precise general problem that takes into account the following among other factors: (a) random load demand; (b) non-linear cost function of thermal production; (c) variations of water head in hydroelectric plants; (d) non-linear function of hydroelectric output; (e) a system of cascaded hydroelectric plants including regulation reservoirs with limited spillage capacity. An economic interpretation of the results is given and an illustrative application of the technique is presented.,True,Ip9CZWcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,79,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014206159900054X,14133498379704998326,/scholar?cites=14133498379704998326,,,,0,0,0

1279003,Modelling of wind/Diesel/battery hybrid power systems for far North Cameroon,2008,EM Nfah and JM Ngundam,49,Energy conversion and management,6,1295-1301,Pergamon,Wind/Diesel/battery hybrid power systems have been modelled for electrification of typical rural households and schools in remote areas of the Far North Province of Cameroon. The wind resource of Maroua Salak for the period 1991–1995 was used in this modelling. The diurnal and monthly patterns of wind speeds at Maroua show that wind speeds in the range 3–6 m/s occur from 9:00 to 15:00 for eight months. The time duration of wind speeds in this interval was found to be 36.1%. The annual capacity factors computed for low start up wind turbines from China were found to be in the range 20–40%. Two wind turbines with rated powers 180 W and 290 W attained acceptable capacity factors of 38 and 40% and were used in sizing wind hybrid systems for typical rural households energy needs in the range 70–300 kWh per year. It was also found that a wind/Diesel hybrid power system based on a combination of …,True,Ip9CZWcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,70,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890408000253,8042454808228573996,/scholar?cites=8042454808228573996,,,,0,0,0

Ltd.,This paper presents the investment planning model. which has been developed to rigorously valorize the large hydroelectric potential resources of Cameroon.Based on Benders technique. the decomposition approach proposed allows each component of the problem (investment and operation) to be conveniently modelled and solved by adapted methods. Furthermore. the relative small size of the actual system. the long experience of the manual generation management in use over a long time by the national electricity company (Sonel). and the fundamental data of the problem are exploited as the basis of the approach. to define a more detailed and adapted model. Formulated as a multistage mixed linear programming problem. the decomposition procedure of the Benders technique is applied to isolate from the problem so modelled its two main subproblems (investment and operation).

1279006,Identification of stakeholders for sustainable renewable energy applications in Cameroon,2012,EM Nfah and JM Ngundam,16,,7,4661-4666,Pergamon,This paper examined the initiation. funding. realisation and the current state of some renewable energy applications in the West Region of Cameroon. The findings from the study conducted showed that all of the renewable energy applications were initiated by indigenes living outside the beneficiary communities. The lack of fee-for-service tariffs was partly responsible for the failure of a wind electric installation for potable water pumping. Conflicts in a local management committee resulted in the inoperative state of a pico-hydro installation. while the lack of finances accounted for the failure of a PV system of rural Health Centre. Although. some successful results were noted in the activities of African Center for Renewable and Sustainable Technologies (ACREST) involving foreign technical expertise in small scale renewable energy applications.
