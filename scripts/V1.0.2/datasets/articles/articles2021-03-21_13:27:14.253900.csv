1204805,A qualitative study of users' engagement with real-time feedback from in-house energy consumption displays,2013,Christian Oltra and Alex Boso and Josep Espluga and Ana Prades,61,Energy Policy,,788-792,Elsevier,Recent developments in feedback technologies and smart meters have advanced the introduction of energy consumption displays in the home. This could facilitate a significant amount of energy saving for the maximum number of homeowners. But empirical studies show that achieved savings in electricity consumption from in-house displays range approximately from 0 to 20%. In order to qualitatively explore the factors underlying such variation in the achieved saving. this paper studies how a small sample of householders interacted with the feedback from an energy consumption display. Following a heuristic model based on prior energy-related behavioral research. we explore the effects of the in-home display on household electricity. Results indicate that saving might be moderated by the level of user's engagement with the display. preceded by user's motivation to save energy. prior attitudes and. importantly …,True,qVF1COkAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C,47,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513006344,16795596395085970713,/scholar?cites=16795596395085970713,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Oltra/publication/273531785_A_qualitative_study_of_users%27_engagement_with_real-time_feedback_from_in-house_energy_consumption_displays/links/5c6d18c1299bf1e3a5b68447/A-qualitative-study-of-users-engagement-with-real-time-feedback-from-in-house-energy-consumption-displays.pdf,0,0,0

Recent claims in the literature suggest that despite such stigmatisation. lay views on such technologies may be shifting towards a “reluctant acceptance.” in the light of concerns about issues like anthropogenic climate change. In this paper. we report on research into learning and reasoning processes concerned with a largely unknown nuclear energy technology; namely fusion power. We focus on the role of the nuclear label. or “brand.” in informing how lay citizens make sense of the nature of this technology.

The ‘multi-level perspective’ is now a widely used framework to understand and promote the upscaling of local innovation niches. such as agroecology. to broader scales (e.g.. regional. national. international). thus reconfiguring the dominant socio-technical regimes. Additionally. emergent ‘hybrid forums’ can provide a space between niche and regime where niche innovators can become important actors in scaling up and out emergent innovations.

Sevilla: Fundación Nueva Cultura del Agua,,,,Durante años los poderes públicos han suministrado y gestionado los servicios que les competen de una forma estrictamente jurídica o predominantemente tecnocrática. No en vano. los modelos imperantes de democracia representativa y de organización interna de las instituciones públicas han facilitado que quien detenta el poder puede tomar decisiones sin demasiados contrapesos y. además. se le responsabiliza política y legalmente de hacerlo. En este contexto. para tomar las “mejores” decisiones los poderes públicos históricamente han buscado el asesoramiento de diversos tipos de expertos (ingenieros. abogados. técnicos ambientales. urbanistas. etc.). poseedores de métodos y técnicas capaces de proveer los conocimientos más “válidos” sobre la realidad en cuestión (Borja y Castells. 1998; Espluga. 2005; Subirats. 1999).

En todos los países democráticos se observa que la legitimidad de las instituciones públicas tiende a deteriorarse poco a poco ante una ciudadanía cada vez más reflexiva y crítica. con nuevos valores que no pueden ser satisfechos con la simple provisión tecnocrática de servicios públicos (Font. 2000; Unión Europea. 2001).

Coping with career breaks does not inevitably result in a personal crisis including psychological damage for each individual experiencing them. Yet it must be emphasized that such an experience might lead to long-term unemployment especially for members of vulnerable groups. and this situation is often linked to the experience of social exclusion.The series discusses topics that look into the individual. organizational. and social-psychological effects of career transitions and the resulting risks of social exclusion.

Although the engagement of stakeholders is a key factor for the eradication programme's success. social factors have been often ignored in the control programmes of animal diseases. especially in developed countries. In this study. we used a qualitative approach to investigate perceptions. opinions. attitudes and beliefs of farmers and veterinarians that may influence the effectiveness of the Spanish bTB eradication programme. The study was carried out in two phases. Firstly. 13 key representatives of different groups involved in the programme were interviewed through exploratory interviews to identify most relevant themes circulating in the population. Interviews focused on strong and weak points of the programme; reasons for failure to achieve eradication; benefits of being disease free; future perspectives and proposed changes to the programme. Based on these results. a thematic guide was developed and detailed information was gained through face-to-face in-depth interviews conducted on a purposive sample of 39 farmers and veterinarians. Data was analysed following an ethnographic methodology. Main results suggested that the bTB programme is perceived as a law enforcement duty without an adequate motivation of some stakeholders and a general feeling of distrust arose.

Aquí se presentan algunos de los resultados de una investigación exploratoria sobre las respuestas sociales a este riesgo tecnológico realizada en Cataluña. Se observa que. ni las medidas adoptadas por las empresas del sector (básicamente intentar ofrecer más información). ni las adoptadas por las administraciones públicas (básicamente generar normativas no siempre coordinadas entre si) sirvieron para mitigar el conflicto. Los resultados avalan algunos de los postulados de las recientes teorías sociales sobre la percepción social del riesgo (Wynne. etc.). en el sentido de que. en ocasiones. la oposición popular parece más relacionada con aspectos institucionales (quién gestiona el riesgo. cómo lo hace. etc.). que con los posibles daños a la salud. lo cual permite relacionar las respuestas sociales ante los riesgos tecnológicos con demandas de una gestión más transparente y/o participativa de dichos riesgos.,True,qVF1COkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,13,https://www.raco.cat/index.php/papers/article/view/57982,16498015888393785269,/scholar?cites=16498015888393785269,,https://www.raco.cat/index.php/Papers/article/download/57982/68050/,0,0,0

A variety of public participation procedures exist that aim to consult and involve the public. ranging from the public hearing to the consensus conference. Unfortunately. a general lack of empirical consideration of the quality of these methods arises from confusion as to the appropriate benchmarks for evaluation. Given that the quality of the output of any participation exercise is difficult to determine. the authors suggest the need to consider which aspects of the process are desirable and then to measure the presence or quality of these process aspects. To this end. a number of theoretical evaluation criteria that are essential for effective public participation are specified.

Findings suggest that Delphi groups outperform statistical groups (by 12 studies to two with two ‘ties’) and standard interacting groups (by five studies to one with two ‘ties’). although there is no consistent evidence that the technique outperforms other structured group procedures. However. important differences exist between the typical laboratory version of the technique and the original concept of Delphi. which make generalisations about ‘Delphi’ per se difficult.

The merits of participation. however. are difficult to ascertain. as there are relatively few cases in which the effectiveness of participation exercises have been studied in a structured (as opposed to highly subjective) manner.

1204835,Expert opinions in forecasting: the role of the Delphi technique,2001,Gene Rowe and George Wright,,,,125-144,Springer. Boston. MA,Expert opinion is often necessary in forecasting tasks because of a lack of appropriate or available information for using statistical procedures. But how does one get the best forecast from experts? One solution is to use a structured group technique. such as Delphi. for eliciting and combining expert judgments. In using the Delphi technique. one controls the exchange of information between anonymous panelists over a number of rounds (iterations). taking the average of the estimates on the final round as the group judgment. A number of principles are developed here to indicate how to conduct structured groups to obtain good expert judgments. These principles. applied to the conduct of Delphi groups. indicate how many and what type of experts to use (five to 20 experts with disparate domain knowledge); how many rounds to use (generally two or three); what type of feedback to employ (average estimates …,True,16cj1IoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,846,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-306-47630-3_7,9770022342442423124,/scholar?cites=9770022342442423124,,https://www.gwern.net/docs/predictions/2001-rowe.pdf,0,0,0

After briefly reviewing the technique. we consider problems with Delphi from two perspectives. First. we examine methodological and technical difficulties and the problems these have brought about in experimental applications. We suggest that important differences exist between the typical laboratory Delphi and the original concept of Delphi. These differences. reflecting a lack of control of important group characteristics/factors (such as the relative level of panelist expertise). make comparisons between Delphi studies unrealistic. as are generalizations from laboratory studies to the ideal of Delphi.

Results reveal that the accuracy of judgmental probability forecasts increases over Delphi rounds (in terms of proportion correct and appropriateness of confidence) when statistical summaries or written rationales are provided from other members of an individual's nominal group. but does not increase in a control iteration condition (without feedback). Additionally. subjects who gave more appropriate probability forecasts on the first round exhibited least opinion change. although measures of confidence were unrelated to opinion change. Results also show that majority opinion exerts strong opinion pull on minority opinion even when the majority favours an incorrect answer (irrespective of the nature of feedback provided).

These developments entail the participation and deliberative involvement by lay publics in planning. decision-making and policy-making situations. In this paper we argue that citizen engagement exercises can usefully be understood as information systems.

Australia and Europe,2018,John Whitton and Matthew Cotton and Ioan M Charnley-Parry and Kathy Brasier,,,,,Routledge,Shale energy development is an issue of global importance. The number of reserves globally. and their potential economic return. have increased dramatically in the past decade. Questions abound. however. about the appropriate governance systems to manage the risks of unconventional oil and gas development and the ability for citizens to engage and participate in decisions regarding these systems. Stakeholder participation is essential for the social and political legitimacy of energy extraction and production. what the industry calls a'social license'to operate. This book attempts to bring together critical themes inherent in the energy governance literature and illustrate them through cases in multiple countries. including the US. the UK. Canada. South Africa. Germany and Poland. These themes include how multiple actors and institutions–industry. governments and regulatory bodies at all scales. communities. opposition movements. and individual landowners–have roles in developing. contesting. monitoring. and enforcing practices and regulations within unconventional oil and gas development. Overall. the book proposes a systemic. participatory. community-led approach required to achieve a form of legitimacy that allows communities to derive social priorities by a process of community visioning.

The aim of this report is to identify a number of core principles that reflect effective and positive engagement and. in turn. aspects of poor or ineffective engagement that should be mitigated or avoided during future programmes. By identifying a series of ‘principles for engagement’. we seek to provide guidance on future engagement practices and programmes. among both nuclear stakeholders and those in other technological fields. We identify principles of engagement that are applicable beyond those scenarios involving nuclear power development. and even energy more generally. To define a desirable engagement future. it is necessary to understand what principles or values are required to ensure fair and equitable engagement. Whilst it is impossible to predict the complexity and behaviour of human and social systems. it is possible to elicit the principles or values that have contributed significantly to the perception of successful engagement.

With a greater focus on social sustainability research in recent years (Colantonio. 2007. 2009; Dillard. Dujon and King. 2009; Vallance. Perkins and Dixon. 2011). academics and authors have sought to understand social sustainability and its critical components. In this paper. we reflect on our research journey towards a conceptual framework for social sustainability. We describe how our earlier research on the role of dialogue during decision making for large scale energy infrastructure projects in the UK has led us to propose a conceptual framework for the inclusion of social sustainability criteria in decision making within a range of settings. The decisions made regarding the management of new and aging energy infrastructure are of local. national and international importance. We embrace the move towards a participatory based form of dialogue in decisions rather than a technocratic ‘top down’. expert-led.‘one-way’form of consultation. In this approach. dialogue is not only ‘two-way’. but multi-directional and dimensional. incorporating multiple stakeholders (Innes and Booher. 2004). This shift in the nature of the energy stakeholder-industry relationship in the UK has been documented by Whitton (2009. 2010).

1204874,Strategic stakeholder dialogue and social sustainability indicator development for nuclear decision-making in Anglesey. North Wales,2017,Ioan Parry,,,,,,As new nuclear power developments  are  proposed for the UK over the coming decades. it is important that public engagement and decision-making processes for these developments are carried out as effectively and sustainably as possible to benefit both current and future generations and mitigate negative social impact and conflict. particularly at the local scale. Alternative approaches are required to those employed historically. which were often expert-led. public-excluding. and vulnerable to extensive critique and opposition. particularly for large-scale and often contentious industrial or technological developments. The  research  employs  a  mixed-method  approach  to engage with different social groups in Anglesey. North Wales. a predominantly rural island where the Wylfa Newydd Nuclear Power Station is proposed  to be developed. Quantitative  and  qualitative techniques are employed to study intra-community social priorities. both generally and development- related. in order to highlight important social sustainability issues for a potential development. The four social groups that participated in this research included two secondary school student groups (YUB and  YSTJ    Students)   and   two   adult   groups   (YSTJ Teachers and CTGYM Farmers). reflecting multi- generational representation. Similarities and differences between groups are highlighted which suggests that engagement with ‘the public’ may be more effective if a strategic. social group and priority-based approach was employed. working with existing social collectives at the local scale.

The aim of this report is to identify a number of core principles that reflect effective and positive engagement and. in turn. aspects of poor or ineffective engagement that should be mitigated or avoided during future programmes. By identifying a series of ‘principles for engagement’. we seek to provide guidance on future engagement practices and programmes. among both nuclear stakeholders and those in other technological fields. We identify principles of engagement that are applicable beyond those scenarios involving nuclear power development. and even energy more generally. To define a desirable engagement future. it is necessary to understand what principles or values are required to ensure fair and equitable engagement. Whilst it is impossible to predict the complexity and behaviour of human and social systems. it is possible to elicit the principles or values that have contributed significantly to the perception of successful engagement. Authors such as Bond et al.(2004) have undertaken similar exercises to this in reviewing and detailing broad principles of public participation. part of which involved studying the public engagement approach for assessing different decommissioning proposals for Trawsfynnydd Nuclear Power Station in North Wales.

Prot,,S23,,We have discussed previously that a community-based. asset-based approach is required to achieve any sense of how social sustainability can be defined in a community setting within the context of energy developments. Our approach aims to initiate a lasting change within ‘energy’communities through building social capital; focusing on community assets not deficits to define their social priorities. Through deliberation. we develop an understanding of social sustainability so that a community is well placed to enter discussions with government and industry regarding large energy developments that will directly affect them. We review the 2015 Generic Design Assessment (GDA) Public Dialogue Pilot process for potential new nuclear reactors in the UK. We examine the aims of the dialogue. giving particular attention to a comparison between the national sampling of citizens for the GDA and the local community-based. deliberative approach we have proposed previously. We find an ongoing tension between ‘national’engagement processes (such as the GDA Public Dialogue Pilot process) and the specific requirements of those energy communities that live adjacent or close to energy infrastructure. manifested here by a conflict between the requirements of the convenor and those of participants regarding priority issues for discussion.

This is informed by the view that actively engaging citizens and communities in developing and implementing strategic responses to climate change will be critical due to:• the extent of the transformations and innovation in social. economic and environmental and economic institutions and relationships likely to be required;• the value of decentralised.‘locally distributed’production. distribution and governance systems as key elements in innovative and effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies;• the importance of maximising the resilience and adaptation of local communities; and• the extent of the changes in the behaviour of individuals. households and communities likely to be required. This paper provides a critical overview of evidence about the value and effectiveness of citizen and community engagement strategies. drawing on recent detailed research into climate change community engagement initiatives in Victoria. Australia. This research combined an extensive literature review with roundtable interviews. surveys and case studies of climate change community engagement initiatives.

XRD analysis of the as-cast glasses showed a tendency for the products to remain amorphous when melted under neutral conditions and for metallic silver to develop in the reduced melts. EXAFS analysis revealed (MoO4)2− tetrahedra in all glasses regardless of the sparge applied during melting. The glasses were heat treated to simulate an interruption to the cooling system used to prevent heat build-up in the vitrified product store.

The inversion of the complex structure‐to‐image relation is performed by numerical optimization of the configuration space of object models. Unlike structure refinement in X‐ray crystallography. the method operates on unknown defect structures on a nanometre scale. The diversity of crystal defects examined and the differences in microscope types and alignment conditions makes it necessary to adapt the basic algorithm to a broad variety of needs resulting in a modular program package for general use.

HREM image analysis is treated as a high-dimensional numerical optimization problem. The configuration space is found to be highly multi-modal with local optima in both the sub-spaces for the structures and for the imaging parameters.

Overheating and true melting by the electron beam is shown not to be an explanation due to the ultra-sharp boundary between transformed and intact material. We propose that the observed fluidisation (quasi-melting) of glasses can be caused by effective bond breaking processes induced by the energetic electrons in the electron beam. The bond breaking processes modify the effective viscosity of glasses to a low activation energy regime. The higher the electron flux density the lower is the viscosity. Quasi-melting of glasses at high enough electron flux densities can result in shape modification of nano-sized particles including formation of perfect beads due to surface tension.

Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is a technology that allows fabrication of complex-shaped objects from powder-based materials. according to a three-dimensional (3D) computer model. With DMLS. it is possible to fabricate titanium dental implants with an inherently porous surface. a key property required of implantation devices. Objective. The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence for the reliability of DMLS titanium dental implants and their clinical and histologic/histomorphometric outcomes. as well as their mechanical properties. Materials and Methods. Electronic database searches were performed. Inclusion criteria were clinical and radiographic studies. histologic/histomorphometric studies in humans and animals. mechanical evaluations. and in vitro cell culture studies on DMLS titanium implants. Meta-analysis could be performed only for randomized controlled trials (RCTs); to evaluate the methodological quality of observational human studies. the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was used. Results. Twenty-seven studies were included in this review. No RCTs were found. and meta-analysis could not be performed. The outcomes of observational human studies were assessed using the NOS: these studies showed medium methodological quality. Conclusions.

These include decarboxylation to give trans‐1.3‐pentadiene. esterification to give ethyl sorbate. reduction to give 4‐hexenol and 4‐hexenoic acid. It was shown that seven Penicillium species could convert sorbic acid into 1.3‐pentadiene whilst P. bilaii. P. fellutanum and P. glabrum did not. However. most Eurotium species were unable to bring about this conversion. Considerable differences in the resistance of two isolates of P. crustosum to sorbic acid were found. An isolate from coconut was more resistant than one isolated from hazelnuts. Both sorbic acid and caproic acid (hexanoic) brought about disorganization of the mitochondrial membranes in P. crustosum.

These monolayers have been characterized by grazing angle FTIR spectroscopy. Tribological mechanisms were explored using initial molecular conformation order. sliding distance. normal load. and substrate compliance as experimental variables. Results indicate that the initial conformational disorder of the molecules determines the level of friction at the commencement of sliding. Adverse changes in dynamic friction and monolayer life during sliding are not thermally induced but are related to substrate roughness and local plasticity. Plastic deformation reduces the spatial density of the alkylsilane monolayer and is accentuated by an increase in the normal load. ,True,dyzRg70AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,51,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp054074e,13304329901349989340,/scholar?cites=13304329901349989340,,,0,0,0

Na‐CMC is usually synthesized by the alkali catalyzed reaction of cellulose with monochloroacetic acid. The functional properties of Na‐CMC depend on the degree of substitution of the cellulose structure (i.e. how many of the hydroxyl groups are substituted per monomer unit). and also on the chain length of the cellulose backbone. The degree of substitution of Na‐CMC is usually determined according to ASTM D1439 which evolves the conversion of the Na‐CMC to free acid then again forming Na‐CMC by adding excess alkali and finally titrating the excess alkali with standard hydrochloric acid (0.3 N).

It is shown that columnar films display two regimes of responses: one dominated by columnar sliding at a critical shear stress which is determined substantially by the residual stress in the film. and the other. more damaging response. characterized by fracture. The transition to cracking modes of response is aided by a soft substrate and a thick film and can be understood from a relative comparison of the driving forces for the different modes by analytically simulating the response of an elastic bi-layer to Hertzian loading. The above comparison suggests that the relative success of columnar films. vis-à-vis amorphous or equi-axed films. is probably due to the existence of this relatively benign mode of columnar shear.

Multilayers display an enhanced resistance. which increases with layer refinement. to the multiple fracture modes that appear at high loads in these materials. including edge (nested) cracks and inclined shear cracks. Measurements of layer thickness reveal that multilayers display additional modes of plastic deformation that lead to permanent compression and bending of the film. An elastic model of contact deformation in a bilayer where plasticity is mimicked by greatly enhanced elastic compliance of the film is used to rationalize the trends in crack resistance.

At all relative humidities (RH < 70%). the friction coefficient first increases with sliding time. as defects build up in the monolayer. and then subsequently decreases. The deliberate introduction of defects by heat treatment of the monolayer to 130 °C leads to a substantial increase in the friction coefficient in a dry environment but a decrease in a moist environment. It is proposed that the interaction of water adsorbed to the steel probe with the monolayer results in a softening of the monolayer and a decrease in the relaxation times of the processes responsible for energy dissipation in the monolayer in a dry environment.

Like children we use them as building blocks—think of writing with ink made of single atoms by using scanning tunneling microscopy1 and of constructing complex origami by using DNA. 2 Or. like a voyeur. just watching single molecules go about their business. 3 To those who studied quantum mechanics with a reflective turn of mind. this may seem magical and seem to risk violating the laws of quantum mechanics. but it does not. This viewpoint will focus on single-molecule fluorescence methods4 and leave for another day the equally interesting problem of single-molecule force measurements. for example. the tour de force of measuring the stress–strain properties of individual chains. 5 We will focus on how the problems of polymers differ from those of biophysics. where single-molecule fluorescence methods have had so much impact. We emphasize unsolved problems and areas for useful future research.One wonders what Boltzmann would have said—after all. to see each molecule in a gas wouldn’t teach us anything that we don’t know already. Boltzmann might have argued that to visualize single molecules is a giant step backward. The point of statistical mechanics is to put discussion on a higher level than this; concepts such as entropy allow us to avoid clumsy accounting of each molecule. In a gas. we know the underlying distribution of interesting observables. and anyway we are more interested in aggregate properties such as pressure and temperature than in the trajectories of individual molecules.

The present study was undertaken to observe the effect of quantity of carbon on biological denitrification with Pseudomonas stutzeri at different C/N ratios. The results obtained in the present investigations show that the pH and alkalinity of the effluent increased with increase in C/N ratio due to alkalinity generated during denitrification. The COD of the influent was increased with increase in C/N ratio. The effluent COD was nil under pseudo-steady state condition up to the C/N ratio of 2.5. Above this C/N ratio. the organics started entering in the treated water. The maximum feasible economic reduction of NO (3-) N from 51.6 mg/l to 1.2 mg/l occurred at C/N ratio of 2.5 and the obtained concentration of NO (3-) N was found to be lower than the tolerance limit (10 mg/l) prescribed by the WHO.

Systematic changes in latex suspension concentration are found to affect lateral drying heterogeneity and surface topology. A nonmonotonic decay in contact angle is observed at the edges of drying droplets by continuously monitoring evaporation dynamics. which is quantitatively characterized by the peak strain and peak formation time. An analytical model is developed to explain the nonmonotonic contact-angle decay by considering a transient dilational stress imposed on a viscoelastic solid model for the particle network. Importantly. the latex concentration dependence of this phenomenon provides evidence for a smooth transition from fluid-line pinning to fluid-line recession behavior during drying. leading to ringlike to volcanolike …,True,fmY_7PUAAAAJ:-z4IEurqN94C,2,https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.2.114304,304116724736485584,/scholar?cites=304116724736485584,,http://schroeder.scs.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PhysRevFluids.2.114304.pdf,0,0,0

Whilst humans rely on our senses to move through crowds. particles 10000 times smaller than a human hair move randomly among obstacles. in bursts of caged transport. At the molecular level. particles bump and jostle and diffuse randomly to the rhythm of thermal energy. The crowding elements also fluctuate randomly. but to a different beat because they are usually of dissimilar size. This makes the space between dancing bodies ever-changing and spontaneous. My graduate research aims to uncover the nature of single-particle motion on this molecular dance floor which is important for future design of advanced materials. in drug delivery and cellular biology.

A ruthenium complex dye. cis-di (thiocyanato)-bis (-bipyridyl--dicarboxylate) ruthenium (II)(usually known as N3) was used to sensitize these surfaces. The N3 coverage dependence of the incident photon to current efficiencies (IPCE) was measured for all four surfaces. IPCE values were much higher on anatase (101) and rutile (100) than on the other two surfaces. The kinetics of N3 adsorption was also studied on the four surfaces. The adsorption kinetics for a slow adsorption step could be fit with a Langmuir kinetic model.

Berkeley. CA (US),This study used a state-of-the-art planning model called SWITCH for the electric power system to investigate the evolution of the power systems of California and western North America from present-day to 2050 in the context of deep decarbonization of the economy. Researchers concluded that drastic power system carbon emission reductions were feasible by 2050 under a wide range of possible futures. The average cost of power in 2050 would range between $149 to $232 per megawatt hour across scenarios. a 21 to 88 percent increase relative to a business-as-usual scenario. and a 38 to 115 percent increase relative to the present-day cost of power. The power system would need to undergo sweeping change to rapidly decarbonize. Between present-day and 2030 the evolution of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council power system was dominated by implementing aggressive energy efficiency measures. installing renewable energy and gas-fired generation facilities and retiring coal-fired generation. Deploying wind. solar and geothermal power in the 2040 timeframe reduced power system emissions by displacing gas-fired generation. This trend continued for wind and solar in the 2050 timeframe but was accompanied by large amounts of new storage and long-distance high-voltage transmission capacity.

Four key elements are found to be critical for the State to achieve its 2050 goal of 80 percent greenhouse (GHG) reductions from the 1990 level: aggressive energy efficiency; clean electricity; widespread electrification of passenger vehicles. building heating. and industry heating; and large-scale production of low-carbon footprint biofuels to largely replace petroleum-based liquid fuels. The approach taken here is that technically achievable energy efficiency measures are assumed to be achieved by 2050 and aggregated with the other key elements mentioned above to estimate resultant emissions in 2050. The energy and non-energy sectors are each assumed to             havethe objective of meeting an 80 percent reduction from their respective 1990 GHG levels for the purposes of analysis. A different partitioning of energy and non-energy sector GHG greenhouse reductions is allowed if emission reductions in one sector are more economic or technically achievable than in the other. Similarly. within the energy or non-energy sectors. greater or less than 80 percent reduction from 1990 is allowed for sub-sectors within the energy or non-energy sectors as long as the overall target is achieved.

In particular. skeletal muscles experience severe declines during aging. a phenomenon termed sarcopenia. Despite the high incidence and severity of sarcopenia. little is known about contributing factors and development. Many studies focus on functional aspects of aging-related tissue decline. while structural details remain understudied. Traditional approaches for quantifying structural changes have assessed individual markers at discrete intervals. Such approaches are inadequate for the complex changes associated with aging. An alternative is to consider changes in overall morphology rather than in specific markers. We have used this approach to quantitatively track tissue architecture during adulthood and aging in the C. elegans pharynx. the neuromuscular feeding organ. Using pattern recognition to analyze aged-grouped pharynx images. we identified discrete step-wise transitions between distinct morphologies. The morphology state transitions were maintained in mutants with pharynx neurotransmission defects. although the pace of the transitions was altered. Longitudinal measurements of pharynx function identified a predictive relationship between mid-life pharynx morphology and function at later ages. These studies demonstrate for the first time that adult tissues undergo distinct structural transitions reflecting postdevelopmental events. The processes that underlie these architectural changes may contribute to increased disease risk during aging. and may be targets for factors that alter the aging rate.

Researchers concluded that drastic power system carbon emission reductions were feasible by 2050 under a wide range of possible futures. The average cost of power in 2050 would range between $149 to $232 per megawatt hour across scenarios. a 21 to 88 percent increase relative to a business-as-usual scenario. and a 38 to 115 percent increase relative to the present-day cost of power.

This technique provides fast and effective sharing of positive-. negative-and zero-sequence currents. and is the first example of zero-sequence current sharing in the literature. The controllers are designed in the stationary frame. The control structure consists of four loops:(1) the current controller;(2) the voltage controller;(3) the droop controller and the (4) negative and zero sequence current controllers. The output current is considered unknown for the controller and is added to the control system as a disturbance. The proposed controller features a high gain in fundamental and harmonic frequencies. hence a good voltage quality is obtained in the presence of unbalanced and nonlinear loads. To this aim. a proportional-resonant (PR) controller is adopted as the current controller. By using a multi-resonant controller as current controller. a unified control structure is obtained which is suitable for both grid-connected and islanded modes. The voltage controller is designed using a resonant controller so that the voltage can have low VUF and THD in the presence of unbalanced and nonlinear loads. Furthermore. in this paper. the droop method is applied to the control structure to share real and reactive powers. Simulation studies show that the conventional droop method cannot share the oscillatory part of the output power that is due to the presence of unbalanced loads in the microgrid. This paper relies on using zero and negative sequence virtual impedance controller to share the oscillatory part of output power.

University of Hawaii at Manoa,On a levelized-cost basis. solar and wind power generation are now competitive with fossil fuels. and still falling. But supply of these renewable resources is variable and intermittent. unlike traditional power plants. As a result. the cost of using flat retail pricing instead of dynamic. marginal-cost pricing--long advocated by economists--will grow. We evaluate the potential gains from dynamic pricing in high-renewable systems using a novel model of power supply and demand in Hawai'i. The model breaks new ground in integrating investment in generation and storage capacity with chronological operation of the system. including an account of reserves. a demand system with different interhour elasticities for different uses. and substitution between power and other goods and services. The model is open source and fully adaptable to other settings. Consistent with earlier studies. we find that dynamic pricing provides little social benefit in fossil-fuel-dominated power systems. only 2.6 to 4.6 percent of baseline annual expenditure. But dynamic pricing leads to a much greater social benefit of 8.5 to 23.4 percent in a 100 percent renewable power system with otherwise similar assumptions. High renewable systems. including 100 percent renewable. are remarkably affordable. The welfare maximizing (unconstrained) generation portfolio under the utility's projected 2045 technology and pessimistic interhour demand flexibility uses 79 percent renewable energy. without even accounting for pollution externalities.

Since wind and solar power are intermittent. system operators must predict renewable generation and allocate operating reserves to mitigate imbalances. If they overestimate the renewable generation during scheduling. insufficient generation will be available during operation. which can be very costly. However. if they underestimate the renewable generation. usually they will only face the cost of keeping some generation capacity online and idle. Therefore overestimation of renewable generation resources usually presents a more serious problem than underestimation.

This algorithm. Cost-Comfort Particle Swarm Optimization (CCPSO). is the first to combine a realistic. smooth representation of occupants’ willingness to pay for thermal comfort with a bottom-up. nonlinear model of the building and air conditioning system under control. We find that using a quadratic preference function for temperature can yield solutions that are both more comfortable and lower-cost than previous work that used a “brick wall” preference function with no preference for further cooling within an allowed temperature band and infinite aversion to going outside the allowed band. Using historical pricing data for a summer month in Chicago. CCPSO provided a 1% reduction in costs vs. a similar “brick-wall” MPC approach with the same comfort and 6–11% reduction in costs vs. other control strategies in the literature. CCPSO can also be used to operate the building with much greater comfort and costs or much lower costs and comfort than the “brick-wall” approach. depending on user preferences. CCPSO also reduced peak-hours demand by 3% vs. the “brick-wall” strategy and 4–14% vs. other strategies. At the same time. the CCPSO strategy increased off-peak energy consumption by 15% or more vs. other control methods. This may be valuable for power systems integrating large amounts of renewable power. which can otherwise become uneconomic due to saturation of demand during off-peak hours.

SL,Greater distributed production of energy from renewable resources such as solar radiation has increased fluctuations of power on the electrical grid. Current infrastructure has limited ability to handle continued increases in fluctuations. Predicting weather patterns in areas containing a high penetration of solar photovoltaic installations can allow time to switch to energy storage and inform consumers to conserve energy thereby mitigating such fluctuations. Accurate prediction requires data at a high spatial and temporal resolution in hard-to-access areas such as on the rooftops of commercial and government buildings. A low-cost. autonomous. and easily maintained meteorological sensor network can meet these requirements. Through rapid prototyping techniques. specifically in-house 3D printing and open-source technologies. sensor modules are reported that achieve a high degree of durability under direct sunlight and high thermal loads while accurately measuring parameters such as temperature. pressure. humidity. and solar irradiance. The modules are inexpensive. portable. and self-powered.

However. because of their intermittent nature. achieving a stable system in spite of the fluctuations of generation and demand is very difficult. Aiming to increase the stability margin of AC islanded microgrids comprising nondeterministic resources. properly share real power (P). and keep the network frequency ( at nominal value. this study exploits the presence of energy storage units (ESUs) along with a load-shedding scheme. To this end. this study proposes a multitier decentralized control strategy that is based on frequency and includes three control schemes. distributed generation unit (DGU) control. ESU control. and local loads control (LLC). These controllers operate simultaneously. The DGU controller shares the loads among DGUs in accordance with the frequency droop method. On the other hand. the ESU controller controls the production of ESUs and also the LLCs manage the loads and dump-load of the microgrid.

We apply state aggregation to reduce the effective size of the state space and utilize density estimation to obtain an algorithm that is robust to modeling changes in the cost function. We then use approximate policy iteration to obtain an asymptotically optimal solution to the problem when hot water demand is assumed to be independent of previous demand. We also provide heuristics for solving the problem when the demand is not assumed to be independent of its history. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms. we model the thermodynamics of a 20 gal water heater and simulate hot water demand for a typical two-person household.

1205067,Online solar radiation forecasting under asymmetrie cost functions,2014,Seyyed A Fatemi and Anthony Kuh and Matthias Fripp,,,,1-6,IEEE,Grid operators are tasked to balance the electric grid such that generation equals load. In recent years renewable energy sources have become more popular. Because wind and solar power are intermittent. system operators must predict renewable generation and allocate some operating reserves to mitigate errors. If they overestimate the renewable generation during scheduling. they do not have enough generation available during operation. which can be very costly. On the other hand. if they underestimate the renewable generation. they face only the cost of keeping some generation capacity online and idle. So overestimation of resources create a more serious problem than underestimation. However. many researchers who study the solar radiation forecasting problem evaluate their methods using symmetric criteria like root mean square error (RMSE) or mean absolute error (MAE).

The direct emissions of greenhouse gases produced when these generators burn fuel are fairly well understood. but less attention has been given to emissions during the other stages of the life‐cycle of these plants–building the plants. mining or drilling for fuel. operating the plants. etc.Emissions from these other stages of the life‐cycle become increasingly important if we contemplate the use of carbon capture and sequestration systems for coal and gas plants. These systems could capture and sequester around 90 percent of the direct emissions from new coal and gas plants. However. they do not reduce emissions from other stages of the life‐cycle. On the contrary. as additional industrial processes carbon capture systems introduce life‐cycle emissions of their own. and since they increase the amount of energy needed to generate each kilowatt‐hour (kWh) of electricity. they also increase the emissions at other stages of the fuel cycle for electricity.,True,SUKyrpIAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,3,https://www.academia.edu/download/6216155/Fripp_-_Electricity_Life_Cycle_Analysis.pdf,5206528503811112172,/scholar?cites=5206528503811112172,,https://www.academia.edu/download/6216155/Fripp_-_Electricity_Life_Cycle_Analysis.pdf,0,0,0

Four key elements are found to be critical for the State to achieve its 2050 goal of 80 percent greenhouse (GHG) reductions from the 1990 level: aggressive energy efficiency; clean electricity; widespread electrification of passenger vehicles. building heating. and industry heating; and large-scale production of low-carbon footprint biofuels to largely replace petroleum-based liquid fuels. The approach taken here is that technically achievable energy efficiency measures are assumed to be achieved by 2050 and aggregated with the other key elements mentioned above to estimate resultant emissions in 2050. The energy and non-energy sectors are each assumed to             havethe objective of meeting an 80 percent reduction from their respective 1990 GHG levels for the purposes of analysis. A different partitioning of energy and non-energy sector GHG greenhouse reductions is allowed if emission reductions in one sector are more economic or technically achievable than in the other.

Further. in a carbon-constrained world. both biomass producers and electricity generators will have competing claims concerning monetization of their low-carbon attributes. Sectoral accounting is further complicated by the timing of emissions in the biomass electricity lifecycle. Power generation releases CO2 that was previously sequestered—and an implicit assumption made by Sanchez et. al. is that harvested biomass provides room for re-growth and sequestering of released emissions. This assumption. however. raises two problems. First. if regrowth does not occur. net emissions will increase. even if CCS confines the majority of emissions.

Reputation is a primary currency of life on the street. and the problem of establishing. building. and maintaining reputation. or “street cred”. is a core concern of gangs and gang members [1. 12. 23].

While the estimates show promise for a variety of applications. the nonlinearity of the regularization leads to computational challenges. especially in multidimensions.

Incorporating the spatial data can inform the valid region for the density. When modelling very few events. additional priors can help to correctly fill in the gaps.

The law is demonstrated by counting the number of incidents in each of N spatial areas (street segments or grid cells) and then computing a parameter based on the counts. such as a point estimate on the Lorenz curve or the Gini index. Here we show that estimators commonly used in the literature for these statistics are biased when the number of incidents is low (several thousand or less).

We used a Poisson mixture model to analyze the decline of malaria at the county level in Alabama (an archetypical Deep South cotton state) during the 1930s. Employing a novel data set. we argue that. contrary to a leading theory. the decline of malaria in the American South was not caused by population movement away from malarial areas or the decline of Southern tenant farming. We elaborate and provide evidence for an alternate explanation that emphasizes the role of targeted New Deal–era public health interventions and the development of local-level public health infrastructure.

Combustion instabilities near the lean limit can be addressed by partially stratifying the in-cylinder charge. The Partially Stratified Charge (PSC) approach involves micro-direct-injection of pure fuel. or a fuel-air mixture. to create a rich zone in the region of the spark-plug. This has been demonstrated to improve combustion in an ultra-lean bulk mixture. An experimental premixing apparatus was devised to investigate the effect of changing the stoichiometry of the micro-direct-injected charge. In conjunction. a numerical methodology was used as an aid to understanding the complex in-cylinder processes.

The main target is the fully exploitation of the potential of renewable fuels. To this aim. the coupling a biomass reformer together with a high temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack shows some advantages for the similar operating temperature of the two processes and the internal reforming capability of the SOFC. The latter further allows less stringent composition requirements of the feed gas from a gasifier and internal cooling of the SOFC.In this work. a complete model of a SOFC coupled with a biomass gasifier is used to identify the main effects of the operating conditions on the fuel cell performance.The gasification process has been simulated by an equilibrium model able to compute the reformate composition under different operating conditions. whereas a 3D fluid dynamics simulation (FLUENT …,True,tuFUfpwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,87,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431106003632,2899780316921543430,/scholar?cites=2899780316921543430,,,0,0,0

Combustion instabilities near the lean limit can be addressed by partially stratifying the in-cylinder charge. The Partially Stratified Charge (PSC) approach involves micro-direct-injection of pure fuel. or a fuel-air mixture. to create a rich zone in the region of the spark-plug. This has been demonstrated to improve combustion in an ultra-lean bulk mixture. An experimental premixing apparatus was devised to investigate the effect of changing the stoichiometry of the micro-direct-injected charge. In conjunction. a numerical methodology was used as an aid to understanding the complex in-cylinder processes.

Indeed this key vehicle parameter affects the vehicle autonomy and its evolution may be enhanced by a proper match with further “external” variables. such as the availability of recharge stations and their characteristic speed for battery recharging.In this paper we propose an easily implementable control strategy. that is intrinsically robust with respect to the variation of used SOC over a trip and is based only on a preliminary knowledge of the target distance. Its use is experimentally demonstrated on a prototype PHEV to accomplish a defined target SOC at the end of the trip.

The process accounts for all the steps and equipment necessary to convert raw moist biomass into dry and pelletized hydrochar. By means of mass and thermal balances and based on common equations specific to the various equipment. thermal energy and power consumption were calculated at variable process conditions: HTC reactor temperature T: 180. 220. 250 C; reaction time θ: 1. 3. 8 h. When operating the HTC plant with grape marc (65% moisture content) at optimized process conditions (T= 220 C; θ= 1 h; dry biomass to water ratio= 0.19). thermal energy and power consumption were equal to 1170 kWh and 160 kWh per ton of hydrochar produced. respectively. Correspondingly. plant efficiency was 78%. In addition. the techno-economical aspects of the HTC process were analyzed in detail. considering both investment and production costs. The production cost of pelletized hydrochar and its break-even point were determined to be 157€/ton and 200€/ton. respectively.

1205278,Hydrothermal carbonization of biomass: design of a batch reactor and preliminary experimental results,2014,Luca Fiori and Daniele Basso and Daniele Castello and Marco Baratieri,37,Chemical Engineering Transactions,,55-60,,The interest aroused by HTC stems from the fact that it represents an effective alternative to the common treatments for wet biomass. ie composting and anaerobic digestion. In fact. if compared to these conventional processes. HTC has several advantages: it is faster. it is not affected by inhibiting or toxic substances and. finally. the process produces a solid fraction exploitable in different fields: energy production. soil improvement. raw material for high added value applications. Thus. a batch reactor (Vreactor: 50 mL; Pdesign: 140 bar; Tdesign: 300 C) was designed and constructed to investigate the HTC process. At first. the scheme of the equipment (P&I) and its main characteristics are detailed. Then. preliminary experimental tests and relevant analyses are addressed. HTC experimental runs were performed with two different substrates: a model mixture of water and sugar and a mixture of water and grape seeds. which represent a by-product of the wine-making industry. For the first time in the literature. HTC data on these two kinds of substrates are reported. The substrates and the hydrochar were analyzed (chemical and thermal characterization). Preliminary data on the effect of process conditions (temperature and residence time) on process yields (kghydrochar/kgdry feed) and on hydrochar carbon content (kgcarbon/kghydrochar) were obtained.

With this purpose. a laboratory scale fixed bed reactor (FBR) was adapted from the standard Gray-King (GK) assay test on coal to conduct fixed bed pyrolysis experiments on agricultural and agro-industrial by-products. The present study provides results on the pyrolysis of two types of biomass: chipped olive tree trimmings (OT) and olive pomace (OP). Solid (char) and liquid (tar) product yields are reported. Mass yields are determined and compared with values obtained in similar works. Results indicate that char yield decreases from 49%(OT-db) and 50%(OP-db) at 325 C to 26%(OT db) and 30%(OP-db) at 650 C. Tar yield is almost constant (42%) at different reaction temperatures for OT. while it decreases slightly from 42% to 35% for OP.

However. the lower heating value and higher reactivity (at lower temperatures) of raw biomass can result in fuel segregation in boilers. causing burnout at lower temperatures. lower steam generation efficiency and fouling. In addition. the relatively high water content of some biomasses requires extensive drying prior to combustion. These issues may be addressed by hydrothermally carbonizing moist biomasses to produce hydrochars that more closely resemble coal’s properties prior to co-firing. In the present work. we probe the co-oxidation behavior of a series of hydrothermally carbonized biomass samples over a range of hydrochar-coal blend ratios to determine the degree of carbonization necessary to reduce fuel segregation.

OT were hydrothermally carbonized for a residence time τ of up to 8 h at temperatures between 180 and 250 C to systematically investigate the chemical and energy properties changes of hydrochars during HTC. Additional experiments at 120 and 150 C at τ= 0 h were carried out to analyze the heat-up transient phase required to reach the HTC set-point temperature. Furthermore. an original HTC reaction kinetics model was developed. The HTC reaction pathway was described through a lumped model. in which biomass is converted into solid (distinguished between primary and secondary char). liquid. and gaseous products. The kinetics model. written in MATLAB TM. was used in best fitting routines with HTC experimental data obtained using OT and two other agro-wastes previously tested: grape marc and Opuntia Ficus Indica. The HTC kinetics model effectively predicts carbon distribution among HTC products versus time with the thermal transient phase included; it represents an effective tool for R&D in the HTC field.

Olive tree trimmings (OT) milled and sieved to 425-850 mm particle size range. was pyrolysed at peak temperatures between 200 and 325 C and hydrothermally carbonizated at peak temperatures between 120 and 250 C and biomass to water ratio 0.25. Residence time at peak temperature of 30 minutes and an inert atmosphere of N2 was used for both the thermal processes. The results of comparison. on the basis of fuel qualities of biochars obtained. showed that the hydrothermally prepared biochar had higher energy Densification while the torrefied biochar had higher energy yield due to higher mass yield.

Hydrochar finds application as bio-fuel. soil improver and for the production of carbon-advanced materials. In recent years. interest in HTC technology has grown significantly. in terms of both scientific research and industrial development. The HTC process consists of several reactions occurring both in series and in parallel: hydrolysis. dehydration. decarboxylation. condensation. aromatization. and others. Some reactions are known to be exothermic. while others are endothermic. Knowing the enthalpy of the “whole” HTC reaction would be beneficial in terms of both process design and energy calculations. in particular to evaluate the process heat duty. Unfortunately. such kind of information is barely available in the literature: some data have been obtained at the “micro-scale” using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). with the limits of using a few milligrams of (usually heterogeneous) biomass per trial. while punctual data at larger scale are actually missing. In order to fill this gap. we designed and constructed in-house a 2 L batch reactor equipped with four thermocouples-placed at different heights inside the reactor-and capable to withstand pressures up to 140 bar and temperatures up to 300 C. The reactor. controlled in temperature. is heated by four electrical resistances (1 kW each) and thermally insulated.

Since the thickness of the barrier film. separating the porous layer from the metal. does not change during the steady-state growth of an anodic porous layer. the rate of displacement of the metal-oxide interface to the metal direction must be equal to the rate of displacement of the pore base to the oxide direction. As a consequence. porosity can be expressed in terms of the ratio i diss/i ion. where i diss is the dissolution current density at the pore base. and i ion is the ionic current density at the metal-oxide interface.

In reactions aimed to obtain gases destined to engines for the production of electrical energy. such as in downdraft gasification. pyrolysis occurs right above the gasification sections and tars are undesired products. which need to be cracked. Whilst systems to efficiently crack tars in gasification set-ups are required (Monteiro Nunes et al.. 2008). tar cracking is often complex and this hampers the widespread diffusion of small scale gasification systems. However. downdraft gasification is considered one of the potentially most economically viable process to produce decentralized electricity generation in small scale applications (Ahrenfeldt et al.. 2013 and Biagini et al.. 2014).,True,yiVMCvEAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,14,https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/32645/Volpe%20Catalytic%20Effect%20of%20Char%202016%20Published.pdf?sequence=1,5347711339681984973,/scholar?cites=5347711339681984973,,https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/32645/Volpe%20Catalytic%20Effect%20of%20Char%202016%20Published.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Eng. Appl. Sci,,5-11,,The use of ligno-cellulosic residuals from agriculture as means for renewable energy production is well known; nonetheless significant problems still exist on development of bioenergy value chains. Moisture content and hygroscopicity are among these problems. Higher moisture content of the biomass means lower calorific value and higher perishability. hence storage difficulties. For this reason it is important to evaluate how the moisture content of the material varies while it is stored and how the calorific value of the feedstock is affected by it. The purpose of this study is to determine the variation of moisture content and its influence on lower calorific value (LCV) of four types of solid residual biomass: oven dried chipped olive tree trimmings. milled olive pomace; oven dried olive tree trimmings and fresh olive tree trimmings. Moisture content of the samples is calculated by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) according to standard CEN/TS 14774-2: 2004. while the LCVs are calculated by means of a calorimeter. following standard UNI EN 14918: 2010. All the biomass samples were left to reach equilibrium moisture content (EMC) in a temperature and humidity controlled environment. Two different phases were analyzed with respect to moisture uptake rates: 1) fast moisture uptake rate phase (first four hours of exposure) and 2) slow moisture uptake rate.(the days following the first four hours of exposure). Samples experiencing fast moisture uptake rate. during the first four hours of exposure. were kept in a monitored ambient at T= 22±1 C and RH= 59±2%. while samples exposed to slow moisture uptake rate were kept in a climatic chamber …,True,yiVMCvEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,11,https://iris.unipa.it/retrieve/handle/10447/98204/128509/evaluation%20of%20equilibrium%20moisture.pdf,2405757845569874393,/scholar?cites=2405757845569874393,,https://iris.unipa.it/retrieve/handle/10447/98204/128509/evaluation%20of%20equilibrium%20moisture.pdf,0,0,0

In particular. palladium-based membranes have been the subject of many studies. due to their potential use as hydrogen-selective membranes for gas separation or purification [1. 2]. Owing to the high cost of palladium and in order to increase the flow rate of hydrogen. composite membranes. formed by a thin layer of palladium deposited on a porous support. are largely preferred to thick self-standing metal membranes. Different supports were extensively used to prepare composite membranes resistant to the high temperature required for fast gas permeation through a dense palladium layer. A severe drawback in using composite membranes is due to the possible presence in the palladium layer of pinholes and/or cracks. which reduce the selectivity.A previous work [3]. dealing with the electroless deposition of Pd on anodic alumina membranes. showed that an accurate control of bath composition and deposition procedure was necessary in order to avoid damaging of the membrane. In the present work. we present some results relative to a modified procedure of electroless deposition giving a thin and compact palladium layer on alumina membranes. These membranes were prepared in phosphoric acid solutions and the morphological parameters were found to match well a model [4] based on a possible mechanism of growth of the porous layer [5].,True,yiVMCvEAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,11,https://www.academia.edu/download/45883362/Developing_a_procedure_to_optimize_elect20160523-9746-1j92scs.pdf,897269505584931406,/scholar?cites=897269505584931406,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45883362/Developing_a_procedure_to_optimize_elect20160523-9746-1j92scs.pdf,0,0,0

Due to the cost and complexity of developing such extensive tables. industry sectors are generally represented at a rather aggregate level. Currently. one of the most important applications of input–output analysis is environmental assessments. for which highly aggregate sectors may not be sufficient to yield accurate results. We experiment with four of the most important global MRIO systems available. analyzing the sensitivity of a set of aggregate CO2 multipliers to aggregations in the MRIO tables used to calculate them. Across databases. we find (a) significant sensitivity to background system detail and (b) that sub-sectors contained within the same aggregate MRIO sector may exhibit highly different carbon multipliers.

We outline a decomposition methodology for investigating the variations that exist when using different multiregional input–output (MRIO) systems to calculate a region's consumption-based account. Structural decomposition analysis attributes the change in emissions to a set of dependent determinants. such as technical coefficients. the Leontief inverse and final demands. We apply our methodology to three MRIO databases – Eora. GTAP and WIOD. Findings reveal that the variation between Eora and GTAP can be attributed to differences in the Leontief inverse and emissions’ data. whereas the variation between Eora and WIOD is due to differences in final demand and the Leontief inverse.

This paper presents a detailed time series of embodied GHG emissions from the construction sector for 1997–2011. This data is used to demonstrate that strategies which focus solely on improving operational performance of buildings and the production efficiencies of domestic material producers will be insufficient to meet sector emission reduction targets. Reductions in the order of 80% will require a substantial decline in the use of materials with carbon-intensive supply chains.

However. harder-to-reach fossil fuels require more energy to extract and. hence. are coming at an increasing ‘energy cost’. Associated declines in fossil fuel energy-return-on-investment ratios at first appear of little concern. given that published estimates for oil. coal and gas are typically above 25: 1. However. such ratios are measured at the primary energy stage and should instead be estimated at the final stage where energy enters the economy (for example. electricity and petrol). Here. we calculate global time series (1995–2011) energy-return-on-investment ratios for fossil fuels at both primary and final energy stages. We concur with common primary-stage estimates (~ 30: 1). but find very low ratios at the final stage: around 6: 1 and declining.

This paper takes the UK as a case study and calculates energy. water and food consumption-based accounts for 1997–2013. Policies. designed to reduce the environmental impact of consumption of products. can intervene at many stages in a product’s whole life-time from ‘cradle to gate’. We use input-output analysis techniques to investigate the interaction between the energy. water and food impacts of products at different points along their supply chains. from the extraction of material and burning of energy. to the point of final consumption.

Results feature in climate policy discussion on emissions reduction responsibilities; yet studies show that outcomes produced by each database differ. This paper compares the emissions associated with value chains from Eora. EXIOBASE. GTAP and WIOD. Structural path analysis identifies the largest paths in each database and the differences in common paths are calculated. For the top 100 value chain paths that contain the largest difference. structural path decomposition is used to identify the contribution each part of the value chain makes towards the difference. The results identify and quantify key flows that are the cause of difference in the databases.

Of particular interest is the examination of energy supply chains. given the associated risks from supply-chain issues. including availability shocks. taxes on fossil fuels and fluctuating energy prices. Using a multiregional IO (MRIO) database to calculate energy consumption-based accounts (CBA) allows analysts to both determine the quantity and source of energy embodied in products along the supply chain. However. it is recognised in the literature that there is uncertainty as to the most appropriate type of energy data that should be employed in an IO framework.

Detailed measures of this inequality are required to ensure an equitable and just energy transition. Here we calculate final energy footprints; that is. the energy embodied in goods and services across income classes in 86 countries. both highly industrialized and developing. We analyse the energy intensity of goods and services used by different income groups. as well as their income elasticity of demand. We find that inequality in the distribution of energy footprints varies across different goods and services.

1205352,Techniques for Evaluating the Differences in Multiregional Input-Output Databases,2017,Anne Owen,,Cham: Springer International Publishing,,,,This chapter provides a brief overview of the current state of research in the field of multiregional input–output (MRIO) analysis and introduces the main MRIO databases. The chapter continues by explaining that due to differences in the way the databases were constructed and the source data used. there are differences in the CO2 consumption-based accounts calculated by each database.

We investigate the variation in results from three major MRIO databases by comparing underlying economic data and territorial and consumption-based results across databases.

However. in order to test these concerns on a national scale. there is a conceptual and methodological gap in relation to calculating a national-level EROI and analysing its policy implications. We address this by developing a novel application of an Input-Output methodology to calculate a national-level indirect energy investment. one of the components needed for calculating a national-level EROI. This is a mixed physical and monetary approach using Multi-Regional Input-Output data and an energy extension. We discuss some conceptual and methodological issues relating to defining EROI for a national economy. and describe in detail the methodology and data requirements for the approach. We obtain initial results for the UK for the period 1997–2012. which show that the country’s EROI has been declining since the beginning of the 21st Century.

This is surprising: China is the world’s largest energy consumer. whilst exergy analysis provides a robust thermodynamic framework for analysing the technical efficiency of energy use. In response. we develop three novel sub-analyses. First we perform a long-term whole economy time-series exergy analysis for China (1971–2010). We find a 10-fold growth in China’s useful work since 1971. which is supplied by a 4-fold increase in primary energy coupled to a 2.5-fold gain in aggregate exergy conversion efficiency to useful work: from 5% to 12.5%.

Stanley Jevons introduced the concept of energy rebound: that anticipated energy efficiency savings may be “taken back” by behavioural responses. This is an important issue today because. if energy rebound is significant. this would hamper the effectiveness of energy efficiency policies aimed at reducing energy use and associated carbon emissions. However. empirical studies which estimate national energy rebound are rare and. perhaps as a result. rebound is largely ignored in energy-economy models and associated policy. A significant difficulty lies in the components of energy rebound assessed in empirical studies: most examine direct and indirect rebound in the static economy. excluding potentially significant rebound of the longer term structural response of the national economy. In response. we develop a novel exergy-based approach to estimate national energy rebound for the UK and US (1980–2010) and China (1981–2010). Exergy—as “available energy”—allows a consistent. thermodynamic-based metric for national-level energy efficiency. We find large energy rebound in China. suggesting that improvements in China’s energy efficiency may be associated with increased energy consumption (“backfire”). Conversely. we find much lower (partial) energy rebound for the case of the UK and US. These findings support the hypothesis that producer-sided economies (such as China) may exhibit large energy rebound. reducing the effectiveness of energy efficiency. unless other policy measures (eg. carbon taxes) are implemented.

Firstly. it investigates to what extent changes in thermodynamic efficiency have contributed to overall changes in sectoral energy intensities. Secondly. it analyses how much of the structural change in the UK economy is driven by the offshoring of energy-intensive production overseas.

We identify a theory-to-policy process involving APFs comprised of six steps:(1) selecting a theoretical energy-economy framework;(2) formulating modeling approaches;(3) econometrically fitting an APF to historical economic and energy data;(4) comparing and evaluating modeling approaches;(5) interpreting the economy; and (6) formulating energy and economic policy. We find that choices made in Steps 1–4 can lead to very different interpretations of the economy (Step 5) and policies (Step 6). To investigate these effects. we use empirical data (Portugal and UK) and the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) APF to evaluate four modeling choices:(a) rejecting (or not) the cost-share principle;(b) including (or not) energy;(c) quality-adjusting (or not) factors of production; and (d) CES nesting structure. Thereafter. we discuss two revealing examples for which different upstream modeling choices lead to very different policies. In the first example. the (kl) e nesting structure implies significant investment in energy. while other nesting structures suggest otherwise. In the second example. unadjusted factors of production suggest balanced investment in labor and energy. while quality-adjusting suggests significant investment in labor over energy. Divergent outcomes provide cautionary tales for policymakers: greater understanding of upstream modeling choices and their downstream implications is needed.

1205369,Thermodynamic Efficiency Gains and their Role as a Key ‘Engine of Economic Growth’,2019,Marco Sakai and Paul E Brockway and John R Barrett and Peter G Taylor,12,Energies,1,1-14,MDPI. Open Access Journal,Increasing energy efficiency is commonly viewed as providing a key stimulus to economic growth. through investment in efficient technologies. reducing energy use and costs. enabling productivity gains. and generating jobs. However. this view is received wisdom. as empirical validation has remained elusive. A central problem is that current energy-economy models are not thermodynamically consistent. since they do not include the transformation of energy in physical terms from primary to end-use stages. In response. we develop the UK MAcroeconometric Resource COnsumption (MARCO-UK) model. the first econometric economy-wide model to explicitly include thermodynamic efficiency and end energy use (energy services). We find gains in thermodynamic efficiency are a key ‘engine of economic growth’. contributing 25% of the increases to gross domestic product (GDP) in the UK over the period of 1971–2013. This confirms an underrecognised role for energy in enabling economic growth. We attribute most of the thermodynamic efficiency gains to endogenised technical change. We also provide new insights into how the ‘efficiency-led growth engine’mechanism works in the whole economy. Our results imply a slowdown in thermodynamic efficiency gains will constrain economic growth. whilst future energy-GDP decoupling will be harder to achieve than we suppose. This confirms the imperative for economic models to become thermodynamically consistent.

However. the collation and guidance as to the specification and estimation choices involved with such energy-extended CES functions is disparate.

1205371,Meeting 2030 primary energy and economic growth goals: Mission impossible?,2019,Matthew Kuperus Heun and Paul E Brockway,251,Applied Energy,,112697,Elsevier,To meet climate change mitigation objectives. international institutions have adopted targets aimed at reducing or ending growth of primary energy consumption. Simultaneously. continued economic growth is forecasted to meet human development goals. Together. declining energy consumption and rising gross domestic product (GDP) is called “absolute decoupling.” However. absolute decoupling is unprecedented for the world economy as a whole (since at least 1971). Is absolute decoupling “Mission impossible?” Given the high stakes. we need a clearer understanding of the extent of future energy–GDP decoupling. To gain that understanding. we perform societal exergy analyses using a novel Physical Supply Use Table framework to assess historical and future trends of primary energy consumption and economic growth for one medium human development index country and one very high human …,True,MVtq61AAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,22,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261919302831,18013651506393429943,/scholar?cites=18013651506393429943,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261919302831,0,0,0

Currently. little is known about factors which have driven regional air-conditioning (AC) energy consumption over time. since the literature is limited to cross-sectional studies that lack differentiation between climatic and non-climatic influences. Future projections for the EU's electricity sector may therefore neglect the potential implications of rapidly growing AC demand.

1205381,Carbon measurement in the NHS: Calculating the first consumption-based total carbon footprint of an NHS Trust.,2009,Paul Brockway,,,,,,In January 2009 a national NHS England carbon reduction strategy (SDU. 2009a) was launched. It is believed to be the first public sector organisation worldwide to publish a carbon strategy based on the embedded emissions of all its activities: a consumption-based approach. The strategy sets a target for 2015 to reduce NHS England’s total consumption-based emissions from travel. building energy and procurement sectors to 10% below the 2007 level of 20.0MtCO2 (SEI and Arup. 2009a).   At the local level. NHS Trusts currently measure building energy emissions and in some cases staff travel emissions. but do not include procurement. This omission is important. as procurement is estimated to account for 60% of NHS England emissions. Therefore. as none of the NHS Trusts in England have undertaken a consumption-based footprint. they have no means of baselining all emissions and checking individual progress towards the national target. A gap therefore exists between NHS England targets and the measurement tools available at an NHS Trust level.   This research seeks to explore this gap. Firstly. the consumption-based carbon footprint of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was calculated. and determined to be 168.902tCO2 in 2007. A similar methodology was used to that developed for the NHS England carbon footprint study (SDC. 2008). except importantly bottom-up data was obtained directly from the NHS Trust. By reviewing the results. and comparing them to those for NHS England. the footprinting technique appears technically viable for use at an NHS Trust level.

Honduras. like many low and medium Human Development Index countries. depends on primary solid biofuels for more than 30% of its primary energy supply (as of 2013). We conducted a societal exergy analysis and developed a forest stock model for Honduras for 1971–2013 and used the results to model an energy transition from traditional wood stoves to either improved efficiency wood cookstoves or modern fuel cookstoves (using Electricity or Liquefied petroleum gas) over the period 2013–2050. The exergy analysis and forest model enabled quantification of the environmental tradeoffs between the improved efficiency and fuel switching scenarios. We find that the continued reliance on wood within both the existing and improved wood cookstove scenarios would exhaust forest stocks by 2050. though improved efficiency could reduce national greenhouse gas emissions. Modern fuel cookstoves would reduce household air pollution. emissions. and deforestation. However. the best alternative to successfully reduce household air pollution.

Over the next decades the increase in rural population in many developing countries will be overshadowed by population flows to cities. Rural populations globally are expected to peak at a level of 3.5 billion people by around 2020 and decline thereafter. albeit with heterogeneous regional trends. This adds urgency in addressing rural energy access. but our common future will be predominantly urban. Most of urban growth will continue to occur in small-to medium-sized urban centers. Growth in these smaller cities poses serious policy challenges. especially in the developing world. In small cities. data and information to guide policy are largely absent. local resources to tackle development challenges are limited. and governance and institutional capacities are weak. requiring serious efforts in capacity building. novel applications of remote sensing. information. and decision support techniques. and new institutional partnerships.

In this study. we examine the resource dependency of economic activities over the past several decades for a set of countries comprising developing. emerging and mature industrialized economies. Rather than a single universal industrial development pathway. we find a diversity of economic dependencies on material use. made evident through cluster analysis. We conduct tests for relative and absolute decoupling of the economy from material use. and compare these with similar tests for decoupling from carbon emissions. both for single countries and country groupings using panel analysis. We show that. over the longer term. emerging and developing countries tend to have significantly larger material-economic coupling than mature industrialized economies (although this effect may be enhanced by trade patterns). but that the contrary is true for short-term coupling. Moreover. we demonstrate that absolute dematerialization limits economic growth rates. while the successful industrialization of developing countries inevitably requires a strong material component. Alternative development priorities are thus urgently needed both for mature and emerging economies: reducing absolute consumption levels for the former. and avoiding the trap of resource-intensive economic and human development for the latter.,True,c8Ar3N4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,136,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070385,17430004853049113104,/scholar?cites=17430004853049113104,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070385,0,0,0

Energy systems are the main source of greenhouse gas emissions. and the services provided by energy (such as heating. power. transport and lighting) are vital to support human development. To address this challenge. we advocate for a eudaimonic need-centred understanding of human well-being. as opposed to hedonic subjective views of well-being.

The potential disruption in supply of critical materials could endanger such a transition to low-carbon infrastructure and. by extension. compromise energy security more broadly because low carbon technologies are reliant on these materials in a way that fossil-fuelled energy infrastructure is not. Criticality is currently defined as the combination of the potential for supply disruption and the exposure of a system of interest to that disruption. We build on this definition and develop a dynamic approach to quantifying criticality. which monitors the change in criticality during the transition towards a low-carbon infrastructure goal.

This paper presents a detailed time series of embodied GHG emissions from the construction sector for 1997–2011.

1205412,Indicators for industrial energy efficiency in India,2009,Dolf Gielen and Peter Taylor,34,Energy,8,962-969,Pergamon,India accounts for 4.5% of industrial energy use worldwide. This share is projected to increase as the economy expands rapidly. The level of industrial energy efficiency in India varies widely. Certain sectors. such as cement. are relatively efficient. while others. such as pulp and paper. are relatively inefficient. Future energy efficiency efforts should focus on direct reduced iron. pulp and paper and small-scale cement kilns because the potentials for improvement are important in both percentage and absolute terms. Under business as usual. industrial energy use is projected to rise faster than total final energy use. A strong focus on energy efficiency can reduce this growth. but CO2 emissions will still rise substantially. If more substantial CO2 emissions reductions are to be achieved then energy efficiency will need to be combined with measures that reduce the carbon intensity of the industrial fuel mix.,True,fg1AcQkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,103,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544208003095,8363617832330242279,/scholar?cites=8363617832330242279,,,0,0,0

MARKAL modelling has a long history helping underpin government energy and climate policy. We trace the use of the model from its initial development in the mid-1970s to the present day. highlighting attributes that contribute to its role as a successful ‘boundary object’ for different but interconnecting energy policy communities. We suggest that changing images of the energy policy problem have enabled MARKAL to shift from an initial role in identifying technologies to reduce oil dependency to playing a key role in target-oriented climate policy.

Strategic niche management is an approach to catalysing a transition to a new regime using protected ‘niche’ spaces to enable development and experimentation with an innovation. Intermediary actors play an important role in establishing these niches as they facilitate knowledge sharing and build the wider networks and systems needed to support an innovation.The influence of intermediaries within socio-technical transitions and strategic niche management is still an under-researched area.

One of these additional benefits is deferral of distribution infrastructure reinforcement. allowing increased load growth. This paper considers the potential of electricity storage for peak shaving on distribution networks. focusing on residential areas. A demand model is used to synthesise high resolution domestic load profiles. and these are used within Monte Carlo analysis to determine how much peak shaving could be achieved with storage. An efficient method of finding the potential peak shaving using electricity storage is developed for this purpose.

Firstly. it investigates to what extent changes in thermodynamic efficiency have contributed to overall changes in sectoral energy intensities. Secondly. it analyses how much of the structural change in the UK economy is driven by the offshoring of energy-intensive production overseas.

It was hoped that this competition would result in the generators offering their plants to the pool at marginal cost. thus leading to lower electricity prices. This paper uses game theory to see whether it is likely that generators will bid in their plant at marginal cost or whether it is possible and profitable for them to offer higher prices. It is found that in a market without contracts. bids higher than marginal cost would be likely under certain circumstances.

However. in order to test these concerns on a national scale. there is a conceptual and methodological gap in relation to calculating a national-level EROI and analysing its policy implications. We address this by developing a novel application of an Input-Output methodology to calculate a national-level indirect energy investment. one of the components needed for calculating a national-level EROI. This is a mixed physical and monetary approach using Multi-Regional Input-Output data and an energy extension. We discuss some conceptual and methodological issues relating to defining EROI for a national economy. and describe in detail the methodology and data requirements for the approach. We obtain initial results for the UK for the period 1997–2012. which show that the country’s EROI has been declining since the beginning of the 21st Century.

1205433,Thermodynamic Efficiency Gains and their Role as a Key ‘Engine of Economic Growth’,2019,Marco Sakai and Paul Brockway and John Barrett and Peter Taylor,12,Energies,1,110,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Increasing energy efficiency is commonly viewed as providing a key stimulus to economic growth. through investment in efficient technologies. reducing energy use and costs. enabling productivity gains. and generating jobs. However. this view is received wisdom. as empirical validation has remained elusive. A central problem is that current energy-economy models are not thermodynamically consistent. since they do not include the transformation of energy in physical terms from primary to end-use stages. In response. we develop the UK MAcroeconometric Resource COnsumption (MARCO-UK) model. the first econometric economy-wide model to explicitly include thermodynamic efficiency and end energy use (energy services). We find gains in thermodynamic efficiency are a key ‘engine of economic growth’. contributing 25% of the increases to gross domestic product (GDP) in the UK over the period of 1971–2013. This confirms an underrecognised role for energy in enabling economic growth. We attribute most of the thermodynamic efficiency gains to endogenised technical change. We also provide new insights into how the ‘efficiency-led growth engine’mechanism works in the whole economy. Our results imply a slowdown in thermodynamic efficiency gains will constrain economic growth. whilst future energy-GDP decoupling will be harder to achieve than we suppose. This confirms the imperative for economic models to become thermodynamically consistent.

This paper analyses current innovation systems in the UK for a range of new and renewable energy technologies. and generates policy recommendations for improving the effectiveness of these innovation systems. Although incentives are in place in the UK to encourage innovation in these technologies. system failures—or ‘gaps’—are identified in moving technologies along the innovation chain. preventing their successful commercialisation. Sustained investment will be needed for these technologies to achieve their potential. It is argued that a stable and consistent policy framework is required to help create the conditions for this.

The challenge of moving to sustainable energy systems which provide secure. affordable and low-carbon energy services requires the application of methods which recognise the complexity of energy systems in relation to social. technological. economic and environmental aspects. Energy systems consist of many actors. interacting through networks. leading to emergent properties and adaptive and learning processes.

We argue that. although the importance of such infrastructure networks to sustainability and low carbon transitions in the energy. water and mobility sectors is clear. there is relatively little understanding of the social and institutional dimension of these systems and appropriate governance strategies for their transformation. This may be because the prevalent model of infrastructure governance in the energy and other sectors has prioritised short term time horizons and static efficiencies.

In contrast. the revenue of the incumbent Energy Utility Company (EUCo) model is coupled with the sale of units of energy. which are predominantly sourced from fossil fuels.

1205455,The greening of innovation systems for eco-innovation–towards an evolutionary climate mitigation policy,2009,Timothy Foxon and Maj Munch Andersen,,"DRUID Summer Conference-Innovation, Strategy and Knowledge",,,,Policies for mitigating climate change have never received as much attention worldwide as now. At the same time another upcoming policy trend is the increasing synthesis between innovation-and environmental policy. a synthesis that is captured by the eco-innovation concept. However. the climate and innovation policy areas are currently little aligned and have in fact been considered opposites until very recently. The paper seeks to identify how evolutionary economic theory. hitherto very little applied to the environmental area. may guide the development of climate policies and eco-innovation policies in important ways. The paper argues that the evolutionary economic perspective entails a new policy rationale which not only puts more emphasis on greening of markets as a means towards reaching climate goals but also shifts the representation of the economy towards a more dynamic one. The policy implications of this shift are considerable and have hitherto gained little attention.A deeper understanding of eco-innovation dynamics is strongly needed for informing both climate and innovation policies. The paper argues that the fact that environmental problems have largely been neglected by evolutionary economic research illustrates a lack of genuine systems thinking within this line of thought. despite the prominence of systems ideas. The paper proposes a strong paradigmatic explanation of eco-innovation based on a combination of innovation systems thinking and an evolutionary capabilities approach.,True,0OA4hTkAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,93,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/43251692.pdf,15713460946896528129,/scholar?cites=15713460946896528129,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/43251692.pdf,0,0,0
1205456,Towards a new complexity economics for sustainability,2013,Timothy J Foxon and Jonathan Köhler and Jonathan Michie and Christine Oughton,37,Cambridge journal of economics,1,187-208,Oxford University Press,Some of the most important and urgent topics requiring economic analysis and policy advice are the problems of climate change and environmental sustainability. and what can be done to alter corporate and individual behaviour to deal with these issues. Neoclassical economists tend to focus on market solutions such as carbon trading. drawing on ideas of perfect rationality of actors and the appropriateness of ‘marginal’ analysis. To link such policies to the whole range of potential actions. from legislative and regulatory to changing individual behaviours. requires the economy and society to be analysed in its full complexity. recognising that ‘marginal’ analysis can be not just irrelevant but positively harmful when the need is for systemic shifts in economic and social trajectories.

Recent work has characterised the costs and benefits of individual “smart” investments. The political economy of the UK electricity system. however. has co-evolved such that there is a mismatch between where benefits accrue and where costs are incurred. leading to a problem of value capture and redeployment. Further. some benefits of smart grids are less easy to price directly and can be classified as public goods. such as energy security and decarbonisation.

The key points identified in the survey are that the EF (a) is seen as a strong communication tool.(b) has a limited role within a policy context.(c) is limited in scope.(d) should be closer aligned to the UN System of Environmental and Economic Accounting and (e) is most useful as part of a basket of indicators. Key issues from the review of methods are:(a) none of the major methods identified can address all relevant issues and questions at once.(b) basing bioproductivity calculations on Net Primary Production (NPP) is a promising approach.(c) advances in linking bioproductivity with ecosystem services and biodiversity have been made by the Dynamic EF concept and the HANPP indicator.(d) environmentally extended input-output analysis (IOA) provides a number of advantages for improving EF calculations and (e) further variations such as the emergy-based concept or the inclusion of further pollutants are not regarded as providing a fundamental shift to the usefulness of EF for policy making.

One of the basic tenets of sustainable development is having regard for future generations–ensuring adequate resources are left for their needs and that irresolvable environmental problems are avoided. One of the greatest challenges to the successful implementation of sustainable development is to change the present unsustainable trend in the consumption of resources and the associated production of waste. The first step towards meeting this challenge is to measure the rate of resource consumption and the amount of waste production by human activity and to assess their impacts on the environment’s capacity to provide the natural resources and assimilate the waste products.The aim of this study is to measure the ‘material flow’of resources such as minerals. metals. wood. food. water and fossil fuels (eg coal. oil and gas) that the residents of York consume individually and collectively and to determine the environmental impact of the City of York in terms of its ‘ecological footprint’. In calculating the ecological footprint of York it is possible to determine the amount of the land that York requires to provide it with natural resources in order to undertake certain activities and to absorb all the waste and emissions that are produced by the city.

We outline a decomposition methodology for investigating the variations that exist when using different multiregional input–output (MRIO) systems to calculate a region's consumption-based account. Structural decomposition analysis attributes the change in emissions to a set of dependent determinants. such as technical coefficients. the Leontief inverse and final demands. We apply our methodology to three MRIO databases – Eora. GTAP and WIOD. Findings reveal that the variation between Eora and GTAP can be attributed to differences in the Leontief inverse and emissions’ data. whereas the variation between Eora and WIOD is due to differences in final demand and the Leontief inverse.

Embodied carbon constitutes a growing proportion of whole-life carbon emissions and accounts for a significant share of total UK emissions.

This is particularly relevant for countries like the UK. which increasingly rely on products produced elsewhere in the world and thus impose pressures on foreign water resources. Existing studies calculating water footprints are mostly based on process analysis. and results are mainly available at the national level. The current paper assesses the domestic and foreign water requirements for UK final consumption by applying an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output model in combination with geo-demographic consumer segmentation data. This approach allows us to calculate water footprints (both direct and indirect) for different products as well as different geographies within the UK. We distinguished between production and consumption footprints where the former is the total water consumed from the UK domestic water resources by the production activities in the UK and the latter is the total water consumed from both domestic and global water resources to satisfy the UK domestic final consumption. The results show that the production water footprint is 439 m 3/cap/year. 85% of which is for the final consumption in the UK itself. The average consumption water footprint of the UK is more than three times bigger than the UK production water footprint in 2006.

Brockway and Randall Pruim and Tiago Domingos and Marco Sakai,10,Energies,2,1-44,MDPI,Development of energy policy is often informed by economic considerations via aggregate production functions (APFs). We identify a theory-to-policy process involving APFs comprised of six steps:(1) selecting a theoretical energy-economy framework;(2) formulating modeling approaches;(3) econometrically fitting an APF to historical economic and energy data;(4) comparing and evaluating modeling approaches;(5) interpreting the economy; and (6) formulating energy and economic policy. We find that choices made in Steps 1–4 can lead to very different interpretations of the economy (Step 5) and policies (Step 6). To investigate these effects. we use empirical data (Portugal and UK) and the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) APF to evaluate four modeling choices:(a) rejecting (or not) the cost-share principle;(b) including (or not) energy;(c) quality-adjusting (or not) factors of production; and (d) CES nesting structure. Thereafter. we discuss two revealing examples for which different upstream modeling choices lead to very different policies. In the first example. the (kl) e nesting structure implies significant investment in energy. while other nesting structures suggest otherwise. In the second example. unadjusted factors of production suggest balanced investment in labor and energy. while quality-adjusting suggests significant investment in labor over energy. Divergent outcomes provide cautionary tales for policymakers: greater understanding of upstream modeling choices and their downstream implications is needed.

1205491,Thermodynamic Efficiency Gains and their Role as a Key ‘Engine of Economic Growth’,2019,Marco Sakai and Paul E. Brockway and John R. Barrett and Peter G. Taylor,12,Energies,1,110,MDPI,Increasing energy efficiency is commonly viewed as providing a key stimulus to economic growth. through investment in efficient technologies. reducing energy use and costs. enabling productivity gains. and generating jobs. However. this view is received wisdom. as empirical validation has remained elusive. A central problem is that current energy-economy models are not thermodynamically consistent. since they do not include the transformation of energy in physical terms from primary to end-use stages. In response. we develop the UK MAcroeconometric Resource COnsumption (MARCO-UK) model. the first econometric economy-wide model to explicitly include thermodynamic efficiency and end energy use (energy services). We find gains in thermodynamic efficiency are a key ‘engine of economic growth’. contributing 25% of the increases to gross domestic product (GDP) in the UK over the period of 1971–2013. This confirms an underrecognised role for energy in enabling economic growth. We attribute most of the thermodynamic efficiency gains to endogenised technical change. We also provide new insights into how the ‘efficiency-led growth engine’mechanism works in the whole economy. Our results imply a slowdown in thermodynamic efficiency gains will constrain economic growth. whilst future energy-GDP decoupling will be harder to achieve than we suppose. This confirms the imperative for economic models to become thermodynamically consistent.

1205494,The UK’s Emissions and Employment Footprints: Exploring the Trade-Offs,2017,Marco Sakai and Anne Owen and John Barrett,9,Sustainability,7,1-19,MDPI,During the last decades. the UK economy has increasingly relied on foreign markets to fulfil its material needs. becoming a net importer of both emissions and employment. While the emissions footprint reflects the pressure that consumption exerts on the planet’s climate. the labour footprint represents the employment that is created across the globe associated with the demand for products and services. This paper has a two-fold objective. First. it focuses on analysing the behaviour over time. drivers. and sectoral and regional composition of both UK’s footprints. Second. it explores the relationship between both measures by estimating the elasticity between the growth of emissions and employment embodied in imports. The results show that around half of the emissions associated with UK consumption were generated outside its borders. while only 40% of total employment was domestic. This has important policy implications. Reducing UK’s imports can contribute to cut both its footprints. generating less emissions abroad and more employment opportunities within. However. cutting imports is challenging. since this would require a lengthy and difficult process of structural transformation. The UK could contribute to curb emissions outside its borders. while safeguarding development overseas. by offering increased support to emission-intensive trade partners in the form of technology transfer and financial aid.

Bioenergy production and consumption can help sustain smallholders’ energy needs and generate employment and income. but it also raises concerns over social justice and equity. especially where crops used for bioenergy could also be used for food.

It seeks to determine if these crops offer the potential to support smallholder farmers’ development in a more equitable way. focusing on opportunities for their use in bioenergy. We review the literature to identify policies shaping the smallholder development context in relation to these crops. assessing whose knowledge informs policy and institutional decision making. and highlighting the policy attention afforded to the different crops from different sectors. We further evaluate the literature on each crop in relation to water use and calorific value (ie. food and energy). Our review indicates that while sugarcane has received the most policy and institutional attention. its development is largely anchored in research and development investments that support large-scale commercial farms and agri-businesses.

Moreover. climate projections point to an increase in the frequency and severity of those events. Cities across the world must thus assess their vulnerabilities to extreme events and adapt accordingly. Compared to big metropolises. smaller cities face more opportunities to adapt their practices to defend and protect from these impacts. since in many cases they are still not locked-in by existing infrastructure. and show greater potential for future sustainable urban planning. Nevertheless. few studies have assessed the vulnerability of small cities. which generally present fastest population growth rates. along with lack of capacities. resources and financing options. This paper investigates the vulnerability of Ciudad del Este. Paraguay. which is expected to be among the top five fastest growing cities in Latin America by 2030. The analysis is based on a mixed methods approach. combining quantitative and qualitative techniques. Quantitatively. an Urban Vulnerability Index was built using 73 economic. social. climatic and environmental indicators. in order to quantify the sensitivity of the city to extreme weather events. as well as its capacity to cope and adapt to those events. In qualitative terms. data collected from interviews was used to complement the quantitative findings. The results show that the city is highly sensitive to extreme weather events. due to its vastly urbanised area. lack of green spaces and amount of vulnerable and exposed population. The city also shows a lack of adequate urban planning and a low capacity to plan for weather and …,True,HnbfL7AAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,3,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/125789/,2650101632397581018,/scholar?cites=2650101632397581018,,,0,0,0

Several initiatives have been created over recent years to engage major cities around the world to strengthen their efforts to become greener and more environmentally friendly and. at the same time. more resilient to extreme weather phenomena. while improving the living standards of their populations. This focus on cities is significantly relevant as it is expected that the majority of people in the planet will live in cities by mid-century. In the case of South America. the UN (2016) expects that around 80% of its population will be urban by 2050. Concurrently. cities are expected to increasingly face climate effects in the form of more intense and frequent extreme weather events over the years. putting at risk millions of people. especially those that are more vulnerable. Existing studies (IPCC. 2014) have shown that Latin America is particularly exposed to weather-related events and displays numerous vulnerabilities (eg poverty. economic and political instability. lack of resources and infrastructure. etc.). Based on a number of climate projections for the region developed by various teams of researchers (IPCC 2014). which show increasing trends in extreme climate variability. it is essential for Latin American countries to undertake actions to reduce their vulnerability and foster climate-resilient development.

Silent Spring. still stands as a “beacon of reason”(Nature 485. 578–579; 2012). The insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyl trichloro ethane) was arguably the most successful chemical ever synthesized to control malaria and other insectborne diseases. However. Silent Springled to a US ban on DDT use in 1972. Carson branded DDT as dangerous because of its effects at high doses on experimental rodents and birds. But it was already known that humans experienced no ill effects after consuming 35 milligrams of DDT daily for two years—a dose 1.000 times higher than that received from agricultural exposure.

Stringer and Nicola Favretto and Marco Sakai and Paola Sakai,13,Sustainability,2,552,MDPI,The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. including the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). will shape national development plans up to 2030. SDGs 1 (No Poverty). 2 (Zero Hunger) and 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) are particularly crucial for the poor. given they target the basic human needs for development and fundamental human rights. The majority of poor and malnourished people in the developing world live in rural areas and engage in farming as a key part of their livelihoods. with food and agriculture at the heart of their development concerns. Crops that can provide both food and energy without detrimental impacts on soil or water resources can be particularly beneficial for local development and smallholder farmers. Sweet potato. in particular. is starting to attract growing attention from researchers and policymakers as it has the potential to address these global problems and promote a sustainable society. We systematically review the literature to assess how sweet potato can support smallholder farmers to make progress towards the SDGs. We find that sweet potato has important untapped potential to advance progress. particularly linked to its versatility as a crop and its multiple end-uses. However. further research is paramount in order to better recognise and harness its potential to address the issues of food. nutrition and energy security in the context of a changing global climate. Further investigation is also needed into the trade-offs that occur in the use of sweet potato to support progress towards the SDGs.

McGregor and Andrew G. Ross and Graeme Roy and J. Kim Swales and Karen Turner,,UKERC publication,,1-89,UKERC,Achieving the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions set out in the UK Climate Change Act will require a significant transformation in the UK's energy system. At the same time. the government is pursuing a new UK Industrial Strategy. which aims to improve labour productivity. create high-quality jobs and boost exports across the UK. The economic and the energy systems in the UK are tightly linked and so policies adopted in one area will produce spillover effects to the other. To achieve the objectives set out in the two strategies it is therefore vital to understand how the policies in the energy system will affect economic development and vice versa. This study seeks to contribute to this by investigating how an increase in exports (a key pillar in the UK Industrial Strategy) could impact energy- and industrial policy. We address this question by systematically comparing the results of two types of energy-economy models of the UK. a computable general equilibrium model and a macroeconometric model. In terms of the implications of a successful export promotion strategy. the models agree that there is likely to be a beneficial impact on the economy. but an adverse impact on CO2 emissions and energy intensity. This reveals the extent of any policy adjustment that would be required to maintain a given level of emissions and serves to emphasise the need to complement UK industrial policies with appropriate action on energy use and carbon emissions to meet statutory carbon targets set by the Climate Change Act (2008).

In light of the essential global challenge of climate change and the need to transform energy systems. we believe such ambition is needed and should be replicated in other jurisdictions. In this sense. we believe the Scottish Government is taking a valuable lead. We do not seek to judge the political advantages (or disadvantages) of such ambition. but recognise that it has the potential to bring economic and social advantages–for example. the development of low carbon industrial capability with export potential and jobs. and improved air quality with associated health benefits. However. it is also important to ensure that the scale and pace of the transition minimises the additional costs for consumers. This can be achieved by supporting technological innovation that further reduces the costs of low carbon technologies. and by maximising investments in energy efficiency.If such a strategy is to attract the necessary stakeholder investment and societal change. the set of targets and policies to achieve those targets also needs to be credible. Many of the comments we make below draw on the available evidence in order to help establish and maintain this credibility.

Practical guidance on undertaking valuation studies that are readily applicable for water policy purposes is necessary given the economic value of water. the important role of water economics in underpinning the WFD. and the limited economic information and expertise in many river basin authorities. The Guidelines are targeted at expert practitioners and economic specialists who carry out valuation studies. rather than policy advisors or policy/decisionmakers. The latter are targeted through the AquaMoney policy briefs (see www. aquamoney. org).The Guidelines provide guidance on how to address specific key issues in economic valuation studies of water resources and how. given a variety of difficulties encountered. these values can be aggregated to determine a water resource‟ s Total Economic Value. The Guidelines look at how these values can be aggregated from the level of an individual water body to river basin level. whilst accounting for changes in substitution possibilities regarding water use as one moves upstream or downstream or across separate water bodies in a river basin.

This is due to several barriers to the uptake of the prescribed environmentally beneficial farm management practices. most of which have been well established by social science research. Yet it is unclear why these barriers remain so difficult to overcome despite numerous and persistent attempts at the design. communication and enforcement of related agricultural policies. This paper examines the potential of fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) as a tool to disentangle the underlying reasons of this persistent problem.

The ELD requires the testing of appropriate equivalency methods to assess the scale of compensatory measures needed to offset damage. The aim of this paper is to contribute to fill the existing knowledge gap on the application of the value equivalency approach for damage compensation in this context. We analyze the toxic spill damaging the Doñana National Park (Spain) in 1998. The welfare losses associated with the resource damage are estimated using non-market valuation and compared to the value of the compensatory measures taken after the accident.

The EU water framework directive and the politics of exemptions,2016,Blandine Boeuf and Oliver Fritsch and Julia Martin-Ortega,8,Water,9,388,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is the core legislative instrument in the European Union for the protection of water resources. Adopted in 2000. its objectives were to achieve “good status” for water bodies by 2015 and prevent any further deterioration. However. the European Commission and some stakeholders are rather dissatisfied with the implementation of the Directive so far. in particular with the use of exemptions to the environmental objectives. Exemptions are of paramount importance: they may constitute a significant obstacle to the achievement of the WFD’s objectives as they enable member states to lower the ambition of the Directive and to delay the achievement of good status. thereby undermining the environmental goal of the WFD. Critical voices observe an excessive reliance on exemptions. poor justifications. and great variations in their use. Based on an analysis of 120 policy documents and 15 semi-structured interviews. this article provides explanations for the politics of exemptions in EU water management. It shows that different viewpoints and interpretations on the WFD’s objectives and exemptions were already present in the negotiation phase of the Directive. but remained undefined on purpose. Moreover. dysfunctional decision-making procedures in the Common Implementation Strategy and the lack of political support in WFD implementation were significant obstacles to an agreement on this important issue. Finally. decisions on WFD implementation in member states were often driven by pragmatism.

The aim of this paper is to estimate the non-market benefits that society attaches to the use of reclaimed wastewater for agricultural purposes. as part of the economic assessment needed to evaluate the viability of this water management option. For this purpose. a contingent valuation study has been developed in the Segura River Basin in south-eastern Spain. interviewing 352 individuals from a representative sample of the basin  s population. Results show that the use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation has significant non-market environmental benefits (mean willingness to pay of  5.13 per month per household. which adds up to a total annual value of  23.3 million). In terms of volume. these benefits represent  0.31 m  3. Therefore. it can be concluded that the non-market benefits of using reclaimed wastewater for agriculture justify its implementation. as they overcome the average treatment costs of  0.16-0.26 m  3. Additionally. the analysis of preference heterogeneity suggests that the use of reclaimed wastewater in agriculture is more acceptable to people if they are made aware of their current payment for water sanitation.

In areas of water scarcity the reuse of treated water for agricultural irrigation is seen as a promising option to reduce the quantitative pressure on the resource. As part of assessing the viability of reclaimed water use in agriculture. and in accordance with the economic principles underpinning the WFD. a comprehensive economic analysis of this irrigation option is needed.

Using indicators designed to measure a ‘safe and just’development space. we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs. and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition. sanitation. access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However. the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example. high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2–6 times the sustainable level. based on current relationships.

The scientific and public debate has brought forth a broad spectrum of views and narratives on this question. ranging from neoclassical economics to degrowth. We argue that different positions can be attributed to underlying differences in views on (a) factors that determine human well‐being. (b) the feasibility and desirability of economic growth. (c) appropriate intervention points. and (d) preferences about governance and policy options. For each of these dimensions. we propose points of agreement on which a consensus between conflicting positions might be achieved. From this basis. we distill a sustainability transition perspective that could act as a basis for a renewed debate on how to align human well‐being with environmental sustainability.This article is categorized under: Climate Economics …,True,2MMJ6MgAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,3,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.677,15292084152392053056,/scholar?cites=15292084152392053056,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wcc.677,0,0,0

Establishing minimum and maximum standards of consumption (or “consumption corridors”) has been suggested as a way to address this crisis. Consumption corridors provide the normative basis for sustainable consumption. that is. enough consumption for individuals to satisfy needs. but not too much to collectively surpass environmental limits. Current consumption patterns (especially in the global North) do not yet fall within consumption corridors. and standards are not fixed over time.

1205557,Identifying and learning from sustainable development pathways,2016,William F Lamb,,,,,,On May 9th 2013 the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii recorded an average daily atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration of 400 parts per million (Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 2013). This milestone was largely symbolic. but when compared to ice core samples it is the highest concentration recorded in 800.000 years and a 40% increase over preindustrial levels (IPCC. 2013). These heightened levels of CO2. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes. are the result of anthropogenic land use change. industrial and fossil fuel emissions. and are the primary driver of observed warming in recent decades.Climate change is expected to have severe and long term impacts on physical. biological and human systems worldwide. Such impacts may be borne out through changes in the water cycle. shifts in disease vectors. and more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves. droughts and tropical cyclones (IPCC. 2014a). Developing countries are known to have particular geographies that enhance their risks: many are located in the drought-prone. arid sub-Saharan Africa. and flood-prone coastal areas in South Asia and the Pacific. Such risks in these countries will likely be exacerbated by limited funds. fragile institutions and a lack of technical knowledge for adaptation. rendering the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions a morally unambiguous and urgent endeavour (Gough. 2015; Winkler et al.. 2011).,True,2MMJ6MgAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,2,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/60832156/FULL_TEXT.PDF,9199924256919009116,/scholar?cites=9199924256919009116,,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/60832156/FULL_TEXT.PDF,0,0,0

It focuses on the exergy replacement cost (ERC). which measures the amount of exergy society would have to consume in order to re-concentrate an extracted and processed mineral to the point that it can be once more exploited by future generations. The ERC. which was originally only suitable for non-fuel minerals. was adapted and extended in 2016. by changing the focus of the ERC from the chemical composition of the resource to its function. to include fossil fuel depletion.

Unfortunately. some of these methods have given rise to perverse socio-environmental effects; as materials have been unnecessarily sacrificed. mines and wells have opened and plantations grown. in the name of energy saving. This paper contributes to clean energy-orientated policies and practices by exploring the discipline of sustainable materials. We first review two strategies: energy efficiency linked to materials; and material efficiency. meaning “doing more with less.” We find that. although both contribute significantly. they are hampered by the rebound effect and their focus on “doing less bad” rather than “good”. Furthermore. they do not in themselves evaluate the services and societal wellbeing that materials provide. We then define “material services” and propose a wider strategy that encompasses and enhances the previous two. Under the new strategy. we argue that sustainable materials should be considered as those that do no harm and which optimally. through the services provided. contribute to better sustainable development policies and practices.

In turn. Utilitarian notions have generated the belief that infinite growth is not only good but necessary for society to prosper. Unsurprisingly. this belief system has supported the considerable depletion of natural resources and has not always led to social equitability or environmental justice. two pillars of sustainable development. Given these limitations. this paper looks into eudaimonic wellbeing. as defined by Stoicism. The latter originating in Classical Greece and Ancient Rome. has been used throughout the centuries to discuss and support the flourishing of individuals. but has rarely been applied to collective wellbeing. Consequently. we explore whether. and to what extent. this virtue-based philosophy can answer questions regarding the value and the role of material acquisition in societal development. as directed by sustainable policy. We propose the idea that the Stoic emphasis on prudence. self-control. courage and justice. as the only means to achieve “happiness”. is intrinsically linked to sustainable wellbeing and that its principles can be used to demonstrate that society does not require limitless growth to flourish.

Exergy replacement costs (ERC). an indicator based on the second law of thermodynamics. provides a physical value of mineral loss. When only a unit mass analysis is used. the role of scarcer minerals. such as gold. is obscured. ERC can identify those minerals which are most critical and more difficult to re-concentrate. This paper compares the mineral depletion of that of Colombia and Spain for 2011. both in mass and ERC terms. The Colombian mineral balance for that year is predominately based on fossil fuel extraction and exports. whilst Spain produced industrial minerals but relied heavily upon metals and fossil fuel imports. Using exergy replacement costs. an economic analysis was carried out to determine the impact of mineral extraction. in monetary terms. should the cost of re-concentrating such minerals be taken into account. In 2011. the GDP derived from the extractive sectors of either country did not compensate the mineral resource loss. meaning that mineral patrimony is not being properly evaluated.

Specifically. it measures the amount of exergy society would have to expend if it were forced to re-capture and re-concentrate dispersed minerals back into a manmade usable deposit. Due to an assumption regarding the non-substitutability of fossil fuels. the original method failed to properly account for them. In fact. it sub-estimated their exergy replacement cost forty-seven-fold. on average. when considering solar radiation to fuel. and by approximately fivefold when going from crop to fuel. This new method. via the cumulative exergy consumption (CExC). calculates the exergy replacement cost of photosynthesis and bio-energy production. as together they form the best available technology when it comes to closing the carbon cycle. This approach ties together the “cradle to grave” to the “grave to cradle”. standardises the ERC calculations and enables comparisons between fuel and non-fuel mineral consumption. It also opens a discussion as to the role of the ERC in sustainability debates and whether resource depletion should be a matter of geological patrimony or material/energy services.

In this case study. the highest direct blue footprint registers 0.19 m 3/barrel and is heavily influenced by cyclic steam stimulation practices. This value could be reduced if the water coming out of the production well was to be cleaned with highly advanced wastewater treatment technologies. The highest grey water footprint. at 0.06 m 3/barrel. is minimal and could be reduced with conventional wastewater treatment technologies and rigorous maintenance procedures. The green water footprint is negligible and cannot be reduced for legal reasons. The indirect blue water footprint is also considerable at 0.19–0.22 m 3/barrel and could be reduced if electricity was produced onsite instead of purchased. In addition. the paper identifies methodological flaws in the Colombian National Water Study (2014). which wrongly calculated the direct blue water footprint. leading to a 5 to 32-fold sub-estimation.

Yet. technology allows for the replacement of fossil fuels by bio-products. The key contribution of this paper is to apply the life cycle assessment to fossil fuel bio-equivalents thus tying together the cradle to grave to the grave to cradle approach. which enables comparisons between fuel and non-fuel mineral depletion. The methodology developed gives an improved estimate of the exergy required to replace fossil fuels. not in terms of their composition or origin but with regards to the role they play in society and Nature. The current procedure of using the chemical exergy of fossil fuels to represent the cost of their replacement. sub-estimates the exergy replacement cost twenty-eight fold. on average. This difference in magnitude occurs due to the omission of the exergy bonus that is created when plants concentrate solar energy and convert it into biomass. This forges a paradigm shift towards looking at the function of a mineral. rather than its chemical composition. which has questionable relevance in the sustainable development discourse.,True,Cu-BwFcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,3,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12358702168641057825&hl=en&oi=scholarr,12358702168641057825,/scholar?cites=12358702168641057825,,,0,0,0
1205577,Stoic theology: Revealing or redundant?,2019,Kai Whiting and Leonidas Konstantakos,10,Religions,3,193,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,With the notion of advancing a modern Stoic environmental ethical framework. we explore the philosophy’s call to “living according to Nature”. as derived from ancient Stoic theology. We do this by evaluating the orthodox (ancient) viewpoint and the contemporary criticisms levelled against it. We reflect on the atheistic interpretations of Stoicism and their associated call to “live according to the facts”. We consider the limitations that this call has when applied to societal. and particularly non-human matters. We do not undertake this research with the aim of determining which view of Stoic theology is right or wrong. However. we contest one of the assumptions of the heterodox approach. namely that the Stoic worldview is incompatible with modern scientific thinking. Indeed. we demonstrate how Stoic theology. far from being outdated or irrelevant. is actually refreshingly contemporary in that it provides the tools. scope and urgency with which to deliver a far more considerate ethical framework for the 21st century. Finally. we suggest where Stoic theology can help practitioners to reframe and respond to environmental challenges. which we argue forms part of their cosmopolitan obligation to take care of themselves. others and the Earth as a whole.

A Stoic Approach,2018,Kai Whiting and Leonidas Konstantakos and Greg Sadler and Christopher Gill,7,Humanities,2,39,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper adopts the philosophical approach of Stoicism as the basis for re-examining the cognitive and ethical relationship between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. Stoicism sets out a clear criterion for the special moral status of human beings. namely rationality. We explore to what extent Neanderthals were sufficiently rational to be considered “human”. Recent findings in the fields of palaeoanthropology and palaeogenetics show that Neanderthals possessed high-level cognitive abilities and produced viable offspring with anatomically modern humans. Our discussion offers insights for reflecting on the relationship between humans and other forms of natural life and any moral obligations that result.

It has enabled the possibility of research into areas previously unreachable and has led to the discovery of some of the most complex phenomena on the planet such as Chaos Theory. The exponential growth of computer capabilities has led to an impressive advance in the recognition of complexity and uncertainty.

1205596,The changing perspectives of three Muslim men on the question of saint worship over a 10-year period in Gujarat. Western India,2008,Edward Simpson,,Modern Asian Studies,,377-403,Cambridge University Press,In many religious traditions. those who mediate relations between men and gods are often the focus of controversy and moral ambiguity. The ethnography in this paper outlines a number of perspectives on the role of such intermediaries (here 'saints') in Muslim society in western India. In the South Asian literature. historians have provided a thorough treatment of the doctrinal history and content of these debates. However. very little attention has been paid to how living individuals interpret and rehearse these debates in practice. The examination of the changing perspectives of three Muslim men on the question of saint worship over a 10 year period reveals the following. First. an individual's relationship with 'saints' is often determined primarily by social context rather than simply by doctrinal allegiance or the compulsions of particular 'beliefs'. Second. discourses of religious reform are also powerful social objects …,True,1islSY0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,26,https://www.jstor.org/stable/20488024,10551012724510804477,/scholar?cites=10551012724510804477,,https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/4572/1/ChangingPerspectives.pdf,0,0,0

Specialists in South Asia are also habitually more prone to relate their findings to pan-Indian structures and themes than to linkages beyond the subcontinent and across the ocean. If. however. anthropologists seek to rectify this limitation by following up the connections that emerge from their ethnographic findings and turn to the Indian Ocean. they encounter specific methodological problems.

The processual structures and regulative mechanisms that produce anthropological knowledge were formed when objection and engagement were not the almost-inevitable consequence of publication. Those who inform anthropological research now frequently object to the ways they are represented. My argument here focuses particularly on the relationship between the ethical structures of anthropology and the nature of objection. Thus far. the consistent response from anthropologists has been to explain away objections as differences in epistemology. In this light.

Colombia for 2012. which for the first time augments traditional industrial and mobile sources by including commercial sources. biogenic sources. and resuspended dust. We characterized the methodologies for estimating each source annually. and allocated the sources to hourly and 1 km 2 spatial resolution for use as inputs for air quality modeling purposes. A resuspended particulate matter (RPM) emission estimate was developed using the first measurements of road dust loadings and silt content for the city. Results show that mobile sources dominate emissions of CO 2 (80%). CO (99%). VOC (68%). NO x (95%). and SO 2 (85%). However. the newly estimated RPM comprises 90% of total PM 10 emissions. which are at least onefold larger than the PM 10 emissions from combustion processes. The 2012 EI was implemented in a chemical transport model (CTM) in order to understand the pollutants’ fate and transport.

1205615,Material services with both eyes wide open,2017,Luis Gabriel Carmona and Kai Whiting and Angeles Carrasco and Tânia Sousa and Tiago Domingos,9,,9,1508,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Energy has been at the forefront of the sustainable development discourse for quite some time as policymakers. industry heads and society at large have taken progressive steps to cut carbon via renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency measures. Unfortunately. some of these methods have given rise to perverse socio-environmental effects; as materials have been unnecessarily sacrificed. mines and wells have opened and plantations grown. in the name of energy saving. This paper contributes to clean energy-orientated policies and practices by exploring the discipline of sustainable materials. We first review two strategies: energy efficiency linked to materials; and material efficiency. meaning “doing more with less.” We find that. although both contribute significantly. they are hampered by the rebound effect and their focus on “doing less bad” rather than “good”. Furthermore. they do not in themselves evaluate the services and societal wellbeing that materials provide. We then define “material services” and propose a wider strategy that encompasses and enhances the previous two. Under the new strategy. we argue that sustainable materials should be considered as those that do no harm and which optimally. through the services provided. contribute to better sustainable development policies and practices.

1205617,Sustainable development. wellbeing and material consumption: A stoic perspective,2018,Kai Whiting and Leonidas Konstantakos and Angeles Carrasco and Luis Gabriel Carmona,10,Sustainability,2,474,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Since the introduction of neoclassical economic theory. material wealth and accumulation have been linked to hedonic wellbeing. In turn. Utilitarian notions have generated the belief that infinite growth is not only good but necessary for society to prosper. Unsurprisingly. this belief system has supported the considerable depletion of natural resources and has not always led to social equitability or environmental justice. two pillars of sustainable development. Given these limitations. this paper looks into eudaimonic wellbeing. as defined by Stoicism. The latter originating in Classical Greece and Ancient Rome. has been used throughout the centuries to discuss and support the flourishing of individuals. but has rarely been applied to collective wellbeing. Consequently. we explore whether. and to what extent. this virtue-based philosophy can answer questions regarding the value and the role of material acquisition in societal development. as directed by sustainable policy. We propose the idea that the Stoic emphasis on prudence. self-control. courage and justice. as the only means to achieve “happiness”. is intrinsically linked to sustainable wellbeing and that its principles can be used to demonstrate that society does not require limitless growth to flourish.

Exergy replacement costs (ERC). an indicator based on the second law of thermodynamics. provides a physical value of mineral loss. When only a unit mass analysis is used. the role of scarcer minerals. such as gold. is obscured. ERC can identify those minerals which are most critical and more difficult to re-concentrate. This paper compares the mineral depletion of that of Colombia and Spain for 2011. both in mass and ERC terms. The Colombian mineral balance for that year is predominately based on fossil fuel extraction and exports. whilst Spain produced industrial minerals but relied heavily upon metals and fossil fuel imports. Using exergy replacement costs. an economic analysis was carried out to determine the impact of mineral extraction. in monetary terms. should the cost of re-concentrating such minerals be taken into account. In 2011. the GDP derived from the extractive sectors of either country did not compensate the mineral resource loss. meaning that mineral patrimony is not being properly evaluated.

Specifically. it measures the amount of exergy society would have to expend if it were forced to re-capture and re-concentrate dispersed minerals back into a manmade usable deposit. Due to an assumption regarding the non-substitutability of fossil fuels. the original method failed to properly account for them. In fact. it sub-estimated their exergy replacement cost forty-seven-fold. on average. when considering solar radiation to fuel. and by approximately fivefold when going from crop to fuel. This new method. via the cumulative exergy consumption (CExC). calculates the exergy replacement cost of photosynthesis and bio-energy production. as together they form the best available technology when it comes to closing the carbon cycle. This approach ties together the “cradle to grave” to the “grave to cradle”. standardises the ERC calculations and enables comparisons between fuel and non-fuel mineral consumption. It also opens a discussion as to the role of the ERC in sustainability debates and whether resource depletion should be a matter of geological patrimony or material/energy services.

1205624,The water footprint of heavy oil extraction in Colombia: a case study,2017,Luis Gabriel Carmona and Kai Whiting and Angeles Carrasco,9,Water,5,340,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper is a Colombian case study that calculates the total water footprint (blue. green. and grey) for heavy crude production (11.5 average API gravity) occurring in three fields. located in the Magdalena watershed. In this case study. the highest direct blue footprint registers 0.19 m 3/barrel and is heavily influenced by cyclic steam stimulation practices. This value could be reduced if the water coming out of the production well was to be cleaned with highly advanced wastewater treatment technologies. The highest grey water footprint. at 0.06 m 3/barrel. is minimal and could be reduced with conventional wastewater treatment technologies and rigorous maintenance procedures. The green water footprint is negligible and cannot be reduced for legal reasons. The indirect blue water footprint is also considerable at 0.19–0.22 m 3/barrel and could be reduced if electricity was produced onsite instead of purchased. In addition. the paper identifies methodological flaws in the Colombian National Water Study (2014). which wrongly calculated the direct blue water footprint. leading to a 5 to 32-fold sub-estimation. It also ignored the grey. with important implications for water resource policy and management. To rectify the situation. future National Surveys should follow the procedure published here.

Yet. technology allows for the replacement of fossil fuels by bio-products. The key contribution of this paper is to apply the life cycle assessment to fossil fuel bio-equivalents thus tying together the cradle to grave to the grave to cradle approach. which enables comparisons between fuel and non-fuel mineral depletion. The methodology developed gives an improved estimate of the exergy required to replace fossil fuels. not in terms of their composition or origin but with regards to the role they play in society and Nature. The current procedure of using the chemical exergy of fossil fuels to represent the cost of their replacement. sub-estimates the exergy replacement cost twenty-eight fold. on average. This difference in magnitude occurs due to the omission of the exergy bonus that is created when plants concentrate solar energy and convert it into biomass.

The scope of this analysis is from resource extraction (primary exergy stage) to end uses such as low temperature heating and illumination (useful exergy stage). From 1900 to 2010. global exergy consumption at the primary stage increased from 115 to 903 EJ/year. of which 88–89% corresponded to energy flows. including food and feed. Useful exergy flows increased from 9 to 148 EJ/year. of which 47%. in 2010. was contained within material goods. Primary to useful efficiency doubled from 8% in 1900 to 16% in 2010.

Similarly. while in sparse areas most households without cars are either virtually immobile or reliant on car lifts. in large urban areas the ‘mobility gap’ between car-owning and carless households is considerably smaller. as the latter are able to use modal alternatives to the car.

While the first two approaches have been dominant. this paper further develops the third. addressing questions as to whether and why certain activities are inherently more difficult to switch away from the car. At the theoretical level. it builds on theories of social practice to put forward the notion of ‘car dependent practices’.

FCO is thought to result in households cutting expenditure on other necessities and/or reducing travel activity to the bare minimum. both of which may result in social exclusion. Social exclusion research. on the other hand. has paid much attention to ""material deprivation"". i.e.. the economic strain and enforced lack of durable goods arising from low income. However. the FCO phenomenon suggests that. among households with limited resources. the enforced possession and use of a durable good can be the cause of material deprivation. economic stress and vulnerability to fuel price increases. In this study. we use 2012 EU ‘Income and Living Conditions' data (EU-SILC) to shed light on FCO in two European countries (UK and Germany). Through secondary data analysis we are able to show: the social and spatial patterns of FCO; key differences between FCO and ""car deprived"" households; the intensity of social exclusion. material deprivation. and economic strain among FCO households; and overlaps between FCO and economic stress in other life domains (domestic fuel poverty. housing cost overburden). The results also show contrasting spatial patterns of FCO in Germany (higher incidence in rural areas) and UK (similar incidence in urban and rural areas). which can be explained in light of the different socio-spatial configurations prevalent in the two countries.

The aim of this study was to investigate the trends in individual multimodality in England. In addition. we explored whether these trends were homogenous. i.e. similar between socio-economic characteristics. and whether changes in multimodality corresponded with changes in car use and the use of other transport modes. Our analyses showed that in contrast to reported trends in existing research. the level of multimodality in England decreased between 1995 and 2015. These trends stratified by income were diverging. which may imply that inequality in transport opportunities may be increasing. In contrast. the trends for age and gender were converging.

The negative impacts of fuel price spikes in terms of increased household expenditure and economic stress are unevenly spatially and socially distributed.

Quotidian Mobility and Urban Ethnography,,57-74,,Cities are generally considered as ideal sites for walking higher densities reduce distances between residences and activity destinations. making it possible to reach them on foot. Similarly. when city centres date from the pre-industrial and pre-motorization age. they generally offer plenty of pedestrian-friendly spaces that make the walking experience all the more enjoyable. For this reason. urban Scholars frequently contrast pedestrian friendly cities to motorized urban sprawl. where the car dominates daily travel patterns. However. this approach neglects another feature of urbanity: public transport. Transport research shows that in dense cities buses. tramways. Subways and trains account for a non-negligible share of trips and travel distance. often higher than walking. Moreover. walking in the city does not always mean just walking. Indeed. most journeys made using public transport (unlike car journeys) include short walks to and from stops. and for this reason walking distance to stops is considered as a crucial measure of public transport accessibility. On the other hand. while moving through the city. urban dwellers often walk through spaces of public transport such as the Subway network. tramway cars and the like. This is especially true for European cities. where car dependence is lower than in American and Australian cities (Newman and Kenworty 1999). despite being higher than the rest of the world. In 2009. public transport accounted for 17.3 per cent of the passenger-kilometres travelled by powered transport in the EU-27. with national figures ranging from 8 per cent (Lithuania) to 40 per cent (Hungary)(European Commission 2011: 41 …,True,osb4TscAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,13,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3jygCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA57&dq=info:gr5BRfHaK6AJ:scholar.google.com&ots=hWHMI5Ge37&sig=OlC6bTCwS1PTd5W5M2NyHYqKPgE,11541559199850937986,/scholar?cites=11541559199850937986,,http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2164/3242/Reprint_chapter.pdf;sequence=1,0,0,0

Sustainability and the Transport Policy Stalemate: The Potential Trade-offs between Intra- and Inter-generational Equity,2013,Giulio Mattioli,8,The International Journal of Sustainability Policy and Practice,1,45-57,,The sustainability concept. as originally defined. comprises three meta-goals: growth. intra-generational (social) equity and environmental protection (that is. inter-generational equity). In this context. while the potential trade-offs growth vs. environment and growth vs. intra-generational equity have been frequently addressed. the possible tensions between intra-generational and inter-generational equity have received only limited attention. This is true also for studies on “sustainable transport”. often concerned with the seemingly unstoppable rise of car ownership and use. This latter process is. on the one hand. a major determinant of environmental unsustainability; on the other hand. however. it entails a crucial intra-generational equity dimension. related to the differential in accessibility to services and opportunities between car users and non-car users. Accordingly. in this paper. I argue that the very nature of car dependence–defined as a dynamic and self-reinforcing macro-social process with systemic properties–urges scholars to focus on the trade-offs between intra-and inter-generational equity. Indeed. every increase in the level of car dependence widens the disadvantage gap between those who are part of the car system and those who are left out of it. but at the same time reduces the number of the latter. For this reason. its implications for intra-generational equity are very equivocal. On the other hand. most of the policies envisaged to fight car dependence are feared to have negative impacts on intra-generational equity. and thus often meet strong resistance.

1205653,The affordability of household transport costs: quantifying the incidence of car-related economic stress in Great Britain,2016,Giulio Mattioli and Karen Lucas and Greg Marsden,,,,,Leeds,There is increasing concern for the affordability of daily mobility costs. notably by car. In this paper. we use the term ‘car-related economic stress’ (CRES) to refer to households spending a disproportionate amount of money on car travel. We propose two indicators to investigate CRES in Great Britain. both of which are based on widely available. continuous surveys. First. a 'Low-Income-High-Costs' metric. inspired by the UK government indicator of fuel poverty. and applied to the Living Costs and Food Survey. We complement this with the analysis of a material deprivation-based measure of CRES. based on the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. Our analysis suggests that. in 2012. CRES affected between 6.7% and 9% of households in Great Britain. corresponding to between 1.7 and 2.3 million households. Low population density and difficult access to public transport are associated with a higher risk of CRES. In terms of social profile. households at risk of CRES are not so different from the average of the population. but are clearly distinct from low income households with low motoring costs and from households who cannot afford cars. Our analysis identifies a number of socio-economic factors (household size. presence of children. underemployment. disability) which may increase the ratio between car travel needs and household income. thus increasing the risk of economic stress.,True,osb4TscAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,12,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/92738/,10806142918380908694,/scholar?cites=10806142918380908694,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/92738/8/UTSG_paper_v1.1.pdf,0,0,0

Parallèlement. dans plusieurs pays se pose la question du caractère abordable du logement. Cette communication porte sur les liens entre dépenses pour le transport. pour le logement et dépenses énergétiques dans l’habitat. A l’aide d’une revue de la littérature en anglais. français et allemand. nous illustrons comment ces questions ont été mises en relation en France. en Allemagne et au Royaume-Uni. Le contexte britannique se caractérise par une forte tradition de recherche et d’action politique sur la pauvreté et l’exclusion sociale dans les trois secteurs. y compris dans les transports. Pourtant. alors que les problèmes d’accessibilité aux services des ménages sans voiture ont attiré beaucoup l’attention. le stress économique des ménages motorisés et sa dimension territoriale ont été moins étudiés. De même. les arbitrages des ménages entre dépenses pour le transport et pour l’habitat face au choix résidentiel sont peu présents dans le débat. La notion de «fuel poverty» est bien établie au Royaume-Uni depuis vingt ans. mais elle n’inclut que les coûts énergétiques dans l’habitat et. en dépit des demandes de chercheurs et activistes. le concept de «transport poverty» a du mal à s’ imposer.

Building on previous research. we define and operationalise three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure (the cost burden of motor fuel). sensitivity (income) and adaptive capacity (accessibility with modes alternative to the car). We exploit unique data sets available in England. including the ‘MOT’ vehicle inspection data and DfT Accessibility Statistics. This allows us to map vulnerability to fuel price increases at a spatially disaggregated level (Lower-layer Super Output Areas). taking into account motor-fuel expenditure for all travel purposes. and the ability of households to shift to other modes of travel. This is an advancement on the ‘oil vulnerability’ indices developed in previous international research.,True,osb4TscAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,10,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/110743/,9690678420226254904,/scholar?cites=9690678420226254904,,https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/110743/1/Mattioli%20Philips%20Anable%20Chatterton%20Developing%20an%20index%20of%20vulnerability%20to%20motor%20fuel%20price%20increases%20in%20England.pdf,0,0,0

Inequality and Poverty in the UK: Briefing prepared for UN Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights,2018,Kate Bayliss and Giulio Mattioli,116,SRI PAPERS,,,Sustainability Research Institute. University of Leeds,Since the late 1980s. successive governments have increased the role of the private sector in the provision of basic services in the UK. particularly in England. In addition. shifting global trends have led to financial innovation. providing more imaginative methods of sweating capital assets and extracting revenue. As a result. the provision of services to meet fundamental human needs has become a source of profit for international financiers. diverting revenue streams from potentially progressive provision and infrastructure investment. Households. many of which struggle to make ends meet. are in some cases financing interest and dividend payments to the world’s richest via their consumption of basic essentials (here. water. energy and local buses).,True,osb4TscAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,9,https://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/fileadmin/Documents/research/sri/workingpapers/SRIPs-116.pdf,11058287684951182529,/scholar?cites=11058287684951182529,,https://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/fileadmin/Documents/research/sri/workingpapers/SRIPs-116.pdf,0,0,0
1205659,Different worlds of non-motoring: households without cars in Germany,2013,Giulio Mattioli,,,,,Klartext,The composition of the carless population is arguably a good indicator for the level of car dependence of a local area. Indeed. the group of households without a car in inner cities is not only larger. but also more diverse in terms of socio-demographic composition and more mobile in terms of travel behaviour. By contrast. non-car ownership in peripheral and rural areas is rarer and more concentrated in marginal social groups. who are also less mobile overall. In this paper. I provide evidence to support this hypothesis on the basis of a secondary analysis of the German national travel survey for the year 2008.

These policies are based on the assumption that increasing multimodality will contribute to a reduction in emissions. Yet. hardly any scientific attention has been paid to the empirical relationship between multimodality and CO2 emissions. This article addresses this unexplored question at both the individual and trip level using the English National Travel Survey. We find that the level of multimodality is only weakly associated with CO2 emissions. It is only when controlling for levels of travel activity (trip frequency. total distance travelled) that a moderate association in the expected direction is observed (i.e. that higher levels of multimodality correspond with lower CO2 emissions). This suggests that greater levels of travel activity among …,True,osb4TscAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136192091930118X,5675080629532161846,/scholar?cites=5675080629532161846,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/150037/3/MM%20and%20CO2final_dep.pdf,0,0,0
1205661,Milan’s pollution charge: sustainable transport and the politics of evidence,2012,Giulio Mattioli and Mario Boffi and Matteo Colleoni,,,,,,The city of Milan. one of the most car-dependent and polluted in Europe. is also among the few to have introduced a road pricing measure. The story of how this happened is of great interest. for it shows how EU regulations. scientific evidence and political action at the local level have concurred to bring about change in the city’s transport policy. Unlike the well-known cases of London and Stockholm. it is concerns for the levels of pollution (rather than congestion) that have led to the introduction of the “Ecopass” scheme in 2008. Accordingly. in the following years the public debate has focused on the effectiveness of this pollution charge in reducing PM10 – a pollutant with adverse health impacts. Based on the analysis of media coverage and official reports. this paper argues that EU regulations had a crucial role in determining the newsworthiness of PM10 in Milan. Media and public concerns have then put increasing pressure on politicians to find a solution to the “emergency”. The dubious effectiveness of Ecopass in reducing PM10 levels then has had two kinds of consequences. First. the scheme was upgraded to a congestion charge in 2012. following the results of a bottom-up referendum in which a large majority of voters demanded both an upgrade and an extension of the Ecopass area: this stands in stark contrast with the experience of other cities. where voters have turned down charging schemes (e.g. Edinburgh. Manchester). Second. the new city administration has recently implemented a monitoring system for Black Carbon. a new PM metric that is more suitable to prove the effectiveness of traffic restrictions.

1205663,Household transport costs. economic stress and energy vulnerability,2018,Giulio Mattioli and Jean-Pierre Nicolas and Carsten Gertz,,Transport Policy,,,,Since the early 2000s issues of transport poverty and social exclusion have received increasing attention in transport studies (Dodson et al.. 2004; Hine and Mitchell. 2001; Lucas et al.. 2001). Although much of this research has focused on low-mobility and/or carless individuals. there has been growing awareness that the costs of daily mobility can have important economic stress impacts. In developed countries with high levels of car dependence. the costs of motoring can be burdensome. raising questions of affordability for households with limited economic resources. A number of developments in the first two decades of this century have contributed to raise the profile of household transport costs as a research topic and a policy concern. First. and more obviously. increasing and increasingly volatile global oil prices have raised concerns for the vulnerability of households to fuel price increases (Dodson and Sipe. 2007). Second. the rise of the climate change agenda has led to consider pricing measures as a key component of sustainable transport policy. Implementation of such measures however. has often been hampered by concerns for the distributional impacts of increasing transport costs faced by households. Third. the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 and its aftermath have highlighted broader issues of living standards. economic stress and affordability. which go beyond the specific case of transport. In this context. a further reason to investigate household transport costs has to do with other competing pressures on household budgets.,True,osb4TscAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,5,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01672810/,14396332587647945328,/scholar?cites=14396332587647945328,,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01672810/document,0,0,0

1205676,The Routledge Handbook of Energy Security,2010,BK Sovacool,,,,436,Routledge,"This Handbook examines the subject of energy security: its definition. dimensions. ways to measure and index it. and the complicating factors that are often overlooked. The volume identifies varying definitions and dimensions of energy security. including those that prioritize security of supply and affordability alongside those that emphasize availability. energy efficiency. trade. environmental quality. and social and political stewardship. It also explores the various metrics that can be used to give energy security more coherence. and also to enable it to be measured. including recent attempts to measure energy security progress at the national level. with a special emphasis placed on countries within the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). countries within Asia. and industrialized countries worldwide. This Handbook:• Broadens existing discussions of energy security that center on access to fuels. including"" oil security"" and"" coal security.""• Focuses not only on the supply side of energy but also the demand. taking a hard look at energy services and politics along with technologies and infrastructure;• Investigates energy security issues such as energy poverty. equity and access. and development;• Analyzes ways to index and measure energy security progress at the national and international level.

This study details how energy justice can serve as a novel conceptual tool for philosophers and ethicists that better integrates usually distinct distributive and procedural justice concerns. Energy justice serves as an important analytical tool for energy researchers striving to understand how values get built into energy systems or to resolve common energy problems. Energy justice presents a useful decision-making tool that can assist energy planners and consumers in making more informed energy choices.

It is demonstrated that. at a global level. economic growth is strongly correlated with environmental impacts. and barriers to fast decoupling are large and numerous. On the other hand. low or negative growth is highly correlated with increasing unemployment in most market economies. and strategies to change this lead to difficult questions and tradeoffs. The coexistence of these two correlations – which have rarely been studied together in the literature on “green growth”. “degrowth” and “a-growth” – justifies ambivalence about growth.

One particular rebound mechanism is re-spending of money savings associated with energy savings on energy intensive goods or services. We calculate the average magnitude of this “re-spending rebound” for different fuels and countries. and for both energy and carbon (CO2) emissions. We find that emerging economies. neglected in past studies. typically have larger rebounds than OECD countries. Since such economies play an increasingly important role in the global economy the re-spending rebound is a growing concern. The re-spending effect is generally larger for gasoline than for natural gas and electricity. Paradoxically. stronger financial incentives to conserve energy tend to increase the rebound.

To challenge the economic growth paradigm. the concept and term “degrowth” has recently been embraced by various activists and scholars. Drawing on a body of evidence from cognitive science. psychology. and related fields. we argue that using the word degrowth might be disadvantageous in public communications about alternatives to growth. We begin by reviewing arguments in favor of the term. Then we outline three main counterarguments: First. degrowth has a downward orientation which triggers negative initial feelings due to the basic conceptual metaphor “up is good—down is bad”.

Nonetheless. there is virtually unanimous support for growth in politics. This may partly be due to an assumed social consensus about the desirability of growth. Here we examine public perceptions relevant to the growth debate by using data from a large number of representative surveys conducted in Europe and the US.

Some believe green growth is an option. while others think climate goals are incompatible with growth. It does so by developing a sector-based approach to analyze the relation between on the one hand carbon dioxide emissions per dollar of output and on the other the growth in economic output and labor productivity. This allows us to investigate whether green growth – combining economic growth with environmental sustainability – is feasible. The analysis covers Denmark. Germany and Spain for the period 1995–2007. An important innovation of this study is that carbon intensity is calculated in two different ways: (1) as direct carbon dioxide emissions from each sector. which can be seen to immediately result from the processes in the respective sector; and (2) as total. direct plus indirect. emissions. by using …,True,OYzWWEUAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,34,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652616302992,4626905217168169258,/scholar?cites=4626905217168169258,,,0,0,0

However. it aims at changing behavior associated with carbon-intensive goods that are often subject to bounded rationality and social preferences. such as status and imitation. Here we use a macroeconomic multi-agent model with such features to test the effect of various policies on both environmental and economic performance. The model is particularly suitable to address distributional impacts of climate policies. not only because populations of many agents are included. but also as these are composed of different classes of households driven by specific motivations. We simulate various policy scenarios. combining in different ways a carbon tax. a reduction of labor taxes. subsidies for green innovation. a price subsidy to consumers for less carbon-intensive products. and green government procurement. The results show pronounced differences with those obtained by rational-agent model studies. It turns out that demand-oriented subsidies lead to lower unemployment and higher output. but perform less well in terms of carbon emissions.

1205718,Framing Fracking: Public responses to potential unconventional fossil fuel exploitation in the North of England,2014,LAURENCE WILLIAMS,,,,,,The emerging prospect of the exploitation of onshore unconventional fossil fuels (unconventionals) across the UK has been accompanied by a significant degree of public unease. Institutional actors have regularly claimed that the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing (fracking). the controversial technique often involved in the extraction of unconventionals. are safely manageable. Public concern over both the technique of fracking and the prospect of the exploitation of unconventionals has regularly been categorised by these institutional actors as being ostensibly about these risks. As a result sceptical public positions have often been represented as lacking (technical) understanding and as in need of being informed of “the facts”. This account of the controversy. regularly evident in media. expert. and political discourse. makes a series of questionable assumptions about public responses and is showing signs of a failure to learn lessons from previous instances of controversy surrounding emerging technological innovation. This research is an attempt to articulate the currently scarcely acknowledged factors underlying public concerns and a series of conditions upon which the ‘acceptability’ of fracking and unconventionals may rest. In order to do so a deliberative focus group methodology is employed. with an explicit focus on the framing of the issue. including institutional treatment of questions from beyond established scientific risk knowledge and often unquestioned normativities involved in nominally expert accounts.,True,6xdnkU0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,7,http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/9444,2323639826680414259,/scholar?cites=2323639826680414259,,http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/9444/1/Framing_Fracking_Complete_PDF.pdf,0,0,0

These lessons will prove valuable in relation to shale gas should the moratorium ever be lifted. but also offer broader insights into the politics of the environment and innovation. These insights relate especially to the infrastructure required as part of the UK’s net zero strategy. irrespective of UK shale policy going forward.This review takes the form of a brief history of the national formal politics of shale gas in the UK over the period 2009-2019. during which so much and yet so little occurred.

1205727,A definition of ‘carbon footprint’,2008,Thomas Wiedmann and Jan Minx,1,Ecological economics research trends,,1-11,Nova Science Publishers: Hauppauge. NY. USA,The term'carbon footprint'has become tremendously popular over the last few years and is now in widespread use across the media-at least in the United Kingdom. With climate change high up on the political and corporate agenda. carbon footprint calculations are in demand. Numerous approaches have been proposed to provide estimates. ranging from basic online calculators to sophisticated life-cycle-analysis or input-output based methods and tools. Despite its ubiquitous use however. there is an apparent lack of academic definitions of what exactly a'carbon footprint'is meant to be. The scientific literature is surprisingly void of clarifications. despite the fact that countless studies in energy and ecological economics that could have claimed to measure a'carbon footprint'have been published over decades. This commentary explores the apparent discrepancy between public and academic use of the term'carbon footprint'and suggests a scientific definition based on commonly accepted accounting principles and modelling approaches.

From 1990 to 2008 CO2 emissions in developed countries (defined as countries with emission-reduction commitments in the Kyoto Protocol.

Some studies suggest that the stabilization of emissions in developed countries was partially because of growing imports from developing countries. To quantify the growth in emission transfers via international trade. we developed a trade-linked global database for CO2 emissions covering 113 countries and 57 economic sectors from 1990 to 2008. We find that the emissions from the production of traded goods and services have increased from 4.3 Gt CO2 in 1990 (20% of global emissions) to 7.8 Gt CO2 in 2008 (26%).

We use structural decomposition analysis to identify the drivers for China’s emission growth between 1992 and 2007. with special focus on the period 2002 to 2007 when growth was most rapid. In contrast to previous analysis. we find that efficiency improvements have largely offset additional CO2 emissions from increased final consumption between 2002 and 2007.

Here we review ten pathways for the utilization of carbon dioxide. Pathways that involve chemicals. fuels and microalgae might reduce emissions of carbon dioxide but have limited potential for its removal. whereas pathways that involve construction materials can both utilize and remove carbon dioxide. Land-based pathways can increase agricultural output and remove carbon dioxide. Our assessment suggests that each pathway could scale to over 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide utilization annually.

1205743,Understanding Changes in the UK’s CO2 Emissions: A Global Perspective,2010,Giovanni Baiocchi and Jan C Minx,44,,4,1177-1184,American Chemical Society,The UK appears to be a leading country in curbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Unlike many other developed countries. it has already met its Kyoto obligations and defined ambitious. legally binding targets for the future. Recently this achievement has been called into question as it ignores rapidly changing patterns of production and international trade. We use structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to investigate the drivers behind annual changes in CO2 emission from consumption in the UK between 1992 and 2004. In contrast with previous SDA-based studies. we apply the decomposition to a global. multiregional input−output model (MRIO). which accounts for UK imports from all regions and uses region-specific production structures and CO2 intensities. We find that improvements from “domestic” changes in efficiency and production structure led to a 148 Mt reduction in CO2 emissions. which only …,True,-BA3AagAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,180,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es902662h,9505974536253336271,/scholar?cites=9505974536253336271,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es902662h,0,0,0

Alternative fuels and technologies have been promoted as a means for reducing the carbon intensity of the transport sector.

This study investigates the distributional effects of climate change taxes on households belonging to different income and lifestyle groups; and it compares the effects of a CO2 tax with a multiple GHG tax in the UK in terms of cost efficiency and distributional effects.Results show that a multi GHG tax is more efficient than a CO2 tax due to lower marginal abatement costs. and that both taxes are regressive. with lower income households paying a relatively larger share of their income for the taxes than higher income households. A shift from a CO2 tax to a GHG tax will reduce and shift the tax burden between consumption categories such as from energy-intensive products to food products.

Integrating human behavior into formal Earth system models (ESMs). however. requires crucial modeling assumptions about actors and their goals. behavioral options. and decision rules. as well as modeling decisions regarding human social interactions and the aggregation of individuals' behavior. Here. we review existing modeling approaches and techniques from various disciplines and schools of thought dealing with human behavior at different levels of decision making. We demonstrate modelers' often vast degrees of freedom but also seek to make modelers aware of the often crucial consequences of seemingly innocent modeling assumptions. After discussing which socioeconomic units are potentially important for ESMs. we compare models of individual decision making that correspond to alternative behavioral theories and that make diverse modeling assumptions about individuals' preferences. beliefs. decision rules. and foresight.

In this paper. we combine Markov chain analysis and complex network methods to identify regimes of land-cover dynamics from land-cover maps (TerraClass) derived from high-resolution (30 m) satellite imagery. We estimate regional transition probabilities between different land-cover types and use clustering analysis and community detection algorithms on similarity networks to explore patterns of dominant land-cover transitions. We find that land-cover transition probabilities in the Brazilian Amazon are heterogeneous in space. and adjacent subregions tend to be assigned to the same clusters. When focusing on transitions from single land-cover types. we uncover patterns that reflect major regional differences in land-cover dynamics.

We review the theoretical framework of Piketty and the responses his work received in the economics community. both mainstream and heterodox. We argue that Piketty's theory remains ambiguous.

The method combines three approaches from statistical physics:(a) moment closure.(b) pair approximation of adaptive network processes. and (c) thermodynamic limit of the resulting stochastic process. As an example of use. we develop a stochastic agent-based model with heterogeneous households that invest in either a fossil-fuel-or renewables-based sector while allocating labor on a competitive market. Using the adaptive voter model. the model describes agents as social learners that interact on a dynamic network. We apply the approximation methods to derive a set of ordinary differential equations that approximate the macrodynamics of the model.

Deforestation of tropical forests threatens the stability of species-rich ecosystems. local weather patterns. and global climate. The three main parts of the thesis study different aspects of this topic using concepts from theoretical physics and network theory. The first part reviews modeling approaches to human decision making and behavior. From the review. networked agent-based models emerge as promising tools to capture the dynamics of social-ecological systems such as the land system. The second part of the thesis combines Markov-chain and cluster analyses to detect patterns in satellite-derived land-cover maps of the Brazilian Amazon. I compute transition rates between different land-cover types and apply clustering algorithms to find spatial patterns. The analysis shows that neighboring subregions undergo similar transitions and identifies clusters corresponding to findings from field surveys. Markov-chain models. parameterized with the transition rates. are used to compute land-cover projections. In the third part. I develop an agent-based model to investigate under which conditions the intensification of cattle ranching can reduce deforestation in the Amazon. The model captures stylized environmental. economic. as well as social processes. and uses heuristic decision theory to represent different land management strategies. A detailed analysis reveals that fast intensification can only lower deforestation rates if local cattle markets saturate.

We compare the results with reduction requirements implied by globally cost-effective mitigation scenarios and official Chinese policy targets. For the years 1971–2000 we find that the impact of high economic growth on emissions was partially compensated by a steady fall in energy intensity. However. the end – and even reversal – of this downward trend. along with a rising carbon intensity of energy. resulted in rapid emission growth during 2000–2007.

While proponents of the former approach claim that environmental measures can promote growth by. for example. more efficient use of natural resources. proponents of the latter maintain that environmental integrity can only be upheld by slowing down growth. This paper argues that both approaches constitute inadequate foundations for public policy as they fail to appropriately conceptualize social welfare. We show how policy aimed at social welfare can be understood as managing a portfolio of capital stocks. some of which exhibit the characteristics of ‘commons’ (i.e. common pool resources and public goods).

Consumption-based pricing of emissions—which could in practice be implemented with a full border tax adjustment (BTA)—has been forwarded as an option to increase the effectiveness of unilateral climate policy. This paper questions the economic rationale behind this approach. using a theoretical  trade model in which leakage occurs through terms-of-trade effects. We show analytically. first. that consumption-based pricing of emissions does not necessarily result in less leakage than production-based policies.

Significant emission transfers from developing countries to developed countries in the form of emissions embodied in trade have been interpreted as an indication of such leakage. To reduce leakage and provide an appropriate picture of countries’ responsibility for global emissions. an alternative proposal is to attribute emissions on the basis of consumption instead of production. However. as one unit of imported emissions generally cannot be equated with a corresponding increase in emissions released to the atmosphere. putting a price on emissions embodied in imports equal to the social cost of these emissions (e.g.. by means of consumption-based emission pricing) is not an optimal policy.

Standard game-theoretic models that describe climate change mitigation as a public good problem predict few incentives for individual countries to act. Nevertheless – despite the absence of a globally binding agreement – we can observe some developing countries launching unilateral climate policies. Being one of th\ose. Vietnam has recently announced to strive for a low-carbon economy.

Inc.,Avoiding dangerous climate changes requires emission reductions in not only industrialized but also developing countries. This opinion piece argues that even if the ‘full incremental costs’ of abatement in developing countries would be covered by industrialized countries. the former's development prospects could be hampered by climate change mitigation due to the following reasons. First. financial inflows have the potential to induce a ‘climate finance curse’ similar to adverse effects related to natural resource exports. Second. increased use of more expensive low‐carbon energy sources could delay structural change and the build‐up of physical infrastructure. Third. higher energy prices could have negative effects on poverty and inequality.

In this way. emission pricing could promote sustainable socio-economic development by safeguarding the stability of natural systems which constitute the material basis of economies. while at the same time providing public goods that are essential for human well-being.

Benefits are expected from efficiency gains and the alleviation of concerns over competitiveness. However. from trade-theory it is known that due to general equilibrium effects and market distortions. linking may not always be beneficial for all participating countries. Following-up on this debate. we use a Ricardo-Viner type general equilibrium model to study the implications of sectoral linking on carbon emissions (‘leakage’). competitiveness. and welfare. By comparing pre- and post-linking equilibria. we show analytically how global emissions can increase if one of the ‘linked’ countries lacks an economy-wide emissions cap. although in case of a link across idiosyncratic sectors a decrease of emissions (‘anti-leakage’) is also possible.

The way this relation impacts our approach to energy transition is a current issue for research. Implementing renewable energy sources in built-up areas challenges incumbent supply chains and large technical systems. especially for electricity. gas and heat. Approaches to transition such as the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) highlight the transformation of socio-technical regimes but have been criticised for overstating stability of regime and for overlooking spatial (and consequently urban) processes.

Ces barrières bio-physiques créent des tensions entre acteurs de la forêt et de l'énergie pour ce qui concerne les modèles d'approvisionnement à privilégier: d'un côté. les acteurs forestiers prônent de petites chaufferies consommant la ressource locale en quantités modérées. quand les acteurs issus de l'énergie préfèrent de grandes chaufferies. nécessitant un plus long transport de la ressource pour réaliser des économies d'échelle.

Recently. they have begun to challenge the idea that renewable energies were naturally associated with more democratic political ideals. Building on these developments and on the premise that (renewable) energy resources are not simply given as such by nature. the chapter proposes a framework to explore the material assemblage of energy resources in four different cases–wind. solar. biomass energy and distributed load shedding. Importantly. the chapter points out the diverse ways in which these resources are assembled and highlights the related political effects. It shows that the democratic dimension of renewable energies should not be regarded as one of their inherent attributes. but as a possibility that depends on their socio-material assemblage.,True,-S5iMNkAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,0,https://jeannicod.ccsd.cnrs.fr/EHESS/halshs-01675678v1,,,,,0,0,0

Pour comprendre les liens qui unissent la forêt aux lieux il faut se référer aux travaux qui se sont centrés ces dernières années sur une approche analytique des « ressources territoriales ». Selon cette proposition. les ressources sont créées en réponse aux enjeux de développement (Colletis et Pecqueur 1993. 1995). Cette approche s’appuie sur la distinction entre. d’une part. des ressources qui forment un potentiel à révéler ou à organiser (par exemple un paysage forestier). et d’autre part. les actifs qui sont des facteurs en activité (une filière forêt-bois). Par ailleurs. une seconde distinction oppose d’une part les « ressources génériques ». susceptibles d’être transférées (délocalisées) et dont la valeur est indépendante de leur participation au processus de production (par exemple le bois évalué à son cours international). et d’autre part les « ressources spécifiques » dont la valeur résulte explicitement de logiques de différenciation (des essences particulières valorisées en tant que telles. des bois de gros diamètre permettant de faire des produits spécifiques qu’on ne peut pas faire ailleurs). Cette seconde distinction se fonde sur les travaux qui soulignent le lien inextricable entre la ressource et son territoire (Colletis et Pecqueur 2004 ; Gumuchian et Pecqueur 2007).,True,-S5iMNkAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,0,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01451136/,,,,,0,0,0

Ces évolutions sont liées à deux crises majeures: le changement climatique et ses impacts sur notre civilisation et la hausse des prix de l’énergie. Pris ensemble. ils constituent un défi de coordination fondamental. En effet. pour sortir de la crise énergétique–ou en retarder l’apparition–il serait aisé de simplement recourir au charbon. par exemple. mais en raison des effets locaux et sur les émissions de gaz à effets de serre. la transition énergétique vise au passage aux énergies renouvelables qui nécessiteront le stockage d’électricité ou de chaleur pour leur développement à grande échelle.En effet. ceux-ci pourraient contribuer à la stabilité des réseaux. au lissage de pointe et à compenser le prix élevé de l’énergie lors de ces pointes qui sont enfin également liées au recours aux énergies fossiles pour faire face à la demande.

Temporary drops in the spot price of electricity now occur in Europe when peak solar and wind output coincides with slack demand. Management of intermittent energy sources and energy storage are consequently crucial issues for the medium term. Two possible routes are of particular importance: on the one hand. funding of generating capacity  – via a market instrument yet to be devised – to cover only periods of peak demand and intermittent supply; on the other temporary demand-side management of end-users. These two routes have been studied in detail by energy actors and encouraged by public-sector sponsorship of research. But they have so far made no allowance for local authorities. resident groups and intermediate bodies. despite the fact that they are playing an increasingly important part in deploying renewables and achieving greater energy efficiency. Being more complex than commercial transactions. the relations between the various actors have given rise to sharply divergent analysis by different disciplines.  The socio-technical approach – a current of thought in the social sciences – has largely demonstrated the links between technology and society: the effect of institutional regulation on energy governance (Poupeau. 2013) and the deployment of technical systems (Berkhout et al. 2004; Geels and Schot. 2007); the organization of large technical networks and its subsequent dependence paths (Coutard. 2002); the enmeshing of town planning and networks (Dupuy et al. 2008; Rutherford and Coutard. 2014 …,True,-S5iMNkAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,0,https://hal.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/hal-01273648,,,,https://hal.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/hal-01273648/document,0,0,0

1205827,Spatial processes in urban energy transitions: considering an assemblage of Socio-Energetic Nodes,2016,Gilles Debizet and Antoine Tabourdeau and Caroline Gauthier and Philippe Menanteau,,Journal of Cleaner Production,1,,,Urban and energy transitions are increasingly seen as being deeply intertwined. The way this relation impacts our approach to energy transition is a current issue for research. Implementing renewable energy sources in built-up areas challenges incumbent supply chains and large technical systems. especially for electricity. gas and heat. Approaches to transition such as the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) highlight the transformation of socio-technical regimes but have been criticised for overstating stability of regime and for overlooking spatial (and consequently urban) processes. Other concepts are required in order to understand local and non-local relationships between niches and regimes. This paper suggests a constructivist and pragmatic concept for urban energy transition. the Socio-Energetic Node (SEN). thanks to which actors and artefacts can be traced within energy networks.

The main problem is not a lack of energy-efficient technologies. which do indeed exist for electrical appliances. but one of slow diffusion of existing technologies due to the weakness of the price signal and the purchasing behaviour of consumers. In association with energy labelling. minimum energy performance standards have proved to be very effective in stimulating technological progress and organising market transformation.

However. in most countries of the world the use of SWH remains limited.The first programmes to promote SWH systems were introduced for reasons of energy security and to save on oil costs. Even though these reasons are still valid today. they now take second place behind other concerns: serving areas with insufficient energy supplies. reducing peak power loads. harnessing a country’s own resources and protecting the environment.

1205833,Carbon taxation: a tale of three countries,2019,Patrick Criqui and Mark Jaccard and Thomas Sterner,11,Sustainability,22,6280,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Carbon pricing is considered by most economists as a central dimension to any climate policy. It is assumed to bring simple. transparent. and cost-effective means to change investment and consumption behaviors. The most straightforward method is carbon taxation. but its implementation is more complex. This study provides a comparative analysis of carbon taxation in three countries—Sweden. Canada. and France—aimed at drawing lessons for the future of carbon taxation. Comparing the experience of the three countries reveals that carbon taxes. once in place. do have the intended effect. In this sense. they work well. However. the analysis also reveals very different situations in terms of advances. difficulties. and results. which highlights the need to carefully consider the social and political conditions for the acceptance and effective implementation of such economic instruments. Against this background. the comparative analysis yields four main insights that deserve further research from economics and social scientists: the ability to combine pure economic instruments and other regulation or policies and measures; the management of lobbies and vested interests; the identification of a clear strategy for the recycling of the carbon revenues. whether earmarked or not; and finally. the importance of these three dimensions of carbon taxes in the new settings of zero net emission policies.

1205834,Prices versus quantities: Environmental policies for promoting the development of renewable energy,2001,Philippe Menanteau and Dominique Finon and Marie-Laure Lamy,,,,,Institut d'économie et de politique de l'énergie,Now that the risks of climate change have been confirmed and the European States have declared their willingness to pursue ambitious objectives for producing electricity from renewable energy sources. it becomes crucial to take a look at the relative efficiency of the different incentive schemes used. Such schemes may focus on quantities–defining national targets and setting up bidding systems. or quota systems providing for green certificate trading-. or they may focus on prices-fixed feed-in tariffs. Clearly. these instruments are much the same as those used in environmental policies. with similar discussion involved in their choice. Whatever the system chosen. the role of the public authorities is quite specific: to stimulate technical progress and speed up the technological learning processes so that ultimately renewable energy technologies will be able to compete with conventional technologies. once the environmental costs have been internalised. A comparison of instruments must thus take into account the characteristics of the innovation process and adoption conditions–uncertainties regarding cost curves. learning effects–which means also looking at dynamic efficiency criteria.The authors examine the efficiency of the different incentive schemes for the development of renewable energy sources. both from a theoretical point of view by comparing price-based approaches with quantity-based approaches. and from a practical point of view by looking at concrete examples of how these different instruments have been implemented.

Dans cette logique. quand bien même des entreprises parviennent. pour certains produits. à «découpler» la quantité produite des volumes de ressources (matière et énergie) nécessaires en phase de production. de nombreux autres aspects jouent dans le sens d’un accroissement important des consommations physiques. Pour une entreprise. la croissance de ses marchés va de paire avec l’accroissement des unités produites. en lien avec l’accélération de l’obsolescence de ses produits. Cette obsolescence est fréquemment «programmée». soit en influant sur la durée de vie matérielle de produits que l’on conçoit pour ne plus être réparables. soit en stimulant le consommateur afin qu’il s’ équipe des dernières innovations. peu de celles-ci constituant des innovations radicales répondant à de nouveaux besoins et/ou usages.Du point de vue du développement durable. l’accélération d’un tel phénomène est excessivement dommageable. Cela est manifeste d’un point de vue environnemental bien entendu (changement climatique. pollutions directes et/ou indirectes liées aux substances et matériaux employés.…). mais également d’un point de vue économique. avec l’inévitable raréfaction de certaines ressources non renouvelables et le risque. bien réel. d’aborder les décennies à venir en situation de pénurie. situation mise aux oubliettes depuis plus d’un siècle dans les …,True,IUWWTTcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,55,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00129110/,16927306013460493709,/scholar?cites=16927306013460493709,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/12/91/10/PDF/eco_de_fonctionnalite.pdf,0,0,0

1205852,Municipal waste management in Europe: European policy between harmonisation and subsidiarity,2002,Nicolas Buclet,11,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Nicolas Buclet Waste management issues can be approached in several ways. The question of which treatment technique to adopt is essentially a downstream problem. In our view the issue needed to be tackled further upstream. Waste management is not only a technical problem. it is also an area which involves various actors throughout society. In this book. as in the previous volume (Buclet. Godard. 2000). the organisation of waste management is seen in terms of regimes. A regime is an entire form ofinstitutional. technical. economic and social organisation relating to a specific field. no matter how complex that field is. Regime formation is generally a long-drawn-out process. rooted in the multiple interactions of the actors involved. Legislation plays a crucial role but would not. of itself. lead to the formation of a regime. There is always the old question of causality and which element occurs first: the behaviour of actors who constitute the reality. or the legislation that models their behaviour? Besides legislation. other formal or informal conventions influence the behaviour of actors approaching a common path. making co ordination easier between them. In this book we have insisted on conventional principles. They are the real guides for actors within each national regime.,True,IUWWTTcAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,38,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=zK9zm9M-n-AC&oi=fnd&pg=PA2&dq=info:LfCIbgy4zY8J:scholar.google.com&ots=wIF8-Vv9eo&sig=5etF8f1aXkFZHS0yHZRhx3h1d0s,10362140681182965805,/scholar?cites=10362140681182965805,,,0,0,0

The economics of conventions is used as an analytical framework through which to demonstrate the conflict between the dominant conventions underpinning societal development and the objectives of sustainable development. It suggests that a trajectory towards the objectives of sustainable development should be managed through a reflexion concerning the conventional principles required to be adopted in order to favour the emergence of a new conventional regime. The principles of proximity. the increase in individual and collective capabilities. and participative democracy are presented as possible principles that could be adopted in order to favour the emergence of a new conventional regime.,True,IUWWTTcAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,25,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10668-014-9539-4,4334590752563639645,/scholar?cites=4334590752563639645,,,0,0,0

The majority of Member State waste management regimes have shifted from policies based on the control of waste disposal activities. to include goals for waste prevention and recovery. 1 This trend builds on the rationale of protection of human health and the environment. to include resource efficiency and the need for an upstream approach to waste management through a life cycle perspective. Despite increasing attempts to harmonize waste policy objectives at the European level. national waste policies (especially those affecting packaging waste) differ noticeably. These differences are reflected in national waste management objectives. organizational solutions. and technical choices for end-of-life treatment. The need to harmonize European waste policies has been raised. as disproportionate polices created by different rules and conventions of Member States have led to externalities and disturbances in European waste management. These include obstacles such as waste tourism and barriers to free trade. 2 However. while there is a need for each Member State to develop its own policies for meeting European Union (EU) targets. there is also the possibility that a lack of consistency among approaches can lead to increased negative externalities between national regimes. ultimately leading to a potential negative impact upon both free trade and environmental protection. 3Plastic production has grown from 1.5 million tonnes in 1950. to an all-time high of 260 million tonnes in 2007. 4 Industry demand for these materials has remained relatively constant …,True,IUWWTTcAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,22,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:488367,12559075872425433330,/scholar?cites=12559075872425433330,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:488367/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

Our object of study will be limited to household waste. which is by far the main category of municipal waste.2 French household waste policy has undergone important changes since 1992. Current legislation tends to promote valorisation3 modes and to limit elimination (landfilling. incineration without energy recovery). This new regime is led by a bottom-up approach. National authorities play a role of orientation. without specifying neither the valorisation techniques to use. nor precise targets to attain. In this approach. municipalities are responsible for the translation of general orientations into technical trajectories. The sum of each local decision regarding the adoption of valorisation techniques will. therefore. depend upon the achievement of national objectives.

Quels sont les conflits entre la population et les décideurs? Comment les anticiper? Quels sont les leviers économiques? Comment intégrer les progrès sanitaires et environnementaux? Une historienne de l’environnement. un urbaniste. un toxicologue et un ingénieur économiste répondent au questionnement des décideurs. Les techniques de gestion des déchets ménagers et les réglementations sont décrites en France et en Europe du Nord. et les coûts sont évalués et reliés au financement du service par la tarification incitative. Mais la gestion des déchets ménagers renvoie également aux modes de consommation. au devenir des biens usagés. aux impacts sur le milieu naturel et la santé publique. L’histoire de la gestion des déchets et l’analyse des risques sanitaires complètent ce panorama et l’exemple de la crise de la dioxine (1989-2000) montre la difficulté chronique à anticiper une crise sanitaire et à en accepter la dimension sociale.

The exponents of the GTOs are optimized using the method of Nestmann and Peyerimhoff [J. Phys. B 23 (1990) L773]. The appended module NUMCBAS provides the numerical Bessel and Coulomb functions required as input for the program.

This paper deals with the calculation of rate coefficients for rotational excitation of the HCN and HNC molecules in their ground vibrational state in collision with He. Calculations of pure rotational (de-)excitation cross-sections of HCN and HNC by He were performed using the essentially exact close-coupling method. Cross-sections for transitions among the 26 first rotational levels of HCN and HNC were calculated for energies up to 3500 cm−1. These cross-sections were used to determine collisional rate constants for temperatures ranging from 5 to 500 K. The propensity rules of both collisional systems are discussed.

It is also required for a detailed understanding of important astrophysical processes. namely. the collisional excitation of water. including the pumping of water masers and the formation of molecular hydrogen on icy interstellar dust grains.

Using a 1-D radiative transfer model. we derive the abundances in the envelopes. In two sources of the sample. the observations can only be reproduced by the model if the methanol abundance is enhanced by about two order of magnitude in the inner hot region of the envelope. Two other sources show similar jumps. although at a lower confidence level. The observations for the other three sources are well reproduced with a constant abundance. but the presence of a jump cannot be ruled out. The observed methanol abundances in the warm gas around low mass protostars are orders of magnitude higher than gas phase chemistry models predict. Hence. in agreement with other evidence. this suggests that the high methanol abundance reflects recent evaporation of ices due to the heating by the newly formed star.

Once properly collected. it can provide a  useful supplementary water resource for plants and humans.  I ts production can be significantly improved  by using specific materials and particular geometry. In this context. new shapes for dew collectors are  presented and their water yields are compared with those of a 1 m 2 .  30° . inclined planar condenser used  as a standard. The experiments were carried out in Pess ac (SW France). situated about 45 km from the  Atlantic Ocean. during summer and fall 2009. In addition to conical shapes. which have 30 % larger yields  than the planar reference condenser and whose functioning was simulated numerically. two new families  of forms are considered: egg - box and origami types. The egg - box shape yields 9 % more water as  compared to the reference planar condenser. a result nearly independent of the dew yield. In contrast. the  origami shape gives yields 150 % larger than the referen ce planar condenser for events with high dew  volumes and can show 400 % greater yields for low dew volumes. These results are analysed and  discussed in terms of (i) radiative effects correlated with the angular variation of sky emissivity.

Technique de représentation autant que pratique de terrain. le transect est aujourd’hui revisité. Pour nous. il se présente comme un dispositif hybride entre la coupe technique et le parcours sensible : il se construit par le dessin. la photo. la mesure. le texte ou la vidéo. autant qu’il se pratique in situ. par la perception. la parole. la déambulation. en général par la marche. Réhabilitant de fait la dimension atmosphérique dans les représentations urbaines. rendant possible l’inscription de récits habitants dans les débats spécialisés entre disciplines. le transect devient un outil d’interrogation et d’expression de l’espace sensible et des pratiques vécues. Comme tel le transect permet d'articuler deux postures habituellement dissociées. celles de l'analyse et de la conception. S'il emprunte à l’inventaire sa capacité à repérer et collecter les situations les plus différentes. s'il renvoie aux atlas Mnemosynes d’Aby Warburg et au paradigme indiciaire de Carlos Ginzburg. le passage du plan à la coupe permet de déployer la ville dans son épaisseur sociale. environnementale. historique et projectuelle.

Depending on the weather conditions and  the surface characteristics. the water yield can give up to 0.7 litres per  square meter and per night. Although the collection of rain water on roof turns out to be relatively  simple. dew harvesting needs a more sophisticated architectural design  to be efficient. Then this project aims at testing roof designs that improve  dew water recovery by modulating two major parameters related to its  recovery: (i) surface quality (strong emissivity. wetting character. low heat  capacity). (ii) the shape of the roof (slopes. orientations with respect to  dominant wind. gravity-induced water flow. etc.). A first step was the exploration of urban structures/sculptures. which  was carried out by numerical works and small scale modelling (workshop  held on December. 2008). In a second time (April. 2008). three roof  prototypes on scale 1:1 of approximately 4  m 2 each are constructed and  tested. These prototypes are designed with metals (sets of oriented plane  surfaces). resins (modular plays of crooked surfaces) and textile (stretched  structures).

Optimization is performed using Dynamic Programming and is compared with a simple ruled-based management.

A home automation system controlling household energy is proposed. It is decomposed into three layers: anticipation. reactive and device layers. This paper deals with an anticipation layer that allocates energy by taking into account predicted events. It consists in computing both the starting times of some services and in determining set points of others while satisfying the maximal power constraint. A constraint satisfaction problem formulation has been proposed. Because the complexity is NP-hard. a tabu search is used to solve the problem. It maximizes user comfort and minimizes energy cost.

1205926,A prediction system for home appliance usage,2013,Kaustav Basu and Lamis Hawarah and Nicoleta Arghira and Hussein Joumaa and Stephane Ploix,67,,,668-679,Elsevier,Power management in homes and offices requires appliance usage prediction when the future user requests are not available. The randomness and uncertainties associated with an appliance usage make the prediction of appliance usage from energy consumption data a non-trivial task. A general model for prediction at the appliance level is still lacking. This work proposes to improve learning algorithms with expert knowledge and proposes a general model using a knowledge driven approach to forecast if a particular appliance will start during a given hour or not. The approach is both a knowledge driven and data driven one. The overall energy management for a house requires that the prediction is done for the next 24 h in the future. The proposed model is tested over the IRISE data and using different machine learning algorithms.

Set-membership methods are a promising approach to fault detection because they take into account a priori knowledge of model uncertainties and measurement errors. Every uncertain model parameter and/or measurement is represented by a bounded variable. In this paper. detection consists of verifying the membership of measurements to an interval. First order discrete time models are used and their output is explicitly computed with interval arithmetic. Fault isolation relies on a causal analysis and the exoneration principle. which allows focusing the consistency tests on simple local models. The isolation strategy consists of two steps: performing minimal tests found with the causal graph and determining on line additional relevant tests that reduce the final diagnosis …,True,qoql0wMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,101,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109804001967,14997824754623465282,/scholar?cites=14997824754623465282,,,0,0,0

Nous défendons la thèse selon laquelle les approches bornées sont les mieux adaptées à la synthèse de procédure automatique de diagnostic s'appliquant aux systèmes physiques réels. À partir d'un raisonnement conceptuel. nous avons établi de manière univoque la problématique du diagnostic et montrer que toute procédure de diagnostic procède nécessairement de tests de cohérence. Nous avons montré que. dans un contexte incertain. les modèles contenant des variables bornées répondent tout à fait aux objectifs du diagnostic. Un formalisme permettant d'appréhender les propriétés des variables bornées est présenté ainsi qu'une procédure analytique conduisant aux caractéristiques d'un domaine défini par un champ vectoriel. Après avoir étudié différentes structures d'incertitudes. nous présentons un algorithme de caractérisation dont l'objectif est d'estimer les caractéristiques des incertitudes.

After 7 years of one of the highest feed-in tariffs in the world. the installed capacity in France is still very low. This is notably due to a diffuse pattern of administrative landscape protection which impacts on the construction of wind power potential. In turn. the pace of wind power development can be understood only by looking in more detail at the way in which landscape is dealt with in local planning processes. This paper examines the question using the case of Aveyron in southern France. We follow the shifting ways in which landscape is enrolled in wind power planning. in a context where new planning instruments favor an incipient decentralization in wind power policy.

Southern France,2010,Alain Nadaï and Olivier Labussière,35,Landscape Research,2,209-233,Routledge,Landscape and birds are an important cause of blocking wind power projects. This paper investigates the question of whether birds and wind power can be part of a same landscape and what type of landscape this could compose. We do so by following birds. birdwatchers and wind power developers in their attempt to compose such a landscape in the South of France. Our perspective focuses on the attachments that animals or landscape might develop or entice humans to develop. We show that the process by which such a wind power landscape is composed engages birds into successive translations. which ultimately translate bird intelligence in composing with the wind into a quality of the landscape. As a result. such a landscape emerges from a net of relations and has a quality which is not necessarily visually readable: it is accountable to the entities which have been brought into representation …,True,MyfBQ4QAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,36,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01426390903557964,7082094107580863984,/scholar?cites=7082094107580863984,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00470651/file/Birds_LR_v11_final.pdf,0,0,0

By ‘innovative’. we mean that planners' decisions relate to the site/situation which they aim to transform rather than to preexisting norms or abstract territorial representations. as is so often the case in wind power planning processes. This planning process has a direct consequence: it succeeds in taking into account the existing local landscape and in engaging it in a transformative process. Drawing upon Deleuze's and Guattari's concepts of ‘map’/‘tracing’. and on Deleuze's concept of ‘sign’. we follow the way in which landscape is circulated in this process and analyse the relational properties of the graphic representations which underlie it.

The politicization of wind power generates new ad hoc collectives. In the French case. because of the institutional framing resulting from landscape and wind power policies (centralization. feed-in tariffs. private developers). collectives of emerging wind power landscapes are regularly set apart from wind power planning processes. This paper explores the extent to which these recompositions and new collectives could be part of emerging wind power potentials. The empirical evidence stemming from our case studies shows that wind power technology. like any other technology. is not endowed with a potential per se. Wind power potentials differ – ‘capitalistic’. ‘controversial’. ‘negotiated’. ‘conditional’ – depending on planning processes and inherited configurations.

1205957,Acceptabilité sociale et planification territoriale. éléments de réflexion à partir de l'éolien et du stockage du CO2,2010,Alain Nadaï and Olivier Labussière,,,,45-60,quae,En moins de trente ans. le changement climatique d'origine anthropique est devenu un enjeu scientifique et géopolitique majeur. En 2002. les pays de l'Union Européenne ratifient le protocole de Kyoto et se fixent l'objectif de ramener. en 2012. leurs émissions de gaz à effet de serre 8 % en dessous des niveaux de 1990. Les Etats s'appuient très largement sur les énergies renouvelables et de façon encore expérimentale sur le stockage du CO2 pour réduire leurs émissions. L'acceptabilité sociale de ces nouvelles technologies est souvent délicate en raison des recompositions territoriales et paysagères qu'elles provoquent. Pour éclairer la question de l'acceptabilité. cet article s'appuie sur la distinction entre la technologie générique et territorialisée (Nadaï. à paraître). Parler de technologie générique consiste à concevoir son potentiel. c'est-à-dire ses capacités de développement. comme un attribut intrinsèque et son déploiement comme un processus s'élaborant à distance du social. Cette vision tend à confondre le territoire avec l'espace quasi-isotropique de leur gisement (vent. caractéristiques géologiques) et à mettre les enjeux d'acceptabilité sociale et de régulation territoriale du côté des contraintes. En abordant le cas de l'éolien et du stockage du CO2. cet article analyse l'écart entre une technologie générique et une technologie territorialisée. Cette alternative peut éclairer les enjeux contemporains en montrant que le potentiel d'une technologie n'est pas un donné mais qu'il reste à construire en fonction de processus d'exploration du social déterminant pour son acceptabilité.,True,MyfBQ4QAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,20,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00562042/,2938936213840340715,/scholar?cites=2938936213840340715,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00562042/file/Nadai_LabussiA_re_Planification_et_acceptabilitA_sociale_le_cas_de_l_A_olien_en_France_v2.pdf,0,0,0

Attentif à la pensée de Gilles Deleuze. il réinvestit l’idée que la perception comme activité de connaissance est sous-tendue par un mode de compréhension esthétique : la recognition prend appui sur un sensible qui peut à tout moment lui échapper et engager une saisie du milieu urbain selon une direction qui n’est plus conceptuelle. Nous caractérisons ce processus grâce aux notions de mesure et de rythme. en arguant du fait qu’à tous moments le rythme peut échapper à la mesure et alimenter une perception qui n’est plus constituante et formelle mais proliférante et pré-formelle. Ces catégories (mesure et rythme) nous permettent de décrire et d’analyser des processus d’éclatement de la synthèse perceptive. correspondant par hypothèse à une saisie du milieu urbain d’après ses ambiances et ses allures plutôt que par ses formes et ses structures. L’ambiance urbaine n’est donc pas un donné : elle n’appartient ni au sujet. ni à l’objet mais elle se singularise par l’émergence d’un impensable du sensible dans la pensée. À ce niveau. l’urbain ne livre pas de significations explicites mais les signes d’une réalité complexe. non directement intelligible. dont il reste à inventer les codes pour s’en saisir.

En première partie. en nous appuyant sur Kant. nous proposons que les stratégies esthétiques modifient les modes d’appréhension du milieu et favorisent sa prise en compte en aménagement. Plutôt que la notion de controverse. cette approche est mise en valeur à travers la notion de mésentente. proposée par J. Rancière. Il apparaît. avec la contestation du projet THT en Quercy Blanc. que les stratégies esthétiques contribuent à la reconnaissance des qualités du milieu par l’aménagement mais qu’elles se heurtent au contenu normatif de sa méthodologie de projet. Sommes-nous prisonnier d’un écart insurmontable entre la lecture esthétique du milieu et l’univers normatif de l’action? En seconde partie. nous avançons que l’aménagement peut tirer partie du milieu à condition de trouver une méthode prospective qui le conjecture comme un potentiel. La symptomatologie deleuzienne nous permet d’approcher l’aménagement. non plus par sa capacité normative et anticipatrice à arrêter le sens des choses. mais comme l’art d’expérimenter de nouvelles possibilités d’existence. En étudiant deux exemples de planification éolienne (Aveyron et Aude). il apparaît que si l’aménagement considère le milieu comme le lieu de validation d’une rationalité pratique. sa maîtrise du développement éolien est faible.

We follow the progressive emergence and structuring of a so-called “opponent” network to a highly conflictual wind power project (Seine-et-Marne. Parisian basin. France). paying particular attention to the shared landscape resources engaged in the development of this project.The paper draws on various strands of literature interested in landscape as a socio-material assemblage. a commons as a collective management of shared resources. and issues such as a political articulation of matters of public concern.Our case study suggests that local opposition to wind power is symptomatic of the shortcomings of French institutions’ treatment of the shared resources engaged in the development of wind power projects.

1205968,Exhaustible-renewable wind power,2017,Alain Nadaï and Olivier Labussière,,,,306-329,Routledge,Policy debates concerning the development of non-fossil energies have mostly been framed in technological terms. letting us believe that if we were to address and solve technological issues. alternative energy patterns would be at hand. Within this technological rhetoric. natural entities such as wind or solar radiation. which are commonly conceived as potential renewable energy resources. have been quantitatively measured and mapped so as to assess the related technological potentials–eg wind power or solar PV production potentials (GWh or GW). As emphasised quite a while ago by Shove (1998). this way of approaching energy issues casts a singular perspective on the development of energy technologies. because the social dimension is then conceived and approached as a social/institutional barrier to the realisation of a (pre) given technological potential: the possibility for social actors to take part in the construction of this technological potential is sidetracked from the beginning. More broadly. by conceiving such an abstract physical potential as a guide to energy change. it is a whole set of actual issues and of messy but decisive socio-material relations involved in the development of energy projects that are not properly accounted for. With them. it is the so-called ‘externalities’ and the sustainability–ie the social or environmental consequences–involved in changing our ways of dealing with energy (ies) that are not fully addressed. Ready-made dichotomies such as ‘renewable’/‘non-renewable’.‘non-fossil’/‘fossil’energy. serve this state of affairs.

Dordrecht,In 2000. at the dawn of the adoption of the EU Directive on renewable energy. a green-red alliance opened a political window for the emergence of a genuine wind power policy in France. Yet today. after more than 10 years of one of the highest feed-in tariffs in the world. the installed capacity in France is still low. Wind power. if it is to be developed at any significant level. has to fight against the centralization of both French energy policy and landscape protection. In this context. the landscape processes. which take place when wind power is either planned or sited at the local level through open governance. are places and occasions for institutional and social innovation that contribute to building decentralization.

1205991,0423 Geospatial trends in occupational injury and workers’ compensation utilisation,2017,Katherine Schofield and Laure Charleux,74,,Suppl 1,A133-A134,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd,Workers’ compensation data provide a source of information on occupational injuries and their burden on workers and the workplace. Injured workers utilise healthcare systems for treatment of their injuries and various factors may influence access to care and the ultimate outcome of the claim. Some factors may be dependent wholly. or in part. on geographical access to care and the communities in which employees live. We explored a new injury surveillance and analysis technique by coupling of geographical information systems (GIS) and workers’ compensation data. Employee addresses were geocoded using Esri Street Map to determine spatial trends. Time/distance (accessibility) to health care providers were calculated. Geographic masking maintained individual-level confidentiality.

1205992,Mobility & activity patterns of individuals and parenting couples in the metropolitan area of Grenoble (France),2016,Isabelle André-Poyaud and Sonia Chardonnel and Laure Charleux and Kamila Tabaka,,,,,,The geographies of our daily lives are becoming increasingly complex through phenomena such as urban sprawl. scattering of life spaces and the involvement of individuals in multiple types of activities. Daily mobility behavior can be seen as the keystone holding together the spatial components and time dimensions of the daily lives of individuals. each of whom must mobilize resources (technical and economic) and competencies (cultural and social) to organize as best they can their activities and travels across their life spaces. In this context. the conceptual framework of Time-Geography is particularly helpful. as it provides theoretical tools to investigate the space-time dimensions of daily life (Hägerstrand 1985; Lenntorp 1976; Carlestam & Sollbe 1991). Most of its principles have been adapted to mobility studies and are nowadays frequently used in the “activity-based” approach. which seeks to incorporate information on activity programs in the study of mobility behaviors (Axhausen & Gärling 1992). Our work clearly lies within this framework. Indeed. categories traditionally used to describe trip chains are inadequate for identifying the complex modes of daily organization that lie behind the diversity of mobility patterns (Kaufmann 2004). It would thus seem necessary to develop new ways to describe jointly individuals’ trip chains. activity planning and life spaces and to investigate links between all three. This is what we aim to do in this paper. through the production of new categories of mobility behaviors. based on standardized observations (household travel survey) in the French metropolitan area of Grenoble.,True,gYc6XUUAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01260244/,,,,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01260244/file/MOBILITY%20ACTIVITY%20PATTERNS_INDIVIDUALS_PARENTING%20COUPLES.pdf,0,0,0

Using the satellite images LANDSAT in 1975. 1992. 2000 and 2010. the land-use data for the four corresponding years was generated in the first place. and the diachronic land-use analysis from 1975 to 2010 was next carried out. In order to generate the four land-use maps. the satellite images were classified using the Maximum Likelihood supervised classification. The land-use map in 2010 is validated based on the observations from ground visits in 2011. Other land-use maps are validated by the ground truth data established from the auxiliary information layers taken in the area. Based on the trend in the past evolution of land-use. a prediction of future land-use is generated. using the Land Change Modeler (LCM). Next. the multi-temporal analysis of land-use change is carried out and the variables affecting the LCM are evaluated using Multi-Layer Perceptron and Markov transition probabilities. Two pairs of maps (1975. 1992) and (1992. 2000) are used to generate the predictive maps.

Ce texte part du constat que deux termes sont de manière récurrente associés au paysage. le patrimoine et. plus récemment. le bien commun. et se propose d’interroger cette orientation du discours sur le paysage. La pratique et le cadre juridique français. tendent à enfermer le paysage dans un registre avant tout patrimonial. privilégiant une logique de protection.

Ce phénomène s’observe sur divers territoires en France. mais il prend une acuité particulière dans les régions touristiques où cette activité exacerbe les pressions en rentrant en concurrence avec les autres logiques d’occupation de l’espace. en pesant sur le marché des biens mais aussi sur le dynamisme économique et l’attractivité. L'augmentation continue du montant des transactions influence donc fortement. à terme. le profil socio-économique des territoires. les formes d’occupation de l’espace et. dès lors. les choix politiques. Néanmoins les interactions entre l'économie touristique et ce qu’il est convenu d’appeler la pression foncière restent encore à comprendre.

1206037,Parcours nocturnes: étude sociologique sur l'ambiance et les usagers nocturnes Mail d'Empalot et cité Bordelongue (Toulouse),2004,Sandra Fiori and Karine Houdemont and Martine Leroux,,,,68,,Cette étude constitue le volet sociologique d'une commande de la ville de Toulouse portant sur la mise en lumière de deux espaces urbains. la cité Bordelongue et le mail du grand ensemble d'Empalot. qui tous deux appartiennent à des quartiers d'habitat social en Grand Projet de Ville. Son objectif est. à partir du recueil et de l'analyse des perceptions et usages nocturnes propres aux lieux. d'établir pour chaque site une série de propositions amenées à fonder ou enrichir le projet de mise en lumière. Elle fait pour cela appel à plusieurs méthodes d'enquête in-situ : observations. entretiens et parcours commentés réalisés avec des habitants et représentants ou partenaires de la maîtrise d'ouvrage à la fin de l'hiver et au printemps 2004. Le diagnostic sensible qui en résulte s'articule autour de trois points : la perception nocturne exprimée en termes de quantité d'éclairage. de besoins fonctionnels et de sentiment de sécurité ; l'identification de configurations spatiales et visuelles plus précises croisant points de vue. cheminements et effets liés à l'éclairage. et enfin la description des usages et représentations observés ou exprimés. Pour chaque site. la hiérarchisation des espaces et l'accompagnement nocturne des pratiques quotidiennes sont alors proposés comme trame d'intervention pour le projet. Cette trame s'attache notamment à définir une modulation des qualités d'ambiance en fonction du caractère plus ou moins public de chaque espace.

De ce point de vue. elle considère le sensible comme un opérateur de formes nouvelles d'urbanité et questionne à ce titre les différents modes d'intervention sur la ville. Il s' agit donc moins de partir d'une logique du lieu que d'une logique d'action sur la ville par le sensible. Le champ principal d'investigation est celui de l'espace public urbain. compris au sens large du terme. Trois catégories d'acteurs sont au centre de ce travail: les nouveaux professionnels en matière de conception urbaine. les artistes intervenant en milieu urbain et les usagers des espaces publics souterrains. Malgré la diversité des points de vue abordés. il apparaît quelques grandes orientations qui mériteraient d'être plus amplement étudiées:- l'ordinaire urbain reconsidéré: moyennant un changement de regard. ce qui passait auparavant pour banal et insignifiant se dote ici d'un interêt pour l'usage et le plaisir de l'usage;- le corps sensible et engagé: il est considéré sensible dans la mesure où il reçoit les stimulations sensorielles de l'environnement. et engagé. dans la mesure où il effectue une action dans l'espace urbain;- le devenir de la ville sensible: il s' agit donc de laisser la place à un potentiel d'improvisation tout en offrant un minimum de référents partagés aux passants. C'est au prix d'un équilibre subtil entre ces deux voies qu'émerge la ville sensible. Les résultats de cette recherche permettent d'envisager dès lors une voie qu'on peut qualifier de médiane. Cette alternative se définit par deux critères importants: le lieu et le savoir-faire.,True,KZ17QIcAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5603985986740793597&hl=en&oi=scholarr,5603985986740793597,/scholar?cites=5603985986740793597,,,0,0,0

L’ouvrage de Sérgio Ferro repose sur une trajectoire brésilienne peu connue en France et pourtant déterminante. initiée pendant la construction de Brasilia au sein d’un trio de jeunes architectes de Sao Paulo. et dont la contribution architecturale et théorique s’inscrit dans le Brésil des années 1960. Cette trajectoire se confond aussi plus largement avec celle d’une avant-garde intellectuelle et artistique de gauche tiraillée par les tensions entre modernité et sous-développement. perspectives de transformations sociales et résistance au régime militaire d’après 1964. L’article propose alors une « lecture brésilienne » du texte Dessin-chantier en retraçant le récit de cette trajectoire biographique d’avant l’exil et en évoquant l’héritage vivant dont les travaux théoriques de Ferro sur l’architecture font l’objet au Brésil ; ce faisant. il met en évidence la dimension fondamentalement politique de l’œuvre de Sérgio Ferro.,True,KZ17QIcAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,1,https://journals.openedition.org/craup/591,15987030205000857218,/scholar?cites=15987030205000857218,,https://journals.openedition.org/craup/591,0,0,0

In this framework. a context of use is decomposed into three facets: the end users of the interactive system. the hardware and software computing platform with which the users have to carry out their interactive tasks and the physical environment where they are working. Therefore. a context-sensitive user interface is a user interface that exhibits some capability to be aware of the context (context awareness) and to react to changes of this context. This paper attempts to provide a unified understanding of context-sensitive user interfaces rather than a prescription of various ways or methods of tackling different steps of development.

Providing a user interface specially crafted for each context of use is extremely costly and may result in inconsistent behavior.

A plastic user interface is capable of adapting to variations of the context of use while preserving usability.

London,Mobility coupled with the development of a wide variety of access devices has engendered new requirements for HCI such as the ability of user interfaces to adapt to different contexts of use. We define a context of use as the set of values of variables that characterise thecomputational device(s) used for interacting with the system as well as the physical and social environment where the interaction takes place. A user interface is plastic if it is able to adapt to context changes while preserving usability. In this paper. we present a process and a software mechanism that support context changes for plastic user interfaces.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Plastic User Interfaces (UI) are able to adapt to their context of use while preserving usability. Research efforts have focused so far. on the functional aspect of UI adaptation. while neglecting the usability dimension. This paper investigates how the notion of mapping as promoted by Model Driven Engineering (MDE). can be exploited to control UI adaptation according to explicit usability criteria. In our approach. a run-time UI is a graph of models related by mappings. Each model (e.g.. the task model. the Abstract UI. the Concrete UI. and the final UI) describes the UI from a specific perspective from high-level design decisions (conveyed by the task model) to low-level executable code (i.e. the final UI).

Plasticity is the capacity of a user interface to withstand variations of both the system physical characteristics and the environment while preserving usability.

Boston. MA,We propose the CARE properties as a simple way of characterising and assessing aspects of multimodal interaction: the Complementarity. Assignment. Redundancy. and Equivalence that may occur between the interaction techniques available in a multimodal user interface. We provide a formal definition of these properties and use the notion of compatibility to show how the system CARE properties interact with user CARE-like properties in the design of a system.

1206083,PAC. an object oriented model for dialog design,1987,Joëlle Coutaz,,,,431-436,North-Holland,PAC is an implementation model that attempts to bridge the gap between the abstract sphere of theoretical models and the practical affairs of building user interfaces. It takes as a basis the vertical decomposition of human-computer interaction into semantic. syntactic and pragmatic layers as promoted by some theoretical models. However. PAC stresses the fact that these notions do not form strict monolithic layers but are distributed across related “chunks”. called interactive objects. For doing so. PAC recursively structures an interactive application in three parts: the Presentation. the Abstraction and the Control. The Presentation defines the the concrete syntax of the application whereas the Abstraction corresponds to the semantics. The Control maintains the mapping and the consistency between the abstract entities and their presentation to the user. The Presentation of an application is in turn decomposed into a …,True,T_cuwFcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,370,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444703040500741,9243333120172968654,/scholar?cites=9243333120172968654,,,0,0,0

The flexibility they offer results in an increased complexity that current software tools do not address appropriately. One of the emerging technical problems in multimodal interaction is concerned with the fusion of information produced through distinct interaction techniques. In this article. we present a generic fusion engine that can be embedded in a multi-agent architecture modelling technique.

Heidelberg,In this paper we propose a software architecture for observing and modeling human activity. This architecture is derived from an ontology for context awareness. We propose a model in which a user’s context is described by a set of roles and relations. Different configurations of roles and relations correspond to situations within the context. The components of a context model are used to specify processes for observing activity. The ontology for context modeling is derived from both a bottom up system’s perspective and a top-down users’ perspective. As we define each element. we describe the corresponding components of a process-based software architecture. Using these components. a context is translated into a federation of observational processes. This model leads to an architecture in which reflexive elements are dynamically composed to form federations of processes for observing and predicting …,True,T_cuwFcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,266,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45809-3_9,15712040876846147333,/scholar?cites=15712040876846147333,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34668675/Crowley-2.pdf,0,0,0

Heidelberg,The increasing proliferation of computational devices has introduced the need for applications to run on multiple platforms in different physical environments. Providing a user interface specially crafted for each context of use is extremely costly and may result in inconsistent behavior. User interfaces must now be capable of adapting to multiple sources of variation. This paper presents a unifying framework that structures the development process of plastic user interfaces. A plastic user interface is capable of adapting to variations of the context of use while preserving usability.

It allows the observation of a user operating an apparently fully functioning system whose missing services are supplemented by a hidden wizard. From our analysis of existing WOz systems. we observe that this technique has primarily been used to study natural language interfaces. With recent advances in interactive media. multimodal user interfaces are becoming popular but our current understanding on how to design such systems is still primitive. In the absence of generalizable theories and models. the WOz technique is an appropriate approach to the identification of sound design solutions.

Our definition draws upon the distinction between the notion of an instant snapshot of observables (a situation) and the composition of these observables over time (a context). Observables and their relationships. which are elicited at the design stage of the development process. can be mapped. at the implementation phase. as colonies of contextors. A contextor is a software abstraction that models relationships between observables.

The Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach. which was used for user interface generation since the early eighties in HCI. has recently been revived to address this complex problem. Although MDE has resulted in interesting and convincing results for conventional WIMP user interfaces. it has not fully demonstrated its theoretical promises yet.

1206107,Des loups dans la cité: éléments d'écologie pragmatiste,2011,Antoine Doré,,,,,,Les politiques contemporaines sont marquées par des bouleversements écologiques qui interrogent la place à accorder à une liste toujours plus longue et hétérogène de prétendants à la vie publique. Cette thèse propose un examen empirique d’une telle dynamique à partir du cas de la mise en politique des loups en France. En traçant les multiples manières dont les loups interpellent ceux et ce qui les entourent. en décrivant les agencements hybrides d’humains et de non-humains qu’ils forment et transforment sur leur passage et en prêtant attention aux différentes manières dont les acteurs affectés prennent en charge les situations générées par ces animaux. il s’ agit d’identifier et de suivre. des portions importantes de quelques-unes des trajectoires qui composent la carrière politique des loups. Cette recherche montre comment des scientifiques. des juristes. des publics. des représentants de l’État. etc.. mais aussi les loups eux-mêmes. composent ces trajectoires spécifiques marquées par des pratiques. des temporalités. des spatialités. des matérialités particulières. L’analyse révèle comment la présence publique des loups est instaurée par la science. le droit. l’État. etc. Elle rend compte également réciproquement de la manière dont la science. le droit. l’État. etc.. s’ inventent et se transforment à travers les loups.

We advocate a thorough consideration of the organisational dimensions of the struggle to control this invasive biological aggressor. The objective of our work is to promote efficiency by questioning the management of risks relating to this pest. taking into account the social. organisational. and cultural rationalities in which collective action is located. Until now biological. ecological. and economic rationalities have ruled the cognitive framework for risk management and control. Analysis of the modes of structuring and analysis of the governance over systems of multi-level stakeholders who carry through and organise collective action for effective survey and control is thus essential to re-thinking and re-designing an efficient management system as well as integrating sustainable objectives. Better knowledge will promote understanding of the causes of malfunctions and inconsistencies in current management settings. A preventive management plan that fits a long term sustainable perspective will engage a pragmatic approach that integrates an analysis of the various logics at work as well as the routines and specific actions organised through control systems.

La faible fréquence des invasions. et la très grande amplitude du phénomène. invite à s’interroger sur la capacité des personnes affectées à réagir face à ces recrudescences spectaculaires qualifiées souvent de « catastrophes naturelles ». Cet article s’intéresse à la gestion des invasions de criquets pèlerins. et ce à partir d’un travail d’observation participante effectué au sein du Centre national de lutte antiacridienne de Mauritanie au cours de la dernière grande invasion de 2003-2005.

Les acteurs de la lutte anti-acridienne établissent et «appareillent» des stratégies de gestion dont les résultats sont souvent difficiles à apprécier du fait de l'existence de situations de crise suivies de longs moments de rémission où les investissements de veille et de lutte semblent superflus. Ce mémoire de Master tente de décrire et de comprendre les modes d'existence et de mise en dispositif de la gestion des risques liés aux invasions de Criquet pèlerin. Trois niveaux d'approche sont proposés:(1) une analyse processuelle de l'invasion 2003-2005 qui donne des éléments d'analyse sur la temporalité du dispositif de gestion et sur la manière dont celui-ci s' accommode et rentre en continuité avec une temporalité bio-écologique complexe et relativement imprévisible;(2) une analyse ethnographique du Centre de Lutte Anti-Acridienne de Mauritanie qui met en évidence la structure et le fonctionnement de la veille qui maintient la coexistence efficace d'un ordre bureaucratique et d'un ordre traditionnel;(3) une analyse des modalités de la gouvernance à l'oeuvre dans la gestion des risques liés au Criquet pèlerin qui offre une analyse des logiques d'acteurs. Le document propose ainsi un nouveau regard sur les perspectives de gestion intégrée des risques liés au Criquet pèlerin en quittant une approche positiviste et planificatrice centrée sur les invasions pour aller vers une approche constructiviste et gestionnaire de la mise en dispositifs de la gestion des …,True,q_zhWxIAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,1,https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=FR2019148145,11698630859072273726,/scholar?cites=11698630859072273726,,,0,0,0

1206152,De la ressource territoriale à la ressource patrimoniale,2016,Nicolas Senil and Pierre-Antoine Landel,,,,,Presses Universitaires de Rennes,A une époque où l’objectif de durabilité est partout recherché. la ressource patrimoniale apparaît comme une solution espérée pour s’opposer à l’obsolescence programmée.  L’accélération actuelle des mutations justifie un approfondissement de l’étude des dynamiques à l’œuvre. A côté des processus de polarisation et de métropolisation. l’usage du temps. trop longtemps oublié par les différents travaux engagés sur l’analyse des territoires. se doit d’être tout autant étudié. Parmi les résultats importants. il apparaît que le patrimoine ne s’oppose pas au changement. Se jouent au contraire dans ces processus des innovations qui sont amenés à se généraliser. En faisant de l’association. du partage et de la coopération son moteur. le patrimoine s’oppose au modèle de la compétition qui frappe toujours plus durement. Dans un contexte où les territoires se doivent de dépasser les seuls bénéfices des transferts liés à la résidentialité (Davezies. 2012) par une relance de leur productivité. la question de l’avenir apparaît encore plus incertaine. Si l’agriculture. l’énergie peuvent encore attirer de nouvelles populations et permettre aux présentes de s’y maintenir. la ruralité doit pouvoir aussi pouvoir tirer profit de ses coopérations héritées. de ses savoir-faire polyvalents. pour s’affirmer comme un espace de résilience.

A destination is an ensemble of territory-specific resources whose uniqueness is highlighted by their anchorage within the territory. The present article describes a framework for analyzing territorial resources through the three stages of resource construction. that is. revelation. development. and articulation with other resources. It then describes two case studies. in Morocco and Niger. conducted using this approach. Our framework can be used to investigate the notion of resource attribute in more detail and to examine the conditions under which a “panier de biens” combining tradable and non-tradable objects is formed.

1206163,Cities. regions and flows,2013,Peter V Hall and Markus Hesse,40,,,,Routledge,Urban regions have come under increasing pressure to adapt to the imperatives of mobility. including greater freedom of travel. rising trade volumes and global economic networks. Whereas urbanization was once characterized by the concentration of services and facilities. urban areas now have to ensure the exchange of goods. services and information in a much more complex. interrelated. highly competitive. and spatially dispersed environment. As a consequence. cities are challenged to ensure the functionality of infrastructure while mitigating negative environmental and social impacts. Cities. Regions and Flows brings together debates in a single volume to present a theoretical framework for understanding the changing relationship between places and movement. It analyses the significance of flows of goods for urban and regional development and emphasises the twin processes of integration and disintegration that result from goods movement within urban space. It discusses urban regions as nodes for organizing the exchange of goods. services and information against a background of socio-economic and technological change. as well as new patterns of urbanization. The new logistics concepts and practices that have been developed in response to these changes exert both integrative and disintegrative effects on cities and regions.

Trucks emit many pollutants (notably NOx and particulate matter) because they mostly use diesel and because there is a high proportion of old trucks and vans circulating in cities. As a result of this research. it seems that there are few policy innovations in freight issues in cities. Even more surprising is. in France. the low level of legal disputes over air quality standards attainment issues. Nonetheless. responding to public opinion's increasing concern over health issues and to European standards for urban air quality. some European cities have started to reserve access to city centres to new. ‘clean’ or ‘fully loaded’ trucks. By doing so. they have …,True,JCBX7RQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,99,https://academic.oup.com/jel/article-abstract/20/2/245/450374,5430580374863235448,/scholar?cites=5430580374863235448,,,0,0,0

Metropolitan areas around the world are seeking ways to manage urban freight and its impacts. This paper presents the results from a comprehensive international survey of urban freight management strategies. The objective was to examine the effectiveness of alternative strategies and assess their transferability for U.S. implementation. Three categories were used to describe urban freight strategies: last-mile or first-mile deliveries and pickups. environmental mitigation. and trade node strategies. Many possibilities were found for the improved management of urban freight and its impacts; these possibilities included labeling and certification programs. incentive-based programs for voluntary emissions reduction. local land use and parking …,True,JCBX7RQAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,98,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3141/2379-04,10661770868279865910,/scholar?cites=10661770868279865910,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00854997/document,0,0,0

Part I deals with the manifestations of tourism gentrification and the ways it affects urban landscapes through heritagization and urban regeneration strategies. Part II looks at the correlations between tourism gentrification and culture. Finally. the last two parts aim to identify and examine forms and expressions of tourism gentrification. distinguishing among the actors. beneficiaries. and victims of the phenomenon while looking at its implications for intra-metropolitan territories and metropolitan governance.

1206190,The cultural heritage of pastoralism-local knowledge. state identity and the global perspective: the example of local breeds in Morocco.,2016,Ben Hounet and AM Brisebarre and Sandra Guinand,35,,2,357-370,,Over the past few decades. the heritage designation process has come to impact on the way of life of many nomadic pastoralists across the world. Since the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage was adopted in 1972. policies for the conservation of protected areas have been implemented under the aegis of the United Nations Educational. Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). especially in countries of the South. with a varying impact on the practices and perceptions of pastoral communities. Heritage policies were further extended by the establishment of the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage (the Convention was adopted by the UNESCO General Conference in October 2003 and came into force in 2006) and the list of Cultural Landscapes (adoption in 1992. with the first site listed in 1993). This enthusiasm for heritage. which is felt by States and local communities alike. provides an opportunity to study the contradictions and changing perceptions of the nomadic and pastoral identity. In this context of wholesale heritage designation. it is interesting to examine how local knowledge-especially that on hardy animal breeds-is promoted and safeguarded. The authors focus on the case of Morocco. where the national association of sheep and goat breeders (ANOC) oversees breed selection and health policy for local breeds. in order to demonstrate that greater recognition of farmers' knowledge and their ability to identify hardy animals can ensure the sustainability of farms in both South and North from a socio-economic. genetic and health standpoint.,True,POhY9jEAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,5,https://europepmc.org/article/med/27917986,6573610891403128352,/scholar?cites=6573610891403128352,,,0,0,0

After two decades of strategic plans. it could be assumed that the crisis worked as an engine for change (Allasino. Bobbio. Neri. 2000): ambitious strategic urban policies. and a widespread valorisation of cultural heritage were set in motion. leading the city to the 20th Olympic Winter Games. hosted in 2006. when. for the first time. Turin was promoted as a brand new capital of cultural tourism. Nevertheless. in this phase. the launch of the touristic image was referred almost to the historic Centre of the city while the peripheral suburbs were still struggling in a slowest process of architectural and social regeneration (Salone. Baraldi. Pazzola. 2017). Actually. the topic of tourism supplies the evidence of the time gap. existing between the adoption of urban policies on a metropolitan scale. and their effective reception in each singular neighbourhood. For instance. in Barriera di Milano. following the outcomes of the European urban regeneration program. public institutions and individual stakeholders started in 2014 capitalising them. in terms of touristic opportunities. Meanwhile. the municipality. in agreement with local authorities. was already setting up Torino 2025—a new Strategic Plan. which overcomes the topic of the touristic development. and focuses on the keywords Education.

1206207,Perceptual components for context aware computing,2002,James L Crowley and Joëlle Coutaz and Gaeten Rey and Patrick Reignier,,,,117-134,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,In this paper we propose a software architecture for observing and modeling human activity. This architecture is derived from an ontology for context awareness. We propose a model in which a user’s context is described by a set of roles and relations. Different configurations of roles and relations correspond to situations within the context. The components of a context model are used to specify processes for observing activity. The ontology for context modeling is derived from both a bottom up system’s perspective and a top-down users’ perspective.

We will define reactive navigation as a mapping between sensory data and commands. Building a reactive navigation system means providing such a mapping. It can come from a family of predefined functions (like potential fields methods) or it can be built using ‘universal’ approximators (like neural networks). In this paper. we will consider another ‘universal’ approximator: fuzzy logic. We will explain how to choose the rules using a behaviour decomposition approach. It is possible to build a controller working quite well but the classical problems are still there: oscillations and local minima. Finally. we will conclude that learning is necessary for a robust navigation system and fuzzy logic is an easy way to put some initial knowledge in the system to avoid learning from zero.,True,ORXh9RIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,146,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0921889094900213,7631755129182556060,/scholar?cites=7631755129182556060,,,0,0,0

To understand human activity. we need to identify human actors and their interpersonal links. An interaction group can be seen as basic entity. within which individuals collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. In this regard. the dynamic change of interaction group configuration. ie the split and merge of interaction groups. can be seen as indicator of new activities. Our approach takes speech activity detection of individuals forming interaction groups as input.

Heidelberg,In order to provide information and communication services without disrupting human activity. information services must implicitly conform to the current context of human activity. However. the variability of human environments and human preferences make it impossible to preprogram the appropriate behaviors for a context aware service. One approach to overcoming this obstacle is to have services adapt behavior to individual preferences though feedback from users. This article describes a method for learning situation models to drive context-aware services. With this approach an initial simplified situation model is adapted to accommodate user preferences by a supervised learning algorithm using feedback from users. To bootstrap this process. the initial situation model is acquired by applying an automatic segmentation process to sample observation of human activities.

1206232,Learning context models for the recognition of scenarios,2006,Sofia Zaidenberg and Oliver Brdiczka and Patrick Reignier and James Crowley,,,,86-97,Springer. Boston. MA,This paper addresses the problem of automatic learning of scenarios. A ubiquitous computing environment must have the ability to perceive its occupants and their activities in order to recognize a context and to provide appropriate services. A context (a scenario) can be modeled as a temporal sequence of situations. Hard coding contexts by hand is a complex task. Our goal is to learn these context models based on a set of videos showing actors playing predefined scenarios. Once these models are learned. we can use them to classify new scenarios. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are particularly well suited for problems with a strong temporal structure; they are easily adaptable to variability of input and robust to noise. But two problems need to be addressed: how many HMMs do we need for all possible scenarios and how many states for each HMM. We propose in this paper an approach based on an …,True,ORXh9RIAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,15,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-34224-9_11,5448475965399378385,/scholar?cites=5448475965399378385,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/0-387-34224-9_11.pdf,0,0,0

Considering the fact that biomass sources are relatively abundant and offer more feedstock versatility. these resources have become an attractive alternative to petroleumbased products. Despite the potentials as fuel and source of different chemicals. very few studies on biomass and municipal solid waste (MSW) characterization have been reported for Bangladesh. To assess the proper potential Proximate and Ultimate analysis of Municipal solid waste and almost fifty other major conventional and unconventional biomass resources have been performed and their heating values are calculated as well. These biomass samples had relatively lower heating value (15-19 MJ/kg) and low ash content (1-8%) with negligible Sulphur content. MSW samples had moderate moisture (60%) and relatively high ash content (27%) on dry basis. Heating value of MSW was lower (8.6-13.4 MJ/kg) than other different biomass resources analyzed. Experimental values of heating values of different biomass were assessed by comparing with results acquired from different empirical correlations of heating value.

The DTF is a 2.0 m long quartz reactor consisting of two concentric tubes (diameters 50 mm and 80 mm). Morwell coal char with diameter of< 106μm (mean value= 50μm) is used for this investigation. This char sample was prepared in a tubular furnace under pure N 2 at 823K. The char is gasified under CO 2/N 2 atmosphere at temperatures of 1173 and 1273K. The gas compositions from char gasification in the DTF are measured on-line using micro gas chromatography (GC). The results show that char conversion and CO concentration increases with increasing the inlet gas temperature. At 1273K. CO concentration increases due to increased rate of the char-CO 2 reaction. A 3D comprehensive numerical modeling is employed to investigate the char-CO 2 gasification process under various operating conditions. The calculated results are compared with experiments at two different temperatures of 1173 and 1273K using at 20 vol.% CO 2/N 2 mixtures. The comparisons show a good agreement confirming the validity of the current model. We predict carbon conversion from char-CO 2 gasification for various char particle sizes at elevated gas temperature (> 1273K). The temperature distribution in the furnace is found to be uniform under current operating conditions. It is also found that the char conversion significantly depend on the inlet gas temperature and particle size.,True,TCbVpZMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,https://okayama.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/investigation-of-brown-coal-char-cosub2sub-gasification-in-a-labo,2358694880242811892,/scholar?cites=2358694880242811892,,,0,0,0

To manage this waste in a sustainable way. it is necessary to develop integrated processes to find its multiple utilization pathways. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of MSW integrated with power generation and nutrient recovery could be a plausible solution to the wet waste handling problem in a densely populated country like Bangladesh. In this study. MSW sampled from a landfill of Dhaka city revealed the presence of high amount of organic waste (~ 74 w/w%). This facilitated the concept of waste valorization through nutrient recovery. The heating value of the MSW was found to be 14.7 MJ/kg (on dry basis) making it a suitable source for power generation. HTC experiments on the waste showed a retention of almost ~83% of the energy in biocoal. Based on these results. an integrated biorefinery having a capacity of processing all the MSW generated in Dhaka. can produce 45 MWe power with 3.2 ton/day of K and 0.9 ton/day of Ca as by-product.

The reactor temperature variation with respect to the O 2 to fuel ratio and the syngas composition with temperature were evaluated for gasification performance. The results showed the H 2/CO ratio for lipid-extracted algae (LEA) was very similar to the gasification behavior of raw algae (RA) before lipid extraction. Only a slight variation was observed for the lower heating value (9.2 MJ/Nm3 for RA and 8.9 MJ/Nm 3 for LEA at 1000 o C) of the syngas from the two feedstocks. The H 2/CO ratio for both RA and LEA remained almost the same over the range of temperatures (800-1400 oC) under consideration. The cold gas efficiency was found between 82% to 75% for RA and 75% to 69% for LEA at 1000 o C and 1400 o C respectively.

The application of boundary conditions that are inconsistent with the profiles used at the inflow boundary causes streamwise gradients in the solution and prevents the simulation of a horizontally homogeneous boundary layer. In the present work these problems are overcome by applying a simple extension of the shear stress boundary condition at the top of the domain and by using one-dimensional models to generate inflow profiles in equilibrium with the ground boundary condition. This procedure allows the impact of the inconsistent boundary conditions to be quantitatively assessed. It is shown that inconsistent boundary conditions at the top of the domain result in erroneous streamwise gradients throughout the domain. These errors are reduced by enlarging the domain in …,True,_UuzYboAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,77,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610510001182,11689219832165558595,/scholar?cites=11689219832165558595,,,0,0,0

This coefficient includes the use of a Weibull distribution to handle variability in the wind velocity. and also accounts for the geometric relationship between the turbines and the boundaries of the wind sector. This interference coefficient then forms part of a mixed integer linear program (MILP) which is used to optimise the locations of wind turbines within a wind farm site. The MILP approach is an exact method that can guarantee that the turbine locations determined by the model are optimal with respect to an a priori chosen set of possible turbine locations.

This paper addresses this issue theoretically. via reservoir simulation. and via production data analysis type curves. This paper presents the single phase fluid flow equation for a slightly compressible fluid in a stress sensitive reservoir in a form which can be solved in Laplace space to generate profiles of well flow rate versus time (for constant bottomhole pressure production). This is achieved by writing the flow equation in terms of the derivatives of a function involving the sum of pressure and pressure-squared terms.

Their contractile performance has been observed to vary inversely with thickness. This inverse dependence has been attributed. almost without exception. to inadequate diffusion of oxygen into the centers of muscles of large diameter. It is thus commonly hypothesized that the radius-dependent diminution of performance reflects the development of an anoxic core. We tested this hypothesis theoretically by solving a modification of the diffusion equation. in which the rate of oxygen consumption is a sigmoidal function of the partial pressure of oxygen.

1206332,Computing flow and pressure transients in heterogeneous media using boundary element methods,2000,Rosalind Ann Archer,,,,,,This work studied the modeling of well tests. tracer tests and multiphase flow in heterogeneous media using boundary element based methods. The motivation for this work was to provide accurate forward models of these processes to be used with parameter estimation/data integration schemes. Boundary element methods are attractive because of their rigorous Green’s function basis. The classical boundary element method is however limited to single-phase flow in homogeneous media. This work explored how to recast the differential equations of practical interest to petroleum reservoir engineers in a form suitable for solution with a boundary element scheme. For flows in heterogeneous media the integral forms of the flow equations contain domain integrals which can not be treated with the classical boundary element method. To handle these terms two hybrid boundary element methods were considered. the Dual Reciprocity Boundary Element Method (DRBEM) and the Green Element Method (GEM). The theory of both methods was considered. however most of the applications presented used GEM because of its sparse matrix structure and amenability to nonlinear problems.A numerical method that combines GEM with singularity programming was proposed for the modeling of well tests in heterogeneous reservoirs. The method showed excellent accuracy when reproducing the pressure and pressure derivative curves.

Frictional pressure drop within the wellbore is frequently a controlling factor on the performance of long horizontal wells. Frictional pressure drop could be especially significant in wells completed with screens and slotted liners. This pressure loss is neglected in traditional inflow-performance (IPR) calculations. such as those developed by SD Joshi and by DK Babu and AS Odeh.

We present a numerical model that approximates this circulation in a statistical sense. being constrained by TVZ dimensions and mean thermal properties. but incorporating a permeability distribution of arbitrary heterogeneity. A particle tracking methodology that accounts for advective and dispersive transport is introduced. and ensembles of several tens of thousands of flow paths are constructed for each of the modeled geothermal systems. These flow paths reveal the nature of mass recharge in multicell convective systems. and suggest the ages of waters in TVZ geothermal systems vary between 5 and 50 kyr.

Much of the research has been based on either health or urban design paradigms. rather than from collaborative approaches. Previous health reviews in the urban design area have been constrained to perceptions of the neighborhood or walking behaviors. consequently limiting the understanding of built environment influences on physical activity modalities.

Recently there has been an emerging body of literature and guidance illustrating the role the built environment has in shaping health outcomes; much of this has focussed on physical activity behaviours. Associations between built environment attributes and physical activity have been reported by many studies. however the geographic scales at which these built environment attributes need to be measured and the magnitude of the built environment attributes required to support physical activity are not clear.

However. much of the existing research in this emergent public health field is hindered by methodological limitations. including: population and site homogeneity. reliance on self-report measures. aggregated measures of PA. and inadequate statistical modeling. As an integral component of multi-country collaborative research. the Understanding the Relationship between Activity and Neighbourhoods (URBAN) Study seeks to overcome these limitations by determining the strengths of association between detailed measures of the neighborhood built environment with PA levels across multiple domains and body size measures in adults and children. This article outlines the research protocol developed for the URBAN Study. The URBAN Study is a multi-centered. stratified. cross-sectional research design. collecting data across four New Zealand cities. Within each city. 12 neighborhoods were identified and selected for investigation based on higher or lower walkability and Māori demographic attributes. Neighborhoods were selected to ensure equal representation of these characteristics. Within each selected neighborhood. 42 households are being randomly selected and an adult and child (where possible) recruited into the study. Data collection includes: objective and self-reported PA engagement. neighborhood perceptions. demographics. and body size measures.

Existing studies have failed to reach a consensus on whether or not regional house prices exhibit long-run convergence with each other. The application is proposed of a new test involving unit root testing of the first principal component based on regional—national house price differentials. Using mix-adjusted quarterly data for 1973—2006. it is found that the first principal component is stationary. This suggests that all UK regional house prices are driven by a single common stochastic trend. Further analysis suggests that those regions that are more distant from London exhibit the highest degrees of persistence with respect to deviations in house price differentials.,True,yWgtWT0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,164,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0042098008091489,1529009812347282579,/scholar?cites=1529009812347282579,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.834.4236&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1206376,Innovation and Independence: The Reserve Bank of New Zealand. 1973-2002,2013,John Singleton,,,,,Auckland University Press,In the 33 years since the last history of the New Zealand Reserve Bank the world has changed. New Zealanders now closely follow the Reserve Bank Governor's statements and the Bank's presence in the national life is strong. The Bank is internationally renowned for its strong mandate to eliminate inflation. having been the first reserve or central bank in the world to adopt the'inflation targeting'approach to monetary policy. The Bank also maintains the integrity of the currency; preserves the stability of the financial system and undertakes a range of activities on behalf of the people of New Zealand. Innovation and Independence tells the fascinating story of how this small central bank took the opportunities created by the political changes of the 1980s to design a unique institutional policy framework. rather than merely adapt an off-the-shelf overseas package. The Reserve Bank's operational independence. once revolutionary. is now widely accepted internationally. Eight chapters cover the Bank's early history and the deepening crises of the 1970s and early 1980s-oil shocks. the reverse in trade terms and the'Muldoon years'; the intellectual developments in the Bank leading up to the crucial change of government in 1984; the aftermath of the post-1984 policy revolution and the ground-breaking Reserve Bank Act 1989; inflation targeting; the removal of controls and the development of new forms of registration; and the Bank's internal cost cutting policies and withdrawal from non-core activities.

1206377,Water. water somewhere: The value of water in a drought-prone farming region,2008,Arthur Grimes and Andrew Aitken,,,1124-2019-3149,,,Water is critical for agriculture. yet surprisingly few studies internationally have analysed the value placed on water in specific farming contexts. We do so using a rich longitudinal dataset for the Mackenzie District (Canterbury. New Zealand) over nineteen years. enabling us to extract the value placed by farmers on long-term access to irrigated water. New Zealand has a system of water consents under the Resource Management Act (RMA) that enables farmers with consents to extract specified quantities of water for agricultural purposes. Some water is extracted through large-scale irrigation infrastructure and other flows by more localised means; the RMA and the water consents themselves are a critical legal infrastructure underpinning farming.Using panel methods. we estimate property sale price and assessed value as a function of the size of the farm’s water right (if it has one). farm characteristics. and the water right interacted with farm characteristics to determine how the value of a water consent varies according to local conditions. We find that flatter areas and areas with poorly draining soils benefit most from irrigation. possibly because the water is retained for longer on these properties. Drier areas appear to benefit more from irrigation than do areas with higher rainfall. Farms that are situated close to towns derive especially strong benefits from irrigation since these properties are most likely to have potential waterintensive land uses such as dairying and cropping that require access to processing facilities and/or an urban labour pool.,True,yWgtWT0AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,41,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/292649/,13588118387394178937,/scholar?cites=13588118387394178937,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/292649/files/08_10.pdf,0,0,0

However. many studies find it difficult to control adequately for selection effects in the form of factors. some of which may be unobserved. that encourage both homeownership and investment in social capital by households. A biennial survey conducted in New Zealand cities provides data that enable the control of such selection effects with propensity score matching methods. while also benchmarking the results by means of regression methods. The results confirm that homeownership exerts positive impacts on the formation of social capital.

However. despite promises of substantial gains from its deployment. the evidence from recent empirical studies suggests that the productivity gains may not be as large as originally hypothesised. If substantiated. these findings suggest that current government plans to apply significant sums to bring forward the deployment of fast fibre networks (eg in both Australia and New Zealand) may not generate returns to the extent anticipated by their sponsors. Drawing upon the original'computer productivity paradox'literature. this paper develops a critical questioning framework to assist policy-makers in identifying the salient productivity issues to be addressed when making the decision to apply scarce public resources to faster broadband network deployment. Using multiple literatures. the framework highlights the nuanced and highly complex ways in which broadband network speed may affect productivity. both positively and negatively.

Using a difference-in-difference regression approach coupled with a repeat-sales methodology. we test the hypotheses that house prices appreciated following the announcement and that the degree of appreciation reflected proximity to rail stations.

1206384,The role of the exchange rate in New Zealand monetary policy,1994,Arthur Grimes and Jason Wong,,Exchange rate policy and interdependence: Perspectives from the Pacific Basin,,181-95,Cambridge University Press,The objective of New Zealand monetary policy is clear: the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is to achieve and maintain price stability. deﬁned as annual consumer price inﬂation of between 0 and 2 percent. This is perhaps the most clearly stated and single-focused objective for monetary policy of any country. but the Reserve Bank nonetheless faces the same control problem as other monetary authorities. How should it implement monetary policy to achieve its objective? Is there some intermediate target that will assist in achieving price stability—for instance. a monetary aggregate or the exchange rate? The choice and use of such an intermediate target form the subject matter of this essay. The discussion is organized as follows. First. some background is provided concerning recent developments in New Zealand monetary policy and the existing monetary framework. Monetary policy is driven directly by the inﬂation target and is implemented primarily through control of the level of bank reserves via open market operations. In order to guide the setting of the target for bank reserves. inﬂationary inﬂuences (including the impact of monetary aggregate developments) are forecast and bank reserves are then set at a level that will yield an exchange rate band consistent with achieving the inﬂation target given the other inﬂationary inﬂuences.

Analysis of cyclical similarity is frequently carried out at the overall industry level. then interpreted with reference to regional industrial structures.

We test whether the NZDAUD exchange rate has insulated NZ from Australian shocks. but find it has not played a major buffering role in response to Australian industry shocks (including mining shocks).

While official guidance from the New Zealand Transport Agency recommends evaluating all impacts of vehicle operations. including noise and emissions. many are left unmeasured due to methodological difficulties. An additional challenge with bus and noise emissions is that network wide averages do not capture the site specific impacts. As a result. transport evaluations can arrive at conclusions that seem unrealistic from an on-the-ground perspective or rely instead on qualitative rather than quantitative judgements.This paper describes an approach to measuring transport externalities that is typically left unmeasured in fleet procurement decisions–vehicle noise and emissions. It then applies this approach to an urban bus fleet. showing how GIS data and simple quantitative modelling techniques can be used to understand the impact of bus operations on urban amenity.

Ltd.,Current research into desulfurization sorbents for coal gasification is aimed at maximizing sorption capacity. kinetics and attrition resistance. while minimizing cost and volatility. Isolating the chemical aspects of desulfurization sorbent performance. however. is difficult because sorption performance is highly dependent on the physical form of the sorbent. To guide sorbent development. thermodynamic calculations offer a consistent basis from which to compare various aspects of sorbent performance. which includes conversion. but also speciation. volatility and regeneration. This approach has been used to compare 24 potential sorbents for the removal of sulfur from syngas. including oxides of transition metals. alkaline earths. alkalis and borates.

The effect on the rate constant of increasing the length of the alkyl substituent on the cation was examined in a number of ionic liquid/acetonitrile mixtures. In general it was found that there was no significant effect of changing the alkyl substituent on the rate constant of this process. suggesting that any nanodomains in these mixtures do not have a significant effect on the outcome of this process.

We found that for a newly prepared cell. there was effective activation on electrodes by current treatment. and the improved performance of the cell was actually a consequence of cathode activation.

This is due to the fact that. at SOFC operating temperatures. volatile Cr species are generated over the chromia scale. poisoning the cathodes such as (La.Sr)MnO3 (LSM) and (La.Sr)(Co.Fe)O3 (LSCF) and causing a rapid degradation of the cell performance. Thus. a fundamental understanding of the interaction between the Fe–Cr alloys and SOFC cathode is essential for the development of high performance and stable SOFCs.

LSM electrodes without acid etching showed very high polarization potential for the O2 reduction and the electrode performance improved significantly with the cathodic current passage. On the other hand. for the reaction on LSM electrode after acid etching. the change in the polarization potential with the current passage time was much smaller and cathodic current passage had little enhancing or activation effect on the electrode performance. The results indicate that the dilute acid etching effectively replaced the activation process of the cathodic polarization on LSM electrodes and the initially very high polarization losses for the reaction on LSM electrodes are most likely originated from the passivation species such as MnOx and in particular SrO …,True,xPu2lO0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,267,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167273800008067,14558543477850402999,/scholar?cites=14558543477850402999,,,0,0,0

The impedance behaviour is characterised by two clearly separated arcs in the frequency domain. indicating that the overall electrode reaction is controlled by at least two rate limiting processes in series. The electrode process associated with the low frequency arc is mainly dependent on the H2 concentration. Moreover. the electrode conductivity of the low frequency arc (σL) is independent of temperature and the polarisation potential. Based on these observations. the electrode process associated with the low frequency arc has been attributed to hydrogen dissociative adsorption/diffusion on the surface of Ni particles.

Chem,12,2781-2800,,The last fundamental review on this general topic was entitled Dynamic Electrochemistry and diverted significantly from the earlier series on chemical sensors by Janata in scope and content. The last chemical sensors review. which appeared in 1998. had made it already clear that modern electronic searching and abstracting tools were becoming so powerful and widespread that it no longer made sense to write comprehensive reviews on a large topic. Indeed. the electrochemical sensors section of that review alone covered already some 1000 references. which made it nearly impossible for the authors to write a truly critical review. It was therefore decided that future fundamental reviews in this series should be drastically more selective.

However. only correctly determined selectivity coefficients allow accurate predictions of ISE responses to real-world samples. Moreover. they are also required for the optimization of ionophore structures and membrane compositions. Best suited for such purposes are potentiometric selectivity coefficients as defined already in the 1960s. This paper briefly reviews the basic relationships and focuses on possible biases in the determination of selectivity coefficients. The traditional methods to determine selectivity coefficients (separate solution method. fixed interference method) are still the same as those originally proposed by IUPAC in 1976.

1206505,Determination of unbiased selectivity coefficients of neutral carrier-based cation-selective electrodes,1997,Eric Bakker,69,Analytical Chemistry,6,1061-1069,American Chemical Society,A new procedure for the determination of selectivity coefficients of neutral carrier-based cation-selective electrodes is established that avoids exposure to the preferred ion prior to the measurement of discriminated ions. The method is. therefore. unbiased by the presence of preferred ions in the membrane that otherwise could mask the response to discriminated ion solutions. It is generally applicable as long as a series of considerations are met and can only be applied once for a given membrane. Careful studies with a series of sodium-. silver-. and calcium-selective electrodes reveal that Nernstian response slopes can now be obtained for even highly discriminated cations.

It is shown that the lower detection limit is improved by generating. in the membrane. ionic gradients that lead to a flux of primary ions toward the inner reference electrolyte solution. If the ion flux is too strong. it may cause analyte depletion at the membrane surface and. as a consequence. apparent super-Nernstian response. Such electrodes are not adequate to measure low analyte activities but can be used to determine unbiased selectivity factors.

In contrast. membranes containing Co(III) porphyrins require the addition of lipophilic cationic sites (e.g. tridodecylmethylammonium ions) in order to achieve optimal anion selectivity (for nitrite and thiocyanate) as well as rapid and reversible Nernstian response toward these anionic species.

Ion-exchange and coextraction equilibria on both sides of the membrane induce concentration gradients within the organic phase and. through the resulting ion fluxes. influence the lower detection limit. The latter is shown to improve considerably when very small gradients of decreasing primary ion concentration toward the inner electrolyte solution are created. By merely altering the concentration of the inner electrolyte. detection limits may vary by more than 5 orders of magnitude.

For ISEs that show Nernstian response toward all measured ions. the mixed ion response can often be described rigorously by a newly developed model that establishes required Nikolskii coefficients for a given target application. For ions of different charge. these obtained values are significantly different than predicted using the traditional Nikolskii–Eisenman equation. In contrast. for ISEs that show non‐Nernstian responses toward highly discriminated ions. two different procedures are recommended. depending on the scope of the experiment.

Different mechanisms for the continuous release of measuring ions from the membrane are conceivable. The extraction of inner electrolyte into the backside of the ion-selective membrane is predicted to lead to a concentration gradient of electrolyte across the membrane and therefore to a net flux of measuring ions from the inner filling solution to the sample. This effect is described by an extended model that respects the relevant extraction and diffusion processes. The extent of coextraction at the backside is predicted on the basis of …,True,TbMaOpYAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,216,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac970690y,8886209598059970414,/scholar?cites=8886209598059970414,,,0,0,0

It requires membrane potential measurements on two-layer sandwich membranes. where only one side contains the ionophore. The resulting initial membrane potential reflects the ion activity ratio at both aqueous phase−membrane interfaces and can be conveniently used to calculate complex formation constants in situ. This method is potentially useful. since it does not require the use of a reference ion or second ionophore in the measurement. In this paper. the five ionophores valinomycin. BME-44.

Based on transport and extraction studies. the heparin response is attributed to a nonequilibrium change in the phase boundary potential at the sample/membrane interface. While true equilibrium polyion response. obtained for low heparin concentrations only after very long equilibration times (> 20 h). yields the expected Nemstian response slope of< 1mV/decade. theobserved large and reproducible EMF response to clinically relevant heparin concentrations (~ 10~ 7 M) during typical measurement periods (2-5 min) is ascribed to a steady-state kinetic process defined by the flux of the polyion both to the surface and into the bulk of the polymer membrane.

The working principle and the cross-sensitivity of the gas gyroscope are also analyzed. Experiments were performed to confirm the simulation results and good agreement has been achieved. The measured sensitivities for the X-axis and Y-axis were 0.107 mV deg− 1 s− 1 and 0.102 mV deg− 1 s− 1. respectively. Compared with a gyroscope of the same configuration but using tungsten as a sensing element. this gyroscope has 42 times greater sensitivity and one quarter the power consumption.

There are thermal and non-thermal approaches for high-temperature flow measurement. Compared to their non-thermal counterparts. thermal flow sensors have recently attracted a great deal of interest due to the ease of fabrication. lack of moving parts and higher sensitivity. In recent years. various thermal flow sensors have been developed to operate at temperatures above 500 C. Microelectronic technologies such as silicon-on-insulator (SOI). and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) have been used to make thermal flow sensors. Thermal sensors with various heating and sensing materials such as metals. semiconductors. polymers and ceramics can be selected according to the targeted working temperature. The performance of these thermal flow sensors is evaluated based on parameters such as thermal response time. flow sensitivity. The data from thermal flow sensors reviewed in this paper indicate that the sensing principle is suitable for the operation under harsh environments.

Nevertheless. their use has been restricted due to the intrinsic interference between primer pairs. Performing several single PCRs in an array format instead of a multiplex PCR is a simple way to overcome this obstacle. However. there are still major technical challenges in designing a new generation of single PCR microreactors with a small sample volume. rapid thermal cycling. and no evaporation during amplification. We report a simple and robust core-shell bead array for a series of single amplifications. Four core-shell beads with a polymer coating and PCR mixture were synthesized using liquid marble formation and subsequent photo polymerization. Each bead can detect one target gene. We constructed a customised system for thermal cycling of these core-shell beads. Phylogrouping of the E. coli strains was carried out based on the fluorescent signal of the core-shell beads. This platform can be a promising alternative for multiplex nucleic acid analyses due to its simplicity and high throughput.

In contrast to conventional microfluidic technologies. where fluid inertia is negligible and flow remains almost within the Stokes flow region with very low Reynolds number (Re ≪ 1). inertial microfluidics works in the intermediate Reynolds number range (~1 < Re < ~100) between Stokes and turbulent regimes. In this intermediate range. both inertia and fluid viscosity are finite and bring about several intriguing effects that form the basis of inertial microfluidics including (i) inertial migration and (ii) secondary flow. Due to the superior features of high-throughput. simplicity. precise manipulation and low cost. inertial microfluidics is a very promising candidate for cellular sample processing. especially for samples with low …,True,nQww6TMAAAAJ:IsPWOBWtZBwC,505,https://pubs.rsc.org/az/content/articlehtml/2016/lc/c5lc01159k,4343880676347476699,/scholar?cites=4343880676347476699,,http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5877&context=eispapers,0,0,0

However. the inherent hydrophobic nature of the material limits the use of PDMS in many applications. While different methods have been developed to transform the hydrophobic PDMS surface to a hydrophilic surface. the actual implementation proved to be time consuming due to differences in equipment and the need for characterization. This paper reports a simple and easy protocol combining a second extended oxygen plasma treatments and proper storage to produce usable hydrophilic PDMS devices. The results show that at a plasma power of 70 W. an extended treatment of over 5 min would allow the PDMS surface to remain hydrophilic for more than 6 h.

Membraneless LFFCs benefit from the lamination of multiple streams in a microchannel. The lack of convective mixing leads to a well-defined liquid–liquid interface. Usually. anode and cathode are positioned at both sides of the interface. The liquid–liquid interface is considered as a virtual membrane and ions can travel across the channel to reach the other side and complete the ionic conduction. The advantage of membraneless LFFC is the lack of a physical membrane and the related issues of membrane conditioning can be eliminated or becomes less important.

In this study. temperature dependence of surface tension. interfacial tension and viscosity of a nanofluid are investigated for its applicability in droplet-based microfluidics. Experimental results show that nanofluids having TiO 2 nanoparticles of 15 nm diameter in deionized water exhibit substantially smaller surface tension and oil-based interfacial tension than those of the base fluid (ie deionized water). These surface and interfacial tensions of this nanofluid were found to decrease almost linearly with increasing temperature.

Nevertheless. their use has been restricted due to the intrinsic interference between primer pairs. Performing several single PCRs in an array format instead of a multiplex PCR is a simple way to overcome this obstacle. However. there are still major technical challenges in designing a new generation of single PCR microreactors with a small sample volume. rapid thermal cycling. and no evaporation during amplification. We report a simple and robust core-shell bead array for a series of single amplifications. Four core-shell beads with a polymer coating and PCR mixture were synthesized using liquid marble formation and subsequent photo polymerization. Each bead can detect one target gene. We constructed a customised system for thermal cycling of these core-shell beads. Phylogrouping of the E. coli strains was carried out based on the fluorescent signal of the core-shell beads. This platform can be a promising alternative for multiplex nucleic acid analyses due to its simplicity and high throughput. The platform reported here also reduces the cycling time and avoids evaporation as well as contamination of the sample during the amplification process.

Due to the presence of organic groups. these organicinorganic silicone powders show higher flexibility and compatibility with the skin than inorganic spherical silica powders. The characteristics of these silicone powders are greatly affected by the crosslinlking density in the silicone network. Silicone resin powders are characterized by very high crosslinking density. Due to their rigid mechanical response. silicone resin powders show relatively hard touch feelings and high fluidity. On the other hand. due to relatively low crosslinking density. silicone rubber powders show a lot of interesting characteristics such as elasticity. soft touch feelings and high oil absorption. However. it is too agglomerative to be formulated into a pressed powder foundation. The improvement of fluidity of silicone rubber powders. such as silicone rubber powders coated with silicone resin [INCI: VINYL DIMETHICONE/METHICONE SILSESQUIOXANE CROSSPOLYMER (VDMSC beads)] 4) have been studied.

The use of higher amounts of MTMS led to coarsening of the skeletons and strengthening of the skeletal structures. giving the monoliths water resistance. When a dispersion of zirconium oxide nanoparticles and MTMS was used as the starting material. a macroporous monolith was also obtained by the same simple process. Colloidal gelation occurs because the silanol moiety is more likely to react with the colloid surface of ceramic materials than with other silanols derived from MTMS and their oligomer.

The approach demonstrated involves rationally designed fluorophore-integrated gold/silver nanoshells as SERS nanotags and utilizes alternative current electrohydrodynamic (ac-EHD)-induced nanoscaled surface shear forces to enhance the capture kinetics. The assay performance was validated in comparison with hydrodynamic flow and conventional immunoassay-based devices.

These illnesses include gastroenteritis. meningitis. encephalitis. and respiratory infections. Importantly. outbreaks of viral disease from waters deemed compliant from bacterial indicator testing still occur. which highlights the need to monitor the virological quality of water. Human adenoviruses are often used as a viral indicator of water quality (faecal contamination). as this pathogen has high UV-resistance and is prevalent in untreated domestic wastewater all year round. unlike enteroviruses and noroviruses that are often only detected in certain seasons. Standard methods for recovering and measuring adenovirus numbers in water are lacking. and there are many variations in published methods.

This study showed no consistent relationship between cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH). as determined by microbial adherence to hydrocarbons. of three Rhodococcus spp. isolated from activated sludge foam and their ability to produce a stable foam. There also appeared to be no correlation between the mycolic acid composition of these strains. in terms of chain length or degree of unsaturation. and either CSH or foaming ability.

Technological and engineering advancements in the field of microfluidics have fuelled the progress of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology in the last three decades. Advances in microfluidics-based PCR technology have significantly reduced the sample volume and thermal cycling time. Further advances led to novel and accurate techniques such as the digital PCR.

Transplantation of OECs is being trialled for repair of the paralysed spinal cord. with promising but variable results and thus the therapy needs improving. To date. studies of OEC behaviour in a multicellular environment have been hampered by the lack of suitable three-dimensional cell culture models. Here. we exploit the floating liquid marble. a liquid droplet coated with hydrophobic powder and placed on a liquid bath. The presence of the liquid bath increases the humidity and minimises the effect of evaporation. Floating liquid marbles allow the OECs to freely associate and interact to produce OEC spheroids with uniform shapes and sizes.

Microfluidic platforms that handle small amounts of liquid have been categorised as continuous-flow microfluidics and digital microfluidics. The first part of this paper discusses the recent advances of the two main and opposing applications of liquid handling in continuous-flow microfluidics: mixing and separation. Mixing and separation are essential steps in most lab-on-a-chip platforms. as sample preparation and detection are required for a variety of biological and chemical assays. The second part discusses the various digital microfluidic strategies. based on droplets and liquid marbles. for the manipulation of discrete microdroplets. More advanced digital microfluidic devices combining electrowetting with other techniques are also introduced.

A floating liquid marble is a unique reactor platform for digital microfluidics. The autonomous motion of a liquid marble is of great interest for this application because of the associated chaotic mixing inside the marble. A floating object can move by itself if a gradient of surface tension is generated in the vicinity of the object. This phenomenon is known as the Marangoni solutocapillary effect. We utilized a liquid marble containing a volatile substance such as ethanol to generate the solutocapillary effect.

Under the combined effect of gravity and surface tension. the rigid particle deforms the liquid surface. However. in the case of a floating soft particle such as a liquid marble. not only the liquid surface but also the particle itself deforms. In this paper. we investigate the deformation of a floating liquid marble and characterise its height as well as aspect ratio.

This paper reports the floating mechanism of liquid marbles. or liquid droplets coated with hydrophobic microparticles. We used X-ray computed tomography (XCT) to acquire cross-sectional images of the floating liquid marble and interface between the different phases. We then analysed the shape of the liquid marble and the angles at the three-phase contact line (TPCL). We found that the small floating liquid marbles follow the mechanism governing the flotation of solid objects in terms of surface tension forces. However. the contact angles formed and deformation of the liquid marble resemble that of a sessile liquid droplet on a thin. elastic solid.

This process is indispensable for realising microfluidic functions such as mixing and reactions at microscale. This paper reviews previous studies on droplet coalescence. paying particular attention to the coalescence of liquid marbles. Four coalescence systems have been reviewed. namely. the coalescence of two droplets freely suspended in a fluid; the coalescence of two sessile droplets on a solid substrate; the coalescence of a falling droplet and a sessile droplet on a solid substrate; and liquid marble coalescence. The review is presented according to the dynamic behaviors. physical mechanisms and experimental parameters of the coalescence process. It also provides a systematic overview of how the coalescence process of droplets and liquid marbles could be induced and manipulated using external energy. In addition. the practical applications of liquid marble coalescence as a novel microreactor are highlighted.

This paper studies the coalescence process of two equally-sized liquid marbles via vertical collision aided by dielectrophoretic handling. A liquid marble was picked up using the dielectrophoretic force and then dropped vertically onto another liquid marble resting on a hydrophobic powder bed. The whole collision process was recorded by a high-speed camera and the recorded images were then analysed to derive the generalised conditions of liquid marble coalescence.

Particle manipulation based on inertial effects requires a high flow speed and thus is well-suited to high-throughput applications. Recently. inertial focusing and separation using curvilinear microchannels has been attracting a great amount of interest because of the linear structure for parallelization. small device footprint. superior particle-focusing performance. and easy implementation of particle separation. However. the curvature directions of these microchannels alternate. leading to variations in both the magnitude and direction of the induced secondary flow.

A liquid marble is a liquid droplet coated with hydrophobic powder. Magnetite particles inside the marble make it magnetic. The marble floats on a carrier liquid that contains aqueous glycerol of various concentrations. A permanent magnet located under the carrier liquid drives the floating marble with the initial velocity. Stopping the magnet abruptly causes the marble to oscillate around its final position for a few seconds. The oscillation was recorded and analysed using customised image processing and evaluation software. The damped harmonic motion model was then applied to the data and tested.

Conventional liquid marbles are synthesized by coating liquid droplets with a thin layer of hydrophobic powder. Existing and emerging applications of liquid marbles require a contamination-free synthesis of liquid marbles with a high degree of reproducibility of their volume.

This process is indispensable for realising microfluidic functions such as mixing and reactions at microscale. This paper reviews previous studies on droplet coalescence. paying particular attention to the coalescence of liquid marbles. Four coalescence systems have been reviewed. namely. the coalescence of two droplets freely suspended in a fluid; the coalescence of two sessile droplets on a solid substrate; the coalescence of a falling droplet and a sessile droplet on a solid substrate; and liquid marble coalescence. The review is presented according to the dynamic behaviors. physical mechanisms and experimental parameters of the coalescence process. It also provides a systematic overview of how the coalescence process of droplets and liquid marbles could be induced and manipulated using external energy. In addition. the practical applications of liquid marble coalescence as a novel microreactor are highlighted. Finally. future perspectives on the investigation of the coalescence process of liquid marbles are proposed. This review aims to facilitate better understanding of the coalescence of droplets and of liquid marbles as well as to shed new insight on future studies.

However. the underlying mechanisms and critical conditions of liquid marble coalescence are not well understood. This paper studies the coalescence process of two equally-sized liquid marbles via vertical collision aided by dielectrophoretic handling.

The elastic properties of liquid marbles determine the amount of compression under a given external force. This is an important property as the elasticity of liquid marbles determines their morphology under a given stress. We show that the stress-strain relationship of liquid marbles can be described by σ*Bo=0.6[1/(1−εhro)2−1]. where Bo is the Bond number. σ* is the normalised stress. and εhr0 is the strain measured with respect to the equivalent radius of the liquid marble.

1206762,An automated on-demand liquid marble generator based on electrohydrodynamic pulling,2019,Kamalalayam Rajan Sreejith and Chin Hong Ooi and Jing Jin and Dzung Viet Dao and Nam-Trung Nguyen,90,Review of Scientific Instruments,5,055102,AIP Publishing LLC,Liquid marble is a recently emerging digital microfluidic platform with a wide range of applications. Conventional liquid marbles are synthesized by coating liquid droplets with a thin layer of hydrophobic powder. Existing and emerging applications of liquid marbles require a contamination-free synthesis of liquid marbles with a high degree of reproducibility of their volume. Despite this requirement. the synthesis of liquid marbles has been still carried out manually. Manual production of liquid marbles leads to inconsistent volume and the possibility of contamination. The synthesis of liquid marbles with submicroliter volume is difficult to achieve and prone to large errors. This paper discusses the design and development of the first automated on-demand liquid marble generator with submicroliter capability. The device utilizes electrohydrodynamic pulling of liquid droplets on to a hydrophobic powder bed and …,True,yXV_wNkAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC,6,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5094522,4169386631865445065,/scholar?cites=4169386631865445065,,https://ntnlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/J396MarbleGeneration.pdf,0,0,0

Purification of viable floating cancer cells is essential for many biomedical studies. such as drug screening and cancer model development. However. the floating cancer cells are mixed with dead cells and debris in the medium supernatant. In this paper. we developed an inertial microfluidic device with sinusoidal microchannels to continuously remove dead cells and debris from viable cells. First. we characterized the differential inertial focusing properties of polystyrene beads in the devices. Then. we investigated the effects of flow rate on inertial focusing of floating MDA-MB-231 cells.

Nevertheless. their use has been restricted due to the intrinsic interference between primer pairs. Performing several single PCRs in an array format instead of a multiplex PCR is a simple way to overcome this obstacle. However. there are still major technical challenges in designing a new generation of single PCR microreactors with a small sample volume. rapid thermal cycling. and no evaporation during amplification. We report a simple and robust core-shell bead array for a series of single amplifications. Four core-shell beads with a polymer coating and PCR mixture were synthesized using liquid marble formation and subsequent photo polymerization. Each bead can detect one target gene. We constructed a customised system for thermal cycling of these core-shell beads. Phylogrouping of the E. coli strains was carried out based on the fluorescent signal of the core-shell beads. This platform can be a promising alternative for multiplex nucleic acid analyses due to its simplicity and high throughput. The platform reported here also reduces the cycling time and avoids evaporation as well as contamination of the sample during the amplification process.

The effects of additive amounts of γ-(methacryloxy) propyltrimethoxysilane (KH-570) on quality and corrosion resistance of the formed films were studied by the potentiodynamic polarization curve. the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and so forth. Besides. films in this research were modified by hydroxyapatite (HA) and cerium ion (Ce~(3+)) and then the films' anti-corrosive quality were studied. The results show that a uniform. dense silane transparent film is formed on AZ31 B magnesium alloy after silane electrochemical-assisted deposition. which hinders corrosion behaviors of magnesium alloy effectively and reduces the corrosion current density to a great extent; there is an optimum volume of KH-570 in silane electrochemical-assisted deposition. and the best film can be got when 8 m L KH-570 is added; the quality of film formed by electrochemical-assisted depositing KH-570 can be improved further through modifying silane solutions.[Fund]: 国家自然科学基金 (31570961);; 省级条件建设与民生科技专项资金-江苏省先进金属材料高技术研究实验室项目 (BM2007204),True,yXV_wNkAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC,0,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-HKCB201604003.htm,,,,,0,0,0

In the marine environment. depth can become an important factor as declining light and water temperature leads to changes in the biological habitat structure. To date. much of the focus of ecological fish research has been based on reefs in less than 40 m with little research on the ecological role of mesophotic reefs. We deployed baited remote underwater stereo video systems (stereo-BRUVS) on temperate reefs in two depth categories: shallow (20–40 m) and mesophotic (80–120 m). off Port Stephens. Australia. Sites were selected using data collected by swath acoustic sounder to ensure stereo-BRUVS were deployed on reef. The sounder also provided rugosity. slope and relief data for each stereo-BRUVS deployment. Multivariate analysis indicates that there are significant differences in the fish assemblages between shallow and mesophotic reefs. primarily driven by Ophthalmolepis lineolatus and Notolabrus gymnogenis only occurring on shallow reefs and schooling species of fish that were unique to each depth category: Atypichthys strigatus on shallow reefs and Centroberyx affinis on mesophotic reefs. While shallow reefs had a greater species richness and abundance of fish when compared to mesophotic reefs. mesophotic reefs hosted the same species richness of fishery-targeted species.

Nonetheless. alternative metrics such as functional traits have recently been shown to be useful complementary measures for detecting biological change. Timely conservation planning often precludes the collection of such detailed biological data relying instead on remotely-sensed habitat mapping as a surrogate for diversity. While there is evidence that habitat maps may predict taxonomic species richness and diversity in some coastal ecosystems. it is unknown whether similar strong relationships exist for functional traits and functional multimetrics.

The lattice of these anodes during continuous lithiation undergoes expansion followed by a gradual contraction and then expansion again. The measured lattice parameter changes were reconciled with Li occupation at specific sites within the Li4Ti5O12 crystal structure. where Li migrates from the 8a to 16c sites. Despite these similar Li-diffusion pathways. in …,True,hFtUb7AAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,78,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cm5002779,15511553941398756046,/scholar?cites=15511553941398756046,,https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3313&context=eispapers,0,0,0

Br. I) are a promising class of fast-ion conductors for all-solid state Li-ion batteries. To gain a deeper insight into the phase formation of Li6PS5Cl. in situ neutron diffraction studies are carried out on a stoichiometric ball-milled precursor mixture during thermal treatment. The evolution of the S2 −/Cl− anion disorder and its correlation with ionic conductivity are reported here. In contrast to earlier reports. an argyrodite phase is found to form between 80 and 150 °C. but the phase shows only moderate conductivity when crystallized at such low temperatures and further thermal treatment is required to access the highly conducting phase. The maximum room-temperature ionic conductivity of 1.1 × 10− 3 S/cm is observed for samples annealed at intermediate temperatures (250 °C).

The reaction kinetics were well-described by an Avrami-derived model for the nucleation and growth regime during early hydration times and a diffusion-limited model for later periods. This study showed that the hydration reaction is not a simple linear combination of the reactions for the individual components. Compressive strength tests correlated with the neutron scattering data. suggesting that the details of the interaction affect the microstructure and therefore the strength of the product. Results suggest that favorable reaction mechanics provide optimal strength when an 80−95% tricalcium silicate and 20−5% dicalcium silicate mixture is used. ,True,hFtUb7AAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,76,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp052147o,16595070118080319549,/scholar?cites=16595070118080319549,,,0,0,0

This rate of crystallization increases with increasing supersaturation ratio of glucose and viscosity. The former of these factors dominate at temperatures below 15 C. whilst the latter factor dominates at temperatures above 15 C (Venir et al.. 2010). Commercial honey processing methods such as heating (significantly above 15 C). decrease viscosity and thus successfully decrease the rate of crystallization of honey (Turhan et al.. 2008). and are also responsible for the production of undesirable compounds that reduce honey quality (Ajlouni and Sujirapinyokul. 2010).

In samples with random grain orientations. we found that the thermal conductivity can be decreased by making grain size smaller through ball milling and hot pressing. but the power factor decreased with a similar percentage. resulting in no gain in ZT. Reorienting the ab planes of the small crystals by repressing the as-pressed samples enhanced the peak ZT from 0.85 to 1.04 at about 125 °C. a 22% improvement. mainly due to the more increase on power factor than on thermal conductivity.

Ltd.,Hydrogen is considered a good energy carrier candidate for future automotive applications that could be part of a carbon‐free cycle. Metal hydrides are often preferred over pressurized gas and other hydrogen storage methods because of their gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities and safe operating pressures. In addition to the hydrogen storage capacity. other properties that have often been disregarded must now be addressed before hydrogen storage in metal hydrides becomes feasible. The slow hydriding/dehydriding kinetics. high release temperature. low storage efficiency due to the high enthalpy of formation. and thermal management during the hydriding reaction remain important difficulties in meeting the objectives set by the Department of Energy (DOE) for hydrogen storage systems.

The consistency of the results obtained is demonstrated using two α-alumina samples that have different total surface areas. When the proposed method is applied to convert the amount adsorbed per unit mass to the amount adsorbed per unit area. we show that there is no measurable difference between their adsorption isotherms. Also. we show the proposed method can be applied to six different powders having a variation in their specific surface areas of two orders of magnitude.

Symmetric two-stage systems utilizing an image-forming primary parabolic concentrator in tandem with a nonimaging secondary concentrator partially overcome this compactness problem. but their achievable concentration ratio is ultimately limited by the central obstruction caused by the secondary. Significant improvements can be realized by two-stage systems having asymmetric cross-sections. particularly for 2D line-focus trough designs.

While a concentrator with a parabolic cross-section indeed achieves this limit. it is not the only geometry capable of doing so. We demonstrate that there are infinitely many solutions. The significance of this finding is that geometries which can be more easily constructed than the parabola can be utilized without loss of concentration. thus presenting new avenues for reducing the cost of solar collectors.

1206976,High-concentration solar trough collectors and their application to concentrating photovoltaics,2014,Thomas A Cooper,,,,,,Due to the dilute nature of the solar radiation reaching the surface of the earth. the greatest power output that can be generated by any solar collector is around 1 kW per m2 of collecting aperture. Minimization of the cost per m2 of collecting aperture is therefore considered to be a major driver in achieving a cost-competitive system. Due to their line symmetry. solar trough collectors have a low-cost construction and are highly-scalable. making them good candidates for achieving this primary goal. However. this line symmetry restricts the achievable solar concentration to at most 215×. thus limiting range of useful applications and the efficiency of downstream processes. This work investigates ways in which this concentration limit can be broken through the introduction of a novel secondary concentrator stage. while still maintaining the benefits of having a line-symmetric primary concentrator. Thus the concept of the high-concentration solar trough collector is introduced. The starting point for a high-concentration solar trough collector should be a low-cost. high-performance trough. For this purpose. a construction based on inflated polymer membranes mounted on a rigid concrete structure is considered. The mirror comprises a stack of N polymer membranes. the topmost membrane being metallized to form the reflector surface. When appropriately dimensioned and inflated. the top membrane assumes the shape of N tangentially connected circular arcs whose shape has been denoted the “arcspline”.

Recently. floating structures for solar evaporation have been proposed. employing the concept of interfacial solar heat localization as a high-efficiency approach to desalination.

1207007,Photoacoustic measurement of bandgaps of thermoelectric materials,2014,George Wei Ni,,,,,,Thermoelectric materials are a promising class of direct energy conversion materials. usually consisting of highly doped semiconductors. The key to maximizing their thermal to electrical energy conversion lies in optimizing three inter-related material properties. thermal conductivity. electrical conductivity. and Seebeck coefficient. All three properties are affected by the carrier concentration of the thermoelectric material. In practice. tedious trial-and-error testing is needed to determine the optimal carrier concentration for the maximum figure-of-merit. ZT. Theory and computer simulations of thermoelectric properties can aid the determination of new thermoelectric materials. but several challenges remain. The bandgap is a key piece of bandstructure information. but is difficult to determine for heavily doped thermoelectric materials. Under heavy doping conditions. the effective mass and bandgap both change due to the formation of Urbach band tails and other defect states within the bandgap. Furthermore. bandgaps of heavily doped materials are difficult to observe optically. due to significant amounts of carriers in defects states within the bandgap. Conventional optical measurement techniques relying on transmittance change require extremely thin samples. on the order of microns for thermoelectrics. Photoacoustic spectroscopy is used in this work to optically probe the thermoelectric bandgap. without the need to produce thin samples. Photoacoustic spectroscopy allows simultaneous measurements of the thermal conductivity and optical absorption coefficient.

Based on an exergy analysis. a computer program has been developed to investigate improving the performance of an ABC cycle by calculating the irreversibility in the corresponding devices of the system. In this study. we suggest two new cycles where an air bottoming cycle along with the steam injection are used. These cycles are: the Evaporating Gas turbine with Air Bottoming Cycle (EGT-ABC). and Steam Injection Gas turbine with Air Bottoming Cycle (STIG-ABC). The results of the model show that in these cycles. more energy recovery and higher air inlet mass flow rate translate into an increase of the efficiency and output turbine work. The EGT-ABC was found to have a lower irreversibility and higher output work when compared to the STIG-ABC.

A numerical approach is used to model the solid-liquid interactions in presence of a free-surface. The governing equations for the 3D incompressible fluid flow are continuity and Navier-Stokes equations along with an equation for the free surface advection. To track the free-surface motion. the fast-fictitious-domain method is integrated into the volume-of-fluid (VOF) technique. The governing equations are solved everywhere in the computational domain including the horizontal cylinder. A rigid body motion is applied to the region occupied by the circular cylinder.

The droplet impact velocity (10-50 m s-1) and the average roughness (0.03 or 0.23 μm) of the test surfaces were varied. The stainless steel substrate was mounted on the end of a rotating arm. giving linear velocities of up to 50 m s-1. Different stages of droplet impact were photographed by synchronizing the ejection of a single droplet with the position of the rotating arm and triggering of a camera.

Temperatures. velocities. and sizes of spray particles were recorded while in-flight and held constant during experiments. We measured coating adhesion strength and porosity. photographed coating microstructure. and determined thickness and composition of surface oxide layers on heated substrates. Coating adhesion strength on stainless steel coupons increased from 10–74 MPa when substrate temperatures were raised from 25–650 °C. Coating porosity was lower on high-temperature surfaces. Surface oxide layers grew thicker when substrates were heated. but oxidation alone could not account for the increase in coating adhesion strength.

It is emphasized that in general this velocity cannot be approximated by the velocity of any material point. even when the point is very close to the contact line. The algorithm was implemented into a two-phase flow model. The model. which is two-dimensional axisymmetric. uses the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. The model was used to simulate the spreading of drops impacting a dry solid surface at low Weber numbers.

It is shown that the extent of maximum spread is primarily determined by the Reynolds number and. to a lesser degree. by the Weber number.

However. the complex and nonlinear behavior of multiphase microfluidic devices and several parameters affecting droplet size simultaneously necessitates costly design iterations to generate droplets with the radius of interest for a certain application. To address this. we exploit soft computing methods to bridge fuzzy systems and neural networks in order to build an adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that predicts the droplet size generated in a flow-focusing microfluidic device based on six major parameters. that includes geometry. flow. and fluid properties.

In this way. the performance will be very suitable for the systems which are naturally complicated for deriving the differential equations. This can be a good alternative to other control areas. One of the main disadvantages of this method is considering the discrete actions during it. However. many of dynamical systems couldn't be optimized by this approach. To remedy this deficiency. different approaches have emerged. including approximate methods. In this paper. fuzzy logic is used to continually optimize the operations.

However. it was previously determined that localised forms of PCa shed a small number of cancer cells into the bloodstream. and a large volume of blood is required just for a single test. which is impractical. To address this issue. urine has been used as an alternative to blood for liquid biopsy as a truly non-invasive. patient-friendly test. To this end. we developed a spiral microfluidic chip capable of isolating PCa cells from the urine of PCa patients. Potential clinical utility of the chip was demonstrated using anti-Glypican-1 (GPC-1) antibody as a model of the primary antibody in immunofluorescent assay for identification and detection of the collected tumour cells. The microchannel device was first evaluated using DU-145 cells in a diluted Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline sample. where it demonstrated> 85 (±6)% efficiency. The microchannel proved to be functional in at least 79% of cases for capturing GPC1+ putative tumour cells from the urine of patients with localised PCa. More importantly. a correlation was found between the amount of the captured GPC1+ cells and crucial diagnostic and prognostic parameter of localised PCa—Gleason score.

Design of micromixers with gaps and baffles to increase the mixing efficiency is crucial in various biological applications such as DNA analysis. The arrangement of gaps and baffles significantly affects the fluid flow structure and mixing. In some cases. arrangement of obstacles outweigh design of framework. The effects of four design parameters are investigated on two important characteristics of a mixer namely mixing efficiency and pressure drop. A weighted profit function is defined to combine these two characteristics. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to simulate the fluid flow and mixing in three-dimensional models. For this numerical study. the commercial CFD package. COMSOL. is used. The analyses of the numerical results are then shown in signal to noise (S/N) ratio plots indicating which combination of parameters leads to a maximum profit.

Owing to the lack of vaccine and effective treatments. many countries have been overwhelmed with an exponential spread of the virus and surge in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Current standard diagnostic methods are inadequate for widespread testing as they suffer from prolonged turn-around times (> 12 h) and mostly rely on high-biosafety-level laboratories and well-trained technicians. Point-of-care (POC) tests have the potential to vastly improve healthcare in several ways. ranging from enabling earlier detection and easier monitoring of disease to reaching remote populations. In recent years. the field of POC diagnostics has improved markedly with the advent of micro-and nanotechnologies. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic. POC technologies have been rapidly innovated to address key limitations faced in existing standard diagnostic methods. This review summarizes and compares the latest available POC immunoassay. nucleic acid-based and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-(CRISPR)-mediated tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection that we anticipate aiding healthcare facilities to control virus infection and prevent subsequent spread.

In this modeling the holes are considered as short ducts and the junctions of hole-cavity and hole-pipe interface are simulated as T-junctions (in the duct-system method). The dissipative effect of absorptance material is modeled by two methods; the constant distributed pressure loss (f model) and the variable distributed pressure loss (R) models in the absorptive silencers. These two methods are compared with the concentric and constant distributed pressure loss (kf) model. Comparison of numerical and experimental results shows that the extension of the duct-system model to complex perforates is possible.

One of the fundamental operations that microfluidic devices must achieve is a high mixing index. Of particular importance is the role of planar mixing units with repetitive obstacles (MURO) in the formation of micromixers. To date. a myriad of planar passive micromixers has been proposed. However. a strategy for the combination of these units to find an efficient planar mixer has not been investigated. As such. five different MURO have been selected to form a “hybrid micromixer.” and their combination was evaluated via numerical and experimental methods. These mixing units include ellipse-like.

Iranian Society Of Mechanical Engineers,Micromixers are one of the most crucial components of Lab-On-a-Chip devices with the intention of mixing and dispersion of reagents like small molecules and particles. The challenge facing micromixers is typically insufficient mixing efficiency in basic designs. which results in longer microchannels. Therefore. it is desirable to increase mixing efficiency. in order to decrease mixing length. which enables miniaturization of Lab-On-Chip devices.  This study investigates two different designs of a passive T-shaped micromixer employing several rectangular obstacles and grooves to monitor mixing efficiency with geometry change. while keeping the Reynolds number under 2. The mixing performance of these geometries is studied by numerical study and it was implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics environment. It was clarified that T-shaped micromixer with obstacles and grooved micromixer improved mixing efficiency of the basic design by 37.2% and 43.8%. respectively. Also. it was shown that this increase in mixing efficiency was due to the development of transversal component of flow caused by the obstacles and grooves.,True,2wCxIfkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,23,http://tpnms.usb.ac.ir/article_2034_293.html,12970672338919932604,/scholar?cites=12970672338919932604,,http://tpnms.usb.ac.ir/article_2034_da536b7d34c59c483fcc918b9404b52e.pdf,0,0,0

Type one diabetes is taken into consideration as a nonlinear model (Augmented Minimal Model). which is implemented in MATLAB-SIMULINK. This Model is developed in consideration of the patient's conditions. There are some uncertainties in the regarded model due to factors such as blood glucose concentration. daily meals or sudden stresses. Moreover. there are distinct approaches toward the elimination of these uncertainties. In here. a meal is fed to the model as an input in order to omit these uncertainties. Also. different control methods could be chosen to monitor the blood glucose level. In this paper. a Fractional Order PID is utilized as the control method. Thereafter. the control method and parameters are tuned by conducting genetic algorithm. as a powerful evolutionary algorithm. Finally. the output of the optimized Fractional order PID and traditional PID control method. which had the same parameters as the Fractional PID except the fractions. are compared.

In the present study. tracking of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was achieved by chemically linking it to photoluminescent carbon dots (CDs). Carbon dots were synthesized by the hydrothermal method and. subsequently. conjugated with VEGF using carbodiimide coupling.

Four 2D models of tissue have been created: tissue itself. tissue including a tumor (TIT). tissue including a healthy artery (TIHA). and tissue including a stenotic artery (TISA). After solving four models with similar boundary conditions and loadings. the 2D tactile mappings and stress graphs for upper nodes of models. which have key importance for transferring tactile data. were explored. Then. by comparing these results. if the stress values of nodes were constant and equal. tissue is unlikely to have any tumor or artery embedded. Otherwise. if the stress graph included a peak. the tissue had a tumor or an artery. Additionally. it was observed that the stress graph of tissue including an artery is time-dependent in comparison with the tissue including a tumor.

The most long-standing approach of AAA treatment is open surgery. at which large incisions are necessary. Drawbacks of open surgery lead to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) of aortic repair. whose main problem is that cross-clamping process is too time consuming. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is new approach of AAA treatment. During a HALS. the surgeon takes advantage of his/her fingers and tactile feedback and. as a result. the cross-clamping time would reduce significantly. However. the additional required incision. the space that surgeon's hand would take up. and the possibility of hand fatigue. are some drawbacks that result in the HALS not to be so popular.

Since the microprocessor technology is developing with a fast rate. conventional cooling methods for integrated circuits will eventually fail to address the needs for high performance computers. As a result. novel methods of cooling must be developed.

This layer is composed of an array of liquid metal drops which can be actuated with the electrowetting phenomenon. The conductivity of this layer can be modified according to the heat transfer requirements of the system in the desired region. This action is accomplished by actuating the drop in that region with an applied AC voltage. To test the possibility of designing such a system. experimental and numerical investigations with different scenarios have been presented and compared in this paper.

Conical torch performance has been evaluated considering: (i) plasma fundamental properties; (ii) plasma robustness; (iii) carbon-based background emission; and (iv) analytical figures of merit. For the sake of comparison. a Fassel torch has been employed as a reference. Results show that the discharge for the Conical torch is highly robust and plasma characteristics (i.e.. excitation temperature and electron number density) are mostly unaffected by the introduction of pure and hydroalcoholic solutions of methanol and 1-propanol.

The objective of this thesis is to investigate whether this geometry can provide reduced gas  power consumption and a higher quantity of spheroidized (i.e.. melted) particles. The investigation is conducted using computational fluid dynamic simulations in ANSYS Fluent by simulating the injection of powder particles into the plasma discharge produced by the RF-ICP torch. Simulations are performed to optimize the conical torch and compare its performance to a conventional RF-ICP torch. It is found that the new conical torch achieves spheroidization ratios up to 2 times higher than the conventional torch. due to higher temperatures and an induction zone closer to particles. Additionally. it runs at 42% lower gas consumption and can achieve industrially acceptable spheroidization ratios at half the power level of the conventional torch.,True,LWI7LxQAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/103000,,,,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/103000/3/Mirek_Patrick_M_201911_MAS_thesis.pdf,0,0,0

Thermal shrinkage is a phenomenon caused by variation of density during solidification and cooling down of molten metal. The Navier-Stokes equations along with the energy equation including phase change are solved using a 2-D axisymmetric mesh. We used the VOF method. applied to the fixed Eulerian mesh. to track the free surface of the droplet. For solidification. we used an enthalpy-porosity formulation. The simulations performed in this study are accomplished using both a commercial code (FLUENT) and an inhouse developed program. The results of these scenarios are presented: the normal impacts of 2.7 mm spherical tin droplets at 1m/s and 2m/s. initially at 240 C. onto a 27 C steel substrate. It is seen that when the droplet impacts to the substrate with 1m/s velocity. it spreads and solidifies and during the recoil of the droplet. a single cavity forms within the splat which is the source of porosity and is caused by shrinkage.,True,LWI7LxQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://profdoc.um.ac.ir/paper-abstract-1018148.html,,,,,0,0,0

1207261,The influence of nanofluid pH on natural convection,2016,K Kouloulias and A Sergis and I Hardalupas,,,,,,The vast majority of experimental studies of nanofluids under natural convection have shown that the heat transfer rate decreases in contrast to observations of increased heat transfer rate for forced convection and boiling heat transfer. This surprising result has not been fully understood and the purpose of this study is to shed light on the physics behind the decrease of heat transfer in Al2O3 – deionised (DI) H2O nanofluids under natural convection. A classical Rayleigh-Benard configuration has been employed. where the test medium is heated from the bottom and cooled from the top of an optically accessible chamber. while the sidewalls are insulated. Al2O3 – H2O nanofluids with nanoparticle concentration within the range of 0.03 to 0.12 vol. % are used and tested under turbulent natural convection. Rayleigh number Ra ~ 109. until steady state conditions are reached. For the synthesis of the nanofluid. pure DI water and high purity nanopowder. supplied by two different vendors. are involved with and without adopting the electrostatic stabilization method. The temperature measurements at different locations around the chamber allow the quantification of the natural convection heat transfer coefficient and the corresponding Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers. All the measured quantities are compared with those for DI water that serves as a benchmark in this study. It is found that the presence of nanoparticles systematically decreases the heat transfer performance of the base fluid under natural convection.

1207262,Natural convection and pool boiling studies of nanofluids,2017,Konstantinos Kouloulias,,,,,,The present PhD thesis sheds light on the physical mechanisms behind nanofluids. by investigating experimentally the heat and mass transfer behaviour of nanofluids under natural convection and pool boiling heat transfer. Nanofluids represent a new class of heat transfer fluids. engineered by dispersing and stably suspending nanoparticles in traditional heat transfer fluids. Nanoparticles have the potential to considerably enhance the heat transfer performance of the base fluids. in concentrations starting from as low as 0.0001 vol.%. with theoretically limited drawbacks compared to milli- or micron-sized particles. Despite the reported promising characteristics of nanofluids. the physics of the underlying processes have not yet thoroughly been established and a controversy exists concerning their capability and applicability in engineering applications.  With respect to natural convection heat transfer in a Rayleigh-Bénard cell. it was found that the presence of Al2O3 nanoparticles in deionised water. decreases the heat transfer coefficient of the base fluid. due to the sedimentation of nanoparticles. as a consequence of poor nanofluid stability. Meanwhile. it was shown that when nanofluids that exhibit acidic behaviour are used. the attained stability is superior. and the heat transfer deterioration is minimal. By using a laser-based velocimetry technique. it was found that the presence of a minute amount of Al2O3 nanoparticles in deionised water significantly alters its mass transfer behaviour in the bulk region of turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection.

During the last 30 years. different methods and software have been developed to measure a thermal building's demand. Building performance simulation is commonly used to calculate heating and cooling demand. However. such techniques do not adequately include the urban heat island effect. which could have an extreme impact on a building's energy consumption.

Some impacts of climate change. such as high temperatures in urban environments. have not yet been addressed through adaptation strategies. which are based on poorly supported data. These impacts remain outside the scope of urban planning. New spatially explicit approaches that identify highly vulnerable urban areas and include specific adaptation requirements are needed in current urban planning practices to cope with heat hazards. In this paper. a heat vulnerability index is proposed for Santiago. Chile. The index was created using a GIS-based spatial information system and was constructed from spatially explicit indexes for exposure. sensitivity and adaptive capacity levels derived from remote sensing data and socio-economic information assessed via principal component analysis (PCA). The objective of this study is to determine the levels of heat vulnerability at local scales by providing insights into these indexes at the intra city scale. The results reveal a spatial pattern of heat vulnerability with strong variations among individual spatial indexes. While exposure and adaptive capacities depict a clear spatial pattern. sensitivity follows a complex spatial distribution. These conditions change when examining PCA results. showing that sensitivity is more robust than exposure and adaptive capacity. These indexes can be used both for urban planning purposes and for proposing specific policies and measures that can help minimize heat hazards in highly dynamic urban areas.

The performance of the adaptive model included in CEN Standard EN15251 and the traditional PMV model are compared with reports of thermal environment satisfaction surveys presented simultaneously to all occupants of the office to determine which of the two comfort models is most suitable to evaluate the thermal environment. The results indicate that office occupants have developed some degree of adaptation to the climatic conditions of the city where the office is located (which only demands heating operation). and tend to accept and even prefer lower operative temperatures than those considered optimum by applying the PMV model. This is an indication that occupants of naturally conditioned buildings are usually able to match their comfort temperature to their normal environment. Therefore. the application of the adaptive model included in CEN Standard EN15251 seems like the optimal approach for evaluating thermal comfort in naturally conditioned buildings. because it takes into consideration the adaptive principle that indicates that if a change occurs such as to produce discomfort. people tend to react in ways which restore their comfort.

1207273,Robust design: A way to control energy use from human behavior in architectural spaces,2006,M Palme and A Isalgue and H Coch and R Serra,,Proceedings of the PLEA Conference,,,,Human behaviour is an important factor to consider in making an accurate assessment of the thermal exchanges between a building and its surroundings. The actions of a building’s users. such as opening windows or doors. resetting the default temperatures of heating or cooling systems. or turning on electrical lights or appliances. can have a significant effect on energy consumption and the subsequent sensation of comfort. Basing our work on schemes for classifying these actions. in this study we determine which ones are to have precedence over the others. The effects of these actions can then be computed based on energy transfer equations for different types of buildings. An analysis of the changes caused by users to thermal parameters shows that different design solutions lead to different sensitivities. The stability of the thermal transfer in the building is analysed in part. From the results. it seems reasonable to limit what actions users can carry out by making appropriate design choices. The system is thus “robust” in its response to users’ actions while it continues to provide them with the feeling that they are in control. This work emphasises the importance of the concept of “robustness” of energy efficiency and comfort in building design. Robust design here refers to the design process as a whole. carried out in such a way that it is difficult for users to make inappropriate decisions. This is accomplished by permanently sealing windows. or installing mechanisms to control lighting. heating. cooling or ventilation systems.,True,Jqxs9HcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,17,https://www.academia.edu/download/53370809/Robust_design_a_way_to_control_energy_us20170602-10337-1uor5qs.pdf,7460209187462315140,/scholar?cites=7460209187462315140,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53370809/Robust_design_a_way_to_control_energy_us20170602-10337-1uor5qs.pdf,0,0,0

However. the lifetime of a building can be over 100 years and the climate is changing rapidly. This work investigates the impact of climate change future (2040 and 2070) on the energy consumption of residential buildings recently constructed. under three possible scenarios. The scenarios are created considering a low. medium or strong effect of global warming. Two types of buildings. with comparable consumption results of today. are investigated in three different cities around the world with a multi-zone type 56 of Trnsys simulation tool. At the end of the work. the concepts of energy robustness and global thermal effusivity of buildings are discussed as important strategies to reduce the possible impact of climate change on the built environment.

1207279,Analysis and optimization of the thermal performance of social housing construction materials in Ecuador,2016,Andres Gallardo and David Beltran and Massimo Palme and Andrea Lobato and Geovanna Villacreses,,,,,,Social housing policies in Latin America have focused on reducing the quantitative housing deficit. ignoring the qualitative characteristics of the dwellings. In the case of Ecuador. this situation has caused a serious inattention to the quality of social housing. which is mainly due to the lack of regulations on energy efficiency in buildings and the lack of standards that provide minimum requirements for acceptable thermal indoor environments. The social dwelling assessed in this study is constructed with the same building materials in every region of Ecuador despite the different climatic conditions. For this reason. this type of housing does not meet minimum living conditions related to thermal comfort. which is why they become part of the qualitative housing deficit.

Cham,Global warming affects the built environment by changing the environmental conditions under which buildings operate. This change probably means a shift in thermal demand. from a predominant demand for heating to a higher demand for cooling in many climates. For instance. in cold climates global warming seems to be a self-decreasing phenomenon because of lower energy demand in warmer environments. In warmer climates. like the Mediterranean. and in the hottest climates (both humid and arid). global warming must be regarded as one of the main factors (the others are the change in comfort standards and the heat-island effect) in increasing the energy demand to cool buildings.

1207289,Energy consumption and robustness of buildings,2010,Massimo Palme and Antonio Isalgué and Helena Coch and Rafael Serra,,Proceedings of the CESB10 Conference,,,,Building energy performance depends on various parameters. which may be classified as: climatic. constructive. systems-dependent and users-dependent. The users-dependent parameters are relevant determining the building consumption. Especially in extreme climates. wrong actions of the users can generate pernicious effects that can be regarded as bifurcations in the physical dynamical system representing the building. In this work a new concept is proposed: the energy robustness of the building. An energy-robust building means a building which has the ability to mitigate the unpredictable variations caused by users or by external factors (for instance. malfunctions of systems. changes in meteorological conditions). Depending on construction typology. materials selection. control system functioning. a building can have a very different robustness: in some constructions a user action (for instance. let a door open) generates an important consumption variation. and in others this would not happen. A robustness indicator is searched from the sensitivity vector and the thermal global effusivity. Tree phases of analysis (heuristic evaluation. software simulation. monitoring) of a case study are presented as confirmation of the hypothesis. Case study building locates in the Catalan Pyrenees. in a mountain climate characterized by low external temperature in winter and high solar radiation levels. Building was projected and constructed with energy-saving concepts and strategies. Otherwise. real consumption and sensation of comfort are not the expected ones. and the cause is the relevance of the user-dependent variations that continuously move …,True,Jqxs9HcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,9,http://www.cesb.cz/cesb10/papers/2_energy/124.pdf,6607855167181612670,/scholar?cites=6607855167181612670,,http://www.cesb.cz/cesb10/papers/2_energy/124.pdf,0,0,0

Recuperado de https://www. researchgate. net/publication/308255787_ Estimating_the_Urban_Heat_Island_Effect_in_the_City_of_Guayaquil,,,,Urban Heat Island effect (UHI) is a very important study aspect regarding the future of tropical cities. Guayaquil is the most populated city of Ecuador and leads on the river Guayas. close to the Pacific Ocean. in a very hot humid climatic emplacement. The climate of Guayaquil affects drastically the built environment. especially regarding the cooling demand of buildings and the related electricity consumption. In the future. cooling needs are expected to increase: predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the atmosphere temperature will rise up to 6 C to the end of the century in this region. so the temperatures are expected to increase in at least 4 C to the middle of the century and 8 C to the end of the century. Moreover. all the South-American countries are experimenting a period of fast economic growth and people are continuously increasing their acquisitive power. Today. only a 15% of the built environment of Guayaquil uses air-conditioning to cool inside. but it is very probable that in the future there will be a significant increase in the use of active systems by the people in their homes and workplaces.

1207291,Energy labeling of residential buildings in Chile: comparing steady-state evaluations and dynamical simulation results,2015,Massimo Palme and Amanda Vásquez,,"Proceedings of the Building Simulation Conference,(Hyderabad, India",,,,Steady-state evaluations are commonly used in energy labelling for residential buildings in many countries. considering that simplified methods are sufficiently accurate to reach mandatory levels of energy demand or emissions of greenhouse gases. However. in some climates (especially the arid and the continental climates) steady-state evaluations are leading to results that differ enormously from experimental data. In this paper dynamical simulation results for three different test buildings. obtained by using official tool for energy certification of dwellings in Chile. CCTE (based DOE-2). are compared with steady-state official methodology results for six different locations in Chile. These locations are representative examples of the climate range of the country: Santiago (continental with dry summer). Antofagasta (arid with abundant cloudiness). Calama(arid). Valparaiso (Mediterranean). Concepción (cold humid) and Punta Arenas (extreme cold). Selected test buildings are representative of the built environment of Chile. Results show that climates with the highest daily temperature oscillations (arid and continental) present significant differences between steady-state and dynamic simulations results.

Additionally. double streams of impinging droplets at different impact spacings and impact angles were investigated. The optimum spacing between adjacent droplet streams was found to reduce droplet-to-droplet collision and splashing. resulting in enhanced heat transfer and better use of the cooling fluid.,True,6CIDLBkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,17,"http://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/6a7c7e10642258cc,0a3b96ef4b12165c,1f07a20f1a0b71e5.html",6372210543279497264,/scholar?cites=6372210543279497264,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Taolue_Zhang/publication/270474397_Effects_of_single_and_double_streams_of_droplet_impingements_on_surface_cooling/links/56818be008aebccc4e0be3ea.pdf,0,0,0

Alvarado and Jayaveera Muthusamy and Anoop Kanjirakat and Reza Sadr,,,,,American Society of Thermal and Fluids Engineers,A study of surface flow hydrodynamics and heat transfer caused by triple streams of impinging droplets arranged in a triangular array is presented. HFE-7100 was used as cooling liquid due to its low saturation point and dielectric properties. specifically tailored for electronic cooling applications. Triple streams of monodispersed droplets were produced using a piezoelectric droplet generator with the ability to adjust parameters such as droplet Weber number and spacing between adjacent droplet streams. A thin layer of Indium Tin Oxide was coated on a translucent sapphire substrate. which was used as a heating element. High speed and infrared imaging techniques were used to characterize the hydrodynamics and heat transfer of micro-scale surface flows. Surface jet-like fluid flows were observed among the impact craters during the high frequency droplet impingement process. A transition from laminar-like to turbulent-like surface jet flows was observed by increasing droplet Weber number or decreasing horizontal impact spacing. An empirical correlation has been postulated capable of predicting the transition of surface jet flows. The effects of surface jet flow regimes on heat transfer performance are discussed. It has been found that neither strong turbulent-like nor weak laminar-like surface jet flows are favorable for heat transfer. Experimental results show that strong turbulent-like surface jet flows lead to liquid splashing. while weak laminar-like surface jet flows result in accumulation of heated liquid.

1207306,Study of Hydrodynamics and Heat Transfer Induced by Multiple Droplet Train Impingements,2017,Taolue Zhang,,,,,,Recently. spray cooling heat transfer has received considerable attention due to its ability to dissipate high thermal loads. However. the physical mechanisms of spray cooling remain not well-understood due to the complexity of sprays. In order to better understand the underlying physical mechanisms found in spray cooling. a number of studies have been conducted by isolating spray parameters and focusing on well-controlled droplet train impingement cooling schemes. Most of the previous droplet train impingement studies have mainly focused on the thermal performance of single. double and collinearly arranged triple droplet train impingement. In the current study. the heat transfer and hydrodynamic characteristics of various droplet train impingement arrays have been investigated experimentally.   A piezo-electric droplet generation system has been designed and constructed. which is capable of producing well-controlled droplet trains arranged in various patterns (single. double. triangulated and hexagonal-arranged droplet trains). A translucent sapphire substrate. which was coated with a thin film ITO (Indium Tin Oxide). has been used as a heater in experiments. Well-calibrated high speed optical camera and IR thermal camera have been used to characterize the hydrodynamics and heat transfer of droplet train impingement.

The better thermal performance of droplet train impingement was attributed to the periodic droplet-induced crown propagation nature. which improves the heat transfer process and liquid usage efficiency.

The effects of droplet parameters such as droplet impingement frequency. droplet diameter and droplet impingement velocity on hydrodynamics and heat transfer have been evaluated experimentally. Numerically. ANSYS-Fluent was employed to simulate the droplet impingement process using Volume of Fluid model coupled with the Level Set method (CLS-VOF). A dynamic mesh adaption was used in the simulations. which is capable of capturing the propagation of droplet-induced crown with high spatial and temporal resolutions. A good agreement was reached between experimental and numerical data in terms of droplet-induced crown morphology and surface temperatures. It was observed that low Weber number (< 280) droplet impingements resulted in smooth spreading of the droplet-induced crown while splashing was observed at high Weber number (> 489) cases. The effect of spreading-splashing transition on surface heat transfer has also been investigated for fixed flow rate conditions. Time-averaged temperature measurements indicate that heat flux-surface temperature curves are linear at low surface temperature and before the onset of dry-out.

Recuperado de https://www. researchgate. net/publication/308255787_ Estimating_the_Urban_Heat_Island_Effect_in_the_City_of_Guayaquil,,,,Urban Heat Island effect (UHI) is a very important study aspect regarding the future of tropical cities. Guayaquil is the most populated city of Ecuador and leads on the river Guayas. close to the Pacific Ocean. in a very hot humid climatic emplacement. The climate of Guayaquil affects drastically the built environment. especially regarding the cooling demand of buildings and the related electricity consumption. In the future. cooling needs are expected to increase: predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the atmosphere temperature will rise up to 6 C to the end of the century in this region. so the temperatures are expected to increase in at least 4 C to the middle of the century and 8 C to the end of the century. Moreover. all the South-American countries are experimenting a period of fast economic growth and people are continuously increasing their acquisitive power. Today. only a 15% of the built environment of Guayaquil uses air-conditioning to cool inside. but it is very probable that in the future there will be a significant increase in the use of active systems by the people in their homes and workplaces. This work explores the urban heat island effect on the city. The paper explores the spatial distribution of the city in order to parametrize the urban geometry and materials properties. then a set of simulations is done by using the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) tool.

Ecuador,2015,J Macias and G Soriano and H Sánchez and Y Canchingre,195,WIT Transaction on Ecology and The Environment,,307-315,,A study of the impact of solar reflectance of roofing assemblies on energy behaviour of social interest dwellings located in Guayaquil. Ecuador is presented. Values of solar reflectivity were obtained for a typical sample of local roofing materials using the procedure for measuring the solar reflectance of flat or curved roofing assemblies developed by Akabari. which is suitable for assemblies and surface materials with surface irregularities and non-homogeneous colour. This methodology when compared with the standard methodology ASTM E1918 “Standard Test Method for Measuring Solar Reflectance of Horizontal and Low-Sloped Surfaces in the Field” produces differences of±0.02 units of reflectance for sample assemblies of homogenous colour and±0.03 units in sample assemblies of heterogeneous colour. Values in the range of 0.29 to 0.51 were measured from the sample of local materials. The social interest dwelling model follows the guidelines of the Ecuadorian Secretary of Housing. The energy behaviour of the dwelling was modelled using a simulation software compliant with ANSI/ASHRAE 140. Differences of the annual energy consumption in KW-h of the dwelling when using a standard window air conditioning unit are analysed for the range of measured and ideal solar reflectance values.

We analyzed the energy consumption trends of 10 LEED-certified buildings and 14 non-LEED certified buildings at a major university in the US. Energy Use Intensity (EUI) of the LEED buildings was significantly higher (EUILEED = 331.20 kBtu/sf/yr) than non-LEED buildings (EUInon-LEED = 222.70 kBtu/sf/yr); however. the median EUI values were comparable (EUILEED = 172.64 and EUInon-LEED = 178.16). Because the distributions of EUI values were non-symmetrical in this dataset. both measures can be used for energy comparisons—this was also evident when EUI computations exclude outliers.

The problem manifests itself as the optimization of total costs of construction projects that consist of indirect project costs and individual activity costs. The trade-off occurs as project duration and. as a result. indirect project costs decrease with reduced individual activity duration. This reduction in individual activity duration is achieved by increasing resource allocation to individual activities. which increases their costs to completion. Historically. metaheuristic solutions have been applied to small-scale problems due to computational complexities and requirements of larger networks.

We conducted surveys with drivers in Brisbane. Australia. to understand potential factors that influence drivers' cruising behavior. This study reveals that errors in drivers' perception of parking cost are one of the leading factors encouraging drivers to cruise for on-street parking. Drivers are not necessarily well informed about parking costs. even when they claim to be familiar with these costs. The survey also reveals that the more informed drivers are about the local traffic and parking conditions. the less likely they are to cruise for extended periods of time. This finding demonstrates the value of traffic and parking information to effectively mitigate cruising for parking.

1207328,Wind speed perception and risk,2012,Duzgun Agdas and Gregory D Webster and Forrest J Masters,7,PLoS One,11,e49944,Public Library of Science,Background How accurately do people perceive extreme wind speeds and how does that perception affect the perceived risk? Prior research on human–wind interaction has focused on comfort levels in urban settings or knock-down thresholds. No systematic experimental research has attempted to assess people's ability to estimate extreme wind speeds and perceptions of their associated risks.   Method We exposed 76 people to 10. 20. 30. 40. 50. and 60 mph (4.5. 8.9. 13.4. 17.9. 22.3. and 26.8 m/s) winds in randomized orders and asked them to estimate wind speed and the corresponding risk they felt.   Results Multilevel modeling showed that people were accurate at lower wind speeds but overestimated wind speeds at higher levels. Wind speed perceptions mediated the direct relationship between actual wind speeds and perceptions of risk (i.e.. the greater the perceived wind speed. the greater the perceived risk). The number of tropical cyclones people had experienced moderated the strength of the actual–perceived wind speed relationship; consequently. mediation was stronger for people who had experienced fewer storms.

For a sustainable construction process. economically. environmentally. and socially friendly practices are essential. and reverse logistics is one solution that can provide such an approach. In reverse logistics. obsolete products are reused in a new production. while reducing negative effects to the environment. In this study. we assess the current state of research on reverse logistics practices in the construction industry. The study presents a comparative data mining analysis. followed by a content analysis. The results show that the construction industry literature ignores the impact of reverse logistics practices on upstream construction activities. We argue that industry practitioners must take reverse logistics decisions in the early phases of the construction process by considering both upstream and end-of-life construction activities. and we recommend a reverse logistics decision framework for successful reverse logistics implementation. The findings of this research are significant for decision-makers in the industry. We urge that sustainable practices be employed in the industry.

1207335,Forecasting completed cost of highway construction projects using LASSO regularized regression,2017,Yuanxin Zhang and R Edward Minchin Jr and Duzgun Agdas,143,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,10,04017071,American Society of Civil Engineers,Finishing highway projects within budget is critical for state highway agencies (SHAs) because budget overruns can result in severe damage to their reputation and credibility. Cost overruns in highway projects have plagued public agencies globally. Hence. this research aims to develop a parametric cost estimation model for SHAs to forecast the completed project cost prior to project execution to take necessary measures to prevent cost escalation. Ordinary least-square (OLS) regression has been a commonly used parametric estimation method in the literature. However. OLS regression has certain limitations. It. for instance. requires strict statistical assumptions. This paper proposes an alternative approach—least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)—that has proved in other fields of research to be significantly better than the OLS method in many respects. including automatic feature selection. the …,True,bVQPCkoAAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC,7,https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001378,14393990830514374185,/scholar?cites=14393990830514374185,,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/105940/1/Zhang%20et%20al.-Forecast_Highway_Cost_Using_LASSO.pdf,0,0,0

Prior research has focused on the characteristics of moving water that can reduce human stability or balance. The current research presents the first experiment on people's perceptions of risk and moving water at different speeds and depths.  Methods Using a randomized within-person 2 (water depth: 0.45. 0.90 m) ×3 (water speed: 0.4. 0.8. 1.2 m/s) experiment. we immersed 76 people in moving water and asked them to estimate water speed and the risk they felt.  Results Multilevel modeling showed that people increasingly overestimated water speeds as actual water speeds increased or as water depth increased. Water speed perceptions mediated the direct positive relationship between actual water speeds and perceptions of risk; the faster the moving water. the greater the perceived risk. Participants' prior experience with rip currents and tropical cyclones moderated the strength of the actual–perceived water speed relationship; consequently. mediation was stronger for people who had experienced no rip currents or fewer storms.  Conclusions These findings provide a clearer understanding of water speed and risk perception. which may help communicate the risks associated with anticipated floods and tropical cyclones.,True,bVQPCkoAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,6,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062477,17888504534142011810,/scholar?cites=17888504534142011810,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062477,0,0,0

Although the benefits of probabilistic simulation analyses over deterministic methods are well documented. the sMC simulation technique is quite sensitive to the probability distributions of the input variables. This phenomenon becomes highly pronounced when the region of interest within the joint probability distribution (a function of the input variables) is small. In such cases. the standard Monte Carlo approach is often impractical from a computational standpoint.

Construction Project-Based Small and Medium size Enterprises (PB-SMEs) are facing industry-driven push to uptake incremental and radical innovation emanates from technological advancement and escalating regulatory targets for energy efficiency. This poses construction PB-SMEs towards rapid adoption of not just incremental innovation for competent project delivery at present. also radical innovation for future competiveness such as competence to adopt smart construction systems. Research supports that the adoption of innovation is facilitated by effective knowledge sharing. As the one-off nature of project operation acts as a barrier to seamless transfer of knowledge across projects. so effectively sharing of innovation knowledge is challenging. Moreover. knowledge sharing is a social phenomenon. and willingness to share knowledge is impacted by the extent of sharer’s social embeddedness. The theory of social capital emphasises that actors’ embedment in network relationship can offer additional beneficial resources from network engagement. Although project operation is discontinuous in nature. it provides construction PB-SMEs the scopes to involve in various network engagements within the construction industry. These network engagements may lead to gradual establishment of social capital so as to offer additional resources to overcome disadvantages of project discontinuity.

Within this context. the Ecuadorian Antarctic seasonal Station Pedro Vicente Maldonado. built in 1990. will become. in a few yearsa permanent station. For this reason. to optimize energy consumption. various energy efficiency measures were analyzed on a calibrated energy model based on thecurrent base diesel consumption for heating. The results of this study show that the envelope elements. for which more energy is lost. are both floor and roof. Furthermore. due to the low window to wall ratio of the station. the reduction in diesel consumption generated by the use of triple and quadruple glazing is notsignificant. By combining different energy efficiency measures. up to 50% of savings on annual diesel consumption for heating can be achieved compared to thediesel consumption that the current station would present operating permanently.

1207360,Performance Analysis of Absorption Cooling Systems Using Linear Fresnel Solar Collectors,2011,Andrés Montero and Tobias Hirsch and Heiko Schenk and Joan Carles Bruno and Alberto Coronas,,,,,Umberto Desideri. Jinyue Yan,Thermally driven chillers using solar energy are a good alternative to conventional electricity driven chillers to meet the growing air-conditioning demand and to cut electrical peak loads during the summer. Also. their use allows to save primary energy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the electricity generation from fossil fuels. The most common solar air conditioning configuration on the market consists of a single-effect absorption chiller connected to flat plate or evacuated tube collectors. However. the low efficiency of this configuration is one of the barriers that the solar cooling technology has to address to be a real alternative to conventional systems. In order to improve the global COP of a solar cooling plant. the use of high-efficiency double-effect absorption chillers with appropriate back-up systems using medium temperature compact parabolic troughs (PTC) or linear Fresnel collectors (LFC) could be a more suitable solution for some applications. Due to their structural characteristics LFC can be located mainly on top of buildings. factories or parking lots. avoiding an extra use of space in comparison with PTC collectors.The objective of this paper is to analyse the performance of the LFC/Double-effect absorption chiller configuration. This analysis will evaluate the use of pressurised hot water to drive the double-effect absorption chiller (DE-AC) during a cooling season in an hourly basis for different solar field sizes and in two geographical locations.

Coronas,,,,,,The consumption of electricity in buildings for air conditioning can be reduced by using solar collectors and thermally driven chillers. If these systems could be modified to simultaneously produce power and cooling. the final effect could mean substantial savings at the electric bill. Solar cooling systems are characterised by high investment costs for the solar collector field and the chiller itself that is not always compensated by a high number of running hours per year. In this paper two configurations for cooling and power systems driven by thermal energy are presented and analysed.

The performance of the adaptive model included in CEN Standard EN15251 and the traditional PMV model are compared with reports of thermal environment satisfaction surveys presented simultaneously to all occupants of the office to determine which of the two comfort models is most suitable to evaluate the thermal environment. The results indicate that office occupants have developed some degree of adaptation to the climatic conditions of the city where the office is located (which only demands heating operation). and tend to accept and even prefer lower operative temperatures than those considered optimum by applying the PMV model. This is an indication that occupants of naturally conditioned buildings are usually able to match their comfort temperature to their normal environment. Therefore. the application of the adaptive model included in CEN Standard EN15251 seems like the optimal approach for evaluating thermal comfort in naturally conditioned buildings. because it takes into consideration the adaptive principle that indicates that if a change occurs such as to produce discomfort. people tend to react in ways which restore their comfort.

Recuperado de https://www. researchgate. net/publication/308255787_ Estimating_the_Urban_Heat_Island_Effect_in_the_City_of_Guayaquil,,,,Urban Heat Island effect (UHI) is a very important study aspect regarding the future of tropical cities. Guayaquil is the most populated city of Ecuador and leads on the river Guayas. close to the Pacific Ocean. in a very hot humid climatic emplacement. The climate of Guayaquil affects drastically the built environment. especially regarding the cooling demand of buildings and the related electricity consumption. In the future. cooling needs are expected to increase: predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the atmosphere temperature will rise up to 6 C to the end of the century in this region. so the temperatures are expected to increase in at least 4 C to the middle of the century and 8 C to the end of the century. Moreover. all the South-American countries are experimenting a period of fast economic growth and people are continuously increasing their acquisitive power. Today. only a 15% of the built environment of Guayaquil uses air-conditioning to cool inside. but it is very probable that in the future there will be a significant increase in the use of active systems by the people in their homes and workplaces. This work explores the urban heat island effect on the city. The paper explores the spatial distribution of the city in order to parametrize the urban geometry and materials properties. then a set of simulations is done by using the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) tool.

1207385,Thermal comfort performance within heritage buildings subject to a change of use,2014,R David Beltrán and Isabel Miño-Rodríguez and Andrea Lobato and Andrés Gallardo and Carlos Naranjo-Mendozac,,,,,,Rehabilitation of heritage buildings is an important process to preserve the historical heritage of a country. This process should not only consider the improvement of physical aspects but also energy savings focused on the operation stage without interfering with the thermal comfort of occupants. However. in most cases these parameters are neglected during the refurbishment process even though a change in the building occupancy pattern is planned. Within this context. this study was performed towards an analysis of the thermal behavior of heritage buildings in the Public University Yachay Tech (Ecuador) subject to a change of use (dwellings. scholar and offices) through building energy simulations. In addition. a thermal comfort analysis was conducted in order to evaluate whether the indoor conditions are adequate for the new occupancy pattern. The results demonstrate that the roofs and windows are the critical envelope elements with the highest heat losses at night and heat gains over the day. Moreover. the thermal comfort analysis showed that dwellings presented the best thermal performance. This fact implies that buildings have a better performance if they are used as their original conception. Further research will be performed to evaluate the application of passive and active strategies that fit within the restriction of preservation of heritage building but ensuring adequate thermal comfort for occupants.,True,2GVRn1QAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R_David_Beltran/publication/283490052_Thermal_comfort_performance_within_heritage_buildings_subject_to_a_change_of_use/links/563a44ac08ae337ef29841df/Thermal-comfort-performance-within-heritage-buildings-subject-to-a-change-of-use.pdf,17470000799862352392,/scholar?cites=17470000799862352392,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R_David_Beltran/publication/283490052_Thermal_comfort_performance_within_heritage_buildings_subject_to_a_change_of_use/links/563a44ac08ae337ef29841df/Thermal-comfort-performance-within-heritage-buildings-subject-to-a-change-of-use.pdf,0,0,0

However. what happens inside? This work deals with the effect that the interior thermal variables have on the propagation of respiratory diseases and focused on the relation of the temperature and relative humidity inside social housing in the 1040 parishes of Ecuador and the transmission of influenza. On the one hand. historical weather-related variables were used to simulate and estimate the interior conditions. and thresholds on temperature and humidity were determined. On the other hand. the health-related variable was determined by analyzing the statistics corresponding to the influenza and viral pneumonia in 2009 since that year was critical for these diseases; the data were divided by month for each parish. Finally. the correlation of these variables determines the relative importance of the interior conditions on the respiratory health of its inhabitants. The preliminary results indicate that the places with the lowest temperatures and relative humidity could favor the virus transmission. Also. the analysis indicated that respiratory diseases increase in August and October. In this way. it is clear that social housing projects in Ecuador require a study which guarantees not only energy efficiency and sustainability related issues but also the well-being of their inhabitants.,True,2GVRn1QAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,2,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/2019/6741202/,15660759986287681781,/scholar?cites=15660759986287681781,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/2019/6741202/,0,0,0

However. most of the mitigation policies recently developed (or under development) in South-America only considers heating demand reduction as a strategy to improve the building sector efficiency. This work uses IPCC data and the Urban Weather Generator tool to simulate the future performance of residential buildings in coastal locations of Chile. Peru and Ecuador. Three building typologies are tested: small family houses. medium size blocks of apartments and tall residential buildings. Future climate predictions of IPCC are inserted into hourly weather files to be used in building performance simulations by using Meteonorm (v. 7) and then the UWG tool is used to generate the urban environment. Finally. building performance simulation is conducted by using TRNSYS 17 tool for multizone buildings. Results confirm the hypothesis that in the future the cooling demand will be higher than the heating demand in analysed cities.

In this paper we add to the growing literature on public perceptions of risk and benefits related to fracking using data from Colorado. We find that trust in the oil and gas industry is powerful predictor of a range of risk and benefit perceptions while other ostensibly important variables—such as the extent of local drilling or the perceived economic significance of the oil and gas industry—have little role in risk and benefit perceptions. The effect of trust is robust across several different types of risk and benefits perceptions and survives the inclusion of an array of control variables.

We use data from an Internet archive to measure the population-adjusted rate of metal band foundings in 150 countries for the 1991–2008 period.

We include time-varying controls for gross national income. political regime. global economic integration. and degree of metal penetration of countries sharing a land or maritime border with each country. We find that digital capacity is positively associated with heavy metal band foundings. but. net of all controls. the effect is much stronger for countries with no history of metal music prior to 1990.

We examine how personal exposure to risk factors impacts risk perceptions and policy support related to air pollution and climate change. Our selection of risk exposure variables is informed by the “mental models” literature. and we employ an array of variables to capture subjective risk perceptions using novel survey data. We find that exposure to risk does little to predict risk perception and has a small influence on policy support.

However. studies investigating the combined influence of individual and country level economic indicators across several countries in the context of recent global recession are limited. This paper furthers our knowledge of the effect of recession on health at both the individual and national level.   Methods Using the Life in Transition II study. which provides data from 19.759 individuals across 26 European nations. we examine the relationship between self-rated health. personal economic experiences. and macro-economic change. Data analyses include. but are not limited to. the partial proportional odds model which permits the effect of predictors to vary across different levels of our dependent variable.   Results Household experiences with recession. especially a loss of staple good consumption. are associated with lower self-rated health. Most individual-level experiences with recession. such as a job loss. have relatively small negative effects on perceived health; the effect of individual or household economic hardship is strongest in high income nations. Our findings also suggest that macroeconomic growth improves self-rated health in low-income nations but has no effect in high-income nations.

1207424,The price of nuclear power: uranium communities and environmental justice,2015,Stephanie A Malin,,,,,Rutgers University Press,Rising fossil fuel prices and concerns about greenhouse gas emissions are fostering a nuclear power renaissance and a revitalized uranium mining industry across the American West. In The Price of Nuclear Power. environmental sociologist Stephanie Malin offers an on-the-ground portrait of several uranium communities caught between the harmful legacy of previous mining booms and the potential promise of new economic development. Using this context. she examines how shifting notions of environmental justice inspire divergent views about nuclear power’s sustainability and equally divisive forms of social activism. Drawing on extensive fieldwork conducted in rural isolated towns such as Monticello. Utah. and Nucla and Naturita. Colorado. as well as in upscale communities like Telluride. Colorado. and incorporating interviews with community leaders. environmental activists. radiation regulators. and mining executives. Malin uncovers a fundamental paradox of the nuclear renaissance: the communities most hurt by uranium’s legacy—such as high rates of cancers. respiratory ailments. and reproductive disorders—were actually quick to support industry renewal. She shows that many impoverished communities support mining not only because of the employment opportunities. but also out of a personal identification with uranium. a sense of patriotism. and new notions of environmentalism. But other communities. such as Telluride. have become sites of resistance. skeptical of industry and government promises of safe mining. fearing that regulatory enforcement won’t be strong enough.

In this paper. we add to the growing literature on unconventional oil and gas production (a.k.a.. “fracking”) and well-being by evaluating the association between self-reported stress induced by local oil and gas development and subjective well-being in the form of self-rated health. We also ask how the intensity of local drilling and trust in regulators influences self-rated health. Using novel survey data. we compare three Colorado communities with differential amounts of oil and gas development. Results from ordinal logistic regression models suggest that living in a community that hosts extraction is associated with lower self-rated health and that stress from local oil and gas operations is associated with lower self-rated health.

In this study we assess how the effect of economic development on consumption-based CIWB—a ratio of consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions to average life expectancy—changed from 1990 to 2008 for 69 nations throughout the world. We examine the effect of development on consumption-based CIWB for the overall sample as well as for smaller samples restricted to mostly high-income OECD nations. Non-OECD nations. and more nuanced regional samples of Non-OECD nations in Africa. Asia. and Latin America. We find that the effect of economic development on CIWB increased through time for the overall sample. However. analyses of the Non-OECD and OECD samples indicate that while the effect of development on CIWB increased from null to a moderate level for the Non-OECD nations. the effect of economic development was much larger. relatively stable through time. and more unsustainable for the OECD nations. Additional findings reveal important regional differences for Non-OECD nations. In the early 1990s. increased development led to a reduction in CIWB for Non-OECD nations in Africa. but in more recent years the relationship changed. becoming less sustainable.

That the world remains vastly unequal in the wake of such pressures foreshadows the challenges facing the development prospects of the poorer countries¥ and it is an indication of the links between power. disparate economic development and patterns of global environmental change.

The political economic theory of ecologically unequal exchange suggests that the global economy is characterized by an unequal flow of value to higher-income nations and the externalization of environmental degradation to lower-income nations. Neoinstitutional world polity theory suggests that connection to the global environmental regime may be associated with decreased levels of production of environmental harms and may mitigate negative environmental effects of integration in the global economic system. Results of panel analyses for a large sample of nations from 1965 to 2005 provide support for both theoretical orientations and suggest that the relations of ecologically unequal exchange may have an even greater effect on CO2 emissions in less developed countries than in others.

The findings support our hypothesis: the estimated effect of the three-way interaction on average life expectancy is negative and statistically significant. net of various socioeconomic and demographic …,True,tl26qfwAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,10,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6789/meta,16751152363538729681,/scholar?cites=16751152363538729681,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6789/pdf,0,0,0
1207464,Strengthening the ties between environmental sociology and sociology of development,2016,Jennifer Givens and Brett Clark and Andrew K Jorgenson,,The sociology of development handbook,,69-94,University of California Press,For decades. sociology of development scholars have considered the implications of economic development for environmental conditions as well as how natural resource availability and ecological regulatory mechanisms shape socio-development processes. At the same time. foundational perspectives within environmental sociology have examined the complex interrelationships between the natural conditions and development. paying particular attention to the effects of the latter in its various manifestations on ecological outcomes. Some of these foundational environmental sociology theories—at their core—are at loggerheads with one another in ways similar to classical debates concerning social change in development sociology between modernization and critical political-economic theories.In this chapter. we provide thorough overviews of contemporary theoretical perspectives within environmental sociology that address the impacts of development on natural conditions. We mainly discuss the environmental consequences of development. because this relationship is the subject of much of the theorization and empirical research in which social rather than natural forces are given causal primacy. These perspectives have much to offer to the broader sociology of development community and can further enrich empirical work. They also provide the means to bring environmental and development concerns even closer to the center of the field. 1 More broadly. scholars working at the intersections of environmental sociology and development sociology have much to contribute to multidisciplinary approaches to sustainability studies.,True,tl26qfwAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,8,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=QZPBDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA69&dq=info:-0E0Q1_h7kAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=qosom4XwG4&sig=DFNHJXDa1FdIJTwoJolwpLhTdDs,4678924862150164987,/scholar?cites=4678924862150164987,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Jorgenson2/publication/271020023_Strengthening_the_Ties_Between_Environmental_Sociology_and_the_Sociology_of_Development/links/54bc5b940cf29e0cb04be8c3/Strengthening-the-Ties-Between-Environmental-Sociology-and-the-Sociology-of-Development.pdf,0,0,0

Countries vary from one another dramatically in how effectively they convert resources into well-being. and some nations with low levels of emissions have relatively high objective and subjective well-being. We identify urgent research and policy agendas for four groups of countries with either low or high emissions and well-being indicators. Least studied are those with low well-being and high emissions. Understanding social and political barriers to switching from high-carbon to lower-carbon modes of production and consumption. and ways to overcome them. will be fundamental.,True,tl26qfwAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,7,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-sustainability/article/four-agendas-for-research-and-policy-on-emissions-mitigation-and-wellbeing/FF21DE61152F97ACA39B041E1E016CA7,5363639689549869988,/scholar?cites=5363639689549869988,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/FF21DE61152F97ACA39B041E1E016CA7/S2059479819000255a.pdf/four_agendas_for_research_and_policy_on_emissions_mitigation_and_wellbeing.pdf,0,0,0
1207466,Drivers of climate change beliefs,2014,Jennifer E Givens,4,Nature Climate Change,12,1051-1052,Nature Publishing Group,These findings have policy implications as political factors can influence whether or not people perceive actual warming. Importantly though. a majority of respondents do perceive winter warming. and this could translate into public support for adaptation policies. However. as attribution of winter warming to climate change is influenced by pre-existing beliefs and political orientation. this could affect the level of public support for mitigation policies. as accepting responsibility for mitigation requires acknowledging the human causes of climate change. This suggests that even experiencing the realities of climate change will not necessarily lead to acceptance that anthropogenic global warming is occurring. The sociological approach taken by McCright et al. 3 emphasizes the role of political orientation in shaping perceptions and beliefs about climate change and thus analyses the social construction of such perceptions …,True,tl26qfwAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,6,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2453,13920169413413723999,/scholar?cites=13920169413413723999,,,0,0,0

Prior research finds political-economic factors shape climate change views. perceptions of and policy support for renewable and nonrenewable energy. and pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs). This study contributes to research in these three areas by empirically testing the anti-reflexivity thesis. which posits that forces defending the industrial capitalist system are sources of anti-reflexivity. obstructing critical self-evaluation and societal action to address climate change. Using OLS and logistic regression analysis of survey data from respondents in five states in the US Intermountain West region. we find empirical support for the effect of anti-reflexivity on climate views. energy policy support. and PEBs.
