Depending on genetic background. some of the Igf·1(−/−) dwarfs die shortly after birth. while others survive and reach adulthood. In contrast. null mutants for the Igf1r gene die invariably at birth of respiratory fallure and exhibit a more severe growth deficiency (45% normal size).

10103597,Parental imprinting of the mouse insulin-like growth factor II gene,1991,Thomas M DeChiara and Elizabeth J Robertson and Argiris Efstratiadis,64,Cell,4,849-859,Cell Press,We are studying mice that carry a targeted disruption of the gene encoding insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). Transmission of this mutation through the male germline results in heterozygous progeny that are growth deficient. In contrast. when the disrupted gene is transmitted maternally. the heterozygous offspring are phenotypically normal. Therefore. the difference in growth phenotypes depends on the type of gamete contributing the mutated allele. Homozygous mutants are indistinguishable in appearance from growth-deficient heterozygous siblings. Nuclease protection and in situ hybridization analyses of the transcripts from the wild-type and mutated alleles indicated that only the paternal allele is expressed in embryos. while the maternal allele is silent.

Imprinting of the insulin-2 and insulin-like growth factor 2 genes. which lie about 100 kilobases upstream of H19. can be disrupted by maternal inheritance of a targeted deletion of the H19 gene and its flanking sequence.

The gene contains two introns: a 3.5 kb intron interrupting the region encoding the connecting peptide and a 119 bp intron interrupting the DNA corresponding to the 5′ noncoding region of the mRNA.

Since the rat insulin gene I lacks a 499 bp intron in the coding region. the rat genes have evolved by a recent gene duplication followed by loss of this intron in one copy.

A wide range of mutation rates has been reported. but at a limited number of genomic target sites. To uncover the rules that govern effective Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in zebrafish. we targeted over a hundred genomic loci for mutagenesis using a streamlined and cloning-free method. We generated mutations in 85% of target genes with mutation rates varying across several orders of magnitude. and identified sequence composition rules that influence mutagenesis. We increased rates of mutagenesis by implementing several novel approaches. The activities of poor or unsuccessful single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) initiating with a 5′ adenine were improved by rescuing 5′ end homogeneity of the sgRNA. In some cases. direct injection of Cas9 protein/sgRNA complex further increased mutagenic activity. We also observed that low diversity of mutant alleles led to repeated failure to obtain frame-shift mutations. This limitation was overcome by knock-in of a stop codon cassette that ensured coding frame truncation.

The cardiovascular system is particularly amenable for screening in the transparent zebrafish embryo because the heart and blood vessels are prominent and their function easily examined. We have classified the mutations affecting the heart into those that affect primarily either morphogenesis or function. Nine mutations clearly disrupt the formation of the heart. cloche deletes the endocardium. In cloche mutants. the myocardial layer forms in the absence of the endocardium but is dysmorphic and exhibits a weak contractility. Two loci. miles apart and bonnie and clyde. play a critical role in the fusion of the bilateral tubular primordia.

The graded activity of morphogens within tissues exposes cells to different signal levels and leads to region-specific transcriptional responses and cell fates. In its simplest incarnation. a morphogen signal forms a gradient by diffusion from a local source and clearance in surrounding tissues. Responding cells often transduce morphogen levels in a linear fashion. which results in the graded activation of transcriptional effectors. The concentration-dependent expression of morphogen target genes is achieved by their different binding affinities for transcriptional effectors as well as inputs from other transcriptional regulators.

Using this platform and immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) as a readout of neural activity. we have developed a system to create and contextualize whole-brain maps of stimulus-and behavior-dependent neural activity. This mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP)-mapping assay is technically simple. and data analysis is completely automated.

Mutants were analyzed for abnormalities in the cartilaginous head skeleton. Further. the expression of marker genes was studied to investigate potential abnormalities in mutant rhombencephalon. neural crest. and pharyngeal endoderm. The results suggest that the identified mutations affect three distinct aspects of craniofacial development. In one group. mutations affect the overall pattern of the craniofacial skeleton. suggesting that the genes are involved in the specification of these elements.

Because of its importance for Treg cells. we examined the role of IL-2 in Th17 generation and demonstrate that a previously unrecognized aspect of IL-2 function is to constrain IL-17 production. Genetic deletion or antibody blockade of IL-2 promoted differentiation of the Th17 cell subset. Whereas STAT3 appeared to be a key positive regulator of RORγt and IL-17 expression. absence of IL-2 or disruption of its signaling by deletion of the transcription factor STAT5 resulted in enhanced Th17 cell development.

Locally. milk accumulates within alveolar lumens; systemically. levels of lactogenic hormones fall. Four experimental models were used to define the role of local factors as compared with systemic hormones during the first and second stages of involution. In three models. milk release was disrupted in the presence of systemic lactogenic hormones: (i) sealing of the teats. (ii) mammary gland transplants that cannot release milk due to the absence of a teat connection. and (iii) inactivation of the oxytocin gene. The ability of systemic hormones to preserve lobular-alveolar structure without blocking PCD was illustrated using a fourth transgenic model of lactation failure.

It was introduced 200 million years ago with the appearance of mammals to provide nourishment to the newborn in the form of milk. The mammary gland is characterized by a unique dependence on hormonal signals for terminal differentiation. which is attained only after pregnancy. At the time of birth. the anlage consists of a few rudimentary ducts in the vicinity of the nipple. Pronounced ductal outgrowth and branching commences at puberty. and in pregnancy an expanded lobulo-alveolar compartment develops. Functional differentiation of the secretory epithelium coincides with parturition and large amounts of milk are produced and secreted during lactation.

The hyperplasia was reversed when TAg expression was silenced for 3 weeks. When TAg expression was silenced after 7 months. however. the hyperplasia persisted even though TAg was absent. Although the polyploidy of ductal cells could be reversed at 4 months of age. cells at 7 months of age remained polyploid even in the absence of TAg.

A major consequence of these mutations is the production of a shortened 2.4-kb tumorspecific Int3 RNA transcript that encodes the entire intracellular domain of the Int3 protein. Previous studies have demonstrated that mammary gland development and function was severely impaired in transgenic mice expressing the truncated Int3 gene product from the MMTV viral promoter. Both mammary ductal growth and secretory lobule development were curtailed in these mice.

Because of the concerted stretching of the pulse sequence. this expt. is referred to as accordion spectroscopy. The salient feature of the novel expt. is the accommodation of 2-dimensional information along a single time or frequency axis. In complete analogy to std. 2-dimensional exchange spectroscopy. the peak positions in an accordion spectrum characterize the origin (w1) and destination (w2) of the exchanging magnetization. The 3rd dimension (wm) is reflected in the lineshape along the w1. wm axis. These lineshapes correspond to Fourier transforms with respect to tm of the mixing functions aii (tm) and aij (tm). and contain all information relevant to the dynamic processes.

Ltd,The anti‐apoptotic proteins Bcl‐2 and Bcl‐XL bind and inhibit Beclin‐1. an essential mediator of autophagy. Here. we demonstrate that this interaction involves a BH3 domain within Beclin‐1 (residues 114–123). The physical interaction between Beclin‐1 and Bcl‐XL is lost when the BH3 domain of Beclin‐1 or the BH3 receptor domain of Bcl‐XL is mutated. Mutation of the BH3 domain of Beclin‐1 or of the BH3 receptor domain of Bcl‐XL abolishes the Bcl‐XL‐mediated inhibition of autophagy triggered by Beclin‐1.

Ltd,Cells suffer necrotic death when exposed to extreme environmental conditions. adverse and excessive stimuli. or when deleterious mutations are encoded in their genetic material. Unlike apoptosis. which involves a highly regulated and elaborate network of biochemical events and cascades. necrosis has been considered generally to be a chaotic decadence process that effects the inexorable demise of cells otherwise not destined to die. This grim prospect is now slowly being overturned. mostly by exciting new findings in two simple model organisms. Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster.

MA, The stability of the proteome is crucial to the health of the cell. and contributes significantly to the lifespan of the organism. Aging and many age-related diseases have in common the expression of misfolded and damaged proteins. The chronic expression of damaged proteins during disease can have devastating consequences on protein homeostasis (proteostasis). resulting in disruption of numerous biological processes. This chapter discusses our current understanding of the various contributors to protein misfolding. and the mechanisms by which misfolding. and accompanied aggregation/toxicity. is accelerated by stress and aging. Invertebrate models have been instrumental in studying the processes related to aggregation and toxicity of disease-associated proteins and how dysregulation of proteostasis leads to neurodegenerative diseases of aging.,True,afQKKl8AAAAJ:W2uZP3ddy8sC,158,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-7002-2_11,13438192988244876855,/scholar?cites=13438192988244876855,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3402352/,0,0,0

Such a definition. however. proved to be inapplicable to many necrotic scenarios. The discovery that genetic manipulation of several proteins either protected or enhanced necrotic cell death argued in favor of a regulated and hence programmed process. as it is the case for apoptosis.

It is important to maintain a healthy mitochondrial population which is tightly regulated by proteolysis and mitophagy. Mitophagy is a specialized form of autophagy that regulates the turnover of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria. organelles that function in producing energy for the cell in the form of ATP and regulating energy homeostasis. Mechanistic studies on mitophagy across species highlight a sophisticated and integrated cellular network that regulates the degradation of mitochondria.

Preconditioning of animals at a mildly elevated temperature strongly protects from heat-induced necrosis. The heat-shock transcription factor HSF-1 and the small heat-shock protein HSP-16.1 mediate cytoprotection by preconditioning. HSP-16.1 localizes to the Golgi. where it functions with the Ca 2+-and Mn 2+-transporting ATPase PMR-1 to maintain Ca 2+ homeostasis under heat stroke.

About 6.000 sequences (ORFans) from the literature that heretofore lacked similarity to known proteins have matches in the GOS data. The GOS dataset is also used to improve remote homology detection. Overall. besides nearly doubling the number of current proteins. the predicted GOS proteins also add a great deal of diversity to known protein families and shed light on their evolution. These observations are illustrated using several protein families. including phosphatases. proteases. ultraviolet-irradiation DNA damage repair enzymes. glutamine synthetase. and RuBisCO.

The relatively small genome of the elephant shark. Callorhinchus milii. a chimaera. makes it an attractive model cartilaginous fish genome for whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis. Here. the authors describe survey sequencing (1.4× coverage) and comparative analysis of the elephant shark genome. one of the first cartilaginous fish genomes to be sequenced to this depth. Repetitive sequences. represented mainly by a novel family of short interspersed element–like and long interspersed element–like sequences. account for about 28% of the elephant shark genome. Fragments of approximately 15.000 elephant shark genes reveal specific examples of genes that have been lost differentially during the evolution of tetrapod and teleost fish lineages. Interestingly. the degree of conserved synteny and conserved sequences between the human and elephant shark genomes are higher than that between human and teleost fish genomes. Elephant shark contains putative four Hox clusters indicating that. unlike teleost fish genomes. the elephant shark genome has not experienced an additional whole-genome duplication. These findings underscore the importance of the elephant shark as a critical reference vertebrate genome for comparative analysis of the human and other vertebrate genomes.

We focus here on the variants in a person's ‘exome.’ which is the set of exons in a genome. because the exome is believed to harbor much of the functional variation. We provide an analysis of the ∼12.500 variants that affect the protein coding portion of an individual's genome. We identified ∼10.400 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in this individual. of which ∼15–20% are rare in the human population. We predict ∼1.500 nsSNPs affect protein function and these tend be heterozygous. rare. or novel. Of the ∼700 coding indels. approximately half tend to have lengths that are a multiple of three. which causes insertions/deletions of amino acids in the corresponding protein. rather than introducing frameshifts. Coding indels also occur frequently at the termini of genes. so even if an indel causes a frameshift. an alternative start or stop site in the gene can still be used to make a functional protein. In summary. we reduced the set of ∼12.500 nonsilent coding variants by ∼8-fold to a set of variants that are most likely to have major effects on their proteins' functions. This is our first glimpse of an individual's exome and a snapshot of the current state of personalized genomics. The majority of coding variants in this individual are common and appear to be functionally neutral.

It is now evident that cancer is not one disease but many. It has also become clear in the past several decades. that any particular cancer arises as the result of the gradual accumulation of many different types of genetic changes in a single cell. Whereas no single genetic change may be sufficient. the number of accumulated changes required to alter the behaviour of a normal cell to a cancer cell is still not clear. Changes in only a subset of the approximately 100.000 human genes contribute to cancer and the search for these'cancer genes' defines the central challenge in cancer biology. It is the specific collection of genetic changes and the pattern of altered gene product expression and function that provides the actual definition of any cancer in the context of. but not strictly dependent upon. its site of origin.

UNIV OF WROCLAW,During the last decade microsatellites or SSRs (simple sequence repeats) have been proven to be the markers of choice in plant genetics research and for breeding purposes because of their hypervariability and ease of detection. However. development of these markers is expensive. labour intensive and time consuming. in particular. if they are being developed from genomic libraries. In the context of large-scale sequencing and genomics programmes in various cereal species at different laboratories. a large set of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is being generated. which can be used to search for microsatellites. Keeping in view the importance of such type of SSRs. available ESTs of some cereal species like barley. maize. oats. rice. rye and wheat were investigated for a study of abundance. frequency and distribution of various types of microsatellites. SSRs were present in about 7% to 10% of the total ESTs in the investigated cereal genomes. On the basis of surveying EST sequences amounting to 75.2 Mb in barley. 54.7 Mb in maize. 43.9 Mb in rice. 3.7 Mb in rye. 41.6 Mb in sorghum and 37.5 Mb in wheat. the frequency of SSRs was 1/7.5 kb in barley. 1/7.5 kb in maize. 1/6.2 kb in wheat. 1/5.5 kb in rye and sorghum and 1/3.9 kb in rice. The overall average SSR frequency for these species is 1/6.0 kb. Trimeric repeats are the most abundant (54% to 78%) class of microsatellites followed by dimeric repeats (17% to 40%). Among the trimeric repeats the motifs CCG are the most common in all the cases ranging from 32% in wheat to 49% in sorghum.

Due to its origin through a single and recent polyploidization event. followed by successive selection during breeding efforts. cultivated groundnut has a limited genetic background. In such species. microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are very informative and useful for breeding applications. The low level of polymorphism in cultivated germplasm. however. warrants a need of larger number of polymorphic microsatellite markers for cultivated groundnut. A microsatellite-enriched library was constructed from the genotype TMV2. Sequencing of 720 putative SSR-positive clones from a total of 3.072 provided 490 SSRs. 71.2% of these SSRs were perfect type. 13.1% were imperfect and 15.7% were compound. Among these SSRs. the GT/CA repeat motifs were the most common (37.6%) followed by GA/CT repeat motifs (25.9%). The primer pairs could be designed for a total of 170 SSRs and were optimized initially on two genotypes. 104 (61.2%) primer pairs yielded scorable amplicon and 46 (44.2%) primers showed polymorphism among 32 cultivated groundnut genotypes.

Day length is perceived in leaves and induces a systemic signal. called florigen. that moves through the phloem to the shoot apex. At the shoot apical meristem (SAM). florigen causes changes in gene expression that reprogram the SAM to form flowers instead of leaves. Analysis of flowering of Arabidopsis thaliana placed the CONSTANS/FLOWERING LOCUS T (CO/FT) module at the core of a pathway that promotes flowering in response to changes in day length.

Photoperiod is detected in the vascular tissue of the leaf (phloem) and promotes production of a systemic signal that induces flowering at the meristem. Vernalization. the response to winter temperatures. overcomes a block on photoperiodic floral induction. In Arabidopsis. this block is caused by inhibitors of flowering that comprise several related MADS-box transcription factors. the most prominent of which is FLC. We show that FLC delays flowering by repressing production in the leaf of at least two systemic signals. one of which is controlled by the RAF kinase inhibitor-like protein FT.

Analysis of seven classical co mutant alleles demonstrated that the mutations all occur within either the zinc finger region or the CCT domain. confirming that the two regions of homology are important for CO function.

To understand the complex interplay between activating and repressive inputs controlling flowering through FT. cis-regulatory sequences of FT were identified in this study. A proximal and an ∼5-kb upstream promoter region containing highly conserved sequence blocks were found to be essential for FT activation by CONSTANS (CO). Chromatin-associated protein complexes add another layer to FT regulation. In plants constitutively overexpressing CO. changes in chromatin status. such as a decrease in binding of LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1) and increased acetylation of H3K9 and K14. were observed throughout the FT locus. although these changes appear to be a consequence of FT upregulation and not a prerequisite for …,True,14K2mxoAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,261,http://www.plantcell.org/content/22/5/1425.short,14888334836657195161,/scholar?cites=14888334836657195161,,http://www.plantcell.org/content/plantcell/22/5/1425.full.pdf,0,0,0
10104094,The quest for florigen: a review of recent progress,2006,Laurent Corbesier and George Coupland,57,,13,3395-3403,Oxford University Press,The photoperiodic induction of flowering is a systemic process requiring translocation of a floral stimulus from the leaves to the shoot apical meristem. In response to this stimulus. the apical meristem stops producing leaves to initiate floral development; this switch in morphogenesis involves a change in the identity of the primordia initiated and in phyllotaxis. The physiological study of the floral transition has led to the identification of several putative floral signals such as sucrose. cytokinins. gibberellins. and reduced N-compounds that are translocated in the phloem sap from leaves to the shoot apical meristem. On the other hand. the genetic approach developed more recently in Arabidopsis thaliana allowed the discovery of many genes that control flowering time.

10104104,Time measurement and the control of flowering in plants,2000,Alon Samach and George Coupland,22,,1,38-47,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,Many plants are adapted to flower at particular times of year. to ensure optimal pollination and seed maturation. In these plants flowering is controlled by environmental signals that reflect the changing seasons. particularly daylength and temperature. The response to daylength varies. so that plants isolated at higher latitudes tend to flower in response to long daylengths of spring and summer. while plants from lower latitudes avoid the extreme heat of summer by responding to short days. Such responses require a mechanism for measuring time. and the circadian clock that regulates daily rhythms in behaviour also acts as the timer in the measurement of daylength. Plants from high latitudes often also show an extreme response to temperature called vernalisation in which flowering is repressed until the plant is exposed to winter temperatures for an extended time.

We have compared the kinetics of secretion from these different compartments during host cell invasion using immunofluorescence. immunoelectron microscopy. and quantitative immunoassays. Binding to the host cell triggered apical release of the micronemal protein MIC2 at the tight attachment zone that forms between the parasite and the host cell. In a second step. invagination of the host cell plasma membrane was initiated by discharge of the rhoptry protein ROP1 to form a nascent parasitophorous vacuole (PV). ROP1 was fully discharged into the vacuole by the time invasion was complete. In contrast to these very rapid early events. release of the dense granule markers GRA1 and NTPase was delayed until after the parasite was fully within the PV. eventually peaking at 20 min post-invasion.

Efficient cell entry. ability to exploit intracellular niches. and persistence make these parasites treacherous pathogens. Most intracellular parasites gain entry via host-mediated processes. but apicomplexans use a system of adhesion-based motility called “gliding” to actively penetrate host cells.

However. the majority of infections are asymptomatic. possibly because the organism has co-evolved with its many vertebrate hosts and has developed multiple strategies to persist asymptomatically for the lifetime of the host. Over the past two decades. infection studies in the mouse. combined with forward-genetics approaches aimed at unravelling the molecular basis of infection. have revealed that T. gondii virulence is mediated. in part. by secretion of effector proteins into the host cell during invasion.

Comparison with ancient strains (∼1 million years) suggests that the success of the clonal lineages resulted from the concurrent acquisition of direct oral infectivity.

Here we demonstrate that the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii disarms macrophage innate clearance mechanisms by secreting a serine threonine kinase called ROP18. which binds to and phosphorylates immunity-related GTPases (IRGs). Substrate profiling of ROP18 revealed a preference for a conserved motif within switch region I of the GTPase domain. a modification predicted to disrupt IRG function. Consistent with this. expression of ROP18 was both necessary and sufficient to block recruitment of Irgb6. which was in turn required for parasite destruction.

Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe the global cell cycle transcriptome of the tachyzoite stage of Toxoplasma gondii. In dividing tachyzoites. more than a third of the mRNAs exhibit significant cyclical profiles whose timing correlates with biosynthetic events that unfold during daughter parasite formation. These 2.833 mRNAs have a bimodal organization with peak expression occurring in one of two transcriptional waves that are bounded by the transition into S phase and cell cycle exit following cytokinesis. The G1-subtranscriptome is enriched for genes required for basal biosynthetic and metabolic functions. similar to most eukaryotes. while the S/M-subtranscriptome is characterized by the uniquely apicomplexan requirements of parasite maturation. development of specialized organelles. and egress of infectious daughter cells. Two dozen AP2 transcription factors form a series through the tachyzoite cycle with successive sharp peaks of protein expression in the same timeframes as their mRNA patterns. indicating that the mechanisms responsible for the timing of protein delivery might be mediated by AP2 domains with different promoter recognition specificities.

OTF-1. which stimulates transcription of a human histone H2b gene. has been purified from HeLa nuclear extracts. This purification was achieved through the use of DNA affinity chromatography. and the factor was unambiguously identified by renaturation of activity following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified factor retained the ability to efficiently stimulate H2b transcription in a reconstituted in vitro system. This effect was dependent upon an intact octamer element and was observed in the absence of the other H2b promoter elements (except the TATA motif). Furthermore. this activity was not detected in nuclear extracts prepared from cells synchronized in G2. in agreement with the in vivo data showing S-phase-specific utilization of the octamer element.

These analyses showed that during the S phase there was a 15-fold increase in the levels of histone mRNAs and that this resulted from both an increased rate of synthesis and a lengthening of the half-life of histone mRNAs. A comparison of the kinetics of accumulation of histone mRNA in the total cellular and nuclear RNA populations suggested an increased transcription rate through the S phase. Within 30 min after the inhibition of DNA synthesis in mid-S phase. the steady-state concentration and the rate of synthesis of histone mRNA each declined to their non-S-phase levels. Reactivation of histone mRNA accumulation could occur even after an extended mid-S-phase block in DNA synthesis.

10104193,Cell death and the cell cycle: a relationship between transformation and neurodegeneration?,1993,Nathaniel Heintz,18,,5,157-159,Elsevier Current Trends,A final interesting question is the ribosomal environment of the nascent peptide: in brief. is it a groove or a tunnel? Low-resolution crystallographic studies on the ribosome have suggested a tunnel in the 50S subunit. A. Johnson (University of Oklahoma) reported evidence of a different kind that also supports the notion of a tunnel. Using fluorescently labelled derivatives of lysine incorporated into aminoacyltRNA. and thence into preprolactin. coupled with an endoplasmic reticulum docking system. he has measured two relevant parameters. First. fluorescence lifetime distinguishe~ whether the nascent peptide is in an aqueous or nonpolar environment. Second. quenching by iodide distinguishes whether the nascent peptide is accessible to solvent.The experiments showed that the nascent peptide is in an aqueous environment both in free ribosomes and after docking to the membrane.

Macroscopic recordings quantify the enhancement of desensitization onset by lynx1 and further show that it slows recovery from desensitization and increases the EC50.

Intrinsic viscosity. hydrodynamic radii. and small-angle x-ray scattering studies. in contrast. indicate that the dimensions of most chemically denatured proteins scale with polypeptide length by means of the power-law relationship expected for random-coil behavior. Here we further explore this discrepancy by expanding the length range of characterized denatured-state radii of gyration (RG) and by reexamining proteins that reportedly do not fit the expected dimensional scaling. We find that only 2 of 28 crosslink-free. prosthetic-group-free. chemically denatured polypeptides deviate significantly from a power-law relationship with polymer length. The RG of the remaining 26 polypeptides. which range from 16 to 549 residues. are well fitted (r2 = 0.988) by a power-law …,True,Q_-5uPsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,670,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/34/12491.short,16110776765984010862,/scholar?cites=16110776765984010862,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/101/34/12491.full.pdf,0,0,0
10104216,Theory of extended x-ray absorption edge fine structure (EXAFS) in crystalline solids,1975,CA Ashley and S Doniach,11,Physical Review B,4,1279,American Physical Society,A general theory of the extended x-ray absorption edge fine structure is given within the framework of a one-electron approximation. An approximate evaluation of this theory is proposed which allows a simple calculation of the spectrum starting from theoretically calculated electron-atom scattering phase shifts. This is shown to agree quite well with the observed spectrum for copper in the energy range 200-800 eV above the K edge without the use of any adjustable parameters. A qualitative evaluation of multiple scattering effects in the general theory is made which should be reasonably good below 100 eV. Multiple scattering corrections are found to be very important in the low-energy region of the spectrum for close-packed structures. It is shown that significant cancellation of single scattering amplitudes can occur which could account for detailed anomalies in the spectrum of Cu found by Stern.

At low temperatures the resulting quantum x-y model shows a second-order phase transition between a superconducting state and an insulating state as a function of the ratio of the phase stiffness to the Coulomb energy measured on the scale of the mean pair spacing. By relating the functional formulation to a BCS-type model of high-temperature superconductivity in the strongly correlated regime. we show that the phase stiffness is proportional to doping away from the 1/2-full Mott insulating state. We discuss application of the model as a mechanism for the onset of superconductivity of the CuO 2-based high-T c materials above a critical doping level.

The prokaryotic chaperonin GroEL requires a cofactor. GroES. which serves as a “lid” enclosing substrates in the central cavity and confers an asymmetry on GroEL required for cooperative transitions driving the reaction. The eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT does not have such a cofactor but appears to have a “built-in” lid. Whether this seemingly symmetric chaperonin also operates through an asymmetric cycle is unclear. We show that unlike GroEL. TRiC does not close its lid upon nucleotide binding. but instead responds to the trigonal-bipyramidal transition state of ATP hydrolysis. Further. nucleotide analogs inducing this transition state confer an asymmetric conformation on TRiC. Similar to GroEL. lid closure in TRiC confines the substrates in the cavity and is essential for folding.

As urea and GuHCl dominate spectroscopic studies of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics. these denaturants have similarly been employed in the vast majority of small-angle scattering studies as well.

Polynomial texture mapping (PTM). a new technique for imaging surface relief using an ordinary digital camera and multiple light sources. offers an opportunity to resolve these difficulties. In PTM. a series of 50 pictures is taken with the specimen and camera in fixed positions. but with varying directions of incoming light. These pictures are converted digitally into a PTM file. incorporating information about the reflectance of each pixel under different lighting conditions. The number. position. and intensity of virtual light sources can then be manipulated. as can the reflectance properties of the imaged surface. In addition to bringing out low surface relief that may otherwise be difficult to illustrate. PTM also allows electronic transfer. storage. and publication of images. allowing users to manipulate virtual light sources interactively. Herein we test this technique using fossils with different types of preservation. including Cambrian fossils from the Burgess Shale and Chengjiang conservation lagerstätten.

Cambrian trace fossils in sandstone from Sweden. and Neoproterozoic impression fossils from the Ediacara lagerstätten of south Australia. Whereas not optimal for all types of fossil preservation.

This upwelling is an effect of deflected regional currents. not of expulsion of fluids or gas from the seafloor. and is sufficiently strong to prevent the settling of fine particles. The field measurements. although noisy at low vertical velocities. are consistent with the hypothesis of upwelling.

Norway,2009,Karen E Webb and Øyvind Hammer and Aivo Lepland and John S Gray,29,Geo-Marine Letters,2,111-124,Springer-Verlag,Multibeam bathymetric surveys of the Inner Oslofjord. Norway have revealed a high density of pockmarks in the 179-km2 inner fjord area. which contains over 500 pockmarks of varying size. typically 20–50 m in diameter and 2–10 m deep. These pockmarks have been investigated with a variety of techniques. including acoustic subbottom profiling. sedimentological and geochemical analyses of cores. remotely operated vehicle observation. and morphometry. Both the distribution and shapes of the pockmarks suggest that they are related to structures in the bedrock underlying relatively thin (<50 m) unconsolidated glacial and postglacial sediments. The data provide no direct indication of a particular mode of pockmark formation. but release of large amounts of biogenic. shallow methane seems unlikely.

The depositional environment was fully marine. Based on foraminiferal and ammonite biostratigraphy (Nagy & Basov 1998; Wierzbowski et al. 2011) the member corresponds approximately to the Volgian and Ryazanian Stages. highly condensed in the upper part and with a probable hiatus in the Upper Volgian. The Slottsmøya Member therefore spans the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary. and may contain evidence for the Mjølnir meteorite impact event close to the Volgian-Ryazanian boundary in the Barents Sea (Dypvik et al. 1996). The member is also notable because of its fossil-rich methane seep carbonates (Hammer et al. 2011) and the extremely abundant remains of marine reptiles (Hurum et al.. this volume).Our current work on the paleontology and hydrocarbon migration history of the Slottsmøya Member (Hurum et al.. this volume) requires high stratigraphic resolution. The variable lithology and thickness of this member. combined with overthrusts and slumping (Dypvik et al. 1991a). complicate the use of lithostratigraphic markers.

The model output is compared with experimental results obtained using an oversaturated calcite solution produced by mixing CaCl2 and Na2CO3. The precipitation rate is observed to increase when the supersaturated solution flows over an obstruction. leading to a growth instability that causes the formation of terraces. At relatively high flow rates. the most important mechanism for this behaviour seems to be hydrodynamic advection of dissolved species either towards or away from the calcite surface. depending on location relative to the obstruction. which deforms the concentration gradients.

The simplest explanation may be that such ribs forma s a result of soscillation in a regulartory system involving purely mechanical factors.  A mathematical model is presnted. showing how a simple reghulative system can produce reibs.

Their complex morphologies. caused by iterated invaginations of the posterior body wall. can be explained using a mechano‐chemical model inspired by modem developmental models for epithelial folding in kidneys. lungs. teeth. mammary glands and other organs. A morphogen. organized to form a regular spacing pattern by reaction‐diffusion dynamics or similar processes. induces changes in cell shape and/or rate of proliferation. causing invagination and the formation of lobes. Interactions between mechanical and chemical effects. combined with expanding size due to overall growth. produce a “fractal”; pattern of smaller (secondary) invaginations superimposed on larger (primary) ones.

The hydrostatic properties of the Triassic oxyconic ammonite Intornites nevadanus were estimated from measured coiling parameters. body chamber length and digitized whorl section. The calculations indicate close to neutral buoyancy. The orientation of the aperture is 33 degrees from the horizontal. and the stability index relatively high at 0.054. Unlike for many other ammonites. these values are comparable to those of Nautilus. suggesting a similar nektobenthic lifestyle. An apertural interior shell callus does not contribute to stability in this genus. and its function remains unknown. In Amaltheus margaritatus. hydrostatic properties and body chamber length vary significantly as a result of intraspecific variation in shell shape.

In these tumors. ERα repression is often due to epigenetic modifications such as methylation and histone deacetylation. For this reason. we investigated the ability of the histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat (ENT) to trigger reexpression of ERα and aromatase in breast cancer cells. with the notion that this treatment would restore sensitivity to the aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole. ENT treatment of tumor cells increased expression of ERα and aromatase. along with the enzymatic activity of aromatase. in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. Notably. ERα and aromatase upregulation resulted in sensitization of breast cancer cells to estrogen and letrozole.

We investigated the mechanism by which UV irradiation induces the c-jun gene. The earliest detectable step was activation of Src tyrosine kinases. followed by activation of Ha-Ras and Raf-1. The response to UV was blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors and dominant negative mutants of v-src. Ha-ras. and raf-1. This signaling cascade leads to increased phosphorylation of c-Jun on two serine residues that potentiate its activity. These results strongly suggest that the UV response is initiated at or near the plasma membrane rather than the nucleus.

Because several previously identified UV-inducible genes contain AP-1 binding sites within their promoters. we investigated the induction of AP-1 activity by DNA-damaging agents. We found that expression of both c-jun and c-fos. which encode proteins that participate in formation of the AP-1 complex. is rapidly induced by two different DNA-damaging agents: UV and H2O2. Interestingly. the c-jun gene is far more responsive to UV than any other immediate-early gene that was examined. including c-fos. Other jun and fos genes were only marginally affected by UV or H2O2. Furthermore. UV is a much more efficient inducer of c-jun than phorbol esters. the standard inducers of c-jun expression.

Mitochondria rapidly lose their transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). both of which are likely to contribute to the dismantling of the cell.

Caspase-3 disrupts oxygen consumption induced by complex I and II substrates but not that induced by electron transfer to complex IV. Similarly.

In the present study. we used simulated ischemia (sI) in vitro and IPC of hearts to investigate the role of Parkin in mediating cardioprotection ex vivo and in vivo. In HL-1 cells. sI induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria and mitochondrial elimination. IPC induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts and in vivo in mice subjected to regional IPC. Mitochondrial depolarization with an uncoupling agent similarly induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria in cells and Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. Mitochondrial loss was blunted in Atg5-deficient cells. revealing the requirement for autophagy in mitochondrial elimination. Consistent with previous reports indicating a role for p62/SQSTM1 in mitophagy. we found that depletion of p62 attenuated mitophagy and exacerbated cell death in HL-1 cardiomyocytes subjected to sI. While wild type mice showed p62 translocation to mitochondria and an increase in ubiquitination. Parkin knockout mice exhibited attenuated IPC-induced p62 translocation to the mitochondria.

Mitophagy as a way of life,2010,Roberta A Gottlieb and Raquel S Carreira,299,,2,C203-C210,American Physiological Society,Our understanding of autophagy has expanded greatly in recent years. largely due to the identification of the many genes involved in the process and to the development of better methods to monitor the process. such as green fluorescent protein-LC3 to visualize autophagosomes in vivo. A number of groups have demonstrated a tight connection between autophagy and mitochondrial turnover. Mitochondrial quality control is the process whereby mitochondria undergo successive rounds of fusion and fission with a dynamic exchange of components to segregate functional and damaged elements.

We induced IPC with three cycles of 5 min regional ischemia alternating with 5 min reperfusion and assessed the induction of autophagy in mCherry-LC3 transgenic mice by imaging of fluorescent autophagosomes in cryosections. We found a rapid and significant increase in the number of autophagosomes in the risk zone of the preconditioned hearts. In Langendorff-perfused hearts subjected to an IPC protocol of 3 × 5 min ischemia. we also observed an increase in autophagy within 10 min. as assessed by Western blotting for p62 and cadaverine dye binding.

We have found that this phenomenon requires dramatic remodeling of the mitochondrial network involving both mitochondrial clearance and biogenesis.

We previously showed this regulatory relationship in prostate carcinoma cell lines in vitro. underlying the role of miR-221/222 as inducers of proliferation and tumorigenicity.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a number of in vivo approaches confirming our previous data. The ectopic overexpression of miR-221 is able. per se. to confer a high growth advantage to LNCaP-derived tumors in SCID mice. Consistently. the anti-miR-221/222 antagomir treatment of established subcutaneous tumors derived from the highly aggressive PC3 cell line. naturally expressing high levels of miR-221/222. reduces tumor growth by increasing intratumoral p27 amount; this effect is long lasting. as it is detectable as long as 25 days after the treatment. Furthermore. we provide evidence in favour of a clinical relevance of the role of miR-221/222 in prostate carcinoma. by showing their general upregulation in patient-derived primary cell lines. where we find a significant inverse correlation with p27 expression.

Inducible pluripotent stem cells also display a robust DNA damage response. but the stability of their genome is often conditioned by the mutational history of the cell population of origin. which constitutes an obstacle to clinical applications. Cancer stem cells are particularly tolerant to DNA damage and fail to undergo senescence or regulated cell death upon accumulation of genetic lesions.

Most of the receptor dimer is extracellular. but both subunits traverse the plasma membrane and terminate in short cytoplasmic domains. These domains initiate the assembly of large signaling complexes and thereby bridge the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton.

Vinculin. with its many potential binding partners. can interconnect signals in FAs. Despite the well-characterized structure of vinculin. the molecular mechanisms underlying its action have remained unclear. Here. using vinculin mutants. we separate the vinculin head and tail regions into distinct functional domains. We show that the vinculin head regulates integrin dynamics and clustering and the tail regulates the link to the mechanotransduction force machinery.

Such interactions might be inhibited by synthetic peptide probes derived from the cell-binding regions of matrix molecules. Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) is a pentapeptide sequence that appears to be critical for cell interaction with fibronectin. Coinjection of GRGDS with B16-F10 murine melanoma cells dramatically inhibited the formation of lung colonies in C57BL/6 mice. Two closely related control peptides. in which specific amino acids within the GRGDS sequence were transposed or substituted. displayed little or no activity. Inhibition by GRGDS was dose-dependent. noncytotoxic. and did not result from an impairment of cellular tumorigenicity.

How force regulates integrin–ligand dissociation is unclear. We used atomic force microscopy to measure the force-dependent lifetimes of single bonds between a fibronectin fragment and an integrin α5β1-Fc fusion protein or membrane α5β1. Force prolonged bond lifetimes in the 10–30-pN range. a counterintuitive behavior called catch bonds. Changing cations from Ca2+/Mg2+ to Mg2+/EGTA and to Mn2+ caused longer lifetime in the same 10–30-pN catch bond region. A truncated α5β1 construct containing the headpiece but not the legs formed longer-lived catch bonds that were not affected by cation changes at forces <30 pN.

Rab25 promotes a mode of migration on 3D matrices that is characterized by the extension of long pseudopodia. and the association of the GTPase with α5β1 promotes localization of vesicles that deliver integrin to the plasma membrane at pseudopodial tips as well as the retention of a pool of cycling α5β1 at the cell front.

This is true not only for actively migrating cells that use adhesive contact for traction and guidance. but also for stationary cells that require a platform for support and orientation. Cell-extracellular matrix adhesion has a homeostatic function in promoting tissue regeneration during wound healing. while aberrant adhesion contributes to the aetiology and pathogenesis of a number of major human diseases including arthritis. cardiovascular disease and cancer. Consistent with this multiplicity of function. extracellular matrices exhibit diversity in both composition and three-dimensional structure. The overall phenotypic effects induced by an extracellular matrix are the sum of multiple. specific ligand-receptor recognition events and therefore the relative distribution of receptors and ligands. in terms of both quantity and spatial presentation. needs to be considered. This structural complexity has however hampered progress towards an understanding of adhesive recognition events at the cellular level and. instead. a great deal of research effort has been concentrated on elucidating the mechanisms of adhesion at the molecular level.

Here we show that fibronectin is critical for the incorporation of LTBP1 and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) into the ECM of osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Immunolocalization studies suggested that fibronectin provides an initial scaffold that precedes and patterns LTBP1 deposition but that LTBP1 and fibronectin are later localized in separate fibrillar networks. suggesting that the initial template is lost. Treatment of fetal rat calvarial osteoblasts with a 70-kDa N-terminal fibronectin fragment that inhibits fibronectin assembly impaired incorporation of LTBP1 and TGFβ into the ECM.

VEGF-A164 in mice) and semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A). Nevertheless. Nrp1 null embryos display vascular defects that differ from those of mice lacking either VEGF-A164 or Sema3A proteins. Furthermore. it has been recently reported that Nrp1 is required for endothelial cell (EC) response to both VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121 isoforms. the latter being incapable of binding Nrp1 on the EC surface. Taken together. these data suggest that the vascular phenotype caused by the loss of Nrp1 could be due to a VEGF-A164/SEMA3A-independent function of Nrp1 in ECs. such as adhesion to the extracellular matrix. By using RNA interference and rescue with wild-type and mutant constructs. we show here that Nrp1 through its cytoplasmic SEA motif and independently of VEGF-A165 and SEMA3A specifically promotes α5β1-integrin-mediated EC adhesion to fibronectin that is crucial for vascular development. We provide evidence that Nrp1. while not directly mediating cell spreading on fibronectin. interacts with α5β1 at adhesion sites. Binding of the homomultimeric endocytic adaptor GAIP interacting protein C terminus. member 1 (GIPC1). to the SEA motif of Nrp1 selectively stimulates the internalization of active α5β1 in Rab5-positive early endosomes. Accordingly. GIPC1. which also interacts with α5β1. and the associated motor myosin VI (Myo6) support active α5β1 endocytosis and EC adhesion to fibronectin.

These linkages are dynamic and are influenced in a bidirectional manner by changes in the microenvironment of the plasma membrane that occur both inside and outside of cells. The mechanisms employed by integrins to transduce information are complex. but a series of recent studies has clarified their molecular basis. In particular. explanations for the interdependence of ligand binding. occupancy by divalent cations and receptor conformation have been obtained. and some of the key sites responsible for each property have been localized within the integrin heterodimer.

Human dermal fibroblasts exhibited Arg-Gly-Asp and cation-dependent adhesion to microfibrils and recombinant fibrillin-1 protein fragments. Strong integrin α5β1 interactions with fibrillin ligands were identified. but integrin αvβ3 also contributed to cell adhesion. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis confirmed the presence of abundant α5β1 and some αvβ3 receptors on these cells. Adhesion to microfibrils and to Arg-Gly-Aspcontaining fibrillin-1 protein fragments induced signaling events that led to cell spreading. altered cytoskeletal organization. and enhanced extracellular fibrillin-1 deposition.

We have attempted to map the fibronectin binding interface on α5β1 using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit ligand recognition. The binding of two anti-α5 mAbs (P1D6 and JBS5) to α5β1 was strongly inhibited by a tryptic CCBD fragment of fibronectin (containing both synergy sequence and RGD) but not by GRGDS peptide. Using recombinant wild type and mutated fragments of the CCBD. we show that the synergy region of the 9th type III repeat is involved in blocking the binding of P1D6 and JBS5 to α5β1.

Engagement of syndecan-4 is essential for adhesion formation in cells adhering via certain integrins. and for cell proliferation and migration in response to growth factors. The cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 interacts with a number of signalling and structural proteins. and both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains are necessary for regulated activation of associated transmembrane receptors.

Because humans lived as foragers for 95% of our species’ history. we analyzed co-residence patterns among 32 present-day foraging societies (total n = 5067 individuals. mean experienced band size = 28.2 adults). We found that hunter-gatherers display a unique social structure where (i) either sex may disperse or remain in their natal group.

The Native American populations have lower genetic diversity and greater differentiation than populations from other continental regions. We observe gradients both of decreasing genetic diversity as a function of geographic distance from the Bering Strait and of decreasing genetic similarity to Siberians—signals of the southward dispersal of human populations from the northwestern tip of the Americas. We also observe evidence of: (1) a higher level of diversity and lower level of population structure in western South America compared to eastern South America.

We found extensive variation in Native American and European ancestry (and generally low levels of African ancestry) among populations and individuals. and evidence that admixture across Latin America has often involved predominantly European men and both Native and African women. An admixture analysis allowing for Native American population subdivision revealed a differentiation of the Native American ancestry amongst Mestizos. This observation is consistent with the genetic structure of pre-Columbian populations and with admixture having involved Natives from the area where the Mestizo examined are located.

We explain this variation in inequality using a dynamic model in which a population’s long-run steady-state level of inequality depends on the extent to which its most important forms of wealth are transmitted within families across generations. We estimate the degree of intergenerational transmission of three different types of wealth (material. embodied. and relational). as well as the extent of wealth inequality in 21 historical and contemporary populations. We show that intergenerational transmission of wealth and wealth inequality are substantial among pastoral and small-scale agricultural societies (on a par with or even exceeding the most unequal modern industrial economies) but are limited among horticultural and foraging peoples (equivalent to the most …,True,_1pIHHMAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,391,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5953/682.abstract,16594158965516110973,/scholar?cites=16594158965516110973,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2792081/,0,0,0

Asymmetry and departures from average proportions may be markers of the breakdown of developmental stability. Supernormal traits may present age- and sex-typical features in exaggerated form. Evidence from social psychology suggests that both average proportions and (in females) “neotenous” facial traits are indeed more attractive.

10104584,The evolution of premature reproductive senescence and menopause in human females,1991,Kim Hill and A Magdalena Hurtado,2,Human Nature,4,313-350,Springer-Verlag,Reproductive senescence in human females takes place long before other body functions senesce. This fact presents an evolutionary dilemma since continued reproduction should generally be favored by natural selection. Two commonly proposed hypotheses to account for human menopause are (a) a recent increase in the human lifespan and (b) a switch to investment in close kin rather than direct reproduction. No support is found for the proposition that human lifespans have only recently increased. Data from Ache hunter-gatherers are used to test the kin selection hypothesis. Ache data do not support the proposition that females can gain greater fitness benefits in old age by helping kin rather than continuing to reproduce.

Cooperative activities are defined as those that entail a cost of time and energy to the donor but primarily lead to an increase in the foraging success of the recipient. Data show that Ache men and women spend about 10% of all foraging time engaged in altruistic cooperation on average. and that on some days they may spend more than 50% of their foraging time in such activities. The most time-consuming cooperative activity for both sexes is helping during the pursuit of game animals. a pattern that is probably linked to the widespread sharing of game by Ache foragers.

The proposal that men hunt wild game as a form of status signaling or “showing off” to provide reproductive benefits to the hunter challenges the traditional view that men hunt to provision their families. Two broad assumptions underlie the signaling view: (1) hunting is a poor means of obtaining food. and (2) hunted game is a public good shared widely with others and without expectation of future reciprocation. If hunters lack the ability to direct food shares and obtain subsequent benefits contingent on redistribution. then the ubiquitous observations of male hunting and universal pair‐bonding cannot be explained from a perspective that emphasizes kin provisioning and a division of labor.

The literature on female foraging behavior indicates that there is considerable variation within and across foraging societies in the amount of time that women spend foraging and in the amount and types of food that they acquire.

Nutritional practices. exercise requirements. and body composition are nonreproductive influences that have been proposed as additional factors affecting the incidence of women's cancers. In each case. these would further increase risk for women in industrialized countries relative to forager women. Lifestyles and reproductive patterns new from an evolutionary perspective may promote women's cancer. Calculations based on a theoretical model suggest that. to age 60. modern Western women have a breast cancer risk as much as 100 times that of preagricultural women.,True,_1pIHHMAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,249,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/418650,10884552576158339793,/scholar?cites=10884552576158339793,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Trussell/publication/15225920_Women's_Reproductive_Cancers_in_Evolutionary_Context/links/00b7d52a866b4b8661000000.pdf,0,0,0
10104602,Paternal effect on offspring survivorship among Ache and Hiwi hunter-gatherers: Implications for modeling pair-bond stability,1992,A Magdalena Hurtado and Kim R Hill,,Father-child relations: Cultural and biosocial contexts,,31-55,,The effects of father absence on child morbidity and mortality constitute an area of considerable interest in the medical and social sciences (Desai 1970; Franklin and Vial 1981; Marchione 1980; Brown 1973; Lancaster 1988 and references therein; Epenshade 1979; Daly and Wilson 1985; Berklov and Sklar 1976; Jason et al. 1983; Golding et al. 1986; Skjaerven and Irgens 1988). The few studies that have been conducted indicate that there are large differences in the effects of father absence on child survivorship across societies. In some populations the absence of fathers leads to a decrease in child health while in others paternal abandonment may lead to an increase or to no change in the health of offspring (see Lancaster 1988). For example. some studies show that in modern economies with well-developed health care systems child survivorship is negatively affected by the absence of fathers (eg. Sweden. see Skjaerven and Irgens 1988). while in less developed countries child survivorship is sometimes positively associated with father absence (eg. Dominican Republic. Brown 1973). Interestingly. this high variation in paternal effects on child health across human populations is paralleled by a rich diversity in human mating systems. In recent years. anthropologists specializing in human behavioral ecology have become increasingly interested in the relationship between mortality in offspring and the differential distribution of parental care and male and female mating strategies (Draper and Harpending 1982; Kaplan and Hill 1985a; Harpending and Draper 1986; Pennington and,True,_1pIHHMAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,214,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=pi-Hd1jabbgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA31&dq=info:VeVvEA4LiLwJ:scholar.google.com&ots=UO87VJ26vn&sig=vfPLJl_HVF7GC4ZoEhwnQhkxHhI,13585120430996317525,/scholar?cites=13585120430996317525,,,0,0,0

It is suggested that much of what has been considered conservation by native peoples is probably epiphenomenal. The misidentification of apparent conservation as genuine is a result of the focus on sustained harvests rather than on behaviors that not only aim at increasing the sustainability of the harvest in the long term but also are costly in the short term. Optimal foraging models are here used to generate alternative predictions to those of conservation. Data on the intraspecific prey choice of the Piro. subsistence hunters of the Peruvian Neotropics. indicate that they do not selectively choose sex and age types that minimize the impact on prey populations. Rather. their decisions are more closely predicted by optimal foraging theory …,True,_1pIHHMAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,212,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/204432,9459337435763448265,/scholar?cites=9459337435763448265,,http://aplicacoes.jbrj.gov.br/enbt/mestrado_profissional/seminario/21_Alvard%201995.pdf,0,0,0
10104604,Evolutionary history of hunter-gatherer marriage practices,2011,Robert S Walker and Kim R Hill and Mark V Flinn and Ryan M Ellsworth,6,PloS one,4,e19066,Public Library of Science,Background The universality of marriage in human societies around the world suggests a deep evolutionary history of institutionalized pair-bonding that stems back at least to early modern humans. However. marriage practices vary considerably from culture to culture. ranging from strict prescriptions and arranged marriages in some societies to mostly unregulated courtship in others. presence to absence of brideservice and brideprice. and polyandrous to polygynous unions. The ancestral state of early human marriage is not well known given the lack of conclusive archaeological evidence.   Methodology Comparative phylogenetic analyses using data from contemporary hunter-gatherers around the world may allow for the reconstruction of ancestral human cultural traits. We attempt to reconstruct ancestral marriage practices using hunter-gatherer phylogenies based on mitochondrial DNA sequences.   Results Arranged marriages are inferred to go back at least to first modern human migrations out of Africa. Reconstructions are equivocal on whether or not earlier human marriages were arranged because several African hunter-gatherers have courtship marriages. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest that marriages in early ancestral human societies probably had low levels of polygyny (low reproductive skew) and reciprocal exchanges between the families of marital partners (i.e.. brideservice or brideprice).   Discussion Phylogenetic results suggest a deep history of regulated exchange of mates and resources among lineages that enhanced the complexity of human meta-group social structure with coalitions and alliances spanning across …,True,_1pIHHMAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC,209,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019066,4159363344295263141,/scholar?cites=4159363344295263141,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019066,0,0,0

The intense level of Waorani warfare and the existence of infanticide make the Waorani an ideal testing site for the hypothesis; warfare and infanticide are a competitive response to scarce resources. particularly protein. Waorani use shotguns along with traditional technology to supply an average as high as 250 g of edible meat per person per day; using traditional technology. they could provide 190 g per person per day. These yields fall within the range of levels published for eight other groups in Amazonia. The Waorani exhibit high levels of health and nutritional status partly because they are consuming protein at levels in generous excess of those established by nutritionists as adequate.

10104607,Yanomami: the fierce controversy and what we can learn from it,2005,Rob Borofsky and Bruce Albert,12,,,,Univ of California Press,Yanomami raises questions central to the field of anthropology—questions concerning the practice of fieldwork. the production of knowledge. and anthropology's intellectual and ethical vision of itself. Using the Yanomami controversy—one of anthropology's most famous and explosive imbroglios—as its starting point. this book draws readers into not only reflecting on but refashioning the very heart and soul of the discipline. It is both the most up-to-date and thorough public discussion of the Yanomami controversy available and an innovative and searching assessment of the current state of anthropology. The Yanomami controversy came to public attention through the publication of Patrick Tierney's best-selling book. Darkness in El Dorado. in which he accuses James Neel. a prominent geneticist who belonged to the National Academy of Sciences. as well as Napoleon Chagnon. whose introductory text on the Yanomami is perhaps the best-selling anthropological monograph of all time. of serious human rights violations. This book identifies the ethical dilemmas of the controversy and raises deeper. structural questions about the discipline. A portion of the book is devoted to a unique roundtable in which important scholars on different sides of the issues debate back and forth with each other. This format draws readers into deciding. for themselves. where they stand on the controversy’s—and many of anthropology’s—central concerns.

Both of these traits and others are linked by life-history theory to mortality rates experienced at different ages by our hominin ancestors. However. currently there is a great deal of debate concerning hominin mortality profiles at different periods of evolutionary history.

Part of the field of competence of NMR is represented by molecules with unpaired electrons. which are called paramagnetic. The presence of unpaired electrons is at the same time a drawback (negative effect) and a precious source of information about structure and dynamics. New phenomena and effects are described which are due to the high magnetic fields and advances in the methodology. Solution NMR of Paramagnetic Molecules is unique in dealing with these matters. The scope is that of presenting a complete description. which is both rigorous and pictorial. of theory and experiments of NMR of paramagnetic molecules in solution. Pertinent examples are described. From the time dependent behaviour of electrons in the various metal ions including polimetallic systems to the hyperfine-based information. and from NMR experiments to constraints for solution structure determination.

Comprehensive solid-state NMR (SSNMR) structural studies on uniformly isotope-labeled Aβ assemblies have been hampered for a long time by sample heterogeneity and low spectral resolution. In this work. SSNMR studies on well-ordered fibril samples of Aβ40 with an additional N-terminal methionine provide high-resolution spectra which lead to an accurate structural model. The fibrils studied here carry distinct structural features compared to previous reports. The inter-β-strand contacts within the U-shaped β-strand-turn-β-strand motif are shifted. the N-terminal region adopts a β-conformation. and new inter-monomer contacts occur at the protofilament interface.

Its drawback. compared to many other spectroscopic techniques is its intrinsic low sensitivity due to the small energy splitting of nuclear spin states. Therefore improving sensitivity is a key issue in NMR spectroscopy. Several important inventions have boosted the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy and allowed new application areas to be explored. NMR signal intensity and chemical shift resolution has been improved by increasing the external magnetic field strength. Further improvements have been made using nuclear–nuclear cross-polarization schemes. usually from protons (with a large gyromagnetic ratio) to carbon-13 or nitrogen-15 (with much smaller gyromagnetic ratios. cp/cc $4 for carbon and cp/cn $10 for nitrogen)[1]. Cryogenic cooling of the coil. while keeping the sample at room temperature. additionally improved the sensitivity by a factor of about 3. Overhauser proposed the idea to polarize nuclei in metals by applying microwave excitation to the electron resonance transition [2]. The experimental proof of this concept on Li metal at low magnetic fields appeared even before the theoretical paper was published [3]. Soon. this concept was extended to polarization transfer from free radicals to solvent molecules [4] and numerous applications in liquids were found [5. 6].

Their field dependence. due to increasing partial orientation of the molecule in solution at high magnetic fields. provides structural constraints relative to the orientation of the NH bond vector with respect to the principal directions of the molecular susceptibility tensor. The constraints have been used in a distance geometry algorithm together with the NOE constraints and with or without pseudocontact shifts constraints. The three sets of constraints are found to be consistent with one another. and their relative contribution to the definition of the structure depends on the number of constraints and their assigned weight.

Although air pollution by chemicalcarcinogens may not be entirely responsible for this urban factor (2). it is to a great degree a contributory cause. Consequently. the interest in identification and routine measurements of a wide range of such carcinogens has steadily been increasing. Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are the largest known group of chemical carcinogens that are created during various combustion processes and found in airborne partic-ulates. Many procedures. based on various chromatographic and spectroscopic principles. were developed for the analysis of PAH.

We define peptide detectability as the probability of observing a peptide in a standard sample analyzed by a standard proteomics routine and argue that it is an intrinsic property of the peptide sequence and neighboring regions in the parent protein. To test this hypothesis we first used publicly available data and data from our own synthetic samples in which quantities of model proteins were controlled.

The vast majority of man-made particulates exhibit a spherical shape as a result of surface energy minimization during their synthesis. The advent of phage display libraries. which are revealing the extraordinary molecular diversity of endothelial cells. and the development of processes for fabricating particles with shapes other than spherical are opening the path to new design solutions for systemically administered targeted particulates. In this paper. the role of particle geometry (i.e.. size and shape) is discussed at the tissue and cellular scales.

Such peptide ligands. or antibodies directed against specific vascular receptors. can be used to target therapeutic compounds or imaging agents to endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Recent advances in the field include identification of novel endothelial receptors expressed differentially in normal and pathological conditions and the isolation of peptides or antibody ligands to such receptors in in vitro assays. in animal models and in a human patient.

This developmentally regulated membrane-spanning chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan is expressed primarily by glial. muscle. and cartilage progenitor cells. Upon maturation. these cell types down-regulate NG2 expression. In adult animals. the expression of NG2 is restricted to tumor cells and angiogenic tumor vasculature. making this proteoglycan a potential target for directing therapeutic agents to relevant sites of action. To this end. we have identified specific NG2-binding peptides by screening a phage-displayed random peptide library on purified NG2. Several rounds of biopanning on NG2 resulted in the specific enrichment of two phage-displayed decapeptides. TAASGVRSMH and LTLRWVGLMS.

We investigated the function of CD43 by using gene targeting to eliminate CD43 expression in the human T lymphocyte line CEM and then testing their adhesive phenotype. Loss of CD43 expression by the CEM cells enhanced their homotypic adhesion and binding to two distinct ligands. fibronectin and HIV-1 gp120. The enhanced homotypic adhesion was blocked specifically by an anti-beta 1 integrin mAb. and the enhanced binding to fibronectin and gp120 was blocked specifically by anti-beta 1 integrin and anti-CD4 mAb. respectively. Partial reconstitution of CD43 expression in the CD43-negative cells resulted in a corresponding reversion to a less adhesive phenotype.

Given DNA-microarray data for a set of cells characterized by a given phenotype and for a set of control cells. an important problem is to identify “patterns” of gene expression that can be used to predict cell phenotype. The potential number of such patterns is exponential in the number of genes.In this paper. we propose a solution to this problem based on a supervised learning algorithm. which differs substantially from previous schemes. It couples a complex. non-linear similarity metric. which maximizes the probability of discovering discriminative gene expression patterns. and a pattern discovery algorithm called SPLASH. The latter discovers efficiently and deterministically all statistically significant gene expression patterns in the phenotype set. Statistical significance is evaluated based on the probability of a pattern to occur by chance in the control set.

However. it is not fully understood at which stages of B-cell development the CD40 pathway is activated in vivo. To address this question. we induced CD40 signaling in human transformed GC B cells in vitro and identified a CD40 gene expression signature by DNA microarray analysis. This signature was then investigated in the gene expression profiles of normal B cells and found in pre- and post-GC B cells (naive and memory) but. surprisingly. not in GC B cells. This finding was validated in lymphoid tissues by showing that the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factors. which translocate to the nucleus upon CD40 stimulation. are retained in the cytoplasm in most GC B cells. indicating the absence of CD40 signaling.

The amplitude of the CP-violating asymmetry. which in the standard model is proportional to sin 2 β. is derived from the decay time distributions in such events. The result sin 2 β= 0.59±0.14 (stat)±0.05 (syst) establishes CP violation in the B 0 meson system. We also determine| λ|= 0.93±0.09 (stat)±0.03 (syst). consistent with no direct CP violation.,True,JT_OTAIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1300,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.091801,10461864527557726711,/scholar?cites=10461864527557726711,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/0107013,0,0,0

B 八 B 八 R and Belle. to work together on a book that would describe the methodologies used and physics results obtained by those experiments. A key ideal emphasized from the outset was that this book should be written from a pedagogical perspective; it should be of interest to the student and expert alike. This vision was presented during a B 八 B 八 R collaboration meeting on the island of Elba in May 2008 and a follow up Belle collaboration meeting at KEK. with visiting colleagues from the B 八 B 八 R collaboration. and was embraced by the community. A number of workshops involving people from the theoretical community as well as the two collaborations were held on four continents over the following years.

The data sample used for this purpose consists of events in which one B 0 meson is reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode. while the flavor of the recoiling B 0 is determined with a tagging algorithm that exploits the correlation between the flavor of the heavy quark and the charges of its decay products. From the time development of the observed mixed and unmixed final states. we determine the B 0− B 0 oscillation frequency Δ m d to be 0.516±0.016 (stat)±0.010 (syst) ps− 1.,True,JT_OTAIAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,126,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.221802,16472466847087341908,/scholar?cites=16472466847087341908,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/0112044,0,0,0
