The overall bilayer structure is largely preserved upon removal from water. although significant loss of material occurs from the upper leaflet of the bilayer. likely due to desorption at the air/water interface. The morphology and surface structure of the bilayer. as observed by AFM. indicate a substantially different arrangement of the lipids in the hydrated and dehydrated states. presumably due to the loss of water from the near surface region. These changes have been correlated with infrared spectral shifts sensitive to the conformation of the hydrocarbon chains.

1208154,Cross-linking polymerization in two-dimensional assemblies: Effect of the reactive group site,1999,Sanchao Liu and David F O'Brien,32,Macromolecules,17,5519-5524,American Chemical Society,The cross-linking polymerization of hydrated amphiphiles in monolayers. bilayers. and nonlamellar phases. i.e.. bicontinuous cubic and the inverted hexagonal phases. is an effective method to modify their properties. Polymerization of monomeric amphiphiles in an assembly proceeds in a linear or cross-linking manner depending on the number and location of polymerizable groups per monomer. Polymerization of hydrated lipids with reactive groups in each hydrophobic tail yields cross-linked polymers. Sisson et al. (1996) examined the cross-linking of bilayers as a function of the mole fraction of bis-substituted lipids (bis-SorbPC). where the reactive groups were located at the end of the lipid tails. The onset of cross-linking was determined by changes in lipid lateral diffusion. bilayer vesicle stability. and polymer solubility.

A well-known strategy for cross-linking of lipids in lyotropic phases is the inclusion of identical reactive groups in each hydrophobic tail of the lipids. An alternative approach is to incorporate two similar but distinct groups into different locations within a single hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile. In principle. these heterobifunctional amphiphiles could react to form ladderlike polymers or cross-linked polymers. This report describes the synthesis. characterization. and polymerization in lipid vesicles of two series of heterobifunctional phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids with different separation distances between the two reactive groups.

Much work has been done to elucidate the pathways for utilization of aldoses. but little is known about metabolism of more oxidized substrates. Two oxidized hexose derivatives. gluconate and galacturonate. are present in low cost feedstocks. and their metabolism will contribute to overall metabolic output of these substrates. A complete metabolic network for glucose. gluconate. and galacturonate utilization was generated using online databases. previous studies. genomic context. and experimental data. Gluconate appears to be metabolized via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. and is likely dehydrated to 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate before phosphorylation to 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-P-gluconate. Galacturonate appears to be processed via the Ashwell pathway. converging on a common metabolite for gluconate and galacturonate metabolism. 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate. As expected. increasingly oxidized substrates resulted in increasingly oxidized products with galacturonate fermentations being nearly homoacetic. Calculations of expected ATP and reducing equivalent yields and experimental data suggested galacturonate fermentations were reductant limited. Galacturonate fermentation was incomplete. which was not due solely to product inhibition or the inability to utilize low concentrations of galacturonate.

Recently. it was demonstrated that xylose is not appreciably fermented in the presence of arabinose. revealing a hierarchy of pentose utilization in this organism (L. Aristilde. I. A. Lewis. J. O. Park. and J. D. Rabinowitz. Appl Environ Microbiol 81:1452–1462. 2015. https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.03199-14). The goal of the current study is to characterize the transcriptional regulation that occurs and perhaps drives this pentose hierarchy. Carbohydrate consumption rates showed that arabinose. like glucose. actively represses xylose utilization in cultures fermenting xylose.

Fermentative organisms such as Clostridium sp. adjust their metabolic state to make the most efficient use of substrates with different oxidation states. They do this by altering the recycling of reduced electron carriers such as NADH and NADPH. In general. the higher the oxidation state of a substrate. the less NAD (P) H it generates in its catabolism 35. During homoacetic fermentation on galacturonate 28. the batch fermentation was thought to be incomplete regardless of product inhibition or low substrate utilization. Also. galacturonate-grown cells exhibited reduced growth rates when the fermentation culture was agitated. suggesting loss in H2 reductant. required for redox balancing. A detailed pathway of these carriers when C. acetobutylicum is fed three substrates (galacturonate. gluconate. glucose) of different oxidation states is presented in Fig. 1. below. The figure is an updated pathway from an earlier publication which includes pathways for mannitol and gylcerol utilization 38. 39. Figure 1 shows that from uptake to acetyl-CoA a combination of 0.3 ATP/0NADH is produced during galacturonate utilization. 0.3 ATP/0.5 NADH for gluconate. 1ATP/1NADH for glucose. 1ATP/1.5 NADH for mannitol. and 0.6 ATP/2NADH for glycerol. These ratios thus present discreet points of operation during individual substrate feeding.Growth on singular and mixed substrates. One strain.

Butanol is a commodity chemical due in part to its suitability as a biofuel; however. the current yield of this product from biological systems is not economically feasible as an alternative fuel source. Understanding solvent phase physiology. solvent tolerance. and their genetic underpinning is key for future strain optimization of the bacterium. This study shows the importance of a [NiFe]-hydrogenase in solvent phase physiology. C. acetobutylicum genes ca_c0810 and ca_c0811. annotated as a HypF and HypD maturation factor. were found to be required for [NiFe]-hydrogenase activity. They were shown to be part of a polycistronic operon with other hyp genes. Hydrogenase activity assays of the ΔhypF/hypD mutant showed an almost complete inactivation of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase. Metabolic studies comparing ΔhypF/hypD and wild type (WT) strains in planktonic and sessile conditions indicated the hydrogenase was important for solvent phase metabolism. For the mutant. reabsorption of acetate and butyrate was inhibited during solventogenesis in planktonic cultures. and less ABE was produced. During sessile growth. the ΔhypF/hypD mutant had higher initial acetone: butanol ratios. which is consistent with the inability to obtain reduced cofactors via H 2 uptake. In sessile conditions. the ΔhypF/hypD mutant was inhibited in early solventogenesis. but it appeared to remodel its metabolism and produced mainly butanol in late solventogenesis without the uptake of acids.

For a given macrocycle. decomposition of the Schiff-base into component amine and carbonyl compound is dependent on which lanthanide ion is used.

We show that a regional analysis of the reduced density gradient. as provided by the recently introduced Non-Covalent Interactions (NCI) index. transcends AIM theory to deliver a chemically intuitive description of hydrogen bonding for a series of 1.n-alkanediols. This regional definition of interactions overcomes the known caveat of only analyzing electron density critical points. In other words. the NCI approach is a simple and elegant generalization of the bond critical point approach. which raises the title question.

The OH- and OD-stretching bands in the jet-cooled spectra are about 1−10 cm-1 wide and generally show a few Lorentzian shaped peaks.

The band profiles in the jet-cooled spectra arise mostly from nonstatistical intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) with specific coupling to “doorway” states. which are likely to involve CH- and CD-stretching vibrations.

OH-. and NH-stretching vibrations in the fundamental and overtone regions from 2000 cm−1 to ~18000 cm−1. Both conventional and photoacoustic spectroscopic techniques were used.   The first section of this study is concerned with the intensities of the vibrational overtones of SH-. NH-. CH- and OH-stretching oscillators. It was observed that the oscillator strengths of SH-stretching transitions were markedly smaller than oscillator strengths for OH- and NH-stretching transitions. Using the local mode anharmonic oscillator method. the intensity was deconstructed into dipole and anharmonic components to find where the differences in intensity between similar moieties originates. In both cases. the dipole component of the oscillator strength was found to have a larger influence on the oscillator strength than the anharmonic component.   The second section involved observing weak intramolecular hydrogen bonds and intramolecular hydrogen bond-like interactions. Six different species were recorded to find spectral evidence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding between OH and S. SH and O.

C–C bond desaturation. and heterocyclic ring formation. Their active sites. as represented by taurine: αketoglutarate dioxygenase (TauD). 1. 2 generally consist of a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad that serves to bind the iron (II) center. In the nonheme iron halogenase enzymes. the carboxylate is replaced by a chloride or a bromide. which is the atom that is incorporated into the C–H bond. Reaction of the reduced enzymes with O2 leads to the generation of highvalent oxoiron intermediates responsible for the critical C–H cleavage step (Scheme 1).

1208253,The Chemistry of S= 2 Nonheme Oxoiron (IV) Complexes,2016,Mayank Puri,,,,,,Nonheme oxoiron(IV) intermediates are proposed to be involved in a number of important biological oxidation reactions. where all characterized examples thus far have a S = 2 ground spin state. In contrast. the majority of synthetic nonheme oxoiron(IV) complexes have a S = 1 ground spin state. In order to gain a deeper understanding of these important biological species. it is critical to expand the number of synthetic S = 2 nonheme oxoiron(IV) complexes and to study their reactivity with organic substrates.  This thesis explores a synthetic strategy to obtain S = 2 nonheme oxoiron(IV) complexes by utilizing weak-field equatorial quinoline donors. in contrast to the relatively strong-field pyridine donors that are often used. The resulting S = 2 nonheme oxoiron(IV) complexes demonstrate spectroscopic signatures similar to those of the enzymatic oxoiron(IV) intermediates and reproduce the reactivity observed by these nonheme iron enzymes. Thus. this research has given rise to the first electronic and functional models of the nonheme oxoiron(IV) intermediates found in the enzymes TauD. CytC3 and SyrB2.  In addition. the reactivity of known S = 1 nonheme oxoiron(IV) complexes were explored in the context of oxygen-atom exchange with H2O. which is an important reaction in tracking metal-oxo intermediates proposed to be involved in catalytic substrate oxidation reactions. Finally. a six-coordinate S = 1 nonheme imidoiron(IV) complex supported by a tetradentate ligand was synthesized and compared to its isoelectronic S = 1 nonheme oxoiron(IV) analogue.,True,tWHrbP8AAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC,0,https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/181650,,,,https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/181650/Puri_umn_0130E_17187.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

A combination of both physical and chemical parameters provided a flexible basis to widely regulate the size of the microspheres. The controlled granulation is based on a stable alumina suspension containing sodium alginate. The sodium alginate binder is used to coagulate the microspheres jetted into a bath of CaCl2. Several parameters have been varied to study the impact on the suspension’s rheology. This in turn dictates the physical parameters required for controlled shaping by the vibrational droplet coagulation technique. The decomposition of the calcium alginate in the alumina microspheres was monitored during the thermal post processing.

Substantial evidence indicates that protein nitrotyrosination contributes to Aβ-dependent neurotoxicity; however. the molecular mechanism is unknown. Recent research has shown that Aβ complexes with heme to form Aβ–heme. and increases the pseudo-peroxidase activity of heme. We found that Aβ–heme uses H2O2 and NO2 − to cause nitration of enolase and synaptic proteins more effectively than heme. Thus. the increased peroxidase activity of Aβ–heme may be the molecular link between excess Aβ and the widespread protein nitration in AD.

For full efficacy. both the pattern and the amount of hormone release are critical. It is therefore important to understand how insulin levels are secreted from single islets in both a quantitative fashion and in a manner that resolves temporal dynamics. In this study. we describe a microfluidic analytical system that can both quantitatively monitor insulin secretion from single islets while simultaneously maintaining high temporal sampling to resolve dynamics of release. We have applied this system to determine the acute and chronic effects of a recently-identified lipid. 5-palmitic acid hydroxy stearic acid (5-PAHSA). which is a member of the fatty acid hydroxy fatty acid class of lipids that are upregulated in healthy individuals.

Amino acids. released from various cells within islets or from intrapancreatic neurons. are hypothesized to further adjust hormone secretions. In contrast to the well-accepted mechanism of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. several questions remain as to the function of amino acids in the regulation of hormone release from islets. To understand the autocrine and paracrine roles that amino acids play in islet physiology. a microfluidic system was developed to perform online monitoring of the secretion profiles of amino acids from 2–5 islets.

Elevated separation temperatures due to Joule heating promotes complex dissociation leading to a reduction in sensitivity. Affinity assays performed in glass microfluidic devices may be especially prone to this problem due to poor heat dissipation due to the low thermal conductivity of glass and the large amount of bulk material surrounding separation channels. To address this limitation. a method to cool a glass microfluidic chip for performing an affinity assay for insulin was achieved by a Peltier cooler localized over the separation channel.

The results showed that glasses containing sulfur (S) exhibited a high performance. such as specific capacitance. energy density and power density. compared with the S-free glass. These properties increased with increasing of S content. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the glasses containing S can be attributed to the partial substitution of oxygen (O) atoms by S atoms. Since the radius of S ion is higher than O ion. this substitution can significantly enlarge the size of Li-ion transfer pathway. Besides. S ion has better polarization ability than O ion. thus weakens the …,True,3GLRo8YAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157266571730663X,14258130037735681553,/scholar?cites=14258130037735681553,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hassan_Hassan19/publication/319948486_Effect_of_sulfur_addition_on_the_electrochemical_performance_of_lithium-vanadium-phosphate_glasses_as_electrodes_for_energy_storage_devices/links/59d64c92aca27213df9e76ef/Effect-of-sulfur-addition-on-the-electrochemical-performance-of-lithium-vanadium-phosphate-glasses-as-electrodes-for-energy-storage-devices.pdf,0,0,0

1208335,Mixed (ion and electron) conducting polymers. with applications in batteries,2011,Suputtra Visetpotjanakit,,,,,,A new method to fabricate 3D batteries using mixed (ion and electron) conducting polymers as electrolytes has been developed. The majority of the work was done using the polymer Poly(1.11-Di(N-pyrryl)-3.6.9-trioxaundecane) (PP2O3) because it demonstrated mixed conducting properties. Methods are presented for synthesising the monomer then polymerising either electrochemically to give films or chemically to give bulk samples or powders. The conductivities of both polymers were determined by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). For polymer films prepared electrochemically on conducting substrates. the conductivities were determined as a function of the p-doping level. using a cell containing a liquid electrolyte and an applied bias potential. The results were fitted with a transmission line model and revealed an electronic conductivity varying from 4.20 x10-10 to 1.69 x10-5 S/cm dependent on the doping level. and a relatively constant ionic conductivity of 1.74 x10-6 S/cm. Oxidative treatment by overdoping resulted in a reduction of electronic conductivity by a factor of about 50.000 times smaller at the potential of maximum conductivity. around 0.30 V with a small change in the ionic conductivity. Bulk samples of the chemically prepared polymer were examined between two blocking electrodes. The electronic conductivities of the as-prepared and chemically oxidized samples were both quite low. around 10-7 and 10-8 S/cm. whereas the ionic conductivity of both samples was around 10-5 and 10-6 S/cm. These values were slightly higher than those of the film samples due to a presence of PC plasticiser in bulk samples.

It is well-documented that standard amounts of fluoride in drinkingwater can decrease the rate of dental caries. This study was conducted with the aim of measuring fluoride concentration of drinking-water supplies and urban distribution system in Qom. Iran.Materials and Methods: Results were subsequently compared against national and international standards. All sources of drinking-water of rural and urban areas were examined. To measure fluoride. the standard SPADNS method and a DR/4000s spectrophotometer were used.Results: Results showed that the mean of fluoride concentration in rural areas. mainly supplied with groundwater sources. was 0.41 mg/L. that of the urban distribution system 0.82 mg/L. that of Ali-Abad station 0.11 mg/L. and that of the private water desalination system 0.24 mg/L. Due to the hot climate of Qom. fluoride concentration means of all sources were lower than the permissible standards set by Iranian Standards and the WHO guidelines (except those of some of the groundwater sources and urban distribution systems).Conclusion: It seems that in most of the drinking-water sources the average fluoride concentration is not enough to prevent dental caries or strengthen dental enamel.

1208502,Hydrotropic extraction of curcuminoids from turmeric,2003,Deepak V Dandekar and VG Gaikar,38,Separation science and technology,5,1185-1215,Taylor & Francis Group,A novel hydrotropy-based extraction method for selective extraction of curcuminoids from Curcuma longa (turmeric) was investigated. The degree of extraction was dependent upon the effect of a hydrotrope on the cellular structure and hydrotrope–curcuminoids interactions. Hydrotropes directly affect the cell structure. making curcuminoids more accessible either by dissolution of the cell membrane/wall constituents or by disorganizing cell wall. Sodium cumene sulfonate (Na-CuS) was found to be an efficient hydrotrope for the extraction of curcuminoids. A significantly strong interaction with sodium n-butyl benzene sulfonate (Na-NBBS) of curcuminoids was undesirable in the recovery of curcuminoids from the extract phase. although Na-NBBS was extremely efficient in extracting curcuminoids.

In the process of understanding the health benefits of citrus. we need to isolate and characterize these compounds. Limonoids are one of such prominent. but lesser-known phytonutrients that have been shown to prevent cancers of the mouth. skin. lung. breast. and colon. With the growing interest in the health-promoting properties of citrus limonoids. the demand for these bioactives has significantly increased. It has been critical to explore environment-friendly extraction methods rather than using hazardous organic solvents. A water-based hydrotropic extraction of limonoid aglycones from sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.) seeds was developed. Two hydrotropes. sodium salicylate (Na-Sal) and sodium cumene sulfonate (Na-CuS). were studied for extraction efficiency using the Box Behnken experiment design method. The extraction efficiency of prominent aglycone limonin was observed depending on hydrotrope concentration. extraction temperature. and percentage of raw material loading. Response Surface Analysis (RSA) of data predicted the optimum conditions for maximum yield. Recovery of aglycones from filtered extract is also easily achieved by mere dilution using water at pH 3 or 7 or by partitioning the extract with dichloromethane. At optimum conditions. limonin yield of 0.46 mg/g seeds in the case of Na-Sal extraction and 0.65 mg/g seeds in the case of Na-CuS extraction was achieved. The results demonstrated that the hydrotropic extraction process of limonoid aglycones has practical commercial importance.

L. (Lamiaceae) is one of the most widespread herbal species used in the area of human health and in the foodprocessing industry. Salvia and its extracts are known to be a rich source of antioxidants. As shown previously. the crude ethanolic extract of salvia (SE) exerts lower anti-oxidative properties in lard compared to the new salvia food formulations No. 1 (SF1; 32% of SE + 68% of the emulsifier Dimodan S-T) and No. 2 (SF2; 32% of SE + 68% of the emulsifier Topcithin 50).The aim of the present study was to investigate and compare the effects of the SE and its food formulations SF1 and SF2 on the toxicity and/or proliferation of L1210 leukemia cells. We found that SE and both SF1 and SF2 demonstrated different concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxic/antiproliferative cellular effects already within the first 24 h of the treatment. However. SE was nearly 10 times more effective than the new salvia food formulations SF1 and SF2.We investigated partially also the molecular mechanisms lying behind the action of SE. SF1 and SF2 induced apoptosis in our cell model. We found an apparent involvement of the mitochondrial/caspase-dependent pathway in the described processes. Nevertheless. further investigation is needed before salvia extract and its new antioxidant formulations can be included among the potential food antioxidants with protective properties against cancer.,True,MmxaOK0AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,18,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/intox/7/3/article-p146.xml,10639780963404393814,/scholar?cites=10639780963404393814,,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/intox/7/3/article-p146.pdf,0,0,0

It was observed that the microwave heating accelerates their oxidation two or three times faster than conventional heating. This effect starts when the temperature of samples rises over 100 deg C. Below this temperature the rate of oxidation was relatively slow. In directed microwave heating. when the temperature of samples was kept below 100 deg C by breaking the heating. only slight oxidation was observed.

These attributes are mainly determined by olive oil chemical composition. which can be altered after thermal processing. oxidation processes. or incorrect practices. For this reason. and due to the numerous factors which have influence in olive oil quality. the correct chemical characterization is highly relevant. In this study. fatty acid composition of four extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) varieties was studied. The major fatty acid (FA) determined was oleic acid (77.1% on average). followed by palmitic (11.5% on average). In addition. thermal oxidation behaviour of the four EVOO samples was studied as an indicator of their quality and stability during thermal processing. This was performed through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) from a temperature of 40°C at six different heating rates in the range of 0.5–10°C min−1. DSC records showed the same pattern and a small shoulder in the thermo-oxidation peak was present for all samples and all heating rates.

The simplest aproach to their use in foods is to include oil or seeds directly in a food product. which enhances its resistance to oxidative rancidity. During oilseed processing. non− polar oil− soluble antioxidants pass into the edible oil and contribute to its higher oxidative stability. Such oils may be added directly to food products or blended with less stable ones to improve their stability. Semipolar antioxidants remain mainly in extracted meals. which can also be used to improve stability of food products. Application of some meals to food products is. however. not acceptable because of their detrimental effect on organoleptic properties of food products.

However. bacterial resistance to many of these drugs is becoming an increasing problem. As such. the discovery of drugs with novel modes of action will be vital to meet the threats created by the emergence of resistance.

Purification and characterization of the MurA and MurZ enzymes indicated that they are biochemically similar in vitro. consistent with similar overall structures predicted for the isozymes by molecular modelling. Nevertheless. MurA appears to be the primary enzyme utilized in the staphylococcal cell.

Using structural and functional analysis. we identified a binding pocket in the C-linker of HCN4. Cyclic dinucleotides. an emerging class of second messengers in mammals. bind the C-linker pocket (CLP) and antagonize cAMP regulation of the channel. Accordingly. cyclic dinucleotides prevent cAMP regulation of I f in sinoatrial node myocytes. reducing heart rate by 30%.

Additionally the failure of high throughput screening in the discovery of new antibacterial drug leads has led to a decline in the number of antibacterial agents reaching the market.

Here. we demonstrate that expansion of the alphabet of amino acids can also enable the properties of enzymes to be extended. A chemical mutagenesis strategy allowed a wide range of noncanonical amino acids to be systematically incorporated throughout an active site to alter enzymic substrate specificity. Specifically. 13 different noncanonical side chains were incorporated at 12 different positions within the active site of N-acetylneuraminic acid lyase (NAL). and the resulting chemically modified enzymes were screened for activity with a range of aldehyde substrates.

Our aim was to develop new strategies to modulate fibrinolysis in diabetes by interfering with fibrin–C3 interaction.To modulate interaction between fibrinogen and C3 we used a novel technique by screening fibrinogen with a phage display library of 3 billion random. conformational 9AA peptides (termed adhirons).

LLC,Previous studies have now well-established that epithelial cancer cells can utilize ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate and aceto-acetate) as mitochondrial fuels. to actively promote tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. The two critical metabolic enzymes implicated in this process are OXCT1 and ACAT1. which are both mitochondrial proteins. Importantly. over-expression of OXCT1 or ACAT1 in human breast cancer cells is sufficient to genetically drive tumorigenesis and/or lung metastasis. validating that they indeed behave as metabolic “tumor promoters”. Here. we decided to target these two enzymes. which give cancer cells the ability to recycle ketone bodies into Acetyl-CoA and. therefore. to produce increased ATP. Briefly. we used computational chemistry (in silico drug design) to select a sub-set of potentially promising compounds that spatially fit within the active site of these enzymes. based on their …,True,QBFlJmUAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,14,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5667966/,14918237141478324808,/scholar?cites=14918237141478324808,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5667966/,0,0,0

To rigorously determine whether flow does indeed have an advantage over batch. a broad range of synthetic photochemical transformations were optimized in both reactor modes and their yields and productivities compared. Surprisingly. yields were essentially identical in all comparative cases. Even more revealing was the observation that the productivity of flow reactors varied very little to that of their batch counterparts when the key reaction parameters were matched. Those with a single layer of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) had an average productivity 20 % lower than that of batch. whereas three‐layer reactors were 20 % more productive.

We anticipate that this methodology will inspire new retrosynthetic disconnections for substituted amine derivatives in organic synthesis. and particularly for challenging α‐tertiary primary amines.,True,dgNn-ekAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,11,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.202005294,372111639733526993,/scholar?cites=372111639733526993,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/anie.202005294,0,0,0

The impact of wavelength and light intensity on a photochemical reaction was evaluated within this platform using the Wohl‐Ziegler benzylic bromination of 4‐methyl‐3‐(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile with N‐bromosuccinimide as a model system. It was found that only 40 % of the maximum light intensity was required while still maintaining reaction rate. allowing more reliable temperature control and lower energy consumption.

Motivation to develop this technology stems from the ability of trickle bed reactors to perform hydrogenations at high pressures (up to 100 bar within GSK). which is considerably greater than our current hydrogenation batch vessels (5 bar). This allows access to chemistry with improved quality and productivity. with the added benefit of enhanced process control. reduced reactor size. reduced vessel cleaning time. greener processes. and increased safety.

A cubic FeII8L12 cage was obtained from a metalloligand with an intermediate aspect ratio. By increasing the length or by decreasing the width of the ligand. the self-assembly process resulted in the clean formation of tetrahedral FeII4L6 cages instead of cubic cages. In a related fashion. it was possible to control the geometry of PdII-based coordination cages.

The behaviour of these dimers is interpreted in terms of their bent shape being the predominant driving force for the formation of the twist-bend nematic phase. and the small differences between the twist-bend nematic–nematic transition temperatures are attributed to the differences between the interaction strength parameters of the mesogenic units.

However. the implementation of this strategy is hampered by the fact that the preparation of such ligands often requires substantial synthetic effort. Herein. we describe a simple one-step protocol. which allows large bipyridyl ligands with a bent shape to be synthesized from easily accessible and/or commercially available starting materials. The ligands were used to construct PdII2L4-type coordination cages of unprecedented size.

An important and necessary aspect of the calculations was the need to use different CASSCF active spaces for the different reaction paths on the investigated PESs. The CASSCF calculations focused on O2+C2H4 addition to form the C2H4O2 biradical on the triplet and singlet surfaces. and isomerization reaction paths ensuing from this biradical.

Recent studies have shown that nano-clay used to enhance the mechanical properties of polymers such as polyethylene also helps in polymer degradation (Lee et al.. 2005; Qin et al.. 2003). The present work aims to investigate the effect of montmorillonite nano-clay (MMT) on the photo-oxidation of polyethylene. The molecular weight changes of polyethylene in MMT/polyethylene nanocomposites upon UV irradiation were evaluated using rheological measurement and gel permeation chromatography. The molecular weight decrease for nanocomposites is found to be greater than that for the pure polyethylene. Furthermore. the increase in clay concentration also enhances the rate of photo-oxidation of the polymer. These results show that clay is acting as a self pro-oxidant during the photo-oxidation.

1208815,Extensional rheology of polypropylene in relation to processing characteristics,2004,I Ivanov and S Muke and N Kao and SN Bhattacharya,19,International Polymer Processing,1,40-46,De Gruyter,Transient extensional rheological behaviour of several polypropylene (PP) homo-and co-polymer grades was studied at different temperatures. In addition. shear rheological characterisation was completed. The structure of PP grades was characterised by using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hot-stage optical microscopy (HS-OM). It was found that the extensional viscosity of the polymers followed the three-fold transient shear viscosity curves when the tests were conducted in fully molten state. as expected for linear polymer melts. However. the strain hardening behaviour was evident when PP was stretched in the semi-molten state. ie below its melting temperature (Tm). Similar to results of a recent study by Rauschenberger. three temperature zones of different extensional behaviour were found: linear viscoelastic behaviour and uniform drawing in the molten state (180 C). unstable drawing just above Tm (170 C) and stable drawing with strong strain hardening below Tm (165 C). The strain hardening behaviour was quantified and related to molecular structure and morphology of PP. It was found that none of the investigated parameters alone was sufficient to predict the extensional behaviour of PP.

1208824,Determination of the Molecular Weight Distribution from the Rheological Data: Commercial PP Homo-and Co-polymers,,I Ivanov and S Muke and N Kao and SN Bhattacharya,,,,,,The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of polymers strongly influences their processing behaviour. The most common technique for determining the MWD of polymers is gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). which requires dissolution of polymers at high temperatures and is usually considered as time-consuming [1]. Since the MWD of a linear polymer can be uniquely correlated to the rheological properties. many studies have focused on determining the MWD information from rheology data [2]. It is well known that viscosity of a polymer melt in the Newtonian region (zero shear viscosity. η0) is proportional to weightaverage molecular weight (Mw). according to the following relation: η0= KMw α…(1)The value of α is≈ 3.4 for most polymer melts and molecular weights greater than critical (entanglement) molecular weight (Mw> Me). Since the introduction of “crossover modulus” technique by Zeichner and Patel in 1981 [3]. it has become possible to correlate the breadth of the measured MWD to a measured rheological parameter. such as the rheological polydispersity index. which is defined as,True,MpYEPDAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Ivanov113/publication/281427913_Determination_of_the_Molecular_Weight_Distribution_from_the_Rheological_Data_Commercial_PP_Homo-_and_Co-polymers/links/55e6896708aecb1a7ccd6c94/Determination-of-the-Molecular-Weight-Distribution-from-the-Rheological-Data-Commercial-PP-Homo-and-Co-polymers.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Ivanov113/publication/281427913_Determination_of_the_Molecular_Weight_Distribution_from_the_Rheological_Data_Commercial_PP_Homo-_and_Co-polymers/links/55e6896708aecb1a7ccd6c94/Determination-of-the-Molecular-Weight-Distribution-from-the-Rheological-Data-Commercial-PP-Homo-and-Co-polymers.pdf,0,0,0
1208825,Extensional Rheology and Crystallisation Behaviour of Polypropylene Nanocomposites,,Ivan Ivanov and Satinath N Bhattacharya,,,,,,Polypropylene (PP) melts are subjected to extensional deformation in many industrial processes. such as film-blowing. blow-moulding and thermoforming. To provide an appropriate level of melt strength. these processes are performed at temperatures near Tm of PP. where the remaining crystallinity plays a role in deformation response. A strong degree of strain-hardening can be obtained within a narrow processing window. Hence. additives that effect crystallinity of PP. such as nucleating agents or clarifiers can significantly influence its rheological behaviour and processability. In polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites (PLSNC). nano-particles not only act as reinforcing fillers. but also provide nucleating sites during crystallisation. Therefore. the rheological behaviour of semi-molten PP nanocomposites can be different from that observed in fully molten state. In this work. melting and crystallisation behaviour of PP/modified hectorite nanocomposites were studied by Modulated DSC and compared to both neat PP and nucleated PP. Extensional viscosity measurements were performed using the RME at various strain rates in the temperature range between 160-170 C. In addition. dynamic mechanical behaviour of studied systems in that temperature range was assessed by using ARES rheometer. The combination of techniques provided an insight into the complex behaviour of PP nanocomposites during processing. Based on the suggested measurements. one can make an estimate of the optimal processing conditions for the materials tested.,True,MpYEPDAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Ivanov113/publication/282121365_Extensional_Rheology_and_Crystallisation_Behaviour_of_Polypropylene_Nanocomposites/links/560367e208ae08d4f17164b3.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Ivanov113/publication/282121365_Extensional_Rheology_and_Crystallisation_Behaviour_of_Polypropylene_Nanocomposites/links/560367e208ae08d4f17164b3.pdf,0,0,0

The selectivity involved in this method is based on the differences in electrochemical behavior of catechol and ascorbic acid. A variety of dual-band Pt. Au. glassy carbon. and P3MT electrodes were constructed and used as the electrochemical detector. The upstream electrode of the series dual-band electrode unit is used for detection of catechol and ascorbic acid and the downstream electrode for detection of the oxidized catechol. The band dimensions range from 0.1×2.5 to 1×5.5 mm with the interelectrode gaps varying from 0.1 to 0.5 mm.

Past work with this polymer electrode suggested the possible presence of “active sites.” which are believed to be the polymer’s center of electrocatalytic activity. The interaction of 1.5-anthroquinone-disolfonic acid (1.5-AQDS) at the P3MT electrode showed a nonreversible behavior resulting in the blocking of “the active sites.” suggesting the specific electcatalytical activity of this polymer is limited to catechol and similar compounds. In order to improve catecholamine detection. two methods of electropolymerization for P3MT were compared under similar conditions; (1) a constant potential for a specific length of time. and (2) potential cycling.

Dry nitrogen was introduced into the plasma through the central gas (carrier gas) inlet at a flow rate of 0.5 dm3 min–1. A pyrolytic graphite probe with a melting-point of 3900 K was positioned 15 mm above the load coil in the centre of the plasma.

Based on recently published structures of PAMO and its mutants. we selected previously uncharacterised positions as well as known hot-spots to be targeted by focused mutagenesis. We were able to mutate 11 positions in a single step by using the OmniChange method for the mutant library generation. Screening of the library using a phosphate-based activity detection method allowed identification of a quadruple mutant (P253F/G254A/R258M/L443F) active on cyclopentanone.

Synthetic substrates are essential in testing newborns for metabolic disorders to enable early initiation of therapy. Our click-flipped iduronyl triazole showed a remarkably better performance with I2S than commonly used O-iduronates. We found that both O- and triazole-linked substrates are accepted by the enzyme. irrespective of their different conformations. but only the O-linked product inhibits the activity of I2S. Thus. in the long reaction times required for clinical assays. the triazole substrate substantially outperforms the O-iduronate.

The use of micellar solutions of low molecular weight surfactants has been one of the popular methods for the solubilization of hydrophobic drugs; however. such surfactants suffer from high critical micelle concentration and concomitant low stabilities. In contrast to surfactants of low molecular masses. polymeric micelles are associated with general advantages like higher stability. tailorability. greater cargo capacity. non-toxicity and controlled drug release. Therefore. the current review article is focused on the engineering of the core of polymeric micelles for maximum therapeutic effect.

Known cellular responses to combustion particles include oxidative stress and inflammatory signalling.   Objectives To provide a molecular link between the chemical and physical characteristics of ship emission particles and the cellular responses they elicit and to identify potentially harmful fractions in shipping emission aerosols.   Methods Through an air-liquid interface exposure system. we exposed human lung cells under realistic in vitro conditions to exhaust fumes from a ship engine running on either common heavy fuel oil (HFO) or cleaner-burning diesel fuel (DF). Advanced chemical analyses of the exhaust aerosols were combined with transcriptional. proteomic and metabolomic profiling including isotope labelling methods to characterise the lung cell responses.   Results The HFO emissions contained high concentrations of toxic compounds such as metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. and were higher in particle mass. These compounds were lower in DF emissions. which in turn had higher concentrations of elemental carbon (“soot”). Common cellular reactions included cellular stress responses and endocytosis.

For evaluation and optimization. PAH standard mixtures introduced by gas chromatography were used. Atmospheric 25 pressure laser ionization (APLI) approaches with laser wavelengths above 200 nm induce a multiphoton process. and ionization yields are strongly dependent on the heteroatom-content and isomeric structure. The presented technique using VUV photons allowed for the selective ionization of semi-to non-polar compounds in a single photon ionization process. Consequently. molecular radical cations were found as base peak. whereas protonated species were almost absent. Even though the 30 ionization chamber is flushed by a high flow of pure nitrogen. remaining oxygen and water traces caused several side-reactions. leading to unwanted oxidized ionization artifacts. Installation of a water and oxygen filter cartridge significantly reduced the abundance of those artifacts. whereas the laser beam position was found to have a substantially lower effect. For evaluating complex mixture analysis. APSPLI was applied to characterize a light crude oil subjected to the ionization source by 35 thermogravimetry and gas chromatography hyphenation. In addition to aromatic hydrocarbons. APSPLI also allowed for the sensitive ionization of sulfur-containing aromatic constituents. and even species with two sulfur-atoms could be detected. A comparison of APSPLI to APLI conducted at 266 nm revealed the additional compositional space accessible by the single …,True,91bBwokAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,0,https://chemrxiv.org/ndownloader/files/25452491,,,,https://chemrxiv.org/ndownloader/files/25452491,0,0,0

This fraction is related to diverse problems in crude oil exploration. transportation. and refining. Two asphaltene architecture motifs are commonly discussed in the literature. “island” (single-core)- and “archipelago” (multicore)-type structures. The thermal desorption and pyrolysis behavior of island- and archipelago-enriched asphaltenes and their extrography fractions was investigated. For this purpose. the evolved chemical pattern was investigated by thermal analysis coupled with ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS)).

This is the first observation of relatively large molecules in this source. Most of the observed bands in both toluene (1 B 2→ 1 A 1) and the benzyl radical (2 A 2→ 2 B 2) are the result of emission from the lowest vibrational level in the electronic excited state. The toluene vibronic assignments were based on the known infrared and Raman vibrational frequencies. while the benzyl radical assignments were based on comparison with the toluene frequencies and previous benzyl radical studies. The absence of significant hot band emission from the excited electronic states in both toluene and benzyl suggests extensive vibrational cooling in the corona excited supersonic expansion source.

1208975,EXCITED STATE DYNAMICS AND SPECTROSCOPY OF AZABENZENES (PYRIDINE. PYRIDAZINE. TRANSIENT SPECIES),1984,JODYE ISABEL SELCO,,,,,,Relaxation processes in pyridine and pyridazine have been investigated using time resolved spectroscopic methods. In order to investigate the photophysics and dynamics of molecular excited states a versatile transient absorption spectrophotometer has been designed and constructed to study low pressure gas phase samples on the nanosecond time scale. The sensitivity of this apparatus is high enough to allow investigation of samples with a (DELTA)(epsilon)p > 0.05 M('-1)cm('-1)Torr('-1). and has an rms noise level of (TURN)0.0002 absolute absorbance units. With this spectrophotometer a T(.n)()T(.1) intersystem crossing. and has an estimated oscillator strength of (TURN)0.02. An internal calibration method has enabled reliable excited state extinction coefficients to be evaluated. The intersystem crossing process in pyridine has been shown to be in or very near the statistical limit. Pressure-dependent and nonexponential nonradiative decay is exhibited by triplet pyridine. These two forms have intrinsic lifetimes of > 10 (mu)s and 200 ns. A weak complex is found to be formed between triplet pyridine and oxygen in the quenching process. Gas phase ground state repopulation experiments show that S(.o) pyridine is the resulting state of this quenching process. Total repopulation of vapor phase pyridine has also been observed in the presence of 10 Torr cyclohexane and 100 Torr O(.2) on the (mu)s time scale. A 4% (+OR-)2% photochemical yield has been calculated for pyridazine following excitation to the S(.1) state.

They work as antioxidant against the biological. chemical and mechanical stress on plants. The substance that removes potentially damaged oxidizing agents in a living organism is regarded as antioxidant. Lignin contains a huge amount of phenolic constructions that enable it to act as an effectual antioxidant. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) observed decreases in some oxidative aging products and maintained the idea that lignin play role as an effective antioxidant. It was discovered that antioxidant action of lignin varies with the molecular characteristics. isolation method and genetic origin.

Inc.,Despite the extensive search for glycine (NH2CH2COOH) and other amino acids in molecular clouds associated with star-forming regions. only upper limits have been derived from radio observations. Nevertheless. two of glycine's precursors. formic acid and acetic acid. have been abundantly detected. Although both precursors may lead to glycine formation. the efficiency of reaction depends on their abundance and survival in the presence of a radiation field. These facts could promote some favoritism in the reaction pathways in the gas phase and solid phase (ice). Glycine and these two simplest carboxylic acids are found in many meteorites. Recently. glycine was also observed in cometary samples returned by the Stardust space probe.The goal of this work was to perform theoretical calculations for several interstellar reactions involving the simplest carboxylic acids as well as the carboxyl radical (COOH) in …,True,fK-Kt4gAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,29,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2011.0650,15686197673622998466,/scholar?cites=15686197673622998466,,,0,0,0

When ice is recrystallized by heating. the surface layers retain some disorder. which promote reactions among adsorbed molecules such as H2O. CO2. CH2CO. HCOOH and theirs radiolysis products. In this work. chemical reactions involving formic acid condensed at 56 K are analyzed by using Plasma Desorption Mass Spectrometry-time-of-flight (252Cf-PDMS-TOF).

Methanol has been detected in gas and condensed phases in several astrophysical environments. such as comets. asteroids. toward star forming regions and molecular clouds. In some of these environments. methanol is the most abundant specie after water ice. The interaction of ionizing agents with methanol ice induces the production of ionized species. leading to the formation of new compounds. In this work. pure methanol ice (at 142 K) was irradiated. in ultra-high vacuum regime. with 800 eV electrons. thus simulating the wind in frozen surfaces.

The sensors are also highly selective because of the ligand–shell organization of the NPs.

GAMESS uses ab initio and semi-empirical calculations to determine these properties. Ab initio (“from first principles”) calculations solve the Schrödinger equation using the exact computational expression for the energy of the electrons. 1 The particular ab initio method that we will use for this lab is called Hartree-Fock (HF). HF uses an approximate wavefunction to solve Schrödinger. so the resulting molecular properties are approximate. but for many applications the accuracy is adequate for interpreting experiments. Semi-empirical calculations use an approximate energy expression for the electrons. but solve for the exact wavefunction associated with this expression. Usually the energy expression uses empirical parameters (found experimentally) to match molecular properties. but the resulting properties are still approximations to the correct values. The semi-empirical method that we used in this lab is called PM3. This stands for “parameterized model 3”. which was the third (and best) method that the original authors of the method developed.The underlying theory for GAMESS will be described in the lecture. In brief. GAMESS self-consistently solves the Schrödinger equation. The self-consistent method is an iterative approach that minimizes the energy by adjusting the wave functions of the molecules.

To expand its applications we have developed a versatile FSRS setup in the ultraviolet region. We use the combination of a narrowband.~ 400 nm Raman pump from a home-built second harmonic bandwidth compressor and a tunable broadband probe pulse from sum-frequency-generation-based cascaded four-wave mixing (SFG-CFWM) laser sidebands in a thin BBO crystal. The ground state Raman spectrum of a laser dye Quinolon 390 in methanol that strongly absorbs at~ 355 nm is systematically studied as a standard sample to provide previously unavailable spectroscopic characterization in the vibrational domain. Both the Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman spectra can be collected by selecting different orders of SFG-CFWM sidebands as the probe pulse. The stimulated Raman gain with the 402 nm Raman pump is> 21 times larger than that with the 550 nm Raman pump when measured at the 1317 cm− 1 peak for the aromatic ring deformation and ring-H rocking mode of the dye molecule. demonstrating that pre-resonance enhancement is effectively achieved in the unique UV-FSRS setup.

This paper describes the extraction and purification of the lectin found in tubers of the winter aconite (Eranthis hyemalis). with the aim of improving and modernising the existing extraction protocol. The Eranthis hyemalis lectin (EHL) is a member of the type-2 Ribosome Inactivating Proteins (RIP) family. proteins which have the ability to inhibit in vitro protein synthesis. RIPs have been linked to plant defence by their antiviral. antifungal and insecticidal properties. and some have been found to be potent inhibitors of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) virus. EHL was purified using affinity column chromatography and ammonium sulphate precipitation; thiourea was used as antioxidant in order to prevent EHL denaturing during the extraction process.

Here we present a modified protocol for the extraction and purification of the E. hyemalis lectin (EHL) using affinity chromatography. De novo amino acid sequencing of EHL confirms its classification as a Type II Ribosome Inactivating Protein. The biocidal properties of EHL have been investigated against the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Arrested first stage larvae treated with EHL have shown some direct mortality. with surviving larvae subsequently showing a range of phenotypes including food avoidance. reduced fecundity. developmental delay and constitutive dauer larvae formation. Both inappropriate dauer larvae development and failure to locate to bacterial food source are consistent with the disruption of chemosensory function and the ablation of amphid neurons. Further investigation indicates that mutations that disrupt normal amphid formation can block the EHL-induced dauer larvae formation. In combination. these phenotypes indicate that EHL is cytotoxic and suggest a cell specific activity against the amphid neurons of C. elegans.,True,Plkwp2UAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,4,https://peerj.com/articles/1206/,9153572709794086574,/scholar?cites=9153572709794086574,,https://peerj.com/articles/1206/,0,0,0

Of particular importance to understanding the physics of this system is how the bandgap energy Eg and spin-orbit splitting energy Δo vary relative to one another as a function of Bi content. since in this alloy it becomes possible for Δo to exceed Eg for higher Bi fractions. which occurrence would have important implications for minimising non-radiative Auger recombination losses in such structures.

In addition. the large size of Bismuth atoms gives rise to a large spin-orbit splitting. This opens-up interesting new possibilities for efficient photonic devices. such as near- and mid-infrared lasers which are more thermally stable and less susceptible to losses compared to conventional InP-based devices.

1209153,Characterisation of Compound Semiconductors for Next Generation Photonic Devices,2014,Zahida Batool,,,,,,This thesis focuses on exploring novel IIl-V bismide alloys due to their potential of engineering the band structure in such a way that the spin-orbit splitting energy is greater than the band gap [Aso> Eg) which helps to suppress important non-radiative Auger recombination losses. These losses reduce the efficiency of near-lR telecommunication lasers (1.55 pm) as well as limit the performance of mid-lR light emitting devices. A number of optical characterisation techniques have been applied to study the detailed band structure of bismide alloys to provide feedback for band structure modelling and growth optimisation.PR studies on the GaBixAsi-x/GaAs material system with up to 10.4% Bi. showed a strong Eg reduction accompanied by an increase in Aso with increasing Bi content. with a cross-over of Eg and Aso at Bi~ 9.4.±0.2%.

1209154,Photomodulated Reflectance Spectroscopy of GaAsBi/GaAs layers grown by MBE,,Zahida Batool and Jeff Hosea and Stephen J Sweeney and Tom Tiedje,,,,,,The III-bismides are considered to be a very attractive set of III-V alloys due to their potential applications in photonic and spintronic devices. The incorporation of bismuth into GaAs. with its band anti-crossing effect in the valence band of GaAs. leads to a decrease in the temperature dependence of the bandgap. Such a material may be very useful in designing temperature-insensitive semiconductor lasers. optical amplifiers and optical modulators in the near-and mid-IR region [1]. As bismuth is a comparatively large atom. its alloying to III-V semiconductors can possibly lead to a large spin orbit splitting needed for spintronic devices [2]. This property is also expected to significantly increase the operating efficiency of near-IR lasers by suppressing Auger recombination and inter-valence band absorption [3].In order to investigate the basic physical properties of this new alloy. spectroscopic measurements were …,True,rM5YNhIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,http://www.umich.edu/~mctp/SciPrgPgs/events/2011/BCS/talk%20files/Abstract%20files/Batool.doc,,,,,0,0,0

Irradiations of designed nitrogen branched (trimethylsilyl) methylthio-terminated polyethylenoxy-tethered naphthalimides in acidic methanol solutions have led to highly efficient photocyclization reactions to generate naphthalamide based lariat type thiadiazacrown ethers directly in chemo-and regio-selective manners which undergo very facile secondary dehydration reactions during separation processes to produce their corresponding amidoenethio ether cyclic products tethered with electron donating diethyleneoxy-and diethyenethio-side arm chains. Fluorescence and metal cation binding properties of the lariat type enamidothio products were examined. The photocyclized amidoenethio products. thioene conjugated naphthalamide fluorophore containing lariat-thiadiazacrowns exhibited strong fluorescence emissions in region of 330-450 nm along with intramolecular exciplex emissions in region of 450-560 nm with their maxima at 508 nm. Divalent cation  and  showed strong binding to sulfur atom (s) in side arm chain and atoms in enethiadiazacrown ether rings which led to significant enhancement of fluorescence from its chromophore singlet excited state and concomitant quenching of exciplex emission.

We show here that cobalt(II) catalysts supported by bulky β-diketiminate ligands have the appropriate kinetic selectivity to catalyze the isomerization of some simple 1-alkenes specifically to the 2-alkene as the less stable Z-isomer. The catalysis proceeds via an “alkyl” mechanism. with a three-coordinate cobalt(II) alkyl complex as the resting state. β-Hydride elimination and [1.2]-insertion steps are both rapid. as shown by isotopic labeling experiments. A steric model explains the selectivity through a square-planar geometry at cobalt(II) in the transition state for β-hydride elimination.

Sheehan,8,Coatings,7,246,MDPI,The oxidation of water to form oxygen gas provides charge balance for the cathodic deposition of metals. such as zinc. in the electrorefining industry. This is a corrosive. four-electron electrochemical reaction that causes deterioration of lead-silver alloy anodes employed in these processes. A sacrificial manganese oxide layer on the anode surface. formed in-situ from manganese sulfate. is used in industry to reduce the corrosion rate of these anodes by preferentially enabling water oxidation rather than lead dissolution. Still. it is poorly understood how the activity of manganese oxide as a water oxidation catalyst relates to its anticorrosive properties. Here. we show how the presence of water oxidation catalysts both formed in-situ (including the industry standard manganese oxide) and heterogenized prior to electrolysis on lead anodes affect the corrosion potential of these anodes. We find that corrosion potential under dynamic polarization conditions is the parameter most affected by the coatings formed in-situ and applied ex-situ prior to electrolysis.

1209228,Alcohol Production from Carbon Dioxide: Methanol as a Fuel and Chemical Feedstock,2020,Seda Sarp and Santiago Gonzalez Hernandez and Chi Chen and Stafford W Sheehan,,,,,Cell Press,Production of renewable alcohols from air. water. and sunlight present an avenue to utilize captured carbon dioxide for the production of basic chemicals and store renewable energy in the chemical bonds of liquid fuels. Of the technologies that utilize CO2 directly. CO2 electrolysis. as well as CO2 hydrogenation coupled with H2O electrolysis. have the benefit of requiring only CO2. H2O. and renewable electricity as inputs with O2 as a sole byproduct. Among alcohols. renewable methanol has seen the most development and analysis in the chemical industry because it is currently a syngas-derived product that could be adapted for direct CO2 utilization. In this perspective. we compare renewably powered CO2 electrolysis and CO2 hydrogenation with the incumbent methanol production method from syngas from a cost and CO2 life cycle perspective by analyzing recent literature to identify the research goals that …,True,kmRJJ4UAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435120305134,5173292599837472400,/scholar?cites=5173292599837472400,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stafford_Sheehan/publication/347313981_Alcohol_Production_from_Carbon_Dioxide_Methanol_as_a_Fuel_and_Chemical_Feedstock/links/600f1fe9299bf14088c06aeb/Alcohol-Production-from-Carbon-Dioxide-Methanol-as-a-Fuel-and-Chemical-Feedstock.pdf,0,0,0

Gibbs energy of activation ΔG∗= 26 kJ mol− 1. pre-exponential factor A≈ 10 1 cm s− 1 and transfer coefficient α= 0.31.

and can further be reduced by a factor of 2 at the most. • Still the lowest resistance values are
important since they imply high efficiency (hence. low heat generation and improved safety) and
low RC-constant (hence. grid frequency regulation). • Higher operating temperature (about 100
°C) and higher rated voltage (about 3 V) are good challenges. and they are in Yunasko R&D
portfolio today. Since the SC energy density is limited by 5-8 Wh/kg. hybrid devices can become
a good choice when the larger energy density is critical while a shorter cycle life can be accepted

Traditionally. propranolol has been extracted using sonication. but this has proved to be significantly solvent consuming. In this study. propranolol has been extracted successfully from tablets using an optimised microwave-assisted solvent extraction (MASE) method. The optimum conditions for MASE for this application were: extraction solvent. methanol; extraction time. 45 s (5 s heat and 40 s cool); and extraction solvent volume. 5.00 mL.

Its first observation reported by Smalley et al. in 1992 suggests that C28 is potentially the smallest and most stable fullerene ever observed. By using the Krätschmer−Huffman arc discharge synthesis method. we have recently succeeded in synthesizing a series of uranium‐endohedral fullerenes which differ from those reported by Smalley and co‐workers. Intrigued by this interesting mismatch. we tuned our experimental conditions to favor the formation and detection of these missing species.

The density of the material is often governed by its cellular (i.e.. porous) structure. and many techniques exist to create that structure. Often. the cellular structure can vary from one location within the material to another. and when at low densities (i.e.. densities lower than ~500 mg/cm3). it can vary due to shrinkage during syneresis. collapse under the weight of gravity. or gas/water vapor uptake. Quantifying this variation is important for a variety of applications. especially when used in plasma physics targets.

Consistent with the scheme. we experimentally demonstrate aluminum and carbon ion beams with narrow spectral peaks at energies up to 310 MeV (11.5 MeV/nucleon) and 220 MeV (18.3 MeV/nucleon). respectively. with high conversion efficiency (~ 5%. ie. 4J out of 80J laser). This is achieved with 0.12 PW high-contrast Gaussian laser pulses irradiating planar foils with optimal thicknesses of up to 250 nm that scale with laser intensity. When increasing the focused laser intensity fourfold (by reducing the focusing optic f/number twofold). the spectral-peak energy increases twofold. These results pave the way for next generation compact accelerators suitable for applications.

It is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils. Granitile contains up to 80 ppm of thorium. Thorium occurs naturally as the minerals thorite. uranothorite. and thorianite. It is a major component of monazite and it is present in significant amounts in the minerals zircon. titanite. gadolinite and betafite. The amounts of thorium in the environment may be incidentally increased due to accidental releases of thorium processing plants. Uncontrolled large amounts of thorium may be found near hazardous waste sites where thorium has not been disposed of according to the proper procedures. People living near these sites may get exposed to more thorium as they breathe in windblown dust and because it ends up in food that is grown near the site. Since thorium has the ability to change genetic arrangements. it may increase the chances of developing the lung diseases and pancreas cancer. 1 Therefore. more efforts are required to develop ion-selective electrodes of commercial standards for heavy metal ions that are toxic beyond a certain concentration level. 2A literature survey showed that only three-potentiometric electrodes are available for detecting and/or measuring and monitoring thorium in environmental media. 3–5 The present work describes the working of a sensor involving a dithio-tetraaza macrocyclic compound. namely 2. 3. 7. 8-tetraphenyl-1. 4. 6. 9-tetraaza-cyclodeca-5. 10-dithion-1. 3. 6. 8-tetraene (TPTACDTT) as ionophore. 3% sodium tetraphenyl borate (NaTPB) as an additive and 62 …,True,AP9NEAkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,40,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/analsci/23/4/23_4_469/_article/-char/ja/,14425788300877234531,/scholar?cites=14425788300877234531,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/analsci/23/4/23_4_469/_pdf,0,0,0

Les travailleurs œuvrant dans le domaine de la santé tel que les pompiers et ambulanciers. aussi bien que ceux dans le domaine de transformation des métaux. requièrent le port de VIP à un certain moment de leur travail. Toutefois. ces vêtements individuels de protection nuisent au processus d'échange thermique qui se produit normalement entre le corps et son environnement en créant un microclimat à l'intérieur de l'habit. Ce microclimat se sature rapidement de vapeur d'eau et empêche fortement les pertes de chaleur par évaporation. De plus. les matériaux utilisés dans la fabrication des VIP ont souvent le désavantage d'être lourds et de manquer de souplesse.Dans le cas des pompiers. les contraintes thermiques qu'entraîne le port de ces VIP sont jumelées aux contraintes thermiques environnementales ainsi qu'à des exigences physiques importantes. Effectivement. il est démontré que le travail de pompier est exigeant pour le système cardio-respiratoire puisqu'il requiert des efforts physiques importants effectués avec un équipement relativement lourd (ex: l'appareil respiratoire autonome). Ceci entraîne une augmentation de la demande physiologique et expose les travailleurs à de hauts risques d'accident cardiovasculaire.

However. the possibility of using electrical principle for the designing of new generation of biomaterials has been largely overlooked. Recently. electrically conductive polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) have revealed the ability to support the in vitro growth of cells like endothelium and nerve cells. It has also been shown that by controlling the electrical potential applied across the conductive surface. the shape and secretion of the cells cultured on such a substrate can be modulated. These findings suggest that there is a great potential for using electrically conductive polymers as biomaterials. However. there have been no systematic studies with respect to PPy as a biomaterial.

Both spectroscopic probes gave proofs on the interaction of the two proteins. At pH 4.0. 7.0 and 9.0. BSA showed a negative increase in ellipticity at the far-UV range in the presence of MT indicating an increase in α-helical content and a decrease in β-sheet structure. In the presence of MT at pH 4.0 and 9.0. a decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments were also performed using acrylamide and KI as quenchers. Under acidic conditions. a four-fold increase in Stern-Volmer constant (KSV) was observed for BSA+ MT. At neutral and basic conditions. a decrease in KSV values were observed which indicates conformational changes in BSA upon binding MT.

Once the polymers have fulfilled the function for which they have been manufactured. they are disposed of in landills in large amounts each year. which is incompatible with current environmental goals. The disposal of polymer based plastics such as incineration and landfill results in environmental pollution and land occupation. These current levels of polymer disposal are not sustainable and polymer recycling. which is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce the negative impacts. receives increasing attention. Recycling provides opportunities to reduce oil usage. carbon dioxide emissions and the quantities of polymer wastes. as well as the negative impacts of disposal. Using recycled polymer wastes to replace virgin materials in some applications. such as non-food packaging and automotive components. can effectively decrease the demand of the amount of import oil and conserve raw materials. Further it can also lead to the energy saving and creating new jobs. Considering all the positive impacts of polymer recycling on environment. economy and society. considerable attention is being given to recover materials from polymer wastes.

Fourier transform infrared spectral results indicate an increasing trend of benzenoid to quinoid ratio with the decrease of interaction of the solvents with aniline. This can be correlated to the increase in the degree of conjugation of the polymer chain. Photoluminescence study revealed an increase in the density of defect state with the decrease of interaction. Single‐line approximation technique was used to analyze the broadening of the most intense X‐ray reflection peak corresponding to (110) plane of the nanofibers.

This detection system based on the measurement of mass change corresponding to a frequency shift of the modified quartz crystal relies on the high dissociating capability of HCl in aqueous medium resulting in fast and efficient protonation of PAni and the rapid insertion of Cl− counterions to maintain charge neutrality. This results in a highly sensitive and selective HCl sensor over several common mineral acids. salts. and anions.

Dynamic processes occurring at different frequencies in PAni nanofibers exhibit the same activation energy which reveals an enhanced coupling among the localized short range dipolar motions.

Many interesting aspects of SHI interactions with conducting PAni nanofibers and PAni nanofiber reinforced gel polymer electrolytes are revealed. Electron microscopy has been used for explaining the variations in physico-chemical properties viz.. crystallinity. phaseseparation. electronic and ionic conductivity. porosity and morphology of these materials upon SHI irradiation. HCl and CSA doped PAni nanofibers and de-doped nanofiber reinforced P (VdF− HFP) based gel polymer electrolytes have been irradiated with 90 MeV O7+ ions at different fluences. SHI irradiation causes fragmentation of the PAni nanofibers with increasing fluence as observed by transmission electron microscopy. XRD and micro-Raman (μR) studies reveal amorphization of the PAni nanofibers which is corroborated by the TEM results. μR studies also reveal a benzenoid to quinoid transformation in the PAni nanofiber backbone chain. In the case of P (VdF− HFP) based gel polymer electrolytes it has been observed that upon SHI irradiation the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte films increases at lower fluences (≤ 1011 ions/cm2). whereas a decreasing trend in conductivity is observed at higher fluences (≥ 1011 ions/cm2) as compared to the unirradiated film. Maximum ambient ionic conductivity of 1.2× 10− 2 S/cm has been achieved after irradiation with a fluence of 1011 ions/cm2.

The major pollutants from the industrial complexes are effluents with heavy metals. Chromium is a highly toxic element and major pollutant present in the environment. Chromium (III) and (VI) are mainly found in chrome plating. dyes and pigments. leather tanning. and wood preserving. Chromium (VI) is mobile and easily soluble into cells of an organism. There are many methods like ion exchange. ultra filtration. reverse osmosis etc by which chromium (VI) can be removed but they are quiet expensive and have many other disadvantages. In our present study. natural products considered to be wastes were used as adsorbents because of its high availability and low-cost. Low cost adsorbent used was Green coconut shell in a processed form in order to compare the efficiency. This study. reports the efficiency of low cost biosorbents in remediation of chromium (VI). It is seen that the biosorbents. green coconut shell has showed high biosorption capacity as it reduced 50% of 100mg/L concentration of chromium in a span of 24 hrs. The obtained results showed that incubation time and size of adsorbent affected the uptake capacity of biosorbent. As the time increased the percentage of adsorption increased till 264 hours. Smaller the size more efficient is the adsorption capacity.

The past decades there has been a substantial increase in the understanding of the molecular chemistry that leads to high selectivity catalysis. Especially the discovery of an oxometallacycle intermediate that produces ethylene epoxide in competition with acetaldehyde can be considered a major advancement. The state of the surface at reaction conditions causes different reaction paths to compete. At high oxygen coverage also a direct epoxidation channel opens.

Furthermore. more recent studies carried out on so called trilayer silver oxide surfaces with Ag1. 83O or Ag2O stochiometries [3. 4] also supported the idea of EO formation from OME intermediate. Although the idea of using a catalyst with high oxygen concentration was offered and supported during the late 80’s [5-7] there has not been any research study encountered in the common literature considering highly oxidized Ag surfaces except for the works of surface oxides mentioned above. Recent surface science studies [8] have indicated diffusion of oxygen into the silver layers. thereby showing the existence of sub-surface oxygen or oxygen layers. In this work. AgO and Ag2O slab surfaces are investigated for ethylene epoxidation and compared with silver surface with low oxygen coverage.,True,1n-aWAYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,http://www.nacatsoc.org/21nam/data/papers/Paper1763.pdf,,,,http://www.nacatsoc.org/21nam/data/papers/Paper1763.pdf,0,0,0

The structure of β-caryophyllene was confirmed using FT-IR. NMR and MS. The antimicrobial effect of β-caryophyllene was examined using human pathogenic bacterial and fungal strains. Its anti-oxidant properties were evaluated by DPPH and FRAP scavenging assays. The cytotoxicity of β-caryophyllene was tested against seven human cancer cell lines. The corresponding selectivity index was determined by testing its cytotoxicity on normal cells. The effects of β-caryophyllene were studied on a series of in vitro antitumor-promoting assays using colon cancer cells. Results showed that β-caryophyllene demonstrated selective antibacterial activity against S. aureus (MIC 3±1.0 µM) and more pronounced anti-fungal activity than kanamycin. β-Caryophyllene also displayed strong antioxidant effects. Additionally. β-caryophyllene exhibited selective anti-proliferative effects against colorectal cancer cells (IC 50 19 µM). The results also showed that β-caryophyllene induces apoptosis via nuclear condensation and fragmentation pathways including disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Further. β-caryophyllene demonstrated potent inhibition against clonogenicity. migration. invasion and spheroid formation in colon cancer cells. These results prompt us to state that β-caryophyllene is the active principle responsible for the selective anticancer and antimicrobial activities of A. crassnia. β-Caryophyllene has great potential to be further developed as a promising chemotherapeutic agent against colorectal malignancies.

1209710,A Theoretical Study of Nitric Oxide Reduction in Heme-Copper Oxidase and Nitric Oxide Reductase,,L Mattias Blomberg and Margareta RA Blomberg and Per EM Siegbahn,,,,,,Cytochrome oxidase and the bacterial nitric oxide reductase (NOR) both belong to the heme-copper oxidase superfamily of enzymes. The two enzymes are proposed to have similar structures and are believed to share a common phylogeny. The binuclear center consists of a heme iron and a second metal ion. which is Cu in the oxidases and a non-heme Fe in NOR. The similarity in the structural features of the binuclear centers suggests that the two enzymes can reduce the same substrates. and indeed several cytochrome oxidases have been shown to display nitric oxide reductase activity and one bacterial NOR has been shown to reduce O2. The reduction of two NO to N2O and H2O in a ba3 type heme-copper oxidase has been investigated using density functional theory (B3LYP). The first NO binds to the ferrous heme iron. which slightly reduces NO to a more nitroxyl anion character. In this way nitric oxide is activated toward the reaction with the second NO. A five-membered ring is formed with the two oxygens coordinating to CuB whereas the binuclear center is oxidized to Fe (III) and CuB (II). A proton has to enter the catalytic cycle at this stage to break the NO bond forming CuB (II)-OH and Fe (III)-N2O in a rate limiting step.The structure of NOR is not solved but by using the structural similarities with the cytochrome oxidases qualified guesses of the coordination of the binuclear center can be made. Two models of the binuclear active site of NOR have been used to investigate the coordination of the non-heme iron (FeB).

The studies up to date have focused on building supramolecular hierarchies. ie. optimizing the polymer–azobenzene noncovalent interaction for efficient surface patterning. They have been conducted using systems with relatively low azobenzene content. and little is known about the concentration dependence of SRG formation in halogen-bonded polymer–azobenzene complexes.

We cover a broad concentration range. starting from 10 mol% azobenzene content and going all the way up to equimolar degree of complexation. The complexes are studied as spin-coated thin films. and analyzed by optical microscopy. atomic force microscopy. and optical diffraction arising during the SRG formation. We obtained diffraction efficiencies as high as 35%. and modulation depths close to 400 nm. which are significantly higher than the values previously reported for halogen-bonded polymer–azobenzene complexes.

1209740,LIQUID CRYSTALLINE NANOCOMPOSITES: FROM ACHIRAL TO CHIRAL SYSTEMS,2017,Karla Guadalupe Gutierrez Cuevas,,,,,,Liquid crystalline nanocomposites combine the fascinating shape-. size-. and composition-dependent properties of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) with the unique characteristics of liquid crystals (LCs) such as order. fluidity. and stimulusresponsiveness in a single system. This dissertation explores the design. synthesis. and characterization of new mesogen-functionalized NPs. their dispersion in distinct achiral and chiral LC hosts. and the study of their properties. Here. we first focus on the synthesis and characterization of hybrid gold nanoparticles and gold nanorods (GNRs) using a wet-chemistry approach. and their dispersion in achiral nematic LCs. Then. we modify our method to tailor the aspect ratio of GNRs and study their response to nearinfrared (NIR) light in chiral LC systems. We fabricated chiral LC nanocomposites capable of undergoing handedness-inversion and red. green. and blue (RGB) reflection tuning by NIR stimulus. We demonstrate that a blue phase LC nanocomposite could attain structural-transformation of the cubic structures upon NIR exposure. This dissertation also describes a novel pathway for the synthesis of hybrid silica nanoparticles and their dispersion in a dual frequency LC mixture. The resulting nanocomposite systems were able to self-organize into a helical configuration and exhibit three different states: homeotropic (transparent). focal conic (scattered). and planar (semi-transparent) under different frequencies at sustained low voltage. The nanoparticle-embedded system displays a significantly enhanced contrast ratio.

For this reason. facile synthetic procedures are desired that will lead to large quantities of uniformly sized metal NPs exhibiting specific shapes. Here. we report a general approach to the large-scale synthesis of noble metal nanocrystals having well-defined shapes and a narrow size distribution. This method utilizes seed-mediated NP growth in aqueous suspensions of cationic surfactants and metal salts. It leads to a ∼60-fold increase in NP volumetric production capacity. compared to the most widely used solution-based synthetic methods.

1209806,A Miniaturized Impedimetric Immunosensor for the Competitive Detection of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone,2017,Nan Li and Egor M Larin and Kagan Kerman,17,Sensors,12,2836,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) plays an essential role in regulating corticosteroid hormone production. which has important functions in a myriad of critical physiological functions. In this proof-of-concept study. a miniaturized immunosensor was developed for the highly sensitive detection of ACTH using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in connection with disposable screen-printed gold electrodes (SPGEs). A film of 3. 3′-dithiobis [sulfosuccinimidylpropionate](DTSSP) was prepared to immobilize anti-ACTH antibodies covalently on the nanostructured SPGE surface. The surface-immobilized anti-ACTH antibodies captured the biotinylated ACTH (biotin-ACTH) and non-labelled ACTH for the competitive immunoassay. After coupling of a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Streptavidin-ALP). the bio-catalysed precipitation of an insoluble and insulating product onto the sensing interface changed the charge transfer resistance (R ct) characteristics significantly. The detection limit of 100 fg/mL was determined for ACTH in a 5 μL sample volume. which indicated that this versatile platform can be easily adapted for miniaturized electrochemical immunosensing of cancer marker biomolecules. High selectivity and sensitivity of our immunoassay to detect ACTH in real samples demonstrated its promising potential for future development and applications using clinical samples.

However hydrogen sorption in Mg typically requires ∼573 K. whereas the target operation temperature of fuel cells in automobiles is ∼373 K or less. Here we demonstrate that stress-induced orthorhombic Mg hydride (O-MgH2) is thermodynamically destabilized at ∼ 373 K or lower. Such drastic destabilization arises from large tensile stress in single layer O-MgH2 bonded to rigid substrate. or compressive stress due to large volume change incompatibility in Mg/Nb multilayers.

ZnFe2O4 (ZFO). is an emerging photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar fuel production. However. a lack of fundamental insight into the factors limiting the photocurrent has prevented substantial advance in its performance. Herein. it is found that ZFO nanorod array photoelectrodes with varying crystallinity exhibit vastly different PEC properties. Using a sacrificial hole scavenger (H2O2). spatially defined carrier generation. and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. it is shown that ZFO with a relatively poor crystallinity but a higher spinel inversion degree (due to cation disorder) exhibits superior photogenerated charge separation efficiency and improved majority charge carrier transport compared to ZFO with higher crystallinity and a lower inversion degree.

However. attempts to mechanically exfoliate BP have had limited success leaving many predictions untested. Here I describe a reliable method of synthesis and thickness-based selection using liquid exfoliation and centrifugation. An extensive solvent and centrifugation speed study detail optimal parameters for exfoliation. An additional barrier is the material’s instability in ambient conditions. readily undergoing oxidation. While this instability is widely known. little is understood about the mechanism of degradation nor the resulting oxide species formed. I present here a series of time-lapse studies showing degradation of thin 2D BP over time for different environmental parameters. In these studies. I describe conditions necessary to induce oxidation and degradation. I show that. in contrast to popular belief. light is not required to induce damage in 2D BP samples. Water-only environments demonstrate the material’s ability to reduce water while oxygen-only environments result in self-passivating layers. which deter further oxidation. Meanwhile. environments that contain both elements experience considerably accelerated rates of degradation.

Currently. most RNA labeling methods utilize RNA-nucleic acid or RNA-protein molecular recognition. However. in the search for improved RNA labeling methods. harnessing the small-molecule recognition capabilities of RNA is rapidly emerging as a promising alternative. Along these lines. we propose a novel strategy in which a ribozyme acts to promote self-alkylation with a fluorophore. providing a robust. covalent linkage between the RNA and the fluorophore. Here we describe the selection and characterization of ribozymes that promote self-labeling with fluorescein iodoacetamide (FIA). Kinetic studies reveal a second-order rate constant that is on par with those of other reactions used for biomolecular labeling. Additionally. we demonstrate that labeling is specific to the ribozyme sequences …,True,J8gZyjgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,33,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cb5002119,5147292912067731257,/scholar?cites=5147292912067731257,,,0,0,0

Most detection probes rely on the conjugation of small molecule dyes to nucleic acids for fluorescence output. which is not cost-effective and also limits their applications in vivo. as they are not genetically encodable. More affordable sensors devoid of any chemical labeling are needed that show high fluorescence output and are genetically encodable. Here. we have designed a label-free Baby Spinach-based minimal modified sensor (BSMS) for the analysis of nucleic acids. The minimal modification in the sensor design reduces the complexity of the design. and provides additional stabilization after binding the target nucleic acids. leading to a high fluorescence output.

Lithium iron phosphate is most highly developed from this family. but LiMnPO4 is supposed as much promising. due to its higher EMF vs. lithium. One of the main lacks of this class of materials is the low electronic conductivity. The traditional ways of conductivity increase by partial replacement of Mn with other transition metal for LiMnPO4 do not result to essential success.

The OFDM has many advantages over other techniques such as its high capacity and immunity against multipath fading channels. However. one of the main drawbacks of the OFDM system is the high-peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) that leads the system to produce in-band distortion and out-of-band radiation because of the non-linearity of the high-power amplifiers. Therefore. numerous techniques have been proposed to overcome the PAPR problem such as selective mapping. partial transmit sequence (PTS). clipping. and nonlinear companding. In this paper. the PTS technique was analytically reviewed as one of the important methods to reduce the high PAPR problem.

The Michaelis constant. K m of free alpha-amylase. glucoamylase and cellulase were 2.0831. 1.8326 and 7.8592 mg/mL. respectively. whereas for the encapsulated system. the K m values were 3.1604. 2.1708 and 9.2791 mg/mL. respectively. The results showed encapsulation enzymes gave higher K m value than the free enzymes. Comparatively the encapsulated alpha-amylase was 1.5 times higher and the glucoamylase and cellulase were 1.18 times higher. This suggests that the affinity of encapsulated enzymes for substrate was lower which might be due to the diffusional limitation of the substrate and enzymes. Amongst the three in both systems. glucoamylase was determined to have highest affinity followed by alpha-amylase and cellulase enzymes.,True,g5PefZUAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,11,https://www.scientific.net/AMM.393.115,3526958480888573636,/scholar?cites=3526958480888573636,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miradatul-Muhd-Rodhi/publication/271391549_Nanoclay_Supporting_Materials_for_Enzymes_Immobilization_Kinetics_Investigation_of_Free_and_Immobilized_System/links/6050b421458515e8344e3a85/Nanoclay-Supporting-Materials-for-Enzymes-Immobilization-Kinetics-Investigation-of-Free-and-Immobilized-System.pdf,0,0,0

In Spin Crossover materials. the intermolecular coupling originates from a volume difference between the High Spin and the Low Spin molecular states and is simulated by anharmonic interaction potentials whose strengths are molecular-state-dependent.

The work here is concerned with a cloaked fluorophore composed of a reporter whose fluorescence is efficiently quenched by it being bound to an activatable trigger group through a novel self-immolative linker. Highly selective and rapid activation of the trigger group is achieved by chemical and enzymatic means that result in activated trigger group detachment from the self-immolative linker. with the latter subsequently cleaved from the reporter autonomously. thereby unmasking intense. red-shifted fluorescence emission.

It is characterized by a polyhedral clathrin lattice that coats budding membranes.  The mechanism and control of lattice assembly. curvature. and vesicle formation at the plasma membrane has been a matter of longstanding debate. Here. we use platinum replica and cryo electron microscopy and tomography to present a global structural framework of the pathway. We determine the shape and size parameters common to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We show that clathrin sites maintain a constant surface area during curvature across multiple cell lines. Flat clathrin is present in all cells and spontaneously curves into coated pits without additional energy sources or recruited bending factors.  Finally. we attribute curvature generation to loosely connected and pentagon-containing flat lattices that can rapidly curve when a flattening force is released.
