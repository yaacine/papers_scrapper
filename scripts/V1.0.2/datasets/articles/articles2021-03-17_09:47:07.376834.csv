GC methods for fatty acid (FA) analysis have been updated by improving the separation of TFAs from other FAs. especially trans- and cis-18:1. and by focusing more attention on the FAs contained in fats and oils in lower amounts. FA analysis is affected by the limited availability of reference materials. Identifications are frequently made simply by comparison with separations reported in the literature.

To screen EVOO. a partial least squares (PLS1) calibration model was developed to estimate a newly created FT‐NIR index based mainly on the relative intensities of two unique carbonyl overtone absorptions in the FT‐NIR spectra of EVOO and other mixtures attributed to volatile (5280 cm−1) and non‐volatile (5180 cm−1) components. Spectra were also used to predict the fatty acid (FA) composition of EVOO or samples spiked with an adulterant using previously developed PLS1 calibration models.

Rather than employing two GC columns of different polarities or using different elution temperatures. the separation in the two-dimensional space is achieved by altering the chemical structure of selected analytes between the two dimensions of separation. A capillary tube coated with palladium is added between the first dimension of separation (1D) column and the cryogenic modulator. providing the reduction of unsaturated FAMEs to their fully saturated forms. The 2D separation is achieved using a 2.5 m × 0.10 mm SLB-IL111 capillary column and separates FAMEs based solely on their carbon skeleton.

However. it is time consuming and requires complex calculations and a high memory machine. In this study. two networks were used for damage classification: multiclass support vector machine (M-SVM) and combination of multilayer perceptron neural network with M-SVM (MM-SVM). In order to collect data. three frames of R/C slab column frame buildings with wide beams in slab were considered. For NTHA. twenty different ground motion records were selected and scaled to ten different levels of peak ground acceleration (PGA). Thus. 600 obtained data from the numerical simulations were applied to M-SVM and MM-SVM in order to predict the global damage classification of samples based on park and Ang damage index. Amongst the four different kernel tricks. the Gaussian function was determined as an efficient kernel trick using the maximum total accuracy method of test data. By comparing the obtained results from M-SVM and MM-SVM. the total classification accuracy of MM-SVM is more than M-SVM and it is accurate and reliable for global damage classification of R/C slab column frames.

ARPES allows the direct measurement of the electronic band structure of materials generating extremely useful insights into their electronic properties. The possibility to apply this technique to 2D materials is of paramount importance because these ultrathin layers are considered fundamental for future electronic. photonic and spintronic devices. In this review an overview of the technical aspects of spatially localized ARPES is given along with a description of the most advanced setups for laboratory and synchrotron-based equipment. This technique is sensitive to the lateral dimensions of the sample. Therefore. a discussion on the preparation methods of 2D material is presented. Some of the most interesting results obtained by ARPES are reported in three sections including: graphene. transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and 2D heterostructures. Graphene has played a key role in ARPES studies because it inspired the use of this technique with other 2D materials. TMDCs are presented for their peculiar transport. optical and spin properties.

These symbioses are often re-established every generation with high specificity. but gaps remain in our understanding of the cellular mechanisms that control symbiont recognition and uptake dynamics. Here. we tested whether differences in glycan profiles among different symbiont species account for the different rates at which they initially colonize aposymbiotic polyps of the model sea anemone Aiptasia (Exaiptasia pallida). First. we used a lectin array to characterize the glycan profiles of colonizing Symbiodinium minutum (ITS2 type B1) and non-colonizing S. pilosum (ITS2 type A2). finding subtle differences in the binding of lectins EEL and UDA that distinguish between high-mannoside and hybrid-type protein linked glycans. Next. we enzymatically cleaved glycans from the surfaces of S. minutum cultures and followed their recovery using flow cytometry. establishing a 48-72 hour glycan turnover rate for this species. Finally. we exposed aposymbiotic host polyps to cultured S. minutum cells masked by EEL or UDA lectins for 48 hours. then measured cell densities the following day. We found no effect of glycan masking on symbiont density. providing further support to the hypothesis that glycan-lectin interactions are more important for post-phagocytic persistence of specific symbionts than they are for initial uptake.

Cancer cells are known to reprogram their metabolism using different strategies to meet energetic and anabolic needs (Koppenol et al.. 2011; Zheng. 2012). Additionally. each cancer tissue has its own individual metabolic features. Mitochondria not only play a key role in energy metabolism but also in cell cycle regulation of cells. Therefore. mitochondria have emerged as a potential target for anticancer therapy since they are structurally and functionally different from their non-cancerous counterparts (D'Souza et al.. 2011). We detail a protocol for measurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) measurements in living cells. utilizing the Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Figure 1). The Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer continuously measures oxygen concentration and proton flux in the cell supernatant over time (Wu et al.. 2007). These measurements are converted in OCR and ECAR values and enable a direct quantification of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. With this protocol. we sought to assess basal mitochondrial function and mitochondrial stress of three different cancer cell lines in response to the cytotoxic test lead compound mensacarcin in order to investigate its mechanism of action.

The compound is examined by a combination of experimental and computational techniques in order to elucidate the nature of its electronic structure and slow magnetic relaxation. We demonstrate that any sensible model of the electronic structure must include a proper treatment of the first-order orbital angular momentum. and we find that the slow magnetic relaxation can be well described by a two-phonon Raman process dominating at high temperature. with a temperature independent quantum tunnelling pathway being most efficient at low temperature.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a promising tool for DNA analyses by providing intrinsic chemical information with a high sensitivity. To address the irreproducibility in SERS analysis that hampers reliable DNA detection. we used iodide-modified Ag nanoparticles to obtain highly reproducible SERS signals of single- and double-strand DNA in aqueous solutions close to physiological conditions. The phosphate backbone signal was used as an internal standard to calibrate the absolute signal of each base for a more reliable determination of the DNA structure. which has not been achieved before.

Their goal is the same. that to create a variety of new matter and new functional materials. In accordance with their similarities. the concept of catalysis. which is widely used in chemical synthesis. could be extended to assembly. Herein we suggest that the term “cassemblysis” be used when referring to increased rates and control during assembly. The role played by a cassemblyst in molecular assembly is similar to that played by a catalyst in a synthesis with high efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore. it may be helpful to classify some terms which are used often but without clarity in the literature. such as self-assembly and assisted self-assembly. Molecular assembly can be divided into two major types. self-assembly and assisted assembly. Most assembly processes belong to assisted assembly. which can be further divided into three categories: cassemblysis. co-assembly and field-assisted assembly. Of these three. cassemblysis is the most efficient way to create new materials (e.g.. soft matter) above the molecular level. After cassemblysis. some assembly systems undergo a chemical coupling reaction which significantly enhances stability and prevents them from de-assembling. This increased stability is essential for practical applications. We call this cassembly-reaction process “catassemblysis”. We present some typical examples involving small molecules and large biological molecules to show that cassemblysis and catassemblysis are very common. especially in biological systems.

While two-photon absorption has been described for molecules such as laser dyes in solution for a number of years1. it has only been recently that researchers have attempted detailed structure-property relationships to elucidate how new chromophores with greatly enhanced two-photon cross-sections might be designed. Since the intrinsic cross-sections are related to the Im component of the third order optical nonlinearity. it should come as no surprise that much of the previous work in the literature which focused on structure-property relationships for molecules with enhanced NLO response might be applicable to the design of new TPA chromophores.

FTIR. SEM. and TGA techniques and incinerated in temperature range 650–950°C for 2 h. The effect of incineration temperature on the microstructure and pozzolanic activity of the resultant ash was investigated by techniques mentioned above as well as Chapelle test. It was concluded that incineration of sewage sludge affects the microstructure and pozzolanic activity of the resultant ash. During incineration at temperatures lower than 800°C. amorphous silica captures fixed carbon resulting from incomplete combustion conditions whereas at higher temperatures crystallization of amorphous silica was enhanced. Hydration products formed from hydrothermal treatment of silica fume with lime is amorphous whereas that of sewage sludge ash is fibrous.

Sanchez‐Palencia In this paper. we investigate the dynamic of DNA described via DNA double‐stranded model with transverse and longitudinal motions. This model admits solitary. soliton. periodic. or chirped wave solution. It is justified that the most admissible physical solution is the soliton or chirped wave solution. The stability analysis of all these solutions is performed by using the Sturm–Liouville problem and the topological invariance. We found that soliton and chirped waves are unstable so that the unbounded amplitude may occur. In the view of these models. damage of DNA membrane or bases may occur under small disturbance. Also. the suggested models will be indispensable when inhomogeneity or medium dissipation is taken into account. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons.

They are bio-synthesized from cholesterol through a series of enzyme-mediated transformations. so they are highly lipophilic and readily enter most cells to interact with intracellular receptors. making them ideal vehicles for targeting a broad array of pathologies. New curative agents for cancers have been developed from several steroidal derivatives. Some biologically important properties of modified steroids are dependent on structural features of the steroid moiety and their side chains. Therefore. chemical derivatization of steroids provides a way to modify their function. and many structure–activity relationships have been confirmed by such synthetic modifications.

However. it is conceivable that effects due to the anesthesia and/or intranasal infection procedure might introduce artifacts. We therefore aimed to evaluate the effects of anesthesia and/or intranasal infection on transcription of selected pulmonary mRNAs in two inbred mouse strains with differential susceptibility to IAV infection. DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice were evaluated in a time course experiment in which lung tissue was sampled after 6. 12. 18. 24. 48 and 120 h. After anesthesia with ketamine and xylazine. a suspension of mouse-adapted IAV strain PR8_Mun in 20 μl sterile buffer. or 20 μl sterile buffer only. was instilled intranasally. The mice receiving anesthesia and PBS only were designated the “mock treatment” group. Pulmonary expression of 10 host mRNAs (Fos. Retnla. Irg1. Il6. Il1b. Cxcl10. Stat1. Ifng. Ifnl2. and Mx1) and viral hemagglutinin (HA) mRNA were determined at the designated time points. As expected. weight loss and viral replication were greater in the DBA/2J strain (which is more susceptible to IAV infection). Four mRNAs (Retnla. Irg1.

This fact raises the concern that reassortment between H1N1pdm09 and co-circulating viruses might lead to an increase of H1N1pdm09 pathogenicity in different susceptible host species. Herein. we explored the potential of different NS segments to enhance the replication dynamics. pathogenicity and host range of H1N1pdm09 strain A/Giessen/06/09 (Gi-wt). The NS segments were derived from (i) human H1N1- and H3N2 IAVs. (ii) highly pathogenic- (H5- or H7-subtypes) or (iii) low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (H7- or H9-subtypes). A significant increase of growth kinetics in A549 (human lung epithelia) and NPTr (porcine tracheal epithelia) cells was only noticed in vitro for the reassortant Gi-NS-PR8 carrying the NS segment of the 1918-descendent A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8-wt. H1N1). whereas all other reassortants showed either reduced or comparable replication efficiencies. Analysis using ex vivo tracheal organ cultures of turkeys (TOC-Tu). a species susceptible to IAV H1N1 infection. demonstrated increased replication of Gi-NS-PR8 compared to Gi-wt. Also. Gi-NS-PR8 induced a markedly higher expression of immunoregulatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines. chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes in A549 cells.

1175882,The interferon-induced gene Ifi27l2a is active in lung macrophages and lymphocytes after influenza A infection but deletion of Ifi27l2a in mice does not increase susceptibility …,2014,Mohamed A Tantawy and Bastian Hatesuer and Esther Wilk and Leonie Dengler and Nadine Kasnitz and Siegfried Weiß and Klaus Schughart,9,PloS one,9,e106392,Public Library of Science,Interferons represent one of the first and essential host defense mechanisms after infection. and the activation of the IFN-pathway results in the transcriptional activation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. The alpha-inducible protein 27 like 2A (Ifi27l2a) gene (human synonym: ISG12) is strongly up-regulated in the lung after influenza A infection in mice and has been shown in gene expression studies to be highly correlated to other activated genes. Therefore. we investigated the role of Ifi27l2a for the host defense to influenza A infections in more detail. RT-PCR analyses in non-infected mice demonstrated that Ifi27l2a was expressed in several tissues. including the lung. Detailed analyses of reporter gene expression in lungs from Ifi27l2a-LacZ mice revealed that Ifi27l2a was expressed in macrophages and lymphocytes but not in alveolar cells or bronchiolar epithelium cells. The number of macrophages and lymphocyte strongly increased in the lung after infection. but no significant increase in expression levels of the LacZ reporter gene was found within individual immune cells. Also. no reporter gene expression was found in bronchiolar epithelial cells. alveolar cells or infiltrating neutrophils after infection. Thus. up-regulation of Ifi27l2a in infected lungs is mainly due to the infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes. Most surprisingly. deletion of Ifi27l2a in mouse knock-out lines did not result in increased susceptibility to infections with H1N1 or H7N7 influenza A virus compared to wild type C57BL/6N mice. suggesting a less important role of the gene for the host response to influenza infections than for bacterial infections.,True,pW84y_AAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,14,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106392,3128541884472185502,/scholar?cites=3128541884472185502,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106392,0,0,0

These gene expression systems rely on a specific promoter region to drive the transcription of genes either constitutively (i.e.. in a continually “ON” state) or conditionally (i.e.. in response to a specific transcription initiator). However. controlling plasmid-based expression with high spatial and temporal resolution in cellular environments and in multicellular organisms remains challenging. To overcome this limitation. we have site-specifically installed nucleobase-caging groups within a plasmid promoter region to enable optochemical control of transcription and. thus. gene expression. via photolysis of the caging groups.

Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) are genetic control elements that can be used to specifically control the expression of genes through correction of aberrant splicing pathways. A current limitation with SSO methodologies is the inability to achieve conditional control of their function paired with high spatial and temporal resolution. We addressed this limitation through site-specific installation of light-removable nucleobase-caging groups as well as photocleavable backbone linkers into synthetic SSOs.

Therefore. all of these ligands are best classified as bi-topic ligands that possess high affinity binding at an allosteric site to engender selective M1 activation. but all bind. at higher concentrations. to the orthosteric ACh site. leading to non-selective orthosteric site binding and mAChR antagonism.,True,DdzF4tAAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,12,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X12014345,7460671112454907292,/scholar?cites=7460671112454907292,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3525729/,0,0,0

The corrosion resistance and the influence of zinc content on electrochemical behaviour of some special alloys Sn‐In‐Zn in 3% NaCl solution has been investigated using electrochemical techniques. The good resistance of this ternary system is confirmed. In decreasing dissolution rate. they are ranked as follows: 40Pb‐60Sn. Sn‐10.6In‐27Zn. Sn‐11In‐23Zn and Sn‐13In‐12Zn.

An ultimate test of our knowledge of how metalloproteins work is to design new metalloproteins. Doing so not only can reveal hidden structural features that may be missing from studies of native metalloproteins and their variants. but also can result in new metalloenzymes for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications. Although it is much more challenging to design metalloproteins than non-metalloproteins. much progress has been made in this area. particularly in functional design. owing to recent advances in areas such as computational and structural biology.,True,MLAl3y4AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,635,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08304,10646802234813768013,/scholar?cites=10646802234813768013,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2770889/,0,0,0

Lower levels of formate. ethylene glycol. and t-butanol were also produced. At an applied potential of −0.59 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. the Faradaic efficiencies for reduction of CO2 to 1-propanol were ∼3.5% for MoS2 single crystals and ∼1% for thin films with low edge-site densities. Reduction of CO2 to 1-propanol is a kinetically challenging reaction that requires the overall transfer of 18 e– and 18 H+ in a process that involves the formation of 2 C–C bonds.

1176290,The Discovery of Novel Materials for the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide,2018,Daniel Anthony Torelli,,,,,,The removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide is likely the only route to mitigating the effects of decades of increased fossil fuel combustion. Artificial photosynthesis presents one method for removal and conversion of problematic carbon dioxide into chemically useful products. By coupling electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to a renewable energy source atmospheric CO2 could be converted back into a fuel such as ethanol. or a commodity chemical such as ethylene.  These products could then be consumed for energy or used to generate plastics effectively removing CO2 from the atmosphere.  Significant advances in current electrocatalysts are needed in order for large scale CO2R to become a reality.  Most known catalysts are only capable of transferring 2 electrons with needed protons to CO2 producing either carbon monoxide or formic acid. Copper is the only known metal capable of reducing CO2 to hydrocarbons at appreciable rates and low overpotentials. This work aims to find new materials that produce similar hydrocarbons. but at lower overpotentials with higher rates and greater selectivity than current copper catalysts. By implementing a cyclic process referred to as the Catalyst Discovery Cycle (CDC) iterations between predications. catalyst testing. and active site characterization allow for the rational design and discovery of new and improved catalysts. This methodology led to the discovery of nickel-gallium bimetallics as low overpotential catalysts for CO2R to methane. ethylene. and ethane. In addition. theoretical and experimental observations have determined a proposed active site and side reactions detrimental to their activity.,True,lG_EqXgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/10962/,,,,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/10962/10/Torelli-Thesis-The%20Discovery%20of%20Novel%20Materials%20for%20the%20Electrocatalytic%20Reduction%20of%20Carbon%20Dioxide.pdf,0,0,0

The Ni-Ga thin films produce mixtures of methane. ethylene and ethane at potentials as anodic as -0.48V vs RHE. representing some of the lowest onset potentials for C2-product formation reported to date. While polycrystalline Cu also produces CH4 and C2H4. the onset potential for these products on Ni-Ga films is several hundred millivolts more positive. However. the current densities on Ni-Ga are ~ 3 orders of magnitude lower than Cu. One strategy to improve the current densities is the use of nanostructured Ni-Ga catalysts.

However. although these techniques possess great potential their development depends critically on the nonlinear optical effects used and on the availability of nonlinear optical materials that work at high speed and low incident optical power. At present. these requirements are stimulating a great deal of research in materials science and are challenging existing technologies. in particular high speed electronics. This volume devoted to nonlinear optical effects and materials presents a detailed account of selected topics in inorganic and organic materials re search. The status of organic crystals and polymers for nonlinear optics is critically compared with their inorganic counterparts. The preparation tech niques and a description of the methods used to characterize the nonlinear optical effects relevant for device applications are dealt with. as well as a theoretical description of the nonlinear optical. electro-optical and photore fractive effects observed. The main concepts and potential applications are outlined and developed in the various chapters of this book.

1176343,Self-Assembly in Ultrahigh Vacuum:  Growth of Organic Thin Films with a Stable In-Plane Directional Order,1998,Chengzhi Cai and Martin M Bösch and Ye Tao and Bert Müller and Zhehong Gan and Armin Kündig and Christian Bosshard and Ilias Liakatas and Matthias Jäger and Peter Günter,120,Journal of the American Chemical Society,33,8563-8564,American Chemical Society,Most self-assembled organic thin films are formed in solution. 1 where the adsorbate molecules approach the film surface via diffusion that also makes the intermolecular interaction in the solution inevitable. Therefore. due to the competing aggregation in solution. well-ordered thin films are very difficult to grow continuously in solution at a reasonable rate although they have been formed by repeating the sequential activation-adsorption steps in different solutions. 2 On the other hand. molecules can approach a target without diffusion. ie. without intermolecular interaction. in ultrahigh vacuum (< 10-8 mbar). This is a unique feature of organic molecular beam deposition3 (OMBD. Figure 1A) that allows a one-component self-assembly growth of ordered thin films in a continuous and rapid way. In addition. OMBD has many other advantages over the solution-based techniques. such as negligible contamination and in situ growth control (Figure 1A). Moreover. as we demonstrate here for the first time to our knowledge. an organic thin film can be ordered in situ in any desired direction within the substrate plane by OMBD. 4. 5 Organic thin films with a non-centrosymmetric order have been intensively studied for applications in nonlinear optics. 6. 7 Described here is a novel approach to form such thin films by OMBD. We have designed chromophores so that they are strongly hydrogen-bonded to each other in a head-to-tail fashion to form linear supramolecular assemblies8 in the solid state. Such materials can be sublimated in ultrahigh vacuum (Figure 1B) if the hydrogen bonds can be broken while the molecules are intact at elevated temperatures.

The dimeric lithium complex [(HL)Li]2 (2) containing the monoanionic form of H2L was obtained by treating H2L with nBuLi. The presence of both proton donors and acceptors causes the diimino compound H2L to undergo tautomerization to exhibit an amine–azafulvene structure. though the central amine nitrogen competes for a proton. As a result. in the presence of Pd2+ ions. the cationic complex [Pd(Cl)(H2L)][Cl] (3) containing one pendant amine–azafulvene arm and the protonated central amine nitrogen was obtained.
