A large proportion of benthic marine calcifiers incorporate Mg2+ into their skeletons (Mg‐calcite). which. in general. reduces mineral stability. The relative vulnerability of some marine calcifiers to ocean acidification appears linked to the relative solubility of their shell or skeletal mineralogy. although some organisms have sophisticated mechanisms for constructing and maintaining their CaCO3 structures causing deviation from this dependence. Nevertheless. few studies consider seawater saturation state with respect to the actual Mg‐calcite mineralogy (ΩMg‐x) of a species when evaluating the effect of ocean acidification on that species.

Their associated carbon export from the euphotic zone to the oceans' interior plays a crucial role in CO2 feedback mechanisms and biogeochemical cycles. The coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi has been widely studied as a model organism to understand physiological. biogeochemical. and ecological processes in marine sciences. Here. we show the inter-strain variability in physiological and biogeochemical traits in 13 strains of E. huxleyi from various biogeographical provinces obtained from culture collections commonly used in the literature. Our results demonstrate that inter-strain genetic variability has greater potential to induce larger phenotypic differences than the phenotypic plasticity of single strains cultured under a broad range of variable environmental conditions. The range of variation found in physiological parameters and calcite Sr:Ca highlights the need to reconsider phenotypic variability in paleoproxy calibrations and model parameterizations to adequately translate findings from single strain laboratory experiments to the real ocean.,True,FyCSukMAAAAJ:hefNtdE4IMkC,34,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157697,6927565612285083329,/scholar?cites=6927565612285083329,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157697,0,0,0

Owing to the temperature dependence of the decay rate (Q10  =  4.28). the jelly‐POM export ratio below 500 m is 20–45% larger in subpolar and temperate areas than in the tropics. Vertical migration of gelatinous zooplankton leads to a variable starting depth of a jelly fall (death depth). which governs the start of remineralization. and the fate of the biomass.

The influence of environmental variables on coral calcification rates has been extensively studied. but our understanding of their relative importance is limited by the absence of in situ observations and the ability to decouple the interactions between different properties. We show that temperature is the primary driver of coral colony (Porites astreoides and Diploria labyrinthiformis) and reef-scale calcification rates over a 2-year monitoring period from the Bermuda coral reef. On the basis of multimodel climate simulations (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) and assuming sufficient coral nutrition. our results suggest that P. astreoides and D. labyrinthiformis coral calcification rates in Bermuda could increase throughout the 21st century as a result of gradual warming …,True,FyCSukMAAAAJ:Oo1CbQkBAzEC,33,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701356?utm_cam,16230604212877680674,/scholar?cites=16230604212877680674,,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701356?utm_cam,0,0,0

Calcifying unicellular phytoplankton (coccolithophores) are a major contributor to both carbon and calcium cycling by photosynthesis and the production of calcite (coccoliths) in the euphotic zone. and the subsequent long-term deposition and burial into marine sediments. Here we present data from controlled laboratory experiments on four coccolithophore species and elucidate the relation between the divalent cation (Sr. Mg and Ca) partitioning in coccoliths and cellular physiology (growth. calcification and photosynthesis). Coccolithophores were cultured under different seawater temperature and carbonate chemistry conditions. The partition coefficient of strontium (DSr) was positively correlated with both carbon dioxide (pCO2) and temperature but displayed no coherent relation to particulate organic and inorganic carbon production rates. Furthermore. DSr correlated positively with cellular growth rates when driven by temperature but no correlation was present when changes in growth rates were pCO2-induced. Our results demonstrate the complex interaction between environmental forcing and physiological control on the strontium partitioning in coccolithophore calcite and challenge interpretations of the coccolith Sr / Ca ratio from high-pCO2 environments (e.g. Palaeocene–Eocene thermal maximum). The partition coefficient of magnesium (DMg) displayed species-specific differences and elevated values under nutrient limitation.

Gelatinous zooplankton biomass provides a fast carbon vector that has been poorly studied. Observational data of a large-scale benthic trawling survey from 1994 to 2005 provided a unique opportunity to quantify jelly-carbon along an entire continental margin in the Mediterranean Sea and to assess potential links with biological and physical variables. Biomass depositions were sampled in shelves. slopes and canyons with peaks above 1000 carcasses per trawl. translating to standing stock values between 0.3 and 1.4 mg C m2 after trawling and integrating between 30.000 and 175.000 m2 of seabed. The benthopelagic jelly-carbon spatial distribution from the shelf to the canyons may be explained by atmospheric forcing related with NAO events and dense shelf water cascading. which are both known from the open Mediterranean. Over the decadal scale. we show that the jelly-carbon depositions temporal variability paralleled hydroclimate modifications. and that the enhanced jelly-carbon deposits are connected to a temperature-driven system where chlorophyll plays a minor role.

The incorporation of gallium into the silica framework of KIT‐6 is difficult if the usual synthesis method of KIT‐6 is followed. because it requires a large amount of HCl in the synthesis mixture. Therefore. the amount of HCl in the synthesis mixture is reduced to suitably adjust the solution pH so as to incorporate a large amount of gallium into the silica framework of KIT‐6. The low‐angle powder XRD results confirm that all the samples demonstrate well‐ordered and a cubic 3 D structure with Ia3d symmetry. However. the wide‐angle XRD patterns show no peaks at the higher angle. which confirms the absence of gallium oxide nanoparticles in the nanochannels and the incorporation of gallium atoms into the silica framework.

Of interest was the chemical and textural changes on catalytic properties as a result of the modification. At low loadings of 0.2–0.5 mmol/g of the metals. the isomerization of 4.4′-diisopropybiphenyl (4.4′-DIPB) was effectively prevented at temperatures as high as 300 °C. resulting in high selectivities for 4.4′-DIPB. Metals reduce the acid amounts by low loadings. and deactivate external acid sites. At the loading of 2 mmol/g. only BaMOR was active with high selectivities for 4.4′-DIPB; however. other metals lost catalytic activity with the increase in the loading. These differences are ascribed to changes of acidity and pore size.

These promise to revolutionise our understanding of adaptive immune dynamics. identify novel antibodies. and allow monitoring of minimal residual disease. However. different methods for BCR and TCR enrichment and amplification have been proposed. Here we perform the first systematic comparison between different methods of enrichment. amplification and sequencing for generating BCR and TCR repertoires using large sample numbers. Resampling from the same RNA or cDNA pool results in highly correlated and reproducible repertoires. but resampling low frequency clones leads to stochastic variance. Repertoires generated by different sequencing methods (454 Roche and Illumina MiSeq) and amplification methods (multiplex PCR. 5’ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5’RACE). and RNA-capture) are highly correlated. and resulting IgHV gene frequencies between the different methods were not significantly different. Read length has an impact on captured repertoire structure. and ultimately full-length BCR sequences are most informative for repertoire analysis as diversity outside of the CDR is very useful for phylogenetic analysis. Additionally. we show RNA-based BCR repertoires are more informative than using DNA. Repertoires generated by different sequencing and amplification methods are consistent. but we show that read lengths. depths and error profiles should be considered in experimental design. and multiple sampling approaches could be employed to minimise stochastic sampling variation.

Using longitudinal BCR repertoire sequencing. we find that the BCR undergoes an unexpectedly high level of clonal diversification in B-ALL cells through both somatic hypermutation and secondary rearrangements. which can be used for tracking the subclonal composition of the disease and detect minimal residual disease with unprecedented sensitivity.

Even more importantly ink-jet printing is a technique that is very easy to use and that can be controlled finely without any specialised equipment.Another well documented principle of exerting structural control over a material is the concept of biotemplating. Through evolution. nature has produced magnificent structures of unprecedented complexity and perfection. Even with modern manufacturing techniques man would struggle to produce intricate structures. the likes of which nature has created. with similar speed and in similar quantities. Subsequently a whole field revolves around employing them as templates. scaffolds or structure directing agents in general.[3],True,ZMwOh0AAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,1,https://d-nb.info/1032399155/34,13372714721606721912,/scholar?cites=13372714721606721912,,,0,0,0

In plasmid DNA (pDNA) transfection studies. these cationic lipids were formulated into cationic liposomes with the neutral co-lipid dioleoyl-L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) or with a recently reported neutral lipophosphoramidate derivative of histamine (MM27). We observe that cationic liposomes prepared from the cationic lipid N′.N′-dioctadecyl-N-4.8-diaza-10-aminodecanoylglycine amide (DODAG) and DOPE frequently mediate the highest levels of transfection in vitro in all three different cell lines studied (OVCAR-3.

These lipids contained various cationic headgroups. such as arginine methyl ester. lysine methyl ester. homoarginine methyl ester. ethylenediamine. diaminopropane. guanidinium and imidazolium. Their transfection abilities. either alone or with the co‐lipid DOPE. were evaluated in HEK293–T7 cells.

This PEG layer ensures the colloidal stability of pDNA-nanoparticles in biological fluids and minimizes nanoparticle interactions with the reticulo-endothelical system. Unfortunately. the presence of the PEG layer appears to contribute to a reduction in efficiency of functional delivery of pDNA once target cells are reached.

Although cationic lipids are the most commonly used synthetic delivery vectors. a clear need still exists for a better delivery of various types of nucleic acids molecules to improve their biological activity. To optimize the transfection efficiency. a molecular approach consisting in modifying the chemical structure of a given cationic lipid is usually performed. but an alternative strategy could rely on modulating the supramolecular assembly of lipidic lamellar phases sandwiching the nucleic acids molecules.

However. the conclusion from clinical data using these vectors is that there is a need to develop new AAVs with a higher transduction efficiency and specificity for relevant target tissues. To overcome these limitations. we chemically modified the surface of the capsid of AAV vectors.

In particular. a wide range of biorthogonal labelling strategies have been reported to functionalise the phenol side chain of tyrosines (Tyr). Tyr occur at medium frequency and are partially buried at the protein surface. offering interesting opportunities for site-selective labelling of the most reactive residues. Tyr-targeting has proved effective for designing a wide range of important biomolecules including antibody–drug conjugates. fluorescent or radioactive protein probes. glycovaccines. protein aggregates. and PEG conjugates. Innovative methods have also been reported for sitespecific labelling with ligand-directed anchors and for the specific affinity capture of proteins.

Rodríguez-López,,Journal of the Electrochemical Society,,,,We recently showed that viologen-based redox active polymers (RAPs) with molecular weights between 21 and 318 kDa are attractive charge storage materials as anolytes for size-selective non-aqueous redox flow batteries. Here. we characterize the electron transfer mechanisms of these RAPs. as well as a ferrocene based catholyte RAP. in acetonitrile/Li+ electrolyte. We utilized scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry to measure the rate of electron transfer and the rate of charge hopping between neighboring pendants along the insulating backbone of RAPs. The electron transfer kinetics of a 271 kDa ferrocene RAP mimic the facile kinetics of its monomer repeating unit. In contrast. viologen RAPs displayed RDE and SECM signatures that suggest a preceding chemical step to electron transfer.

We consider two alternative surface modifications: a cobalt oxo/hydroxo-based (CoOx) overlayer. reported previously to function as an efficient water oxidation electrocatalyst. and a Ga2O3 overlayer. reported to passivate hematite surface states. Transient absorption studies of these composite electrodes under applied bias showed that the cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset observed after each of the surface modifications is accompanied by a similar cathodic shift of the appearance of long-lived hematite photoholes. due to a retardation of electron/hole recombination.

Similar electrochemical water oxidation performance is observed for each of the FeOOH. Ni (Fe) OOH and FeOOHNiOOH electrocatalysts studied. which is found to result from a balance between degree of charge accumulation and rate of water oxidation. Once added onto BiVO4 photoanodes. a large enhancement in the water oxidation photoelectrochemical performance is observed in comparison to the un-modified BiVO4. To understand the origin of this enhancement. the films were evaluated through time-resolved optical spectroscopic techniques. allowing comparisons between electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water oxidation. For all three catalysts. fast hole transfer from BiVO4 to the catalyst is observed in the transient absorption data. Using operando photoinduced absorption measurements. we find that water oxidation is driven by oxidised states within the catalyst layer. following hole transfer from BiVO4. This charge transfer is correlated with a suppression of recombination losses which result in remarkably enhanced water oxidation performance relative to un-modified BiVO4. Moreover. despite similar electrocatalytic performance of all three electrocatalysts. we show that variations in water oxidation performance observed among the BiVO4/MOOH photoanodes stem from differences in photoelectrochemical and electrochemical charge accumulation in the catalyst layers.

The interfaces between fillers and matrix play a critical role in dictating the overall performance of a composite. However. the load transfer mechanism along graphene-polymer interface has not been well understood. In this study. we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of surface functionalization and layer length on the interfacial load transfer in graphene-polymer nanocomposites. The simulation results show that oxygen-functionalized graphene leads to larger interfacial shear force than hydrogen-functionalized and pristine ones during pull-out process. The increase of oxygen coverage and layer length enhances interfacial shear force. Further increase of oxygen coverage to about 7% leads to a saturated interfacial shear force.

In particular. model I fracture toughness was increased by nearly 50% with the addition of 0.1 wt% GO to epoxy. The toughening mechanism was understood by fractography analysis of the tested samples. The more irregular. coarse and multi-plane fracture surfaces of the epoxy/GO nanocomposites were observed. This implies that the two-dimensional GO sheets effectively disturbed and deflected the crack propagation. At 0.5 wt% GO. elastic modulus was~ 35% greater than neat epoxy. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed that GO addition moderately affect the glass transition temperature (Tg) of epoxy. The maximum decrease of Tg by~ 7oC was shown for the nanocomposite with 0.5 wt% GO. DSC results further revealed that GO significantly hindered the cure reaction in the epoxy system.,True,3xLItHUAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/17cb/af401f0fba3a301dc06cac131f12c179de6c.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/17cb/af401f0fba3a301dc06cac131f12c179de6c.pdf,0,0,0

A manufacturing process based on the polymer replica technique was established. A polyurethane template is impregnated with a nanoscaled SiO2 powder suspension (solids loading of 60 wt% at around pH 10) and dried. The green body is prepared by burning-out the polymer at 800 C. Subsequently the sintering of the remaining SiO2 structure to transparent cellular bodies is carried out at 1330 C. Many different factors influence the process. The slurry stabilization (viscosity. zeta-potential. pH) is important to generate a stable and self-supporting SiO2 shell around the template and achieve appropriate green bodies. The sintering temperature determines the transition of amorphous (transparent) into crystalline silica. The 8 ppi sponge has a porosity of 0.9. the specific surface area of 568 m-1 means an increase of the (inner) surface to volume ratio of the reactor. Porous glass has a very high surface to volume ratio (about 0.26 m2/g of glass at 10 µm pore size). Because of multiple and complex reflection of light into the porous glass. the algae can obtain light energy at any location of the total volume. First cultivation experiments in special designed Miniplate reactors show an increase in growth rate (about+ 25%) at low cell densities. The photo conversion efficiency was enlarged from 4.9% for the empty reactor to 5.6% and 5.9% for the 8 and 15 ppi sponge filled reactor.

PDCs are manufactured of polymeric precursors. which contain ceramic forming elements. An additional advantage is that particle size can be easily controlled by conventional milling techniques. Therefore. a desired microstructure of sintered parts can be derived. 2) Complex shapes can be realized with PDCs by using polymer-forming techniques. The challenge of producing monolithic and dense samples lies in compensation of the shrinkage and weight loss during pyrolysis. By the use of MoSi2 particles as filler. shrinkage can be reduced3) and furthermore. the conductivity of the composite can be tailored. In general. MoSi2 is an attractive material for high temperature applications in oxidizing atmospheres. especially when a high electrical conductivity is required. 4) Its outstanding oxidation resistance is a result of the formation of a glassy SiO2 film. which forms a protective layer when the material is exposed to an oxidizing atmosphere at high temperatures (above 800 C). 5). 6) In the temperature range around 400 to 800 C. however. it comes to active oxidation. This so called pest oxidation correlates with the porosity in that way. that denser materials are less susceptible. 7) Above 800 C. the diffusion rate of Si is sufficiently high to form SiO2 on the outer surface. 8) For that reasons.

Application to reversible photocontrol of DNA higher-order structure,2011,Sergii Rudiuk and Kenichi Yoshikawa and Damien Baigl,7,Soft Matter,12,5854-5860,Royal Society of Chemistry,We report for the first time that negatively charged silica nanoparticles (NPs) enhance the ability of cationic surfactants to induce genomic DNA compaction. Single-chain compaction of duplex DNA molecules was studied by fluorescence microscopy in the presence of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) and NPs. We found that very small amounts of NPs (∼10−4 to 10−2 wt%) significantly decreased the concentration of the surfactant at which DNA is compacted.

The thermodynamic parameters. Δ H.

Based on the number of binding sites. it was considered that one molecule of FDQL could bind to a single site of HSA. Site marker competition experiments indicated that the reactive site of HSA to FDQL mainly located in site II (subdomain IIIA). The substitution by fluorine in the benzene ring could increase the interactions between FDQL and HSA to some extent in the proper temperature range through hydrophobic effect. and the substitution at meta-position enhanced the affinity greater than that at para-and ortho-positions.

Therefore. it is necessary to develop effective methods for monitoring Co2+. In the present work. a novel. low-toxic fluorescent probe. PEPA. for the rapid and efficient detection of Co2+ is synthesized. PEPA shows high sensitivity. with a limit of detection of 0.104 μM and a fast response to Co2+ (<4 min). The detection mechanism was confirmed by FT-IR. HRMS and DFT calculations. Co2+ can restrict the free rotation of the CN group and the pyrazine ring of PEPA. resulting in the enhancement of fluorescence. In addition. the recognition process of Co2+ can be realized with the naked eye (i.e.. a color change from colorless to blue fluorescence). The successful detection of Co2+ in test strips and environmental water samples provides strong support for its application potential.

To specifically monitor the level of Cys. a ratiometric fluorescent probe (DDEA) with a large Stokes shift (186 nm) was developed. Due to the excellent spectral performance and stable absorption of dicyanoisophorone. the DDEA probe was designed on the basis of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. DDEA can emit intense orange-red fluorescence in the presence of Cys and realize accurate quantitative analysis of Cys. The detection limit of DDEA for Cys is as low as 91 nM. In addition. the results of test strips and calf serum provided strong evidence of the practical applicability of DDEA. Benefitting from the advantages of good cell permeability and low cytotoxicity.

In this work. 6-chloro-1-(3. 3-dimethyl-butanoyl)-2 (un) substitutedphenyl-2. 3-dihydroquinazolin-4 (1H)-one (PDQL) derivatives were designed and synthesized to study the impact of five similar substituents (methyl. methoxy. cyano. trifluoromethyl and isopropyl) on the interactions between PDQL and HSA using a comparative methodology. The results revealed that PDQL quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA through a static quenching process. Displacement experiments with site-specific markers revealed that PDQL binds to HSA at site II (subdomain IIIA) and that there may be only one binding site for PDQL on HSA. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that hydrophobic interactions mainly drove the interactions between PDQL and HSA. The substitution using five similar groups in the benzene ring could increase the interactions between PDQL and HSA to some extent through the van der Waals force or hydrogen bond effects in the proper temperature range. Isopropyl substitution could particularly enhance the binding affinity. as observed via comparative studies View Full-Text,True,7cMA4FAAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,4,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/7/2/200,16633700797361714534,/scholar?cites=16633700797361714534,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/7/2/200/pdf,0,0,0

Results reveal not only random errors due to image noise but also systematic bias present even if the images are noise free. If the displacement between the images is small. bias is small. However. if the displacement between the images is larger than about 1/25 pixel. the bias component of the registration error exceeds the random component for most imaging conditions. Bias also depends on image content: it is generally larger for images with higher spatial frequency content than for images with lower spatial frequency content.

Patients were excluded if they were previously treated for macular edema or proliferative DR or if they had other retinopathies. Medical records were reviewed for ocular interventions including vitrectomy. intravitreal injection. and laser treatment. Need for intervention was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards. Baseline electroretinograms and fundus photographs were obtained. Two definitions of structural positive findings were as follows: 1. Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study diabetic retinopathy severity scale (ETDRS-DR) severity≥ level 53 (ETDRS-DR+) and 2. ETDRS-DR+ or clinically significant macular edema (VTDR+). A positive function finding corresponded to a RETeval DR Score> 23.5 (RETeval+).Results: For patients with VTDR+ the incidence of intervention was 19%. 31%. and 53% after 1. 2. and 3 years of follow-up. In these patients. intervention incidence increased to 34%. 54%. and 74% the subsequent 1. 2. and 3 years if function was above criterion (RETeval+). whereas RETeval− results reduced the risk to 3%. 4%. and 29%. respectively. reducing risk to similar levels seen for patients with VTDR− results at baseline.Conclusions: Prediction of subsequent intervention was best when combining structural and functional information.Translational Relevance: This study demonstrates that clinical …,True,n8qGJhAAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,2,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2770714,16532794830306775686,/scholar?cites=16532794830306775686,,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2770714,0,0,0
1183481,Estimation of sub-micrometer translations of a rigid body using light microscopy,1994,Charles Quentin Davis,,,,,,An algorithm based on optical flow (Horn and Schunck. 1981; Horn and Weldon. Jr.. 1988) is developed. The new algorithm eliminates the linear component of the bias in optical flow's motion estimate. A confidence statistic for the new algorithm is also developed. Statistical performance parameters (bias and standard deviation) are determined from simulations for both the original optical flow algorithm and the bias-compensated algorithm as a function of the distance the target moved and the pictures' signal-to-noise ratio. frequency content. and size. Results of the simulations are verified by using video images of a scene whose motion is independently known. Our target was a 4-5 pixel diameter bead which was dark on a light. uniform background. The image of the bead had non-zero spectral content at all spatial frequencies not aliased by the camera. Under typical conditions. the bias in both algorithms is greater than the standard deviation. except for very small motions (< 0.035 pixels). For motions less than 0.1 pixels. both algorithms had very similar performance. In contrast. for motions greater than 0.1 pixels the bias-compensated algorithm was superior. The bias in the standard optical flow algorithm is unbounded. becoming large (> 0.2 pixels) for displacements greater than 2 pixels. For the biascompensated algorithm. estimates that satisfy the confidence statistic are always less than 0.02 pixels.A system to measure sound-induced motions of inner ear structures has been developed.

The presence of mesogens induces long-range ordered packing of GNPs. Here we report three different ordered liquid crystalline phases built around the GNPs. two of which have not been observed previously in thermotropic liquid crystals. These are the 3D simple hexagonal packing and the face-centred cubic (FCC) packing of spheres. i.e. GNPs in this case. It has been found that the volume fraction of co-ligands in such systems is critical for the anisotropy of the self-assembly of GNPs; either too small or too large a co-ligand volume fraction causes the formation of one of the two nearly or fully isotropic packing types mentioned above. In these two structures the rod-like mesogens have no preferred orientation.

The spheres were found to shrink in volume upon heating and expand upon cooling. as molecules. in some cases nearly half of them. are ejected and reintegrated in the spheres.

For the short wavelengths used in hard X-ray spectroscopy. the dipole approximation may not be adequate.

In quantum-chemical approaches to X-ray spectroscopy. these so-called quadrupole intensities have so far been calculated by including contributions depending on the square of the electric-quadrupole and magnetic-dipole transition moments.

GO has been successfully exploited for its ability to deliver many kinds of drugs into target cells. However. GO toxicity assessment is still controversial. Several studies have demonstrated that GO protein coating is crucial to alleviate the material’s toxicity. Besides. coronation leads to the formation of big agglomerates. reducing the cellular uptake of the material and thus its therapeutic efficiency. In this work. we propose a simple and efficient method based on rapid (ultra-turrax. UT) mixing to control protein corona formation.

Japan experienced the largest earthquake in its history. The undersea earthquake launched a tsunami that inundated much of Japan’s eastern coastline and damaged nuclear power plants. precipitating multiple reactor meltdowns. We examined open-source disaster situation reports. news accounts. and disaster-monitoring websites to gather event-specific data to conduct a trauma signature analysis of the event.Methods: The trauma signature analysis included a review of disaster situation reports; the construction of a hazard profile for the earthquake. tsunami. and radiation threats; enumeration of disaster stressors by disaster phase; identification of salient evidence-based psychological risk factors; summation of the trauma signature based on exposure to hazards. loss. and change; and review of the mental health and psychosocial support responses in relation to the analysis. Results: Exposure to this triple-hazard event resulted in extensive damage. significant loss of life. and massive population displacement. Many citizens were exposed to multiple hazards. The extremity of these exposures was partially mitigated by Japan’s timely. expert-coordinated. and unified activation of an evidence-based mental health response.Conclusions: The eastern Japan disaster was notable for its unique constellation of compounding exposures.

To this end. it is important that systematic investigations be made which address this gap in knowledge. so that the manner in which ionic liquids interact with substrates can be better understood. In this way. we hope to be able to anticipate novel applications of these exciting materials. Furthermore. such data will be essential to chemical engineers if industrial applications are to be developed using ionic liquids.,True,sSpXRNlQnDsC:3fE2CSJIrl8C,10,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-010-0127-4_21,7962783808125204285,/scholar?cites=7962783808125204285,,,0,0,0

Sulfur-Free Ligands.,2019,Francesca Arcudi and Dana Emily Westmoreland and Emily Allyn Weiss,25,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",63,14469-14474,,Colloidal quantum dot (QD) photocatalysts have the electrochemical and optical properties to be highly effective for a range of redox reactions. QDs are proven photo-redox catalysts for a variety of reactions in organic solvent. but are less prominent for aqueous reactions. Aqueous QD photocatalysts require hydrophilic ligand shells that provide long-term colloidal stability but are not so tight-binding as to prevent catalytic substrates from accessing the QD surface. Common thiolate ligands. which also poison many co-catalysts and undergo photo-oxidative desorption. are therefore often not an option. This paper describes a framework for the design of water-solubilizing ligands that are in dynamic exchange on and off the QD surface. but still provide long-term colloidal stability to CdS QDs. The binding affinity and inter-ligand electrostatic interactions of a bifunctional ligand. aminoethyl phosphonic acid (AEP). are tuned with the pH of the dispersion. The key to colloidal stability is electrostatic stabilization of the monolayer. This work demonstrates a means of mimicking the stabilizing power of a thiolate-bound ligand with a zwitterionic tailgroup. but without the thiolate binding group.,True,aGmpM8QAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,2,https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc6854302,13918669807075870923,/scholar?cites=13918669807075870923,,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6854302/bin/nihms1054447-supplement-supp_info.pdf,0,0,0

Besides. due to their low cost. environmentally friendly and low toxicity. CNDs could substitute traditional semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). generally top luminescent materials. but usually made of heavy metals. A very interesting property of CNDs is their tunable emission. characterized by multi-fluorescence colors under varied excitation wavelengths. Photoluminescent CNDs properties give them potential applications in areas such as biomedicine. bioimaging. catalysis. optoelectronics and solar concentrators. Luminescent solar concentrators (LSC) are usually thin plates or sheets made of transparent polymers. such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). doped with photoluminescent species. Direct and diffuse incident sunlight is absorbed by these species and the emitted visible light is guided through the polymer to be collected by attached solar cells. increasing their efficiency. CNDs are promising candidates as luminescent doping species for PMMA in preparing hybrid materials. which could be an advantageous and innovative alternative for solar cells applications.

Herein. we propose a novel α-nanobrachytherapy approach for selective therapy of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. This uses local intratumoral injection of 5-nm-diameter gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) labeled with an α-emitter (211 At). modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains and attached to HER2-specific monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab). The size. shape. morphology. and zeta potential of the 5 nm synthesized AuNPs were characterized by TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and DLS (Dynamic Light Scattering) techniques. The gold nanoparticle surface was modified by PEG and subsequently used for antibody immobilization. Utilizing the high affinity of gold for heavy halogens. the bioconjugate was labelled with 211 At obtained by α irradiation of the bismuth target. The labeling yield of 211 At was greater than 99%. 211 At bioconjugates were stable in human serum. Additionally. in vitro biological studies indicated that 211 At-AuNP-PEG-trastuzumab exhibited higher affinity and cytotoxicity towards the HER2-overexpressing human ovarian SKOV-3 cell line than unmodified nanoparticles. Confocal and dark field microscopy studies revealed that 211 At-AuNP-PEG-trastuzumab was effectively internalized and deposited near the nucleus. These findings show promising potential for the 211 At-AuNP-PEG-trastuzumab radiobioconjugate as a perspective therapeutic agent in the treatment of unresectable solid cancers expressing HER2 receptors.

In this system. the parent compound displays considerable conformational flexibility. yet can be assumed to bind to isophthalate through a well-defined conformer.

Other Pd sources such as allyl and [(cinnamyl) PdCl] 2 dimers and Pd (PPh3) 4 are thermally unstable.,True,0s4q-8oAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.699.4969&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.699.4969&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Compared to industrial polycarbonate production. which involves toxic phosgene reagent. this is a cleaner and greener way which uses a renewable. abundant and non-toxic gas CO2. and has 100% atom economy. This dissertation focuses on the investigation of epoxide reactivities in the copolymerization with CO2 and the properties of the resulting polycarbonates.  First of all. the electronics of the epoxide monomers were studied. Herein. we determined the epoxide coordinating ability. or basicity. by infrared spectroscopy. based on the O-D vibration shifts of CH3OD in epoxides versus that observed in benzene. As expected. epoxides with electron-donating alkyl groups were found to be more basic compared to those with electron-withdrawing substituents. The relative basicities of epoxides were shown to greatly influence the interpretation of reactivity ratios of two epoxides in their terpolymerization with CO2. On the other hand. steric effects of epoxides were also studied by investigating copolymerization of CO2 with a series of butene oxides with methyl substituent groups in different positions. Among these butane oxides. only cis-2-butene oxide when coupled with CO2 was able to produce polycarbonate.  Copolymerizations of different cyclic epoxides with CO2 were discussed regarding their ring sizes and functionalities.

The new technique is called open-flow hot isostatic pressing (OFHIP) technique. In this technique. an isostatic pressure is first applied to the catalyst precursor in an open flow fashion. and then heat is applied. Under this condition. as the organic components gradually decompose and leave the material. the voids left behind are immediately filled by the gas (pressure medium) in flow. This substitution warrants the preservation as well as the uniformity of the voids/pores. The result is a very porous material with uniform pore size distribution.The general goal was to determine the optimal conditions of temperature and pressure for best catalytic activity results.

Surface roughness is found to affect the substrate static and dynamic wettability for root-mean-square roughnesses below 7 nm. The kinetics of liquid–liquid displacement is slowed down drastically by the nanoroughness. Nevertheless. contact line motion is found to be governed by a thermally activated process. This process is not based on a pure molecular adsorption–desorption mechanism. Instead. two different nanoscale local displacements mechanisms occurring in the vicinity of the contact line may account for the thermally activated dynamics: we suggest that both molecular adsorption–desorption processes and contact line pinning on nanodefects play significant roles in controlling water displacement by dodecane on surfaces which are rough at the nanoscale.,True,2PAmK_IAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,22,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp2120274,3887082105218780048,/scholar?cites=3887082105218780048,,,0,0,0

RiPP precursor peptides can undergo extensive enzymatic tailoring to yield structurally and functionally diverse products. and their biosynthetic logic makes them attractive bioengineering targets. Recent work suggests that unrelated RiPP-modifying enzymes contain structurally similar precursor peptide–binding domains. Using profile hidden Markov model comparisons. we discovered related and previously unrecognized peptide-binding domains in proteins spanning the majority of known prokaryotic RiPP classes. and we named this conserved domain the RiPP precursor peptide recognition element (RRE).

They are made by a remarkable post-translational modification process that transforms a linear peptide into a polycyclic structure. We present here the in vitro biosynthesis of the core scaffold of thiomuracin catalyzed by six proteins. We show that cyclodehydration precedes dehydration. and that dehydration is catalyzed by two proteins in a tRNAGlu-dependent manner. The enzyme that generates the pyridine core from two dehydroalanines ejects the leader peptide as a C-terminal carboxamide. Mutagenesis studies of the enzyme TbtD identified important residues for a formal [4+2] cycloaddition process.

Lasso peptides are a class of RiPP defined by an isopeptide linkage between the N-terminal amine and an internal Asp/Glu residue with the C-terminal sequence threaded through the macrocycle. This unique lariat topology. which typically provides considerable stability toward heat and proteases. has stimulated interest in lasso peptides as potential therapeutics. Post-translational modifications beyond the class-defining. threaded macrolactam have been reported. including one example of Arg deimination to yield citrulline (Cit).

1184107,Investigating and engineering the post-translational modifications in RiPP natural product biosynthesis (I) Thiopeptides (II) Sactipeptides,2019,Graham Arthur Hudson,,,,,,Despite remarkable medical advances. including improved sanitation. effective vaccines. and antibiotics. bacterial infections remain a serious threat to human health. Annually. over 17 million people succumb to bacterial infections. with an increasing proportion due to antibiotic resistance. Therefore. there is urgent and continuous need for new antibiotics. Small molecule metabolites from microbes have been a highly productive source of chemical matter that ultimately led to most of today’s clinically used antibiotics. Many of these natural products are derived from polyketide synthase (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) families. including well-known antibiotics such as the beta-lactams. tetracyclines. macrolides. and glycopeptides. With the rising resistance to these proven antibiotic classes. alternative sources of antibiotics must be discovered. The ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) have been attracting interest as one such source of untapped potential. Owing to the unique “promiscuous-yet-specific” biosynthetic paradigm that RiPPs offer. this class of natural products have been an area of intense research. Chapter 1 provides an overview of various RiPP classes. their antibiotic activities. the biosynthesis that creates these remarkable molecules. and discusses their engineering potential.  Chapters 2. 3. and 4 all elaborate further on the thiopeptide class of RiPP antibiotics. Thiopeptides typically display nanomolar activity against pathogenic Firmicutes. such as Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis. and Clostridium difficile.

Herein. a two-step reaction was performed to chemically modify the CH using 1. 4-bis (3-aminopropyl) piperazine to incorporate nitrogen basic centers for cations sorption from the aqueous environment. The resultant functionalized chitosan-based sorbent material was designated as CH-ANP and characterized using various analytical techniques. including elemental analysis. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). 13 C NMR (in solid-state). X-ray diffraction. and thermal analysis. Then. the newly engineered CH-ANP was employed for the removal of copper. lead. and cadmium in the aqueous medium. Langmuir sorption isotherm analysis revealed that the highest sorption abilities achieved were 2.82. 1.96. and 1.60 mmol g− 1 for copper. cadmium. and lead. respectively. Linear and nonlinear regression methods were deployed on the sorption data to study the behavior of the Langmuir. the Freundlich. and the Temkin sorption isotherms. Among the four different forms. the Langmuir isotherm type 1 fit well to the experimental data as compared to the other models. It also showed the lowest values of error. and a higher correlation coefficient than the Freundlich and Temkin models; thus it was the best fit with the experimental data compared to the latter two models.

1184244,Utilization of different microbes in bioremediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils stimulated with inorganic and organic fertilizers,2012,JK Nduka and LN Umeh and IO Okerulu and LN Umedum and HN Okoye,3,J Pet Environ Biotechnol,2,1-9,,Different microbes (E. coli. Proteus. Klebsiella and Pseudomonas sp) were utilized in degradation of different hydrocarbon (Engine oil/diesel. kerosene and fuel) contaminated soils amended with inorganic (NPK and urea) and organic (cow dung and poultry litter) fertilizers and in some their combination. The incubation period ranged from 3–18 days. Bacterial population count and residual hydrocarbon were determined. Results showed that bacterial population count increased as the microbes utilized hydrocarbon for carbon and energy sources. the increase in population count and degradation of the hydrocarbons was stimulated by the fertilizer. It was also observed that as the population count increased due to hydrocarbon utilization for carbon and energy. residual hydrocarbon decreased and percentage degradation increased. Urea fertilizer was the best amendment for E. coli to degrade kerosene. NPK and cow dung differently aided the same E. coli in degrading engine oil. Pseudomonas and Proteus species degraded kerosene and fuel better in the presence of NPK fertilizer. Klebsiella specie degraded diesel and engine oil better when amended with poultry litter and cow dung respectively at least for the first 9 days. More than 90% of the hydrocarbons were degraded within each incubation period. The microbes began to die as from the 15th day of incubation. this may be due to secretion of toxic secondary metabolites. Control experiments revealed that there was initial increase in population count of the microbes as they utilized the hydrocarbon for carbon and energy. but they began to die because of non-stimulation with fertilizer …,True,h7z5d_EAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,27,https://www.academia.edu/download/47345413/2157-7463-3-116.pdf,9433477171442882100,/scholar?cites=9433477171442882100,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47345413/2157-7463-3-116.pdf,0,0,0

The word “Delta” is derived from a Greek alphabet in shape of a pyramidal triangle. A delta is a geographical feature formed when a River diversifies into numerous streams that sometimes inter-connect into an intricate web of Rivers. lagoons. swamps and wet land. The point where the main rivers divides is the top of the pyramid while the base is where the division ends or the River enters the sea or larger water course such as a lake. The Niger Delta on the Atlantic coast is one of the moist important in the world. Other worlds notable Deltas include the Nile. Mississippi. Orinoco. Ganges and Mekong (Ibru. 2001). Deltas are usually fertile. contain diverse resources and are therefore noted for large human settlements and civilizations. The Niger Delta complex is one of the most prominent basins in West Africa and actually the largest delta in Africa. It includes the Imo River and Cross River deltas and extends into the continental margins of Cameroun and Equatorial Guinea (Reijerset al 1996).A more rigorous scientific definition of the territory locates it between Aboh to the North. the Benin River to the west and the Imo River to the East. It is located in the Atlantic coast of Southern Nigeria where River Niger divides into numerous tributaries. The area is the second largest delta in the world spanning a coastline of about 450kms foreclosing at Imo River (Awosika. 1995).

Nigeria: an environmental and public health review,2016,John Kanayochukwu Nduka and Vincent Nwalieji Okafor and Isaac Omoche Odiba,7,Journal of Environmental Protection,04,566,Scientific Research Publishing,Acidic aerosols resulting from gas flaring and refinery operations in the Niger Delta are a serious environmental and public health concern. Several thousand tons of flue gas components (dust particles. SOx. CO and NOx) are released into the atmosphere by flaring billions of cubic meters of natural gas. refining and volatilizing the spilt oil. Heat wave is generated by flaring travels several meters away from flare points. destroying crops. farm lands. exotic species that are hunters delight while causing extinction of fragile soil flora and fuana. The occurrence of acid rain in the region implies that the natural receptors of the area are the final recipient of land and atmospheric pollutants. In effect. the water needs and public health of the populace are greatly impeded. Nitric and sulphuric acids are regarded as the sole contributors of nitrate and sulphate in precipitation influenced by combusted hydrocarbons: fine nitrate aerosols that dissolve in rain water are conversion products of NO2 that arise from flaring. power plants and motor vehicles. Scientific evidence has shown that rain water and surface water quality in the Niger Delta can accentuate the poor health burden. and may be perpetuated through generations unborn. Diagnostic health risk assessment has revealed that drinking nitrate contaminated water may be associated with spontaneous miscarriage. ectopic pregnancy. adult malignant lymphomas. soft tissues sarcomas. cancers and lesions with added health burden associated with heavy metals and other ions. All these pose public health emergency and may significantly entrench health risk for generations to come.

O objetivo desse trabalho foi o de analisar as informações disponíveis na literatura para se obter um conhecimento mais aprofundado dos mecanismos de ação dos aditivos retardadores e aceleradores da pega deste cimento. Da análise dos dados compilados pode-se concluir que os aditivos retardadores agem geralmente de duas maneiras: 1) dificultando o processo de dissolução do cimento. por meio da formação de barreiras insolúveis ao redor das suas partículas e 2) favorecendo a formação de hidratos mais solúveis. o que aumenta o tempo necessário para que se inicie a precipitação. Por outro lado. os aditivos aceleradores de pega podem atuar favorecendo a formação de hidratos menos solúveis. diminuindo assim o tempo necessário para a precipitação ou ainda pela formação de núcleos iniciadores do processo de crescimento dos cristais dos hidratos. A análise destas informações leva a constatação de que a ação de alguns aditivos retardadores e aceleradores ocorre em estágios distintos no processo de hidratação do CAC.

This redox process was ascribed to the RuIII/RuII charge transfer. For cast films the redox pair was poorly defined. with Epa = 0.27 V and Epc = 0.20 V. The reason for the difference lies in the phase separation and formation of aggregates onto ITO for the cast film. in contrast to the LB film.

This information was then correlated with the polymeric properties of the materials (glass transition temperature (Tg). molecular weight characteristics. and thermal stability) for a series of selectively and progressively derivatized softwood kraft lignin samples. Softwood kraft lignin was highly susceptible to thermally induced reactions that caused its molecular characteristics to be severely altered with the concomitant formation of irreversible cross-linking. However. by fully methylating the phenolic OH groups from within the structure of softwood kraft lignin. the thermal stability of these materials was dramatically enhanced and their Tg reduced.

This noble goal can be achieved by adding carbon onto lignin via propargylation.

This article demonstrates that properly installed propargyl groups of an acetone soluble kraft lignin (ASKL) fraction can be thermally polymerized to high molecular weights in a controlled manner. In order to create single component chain extended softwood kraft lignin systems for carbon fiber applications. one needs to regulate the amount and the positioning of the propargyl groups on the lignin.

The first section of this chapter describes the three-pot synthesis of a perfluoroarylated bis(cyclopentadienone) monomer. The synthesis begins with the previously reported substitution reaction of decafluorobiphenyl and sodium cyclopentadienide. To the resulting 4.4'-octafluorobiphenylene-linked bis(cyclopentadiene). six perfluoro-4-tolyl groups (three on each of the two cyclopentadienyl moieties) are attached by nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions. The remaining ring methylenes are subjected to a selenium dioxide-catalyzed oxidation to obtain the desired bis(cyclopentadienone) monomer. The next part of this chapter describes the polymerization of the perfluoroarylated bis-(cyclopentadienone) monomer and bis(4-ethynylphenyl) ether. The reaction affords an oligomer (Mn ~ 14.000 g/mol according to size-exclusion chromatographic analysis) that is soluble in several solvents and that decomposes above about 300°C according to thermogravimetric analysis. The second chapter of this dissertation describes a novel method to oxidize per-fluoroarylated cyclopentadiene compounds to the corresponding ketones using catalytic selenium dioxide and stoichiometric hydrogen peroxide. The first part of this chapter shows the synthesis of some perfluoroarylated cyclopentadiene substrates. while the second part of the chapter explores the oxidation of these compounds along with other perfluoroarylated cyclopentadienes already available within our research group.

Emphasis is placed on the molecular design and the experimental outcomes in terms of target-induced fluorescence enhancements and input/output wavelengths. The handling of single targets takes up a major fraction of the review. but the extension to multiple targets is also illustrated.

The need to monitor these on a local level has recently been realized with the emergence of low cost tabletop Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) with high magnification possibilities offering a quick and easy way of analyzing PM down to 300 nanometres in size. The ease of use of these instruments makes them suitable for an untrained person to routinely monitor elemental constituents of individual particles and possibly linking them to inherent health risks. In this study particles from outdoor air were collected onto Polyamide filters and analyzed using tabletop SEM utilizing Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) to determine and identify their chemical composition. 341 particles were successfully characterized and classified in relation to their chemical identity and origin.

1184371,Particulate airborne impurities,2013,Kai Wilkinson,2013,,27,,,The cumulative effects of air pollutants are of principal concern in research on environmental protection in Sweden. Post-industrial society has imposed many limits on emitted air pollutants. yet the number of reports on the negative effects from them is increasing. largely due to human activity in the form of industrial emissions and increased traffic flows. Rising concerns over the health effects from airborne particulate matter (PM) stem from in vitro. in vivo. and cohort studies revealing effects of mostly negative nature.  Full insight into the health effects from PM can only be achieved through practical investigation of the mode of toxicity from distinct types of particles and requires techniques for their identification. monitoring. and the production of model fractions for health studies. To this effect. comprehensive collection and chemical analysis of particulates at the origin of emission was performed in order to provide clearer insight into the nature of the particulates at exposure and add detail to aid risk assessment. Methods of capturing particles and analyzing their chemical nature were devised using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).  Furthermore. taking the approach of in vitro cytotoxicity testing. nanoparticles of types typical to automotive emissions. were synthesized and extensively characterized using SEM-EDS.

TADF devices are also hampered by insufficient operational stability. In this paper. we report the design. synthesis. and evaluation of new TADF molecules possessing a sterically twisted skeleton by interlocking donor and acceptor moieties through a C–C bond. Compared to C–N-bond TADF molecules. such as CPT2. the C–C-bond TADF molecules showed a large dihedral angle increase by more than 30 times and a singlet–triplet energy-gap decrease to less than 0.22 eV because of the steric hindrance caused by the direct C–C bond connection. With the introduction of a dibenzofuran core structure. devices comprising BMK-T317 and BMK-T318 exhibited a magnificent display performance. especially their external quantum efficiencies. which were as high as 19.9% and 18.8%. respectively. Moreover. the efficiency roll-off of BMK-T318 improved significantly (26.7%). These results indicate that stability of the material can be expected through the reduction of their singlet–triplet splitting and the precise adjustment of dihedral angles between the donor–acceptor skeletons.

Bioinformatic analysis has revealed 99.5% gene homology between the two species pointing towards a large coherence in the secondary metabolite production. In this study we report on the first comparison of secondary metabolite production between the full genome sequenced strains of A. oryzae (RIB40) and A. flavus (NRRL 3357). Surprisingly. the overall chemical profiles of the two strains were mostly very different across 15 growth conditions. Contrary to previous studies we found the aflatrem precursor 13-desoxypaxilline to be a major metabolite from A. oryzae under certain growth conditions. For the first time. we additionally report A. oryzae to produce parasiticolide A and two new analogues hereof. along with four new alkaloids related to the A. flavus metabolites ditryptophenalines and miyakamides.

The RIB40 strain is particularly interesting as it was one of the first genome sequenced Aspergilli together with A. flavus. a prominent food and feed contaminant capable of producing aflatoxin. These species can be perceived as ecotypes. We have analyzed A. oryzae RIB40 and found that the chemical potential could be enhanced significantly under certain conditions. Delicate analysis of their metabolic profiles allow for chemical insight on the transcription level with indications to specific genetic changes.

We here present a method to evaluate the chemical potential of an entire species and select representatives for genome sequencing. The selection criteria for new strains to be sequenced can be manifold. but for studying the functional phenotype. using a metabolome based approach offers a cheap and rapid assessment of critical strains to cover the chemical diversity. We have applied this methodology on the complex A. flavus/A. oryzae group. Though these two species are in principal identical. they represent two different phenotypes. This is clearly presented through a correspondence analysis of selected extrolites. in which the subtle chemical differences are visually dispersed. The results points to a handful of strains. which. if sequenced. will likely enhance our knowledge of the chemical potential of A. flavus/A. oryzae.,True,s1_yYawAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/chemical-rationale-for-selection-of-isolates-for-genome-sequencin,,,,,0,0,0

This number greatly exceeds the number of currently known PKs calling for new approaches for triggering “cryptic” or “silent” genes to see production of compounds not previously observed under laboratory conditions. We therefore decided to challenge our deletion library on eight different complex media. spanning a large variety of alternating carbon and nitrogen sources. vitamins and other nutrients. Comparative UHPLC-DAD analyses indeed revealed that a large number of secondary metabolites were produced by the A. nidulans reference strain on the different media. Careful investigation. also including LC-DAD-HRMS data. has lead to the linking of several known compounds to their PKS genes. For example we have found that a whole series of prenylated PKs such as arugosins and shamixanthones can be linked to the mdpG PK gene cluster. Previously only emodins and monodictyphenone were known gene products of mdpG. Further examples of new links between PK products and genes will be given illustrating the scope of using of diode array detection and electrospray in the negative mode for detection and tentative identification of non reduced polyketides.,True,s1_yYawAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/mapping-of-polyketide-biosynthesis-pathways-in-aspergillus-nidula,,,,,0,0,0

Activating mutations of the N-ras and K-ras oncogenes occur with a high frequency in myeloma and. therefore. may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. To study the role of N-ras-activating mutations in the regulation of myeloma tumor growth. we introduced a constitutively active N-ras cDNA containing a glutamine to arginine (CAA-CGA) amino acid substitution at codon 61 into the interleukin 6 (IL-6)-dependent myeloma cell line ANBL6. Expression of the mutant N-ras cDNA resulted in significant IL-6-independent growth. as well as augmentation of growth at suboptimal concentrations of IL-6. The IL-6-independent growth pattern was not the result of activation of autocrine IL-6 production in the mutant N-ras-expressing population because neutralizing antibodies to the IL-6 receptor and to IL-6 had no effect on the rate of DNA …,True,fEWgH9gAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,115,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/55/16/3640.short,3914351258159044853,/scholar?cites=3914351258159044853,,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/55/16/3640.full.pdf,0,0,0

Toward this end. micro/nanomotors are emerging as attractive tools to improve the removal of various pollutants. The micro/nanomotors either are designed with functional materials in their structure or are modified to target pollutants. The active motion of these motors improves the mixing and mass transfer. greatly enhancing the rate of various remediation processes. Their motion can also be used as an indicator of the presence of a pollutant for sensing purposes.

Ordered mesoporous metal oxides show large surface area and good light harvesting. resulting in efficient catalysts for many photocatalytic applications. With this in mind. a new highly active photocatalyst. La doped mesoporous WO3. was examined. The production of methanol over WO3/La was approximately 2 times higher than that of pure WO3 while the CO2 rates were significantly decreased. resulting in higher methanol selectivity. This improvement was mainly due to lanthanum contributing to maintaining the mesoporous structure during calcination treatment and increasing the generation of OH groups on the surface of WO3.

Effect of pH and ionic strength,2000,Meredith SS Curren and Robert C Burk,45,Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data,5,746-750,American Chemical Society,Partitioning of pentachlorophenol (PCP) between water and CO2 was investigated to determine the effects of pH and ionic strength on the value of the distribution coefficient. K. Decreasing the pH or increasing the ionic strength increased the value of K. The distribution coefficient was larger than that predicted by considering the extent of hydrolysis of the solute in the aqueous phase. However. impedance measurements suggest that negligible concentrations of ions exist in the CO2 phase. Together. these two facts suggest that the aqueous phase hydrolysis equilibrium is shifted toward unhydrolyzed solute as PCP partitions to CO2. The value of K was smaller than the ratio of solubilities of the solute in the two phases. likely due to the effect of solute composition on the solute activity coefficients in each phase.

The recent disclosure of several thousand compounds active in vitro against the erythrocyte stage of Plasmodium falciparum has been a major breakthrough. though converting these hits into new medicines challenges current strategies. A new in vivo screening concept was evaluated as a strategy to increase the speed and efficiency of drug discovery projects in malaria. The new in vivo screening concept was developed based on human disease parameters. i.e. parasitemia in the peripheral blood of patients on hospital admission and parasite reduction ratio (PRR). which were allometrically down-scaled into P. berghei-infected mice. Mice with an initial parasitemia (P0) of 1.5% were treated orally for two consecutive days and parasitemia measured 24 h after the second dose.

NiFe 2 O 4 (NFO) may be a promising candidate for future spin-based applications. Recent demonstration of spin-Seeback effect in magnetic insulators indicates that important new phenomena may be discovered in such materials. Unfortunately. density functional theory cannot give a full account of its properties; most notably. LDA calculations find it to be metallic. LDA+ U yields an insulator but underestimates the band gap. The recently-implemented screened hybrid functionals method (HSE06) represents only a moderate increase in computational effort compared to traditional DFT. This method allows one to modify the PBE-approximated exchange potential with a portion of the Hartree-Fock exchange. We present LDA.

1184690,Air pollution from solid fuels.,2011,Sukesh Narayan Sinha and PK Nag,,,,46-52,In: Nriagu JO (Ed.) (Elsevier) encyclopedia of Environmental Health,Any alteration in the physical. chemical. and biological attributes of air causing adverse effects on human and other organisms is termed as air pollution. The substances contributing to air pollution are known as air pollutants. They can be natural or manmade. Pollutants can also be classified as either primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are the result of direct processes like volcanic eruptions. carbon mono-oxide from automobiles or sulfur dioxide from industries. Secondary pollutants are the result of the interaction of primary pollutants with air. An important example of a secondary pollutant is solid biomass fuel which includes such as coal. charcoal. wood. agricultural wastes. animal dung. shrubs. grass. straw. and so forth. Greater than 80% of the people living in urban areas have exposure to bad quality air that exceeds the World Health Organization (WHO) limits. Even though all the countries in the world are affected. it causes greater impact in low income developing countries. The latest Urban quality database shows that 98% of cities (3000 cities in 103 countries) in low and middle income countries with more than 100.000 inhabitants do not meet WHO air quality guidelines where as in high income countries it is only 56%. Declining in the urban quality air causes the risk of stroke. heart disease. lung cancer and chronic and acute respiratory diseases like asthma (Source: WHO Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution. 2016). Concerns have been raised to control air pollution in the developing as well as the developed world.

Therefore the insecticides/pesticides and herbicides have been used in India for agriculture setting. In this connection a sensitive method for the quantification of 5 pesticides in drinking water samples to the µgL–1 level has been developed. The paper also describes the effect of dissociation energy on ion formation and sensitivity of pesticides in water samples. The structure. ion formations. distribution of base peak and fragmentation schemes were correlated with the different dissociation energies. The new ion was obtained at different mass to charge ratio. which was the characteristic ion peak of targeted pesticide. Additionally. a simple solvent lyophilization followed by selective analysis using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was used. This method was accurate (≥98%) as it possesses limits of detection in the 6 - 38 ngL–1 range. and the percentage relative standard deviations are less than 8.62% at the low µgL–1 end of the method’s linear range. The percentage recovery of all the pesticides at the 0.1 µgL–1 levels of detection ranges from 92% - 104%. This method was used for the quantification of pesticides in water samples collected from different parts from urban city of Hyderabad. India. In this study. 13 water samples were analyzed in which all samples showed detectable level of the malathion and alachlor.

Here we present the path for the construction of machine learned molecular force fields by discussing the hierarchical pathway from generating the dataset of reference calculations to the construction of the machine learning model. and the validation of the physics generated by the model. We will use the symmetrized gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) framework due to its ability to reconstruct complex high-dimensional potential-energy surfaces (PES) with high precision even when using just a few hundreds of molecular conformations for training. The data efficiency of the sGDML model allows using reference atomic forces computed with high-level wavefunction-based approaches. such as the $ gold $$ standard $ coupled cluster method with single. double. and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD (T)). We demonstrate that the flexible nature of the sGDML framework captures local and non-local electronic interactions (eg H-bonding. lone pairs. steric repulsion. changes in hybridization states (eg $ sp^ 2\rightleftharpoons sp^ 3$). $ n\to\pi^* $ interactions. and proton transfer) without imposing any restriction on the nature of interatomic potentials. The analysis of sGDML models trained for different molecular structures at different levels of theory (eg density functional theory and CCSD (T)) provides empirical evidence that a higher level of theory generates a smoother PES.

One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs). with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them.

In vitro incubations confirmed that soy proteins are excellent substrates for transglutaminase. especially when denatured. The macroscopic effects resulting from the addition of transglutaminase were compared to changes at the microstructural and molecular level. Treatment produced a firmer tofu. with a significantly increased fracture force. Examination by SEM showed a change in the matrix structure. with transglutaminase resulting in a finer-stranded. uniform network that accounted for the increase in fracture force. At the molecular level. little. if any. cross-linking occurred within the tofu matrix in situ. This suggests that the change in functional properties afforded by addition of transglutaminase to tofu is due to a side reaction of the enzyme. for example hydrolysis of glutamine residues. rather than its cross-linking …,True,ZAc1oyYAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,70,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814607002075,3631896658197586012,/scholar?cites=3631896658197586012,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46897096/j.foodchem.2007.02.02620160629-24709-16fe131.pdf,0,0,0

At 2 mM glutaraldehyde. the fracture force was increased if the reagent was added before soymilk boiling. but decreased if it was added after boiling. when more cross-linking was observed due to the denaturation of the proteins. The fracture forces and microstructures are hard to rationalise in terms of cross-linking. suggesting that other factors. such as non-cross-linking protein glycation. may be responsible for the observed changes.

The yield of carrageenan relies very much on the extraction method. Different carrageenan extraction methods on Eucheuma cottonii harvested from Sabah Coast were investigated. Several extraction method ie traditional-boiling. fungi-treated and cellulose-treated was studied according to the optimized conditions (pH. temperature and duration) stated by previous studies. The aim of the study is to identify the best extraction method to be used to obtain high yield of carrageenan. The highest yield was obtained through cellulase-treated extraction (45%) followed by traditional boiling (37.5%) and the lowest were observed with fungal treatment (37%). The viscosity of carrageenan in cellulase-treated method is better than fungi-treatment but still lower than commercial and traditional method. The enzymes produced by A. niger might be cutting the long chain into several smaller fragments which makes the carrageenan with low viscosity. Secondly. the extracted carrageenan might not be pure. It may have other cellular impurities which also make it inferior to standard carrageenan.

This sequence comprises a rhodium-catalyzed diazocoupling that provides >9:1 selectivity for heterocoupling of two diazoesters and a reduction mediated by an ene-reductase (ER). which occurs in up to 99% enantiomeric excess (ee). The high yield and enantioselectivity of this system result from the preferential generation of an (E)-alkene from the diazo coupling reaction and selective reduction of the (E)-alkene in a mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers by the ER. Screening of a panel of ERs revealed that OPR1 from Lycopersicum esculentum catalyzes the reduction of bulky tert-butyl or benzyl esters to afford chiral diesters that are poised for orthogonal reactions at the two distinct ester units of the product.

Subsequently. I spent three years as a post-doctoral fellow with Richard Taylor in York whose studies have pioneered many of the recent synthetic applications of the RBR. Now. 70 years after the initial disclosure of this reaction and with the Victoria University Organic Synthesis group beginning to apply the RBR in some of its synthetic endeavours. it seemed appropriate to provide some context for this fascinating and useful reaction in the modern setting.

This includes a wide range of bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. for which synthetic efficiency is of the utmost importance [1]. The evolution of these alkynylation methodologies has spanned a plethora of different catalysts. reagents. and substrates. including the investigation of more than a dozen different transition metals [2]. Ultimately. these studies have provided a wealth of insight into the reactivity of alkynyl-metal complexes and produced a number of different methods for the chemo-and enantioselective preparation of propargylic alcohols.

1184807,Transition Metal Catalyzed Linchpin-Based Strategies in Natural Product Synthesis: Synthesis of Asteriscunolide D. Aspergillide B and the Core of Labillarides EH,2013,Mark J Bartlett,,,,,Victoria University of Wellington,The construction of complex molecular architectures in a facile and efficient manner remains an overarching goal for the chemical sciences. The development of synthetic linchpins. simple compounds that are used to join complex molecular fragments together. represents a powerful method for improving synthetic efficiency. A major challenge associated with linchpin-based synthetic strategies is the development of chemoselective and atom economic reactions that enable late-stage introduction of the linchpin compound. Chiral propargylic alcohols are versatile synthetic intermediates and their preparation enables entry into a variety of alkyne-based linchpin strategies. Continued optimization of Zn-ProPhenol-catalyzed alkyne addition has led to the development of practical and general conditions for the asymmetric alkynylation of aldehydes. This methodology operates with relatively low catalyst loading and can avoid the use of excess alkyne and dialkylzinc reagents. The total synthesis of asteriscunolide D was completed in just nine steps using a Zn- ProPhenol-catalyzed asymmetric alkynylation and Ru-catalyzed alkene-alkyne coupling. Other highlights of this protecting-group-free synthesis include the use of a thionium-induced cyclization to form the challenging 11-membered humulene ring. At the core of this succinct and selective synthetic strategy is the use of methyl propiolate as a strategic linchpin. In just two steps. three new bonds were formed to atoms derived from methyl propiolate and this ultimately enabled the construction of this structurally challenging natural product.

While the overall starch synthase (SS) reaction is known. the functional differences between the five SS classes are poorly understood. Much of our knowledge comes from analyzing mutant plants with altered SS activities. but the resulting data are often difficult to interpret as a result of pleitropic effects. competition between enzymes. overlaps in enzyme activity and disruption of multi-enzyme complexes. Here we provide a detailed biochemical study of the activity of all five classes of SSs in barley endosperm.

Our results define the mode of action of each SS class in unprecedented detail; we analyze their substrate selection. temperature dependence and stability. substrate affinity and temporal abundance during barley development. Our results are at variance with some generally accepted ideas about starch biosynthesis and might lead to the reinterpretation of results obtained in planta.

These phospholipid microfibers exhibited antioxidant properties which increased after the encapsulation of both curcumin and vanillin. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and the total phenolic content (TPC) of curcumin/phospholipid and vanillin/phospholipid microfibers remained stable over time at different temperatures (refrigerated. ambient) and pressures (vacuum. ambient). 1 H-NMR confirmed the chemical stability of both encapsulated curcumin and vanillin within phospholipid fibers. Release studies in aqueous media revealed that the phenolic bioactives were released mainly due to swelling of the phospholipid fiber matrix over time. The above studies confirm the efficacy of electrospun phospholipid microfibers as encapsulation and antioxidant systems.

At the heart of dynamic combinatorial chemistry are the reversible reactions that enable the exchange of building blocks between library members in dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs) ensuring thermodynamic control over the system. If more than one reversible reaction operates in a single dynamic combinatorial library. the complexity of the system increases dramatically. and so does its possible applications. One can imagine two reversible reactions that operate simultaneously or two reversible reactions that operate independently. Both these scenarios have advantages and disadvantages. In this contribution. we show how disulfide exchange and boronic ester transesterification can function simultaneous in dynamic combinatorial libraries under appropriate conditions. We describe the detailed studies necessary to establish suitable reaction conditions and highlight the analytical techniques appropriate to study this type of system.

Mg and Ca. a process of interest to the proposed El Boleo copper/cobalt project. Previous work on the chemical stability of this system had revealed the potential for rapid degradation of LIX®63 oxime (‘oxime’) at high temperature (40. 50 °C) when extracting cobalt and zinc from El Boleo solutions. The present study under extract conditions at 30 °C found increased manganese loading. achieved by increasing operating pH from 4.5 to 6.0. facilitated increased rates of oxime degradation and ‘irreversible’ loading of cobalt. This cobalt was able to be reductively stripped using zinc metal. yielding anti oxime and ‘keto-oxime’.

Argentina at latitude 55°S reveal a large degree of variability among corresponding months of different years over the period from September 1990 through April 1998. The magnitude and wavelength dependence of year‐to‐year changes in monthly spectral UV‐B irradiation are consistent with expectations based on the behavior of column ozone and cloudiness. When combined with satellite measurements of column ozone. a regression model fit to the ground‐based data set allows estimates of monthly UV‐B irradiation over a time frame of two decades. 1978–1998. during several months of the year.

While both 3 and 4 conglomerate into tetramers. there are significant differences in the packing of those tetrameric units. In both 3 and 4 the tetrameric units arrange in a hexagonal pattern. but in 3 the units adopt alternating orientations leading to severe interlocking of the alkyl nitrate groups. This ultimately leads to a 2-fold decrease in the mechanical sensitivity of 4 relative to 3 and suggests that utilizing anion size may lead to more efficient packing arrangements and reduced mechanical sensitivity in energetic salts.,True,k_IJB-4AAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,8,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.7b00159,8706949512475062055,/scholar?cites=8706949512475062055,,,0,0,0

TNT crystallizes in a monoclinic lattice (space group P2 1/a). and our previous X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements at room temperature suggested a phase transition to orthorhombic (space group Pca2 1) at~ 20 GPa. In this work. we have performed in-situ synchrotron XRD and vibrational spectroscopy measurements along the room temperature isotherm to investigate phase stabilities up to 18 GPa. While our Raman spectroscopy measurements indicate spectral changes at~ 2 GPa. careful XRD measurements reveal that the monoclinic phase persists up to 10 GPa.,True,k_IJB-4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,7,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/500/5/052006/meta,5479255559257957186,/scholar?cites=5479255559257957186,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/500/5/052006/pdf,0,0,0

Numerous studies have sought to connect various physical and chemical properties of the energetic molecules and materials to their measured impact sensitivities. Wenograd in the early 1960s demonstrated that there is a strong dependency of the drop-heights on the critical temperatures required for explosives to undergo prompt reactions.

Macro- and microscale studies have concluded that multiple physical and chemical factors affect sensitivity. both intermolecular and intramolecular. Stereoisomers are molecular pairs with the same bond connectivity but differing spatial arrangement of those bonds. and in certain cases can exhibit vastly different chemical and physical properties. Herein we report the synthesis of stereoisomers of erythritol tetranitrate (ETN) and the reported stereoisomers mannitol hexanitrate (MHN) and sorbitol hexanitrate (SHN). Isomers of ETN and MHN had altered physical properties such as melting point. state of matter. and crystal structure.

EUR 29282 EN,,,,Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a large group of chemically related substances many of which are known carcinogens. To minimise human exposure there are already several pieces of EU legislation which limit their presence in certain food products. as well as in water and ambient air. Under the REACH regulation (EC 1907/2006 Annex XVII. Entry 50). eight priority PAHs have for some time been restricted in extender oils used in tyres. Although not added deliberately to consumer products. PAHs can still be present as impurities. An amendment of the above mentioned legislation (Regulation EU 1272/2013) establishes content limits for the eight PAHs of 0.5 mg kg-1 for plastic and rubber components of toys/childcare articles. and 1 mg kg-1 for all other consumer articles. in direct and prolonged. or short-term repetitive. contact with the skin or oral cavity.In May 2016 DG JRC and DG GROW signed an Administrative Arrangement (AA 34003) known as the STANPAHs project. The main objective of this contract was for the JRC to provide scientific support in the implementation and potential amendment of the restriction on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. in particular concerning paragraphs 5 and 6 of entry 50 of Annex XVII to the REACH legislation. The main objectives of the project were: a) to gain a better understanding of the migration behaviour of certain PAHs in plastic and rubber components of articles. and b) to develop a reliable methodology to determine PAH migration from these matrices. under conditions simulating. to the best possible extent. dermal contact (including the oral cavity).,True,IYXESugAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,6,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/160035120.pdf,3224568806354842626,/scholar?cites=3224568806354842626,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/160035120.pdf,0,0,0

In this work. we demonstrate the converse piezoelectric effect in single heptahelicene-derived molecules on the Ag(111) surface using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and total energy density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The force–distance spectroscopy acquired over a wide range of bias voltages reveals a linear shift of the tip–sample distance at which the contact between the molecule and tip apex is established. We demonstrate that this effect is caused by the bias-induced deformation of the spring-like scaffold of the helical polyaromatic molecules.

Important examples of what this technique can yield to biological sciences are the mechanistic insights on protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. When interactions of proteins are probed at the single-molecule level. the proteins or their substrates are often immobilized on a glass surface. which allows for a long-term observation. This immobilization scheme may introduce unwanted surface artifacts. Therefore. it is essential to passivate the glass surface to make it inert. Surface coating using polyethylene glycol (PEG) stands out for its high performance in preventing proteins from non-specifically interacting with a glass surface. However. the polymer coating procedure is difficult. due to the complication arising from a series of surface treatments and the stringent requirement that a surface needs to be free of any fluorescent molecules at the end of the procedure. Here. we provide a robust protocol with step-by-step instructions. It covers surface cleaning including piranha etching. surface functionalization with amine groups. and finally PEG coating. To obtain a high density of a PEG layer. we introduce a new strategy of treating the surface with PEG molecules over two rounds. which remarkably improves the quality of passivation. We provide representative results as well as practical advice for each critical step so that anyone can achieve the high quality surface passivation.,True,Ijph0GsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,124,https://www.jove.com/t/50549/surface-passivation-for-single-molecule-protein-studies,7732214514915373324,/scholar?cites=7732214514915373324,,https://www.jove.com/t/50549/surface-passivation-for-single-molecule-protein-studies,0,0,0

Virgin olive oil (VOO) is obtained from the olive fruits of Olea europaea L. with only mechanical means. and has nutritional and sensory characteristics that make it a unique and basic ingredient of the Mediterranean diet. These highly nutritional and sensory properties of olive oil are attributed mainly to the presence of minor functional components that other seed oils often lack. such as phenolic compounds. tocopherols. chlorophylls. and carotenoids (Kiritsakis. 1990; Cicerale et al.. 2009). The phenolic composition of olive oil and its concentration depend mainly on the cultivar and geographic origin as well as the degree of ripening of the olive fruit.

In general terms. all foods are functional because they provide the nutrients necessary for a healthy diet. So what are the components that functional foods have beyond their nutrition value? What is the definition of functional foods? What scientific research is needed to validate health claims for functional foods? This book will provide answers to all of these questions. It is important for scientists to have the opportunities to study the relationship between a food type or a food active component and the improved state of health or reduction of diseases.

1185199,Introductory Chapter: Functional Foods,2018,Vasiliki Lagouri,,,,,IntechOpen,The first definition of functional foods has been established in Japan. In 1991. the Japanese law entered the work definition “foods for specified health use”(FOSHU) which allowed the first health claims on the food labeling. The FOSHU can be foods which exhibit health effect. used as foods in a diet. and are in the form of foods not as supplements [1].A second definition of functional foods developed by the “Functional Food Science in Europe”(FUFOSE):“Functional food is a food with certain beneficial effects on one or more target functions in the body beyond the basic nutritional effects with a result the improved health state and well being or reduction of risk of diseases. It is consumed as a part of a normal diet and is not used in the form of pill or capsule or any other form of dietary supplement”[2]. Recently. the Functional Food Center (FFC) introduced a new definition for functional foods as:“Natural or processed foods that contains known or unknown biologically-active compounds; which. in defined. effective non-toxic amounts. provide a clinically proven and documented health benefit for the prevention. management. or treatment of chronic disease”[3]. In this definition. first functional foods can be natural or processed. Second. bioactive compounds. which are considered to be the source of the functionality of the foods. are secondary metabolites occur in food usually in small amounts that act synergistically to benefit health.

The presence of active components in spices has been demonstrated over the last 30 years. Extracts obtained by food grade solvents were mainly examined for non volatile phenolic constituents. while less attention was given to the essential oil fraction and the extent to which this fraction may contribute to the antioxidant effect of the spice. In this paper. various essential oils were screened for their antioxidant activity by measuring bleaching of beta—carotene in the coupled oxidation of beta—carotene and linoleie acid.

While thiazole bithiophene azo dyes exhibit high switching speeds between the two isomers. but limited interconversion. for benzothiazole and substituted thiadiazole bithiophene azo dyes the switching between the two photoisomers can be performed in 3 s with a significant conversion of the trans-isomer to the thermal unstable cis-isomer (19–21%) and therefore a notable variation of the visible spectrum is observed.,True,ZqxBSHgAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,20,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403912010118,2616108458104199142,/scholar?cites=2616108458104199142,,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/21923/1/Tetrahedron%20Letters%202012.pdf,0,0,0

Stille and decarboxylative coupling). The synthesis of compounds 5 via the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction produced the title compounds in better yields than the other coupling reactions. while. decarboxylative coupling resulted in the lower yields. UV–visible and 1H NMR studies confirm the existence of significant intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor pyrrole heterocycle to the acceptor group and a high polarizability of the whole π-conjugated systems.

Carbon dioxide is generated as a byproduct in the reactor and must be separated in order to produce the pure olefin. This step is commonly achieved by amine scrubbing. in which a significant amount of energy is consumed for regenerating the amine. In this contribution. a hybrid system employing gas separation membranes and absorption is modeled and simulated in order to carry out preliminary engineering design and economic evaluations to assess the feasibility of applying this process on industrial scale.

Conventional treatments. such as chemotherapy. are generally expensive. highly toxic and lack efficiency. Cancer chemoprevention using phytochemicals is emerging as a promising approach for the treatment of early carcinogenic processes.(−)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major bioactive constituent in green tea with numerous health benefits including anti-cancer activity. which has been intensively studied. Besides its potential for chemoprevention. EGCG has also been shown to synergize with common anti-cancer agents. which makes it a suitable adjuvant in chemotherapy. However. limitations in terms of stability and bioavailability have hampered its application in clinical settings. Nanotechnology may have an important role in improving the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of EGCG. Indeed. several studies have already reported the use of nanoparticles as delivery vehicles of EGCG for cancer therapy. The aim of this article is to discuss the EGCG molecule and its associated health benefits. particularly its anti-cancer activity and provide an overview of the studies that have employed nanotechnology strategies to enhance EGCG’s properties and potentiate its anti-tumoral activity.

The role. efficacy and membrane interaction of antioxidants is still unclear. requiring further understanding of molecular interaction. Hence. the objective of this work was to evaluate the interaction between antioxidants (α-tocopherol and its aqueous soluble analog Trolox) and the monolayer formed by phosphatidylcholine molecules at air/liquid interface upon peroxidation conditions. promoted by peroxyl radicals from thermal decomposition of 2.2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) (AAPH). The interaction with three different monolayers. containing (i) 1.2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC). (ii) DDPC + α-linolenic acid. or (iii) egg yolk l-α-phosphatidylcholine (EPC). was ascertain by surface pressure (π)–molecular area (A) isotherms and by monitoring monolayer features …,True,CPGZsisAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,13,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776513004207,17211279294458322449,/scholar?cites=17211279294458322449,,,0,0,0
1185355,EGCG intestinal absorption and oral bioavailability enhancement using folic acid-functionalized nanostructured lipid carriers,2019,Andreia Granja and Ana Rute Neves and Célia T Sousa and Marina Pinheiro and Salette Reis,5,Heliyon,7,e02020,Elsevier,This work aimed to develop folic acid-functionalized nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) loading epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to increase its oral bioavailability. An active targeting strategy was used and these nanoparticles (NPs) were fully characterized. The NP's effect on Caco-2 cell viability was evaluated and the apparent permeability (Papp) on a Caco-2 cell monolayer was determined. The results demonstrated that the developed NPs exhibited adequate physicochemical characteristics for oral administration and were found to be biocompatible with epithelial Caco-2 cells. Further. folic acid-functionalized EGCG-loaded NLC significantly increased EGCG transport across the intestinal barrier. promoting a 1.8- fold increase in its apparent permeability (Papp). Taken together. these results support that the developed NLC can be used as a promising carrier for safer and efficient management of several …,True,CPGZsisAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,12,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844019356804,10157487204540899327,/scholar?cites=10157487204540899327,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844019356804,0,0,0
