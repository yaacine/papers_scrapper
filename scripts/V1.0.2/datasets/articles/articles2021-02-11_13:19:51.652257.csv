115197,Signaling from Rho to the actin cytoskeleton through protein kinases ROCK and LIM-kinase,1999,Midori Maekawa and Toshimasa Ishizaki and Shuken Boku and Naoki Watanabe and Akiko Fujita and Akihiro Iwamatsu and Takashi Obinata and Kazumasa Ohashi and Kensaku Mizuno and Shuh Narumiya,285,Science,5429,895-898,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The actin cytoskeleton undergoes extensive remodeling during cell morphogenesis and motility. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho regulates such remodeling. but the underlying mechanisms of this regulation remain unclear. Cofilin exhibits actin-depolymerizing activity that is inhibited as a result of its phosphorylation by LIM-kinase. Cofilin was phosphorylated in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells during lysophosphatidic acid–induced. Rho-mediated neurite retraction. This phosphorylation was sensitive to Y-27632. a specific inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinase ROCK. ROCK. which is a downstream effector of Rho. did not phosphorylate cofilin directly but phosphorylated LIM-kinase. which in turn was activated to phosphorylate cofilin. Overexpression of LIM-kinase in HeLa cells induced the formation of actin stress fibers in a Y-27632–sensitive manner.

However. the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton during synaptic plasticity and its in vivo function remain unclear. Here we used an in vivo dentate gyrus LTP model to show that LTP induction is associated with actin cytoskeletal reorganization characterized by a long-lasting increase in F-actin content within dendritic spines.

Using a recombinant human HGF affinity column. we have analyzed the effects of various specific chemical and enzymatic modifications/depolymerizations of HS on its affinity in order to elucidate the polysaccharide structural determinants.

In our previous study. we demonstrated that Gas6 specifically binds to phos phatidylserine(PS) and links Axl-expressing cells to the PS-coated surface. In this study. to further understand the biological role of the interaction of Gas6 with PS. we exam ined the effect of Gas6 on the uptake of PS liposomes by macrophages. In vitro phagocy tosis studies showed that Gas6 enhanced the uptake of PS liposomes approximately threefold and that the interaction of Gas6 with the surface of macrophages was essen tial for this enhancement. Analyses of the mechanism of the uptake of PS liposome sug gested that Gas6 interacts with PS liposome via its N-terminal Gla domain and with macrophages via its C-terminal domain. Like that of PS liposomes. the uptake of apop totic cells by macrophages was also enhanced. approximately twofold. in the presence of Gas6. These findings suggest that Gas6 may help phagocytic cells recognize cells with PS exposed on their surfaces. which is considered to be one of the mechanisms for clearing away dying cells. Thus.

Using as a probe a cDNA fragment of human LIMK. we isolated from a rat brain cDNA library cDNA clones encoding two distinct protein kinases (termed LIMK-1 and LIMK-2) related to human LIMK. LIMK-1 shares with human LIMK 95% of the total 647 amino acids and is probably a rat equivalent of human LIMK.

Ltd,Primary cilia are antenna‐like sensory organelles protruding from the plasma membrane. Defects in ciliogenesis cause diverse genetic disorders. NDR2 was identified as the causal gene for a canine ciliopathy. early retinal degeneration. but its role in ciliogenesis remains unknown. Ciliary membranes are generated by transport and fusion of Golgi‐derived vesicles to the pericentrosome. a process requiring Rab11‐mediated recruitment of Rabin8. a GDP–GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Rab8. and subsequent Rab8 activation and Rabin8 binding to Sec15. a component of the exocyst that mediates vesicle tethering. This study shows that NDR2 phosphorylates Rabin8 at Ser‐272 and defects in this phosphorylation impair preciliary membrane assembly and ciliogenesis. resulting in accumulation of Rabin8‐/Rab11‐containing vesicles at the pericentrosome.

To uncover the mechanism of their migration. we analyzed actin waves. which translocate actin and actin-associated proteins along neuronal axons toward the growth cones. We found that arrays of actin filaments constituting waves undergo directional assembly and disassembly. with their polymerizing ends oriented toward the axonal tip. and that the lateral side of the filaments is mechanically anchored to the adhesive substrate. A combination of live-cell imaging. molecular manipulation. force measurement. and mathematical modeling revealed that wave migration is driven by directional assembly and disassembly of actin filaments and their anchorage to the substrate.

115338,Cisplatin.,1999,Elizabeth E Trimmer and John M Essigmann,34,,,191-211,,Cisplatin is a widely used anti-cancer drug that is exceptionally effective against testicular cancer. trans-DDP. the geometric isomer of cisplatin. is ineffective as a chemotherapeutic agent. The anti-tumour activity of cisplatin is generally attributed to its formation of DNA adducts. both intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks. which induce structural distortions in DNA. The DNA adducts of cisplatin are thought to mediate its cytotoxic effects by inhibiting DNA replication and transcription and. ultimately. by inducing programmed cell death. or apoptosis. The adducts of both cis-and trans-DDP are removed from DNA by the nucleotide-excision-repair pathway. Cellular proteins possessing certain DNA-binding motifs. including the HMG domain. bind selectively to DNA modified by cisplatin. but not to DNA adducts of trans-DDP; evidence suggests a possible role for these proteins in modulating cisplatin cytotoxicity.

The toxicity of cisplatin probably results from its ability to form DNA adducts that inhibit polymerases. Blocked replication represents a particular challenge for tumor cells. which are committed to unremitting division. Recombination provides a mechanism by which replication can proceed despite the presence of lesions and therefore could be significant for managing cisplatin toxicity.Results: Recombination-deficient Escherichia coli mutants were strikingly sensitive to cisplatin when compared with the parental strain. Our data identified both daughter-strand gap and double-strand break recombination pathways as critical for survival following treatment with cisplatin.

A mutational hotspot might be created by preferential lesion formation. decreased lesion repair. or increased misinsertion past the lesion during DNA replication. The respective contribution of these factors might be influenced by the DNA sequence context of the hotspot.Results: As a prelude to addressing the contribution of all possible nearest-neighbor contexts on the replication past O6-methylguanine (m6G) and repair of m6G in vivo. we have devised a mutation frequency (MF) detection strategy on the basis of the properties of type IIs restriction enzymes.

The pKa of the individual hydroxyl moieties in the hydroxyflavones was compared to computer-calculated deprotonation energies. This resulted in a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR). which enables the estimation of pKa values of individual hydroxyl moieties. also in hydroxyflavones for which these pKa values are not available. Comparison of the pKa values to the pH-dependent antioxidant profiles. determined by the TEAC assay. reveals that for various hydroxyflavones the pH-dependent behavior is related to hydroxyl moiety deprotonation. resulting in an increase of the antioxidant potential upon formation of the deprotonated forms.

However. the role of these factors is not well understood. Hence. the aim of this study was to systematically investigate the role of surface charge. oxidative stress and possible involvement of mitochondria in the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon exposure of rat macrophage NR8383 cells to silicon nanoparticles. For this aim highly monodisperse (size 1.6 ± 0.2 nm) and well-characterized Si core nanoparticles (Si NP) were used with a surface charge that depends on the specific covalently bound organic monolayers: positively charged Si NP-NH2. neutral Si NP-N3 and negatively charged Si NP-COOH. Positively charged Si NP-NH2 proved to be more cytotoxic in terms of reducing mitochondrial metabolic activity and effects on phagocytosis than neutral Si NP-N3. while negatively charged Si NP-COOH showed very little or no cytotoxicity. Si NP-NH2 produced the highest level of intracellular ROS. followed by Si NP-N3 and Si NP-COOH; the latter did not induce any intracellular ROS production. A similar trend in ROS production was observed in incubations with an isolated mitochondrial fraction from rat liver tissue in the presence of Si NP. Finally. vitamin E and vitamin C induced protection against the cytotoxicity of the Si NP-NH2 and Si NP-N3. corroborating the role of oxidative stress in the mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of these Si NP.

The European Commission’s REACH legislation stimulates the use of animal-free approaches to obtain information on the toxicity of chemicals. In vitro toxicity tests provide in vitro concentration-response curves for specific target cells. whereas in vivo dose-response curves are regularly used for human risk assessment. The present study shows an approach to predict in vivo dose-response curves for developmental toxicity by combining in vitro toxicity data and in silico kinetic modeling. A physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model was developed. describing the kinetics of four glycol ethers and their embryotoxic alkoxyacetic acid metabolites in rat and man.

The present article presents an overview of these seemingly contradicting health effects and of mechanisms that could be involved in this dualistic mode of action. One mechanism relates to the different ultimate cellular effects of activation of estrogen receptor (ER) α. promoting cell proliferation. and of ERβ. promoting apoptosis. with the major soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein activating especially ERβ. A second mode of action includes the role of epigenetics. including effects of isoflavones on DNA methylation. histone modification and miRNA expression patterns.

The model for the reactive flavin intermediate (C4a-hydroperoxyflavin) bound to PH was constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of the enzyme−substrate complex. A potential energy surface (PES) was calculated as a function of the reaction coordinates for hydroxylation of phenol (on C6) and for proton transfer from phenol (O1) to an active-site base Asp54 (OD1). The results support a reaction mechanism in which phenol is activated through deprotonation by Asp54. after which the phenolate is hydroxylated through an electrophilic aromatic substitution.

The preferential scavenging by Cys over GSH reported in the present study appeared not to provide a basis for detection of thiol-based flavonoid conjugates in biological systems. This is because physiological concentrations of GSH are substantially higher than those of Cys. which was shown to shift the balance of thiol conjugate formation in favor of glutathionyl adduct formation.

In order to examine the effects of quercetin on lipid metabolism. mice received a mild-high-fat diet without (control) or with supplementation of 0.33% (w/w) quercetin for 12 weeks. Gas chromatography and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance were used to quantitatively measure serum lipid profiles. Whole genome microarray analysis of liver tissue was used to identify possible mechanisms underlying altered circulating lipid levels. Body weight. energy intake and hepatic lipid accumulation did not differ significantly between the quercetin and the control group. In serum of quercetin-fed mice. triglycerides (TG) were decreased with 14% (p<0.001) and total poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were increased with 13% (p<0.01). Palmitic acid. oleic acid. and linoleic acid were all decreased by 9–15% (p<0.05) in quercetin-fed mice. Both palmitic acid and oleic acid can be oxidized by omega (ω)-oxidation.

First an inventory was made of botanical compounds that are of possible concern for human health because of their genotoxic and/or carcinogenic properties. In total. 30 botanical compounds were selected and subsequently judged for their actual genotoxic and/or carcinogenic potential. Among the 30 compounds considered. 18 compounds were judged to be both genotoxic and carcinogenic. Interestingly. the majority of these compounds belong to the group of alkenylbenzenes or unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Subsequently. based on available carcinogenicity data and estimated daily human exposure that was determined focusing on the intake from PFS. the Margin of Exposure (MOE) was calculated for the alkenylbenzenes estragole. methyleugenol. safrole and β-asarone. Calculating the MOEs for intake estimates of these alkenylbenzenes from PFS resulted in MOE values that were generally lower than 10.000 and often lower than 100. In some cases the MOE was even below 10 meaning that the estimated daily intake is in the range of dose levels causing malignant tumors in experimental animals. This result indicates that the use of PFS containing the genotoxic carcinogens estragole. methyleugenol. safrole or β-asarone might raise a potential concern for human health and would be of high priority for risk management.,True,lhJNez4AAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C,75,https://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/178088/2/Levels%20of%20Genotoxic%20and%20Carcinogenic%20Compounds%20in%20Plant%20Food%20Supplements%20and%20Associated%20Risk%20Assessment.pdf,9752055106285387446,/scholar?cites=9752055106285387446,,https://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/178088/2/Levels%20of%20Genotoxic%20and%20Carcinogenic%20Compounds%20in%20Plant%20Food%20Supplements%20and%20Associated%20Risk%20Assessment.pdf,0,0,0

The O-methylation of the catechol group in the molecule by catechol O-methyl transferase is one of the important metabolic pathways of flavonoids. In the present study. the consequences of catechol O-methylation for the pH-dependent radical scavenging properties of quercetin and luteolin were characterized both experimentally and theoretically. Comparison of the pKa values to the pH-dependent TEAC profiles reveals that O-methylation not only affects the TEAC as such but also modulates the effect of changing pH on this radical scavenging activity due to an effect on the pKa for deprotonation.

A large number of xenobiotics are as such biologically inert. and many of their toxicological effects are mediated through the formation of ‘active’metabolites. Knowledge on the different pathways by which a chemical can be metabolized into reactive products increases our understanding of the relationship between the chemical structure of xenobiotics and their effects on living systems.

The natural logarithm of the kcat value for the conversion of the phenolic substrates correlates with the calculated energy of the reactive electrons in the highest occupied molecular orbital of the substrate (r= 0.85). This observation supports the hypothesis that at physiological pH (7.6) and 25°C. in the absence of monovalent anions. the nucleophilic attack of the electrons in the highest occupied molecular orbital of the substrate on the C(4a)‐hydroperoxyflavin enzyme intermediate is of major importance in determining the overall rate of catalysis.

A clear correlation between In kcat for the conversion of a series of 4‐hydroxylated substrates and their E(HOMO) leads to the hypothesis that Frontier orbital HOMO characteristics [E(HOMO) and HOMO density on C3] of the substrates are the predominant factor in regulating the fate of a benzoate derivative at the active site of the enzyme. The HOMO characteristics can be used to explain whether a compound will be converted by the enzyme or merely acts as an effector. Furthermore the hypothesis provides quantitative theoretical support for a catalytic mechanism in which the substrate reacts in its dianionic form and for a mechanism in which the electrophilic attack of the C(4a)‐peroxyflavin. or of the hydroxyl radical derived from it. on the …,True,lhJNez4AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,61,https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb16950.x,17060188712914857232,/scholar?cites=17060188712914857232,,https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb16950.x,0,0,0

Mutants of residue Q61 impair the GTPase activity of Ras and are found prominently in human cancers. Yet the mechanism through which Q61 contributes to catalysis has been elusive. It is thought to position the catalytic water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of GTP.

However. a mutation of V266E in the dimer interface activates the protease in the absence of chain cleavage. We show that low concentrations of the pseudo-activated procaspase-3 kill mammalian cells rapidly and. importantly. this protein is not cleaved nor is it inhibited efficiently by the endogenous regulator XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis). The 1.63 Å (1 Å = 0.1 nm) structure of the variant demonstrates that the mutation is accommodated at the dimer interface to generate an enzyme with substantially the same activity and specificity as wild-type caspase-3. Structural modelling predicts that the interface mutation prevents the intersubunit linker from binding in the dimer interface. allowing the active sites to form in the procaspase in the absence of cleavage.

We report the crystal structures of Ral-GppNHp and Ral-GDP. Disordered switch I and switch II. located away from crystal contacts. are observed in one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit of the Ral-GppNHp structure. In the other molecule in the asymmetric unit. a second Mg2+ ion is bound to the GppNHp γ-phosphate in an environment in which switch I is pulled away from the nucleotide and switch II is found in a tight β turn. Clustering of conserved residues on the surface of Ral-GppNHp identifies two putative sites for protein-protein interaction. One site is adjacent to switch I.

Rio de Janeiro: DP&A",,103-116,,O artigo apresenta criticamente as imagens construídas por alunos e alunas sobre a realidade escolar e dá voz a esses alunos de Ensino Fundamental. A realidade que analisamos reflete o imaginário coletivo que orienta as práticas pedagógicas de sala de aula. As análises produzidas se pautam pela abordagem etnográfica crítica de sala de aula. Apresentamos as seguintes características da sala de aula: 1) a geografia da disciplina dos corpos; 2) a assimetria de poder; 3) a unilateralidade do discurso; 4) a imposição curricular; 5) a hierarquia do saber; e 6) o escrutínio− substituição da punição física pela exposição física. São realizadas análises de imagens como representação da realidade buscando o entendimento do movimento interno e dialético de construção que engendram essas imagens. Desenhos e narrativas ilustram e representam o fracasso escolar e a exclusão educacional. Dois eixos de análise são explorados: a realidade como dificuldades a serem superadas e como desigualdades sociais.

The technique is particularly suited to elucidate ambiguous catalytic steps in complex biochemical reactions. While NPC uniquely complements biochemical assays and X-ray structural analyses by revealing the protonation states of ionizable groups at and around the active site of enzymes. the technique suffers from a major drawback: large single crystals must be grown to compensate for the relatively low flux of neutron beams. However. in addition to revealing the positions of hydrogens involved in enzyme catalysis. NPC has the advantage over X-ray crystallography that the crystals do not suffer radiation damage.

In general. the function of a protein is associated with its interaction with other molecules. either small molecules or other large biological molecules. such as nucleic acids or proteins. Invariably. the function can be disrupted when that interaction is prevented. A complete industry exists solely for the purpose of finding such disruptors–they are called drugs. The discovery of drugs had been a serendipitous process. in an age when very little was known about the structures of the small molecules or their targets.

While Ras hydrolysis of GTP to GDP is intrinsically slow. we have discovered a GAP‐independent allosteric switch mechanism that results in ordering of switch II. placing the catalytic Q61 in the active site. This is expected to enhance the rate of hydrolysis through a mechanism where GTP acts as the general base. abstracting a proton from a nucleophilic water molecule. and shuttling it to a bridging water molecule that donates H‐bonds to Y32 in switch I and Q61 in switch II. This would promote a partial positive charge on the bridging water molecule. analogous to the arginine finger of GAP. In order to validate this mechanism we are solving the neutron crystal structure of H‐Ras to reveal the positions of hydrogen atoms in the active site.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Since the Industrial Revolution. the growth of economies throughout the world has been driven largely by the pursuit of scientific understanding. the application of engineering solutions. and continual technological innovation. Today. much of everyday life in the United States and other industrialized nations. as evidenced in transportation. communication. agriculture. education. health. defense. and jobs. is the product of investments in research and in the education of scientists and engineers (bold type for emphasis).As we ask whether we are effectively preparing the next generation of scientists. the best practices of pedagogy. metacognition. assessment. core concepts. and concept inventories have come to the forefront. In this spirit. the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) has launched an National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded 5 year project to support biochemistry and molecular biology educators learning what and how students learn. As a part of this initiative. hundreds of life scientists will plan and develop a rich central resource for biochemistry and molecular biology educators. This resource will include identification of biochemistry and molecular biology core concepts. skills. assessment tools. and effective pedagogical approaches. As a first step in this endeavor. experts in life science education research and concept assessment development recently converged for a Concept Assessment in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (CABMB) workshop on March 19–21. 2010 in Bethesda.

Ras mutations drive 20% of all human cancers and despite great efforts. there are currently no drugs targeting Ras. Raf interacts with Ras via its two N‐terminal Ras‐binding domains: the Ras‐binding domain (RBD) and the cysteine‐rich domain. Binding of both the Raf‐RBD and CRD are required for Ras‐mediated activation of Raf kinase. however. the mechanism that results in the activation of the C‐terminal Raf kinase domain remains unknown. Here we present the 2.8 Å crystal structure of Ras in complex with a Raf construct containing both the RBD and CRD. revealing the interface for Raf‐CRD binding.

Ltd,HRas is a small GTPase that acts as a molecular switch for the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway that leads to cell proliferation. survival. and differentiation. Oncogenic mutations in HRas renders it unable to hydrolyze GTP to GDP. resulting in constitutive activation of HRas and cell proliferation. Additionally. HRas contains an allosteric site that binds Ca 2+ and a negatively charged ligand. promoting helix 3 to shift towards helix 4 and the ordering of switch II. This conformation is associated with intrinsic hydrolysis of HRas in the presence of Raf. Experiments have been performed in our lab to study the effects of point mutations in the allosteric site of HRas on intrinsic hydrolysis constants. When compared to wild‐type.

Ltd,Ras is part of the major signaling cascade Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK which regulates cell proliferation. The dysregulation of this pathway through the mutation of Ras is highly implicated in up to 30% of human cancers. Pathway activation is dependent on the binding of Ras to Raf‐RBD and the subsequent dimerization of the Ras/Raf complex. This complex. however. is only robust in the presence of the membrane. In order to create a form of the Ras/Raf‐RBD dimer that is more stable in solution. we engineered mutations to promote covalent bonding at the dimer interface. Our data reveal the structure of a covalent HRas dimer in the absence of Raf‐RBD. and we present an analysis of the disulfide bonded dimer interface and its impact on allosteric connections to the active site.

These proteins act as molecular switches where they are activated by exchanging guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). and become inactivated when GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. Ras GTPases are mutated in 20% of human cancers. Within the Ras family. there are three isoforms: H‐Ras. K‐Ras. and N‐Ras. Due to the high structural similarities of the three isoforms. much of the structural efforts have focused on H‐ and K‐Ras while neglecting N‐Ras.

These dwarfs showed a 30‐fold reduction in levels of gibberellin A1 (GA1) and growth was partially restored by treatment with exogenous GA3.

Dordrecht,On a worldwide scale. the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) continues to increase in importance for consumption as a fresh crop. for inclusion as a major constituent in many prepared foods. and also for research into the fundamental principles of growth and development in plants. Members of the genus Lycopersicon are tolerant of a wide range of both environmental and nutritional conditions. A few of the species have been crossed to provide a large number of varieties directed towards either the production of a single-harvest field crop. or. particularly under protection. a succession of fruit for the fresh market over quite a long time-span. Field tomatoes are amenable to mechanical harvesting through the combined efforts of plant breeders and agricultural engineers. thus allowing vast tonnages to be grown and processed economically.

The methyltransferase. Ime4. is responsible for this modification and has a role in the initiation of meiosis. However. neither the function. nor the extent of distribution of this nucleotide modification is established. We demonstrate that in S. cerevisiae. substantial levels of internal adenosine methylation are present in the GpA context in mRNA from sporulating cells. which is consistent with the preferred methylation consensus of higher eukaryotes. Based upon our quantification data. every second transcript could contain one m6A during meiosis. As methylation is distributed across all mRNA size ranges. it is likely that m6A is not limited to a small population of messages.

Assessment of the purity of preparations involved phase-contrast and electron microscopy. assays for marker enzymes and RNA extraction and analysis. Proteins were extracted from isolated plastids at different ripening stages and separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The profiles obtained from chloroplasts and chromoplasts showed many qualitative and quantitative differences.

The steady state level of CAT mRNA in these plants was estimated to be less than 1% of the endogenous PG mRNA. Further constructs containing larger PG gene-flanking regions were generated and tested for their ability to direct higher levels of reporter gene expression. A 4.8 kb 5′-flanking region greatly increased levels of ripening-specific reporter gene activity. while a 1.8 kb 3′ region was only shown to have a positive regulatory role in the presence of the extended 5′ region.

We tested two independent strategies to overcome ethylene-mediated growth inhibition when plants are grown in drying soil. Antisense suppression of plant ethylene synthesis was trialled to overcome the inhibition of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) leaf expansion. Rhizosphere bacteria containing the enzyme ACC deaminase (to decrease plant levels of the ethylene precursor ACC (1-aminocyclo-propane carboxylic acid)) were trialled to overcome the inhibition of pea (Pisum sativum L.) root growth. Two pea genotypes (cv. Sparkle and its E2 (sym5) mutant) were grown at two levels of soil moisture in pots containing the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Variovorax paradoxus 5C-2. The bacterium stimulated root biomass by 20-25% irrespective of soil moisture regime. and whole plant biomass was stimulated also by 25% in plants grown in drying soil. Isogenic wild-type (WT) and ACO1AS genotypes of tomato were grown at two different soil moisture regimes. The ACO1AS genotype has decreased ACC oxidase activity and is thus less able to convert ACC to ethylene. Leaves of WT and ACO1AS plants elongated at the same rate under well-watered conditions. When plants were exposed to drying soil. both genotypes dried the soil to a similar extent but ACO1AS leaves had a 10% higher growth rate than WT leaves.

Studies of protein synthesis in vivo showed that application of 2 mol m−3 silver thiosulphate to mature green fruit prevented the appearance of several novel proteins associated with ripening. including the softening enzyme polygalacturonase. However. total protein synthesis. as judged by the incorporation of [35S] methionine into proteins. continued unabated after silver treatment. Ripening was also arrested when silver was supplied after ripening had begun. The accumulation of several ripening‐related mRNAs. including that for polygalacturonase. was studied by translation in vitro and using cDNA clones as hybridization probes.

The most widely documented example of ethylene-mediated cell expansion is promotion of the “triple response” of seedlings grown in the dark in ethylene. Roots and hypocotyls become shorter and thickened compared with controls due to a reorientation of cell expansion. and curvature of the apical hook is more pronounced. Theepinastic (epi) mutant of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) has a dark-grown seedling phenotype similar to the triple response even in the absence of ethylene.

Results indicated that vernolide had a higher reducing power than vernodalol and the ethanol extract. At 0.25 mg/mL. vernolide had an absorbance value of 0.15 while vernolide and the ethanol extract had absorbencies of 0.042 and 0.144. respectively. Catechin (a standard antioxidant compound). however. exhibited a higher reducing power than all the three samples.

ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) is a transcription factor that functions downstream from the ethylene receptors in the Arabidopsis ethylene signal transduction pathway. Three homologues of the Arabidopsis EIN3 gene have been identified in tomato. Lycopersicon esculentum. EIN3-like or LeEIL. LeEIL1. LeEIL2. and LeEIL3. These transcription factors have been proposed to be functionally redundant positive regulators of multiple ethylene responses. In order to test the role of such factors in the ethylene signal transduction pathway during ripening. EIL1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been over-expressed in the ethylene-insensitive non-ripening Nr mutant of tomato.

We have isolated a tomato ERF cDNA clone (LeERF3b) with sequence similarity to class II (repressor class) of the ERF family. which is regulated differently from Pti4 (a tomato ERF domain-containing gene that activates other genes). LeERF3b has similarities to other tomato ERF cDNAs but the DNA or predicted amino acid sequences have significant differences. Northern analysis showed that Pti4 was highly expressed during fruit ripening. whereas LeERF3b accumulated before and declined sharply after the onset of ripening. Furthermore.

It is a beneficial treatment. however. for the removal of astringency from persimmon to improve the fruit quality after harvest. High soluble tannins (SCTs) content is one of most important causes of astringency. High CO2 (95%) treatment effectively reduced SCTs in both “Mopan” and “Gongcheng-shuishi” persimmon fruit by causing increases in acetaldehyde. Using RNA-seq and realtime PCR. twelve ethylene response factor genes (DkERF11-22) were isolated and characterized. to determine those responsive to high CO2 treatment. Only two genes.

Moreover. DkERF19 and the previously isolated DkERF9 had additive effects on activating the DkPDC2 promoter.

115705,Control of translation initiation in animals,1998,Nicola K Gray and Marvin Wickens,14,,1,399-458,Annual Reviews,Regulation of translation initiation is a central control point in animal cells. We review our current understanding of the mechanisms of regulation. drawing particularly on examples in which the biological consequences of the regulation are clear. Specific mRNAs can be controlled via sequences in their 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and by alterations in the translation machinery. The 5′UTR sequence can determine which initiation pathway is used to bring the ribosome to the initiation codon. how efficiently initiation occurs. and which initiation site is selected. 5′UTR-mediated control can also be accomplished via sequence-specific mRNA-binding proteins. Sequences in the 3′ untranslated region and the poly(A) tail can have dramatic effects on initiation frequency. with particularly profound effects in oogenesis and early development.

We analyze the effects of single base changes in each position of AAUAAA and in the nucleotlde to which poly (A) is added on 3′ end formation in vitro.

The magnitude of reduction varies greatly with the position changed and the base introduced.

Here we focus on the mechanism of PUF-mediated regulation. The yeast PUF protein. Mpt5p. regulates HO mRNA and stimulates removal of its poly(A) tail (i.e. deadenylation). Mpt5p repression in vivo is dependent on POP2. a component of the cytoplasmic Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex that deadenylates mRNAs. In this study. we elucidate the individual roles of the Ccr4p and Pop2p deadenylases in Mpt5p-regulated deadenylation. Both in vivo and in vitro.

In the present work. we report that PUF proteins act directly on MAPK/ERK-encoding mRNAs to downregulate their expression in both the Caenorhabditis elegans germline and human embryonic stem cells. In C. elegans. FBF/PUF binds regulatory elements in the mpk-1 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) and coprecipitates with mpk-1 mRNA; moreover. mpk-1 expression increases dramatically in FBF mutants. In human embryonic stem cells. PUM2/PUF binds 3′UTR elements in both Erk2 and p38α mRNAs. and PUM2 represses reporter constructs carrying either Erk2 or p38α 3′ UTRs. Therefore. the PUF control of MAPK expression is conserved. Its biological function was explored in nematodes. where FBF promotes the self-renewal of germline stem cells. and MPK-1 promotes oocyte maturation and germ cell apoptosis. We found that FBF acts redundantly with LIP-1. the C. elegans homolog of MAPK phosphatase (MKP). to restrict MAPK activity and prevent apoptosis. In mammals. activated MAPK can promote apoptosis of cancer cells and restrict stem cell self-renewal. and MKP is upregulated in cancer cells.

Wispy acts as a poly(A) polymerase in a tethering assay and in vivo for cytoplasmic polyadenylation of specific mRNA targets during late oogenesis and early embryogenesis. wispy function is required at the final stage of oogenesis for metaphase of meiosis I arrest and for progression beyond this stage. By contrast. canonical PAP acts with Orb for the earliest steps of oogenesis.

This complex associates with RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs to repress translation of target mRNAs. We sought to determine how CCR4 and CAF1 participate in repression and control of maternal mRNAs using Xenopus laevis oocytes. We show that Xenopus CCR4 and CAF1 enzymes are active deadenylases and repress translation of an adenylated mRNA. CAF1 also represses translation independent of deadenylation. The deadenylation-independent repression requires a 5′ cap structure on the mRNA; however. deadenylation does not.

It regulates multiple mRNAs critical for stem cell maintenance and germline development.

These structures reveal that FBF binds to conserved bases at positions 1–3 and 7–8. The key specificity determinant of FBF vs. other PUF proteins lies in positions 4–6. In FBF/RNA complexes. these bases stack directly with one another and turn away from the RNA-binding surface.

We find that the addition of a full-length. 200-nucleotide poly(A) tail occurs in two discrete phases. In the first phase. the addition of each adenosine is dependent on the highly conserved sequence AAUAAA.

In the second phase. poly(A) addition no longer requires AAUAAA but. instead. requires the oligo(A) primer synthesized during the first phase. Thus.

The binding sites recognized by Puf5p are diverse. with variable spacer lengths between two specific sequences. Each length of site correlates with a distinct biological function. Crystal structures of Puf5p–RNA complexes reveal that the protein scaffold presents an exceptionally flat and extended interaction surface relative to other PUF proteins. In complexes with RNAs of different lengths. the protein is unchanged.

Regardless. experimental separation of RNA binding from function facilitates analysis of both properties. liberating each from the constraints of the other. “Tethered function” assays bring a protein to a reporter RNA through a designed RNA–protein interaction.

They interact with specific sequences in the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs and cause changes in RNA stability or translational activity. Here we describe an in vitro translation assay that reconstitutes the translational repression activity of canonical PUF proteins. In this system. recombinant PUF proteins were added to yeast cell lysates to repress reporter mRNAs bearing the 3′UTRs of specific target mRNAs. PUF proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans were active in the assay and were specific by multiple criteria. Puf5p. a yeast PUF protein. repressed translation of four target RNAs. Repression mediated by the HO 3′UTR was particularly efficient. due to a specific sequence in that 3′UTR.

To analyze the biology and molecular basis of this process. an adhesion-specific assay was developed: the phorbol ester-induced aggregation of human lymphocytes. This rapid and antigen-independent intercellular adhesion requires cellular metabolism. an intact cytoskeleton and extracellular divalent cations. and is mediated by preformed cell-surface proteins referred to as CAMs. Phorbol ester also induces aggregation of monocytes and granulocytes. as well as adhesion of T lymphocytes to either B cells or monocytes and of the leukocytes to vascular endothelial cells. By using the adhesion-specific assay and blocking monoclonal antibodies. several CAMs have been identified. namely the Leu-CAM family (CD11a-c/CD18) and ICAM-1 (CD54). The Leu-CAM family is composed of Leu-CAMa (CD11a/CD18). Leu-CAMb (CD11b/CD18) and Leu-CAMc (CD11c/CD18). three glycoprotein heterodimers made of a common beta-chain and distinct alpha-chains. ICAM-1 is an adhesive ligand for Leu-CAMa. Expression and use of the various CAMs is selective in different types of leukocytes. The Leu-CAMs have been purified and partially characterized. CD18. whose gene is on human chromosome 21. contains 5-6 N-linked complex-type oligosaccharides. and CD11 binds Ca++. Another adhesion pathway is mediated by CD2 and CD58. CD2. a glycoprotein selectively expressed by T cells. is a receptor for CD58. a cell-surface adhesive ligand with broad tissue distribution.

Inhibition of macrophage homing might therefore prevent atherosclerosis. Since HDL levels are inversely correlated with cardiovascular risk. their effect on macrophage homing was assessed in apoE‐deficient (apoE−/−) mice. Overexpression of human apolipoprotein AI in apoE−/− mice increased HDL levels 3‐fold and reduced macrophage accumulation in an established assay of leukocyte homing to aortic root endothelium 3.2‐fold (P< 0.005). This was due to reduced in vivo βVLDL oxidation. reduced βVLDL triggered endothelial cytosolic Ca2+ signaling through PAF‐like bioactivity. lower ICAM‐1 and VCAM‐1 expression. and diminished ex vivo leukocyte adhesion.

Stimulation of fat turnover in muscle cells during dietary fat challenge may contribute to maintenance of insulin sensitivity. Exercise in the fasted state markedly stimulates energy provision via fat oxidation. Therefore. we investigated whether exercise training in the fasted state is more potent than exercise in the fed state to rescue whole‐body glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity during a period of hyper‐caloric fat‐rich diet. Healthy male volunteers (18–25 y) received a hyper‐caloric (∼+30% kcal day−1) fat‐rich (50% of kcal) diet for 6 weeks.

As many of these processes are intimately linked with cell fate decisions. transient or chronic changes in cellular redox equilibrium are likely to contribute to the initiation and progression of a plethora of human diseases. Since a long time. it is known that mitochondria are major players in redox regulation and signaling. More recently. it has become clear that also peroxisomes have the capacity to impact redox-linked physiological processes. To serve this function. peroxisomes cooperate with other organelles. including mitochondria. This review provides a comprehensive picture of what is currently known about the redox interplay between mitochondria and peroxisomes in mammals. We first outline the pro- and antioxidant systems of both organelles and how they may function as redox signaling nodes. Next. we critically review and discuss emerging evidence that peroxisomes and mitochondria share an intricate redox-sensitive relationship and cooperate in cell fate decisions. Key issues include possible physiological roles. messengers. and mechanisms. We also provide examples of how data mining of publicly-available datasets from ‘omics’ technologies can be a powerful means to gain additional insights into potential redox signaling pathways between peroxisomes and mitochondria.

Although sphingosine is not recognized by the enzyme. it can be converted to a substrate by acylation with hexanoic anhydride. Using a mixed micellar assay. previously reported for the mass quantification of diacylglycerol. the short-chain ceramide (N-C6-sphingosine). generated by acylation. is quantitatively phosphorylated to N-C6-[32P]sphingosine phosphate.

To maintain a healthy cellular environment. dysfunctional and superfluous peroxisomes need to be selectively removed. Although emerging evidence suggests that peroxisomes are mainly degraded by pexophagy. little is known about the triggers and molecular mechanisms underlying this process in mammalian cells. In this study. we show that PEX5 proteins fused to a bulky C-terminal tag trigger peroxisome degradation in SV40 large T antigen-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In addition. we provide evidence that this process is autophagy-dependent and requires monoubiquitination of the N-terminal cysteine residue that marks PEX5 for recycling. As our findings also demonstrate that the addition of a bulky tag to the C terminus of PEX5 does not interfere with PEX5 monoubiquitination but strongly inhibits its export from the …,True,-pf-Sf8AAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC,77,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15548627.2015.1061846,6506903248977301569,/scholar?cites=6506903248977301569,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15548627.2015.1061846,0,0,0

However. with the exception of the peroxisome-targeting signal receptors and the receptor docking proteins. the function of most of these proteins. called peroxins. remains largely unknown. One step toward elucidating the function of a protein is to identify its interacting partners. We have used a non-transcription-based bacterial two-hybrid system to analyze the interactions among a set of 12 mammalian peroxins and a yeast protein three-hybrid system to investigate whether proteins that interact with the same peroxin and have overlapping binding sites cooperate or compete for this site. Here we report a detailed interaction map of these peroxins and demonstrate that (i) farnesylation. and not the CAAX motif. of Pex19p strongly enhances its affinity for Pex13p; (ii) the CAAXmotif. and not …,True,-pf-Sf8AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,77,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620343280,2992204640840374002,/scholar?cites=2992204640840374002,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620343280,0,0,0

Recently. studies have suggested that HDL cholesterol may inhibit and impaired cholesterol efflux may increase HSPC proliferation and differentiation.   Objectives We hypothesized that LDL may enhance HSPC proliferation and differentiation while HDL might have the opposing effect which might influence the size of the pool of inflammatory cells.   Methods and Results HSPC number and function were studied in hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout (LDLr−/−) mice on high fat diet. Hypercholesterolemia was associated with increased frequency of HSPC. monocytes and granulocytes in the peripheral blood (PB). In addition. an increased proportion of BM HSPC was in G2M of the cell cycle. and the percentage of HSPC and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) increased in BM of LDLr−/− mice. When BM Lin-Sca-1+cKit+ (i.e. “LSK”) cells were cultured in the presence of LDL in vitro we also found enhanced differentiation towards monocytes and granulocytes. Furthermore. LDL promoted lineage negative (Lin−) cells motility. The modulation by LDL on HSPC differentiation into granulocytes and motility was inhibited by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation. By contrast. when mice were infused with human apoA-I (the major apolipoprotein of HDL) or reconstituted HDL (rHDL). the frequency and proliferation of HSPC was reduced in BM in vivo.

Acid sphingomyelinase knockout mice (ASMko) are a suitable model to address the role of sphingolipids in synaptic regulation as they recapitulate a mental retardation syndrome. Niemann Pick disease type A (NPA). and their neurons have altered levels of sphingomyelin (SM) and its derivatives. Electrophysiological recordings showed that ASMko hippocampi have increased paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation. Consistently. electron microscopy revealed reduced number of docked vesicles. Biochemical analysis of ASMko synaptic membranes unveiled higher amounts of SM and sphingosine (Se) and enhanced interaction of the docking molecules Munc18 and syntaxin1. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrated that Se changes syntaxin1 conformation enhancing its interaction with Munc18. Moreover.

In patients with Zellweger disease. a lethal panperoxisomal disorder. and in mice lacking the Pxr1 import receptor for peroxisomal matrix proteins. the absence of peroxisomes leads to abnormal neuronal migration.

They also have a vital role in tolerance to several physiological stressors in a variety of organisms including cyanobacteria. The mechanism of desiccation tolerance relies on phospholipid bilayers which are stabilized during water stress by sugars. especially by trehalose. Unsaturation of fatty acids also counteracts water or salt stress. Hydrogen atoms adjacent to olefinic bonds are susceptible to oxidative attack. Lipids are rich in these bonds and are a primary target for oxidative reactions. Lipid oxidation is problematic as enzymes do not control many oxidative chemical reactions and some of the products of the attack are highly reactive species that modify proteins and DNA.

Surprisingly little is known about how membranes control the force from motors and how this may impact specific cellular functions. Here. we show that dynein motors physically cluster into microdomains on the membrane of a phagosome as it matures inside cells. Such geometrical reorganization allows many dyneins within a cluster to generate cooperative force on a single microtubule. This results in rapid directed transport of the phagosome toward microtubule minus ends. likely promoting phagolysosome fusion and pathogen degradation. We show that lipophosphoglycan. the major molecule implicated in immune evasion of Leishmania donovani. inhibits phagosome motion by disrupting the clustering and therefore the cooperative force generation of dynein.

Plant architecture is controlled by a group of regulatory genes. It was previously found that ectopic expression of some MADS-box genes resulted in early flowering and a dwarf habit in Arabidopsis and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. To explore ways to alter heading time and heading height. we expressed ectopically several OsMADS (Oryza sativa MADS-box) genes in rice plants. The OsMADS cDNA clones were connected to the maize ubiquitin promoter in the sense orientation. and the constructs were introduced into rice plants by the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

116029,Analysis of electro discharge machined surfaces of EN-31 tool steel,2008,HS Payal and Rajesh Choudhary and Sarabjeet Singh,,,,,CSIR,In this study. experiments were performed to determine parameters effecting surface roughness (SR) along with structural analysis of surfaces with respect to material removal parameters. Experimental work was conducted on EN-31 tool steel with copper. brass and graphite as tool electrodes with kerosene oil as dielectric fluid. The data compiled during experimentation has been used to yield responses in respect of material removal rate (MRR) and SR. Detailed analysis of structural features of machined surface was done by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and optical microscope to understand the mode of heat affected zone (HAZ). which alternatively affects structure of machined workpiece and hence tool life. While investigating electric discharge machining (EDM) surface by micrographs. it was observed that molten mass has been removed from surface as ligaments and sheets. In some cases. it is removed as chunks. which being in molten state stuck to surface.

METHODS: The study was undertaken in 40 adult patients of chronic renal failure. The patients were randomly divided into two groups A and B of 20 patients each. Group A patients were given oral iron and group B patients were given intravenous iron. All patients in both groups were given recombinant human erythropoietin 2000 IU twice weekly subcutaneously. The study was carried for up to three months. Patients were monitored every month for renal parameters and haematological parameters which included haemoglobin. reticulocyte count and packed cell volume. Ferrokinetic studies were done at baseline and at three months. RESULTS: It was observed that haematological parameters showed significant statistical improvement in the intravenous iron group as compared to group A (oral iron group). The ferrokinetic studies revealed that serum iron. serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. decreased significantly in oral iron group. whereas significant increase was seen in group B (intravenous iron group). None of the patients developed any adverse effects because of erythropoietin or iron therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant use of intravenous iron is better than oral iron in CRF patients treated with rHuEPO. The intravenous route of iron administration may be a preferred route along with rHuEPO therapy. more so in the Indian context where prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia is fairly high.,True,mjCLamoAAAAJ:pQthLKZIaNQC,66,https://europepmc.org/article/med/12725261,16954895447224444646,/scholar?cites=16954895447224444646,,,0,0,0

India,2004,VK Gahalaut and SK Singh,31,Geophysical research letters,11,,,Earthquakes in the Koyna‐Warna region of peninsular India are considered to be reservoir triggered. However. analyses of the available earthquake data indicate that the sustained high seismicity in this region may be influenced also by the geometry of the fault zones and their interactions through stress transfer. These distinct fault zones. inferred from the earthquake distribution and their focal mechanisms. are favourably oriented to each other in such a way that earthquake occurrences in one of the fault zones increase static stress on the other. facilitating frequent and continuing occurrence of earthquakes in the region. Here we show that though the effect of reservoir operations do promote slip on these faults. stress triggering appears to be an important cause for continuing high seismicity as it brings some of the stabilized faults closer to failure in the manner consistent with the inferred sense of motion.,True,mjCLamoAAAAJ:ddB7do2jUx8C,53,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2004GL019818,5103162107382359332,/scholar?cites=5103162107382359332,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2004GL019818,0,0,0

Western poplar is a model woody tree and a potential bioenergy feedstock. To investigate the extent of stress-regulated alternative splicing. we conducted an in-depth survey of leaf. root. and stem xylem transcriptomes under drought. salt. or temperature stress. Analysis of approximately one billion of genome-aligned RNA-Seq reads from tissue- or stress-specific libraries revealed over fifteen millions of novel splice junctions. Transcript models supported by both RNA-Seq and single molecule isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) data revealed a broad array of novel stress- and/or tissue-specific isoforms. Analysis of Iso-Seq data also resulted in the discovery of 15.087 novel transcribed regions of which 164 show alternate splicing. Our findings demonstrate that abiotic stresses profoundly perturb transcript isoform profiles and trigger widespread intron retention events. Stress treatments often increased or decreased retention of specific introns – a phenomenon described here as differential intron retention (DIR). Many differentially retained introns were regulated in a stress- and/or tissue-specific manner. A subset of transcripts harboring super stress-responsive DIR events showed persisting fluctuations in the degree of intron retention across all treatments and tissue types. To investigate coordinated dynamics of intron-containing transcripts in the study we quantified absolute copy number of isoforms of two conserved transcription factors using Droplet Digital PCR.

The mechanism appears to be one in which planar. disk-like asphaltene molecules aggregate through lateral intermolecular forces to form primary aggregates or micelles which are interfacially active. These aggregates — upon adsorbing at the oil-water interface — crosslink through physical interactions to form a viscoelastic network. which has been characterized by some as a “skin” or a “plastic film”. The strength of this film. as gauged by shear and elastic moduli. seems to correlate well with water-in-oil emulsion stability. What is still relatively unknown is the role of chemistry in governing the strength of these lateral inter-asphaltene interactions.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Of all isolated neurotrophic molecules Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is the only one with a fully established physiological function. at least in the peripheral nervous system (see Thoenen and Edgar 1985; Thoenen et al. 1987b). This is largely due to the fact that it is present in very large quantities in exocrine glands (eg submandibular gland of the male mouse and accessory genital organs of various species). The physiological function of NGF in these exocrine glands is unknown. In any case it is irrelevant for the development and maintenance of specific properties of NGF responsive neurons (see Greene and Shooter 1980; Thoenen and Barde 1980; Thoenen et al. t985). These rich sources allowed the purification of NGF at an early stage of NGF research. This purification was an essential prerequisite for the production of anti-NGF antibodies (see Levi-Montalcini 1966; Levi-Montalcini and Angeletti 1968). the …,True,XA5D9uMAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,652,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0031026,8357164898300634580,/scholar?cites=8357164898300634580,,,0,0,0

Ltd,The protein brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been postulated to be a retrograde or paracrine synaptic messenger in long‐term potentiation and other forms of activity‐dependent synaptic plasticity. Although crucial for this concept. direct evidence for the activity‐dependent synaptic release of BDNF is lacking. Here we investigate secretion of BDNF labelled with green fluorescent protein (BDNF–GFP) by monitoring the changes in fluorescence intensity of dendritic BDNF–GFP vesicles at glutamatergic synaptic junctions of living hippocampal neurons. We show that high‐frequency activation of glutamatergic synapses triggers the release of BDNF–GFP from synaptically localized secretory granules. This release depends on activation of postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors and on postsynaptic Ca 2+ influx.

Comparison of NGF levels with its mRNA revealed that both were correlated with the density of sympathetic innervation.

Transmembrane ephrinB ligands act as “receptor-like” signaling molecules. in part mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation and by engagement with PDZ domain proteins. However. the underlying cell biology and signaling mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that Src family kinases (SFKs) are positive regulators of ephrinB phosphorylation and phosphotyrosine-mediated reverse signaling. EphB receptor engagement of ephrinB causes rapid recruitment of SFKs to ephrinB expression domains and transient SFK activation. With delayed kinetics. ephrinB ligands recruit the cytoplasmic PDZ domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BL and are dephosphorylated.

(1983) Dev. Brain Res.9. 45–52) and that hippocampal NGF and mRNANGF levels are correlated with the density of cholinergic innervation (Korsching et al. (1985) EMBO J.4. 1389–1393). In the present investigation we have compared the developmental changes of ChAT. NGF. and mRNANGF levels in this system. During the postnatal development of the hippocampus the time courses of NGF and ChAT were well correlated including the most rapid increase between P12 and P14. This increase in hippocampal NGF was preceded by a corresponding increase in mRNANGF.

Here we have used a mouse model expressing activated Ras under the direction of the neuronal Synapsin I promoter (named synRas mice). These mice develop down-regulated proliferation of adult hippocampal precursor cells and show decreased short-term recognition memory performances. Voluntary physical activity reversed the genetically blocked generation of hippocampal proliferating cells and enhanced the dendritic arborisation of the resulting doublecortin newly generated neurons. Moreover. running improved novelty recognition in both wild type and synRas littermates. compensating their memory deficits. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed to be a potential mediator of physical exercise acting in the hippocampus on dentate neurons and their precursors. This was confirmed here by the identification of doublecortin-immunoreactive cells expressing TrkB BDNF receptor. While no difference in BDNF levels were detected in basal conditions between the synRas mice and their wild type littermates. running was associated with enhanced BDNF expression levels. Thus increased BDNF signalling is a candidate mechanism to explain the observed effects of running.

Proinflammatory cytokines. such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) released from astrocytes and microglia activated by infection or ischemia have previously been shown to impair survival and maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitors and could thus be considered as potential factors contributing to the generation of this disease. The first goal of the present study was to investigate whether exposure of oligodendrocyte precursors to these cytokines arrests the maturation of ion currents in parallel to its effects on myelin proteins and morphological maturation. Secondly. in the search for agents. that can protect differentiating oligodendrocyte precursor cells from cytokine-induced damage we investigated effects of coapplications of corticosteroids with proinflammatory cytokines on the subsequent survival and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. To exclude influences from factors released from other cell types purified cultures of oligodendrocyte precursors were exposed to cytokines and/or steroids and allowed to differentiate for further 6 days in culture.

Autophagy has been shown to be protective at the early stages of programmed cell death but it can also promote apoptosis under certain conditions. Earlier we demonstrated that oxygen contributes to the pathogenesis of neonatal brain damage. which can be ameliorated by intervention with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo). Extrinsic-and intrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved in oxygen induced neurotoxicity but the role of autophagy in this model is unclear. We analyzed the expression of autophagy activity markers in the immature rodent brain after exposure to elevated oxygen concentrations. We observed a hyperoxia-exposure dependent regulation of autophagy-related gene (Atg) proteins Atg3. 5. 12. Beclin-1. microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). LC3A-II. and LC3B-II which are all key autophagy activity proteins. Interestingly. a single injection with rhEpo at the onset of hyperoxia counteracted these oxygen-mediated effects.

PDZ2b shows no apparent interaction with APC. Here the solution structure of the splicing variant of PDZ2 with the insertion has been determined using 2D and 3D heteronuclear NMR experiments. The structural reason for the changed binding specificity is the reorientation of the loop with extra five amino acid residues. which folds back onto β-strands two and three.

In order to facilitate such electrophysiological studies. the degree of ploidy of C6 cells was increased in three successive steps. At each step complementary drug-resistant mutants of C6 were fused and hybrid cell clones isolated in selective culture medium. Cell volume was measured by electronic cell sizing and DNA content per cell assessed by impulse cytofluorimetry. In the final polyploid line. C6-4-2. both parameters were found to be increased 6-fold in comparison with the original cell line C6.

The novel multi-PDZ domain protein FRMPD2 is a potential scaffolding protein consisting of an N-terminal KIND domain. a FERM domain and three PDZ domains. Here we show that FRMPD2 is localized in a polarized fashion in epithelial cells at the basolateral membrane and partially colocalizes with the tight-junction marker protein Zonula-occludens-1. Downregulation of FRMPD2 protein in Caco-2 cells is associated with an impairment of tight junction formation. We find that the FERM domain of FRMPD2 binds phosphatidylinositols and is sufficient for membrane localization.

The intracellular membrane‐anchored GTPase Ras can be activated by a number of upstream mechanisms including binding of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor to its specific TrkB receptor. Ras activity plays an important morphogenetic role in neurons and therefore might also be involved in the asymmetric differentiation of tectal cells. To investigate the role of Ras. we determined the relative levels of activated Ras and of signalling active phospho‐TrkB in tecta of light‐ and dark‐incubated pigeons and combined this with an immunohistochemical detection of Ras‐GTP and TrkB receptors.

116192,Ras and rheb signaling in survival and cell death,2013,Anja Ehrkamp and Christian Herrmann and Raphael Stoll and Rolf Heumann,5,,2,639-661,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,One of the most obvious hallmarks of cancer is uncontrolled proliferation of cells partly due to independence of growth factor supply. A major component of mitogenic signaling is Ras. a small GTPase. It was the first identified human protooncogene and is known since more than three decades to promote cellular proliferation and growth. Ras was shown to support growth factor-independent survival during development and to protect from chemical or mechanical lesion-induced neuronal degeneration in postmitotic neurons. In contrast. for specific patho-physiological cases and cellular systems it has been shown that Ras may also promote cell death. Proteins from the Ras association family (Rassf. especially Rassf1 and Rassf5) are tumor suppressors that are activated by Ras-GTP. triggering apoptosis via eg. activation of mammalian sterile 20-like (MST1) kinase. In contrast to Ras. their expression is suppressed in many types of tumours. which makes Rassf proteins an exciting model for understanding the divergent effects of Ras activity. It seems likely that the outcome of Ras signaling depends on the balance between the activation of its various downstream effectors. thus determining cellular fate towards either proliferation or apoptosis. Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) is a protein from the Ras superfamily that is also known to promote proliferation. growth. and regeneration through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) pathway. However. recent evidences indicate that the Rheb-mTor pathway may switch its function from a pro-growth into a cell death pathway. depending on the cellular situation.

This technique was specific for members of the E. phagocytophila group. which include E. phagocytophila. Ehrlichia equi. and the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. The TaqMan system identified 10 copies of a cloned section of the 16S rRNA gene ofE. phagocytophila. The sensitivity and specificity of the TaqMan PCR were similar to those of conventional nested PCR.

In order to save this species. the Spanish authorities implemented a captive breeding program recruiting lynxes from the wild. In this context. a retrospective survey on prevalence of selected feline pathogens in free-ranging lynxes was initiated.  Methodology/ Principal Findings We systematically analyzed the prevalence and importance of seven viral. one protozoan (Cytauxzoon felis). and several bacterial (e.g.. hemotropic mycoplasma) infections in 77 of approximately 200 remaining free-ranging Iberian lynxes of the Doñana and Sierra Morena areas. in Southern Spain. between 2003 and 2007. With the exception of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). evidence of infection by all tested feline pathogens was found in Iberian lynxes. Fourteen lynxes were feline leukemia virus (FeLV) provirus-positive; eleven of these were antigenemic (FeLV p27 positive). All 14 animals tested negative for other viral infections. During a six-month period in 2007. six of the provirus-positive antigenemic lynxes died. Infection with FeLV but not with other infectious agents was associated with mortality (p<0.001). Sequencing of the FeLV surface glycoprotein gene revealed a common origin for ten of the eleven samples. The ten sequences were closely related to FeLV-A/61E. originally isolated from cats in the USA. Endogenous FeLV sequences were not detected.  Conclusions/Significance It was concluded that the FeLV infection most likely originated from domestic cats invading the lynx's habitats.

We have developed an one-tube quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay based on the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (TaqMan) to quantify the viral load of FIV-infected cats. Two different primer/probe systems were designed to detect a broad range of clade A FIV isolates. Both systems are characterized by excellent reproducibility. high sensitivity. and a wide range of quantification. As a consequence of this improved precision in the quantitative RT-PCR. preassay variations have greater impact on the accuracy of the viral load estimation. To compensate for these variations. we improved the assay and developed a multiplex real-time RT-PCR. which allows simultaneous calculation of the viral copy number and the individual recovery rate in an one-tube reaction. This enables the rapid and accurate calculation of copy number independent of preassay variations. In further studies. two additional real-time RT-PCR assays were designed and used to investigate the influence of sequence variations in the binding regions for either the primers or probe. Sequence mismatches in this region had a significant effect (up to 4 logarithmic decades) on reaction efficiency. In view of the inherent variability of retroviral sequences. these results underline the necessity to check reaction efficiencies before determining viral load.,True,7JMeUnQAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,88,https://europepmc.org/article/med/11176264,10468268201881103953,/scholar?cites=10468268201881103953,,,0,0,0

Furthermore. isolation of MM tumor cell lines has proven to be quite problematic due to their slow growth rate.

However. the resistance to accessibility of sugars embedded in plant cell walls (so-called recalcitrance) is a major barrier to economically viable cellulosic ethanol production. A recent report from the US National Academy of Sciences indicated that. “absent technological breakthroughs”. it was unlikely that the US would meet the congressionally mandated renewable fuel standard of 35 billion gallons of ethanol-equivalent biofuels plus 1 billion gallons of biodiesel by 2022. We here describe the properties of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) biomass that has been genetically engineered to increase the cellulosic ethanol yield by more than 2-fold. We have increased the cellulosic ethanol yield from switchgrass by 2.6-fold through overexpression of the transcription factor PvMYB4. This strategy reduces carbon deposition into lignin and phenolic fermentation inhibitors while maintaining the availability of potentially fermentable soluble sugars and pectic polysaccharides. Detailed biomass characterization analyses revealed that the levels and nature of phenolic acids embedded in the cell-wall. the lignin content and polymer size. lignin internal linkage levels. linkages between lignin and xylans/pectins. and levels of wall-bound fucose are all altered in PvMYB4-OX lines.

Although it imports and ferments both pentose and hexose sugars to produce a mixture of ethanol. acetate. lactate. H2 and CO2. the proportion of ethanol is low. which impedes its use in consolidated bioprocessing for biofuels production. Therefore genetic engineering will likely be required to improve the ethanol yield. Plasmid transformation. random mutagenesis and heterologous expression systems have previously been developed for C. cellulolyticum. but targeted mutagenesis has not been reported for this organism. hindering genetic engineering. The first targeted gene inactivation system was developed for C. cellulolyticum. based on a mobile group II intron originating from the Lactococcus lactis L1.LtrB intron. This markerless mutagenesis system was used to disrupt both the paralogous L-lactate dehydrogenase (Ccel_2485; ldh) and L-malate dehydrogenase (Ccel_0137; mdh) genes. distinguishing the overlapping substrate specificities of these enzymes. Both mutations were then combined in a single strain. resulting in a substantial shift in fermentation toward ethanol production. This double mutant produced 8.5-times more ethanol than wild-type cells growing on crystalline cellulose. Ethanol constituted 93% of the major fermentation products. corresponding to a molar ratio of ethanol to organic acids of 15. versus 0.18 in wild-type cells. During growth on acid-pretreated switchgrass. the double mutant also produced four times as much ethanol as wild-type cells.

Samples were taken pre-shock and 2. 12. 30. 60. 120. and 240 min post-shock. and from untreated control fermentations for systems biology analyses. Cell growth was arrested by ethanol supplementation with intracellular accumulation of carbon sources such as cellobiose. and sugar phosphates. including fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. The largest response of C. thermocellum to ethanol shock treatment was in genes and proteins related to nitrogen uptake and metabolism. which is likely important for redirecting the cells physiology to overcome inhibition and allow growth to resume.

Previous studies indicated that several stress-related proteins and changes in the ZM4 membrane lipid composition may contribute to ethanol tolerance. However. the molecular mechanisms of its ethanol stress response have not been elucidated fully.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. ethanol stress responses were investigated using systems biology approaches. Medium supplementation with an initial 47 g/L (6% v/v) ethanol reduced Z. mobilis ZM4 glucose consumption. growth rate and ethanol productivity compared to that of untreated controls. A proteomic analysis of early exponential growth identified about one thousand proteins. or approximately 55% of the predicted ZM4 proteome. Proteins related to metabolism and stress response such as chaperones and key regulators were more abundant in the early ethanol stress condition. Transcriptomic studies indicated that the response of ZM4 to ethanol is dynamic. complex and involves many genes from all the different functional categories. Most down-regulated genes were related to translation and ribosome biogenesis. while the ethanol-upregulated genes were mostly related to cellular processes and metabolism. Transcriptomic data were used to update Z. mobilis ZM4 operon models. Furthermore. correlations among the transcriptomic. proteomic and metabolic data were examined. Among significantly expressed genes or proteins. we observe higher correlation coefficients when fold-change values are higher.

This process is thought to involve readjusting resource allocation to different pathways. It has been frequently observed that among secondary cell wall components. alteration in lignin biosynthesis results in changes in both growth and defense. How this process is regulated. leading to growth or defense. remains largely elusive. In this article. we review the canonical lignin biosynthesis pathway. the recently-discovered tyrosine shortcut pathway. and the biosynthesis of unconventional C-lignin. We summarize the current model of the hierarchical transcriptional regulation of lignin biosynthesis.

116472,Consistent 1. 3-propanediol production from glycerol in mixed culture fermentation over a wide range of pH,2016,Roman Moscoviz and Eric Trably and Nicolas Bernet,9,Biotechnology for biofuels,1,1-11,BioMed Central,Glycerol is currently an over-produced chemical that can be used as substrate for the production of high value products such as 1.3-propanediol (1.3-PDO) in fermentation processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of initial pH on a batch mixed culture fermentation of glycerol. considering both the bacterial community composition and the fermentation patterns. For pH values between 5 and 9. 1.3-PDO production yields ranged from 0.52 ± 0.01 to 0.64 ± 0.00                                                                                                                                                                           . with the highest values obtained at pH 7 and 8. An Enterobacteriaceae member closely related to Citrobacter freundii was strongly enriched at all pH values. Within the less dominant bacterial species. two different microbial community structures were found. one at acid pH values and another at neutral to basic pH values. 1.3-PDO production was improved at pH values over 7. It was anti-correlated with lactate and ethanol production but positively correlated with acetate production. No direct correlation between 1.3-PDO production and a specific family of bacteria was found. suggesting functional redundancies in the microbial community.

Cellulolytic microbes are often robust biomass hydrolyzers and may offer cost advantages; however. it is unknown whether their activity can also be significantly influenced by the ratio of different monolignol types in Populus biomass. Hydrolysis and fermentation of autoclaved. but otherwise not pretreated Populus trichocarpa by Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 was compared using feedstocks that had similar carbohydrate and total lignin contents but differed in S/G ratios.

For either microbes or commercial enzymes. an approximate 50 % relative difference in total solids solubilization was measured for both biomasses. which suggests that the differences and limitations in the microbial breakdown of lignocellulose may be largely from the enzymatic hydrolytic process. Surprisingly. the reduction in glucan content per gram solid in the residual microbially processed biomass was similar (17–18 %) irrespective of S/G ratio. pointing to a similar mechanism of solubilization that proceeded at different rates. Fermentation metabolome testing did not reveal the release of known biomass-derived alcohol and aldehyde inhibitors that could explain observed differences in microbial hydrolytic activity.

To understand the contribution of individual microbiome members in a community. we studied the function of a simplified community consisting of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia bacterial strains isolated from Populus hosts and inoculated on axenic Populus cutting in controlled laboratory conditions. Both strains increased lateral root formation and root hair production in Arabidopsis plate assays and are predicted to encode for different functions related to growth and plant growth promotion in Populus hosts. Inoculation individually. with either bacterial isolate. increased root growth relative to uninoculated controls. and while root area was increased in mixed inoculation. the interaction term was insignificant indicating additive effects of root phenotype. Complementary data including photosynthetic efficiency. whole-transcriptome gene expression and GC-MS metabolite expression data in individual and mixed inoculated treatments indicate that the effects of these bacterial strains are unique and additive.

116499,Rhizosphere microbiomes diverge among Populus trichocarpa plant-host genotypes and chemotypes. but it depends on soil origin,2019,Allison M Veach and Reese Morris and Daniel Z Yip and Zamin K Yang and Nancy L Engle and Melissa A Cregger and Timothy J Tschaplinski and Christopher W Schadt,7,Microbiome,1,1-15,BioMed Central,Plants have developed defense strategies for phytopathogen and herbivore protection via coordinated metabolic mechanisms. Low-molecular weight metabolites produced within plant tissues. such as salicylic acid. represent one such mechanism which likely mediates plant – microbe interactions above and below ground. Salicylic acid is a ubiquitous phytohormone at low levels in most plants. yet are concentrated defense compounds in Populus. likely acting as a selective filter for rhizosphere microbiomes. We propagated twelve Populus trichocarpa genotypes which varied an order of magnitude in salicylic acid (SA)-related secondary metabolites. in contrasting soils from two different origins. After four months of growth. plant properties (leaf growth. chlorophyll content. and net photosynthetic rate) and plant root metabolomics specifically targeting SA metabolites were measured via GC-MS. In addition. rhizosphere microbiome composition was measured via Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S and ITS2 rRNA-genes. Soil origin was the primary filter causing divergence in bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities with plant genotype secondarily influential. Both bacterial/archaeal and fungal evenness varied between soil origins and bacterial/archaeal diversity and evenness correlated with at least one SA metabolite (diversity: populin; evenness: total phenolics). The production of individual salicylic acid derivatives that varied by host genotype resulted in compositional differences for bacteria /archaea (tremuloidin) and fungi (salicylic acid) within one soil origin (Clatskanie) whereas soils from Corvallis did not illicit microbial compositional …,True,qLSYcUEAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC,36,https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0668-8?utm_campaign=BSLB_AWA_SK01_GL_40168_HP_TrendMDQ420&utm_content=null&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=trendmd,7677676270177737669,/scholar?cites=7677676270177737669,,https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0668-8?utm_campaign=BSLB_AWA_SK01_GL_40168_HP_TrendMDQ420&utm_content=null&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=trendmd,0,0,0

The anaerobic. thermophilic. cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum is a candidate microorganism for such conversions but it. like many bacteria. is sensitive to potential toxic inhibitors developed in the liquid hydrolysate produced during biomass processing. Microbial processes leading to tolerance of these inhibitory compounds found in the pretreated biomass hydrolysate are likely complex and involve multiple genes.   Methodology/Principal FindingsIn this study. we developed a 17.5% v/v Populus hydrolysate tolerant mutant strain of C. thermocellum by directed evolution. The genome of the wild type strain. six intermediate population samples and seven single colony isolates were sequenced to elucidate the mechanism of tolerance. Analysis of the 224 putative mutations revealed 73 high confidence mutations. A longitudinal analysis of the intermediate population samples. a pan-genomic analysis of the isolates. and a hotspot analysis revealed 24 core genes common to all seven isolates and 8 hotspots. Genetic mutations were matched with the observed phenotype through comparison of RNA expression levels during fermentation by the wild type strain and mutant isolate 6 in various concentrations of Populus hydrolysate (0%. 10%. and 17.5% v/v).

Although much of the work-to-date has centered on characterizing this microbe’s growth on model cellulosic substrates. such as cellobiose. Avicel. or filter paper. it is vitally important to understand its metabolism on more complex. lignocellulosic substrates to identify relevant industrial bottlenecks that could undermine efficient biofuel production. To this end. we have examined a time course progression of C. thermocellum grown on switchgrass to assess the metabolic and protein changes that occur during the conversion of plant biomass to ethanol. The most striking feature of the metabolome was the observed accumulation of long-chain. branched fatty acids over time. implying an adaptive restructuring of C. thermocellum’s cellular membrane as the culture progresses. This is undoubtedly a response to the gradual accumulation of lignocellulose-derived inhibitory compounds as the organism deconstructs the switchgrass to access the embedded cellulose. Corroborating the metabolomics data. proteomic analysis revealed a corresponding time-dependent increase in various enzymes. including those involved in the interconversion of branched amino acids valine. leucine. and isoleucine to iso- and anteiso-fatty acid precursors.

Sperm bind to the VL by the tip of a large unreacted acrosome granule. After binding. the tip of the granule opens and the soluble contents are released onto the VL. A hole about 3 μm in diameter then forms in the VL in the area of the discharging acrosome. Ultrastructural observations show the hole to be filled with attenuated VL fibers. The sperm then swims through the hole and interacts with the egg plasma membrane. The soluble contents of abalone acrosomes can be obtained by induction of the acrosome reaction in high-calcium seawater.

The 652-aa suNCKX shares structural topology with other NCKX proteins. and has two protein kinase A sites and a His-rich region in its cytoplasmic loop. The suNCKX is encoded by a single gene. which is highly expressed in testes. The suNCKX activity of whole sperm shows Na+ and K+ dependence. and like other NCKXs can run in reverse exchange mode.

Palaeomagnetism of Nime Seamounts in the Western Pacific and of Three Volcamoes in Japan.,1967,Victor VACQUIER and Seiya UYEDA,,,,,,Assuming uniformity of magnetization. the direction and intensity of magnetization of nine seamounts in the Western Pacific off the coast of Japan have been computed from their topographic and magnetic surveys. The average position of the palaeomagnetic poles from the three seamounts in the Pacific Basin is at 56 N-66 W. which agrees in latitude with the average pole position of 51 N-14 W obtained previously from another group of four seamounts in the Pacific Basin off Hokkaido. A group of three seamounts west of the Izu-Bonin Arc (Shikoku Basin) gave an average pole position of 76 N-44 W. The difference in latitude between the pole positions of the groups within and outside the Pacific Basin can be interpreted as caused by a northerly drift of the Pacific Ocean floor.

Within minutes after coelomic fluid is removed from the body cavity. a massive cell–cell adhesion of coelomocytes occurs. This event is referred to as clotting. Clotting is thought to be a defense mechanism against loss of coelomic fluid if the body wall is punctured. and it may also function in the cellular encapsulation of foreign material and microbes. Here we show that this intercoelomocyte adhesion is mediated by amassin. a coelomic plasma protein with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 75 kD. Amassin forms large disulfide-bonded aggregates that adhere coelomocytes to each other. One half of the amassin protein comprises an olfactomedin (OLF) domain.

Oyster bindin is a single-copy gene encoding a diversity of protein variants. Oyster bindins have a conserved N-terminal region followed by one to five tandem fucose-binding lectin (F-lectin) domains.

Sperm–egg adhesion during sea urchin fertilization is an ideal model system for studying the molecular basis of a specific intercellular adhesion. The biological significance of sperm–egg interaction is well established; the gametes are homogeneous populations of single cells that can be obtained in large quantity and the interaction of sperm and egg occurs with great synchrony in a time span of seconds. The apex of the sea urchin spermatozoan contains a Golgi-derived acrosome granule approximately 0.3 μm in diameter composed of a uniformly electron-dense granular material.

To create the hole. lysin binds tightly to VERL (the VE receptor for lysin). a giant. unbranched glycoprotein comprising 30% of the VE.

According to this scheme. the surface of the globe is divided into roughly ten major rigid plates presently moving with respect to each other in response to unknown forces deep in the earth. Plates may consist of both continental and oceanic parts. their present boundaries being outlined by earthquakes.Where two plates move away from each other new crust is formed at the rate of 1 to 12 cm/year. while when they move toward each other crust is being consumed often by underthrusting of a cold plate thus causing deep and shallow earthquakes. The most conspicuous spreading occurs in the ocean floor at the crest of oceanic ridges like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where only shallow earthquakes occur because hot rock is close to the surface. As it cools. the new crust becomes magnetized in the direction of the magnetic field. When the field reverses its direction the rock is magnetized in the opposite way. Thus strips of positively and negatively magnetized rock form symmetrical bands on either side of the spreading ridges. which cause identical sequences of magnetic anomalies in widely different parts of the world. These properties of symmetry about the ridge axis and world-wide identity of the sequence of magnetic anomalies parallel to oceanic ridges establish beyond the shadow of a doubt that during the last 80 million years (my) at least. the geomagnetic field can be regarded as due to a …,True,kwJk-2UAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC,73,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=D0d9m9rlyr4C&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:y4LOjHUpkJkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=u3CgK4BQ93&sig=GYxHpugnV7KfCuS7wfJX_HnqPoE,11065389869299565259,/scholar?cites=11065389869299565259,,,0,0,0

Within seconds of sperm–egg interaction. calcium is released from the egg endoplasmic reticulum. launching the zygote into the mitotic cell cycle and the developmental program. The sequence of the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome offers unique opportunities to apply functional genomic and proteomic approaches to investigate the repertoire and regulation of Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis modules present in the egg and zygote. The sea urchin “calcium toolkit” as predicted by the genome is described.

Carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) comprise a large family of ancient protein modules of approximately 120 amino acids. having the same protein fold. that bind terminal sugar residues on glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Sea urchin sperm express three suREJ (sea urchin receptor for egg jelly) proteins on their plasma membranes. suREJ1 has two CRDs. whereas suREJ2 and suREJ3 both have one CRD. suREJ1 binds the fucose sulfate polymer (FSP) of egg jelly to induce the sperm acrosome reaction.

In 12 randomly picked clones of the Red abalone (H. rufescens) SalI satellite. 16 positions varied. the variation being spread throughout the sequence. GenBank database searches found no significant similarities between this satellite and known sequences.

The present study was undertaken to establish the molecular identity of this immunoreactive component. Purification from human serum was accomplished by immunoaffinity chromatography using. as the ligand. monoclonal antitransferrin receptor antibody. The receptor preparation contained two major components with M. of 75.000 and 85.000. which were identifed as transferrin and transferrin receptor. respectively. The physicochemical and immunochemical properties of the 85.000 serum receptor were compared with those established for intact placental transferrin receptor. The serum receptor exhibited an apparent M.= 85.000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions. as compared with 190.000 for placental transferrin receptor.

These changes are extremely complex and occur very slowly. We demonstrate here that hemoglobin and myoglobin are extremely susceptible to damage by glucose in vitro through a process that leads to complete destruction of the essential heme group. This process appears in addition to the expected formation of so-called advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on lysine and other side-chains. AGE formation is enhanced by the iron released. In contrast. the heme group is not destroyed during glycation of cytochrome c. where the sixth coordination position of the heme iron is not accessible to solvent ligands.

The process appears to involve the intramolecular displacement of water. The rate of cyclization is strongly influenced by the inductive effects of groups adjacent to the leaving group and to the entering group. The rate is also influenced by changes in the con-figuration of hydroxyl groups not directly involved in the reaction. This effect is attributed to interactions of the C-0 dipoles. There is a strong interaction possible between a hydroxyl group adjacent to the leaving group and the leaving group which strongly influences therate of cyclization.

The therapeutic effect of PM has been demonstrated in multiple animal models of diabetes and in phase II clinical trials. However. the mechanism of PM therapeutic action is poorly understood. One potential mechanism is scavenging of pathogenic reactive carbonyl species (RCS) found to be elevated in diabetes. We have suggested previously that the pathogenicity of RCS methylglyoxal (MGO) may be due to modification of critical arginine residues in matrix proteins and interference with renal cell−matrix interactions. We have also shown that this MGO effect can be inhibited by PM (Pedchenko et al. (2005) Diabetes 54. 2952−2960). These findings raised the questions of whether the effect is specific to MGO. whether other structurally different physiological RCS can act via the same mechanism. and whether their action is …,True,u6sN0KIAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC,60,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi701190s,13137966427221493660,/scholar?cites=13137966427221493660,,https://www3.nd.edu/~aseriann/Pyridoxamine.pdf,0,0,0

Owing to their superb mechanical and electrical properties. many potential applications have been proposed for them. However. polydispersity and poor solubility in both aqueous and non-aqueous solution impose a considerable challenge for their separation and assembly. which is required for many applications.

Hydrogen peroxide reacts with iron to form the extremely reactive and damaging hydroxyl radical via the Fenton reaction. Superoxide anion accelerates this reaction because the dismutation of superoxide leads to increased levels of hydrogen peroxide and because superoxide elevates the intracellular concentration of iron by attacking iron-sulfur proteins. We found that regulators of the Escherichia coli responses to oxidative stress. OxyR and SoxRS. activate the expression of Fur. the global repressor of ferric ion uptake. A transcript encoding Fur was induced by hydrogen peroxide in a wild-type strain but not in a ΔoxyR strain. and DNase I footprinting assays showed that OxyR binds to the fur promoter.

The oxidation of (6. 5)-enriched nanotubes in water with K2Ir(Cl)6 reveals a valence electron density of 0.2−0.4 e-/100 carbon atoms and a reduction potential of ∼800 mV versus NHE. The reduction potential of CNTs is found to increase with increasing band gap and to decrease with the introduction of an anionic dispersant. In light of this newly revealed redox chemistry of CNTs. we propose that the previously observed bleaching of the CNT absorbance spectrum at low pH is most likely a consequence of the oxidation of the nanotubes by oxygen.

In this work. we report on a study of the relationship between recognition sequences and the strength of their binding to the recognized CNT. We have chosen the (6.5) CNT and its corresponding DNA recognition sequences for investigation in this study. Binding strength is quantified by studying the kinetics of DNA replacement by a surfactant. which is monitored by following shifts in the absorption spectrum. We find that recognition ability correlates strongly with binding strength thus measured; addition or subtraction of just one base from the recognition sequence can enhance the kinetics of DNA displacement some 20-fold.

The essential step of the process is to deposit a dilute solution of DNA-wrapped carbon nanotubes (DNA-CNTs) on a SiO2 surface covered with a thin hydrophobic layer. This leads to deposition of fully aligned CNTs. The alignment pattern can be controlled by metal electrodes in the deposition region and can be quantitatively modeled by the behavior of a quasi-two-dimensional DNA-CNT nematic phase near the solution/SiO2 interface.

While the DX phase is thermodynamically more favored by an oxidized SWCNT mixture. the mildly reducing PEG phase is able to recover SWCNTs from oxidation and extract them successively from the DX phase.

Since shorter SWCNTs form clusters at higher polyethylene glycol concentration. gradual increase in PEG concentration results in length fractionated SWCNTs.

This approximation is related to the Franck–Condon principle. which in its simplest form holds that electronic transitions are instantaneous on the time scale of nuclear motion. The Condon approximation leads to a long-held assumption in Raman spectroscopy of carbon nanotubes: intensities arising from resonance with incident and scattered photons are equal.

Here we report quantitative measurements and analysis of the interactions between DNA-CNT hybrids at low salts. Condensation of DNA-CNT hybrids by neutral osmolytes leads to liquid crystalline phases. and varying the osmotic pressure modulates the interhybrid distance that is determined by x-ray diffraction. Thus obtained force-distance dependencies of DNA-CNT hybrids show a remarkable resemblance to that of double-stranded DNA with differences that can be largely accounted for by their different diameters.

In particular. the origin of the observed length-dependent spectral change and its effect on concentration determination has been the subject of considerable debate.

We related the severity of symptoms to the mutant load and predicted the clinical outcome of a given mutant load.

Leigh syndrome (or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is characterized by onset of symptoms typically between ages three and 12 months. often following a viral infection. Decompensation (often with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or CSF) during an intercurrent illness is typically associated with psychomotor retardation or regression. Neurologic features include hypotonia. spasticity. movement disorders (including chorea). cerebellar ataxia. and peripheral neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. About 50% of affected individuals die by age three years. most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure. NARP is characterized by proximal neurogenic muscle weakness with sensory neuropathy. ataxia. and pigmentary retinopathy. Onset of symptoms. particularly ataxia and learning difficulties. is often in early childhood. Individuals with NARP can be relatively stable for many years. but may suffer episodic deterioration. often in association with viral illnesses.

Despite this burden. the factors that precipitate the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remain to be fully elucidated. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with kidney disease in nondiabetic contexts. and increasing evidence suggests that dysfunctional renal mitochondria are pathological mediators of DKD. These complex organelles have a broad range of functions. including the generation of ATP.

FAD-dependent oxidoreductase domain-containing protein 1 (FOXRED1) was recently identified as a putative assembly factor and FOXRED1 mutations in patients cause complex I deficiency; however. its role in assembly is unknown. Here. we demonstrate that FOXRED1 is involved in mid-late stages of complex I assembly. In a patient with FOXRED1 mutations. the levels of mature complex I were markedly decreased. and a smaller ∼475 kDa subcomplex was detected. In the absence of FOXRED1. mtDNA-encoded complex I subunits are still translated and transiently assembled into a late stage ∼815 kDa intermediate; but instead of transitioning …,True,yCbVBT4AAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC,58,https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article-abstract/24/10/2952/623776,11595283351530728847,/scholar?cites=11595283351530728847,,https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/24/10/2952/623776,0,0,0

Perturbations of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools are a recognized cause of mitochondrial genomic instability; therefore. we determined DNA copy number and dNTP levels in mitochondria of two models of MPV17 deficiency. In Mpv17 ablated mice. liver mitochondria showed substantial decreases in the levels of dGTP and dTTP and severe mitochondrial DNA depletion. whereas the dNTP pool was not significantly altered in kidney and brain mitochondria that had near normal levels of DNA. The shortage of mitochondrial dNTPs in Mpv17-/- liver slows the DNA replication in the organelle. as evidenced by the elevated level of replication intermediates. Quiescent fibroblasts of MPV17-mutant patients recapitulate key features of the primary affected tissue of the Mpv17-/- mice. displaying virtual absence of the protein. decreased dNTP levels and mitochondrial DNA depletion. Notably. the mitochondrial DNA loss in the patients’ quiescent fibroblasts was prevented and rescued by deoxynucleoside supplementation. Thus. our study establishes dNTP insufficiency in the mitochondria as the cause of mitochondrial DNA depletion in MPV17 deficiency. and identifies deoxynucleoside supplementation as a potential therapeutic strategy for MPV17-related disease. Moreover. changes in the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial deoxynucleotide homeostasis indicate a remodeling of nucleotide metabolism in MPV17 disease models. which suggests mitochondria lacking functional …,True,yCbVBT4AAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC,57,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005779,13302402364897895574,/scholar?cites=13302402364897895574,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005779,0,0,0

116909,A new case of malonyl coenzyme A decarboxylase deficiency presenting with cardiomyopathy,1997,S Yano and L Sweetman and DR Thorburn and S Mofidi and JC Williams,156,European journal of pediatrics,5,382-383,Springer-Verlag, A new case of mitochondrial malonyl coenzyme A decarboxylase deficiency is described. The patient presented with an initial episode of metabolic acidosis. seizures. hypoglycemia. and cardiac failure at 2 months of age which slowly resolved. Subsequent evaluations at 4 years of age for developmental delay revealed a prominent elevation of malonic acid in urine. Malonyl carnitine was also elevated. The activity of malonyl CoA decarboxylase in cultured fibroblasts was 7% of normal. Conclusion Malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency may result in inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. which may account for the cardiomyopathy.,True,yCbVBT4AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,47,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s004310050619.pdf,2968214118998234451,/scholar?cites=2968214118998234451,,,0,0,0

In one such disorder. Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS). large-scale hetero-plasmic mtDNA deletions are often found. We describe a 14-year-old boy with clinical features of KSS. plus some additional features. Analysis of the entire mitochondrial genome by the polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting revealed a 7864-bp mtDNA deletion. heteroplasmic in its tissue distribution. DNA sequencing established that the deletion was between nucleotides 6238 and 14103. and flanked by a 4-bp (TCCT) direct repeat sequence. Deletions between direct repeats have been hypothesised to occur by a slipped-mismatching or illegitimate recombination event. or following the DNA cleavage action of topoisomerase II.

116911,Morphological correlates of mitochondrial dysfunction in children,2000,CW Chow and DR Thorburn,15,,suppl_2,68-78,Oxford University Press,Morphological studies have traditionally played a major role in the study of adults with suspected mitochondrial diseases. Here we review their role in the investigation of paediatric patients. The morphological changes may be macroscopic. such as developmental abnormalities of the brain in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. including ectopic inferior olives and the absence of corpus callosum and pyramids. Other changes are histological. such as rarefaction of the neuropil and endothelial prominence in Leigh syndrome. and spongiosis with neuronal loss and gliosis in Alpers disease. The ragged-red fibres typical of mitochondrial disease in adults are only rarely seen in skeletal muscle biopsies from children. On the other hand. dramatic ultrastructural changes involving the mitochondria may be seen in many organs. including the liver. heart and intestine.

This bifunctional enzyme comprises three independent folding units: an epidermal growth factor domain. a membrane-binding motif and an enzymatic domain. Two adjacent but spatially distinct active sites were found for its haem-dependent peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities. The cyclooxygenase active site is created by a long. hydrophobic channel that is the site of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug binding.

Here we present the 3.4 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of PGHS isoform-1 inactivated by the potent aspirin analogue 2-bromoacetoxy-benzoic acid. Acetylation by this analogue abolishes cyclooxygenase activity by steric blockage of the active-site channel and not through a large conformational change. We observe two rotameric states of the acetyl-serine side chain which block the channel to different extents. a result which may explain the dissimilar effects of aspirin on the two PGHS isoforms.

However. these deceptively simple. amphipathic molecules exhibit complex behavior when they self-associate and interact with other molecules. The phase behavior and assembled structures of detergents are markedly influenced not only by their unique chemical and physical properties but also by concentration. ionic conditions. and the presence of other lipids and proteins. In this minireview. we discuss the various aggregate forms detergents assume and some misconceptions about their structure.

The unusual aspects of porin crystallization are consistent with the micellar interactions involved in crystal formation. The resulting porin crystals are relatively sensitive to the environment. Care must be taken in handling and mounting crystals for X-ray analysis to avoid significant or abrupt changes in the solvent or detergent environment and uncontrolled variations of temperature. Porin has proven to be rather useful for the optimization of conditions to crystallize membrane proteins as it is very stable over a wide range of conditions. Crystallization experiments (at 20°) are successful also using several other detergents with a moderate to high carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Initial problems with reproducibility of porin crystallization revealed that a high degree of purity of this protein is required. and that the removal of tightly …,True,Uu4tMTcAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,190,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0076687986250272,4820301752474077741,/scholar?cites=4820301752474077741,,,0,0,0

In contrast. the radical signals seen with the Y385F and Y348F/Y385F mutants were 23 gauss (g=2.004) and 22 gauss (g=2.0037). In short. tyrosyl radicals are formed even in the absence of both Tyr348 and Tyr385. In Y345F containing mutants. a cluster of aromatic amino acids which surrounds the heme group may provide an alternate …,True,Uu4tMTcAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,47,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X85712375,5255612411326844774,/scholar?cites=5255612411326844774,,,0,0,0
