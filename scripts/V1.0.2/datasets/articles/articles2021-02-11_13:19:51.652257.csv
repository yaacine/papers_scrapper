The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho regulates such remodeling. but the underlying mechanisms of this regulation remain unclear. Cofilin exhibits actin-depolymerizing activity that is inhibited as a result of its phosphorylation by LIM-kinase. Cofilin was phosphorylated in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells during lysophosphatidic acid–induced. Rho-mediated neurite retraction. This phosphorylation was sensitive to Y-27632. a specific inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinase ROCK. ROCK. which is a downstream effector of Rho. did not phosphorylate cofilin directly but phosphorylated LIM-kinase. which in turn was activated to phosphorylate cofilin. Overexpression of LIM-kinase in HeLa cells induced the formation of actin stress fibers in a Y-27632–sensitive manner.

In Drosophila. loss of ssh function dramatically increased levels of both F actin and phospho-cofilin (P cofilin) and disorganized epidermal cell morphogenesis. In mammalian cells. human SSH homologs (hSSHs) suppressed LIMK1-induced actin reorganization. Furthermore. SSH and the hSSHs dephosphorylated P cofilin in cultured cells and in cell-free assays.

In this study. to further understand the biological role of the interaction of Gas6 with PS. we exam ined the effect of Gas6 on the uptake of PS liposomes by macrophages. In vitro phagocy tosis studies showed that Gas6 enhanced the uptake of PS liposomes approximately threefold and that the interaction of Gas6 with the surface of macrophages was essen tial for this enhancement.

Like that of PS liposomes. the uptake of apop totic cells by macrophages was also enhanced. approximately twofold. in the presence of Gas6. These findings suggest that Gas6 may help phagocytic cells recognize cells with PS exposed on their surfaces. which is considered to be one of the mechanisms for clearing away dying cells. Thus.

The encoded protein. which we termed'Sky'. contains an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and a unique extracellular domain with two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and two fibronectin type III (FN III) domains. The overall structure of Sky is homologous to the reported sequence of the oncogenic Axl/Ufo receptor tyrosine kinase. Phylogenetic analysis in the tyrosine kinase domain shows that Sky. Axl/Ufo. Ark. and v-Ryk form a sub-family distinct from other tyrosine kinases. Northern blot analysis revealed that sky mRNA is expressed predominantly in brain and faintly in tissues of other organs.

Inc.,We cloned and characterized a novel immunoglobulin superfamily gene from the cDNA library of adult mouse testis. This gene was expressed in the spermatogenic cells and hence termed SgIGSF. The predicted SgIGSF protein was composed of 445 amino‐acid residues and contained a signal peptide. three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)‐like domains. a transmembranous domain. and a cytoplasmic domain. SgIGSF mRNA consisted of two size species. 2.1‐ and 4.5‐kb in length. Besides testis. SgIGSF mRNA was also expressed in a variety of organs. including the cerebrum. liver. kidney. and epididymis. The testis and liver expressed both the 2.1‐ and 4.5‐kb transcripts. whereas the cerebrum and epididymis predominantly expressed the 4.5‐kb one.

Using as a probe a cDNA fragment of human LIMK. we isolated from a rat brain cDNA library cDNA clones encoding two distinct protein kinases (termed LIMK-1 and LIMK-2) related to human LIMK. LIMK-1 shares with human LIMK 95% of the total 647 amino acids and is probably a rat equivalent of human LIMK. LIMK-2 has an overall sequence and a domain structure similar to that of human LIMK and rat LIMK-1. but overall identity is 50-51% at the amino acid level. Like human LIMK. the protein kinase domains of rat LIMK-1 and-2 contain a characteristic sequence DLNSHN in subdomain VIB and a highly basic insert between subdomain VII and VIII. LIMK-1 and-2 are therefore closely related but distinct members of a novel LIM-containing protein kinase subfamily. Several forms of LIMK-2 transcripts encoding proteins that are N-terminally modified and/or C-terminally truncated are generated by alternative splicing or alternative initiation. Northern blot analysis revealed the expression of LIMK-1 mRNA predominantly in the brain and the expression of LIMK-2 mRNA in various tissues in the rat. Antibody raised against LIMK-1 specifically immunoprecipitated and identified in Rat2 fibroblast cells a 72 kDa protein. which has no detectable autophosphorylating activity but is capable of phosphorylating serine and threonine residues of myelin basic protein. by in vitro kinase reaction.

Scatchard analysis of HGF binding in liver. spleen. kidney. lung. and adrenal gland revealed the presence of a single class of high affinity receptor with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 20–30 pM. The maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) was determined to be 400–3.000 sites per ng of plasma membrane protein. the highest number being in the liver. Such a wide distribution of a high affinity HGF receptor indicates that HGF may be a multi-functional growth factor. targeting to a variety of organs. and not restricted to liver.

This is followed by membrane contraction and the formation of Ag receptor microclusters that initiate the signaling reactions that lead to lymphocyte activation. Breakdown of the submembrane cytoskeleton is likely to be required for the cytoskeleton reorganization that drives cell spreading and for removing physical barriers that limit Ag receptor mobility. In this report. we show that Ag receptor signaling via the Rap GTPases promotes the dephosphorylation and activation of the actin-severing protein cofilin and that this results in increased severing of cellular actin filaments. Moreover. we show that this cofilin-mediated actin severing is critical for the changes in actin dynamics that drive B and T cell spreading. for the formation of BCR microclusters. and for the increased mobility of BCR …,True,k3RD2vQAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC,85,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/187/11/5887.short,8706584785666248955,/scholar?cites=8706584785666248955,,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/187/11/5887.full.pdf,0,0,0

LIM‐kinase 1 (LIMK1) regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization by phosphorylating and inactivating cofilin. an actin filament‐depolymerizing and ‐severing protein. We now report that LIMK1 is cleaved and activated during anti‐Fas antibody‐induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. The cleavage and activation of LIMK1 were blocked by z‐DEVD‐fmk. an inhibitor for caspase‐3 or related proteases. thus indicating that caspase‐3‐like proteases are responsible for LIMK1 cleavage. The caspase‐mediated cleavage of LIMK1 occurs at Asp‐240. a site at the N‐terminal side of the protein kinase domain. which leads to the production of an N‐terminally truncated. constitutively active LIMK1 fragment.

To elucidate the functional roles of LIMKs in vivo during developmental processes. we attempted to isolate the cDNA encoding a Drosophila homolog of LIMK (DLIMK) and identified two isoforms of DLIMK transcripts coding for proteins with 1235 and 1257 amino acids. possessing the structure composed of two LIM domains. a PDZ domain. a protein kinase domain. and an unusual long C-terminal extension. In situ hybridization analysis in Drosophila embryos detected the uniformly distributed DLIMK mRNA in stages 2 to 5.

115293,Cytochalasin D acts as an inhibitor of the actin–cofilin interaction,2012,Kazuyasu Shoji and Kazumasa Ohashi and Kaori Sampei and Masato Oikawa and Kensaku Mizuno,424,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1,52-57,Academic Press,Cofilin. a key regulator of actin filament dynamics. binds to G- and F-actin and promotes actin filament turnover by stimulating depolymerization and severance of actin filaments. In this study. cytochalasin D (CytoD). a widely used inhibitor of actin dynamics. was found to act as an inhibitor of the G-actin–cofilin interaction by binding to G-actin. CytoD also inhibited the binding of cofilin to F-actin and decreased the rate of both actin polymerization and depolymerization in living cells. CytoD altered cellular F-actin organization but did not induce net actin polymerization or depolymerization. These results suggest that CytoD inhibits actin filament dynamics in cells via multiple mechanisms. including the well-known barbed-end capping mechanism and as shown in this study. the inhibition of G- and F-actin binding to cofilin.,True,k3RD2vQAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C,52,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X12011588,2235011652717055960,/scholar?cites=2235011652717055960,,,0,0,0

115298,Mechanisms of resistance to cisplatin,2001,Maria Kartalou and John M Essigmann,478,,1-2,23-43,Elsevier,The use of cisplatin in cancer chemotherapy is limited by acquired or intrinsic resistance of cells to the drug. Cisplatin enters the cells and its chloride ligands are replaced by water. forming aquated species that react with nucleophilic sites in cellular macromolecules. The presence of the cisplatin adducts in DNA is thought to trigger cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Knowledge of the mechanism of action of cisplatin has improved our understanding of resistance. Decerased intracellular concentration due to decreased drug uptake. increased reflux or increased inactivation by sulfhydryl molecules such as glutathione can cause resistance to cisplatin.

A mechanism heretofore not addressed is that DNA damage may titrate essential DNA-binding proteins away from their natural sites of action. This report shows that the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription factor hUBF (human upstream binding factor) binds with striking affinity (Kd(app) approximately 60 pM) to the intrastrand cis-[Pt(NH3)2](2+-d(GpG) crosslink formed by the anticancer drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin).

115338,Cisplatin.,1999,Elizabeth E Trimmer and John M Essigmann,34,,,191-211,,Cisplatin is a widely used anti-cancer drug that is exceptionally effective against testicular cancer. trans-DDP. the geometric isomer of cisplatin. is ineffective as a chemotherapeutic agent. The anti-tumour activity of cisplatin is generally attributed to its formation of DNA adducts. both intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks. which induce structural distortions in DNA. The DNA adducts of cisplatin are thought to mediate its cytotoxic effects by inhibiting DNA replication and transcription and. ultimately. by inducing programmed cell death. or apoptosis. The adducts of both cis-and trans-DDP are removed from DNA by the nucleotide-excision-repair pathway. Cellular proteins possessing certain DNA-binding motifs. including the HMG domain. bind selectively to DNA modified by cisplatin. but not to DNA adducts of trans-DDP; evidence suggests a possible role for these proteins in modulating cisplatin cytotoxicity. Both intrinsic and drug-induced resistance often limit the success of cisplatin; several specific mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been identified.,True,TqAysx4AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,157,https://europepmc.org/article/med/10730196,5913196096694209642,/scholar?cites=5913196096694209642,,,0,0,0

A circular DNA duplex with an intrastrand d(GpG) crosslink positioned at a specific site was synthesized. Human cell extracts were unable to induce repair synthesis in a 29-base-pair region encompassing the adduct or in adjacent regions.

The toxicity of cisplatin probably results from its ability to form DNA adducts that inhibit polymerases. Blocked replication represents a particular challenge for tumor cells. which are committed to unremitting division. Recombination provides a mechanism by which replication can proceed despite the presence of lesions and therefore could be significant for managing cisplatin toxicity.Results: Recombination-deficient Escherichia coli mutants were strikingly sensitive to cisplatin when compared with the parental strain. Our data identified both daughter-strand gap and double-strand break recombination pathways as critical for survival following treatment with cisplatin.

Here we present an extensive analysis of viral sequences from HIV-1 infected volunteers from the first “mechanism validation” phase II clinical trial of a mutagenic base analog in which individuals previously treated with antiviral drugs received 1600 mg of KP1461 twice per day for 124 days. Plasma viral loads were not reduced. and overall levels of viral mutation were not increased during this short-term study. however. the mutation spectrum of HIV was altered. A large number (N = 105 per sample) of sequences were analyzed. each derived from individual HIV-1 RNA templates. after 0. 56 and 124 days of therapy from 10 treated and 10 untreated control individuals (>7.1 million base pairs of unique viral templates were sequenced). We found that private mutations. those not found in more than one viral sequence and likely to have occurred in the most recent rounds of replication. increased in treated individuals relative to controls after 56 (p = 0.038) and 124 (p = 0.002) days of drug treatment. The spectrum of mutations observed in the treated group showed an excess of A to G and G to A mutations (p = 0.01). and to a lesser extent T to C and C to T mutations (p = 0.09). as predicted by the mechanism of action of the drug.

The strategy involves the synthesis of bifunctional molecules capable of forming DNA adducts that have high affinity for specific proteins in target cells. It is proposed that the association of such proteins with damaged sites in DNA can compromise protein function and/or DNA repair resulting in increased toxicity. We describe the synthesis of a bifunctional compound consisting of an aniline mustard linked to the 7α position of estradiol. This novel compound can form covalent DNA adducts that have high affinity for the estrogen receptor. Breast cancer cells that express high levels of the estrogen receptor showed increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of the new compound. ,True,TqAysx4AAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,55,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja017344p,2948560028309946635,/scholar?cites=2948560028309946635,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4095803/,0,0,0

These lesions are among the many produced when alkylating agents interact with DNA and are the two most widely believed to account for the mutagenicity that follows the alkylation event. The shuttle vectors were transfected in parallel into Chinese hamster ovary cells that were either proficient (mex+) or deficient (mex-) in an endogenous alkyltransferase protein. The vectors integrated into the genome of the host. and the lesions were replicated along with the host chromosome. A portion of the integrated vector encompassing the originally adducted site was subsequently amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from the host genome to mediate analysis of mutation frequency and type.

GSH itself is a critical factor in maintaining the cellular redox balance and has been demonstrated to be involved in regulation of cell signalling and repair pathways. Enhanced expression of various enzymes involved in GSH metabolism. including glutathione peroxidases. γ-glutamyl cysteinyl synthetase (γ-GCS). glutathione S-transferases (GST) and membrane proteins belonging to the ATP-binding cassette family. such as the multidrug resistance associated protein. have all been demonstrated to play a prominent role in cellular resistance towards oxidative stress. This review stresses the fact that a co-ordinate interplay between these systems is essential for efficient protection against oxidative stress.,True,lhJNez4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,372,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668901000771,7778992688930522564,/scholar?cites=7778992688930522564,,,0,0,0

Their action was accompanied by malondialdehyde formation. and was partly prevented by desferrioxamine and the antioxidant N.N′-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine. This points to a prooxidant character of their cytotoxicity. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) has been obtained to describe the cytotoxicity of 13 polyphenolic antioxidants belonging to three different groups (flavonoids. derivatives of gallic and caffeic acid): log cL50 (μM)=(2.7829±0.2339)+(1.2734±0.4715) Ep/2 (V)−(0.3438±0.0582) log P (r2=0.8129). where cL50 represents the concentration for 50% cell survival.

These quinone methides are suggested to be the active alkylating DNA-reactive intermediates. Recent results have demonstrated the formation of quercetin DNA adducts in exposed cells in vitro. The question that remains to be answered is why these genotoxic characteristics of quercetin are not reflected by carcinogenicity.

However. the role of these factors is not well understood. Hence. the aim of this study was to systematically investigate the role of surface charge. oxidative stress and possible involvement of mitochondria in the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon exposure of rat macrophage NR8383 cells to silicon nanoparticles. For this aim highly monodisperse (size 1.6 ± 0.2 nm) and well-characterized Si core nanoparticles (Si NP) were used with a surface charge that depends on the specific covalently bound organic monolayers: positively charged Si NP-NH2. neutral Si NP-N3 and negatively charged Si NP-COOH. Positively charged Si NP-NH2 proved to be more cytotoxic in terms of reducing mitochondrial metabolic activity and effects on phagocytosis than neutral Si NP-N3. while negatively charged Si NP-COOH showed very little or no cytotoxicity. Si NP-NH2 produced the highest level of intracellular ROS. followed by Si NP-N3 and Si NP-COOH; the latter did not induce any intracellular ROS production. A similar trend in ROS production was observed in incubations with an isolated mitochondrial fraction from rat liver tissue in the presence of Si NP. Finally. vitamin E and vitamin C induced protection against the cytotoxicity of the Si NP-NH2 and Si NP-N3. corroborating the role of oxidative stress in the mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of these Si NP. Surface charge of Si-core nanoparticles plays an important role in determining their cytotoxicity.

The nature and type of mono- and diglutathionyl adducts formed from quercetin. taxifolin. luteolin. fisetin. and 3.3‘.4‘-trihydroxyflavone show how several structural elements influence the quinone/quinone methide chemistry of flavonoids. In line with previous findings. glutathionyl adduct formation for quercetin occurs at positions C6 and C8 of the A ring. due to the involvement of quinone methide-type intermediates. Elimination of the possibilities for efficient quinone methide formation by (i) the absence of the C3−OH group (luteolin).

Comparison of the pKa values to theoretically calculated parameters for the neutral and deprotonated forms indicates that the pH-dependent increase in radical scavenging activity of the catechins is due to an increase of electron-donating ability upon deprotonation. The data also reveal that the radical scavenging activity of the catechins containing the pyrogallol (or catechol) and the galloyl moiety over the whole pH range is due to an additive effect of these two independent radical scavenging structural elements.

115433,Radical scavenging capacity of wine anthocyanins is strongly pH-dependent,2005,Tomasz Borkowski and Henryk Szymusiak and Anna Gliszczyńska-Świgło and Ivonne MCM Rietjens and Bożena Tyrakowska,53,Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,14,5526-5534,American Chemical Society,The radical scavenging capacity of red wine anthocyanins was quantified by the so-called TEAC assay with special emphasis on the influence of pH and conjugation on this activity. The pH appears to be a dominant factor in the radical scavenging capacity of wine anthocyanins. with higher pH values increasing this capacity significantly. On the basis of the pKa values for deprotonation and theoretical calculations. it could be concluded that the effect is due to an increase in intrinsic radical scavenging capacity upon deprotonation. The data also reveal that the reduction in radical scavenging activity of anthocyanins upon their conjugation can. at least in part. be ascribed to an increase in pKa values upon conjugation. Altogether. the results obtained provide molecular insight into factors that influence radical scavenging potential of anthocyanins and reveal that the radical scavenging-mediated supposed beneficial …,True,lhJNez4AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,112,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf0478556,3254086628901974070,/scholar?cites=3254086628901974070,,,0,0,0

The results show a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of GSTP1-1 by quercetin. GSTP1-1 activity is completely inhibited upon 1 h incubation with 100 μM quercetin or 2 h incubation with 25 μM quercetin. whereas 1 and 10 μM quercetin inhibit GSTP1-1 activity to a significant extent reaching a maximum of 25 and 42% inhibition respectively after 2 h. Co-incubation with tyrosinase greatly enhances the rate of inactivation. whereas co-incubation with ascorbic acid or glutathione prevents this inhibition. Addition of glutathione upon complete inactivation of GSTP1-1 partially restores the activity. Inhibition studies with the GSTP1-1 mutants C47S.

This is of importance because (i) ERβ has been postulated to play a role in modulating ERα-mediated cell proliferation. (ii) genistein and quercetin may be agonists for both receptor types and (iii) the ratio of ERα to ERβ is known to vary between tissues. Using human osteosarcoma (U2OS) ERα or ERβ reporter cells it was shown that compared to estradiol (E2). genistein and quercetin have not only a relatively greater preference for ERβ but also a higher maximal potential for activating ERβ-mediated gene expression.

In vitro toxicity tests provide in vitro concentration-response curves for specific target cells. whereas in vivo dose-response curves are regularly used for human risk assessment. The present study shows an approach to predict in vivo dose-response curves for developmental toxicity by combining in vitro toxicity data and in silico kinetic modeling.

One mechanism relates to the different ultimate cellular effects of activation of estrogen receptor (ER) α. promoting cell proliferation. and of ERβ. promoting apoptosis. with the major soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein activating especially ERβ. A second mode of action includes the role of epigenetics. including effects of isoflavones on DNA methylation. histone modification and miRNA expression patterns.

The model for the reactive flavin intermediate (C4a-hydroperoxyflavin) bound to PH was constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of the enzyme−substrate complex. A potential energy surface (PES) was calculated as a function of the reaction coordinates for hydroxylation of phenol (on C6) and for proton transfer from phenol (O1) to an active-site base Asp54 (OD1). The results support a reaction mechanism in which phenol is activated through deprotonation by Asp54. after which the phenolate is hydroxylated through an electrophilic aromatic substitution.

Size and surface characteristics are often considered to be important factors in the cellular interactions of these PNP. although systematic investigations on the role of surface properties on cellular interactions and toxicity of PNP are scarce. Fluorescent. monodisperse tri-block copolymer nanoparticles with different sizes (45 and 90 nm) and surface charges (positive and negative) were synthesized. characterized and studied for uptake and cytotoxicity in NR8383 and Caco-2 cells. All types of PNP were taken up by the cells.

It was shown that the reaction was not inhibited by the addition of scavengers of superoxide anion or hydroxyl radicals. which demonstrates that the reaction mechanism differs from that of the aromatic hydroxylation catalyzed by a horseradish peroxidase/dihydroxyfumarate system.Additional experiments with 18O‐labelled H218O2 demonstrated that the oxygen incoiporated into aniline to give 4‐aminophenol originates from H2O2. Furthermore. it was found that the addition of ascorbic acid efficiently blocks all peroxidase‐type reactions that can be catalyzed by the MP8/H2O2 system. but does not inhibit the aromatic hydroxylation of aniline and phenol derivatives. Together. these observations exclude reaction mechanisms for the aromatic hydroxylation that …,True,lhJNez4AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,83,https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0232h.x,4659434732546320904,/scholar?cites=4659434732546320904,,https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0232h.x,0,0,0

115449,Quenching of quercetin quinone/quinone methides by different thiolate scavengers: stability and reversibility of conjugate formation,2003,Hanem M Awad and Marelle G Boersma and Sjef Boeren and Peter J Van Bladeren and Jacques Vervoort and Ivonne MCM Rietjens,16,Chemical research in toxicology,7,822-831,American Chemical Society,Oxidation of flavonoids with a catechol structural motif in their B ring leads to formation of flavonoid quinone/quinone methides. which rapidly react with GSH to give reversible glutathionyl flavonoid adducts. Results of the present study demonstrate that as a thiol-scavenging agent for this reaction Cys is preferred over GSH and N-acetylcysteine. The preferential scavenging by Cys over GSH reported in the present study appeared not to provide a basis for detection of thiol-based flavonoid conjugates in biological systems. This is because physiological concentrations of GSH are substantially higher than those of Cys. which was shown to shift the balance of thiol conjugate formation in favor of glutathionyl adduct formation. Furthermore. the cysteinyl quercetin adducts. although not showing the reversible nature of the glutathionyl conjugates. appeared nevertheless to be unstable.

In order to examine the effects of quercetin on lipid metabolism. mice received a mild-high-fat diet without (control) or with supplementation of 0.33% (w/w) quercetin for 12 weeks. Gas chromatography and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance were used to quantitatively measure serum lipid profiles. Whole genome microarray analysis of liver tissue was used to identify possible mechanisms underlying altered circulating lipid levels. Body weight. energy intake and hepatic lipid accumulation did not differ significantly between the quercetin and the control group. In serum of quercetin-fed mice. triglycerides (TG) were decreased with 14% (p<0.001) and total poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were increased with 13% (p<0.01). Palmitic acid. oleic acid. and linoleic acid were all decreased by 9–15% (p<0.05) in quercetin-fed mice. Both palmitic acid and oleic acid can be oxidized by omega (ω)-oxidation. Gene expression profiling showed that quercetin increased hepatic lipid metabolism. especially ω-oxidation. At the gene level. this was reflected by the up-regulation of cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 4a10. Cyp4a14. Cyp4a31 and Acyl-CoA thioesterase 3 (Acot3). Two relevant regulators. cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Por. rate limiting for cytochrome P450s) and the transcription factor constitutive androstane receptor (Car; official symbol Nr1i3) were also up-regulated in the quercetin-fed mice.

C60 exposure had a significant effect on cocoon production. juvenile growth rate and mortality. These endpoints were used to model effects on the population level. This demonstrated reduced population growth rate with increasing C60 concentrations. Furthermore. a shift in stage structure was shown for C60 exposed populations. i.e. a larger proportion of juveniles. This result implies that the lower juvenile growth rate due to exposure to C60 resulted in a larger proportion of juveniles. despite increased mortality among juveniles. Overall. this study indicates that C60 exposure may seriously affect earthworm populations.

The flavonoid o-quinones were generated using horseradish peroxidase. and upon purification by HPLC. the glutathionyl adducts were identified by LC/MS as well as 1H and 13C NMR. The major pH effect observed for the glutathione conjugation of taxifolin and luteolin quinone is on the rate of taxifolin and luteolin conversion and. as a result. on the ratio of mono- to diglutathione adduct formation. With fisetin. 3.3‘.4‘-trihydroxyflavone. and quercetin. decreasing the pH results in a pathway in which glutathionyl adduct formation occurs in the C ring of the flavonoid. being initiated by hydration of the quinone and H2O adduct formation also in the C ring of the flavonoid.

First an inventory was made of botanical compounds that are of possible concern for human health because of their genotoxic and/or carcinogenic properties. In total. 30 botanical compounds were selected and subsequently judged for their actual genotoxic and/or carcinogenic potential. Among the 30 compounds considered. 18 compounds were judged to be both genotoxic and carcinogenic. Interestingly. the majority of these compounds belong to the group of alkenylbenzenes or unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Subsequently. based on available carcinogenicity data and estimated daily human exposure that was determined focusing on the intake from PFS. the Margin of Exposure (MOE) was calculated for the alkenylbenzenes estragole. methyleugenol. safrole and β-asarone. Calculating the MOEs for intake estimates of these alkenylbenzenes from PFS resulted in MOE values that were generally lower than 10.000 and often lower than 100. In some cases the MOE was even below 10 meaning that the estimated daily intake is in the range of dose levels causing malignant tumors in experimental animals. This result indicates that the use of PFS containing the genotoxic carcinogens estragole. methyleugenol. safrole or β-asarone might raise a potential concern for human health and would be of high priority for risk management.,True,lhJNez4AAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C,75,https://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/178088/2/Levels%20of%20Genotoxic%20and%20Carcinogenic%20Compounds%20in%20Plant%20Food%20Supplements%20and%20Associated%20Risk%20Assessment.pdf,9752055106285387446,/scholar?cites=9752055106285387446,,https://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/178088/2/Levels%20of%20Genotoxic%20and%20Carcinogenic%20Compounds%20in%20Plant%20Food%20Supplements%20and%20Associated%20Risk%20Assessment.pdf,0,0,0

Currently. there is an increasing awareness among safety experts and regulators of risks associated with the use of botanicals and botanical ingredients in food including food supplements. It is becoming clear that “natural” does not equal “safe” and that. in modern society. adverse health effects can occur as a result of (mis)use. With the growing awareness of these issues efforts to ensure safety of botanicals and botanical ingredients are also increasing. Several guidance documents on safety assessment of botanicals and botanical preparations to be used as ingredients in food and food supplements have been published. although. at present. relevant legislative frameworks and …,True,lhJNez4AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,74,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378427408001793,7777001768130358528,/scholar?cites=7777001768130358528,,,0,0,0

In the present study. the consequences of catechol O-methylation for the pH-dependent radical scavenging properties of quercetin and luteolin were characterized both experimentally and theoretically. Comparison of the pKa values to the pH-dependent TEAC profiles reveals that O-methylation not only affects the TEAC as such but also modulates the effect of changing pH on this radical scavenging activity due to an effect on the pKa for deprotonation.

The natural logarithm of the kcat value for the conversion of the phenolic substrates correlates with the calculated energy of the reactive electrons in the highest occupied molecular orbital of the substrate (r= 0.85). This observation supports the hypothesis that at physiological pH (7.6) and 25°C. in the absence of monovalent anions. the nucleophilic attack of the electrons in the highest occupied molecular orbital of the substrate on the C(4a)‐hydroperoxyflavin enzyme intermediate is of major importance in determining the overall rate of catalysis.

Most in vitro research conducted to elucidate the modes of action of flavonoids uses flavonoid aglycones. but not their circulating conjugated metabolites. Conjugation alters the physico-chemical properties of flavonoids and it is widely assumed that this can affect their biological activity. This article gives a state-of-the-art overview of scientific literature reporting on the effect of metabolic conjugation on the biological activity of flavonoids. The biological activity of flavonoid aglycones is compared to that of their conjugates for a broad range of endpoints. Even though there is only limited literature available. it is shown that contrary to common belief. conjugation does not always decrease the biological activity of flavonoids. There are also endpoints which are unaffected by conjugation. and endpoints on which the conjugates have a higher or …,True,lhJNez4AAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC,62,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2012/fo/c2fo30065f,13838332015788358739,/scholar?cites=13838332015788358739,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bfb3/122a5a45a1ca395aa70aa59bc978e95d8318.pdf#page=25,0,0,0

In laboratory assays extracts from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L). clove (Syzygium aromaticum L). betelvine (Piper betle L). and sweet flag (Acorus calamus L) were most effective in killing the nematode. with an EC 50 that was 5-10 times lower than the EC 50 of the synthetic pesticides chlorpyrifos. carbosulfan and deltamethrin. The shapes of the dead nematodes differed in a characteristic way. and groups of pesticides and plant extracts could clearly be distinguished based on this phenomenon. which may be an indicator for the modes of action of the tested pesticides. In a greenhouse bioassay clove bud and betelvine were tested as mulch. Experiments revealed that the total number of live nematodes on roots of pepper plants treated with mulch of the clove bud was 7% of that of the controls and did not differ significantly from that of plants treated with the recommended synthetic pesticide carbofuran. The application of clove buds as a botanical pesticide for future use against nematodes is highly promising since clove is the 6th major plant grown on Bangka Island. and the market value of clove has decreased sharply over the last years.,True,lhJNez4AAAAJ:BOlwja0KXvYC,61,https://benthamopen.com/ABSTRACT/TONPJ-2-77,4223675021738560963,/scholar?cites=4223675021738560963,,https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TONPJ/TONPJ-2-77.pdf,0,0,0

A clear correlation between In kcat for the conversion of a series of 4‐hydroxylated substrates and their E(HOMO) leads to the hypothesis that Frontier orbital HOMO characteristics [E(HOMO) and HOMO density on C3] of the substrates are the predominant factor in regulating the fate of a benzoate derivative at the active site of the enzyme. The HOMO characteristics can be used to explain whether a compound will be converted by the enzyme or merely acts as an effector.

Recently we have developed physiologically based biokinetic (PBBK) models for rat and human predicting bioactivation of estragole. These PBBK models. however. predict only kinetic characteristics. The present study describes the extension of the PBBK model to a so-called physiologically based biodynamic (PBBD) model predicting in vivo DNA adduct formation of estragole in rat liver. This PBBD model was developed using in vitro data on DNA adduct formation in rat primary hepatocytes exposed to 1′-hydroxyestragole.

Screening libraries of fragment-sized compounds by NMR or X-ray crystallography demonstrates that such ‘hot spot’ regions bind a large variety of small organic molecules. and that a relatively high ‘hit rate’ is predictive of target sites that are likely to bind drug-like ligands with high affinity. Our goal is to determine the ‘hot spots’ computationally rather than experimentally. Results: We have developed the FTMAP algorithm that performs global search of the entire protein surface for regions that bind a number of small organic probe molecules.

However. a mutation of V266E in the dimer interface activates the protease in the absence of chain cleavage. We show that low concentrations of the pseudo-activated procaspase-3 kill mammalian cells rapidly and. importantly. this protein is not cleaved nor is it inhibited efficiently by the endogenous regulator XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis). The 1.63 Å (1 Å = 0.1 nm) structure of the variant demonstrates that the mutation is accommodated at the dimer interface to generate an enzyme with substantially the same activity and specificity as wild-type caspase-3. Structural modelling predicts that the interface mutation prevents the intersubunit linker from binding in the dimer interface. allowing the active sites to form in the procaspase in the absence of cleavage.

We present the crystal structures of the Ras-GppNHp/Raf-RBD and RasQ61L-GppNHp/Raf-RBD complexes. which. in combination with MD simulations. reveal differences in allosteric interactions leading from the Ras/Raf interface to the Ras calcium-binding site and to the remote Raf-RBD loop L4. In the presence of Raf. the RasQ61L mutant has a rigid switch II relative to the wild-type and increased flexibility at the interface with switch I. which propagates across Raf-RBD. We show that in addition to local …,True,KzmG7G8AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,152,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212615000040,13612343193943303069,/scholar?cites=13612343193943303069,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212615000040,0,0,0

Upon activation of the allosteric switch. there is a shift in helix 3/loop 7 associated with a disorder to order transition in the active site. Here. we use a combination of multiple solvent crystal structures and computational solvent mapping (FTMap) to determine binding site hot spots in the “off” and “on” allosteric states of the GTP-bound form of H-Ras. Thirteen sites are revealed. expanding possible target sites for ligand binding well beyond the active site. Comparison of FTMaps for the H and K isoforms reveals essentially identical hot spots. Furthermore. using NMR measurements of spin relaxation. we determined that K-Ras exhibits global conformational dynamics very similar to those we previously reported for H-Ras.

Elastase is an enzyme for which these traditional assumptions. which underlie such structural and kinetic studies. do not hold. Three new crystal structures of elastase complexed to chemically similar inhibitors with similar binding affinities reveal a diversity of binding modes as well as two new subsites on elastase.

Twenty-five tight turns are studied in isolation. in the presence of the protein. and in the presence of the protein and crystal water molecules. The conformational properties are subdivided into those that are intrinsic to the turn and those that depend on the protein and water environment. Two factors are shown to determine the conformation of a tight β-turn. One is the twist of the β-sheet (responsible for selecting either a type I′ or II′ conformation as opposed to the more common types I or II) and the other is a local electrostatic effect (responsible for distinguishing between the type I′ and II′ conformations).

In spite of tremendous and sustained efforts. there are still no drugs in the clinic that directly target this major driver of human cancers. Recent success in the discovery of compounds that bind RAS and inhibit signaling has fueled renewed enthusiasm. and in-depth understanding of the structure and function of RAS has opened new avenues for direct targeting. To succeed. we must focus on the molecular details of the RAS structure and understand at a high-resolution level how the oncogenic mutants impair function.

This challenge would be facilitated by the availability of the structural network of signaling pathways.

The intersubunit linker also connects two active site loops that rearrange following cleavage and. in part. form the so-called loop bundle. As a result of chain cleavage. new hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts form among three active site loops. The new interactions are predicted to stabilize the active site. One unresolved issue is the extent to which the loop bundle residues also stabilize the procaspase active site. We examined the effects of replacing four loop bundle residues (E167. D169. E173. and Y203) on the biochemical and structural properties of the (pro)caspase.

Its mutants. present in about 30% of human cancers. are major drivers of oncogenesis and render tumors unresponsive to standard therapies. Here we report the engineering of a protein scaffold for preferential binding to K-Ras G12D.

We report the crystal structures of Ral-GppNHp and Ral-GDP. Disordered switch I and switch II. located away from crystal contacts. are observed in one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit of the Ral-GppNHp structure. In the other molecule in the asymmetric unit. a second Mg2+ ion is bound to the GppNHp γ-phosphate in an environment in which switch I is pulled away from the nucleotide and switch II is found in a tight β turn. Clustering of conserved residues on the surface of Ral-GppNHp identifies two putative sites for protein-protein interaction. One site is adjacent to switch I. The other is modulated by switch II and is obstructed in Ral-GDP. The Ral structures are discussed in the context of the published structures of the Ral/Sec5 complex.

Yet. the discovery of small molecules that can directly interfere with its function has been elusive in spite of intense efforts. This is most likely due to its highly flexible nature and the lack of a well-ordered active site. This chapter contains a discussion of our current understanding of conformational states in Ras-GTP. with focus on a recently discovered allosteric switch mechanism that may promote intrinsic hydrolysis of GTP in the presence of Raf.

All students need to appreciate and understand the broad conceptual areas of the discipline. the interdisciplinary nature of much current and future science. as well as the process of science in terms of both its approaches to problems and the cross disciplinary foundational concepts that can contribute to a clearer understanding of life processes. goals that align well with those of vision and change [1].

We have examined the equilibrium and kinetic folding of the CARD of Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor 1). which consists of 97 amino acid residues. at pH 6 and pH 8. The results showed that an apparent two state equilibrium mechanism is not adequate to describe the folding of Apaf-1 CARD at either pH. suggesting the presence of intermediates in equilibrium unfolding. Interestingly. the results showed that the secondary structure is less stable than the tertiary structure. based on the transition mid-points for unfolding. Single mixing and sequential mixing stopped-flow studies showed that Apaf-1 CARD folds and unfolds rapidly and suggest a folding mechanism that contains parallel channels with two unfolded conformations folding to the native …,True,KzmG7G8AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,12,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607002914,14579816851511928717,/scholar?cites=14579816851511928717,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2020445/,0,0,0

A realidade que analisamos reflete o imaginário coletivo que orienta as práticas pedagógicas de sala de aula. As análises produzidas se pautam pela abordagem etnográfica crítica de sala de aula. Apresentamos as seguintes características da sala de aula: 1) a geografia da disciplina dos corpos; 2) a assimetria de poder; 3) a unilateralidade do discurso; 4) a imposição curricular; 5) a hierarquia do saber; e 6) o escrutínio− substituição da punição física pela exposição física. São realizadas análises de imagens como representação da realidade buscando o entendimento do movimento interno e dialético de construção que engendram essas imagens. Desenhos e narrativas ilustram e representam o fracasso escolar e a exclusão educacional.

The technique is particularly suited to elucidate ambiguous catalytic steps in complex biochemical reactions. While NPC uniquely complements biochemical assays and X-ray structural analyses by revealing the protonation states of ionizable groups at and around the active site of enzymes. the technique suffers from a major drawback: large single crystals must be grown to compensate for the relatively low flux of neutron beams. However. in addition to revealing the positions of hydrogens involved in enzyme catalysis. NPC has the advantage over X-ray crystallography that the crystals do not suffer radiation damage. The lack of radiation damage can be exploited to conduct in crystallo parametric studies.

115567,Location of binding sites on proteins by the multiple solvent crystal structure method,2006,Dagmar Ringe and Carla Mattos,34,Fragment-based Approaches in Drug Discovery,,,John Wiley and Sons,One of the greater challenges of structural biology is to characterize proteins in enough detail so that the structures can be used for computational prediction of function. and for the design of compounds that can be used to modulate or to interfere with that function. In general. the function of a protein is associated with its interaction with other molecules. either small molecules or other large biological molecules. such as nucleic acids or proteins. Invariably. the function can be disrupted when that interaction is prevented. A complete industry exists solely for the purpose of finding such disruptors–they are called drugs. The discovery of drugs had been a serendipitous process. in an age when very little was known about the structures of the small molecules or their targets.

The experimental and calculated values for the difference between the free energy of denaturation of the mutant and the wild type are in reasonable agreement. However. the two approaches led to different explanations for the loss in stability. To analyze the differences. a series of refinements based on the crystallographic data were performed. a number of aspects of the simulations were reexamined. and continuum electrostatic calculations were done to complement the latter. The results of those comparisons provide a better understanding of the origin of the free energy difference in this mutant.

While Ras hydrolysis of GTP to GDP is intrinsically slow. we have discovered a GAP‐independent allosteric switch mechanism that results in ordering of switch II. placing the catalytic Q61 in the active site. This is expected to enhance the rate of hydrolysis through a mechanism where GTP acts as the general base. abstracting a proton from a nucleophilic water molecule. and shuttling it to a bridging water molecule that donates H‐bonds to Y32 in switch I and Q61 in switch II. This would promote a partial positive charge on the bridging water molecule. analogous to the arginine finger of GAP.

Although Ras is the archetypal GTPase. Rap1A is closely related with 50% sequence homology and similar tertiary structure; a key difference occurs at position 61. In Ras Q61 participates in the hydrolysis mechanism and mutation leads to oncogenesis. while T61 in Rap1A is not thought to be involved in catalysis. The goal of this project is to explore the Rap1A active site and method of intrinsic hydrolysis. Two crystal structures were obtained with differing conformations of T61 in the Rap1A active site.

Ras dimerization was first proposed thirty years ago. and it is known that Ras dimerization is essential for Raf activation. yet the mechanism through which this occurs has remained elusive. Attempts to detect Ras dimers on supported membranes have led to the conclusion that Ras does not dimerize in the absence of other factors. Here we show that the Ras binding domain of Raf (Raf‐RBD) is the key element prompting Ras dimerization. A small amount of Ras/Raf‐RBD dimer is seen in solution. while the addition of Raf‐RBD to Ras on supported lipid membranes produces robust levels of dimers. On the membrane. Ras/Raf‐RBD binding and Ras dimerization appear to be concerted events that lead to a high‐affinity signaling complex.

A wealth of evidence suggests that despite high sequence similarity of the Ras isoforms. H‐Ras. K‐Ras. and N‐Ras. there are distinct differences in signaling. localization. mutation position. and outcomes in cancer. Even in the absence of the C‐terminal hypervariable region (HVR). there are differences between the isoforms in the rates of GTP hydrolysis and in the details of Ras structure and dynamics. Here we present accelerated molecular dynamics simulations paired with solution x‐ray scattering that reveal differences in the conformational sampling of H‐Ras. K‐Ras4B. and N‐Ras. Specific interactions within water‐mediated allosteric networks are altered by the presence of isoform specific residues that impact accessibility to the catalytic state.

We present the 2.8 Å crystal structure of the HRas/CRaf-RBD_CRD complex showing the Ras/Raf interface as a continuous surface on Ras. In the Ras dimer. with helices roughly perpendicular to the membrane. the CRD is located between the two Ras protomers and far from the membrane. where its dynamic nature in the Ras binding pocket is expected to accommodate BRaf and CRaf heterodimers. Our structure and its analysis by MD simulations. combined with work in the literature. result in a molecular model in which Ras binding is involved in the release of Raf autoinhibition while the Ras/Raf complex dimerizes to promote a platform for signal amplification. with Raf-CRD poised to have direct and allosteric effects on both the Ras active site and the dimerization interface.,True,KzmG7G8AAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.225938v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/07/29/2020.07.28.225938.full.pdf,0,0,0

Solution scattering from a rigid protein can be predicted from atomic coordinate sets to within experimental error. However. structural fluctuations of proteins in solution can lead to significant changes in the observed intensities. The magnitude and form of these changes contain information about the nature and spatial extent of structural fluctuations in the protein. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on a crystal structure and selected force field generate models for protein internal motions. and here we demonstrate that they can be used to predict the impact of structural fluctuations on solution scattering data.

These dwarfs showed a 30‐fold reduction in levels of gibberellin A1 (GA1) and growth was partially restored by treatment with exogenous GA3. Qualitative and quantitative changes in carotenoids were also found.

Psyl. has recently been isolated as the clone GTOM5 [20] and shown by sequence identity to be the gene from which the major fruit-ripening cDNA clone TOM5 [19] was derived. Sequence analysis of transcripts from two allelic yellow-fruited tomato mutants. mapped to chromosome 3. has shown the lack of carotenoids in fruit of these mutants to be due to the production of aberrant TOM5 transcripts which are unlikely to encode a functional phytoene synthase enzyme. In one mutant (yellow flesh) the aberrant transcript contained a sequence that. by its strong hybridization to a wide size range of genomic fragments. appeared to be repeated many times within the genome.

The hypothesis that tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) ripening is controlled by the initial synthesis of the cell-wall-degrading enzyme polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15). which subsequently liberates cell-wall-bound enzymes responsible for the initiation of ethylene synthesis and other ripening events. has been examined.

115641,Yeast targets for mRNA methylation,2010,Zsuzsanna Bodi and James D Button and Donald Grierson and Rupert G Fray,38,Nucleic acids research,16,5327-5335,Oxford University Press, N 6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is a modified base present in the mRNA of all higher eukaryotes and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. where there is an increase in m6A levels during sporulation. The methyltransferase. Ime4. is responsible for this modification and has a role in the initiation of meiosis. However. neither the function. nor the extent of distribution of this nucleotide modification is established. We demonstrate that in S. cerevisiae. substantial levels of internal adenosine methylation are present in the GpA context in mRNA from sporulating cells. which is consistent with the preferred methylation consensus of higher eukaryotes.

Assessment of the purity of preparations involved phase-contrast and electron microscopy. assays for marker enzymes and RNA extraction and analysis. Proteins were extracted from isolated plastids at different ripening stages and separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The profiles obtained from chloroplasts and chromoplasts showed many qualitative and quantitative differences. Labelling of proteins with [35S]methionine in vivo showed that there was active protein synthesis throughout ripening. but there was a change in the plastid proteins made as ripening proceeded.

The steady state level of CAT mRNA in these plants was estimated to be less than 1% of the endogenous PG mRNA. Further constructs containing larger PG gene-flanking regions were generated and tested for their ability to direct higher levels of reporter gene expression. A 4.8 kb 5′-flanking region greatly increased levels of ripening-specific reporter gene activity. while a 1.8 kb 3′ region was only shown to have a positive regulatory role in the presence of the extended 5′ region. Transgenic plants containing the CAT gene flanked by both of these regions showed the same temporal pattern of accumulation of CAT and PG mRNA. and steady-state levels of the transgene mRNA were equivalent to 60 …,True,nlZ9wckAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,112,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00020391.pdf,5697542822642019058,/scholar?cites=5697542822642019058,,,0,0,0

Fray et al. (1994) Plant Mol Biol 24: 539–543]. It has been suggested that these proteins encode water channels or aquaporins. TRAMP mRNA accumulated in all tomato tissues tested and was elevated in fruit during post-anthesis development and again during ripening. Transgenic plants that constitutively expressed a TRAMP antisense RNA sequence were generated with a 94% reduction of endogenous TRAMP mRNA in fruit.

We tested two independent strategies to overcome ethylene-mediated growth inhibition when plants are grown in drying soil. Antisense suppression of plant ethylene synthesis was trialled to overcome the inhibition of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) leaf expansion. Rhizosphere bacteria containing the enzyme ACC deaminase (to decrease plant levels of the ethylene precursor ACC (1-aminocyclo-propane carboxylic acid)) were trialled to overcome the inhibition of pea (Pisum sativum L.) root growth. Two pea genotypes (cv. Sparkle and its E2 (sym5) mutant) were grown at two levels of soil moisture in pots containing the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Variovorax paradoxus 5C-2. The bacterium stimulated root biomass by 20-25% irrespective of soil moisture regime. and whole plant biomass was stimulated also by 25% in plants grown in drying soil. Isogenic wild-type (WT) and ACO1AS genotypes of tomato were grown at two different soil moisture regimes. The ACO1AS genotype has decreased ACC oxidase activity and is thus less able to convert ACC to ethylene. Leaves of WT and ACO1AS plants elongated at the same rate under well-watered conditions. When plants were exposed to drying soil. both genotypes dried the soil to a similar extent but ACO1AS leaves had a 10% higher growth rate than WT leaves. The significance of these responses to plant yield are under investigation.,True,nlZ9wckAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,79,http://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2004/poster/1/3/4/510_doddicref.pdf,8079819837233613353,/scholar?cites=8079819837233613353,,http://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2004/poster/1/3/4/510_doddicref.pdf,0,0,0

Studies of protein synthesis in vivo showed that application of 2 mol m−3 silver thiosulphate to mature green fruit prevented the appearance of several novel proteins associated with ripening. including the softening enzyme polygalacturonase. However. total protein synthesis. as judged by the incorporation of [35S] methionine into proteins. continued unabated after silver treatment. Ripening was also arrested when silver was supplied after ripening had begun. The accumulation of several ripening‐related mRNAs. including that for polygalacturonase. was studied by translation in vitro and using cDNA clones as hybridization probes.

This view has been criticized by Hotta and Stern 7. who demonstrated uptake of bacterial DNA by several plants but could not obtain any evidence for covalent binding of bacterial DNA to plant DNA except in abnormal conditions. such as those induced by desiccation or X-irradiation. In view of the general agreement that exogenous DNA can be taken up by plant cells and the lack of agreement concerning its fate within the cells it seems important to determine if such absorbed DNA can be expressed within plant cells.

Mature-green tomato fruits were found to contain about 30% of their ribosomal RNA in polyribosomes. At the 'breaker' or early ripening stage. about 50% of rRNA was in polyribosomes and this distribution of rRNA was maintained until fruits were fully ripe. The continued presence of polyribosomes is consistent with active protein synthesis persisting through and beyond the climacteric period when the wall-hydrolysing enzyme polygalacturonase accumulates and fruits soften. synthesize lycopene and undergo other ripening related changes.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1301,241-250,The Royal Society,Ripening of fleshy fruits involves major changes in physiology and biochemistry that alter their colour. flavour. texture. aroma and nutritional value. These changes affect all cell compartments and require the expression of new genes encoding enzymes that catalyse reactions essential for the development of quality attributes. In climacteric fruits. such as tomato. ethylene functions as a hormone to stimulate changes in gene expression required for ripening.

At about the same time there is a corresponding increase in the rate of cell division. The major part of the RNA consists of chloroplast and cytoplasmic rRNA. The accumulation of RNA proceeds more rapidly in the light but substantial amounts of both chloroplast and cytoplasmic rRNA are synthesised in the dark. Developing leaves also synthesise polydisperse RNA containing poly(adenylic) acid. The amount varies in leaves of different ages from 0.6 to 2.2^ of the total RNA.

It is a beneficial treatment. however. for the removal of astringency from persimmon to improve the fruit quality after harvest. High soluble tannins (SCTs) content is one of most important causes of astringency. High CO2 (95%) treatment effectively reduced SCTs in both “Mopan” and “Gongcheng-shuishi” persimmon fruit by causing increases in acetaldehyde. Using RNA-seq and realtime PCR. twelve ethylene response factor genes (DkERF11-22) were isolated and characterized. to determine those responsive to high CO2 treatment. Only two genes.

Moreover. DkERF19 and the previously isolated DkERF9 had additive effects on activating the DkPDC2 promoter.

Fruit were harvested at the breaker stage of maturity and ripened at 24 °C. or held at 4 °C for 6. 12 or 18 days before being transferred to 24 °C. When fruit were held at 24 °C without chilling. they accumulated lycopene and produced ethylene in a typical pattern. At 4 °C both lycopene accumulation and ethylene production were inhibited. With increasing periods at chilling temperatures. subsequent ripening at 24 °C. as indicated by lycopene accumulation. was reduced. Ethylene production at 24 °C was relatively unaffected by previous chilling temperatures. The patterns of accumulation of mRNAs homologous to the cDNA clones at both 4 °C and after transfer to 24 °C were variable. At 4 °C. expression of most mRNAs declined steadily to low …,True,nlZ9wckAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC,48,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176161711800568,14442565088629426784,/scholar?cites=14442565088629426784,,,0,0,0

Proteins that bind to those sites are key players in controlling mRNA stability. translation and localization. One family of regulatory proteins – the PUF proteins – are not only structurally related. but also bind to 3′UTRs and modulate mRNA expression in a wide variety of eukaryotic species. They do so either by enhancing turnover or repressing translation. and act combinatorially with other regulatory proteins.

We review our current understanding of the mechanisms of regulation. drawing particularly on examples in which the biological consequences of the regulation are clear. Specific mRNAs can be controlled via sequences in their 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and by alterations in the translation machinery. The 5′UTR sequence can determine which initiation pathway is used to bring the ribosome to the initiation codon. how efficiently initiation occurs. and which initiation site is selected. 5′UTR-mediated control can also be accomplished via sequence-specific mRNA-binding proteins. Sequences in the 3′ untranslated region and the poly(A) tail can have dramatic effects on initiation frequency. with particularly profound effects in oogenesis and early development.

We analyze the effects of single base changes in each position of AAUAAA and in the nucleotlde to which poly (A) is added on 3′ end formation in vitro. All 18 possible single base changes of the AAUAAA sequence greatly reduce addition of poly (A) to RNAs that end at the poly (A) addition site. and prevent cleavage of RNAs that extend beyond. The magnitude of reduction varies greatly with the position changed and the base introduced. For any given mutation. cleavage and polyadenylation are reduced to similar extents. strongly suggesting that the same factor interacts with AAUAAA in both reactions.

In eukaryotes. however. a primary transcript becomes an mRNA only after a collection of physical modifications: capping. cleavage to form a new 3'terminus. polyadenylation. splicing. base methylation. and the transport of mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm (1-3).

This article focuses on defining the sequences within a primary transcript that are necessary for three of these steps: cleavage. polyadenylation. and transport.Interest in these three steps stems first from their universality (1-3).

Hermaphrodites initially produce sperm but switch to producing oocytes. This switch appears to be controlled by the 3′ untranslated region of fem-3 messenger RNA.

The injection of amphibian oocytes was one of the first systems in which purified DNA was correctly transcribed and expressed as protein. An amphibian oocyte is a single large cell. surrounded by several thousand small follicle cells. It is in meiotic prophase. and active in RNA and protein synthesis. but totally inactive in DNA synthesis. The transcription of injected DNA takes place only in the nucleus or germinal vesicle of an oocyte. which is not normally visible. Gene isolation usually requires at least partially pure mRNA for the preparation of cDNA or for screening a genomic DNA library directly.

In the present work. we report that PUF proteins act directly on MAPK/ERK-encoding mRNAs to downregulate their expression in both the Caenorhabditis elegans germline and human embryonic stem cells. In C. elegans. FBF/PUF binds regulatory elements in the mpk-1 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) and coprecipitates with mpk-1 mRNA; moreover. mpk-1 expression increases dramatically in FBF mutants. In human embryonic stem cells. PUM2/PUF binds 3′UTR elements in both Erk2 and p38α mRNAs. and PUM2 represses reporter constructs carrying either Erk2 or p38α 3′ UTRs. Therefore. the PUF control of MAPK expression is conserved. Its biological function was explored in nematodes. where FBF promotes the self-renewal of germline stem cells. and MPK-1 promotes oocyte maturation and germ cell apoptosis. We found that FBF acts redundantly with LIP-1. the C. elegans homolog of MAPK phosphatase (MKP). to restrict MAPK activity and prevent apoptosis. In mammals. activated MAPK can promote apoptosis of cancer cells and restrict stem cell self-renewal. and MKP is upregulated in cancer cells.

It regulates multiple mRNAs critical for stem cell maintenance and germline development. Here. we report crystal structures of FBF in complex with 6 different 9-nt RNA sequences. including elements from 4 natural mRNAs. These structures reveal that FBF binds to conserved bases at positions 1–3 and 7–8. The key specificity determinant of FBF vs. other PUF proteins lies in positions 4–6. In FBF/RNA complexes. these bases stack directly with one another and turn away from the RNA-binding surface. A short region of FBF is sufficient to impart its unique specificity and lies directly opposite the flipped bases. We suggest that this region imposes a flattened curvature on the protein; hence. the requirement for the additional nucleotide.

We find that the addition of a full-length. 200-nucleotide poly(A) tail occurs in two discrete phases. In the first phase. the addition of each adenosine is dependent on the highly conserved sequence AAUAAA. Mutations in that sequence result in an accumulation of products that contain 9 or fewer adenosine residues. In the second phase. poly(A) addition no longer requires AAUAAA but. instead. requires the oligo(A) primer synthesized during the first phase. Thus. RNAs carrying an AAUAAA mutation and a 3'-terminal oligo(A) segment are extended efficiently to full-length poly(A). The transition between phases occurs with the addition of the tenth adenosine residue. An activity exists that limits the length of poly(A) added in the extract to approximately 200 nucleotides.

RNA containing that hairpin binds to coat protein that has been covalently bound to a solid support. Bound RNA-protein complexes can be eluted with excess R17 recognition sites. Using purified RNA. we demonstrate that binding to immobilized coat protein is highly specific and enables one to separate an RNA of interest from a large excess of other RNAs in a single step. Surprisingly. binding of an RNA containing non-R17 sequences to the support requires two recognition sites in tandem; a single site is insufficient.

In this assay system. a protein-RNA interaction is detected by the reconstitution of a transcriptional activator using two hybrid proteins and a hybrid RNA. The RNA molecule is tethered to the promoter of a reporter gene by binding to a hybrid protein consisting of the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein fused to the DNA-binding protein LexA; the RNA-binding domain to be analyzed is fused to the transcriptional activation domain of the yeast Gal4 protein; and the bifunctional RNA consists of binding sites for the coat protein and for the other RNA-binding domain.

Here we show that sequences downstream of the poly(A) site are required for cleavage of simian virus 40 (SV40) late pre-mRNAs in vitro in a crude nuclear extract from HeLa cells. The critical sequences are functionally redundant: extensive deletions or substitutions of downstream sequences prevent cleavage. but small substitutions do not.

Despite this conserved “two-handed” pattern of recognition. the RNA sequence is flexible. Among the binding sites of yeast Puf4p.

In this study. we confirmed an enrichment of Fabp7 mRNA and protein in the astrocytic perisynaptic compartment. and observed a diurnal change in the intracellular distribution of Fabp7 mRNA in molecular layers of hippocampus.

The Caenorhabditis elegans PUF proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2 (collectively FBF) regulate mRNAs in germ cells. Without FBF. adult germlines lose all stem cells. A major gap in our understanding of PUF proteins. including FBF. is a global view of their binding sites in their native context (i.e.. their “binding landscape”). To understand the interactions underlying FBF function. we used iCLIP (individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) to determine binding landscapes of C. elegans FBF-1 and FBF-2 in the germline tissue of intact animals. Multiple iCLIP peak-calling methods were compared to maximize identification of both established FBF binding sites and positive control target mRNAs in our iCLIP data.

To analyze the biology and molecular basis of this process. an adhesion-specific assay was developed: the phorbol ester-induced aggregation of human lymphocytes. This rapid and antigen-independent intercellular adhesion requires cellular metabolism. an intact cytoskeleton and extracellular divalent cations. and is mediated by preformed cell-surface proteins referred to as CAMs. Phorbol ester also induces aggregation of monocytes and granulocytes. as well as adhesion of T lymphocytes to either B cells or monocytes and of the leukocytes to vascular endothelial cells. By using the adhesion-specific assay and blocking monoclonal antibodies. several CAMs have been identified. namely the Leu-CAM family (CD11a-c/CD18) and ICAM-1 (CD54). The Leu-CAM family is composed of Leu-CAMa (CD11a/CD18). Leu-CAMb (CD11b/CD18) and Leu-CAMc (CD11c/CD18). three glycoprotein heterodimers made of a common beta-chain and distinct alpha-chains. ICAM-1 is an adhesive ligand for Leu-CAMa. Expression and use of the various CAMs is selective in different types of leukocytes. The Leu-CAMs have been purified and partially characterized. CD18. whose gene is on human chromosome 21. contains 5-6 N-linked complex-type oligosaccharides. and CD11 binds Ca++. Another adhesion pathway is mediated by CD2 and CD58.

This signal transduction event requires the presence of the TcR/CD3‐associated protein tyrosine kinase p59fyn. There is also evidence that the CD45 phosphotyrosine phosphatase is involved in TcR/CD3 signalling. We show here by capping experiments using double indirect immunofluorescence techniques that the receptor phosphotyrosine phosphatase CD45 and the intracellular protein tyrosine kinase p59fyn specifically co‐distribute in functional T lymphocytes. Furthermore. we provide evidence that isolated p59fyn is a substrate for CD45 as indicated by the rapid dephosphorylation of the regulatory Tyr531 of p59fyn by CD45.

Intercellular adhesion molecule-5 (ICAM-5; Telencephalin) is a neuronal adhesion molecule that regulates dendritic elongation and spine maturation. We find that ICAM-5 is cleaved from hippocampal neurons when the cells are treated with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA). The cleavage is blocked by MMP-2 and -9 inhibitors and small interfering RNAs. Newborn MMP-2– and MMP-9–deficient mice brains contain more full-length ICAM-5 than wild-type mice.

Their activity is largely regulated by a negative regulatory tyrosine which is a substrate for the activating action of the CD45 phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) or. conversely. the suppressing action of the cytosolic p50csk PTK. Here we report that CD45 was phosphorylated by p50csk on two tyrosine residues. one of them identified as Tyr-1193. This residue was not phosphorylated by T-cell PTKs p56lck and p59fyn. Tyr-1193 was phosphorylated in intact T cells. and phosphorylation increased upon treatment with PTPase inhibitors. indicating that this tyrosine is a target for a constitutively active PTK. Cotransfection of CD45 and csk into COS-1 cells caused tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 in the intact cells.

To date. studies have tended to focus on the immune functions of glial cells. whereas the roles of neurons have been regarded as passive and their immune-regulatory properties have been less examined.

Since the chemical concentration of ceramide penta- and tetrasaccharides in NIL cells was found nearly constant throughout various phases. the observed change of the label during the cell cycle can be ascribed to the alternation of the exposure rate of glycolipids due to altered organizational assemblage in surface membranes. In polyoma transformed NIL cells. the chemical quantity of higher glycolipids was reduced; nevertheless the rate of exposure was much greater than in NIL cells and was invariant during the cell cycle.

The leukocyte-specific integrins CD11a/CD18 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)) and CD11b/CD18 (complement type 3 receptor (Mac-1)). which bind to the intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and ICAM-2. play a key role in adhesion. Little is known about the binding in molecular detail. We have now defined a peptide region from the first immunoglobulin domain of ICAM-2 that is specifically involved in binding to CD11a/CD18. A synthetic peptide from this part of ICAM-2. covering residues 21-42. bound to purified CD11a/CD18 and inhibited the adhesion of endothelial cells to this integrin.

The short intracellular tails of integrins are devoid of catalytic activity. but are nevertheless important for adhesion and signaling. presumably. through interactions with cytoplasmic molecules. Recently. the structure of the intracellular tails has been investigated using NMR. giving important new insight into how integrins might be regulated. but many questions remain unanswered. Signaling by many cell-surface receptors involves protein phosphorylation; over the past few years. phosphorylation of the integrin tails at specific sites has started to emerge as a dynamic mechanism that regulates molecular interactions between integrins and cytoplasmic molecules. This phosphorylation might give rise to signaling specificity and fine-tuning of the integrin-mediated responses.,True,ADS6KhAAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,70,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000404001768,5453124922922264094,/scholar?cites=5453124922922264094,,,0,0,0

As the role of FAS in cancer cells remains largely unknown. we have initiated studies to assess the fate of newly synthesized lipids in cancer cells and have estimated the contribution of FAS to the synthesis of specific lipid classes by treating the cells with small interfering RNAs targeting FAS. Here. we show that in cancer cells FAS plays a major role in the synthesis of phospholipids partitioning into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains.

Some oxidation products are crucial to human health (primary bile acids and polyunsaturated FAs). whereas other substrates have to be degraded in order to avoid neuropathology at a later age (very long-chain FAs and xenobiotic phytanic acid and pristanic acid). Whereas total absence of peroxisomes is lethal. single peroxisomal protein deficiencies can present with a mild or severe phenotype and are more informative to understand the pathogenic factors. The currently known single protein deficiencies equal about one-fourth of the number of proteins involved in peroxisomal FA metabolism.

On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the first enzyme preparation displayed a single band of 41 kDa that was identified as 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase A (thiolase A) by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The second enzyme preparation consisted of a 58- and a 46-kDa band. The 58-kDa polypeptide reacted with antibodies raised against either sterol carrier protein 2 or the thiolase domain of sterol carrier protein 2/3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (SCP-2/thiolase). formerly also called sterol carrier protein X. whereas the 46-kDa polypeptide reacted only with the antibodies raised against the thiolase domain.

The levels of diacylglycerol. an activator of protein kinase C. as well as of alkylacylglycerol were elevated. A more drastic increase was observed in the ceramide levels after HIV-infection. whereas sphingosine levels were hardly influenced. Interestingly. the magnitude of the changes was related to the infection time. being higher at 8 days after infection then at 4 days. The possible role of these lipids in the cytopathic effects of HIV-infection is discussed.In addition. an improved methodology to quantitate simultaneously diacylglycerol and alkylacylglycerol in crude lipid extracts. based upon their phosphorylation by E. coli diacylglycerol kinase. is presented.,True,-pf-Sf8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,114,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X05814809,11185421064504776082,/scholar?cites=11185421064504776082,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51697804/s0006-291x_2805_2981480-920170208-24183-v4q7uu.pdf,0,0,0

115951,Redox interplay between mitochondria and peroxisomes,2015,Celien Lismont and Marcus Nordgren and Paul P Van Veldhoven and Marc Fransen,3,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,,35,Frontiers,Reduction-oxidation or ‘redox’ reactions are an integral part of a broad range of cellular processes such as gene expression. energy metabolism. protein import and folding. and autophagy. As many of these processes are intimately linked with cell fate decisions. transient or chronic changes in cellular redox equilibrium are likely to contribute to the initiation and progression of a plethora of human diseases. Since a long time. it is known that mitochondria are major players in redox regulation and signaling. More recently. it has become clear that also peroxisomes have the capacity to impact redox-linked physiological processes. To serve this function. peroxisomes cooperate with other organelles. including mitochondria. This review provides a comprehensive picture of what is currently known about the redox interplay between mitochondria and peroxisomes in mammals. We first outline the pro- and antioxidant systems of both organelles and how they may function as redox signaling nodes. Next. we critically review and discuss emerging evidence that peroxisomes and mitochondria share an intricate redox-sensitive relationship and cooperate in cell fate decisions. Key issues include possible physiological roles. messengers. and mechanisms. We also provide examples of how data mining of publicly-available datasets from ‘omics’ technologies can be a powerful means to gain additional insights into potential redox signaling pathways between peroxisomes and mitochondria. Finally. we highlight the need for more studies that seek to clarify the mechanisms of how mitochondria may act as dynamic receivers. integrators. and transmitters of …,True,-pf-Sf8AAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC,103,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2015.00035/full,98669097984696204,/scholar?cites=98669097984696204,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2015.00035/full,0,0,0

Here we demonstrate that in prostate cancer cells SQS expression is enhanced by androgens. channeling intermediates of the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway toward cholesterol synthesis.

These conclusions are based on the finding that incubation of lyase-deficient neurons with either sphingosine or S1P results in a similar elevation in cellular S1P; however. only S1P addition to the culture medium induces apoptosis.

However. with the exception of the peroxisome-targeting signal receptors and the receptor docking proteins. the function of most of these proteins. called peroxins. remains largely unknown. One step toward elucidating the function of a protein is to identify its interacting partners. We have used a non-transcription-based bacterial two-hybrid system to analyze the interactions among a set of 12 mammalian peroxins and a yeast protein three-hybrid system to investigate whether proteins that interact with the same peroxin and have overlapping binding sites cooperate or compete for this site. Here we report a detailed interaction map of these peroxins and demonstrate that (i) farnesylation. and not the CAAX motif. of Pex19p strongly enhances its affinity for Pex13p; (ii) the CAAXmotif. and not …,True,-pf-Sf8AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,77,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620343280,2992204640840374002,/scholar?cites=2992204640840374002,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620343280,0,0,0

Recently. studies have suggested that HDL cholesterol may inhibit and impaired cholesterol efflux may increase HSPC proliferation and differentiation.   Objectives We hypothesized that LDL may enhance HSPC proliferation and differentiation while HDL might have the opposing effect which might influence the size of the pool of inflammatory cells.   Methods and Results HSPC number and function were studied in hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout (LDLr−/−) mice on high fat diet. Hypercholesterolemia was associated with increased frequency of HSPC. monocytes and granulocytes in the peripheral blood (PB). In addition. an increased proportion of BM HSPC was in G2M of the cell cycle. and the percentage of HSPC and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) increased in BM of LDLr−/− mice. When BM Lin-Sca-1+cKit+ (i.e. “LSK”) cells were cultured in the presence of LDL in vitro we also found enhanced differentiation towards monocytes and granulocytes. Furthermore. LDL promoted lineage negative (Lin−) cells motility. The modulation by LDL on HSPC differentiation into granulocytes and motility was inhibited by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation. By contrast. when mice were infused with human apoA-I (the major apolipoprotein of HDL) or reconstituted HDL (rHDL). the frequency and proliferation of HSPC was reduced in BM in vivo. HDL also reversed the LDL-induced monocyte and granulocyte differentiation in vitro.

Acid sphingomyelinase knockout mice (ASMko) are a suitable model to address the role of sphingolipids in synaptic regulation as they recapitulate a mental retardation syndrome. Niemann Pick disease type A (NPA). and their neurons have altered levels of sphingomyelin (SM) and its derivatives. Electrophysiological recordings showed that ASMko hippocampi have increased paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation. Consistently. electron microscopy revealed reduced number of docked vesicles. Biochemical analysis of ASMko synaptic membranes unveiled higher amounts of SM and sphingosine (Se) and enhanced interaction of the docking molecules Munc18 and syntaxin1. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrated that Se changes syntaxin1 conformation enhancing its interaction with Munc18. Moreover. Se reduces vesicle docking in primary neurons and increases paired-pulse facilitation when added to wt hippocampal slices.

However. unlike traditional EAs. the DE-variants perturb the current-generation population members with the scaled differences of randomly selected and distinct population members. Therefore. no separate probability distribution has to be used for generating the offspring. Since its inception in 1995. DE has drawn the attention of many researchers all over the world resulting in a lot of variants of the basic algorithm with improved performance. This paper presents a detailed review of the basic concepts of DE and a survey of its major variants. its application to multiobjective. constrained. large scale. and uncertain optimization problems. and the theoretical studies conducted on DE so …,True,mjCLamoAAAAJ:l2sC-qQILUoC,4069,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5601760/,12163928916133906897,/scholar?cites=12163928916133906897,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Swagatam_Das/publication/220380793_Differential_Evolution_A_Survey_of_the_State-of-the-Art/links/00b7d52204106cb196000000/Differential-Evolution-A-Survey-of-the-State-of-the-Art.pdf,0,0,0

116007,Role of lipids and fatty acids in stress tolerance in cyanobacteria,2002,Suresh C Singh and Rajeshwar P Sinha and Donat-P Hader,41,,4,297-308,POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,Lipids are the most effective source of storage energy. function as insulators of delicate internal organs and hormones and play an important role as the structural constituents of most of the cellular membranes. They also have a vital role in tolerance to several physiological stressors in a variety of organisms including cyanobacteria. The mechanism of desiccation tolerance relies on phospholipid bilayers which are stabilized during water stress by sugars. especially by trehalose. Unsaturation of fatty acids also counteracts water or salt stress. Hydrogen atoms adjacent to olefinic bonds are susceptible to oxidative attack. Lipids are rich in these bonds and are a primary target for oxidative reactions. Lipid oxidation is problematic as enzymes do not control many oxidative chemical reactions and some of the products of the attack are highly reactive species that modify proteins and DNA. This review deals with the role of lipids and fatty acids in stress tolerance in cyanobacteria.,True,mjCLamoAAAAJ:JTtNqH-x4gYC,295,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1064.9867&rep=rep1&type=pdf,8400377729795910827,/scholar?cites=8400377729795910827,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1064.9867&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Surprisingly little is known about how membranes control the force from motors and how this may impact specific cellular functions. Here. we show that dynein motors physically cluster into microdomains on the membrane of a phagosome as it matures inside cells. Such geometrical reorganization allows many dyneins within a cluster to generate cooperative force on a single microtubule. This results in rapid directed transport of the phagosome toward microtubule minus ends. likely promoting phagolysosome fusion and pathogen degradation. We show that lipophosphoglycan. the major molecule implicated in immune evasion of Leishmania donovani. inhibits phagosome motion by disrupting the clustering and therefore the cooperative force generation of dynein.

While examining him in the emergency room. we were concerned about his respiratory status. and also that his right lung might be hypoplastic. With his diaphragmatic eventration occurring at the age of 3 years. 50 years of chronic compression of the right lung by the liver and bowels could theoretically retard the right lung development. However. this was not found intraoperatively. The right lung was able to be fully inflated. It was not clear what precipitated his acute respiratory failure.

Washington, DC",,,,"Since the debt crisis of the 1980s the international financial community has been providing help to debtor countries in reducing their external debt burdens in order to foster growth. reduce poverty. and attain external viability. This assistance has taken the form of the provision of concessional financing from international financial institutions. debt relief from official creditors mainly in the context of Paris Club reschedulings. and. in some cases. through bilateral action by the creditors. These measures have resulted in considerable success in alleviating the external debt burdens of many middle-income countries. Many poor countries. especially those in sub-Saharan Africa. however. continue to suffer from unacceptable levels of poverty and heavy external debt burdens owing to a combination of factors. including imprudent external debt-management policies. lack of perseverance in structural adjustment and economic reform. deterioration in their terms of trade. and poor governance. To address the problems of these countries. the World Bank and the IMF in September 1996 jointly launched the Initiative for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) with the aim of reducing the external debt burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a"" sustainable"" level in a reasonably short period of time. This pamphlet describes the rationale for and the main features of the Initiative as it was originally conceived in 1996 and its implementation through the fall of 1999.

Experimental work was conducted on EN-31 tool steel with copper. brass and graphite as tool electrodes with kerosene oil as dielectric fluid. The data compiled during experimentation has been used to yield responses in respect of material removal rate (MRR) and SR. Detailed analysis of structural features of machined surface was done by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and optical microscope to understand the mode of heat affected zone (HAZ). which alternatively affects structure of machined workpiece and hence tool life. While investigating electric discharge machining (EDM) surface by micrographs. it was observed that molten mass has been removed from surface as ligaments and sheets.

116030,Comparison of oral versus intravenous iron therapy in predialysis patients of chronic renal failure receiving recombinant human erythropoietin.,2003,HK Aggarwal and N Nand and Sunita Singh and M Singh and G Kaushik,51,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,,170-174,,OBJECTIVES: To compare oral versus intravenous iron in pre-dialysis patients of chronic renal failure (CRF) receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). METHODS: The study was undertaken in 40 adult patients of chronic renal failure. The patients were randomly divided into two groups A and B of 20 patients each. Group A patients were given oral iron and group B patients were given intravenous iron. All patients in both groups were given recombinant human erythropoietin 2000 IU twice weekly subcutaneously. The study was carried for up to three months. Patients were monitored every month for renal parameters and haematological parameters which included haemoglobin. reticulocyte count and packed cell volume. Ferrokinetic studies were done at baseline and at three months. RESULTS: It was observed that haematological parameters showed significant statistical improvement in the intravenous iron group as compared to group A (oral iron group). The ferrokinetic studies revealed that serum iron. serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. decreased significantly in oral iron group. whereas significant increase was seen in group B (intravenous iron group). None of the patients developed any adverse effects because of erythropoietin or iron therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant use of intravenous iron is better than oral iron in CRF patients treated with rHuEPO. The intravenous route of iron administration may be a preferred route along with rHuEPO therapy. more so in the Indian context where prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia is fairly high.,True,mjCLamoAAAAJ:pQthLKZIaNQC,66,https://europepmc.org/article/med/12725261,16954895447224444646,/scholar?cites=16954895447224444646,,,0,0,0

The large spatial coverage of the Indian plate by these sites and longer data duration helped us in refining the earlier estimates of the Euler pole for the Indian plate rotation. Our analysis suggests that the internal deformation of the Indian plate is very low (< 1–2 mm/year) and the entire plate interior region largely behaves as a rigid plate. Specifically. we did not infer any significant difference in motion on sites located north and south of the Narmada Son failed rift region. the most prominent tectonic feature within the Indian plate and a major source of earthquakes.

India,2004,VK Gahalaut and SK Singh,31,Geophysical research letters,11,,,Earthquakes in the Koyna‐Warna region of peninsular India are considered to be reservoir triggered. However. analyses of the available earthquake data indicate that the sustained high seismicity in this region may be influenced also by the geometry of the fault zones and their interactions through stress transfer. These distinct fault zones. inferred from the earthquake distribution and their focal mechanisms. are favourably oriented to each other in such a way that earthquake occurrences in one of the fault zones increase static stress on the other. facilitating frequent and continuing occurrence of earthquakes in the region. Here we show that though the effect of reservoir operations do promote slip on these faults. stress triggering appears to be an important cause for continuing high seismicity as it brings some of the stabilized faults closer to failure in the manner consistent with the inferred sense of motion.,True,mjCLamoAAAAJ:ddB7do2jUx8C,53,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2004GL019818,5103162107382359332,/scholar?cites=5103162107382359332,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2004GL019818,0,0,0

Western poplar is a model woody tree and a potential bioenergy feedstock. To investigate the extent of stress-regulated alternative splicing. we conducted an in-depth survey of leaf. root. and stem xylem transcriptomes under drought. salt. or temperature stress. Analysis of approximately one billion of genome-aligned RNA-Seq reads from tissue- or stress-specific libraries revealed over fifteen millions of novel splice junctions. Transcript models supported by both RNA-Seq and single molecule isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) data revealed a broad array of novel stress- and/or tissue-specific isoforms. Analysis of Iso-Seq data also resulted in the discovery of 15.087 novel transcribed regions of which 164 show alternate splicing. Our findings demonstrate that abiotic stresses profoundly perturb transcript isoform profiles and trigger widespread intron retention events. Stress treatments often increased or decreased retention of specific introns – a phenomenon described here as differential intron retention (DIR). Many differentially retained introns were regulated in a stress- and/or tissue-specific manner. A subset of transcripts harboring super stress-responsive DIR events showed persisting fluctuations in the degree of intron retention across all treatments and tissue types. To investigate coordinated dynamics of intron-containing transcripts in the study we quantified absolute copy number of isoforms of two conserved transcription factors using Droplet Digital PCR.

116057,Fused ring aromatic solvency in destabilizing water-in-asphaltene-heptane-toluene emulsions,1999,S Singh and JD McLean and PK Kilpatrick,20,Journal of dispersion science and technology,1-2,279-293,Taylor & Francis Group,The role of asphaltenes in stabilizing water-in-crude oil emulsions is extremely well established. The mechanism appears to be one in which planar. disk-like asphaltene molecules aggregate through lateral intermolecular forces to form primary aggregates or micelles which are interfacially active. These aggregates — upon adsorbing at the oil-water interface — crosslink through physical interactions to form a viscoelastic network. which has been characterized by some as a “skin” or a “plastic film”. The strength of this film. as gauged by shear and elastic moduli. seems to correlate well with water-in-oil emulsion stability. What is still relatively unknown is the role of chemistry in governing the strength of these lateral inter-asphaltene interactions. The candidate interactions include π-bonding between the delocalized electrons in the fused aromatic ring core. H-bonding between proton donors and acceptors imbedded …,True,mjCLamoAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C,43,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01932699908943792,8954253221312854343,/scholar?cites=8954253221312854343,,,0,0,0

Despite the favourable efficacy of this compound. the mode of action remains unknown. To gain information about the mode of action of CMNP. the effect of application to mature citrus fruit and Arabidopsis thaliana roots was explored. Peel contact was essential for mature fruit abscission in citrus. whereas root drenching was essential for symptom development and plant decline in Arabidopsis.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Astrocyte mitochondria play an important role for energy supply and neuronal survival in the brain. Toxic and degenerative processes are largely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We. therefore. investigated the effect of 3‐nitropropionic acid (NPA). a mitochondrial toxin and in vitro model of Huntington's disease (HD). on mitochondrial function and viability of primary striatal astrocytes. Although NPA is known as an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase. we observed an increase of astrocyte ATP levels after NPA treatment. This effect could be explained by NPA‐mediated alterations of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV isoform (COX IV) expression. The up‐regulation of COX isoform IV‐2 caused an increased enzyme activity at the expense of elevated mitochondrial peroxide production causing increased cell death.

The survey reveals a broadbased increase in such flows as a share of low-income country GDP across major regions. countries with differing commodity export composition. and countries with differing debt relief status. The increase in inflows is dominated by an increase in private sector inflows. mostly in the form of private transfers and foreign direct investment.

116074,Synergetic hydrothermal co-liquefaction of crude glycerol and aspen wood,2015,Thomas H Pedersen and Lukas Jasiūnas and Luca Casamassima and Shashank Singh and Thomas Jensen and Lasse A Rosendahl,106,Energy Conversion and Management,,886-891,Pergamon,Crude glycerol-assisted hydrothermal co-liquefaction of aspen wood was studied in batch micro-reactors. An experimental matrix of 14 experiments was defined to investigate the effects of three different process parameters on the yields of biocrude and char. and on biocrude quality. Co-processing aspen wood and neat glycerol led to a significant reduction in the char yield. and glycerol is hypothesized to act as a radical scavenger. alleviating re-polymerization of especially lignin-derived fragments. In the temperature range of 380–420° C. it was found that biocrude and char yield. and biocrude quality were all invariant to the reaction temperature. By increasing the crude glycerol to aspen wood mass ratio from 0: 1 to 3: 1. char yield was decreased from 18.3%(only aspen wood) to 3.4%. Furthermore. the biocrude quality in terms of the effective hydrogen-to-carbon ratio (H/C eff) was significantly affected by the crude …,True,mjCLamoAAAAJ:JTqpx9DYBaYC,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890415009395,11392996263167224672,/scholar?cites=11392996263167224672,,,0,0,0

Traditional signal processing (SP) methods are less effective due to noises and interferences from different sources and incipient faults which remain active for a short time with a particular frequency. In recent times. SP techniques along with artificial intelligence methods are being used for fault classification. Various complex approaches in SP domain have used for feature extraction of the vibration data to design a feature set. A challenging task is to select dominant features from the available feature set for improving the accuracy of fault classification. Thus. motivated by spectral kurtosis (SK) and extreme learning machine (ELM). we propose a novel intelligent diagnosis method for fault classification of rotating machines. In this paper.

In `Hamlin'. removal of up to 50% of the leaves in late November had no effect on fruit yield. fruit number. fruit size. soluble solids yield. juice °Brix. and °Brix to acid ratio of juice the following year. In `Valencia'. removal of 50% of the leaves in late March decreased fruit yield and soluble solids yield but did not affect Brix or the Brix to acid ratio of the juice.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Of all isolated neurotrophic molecules Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is the only one with a fully established physiological function. at least in the peripheral nervous system (see Thoenen and Edgar 1985; Thoenen et al. 1987b). This is largely due to the fact that it is present in very large quantities in exocrine glands (eg submandibular gland of the male mouse and accessory genital organs of various species). The physiological function of NGF in these exocrine glands is unknown. In any case it is irrelevant for the development and maintenance of specific properties of NGF responsive neurons (see Greene and Shooter 1980; Thoenen and Barde 1980; Thoenen et al. t985). These rich sources allowed the purification of NGF at an early stage of NGF research. This purification was an essential prerequisite for the production of anti-NGF antibodies (see Levi-Montalcini 1966; Levi-Montalcini and Angeletti 1968). the …,True,XA5D9uMAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,652,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0031026,8357164898300634580,/scholar?cites=8357164898300634580,,,0,0,0

Ltd,The protein brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been postulated to be a retrograde or paracrine synaptic messenger in long‐term potentiation and other forms of activity‐dependent synaptic plasticity. Although crucial for this concept. direct evidence for the activity‐dependent synaptic release of BDNF is lacking. Here we investigate secretion of BDNF labelled with green fluorescent protein (BDNF–GFP) by monitoring the changes in fluorescence intensity of dendritic BDNF–GFP vesicles at glutamatergic synaptic junctions of living hippocampal neurons. We show that high‐frequency activation of glutamatergic synapses triggers the release of BDNF–GFP from synaptically localized secretory granules. This release depends on activation of postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors and on postsynaptic Ca 2+ influx.

Transmembrane ephrinB ligands act as “receptor-like” signaling molecules. in part mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation and by engagement with PDZ domain proteins. However. the underlying cell biology and signaling mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that Src family kinases (SFKs) are positive regulators of ephrinB phosphorylation and phosphotyrosine-mediated reverse signaling. EphB receptor engagement of ephrinB causes rapid recruitment of SFKs to ephrinB expression domains and transient SFK activation. With delayed kinetics. ephrinB ligands recruit the cytoplasmic PDZ domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BL and are dephosphorylated.

A subsequent outermost layer of DNA on the calcium phosphate gave a colloidal stabilisation. The efficiency of such multi-shell particles was significantly higher than that of simple DNA-coated calcium phosphate nanoparticles.

116143,Regulation of the synthesis of nerve growth factor,1987,Rolf Heumann,132,,1,133-150,The Company of Biologists Ltd,Through nearly 40 years of research nerve growth factor (NGF) has become a paradigm for neurotrophic factors. NGF is synthesized and released from innervated target tissues in limiting amounts. thereby regulating the cell number and the differentiated properties of responsive neurones. Three distinct cell types are responsive to NGF: peripheral sensory and sympathetic neurones and certain types of central cholinergic ones. The effects of NGF are mediated through interaction with a specific receptor which activates a transmembrane second-messenger system. NGF synthesis is regulated during development and in the adult animal. In the developing whisker pad. NGF synthesis commences with its sensory innervation. but sensory neurones lack NGF receptors at the stage when their fibres are growing to their target. These findings indicate that NGF does not attract sensory nerve fibres chemotactically to their …,True,XA5D9uMAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,105,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/132/1/133.short,7223940490090186305,/scholar?cites=7223940490090186305,,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/132/1/133.full.pdf,0,0,0

116146,Exercise can rescue recognition memory impairment in a model with reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis,2010,Pauline Lafenêtre and Oliver Leske and Zhanlu Ma-Högemeie and Aiden Haghikia and Zoe Bichler and Petra Wahle and Rolf Heumann,3,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,,34,Frontiers,Running is a potent stimulator of cell proliferation in the adult dentate gyrus and these newly generated hippocampal neurons seem to be implicated in memory functions. Here we have used a mouse model expressing activated Ras under the direction of the neuronal Synapsin I promoter (named synRas mice). These mice develop down-regulated proliferation of adult hippocampal precursor cells and show decreased short-term recognition memory performances. Voluntary physical activity reversed the genetically blocked generation of hippocampal proliferating cells and enhanced the dendritic arborisation of the resulting doublecortin newly generated neurons. Moreover. running improved novelty recognition in both wild type and synRas littermates. compensating their memory deficits. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed to be a potential mediator of physical exercise acting in the hippocampus on dentate neurons and their precursors. This was confirmed here by the identification of doublecortin-immunoreactive cells expressing TrkB BDNF receptor. While no difference in BDNF levels were detected in basal conditions between the synRas mice and their wild type littermates. running was associated with enhanced BDNF expression levels. Thus increased BDNF signalling is a candidate mechanism to explain the observed effects of running. Our studies demonstrate that voluntary physical activity has a robust beneficial effect even in mice with genetically restricted neurogenesis and cognition.,True,XA5D9uMAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,96,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.08.034.2009/full,6026154720055265614,/scholar?cites=6026154720055265614,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.08.034.2009/full,0,0,0

This temporal correlation suggested that the arrival of sensory fibers might initiate NGF synthesis in their target tissues. Here we have eliminated the sensory and motor neurons projecting to the chick leg by the removal of the neural primordia in 3-day-old embryos.

E.-M.. Korsching. S.. and Thoenen. H. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99. 839-843). We have now determined the levels of mRNANGF in rat irides as a function of time in culture as well. After an initial lag period of 2 h. mRNANGF levels were transiently increased. so that after 12 h. they had increased 35-fold with respect to zero time. In contrast. poly(A)+ RNA levels dropped to 55% of the zero time values within 5 h. recovered to 85% after 24 h. and remained constant until the end of the observation period. Total ribosomal RNA was found to remain constant. indicating that there was no nonspecific decline of overall metabolic function.

Because of the well established potential of activated Ras to promote survival. we sought to investigate the ability of Rheb signaling to phenocopy Ras. We found that overexpression of lipid-anchored Rheb enhanced the apoptotic effects induced by UV light. TNFα. or tunicamycin in an mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent manner. Knocking down endogenous Rheb or applying rapamycin led to partial protection. identifying Rheb as a mediator of cell death.

116174,Corticosteroids reverse cytokine-induced block of survival and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from rats,2008,Stefan A Mann and Beatrix Versmold and Romy Marx and Sabine Stahlhofen and Irmgard D Dietzel and Rolf Heumann and Richard Berger,5,Journal of Neuroinflammation,1,1-17,BioMed Central,Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a frequent complication of preterm delivery. Proinflammatory cytokines. such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) released from astrocytes and microglia activated by infection or ischemia have previously been shown to impair survival and maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitors and could thus be considered as potential factors contributing to the generation of this disease. The first goal of the present study was to investigate whether exposure of oligodendrocyte precursors to these cytokines arrests the maturation of ion currents in parallel to its effects on myelin proteins and morphological maturation. Secondly. in the search for agents. that can protect differentiating oligodendrocyte precursor cells from cytokine-induced damage we investigated effects of coapplications of corticosteroids with proinflammatory cytokines on the subsequent survival and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. To exclude influences from factors released from other cell types purified cultures of oligodendrocyte precursors were exposed to cytokines and/or steroids and allowed to differentiate for further 6 days in culture. Changes in membrane surface were investigated with capacitance recordings and Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy. Na+- and K+- currents were investigated using whole cell patch clamp recordings. The expression of myelin specific proteins was investigated using western blots and the precursor cells were identified using immunostaining with A2B5 antibodies.

Some ATXN2 associates with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). inhibiting their endocytic internalization through interaction of proline-rich domains (PRD) in ATXN2 with SH3 motifs in Src. Gain of function of ATXN2 leads to neuronal atrophy in the diseases spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Conversely. ATXN2 knockout (KO) mice show hypertrophy and insulin resistance. To elucidate the influence of ATXN2 on trophic regulation. we surveyed interactions of ATXN2 with SH3 motifs from numerous proteins and observed a novel interaction with Grb2.

The concept of such retrograde trophic actions evolved from observations made by experimental embryologists at the beginning of this century. when they showed that the size of the field of innervation determines the extent of development of the corresponding spinal sensory and motor neurons of amphibia and chick embryos (Shorey 1909; Detwiler 1920; Hamburger 1934). More recently. similar observations were made concerning the peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. when it was demonstrated that the presence or absence of target organs determines the extent to which the innervating autonomic neurons survive or degenerate (Landmesser and Pilar 1974; Dibner and Black 1976; see also Varon and Bunge 1978).To analyze the mechanism of the trophic action of the …,True,XA5D9uMAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,44,http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/46/125.short,6687328787388159606,/scholar?cites=6687328787388159606,,,0,0,0

Autophagy has been shown to be protective at the early stages of programmed cell death but it can also promote apoptosis under certain conditions. Earlier we demonstrated that oxygen contributes to the pathogenesis of neonatal brain damage. which can be ameliorated by intervention with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo). Extrinsic-and intrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved in oxygen induced neurotoxicity but the role of autophagy in this model is unclear. We analyzed the expression of autophagy activity markers in the immature rodent brain after exposure to elevated oxygen concentrations. We observed a hyperoxia-exposure dependent regulation of autophagy-related gene (Atg) proteins Atg3. 5. 12. Beclin-1. microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). LC3A-II. and LC3B-II which are all key autophagy activity proteins. Interestingly. a single injection with rhEpo at the onset of hyperoxia counteracted these oxygen-mediated effects. Our results indicate that rhEpo generates its protective effect by modifying the key autophagy activity proteins.

Inc.,It has previously been shown that nerve growth factor (NGF) is of functional significance for mature pig oligodendrocytes (OLs) in culture. The present data give evidence for the expression of TrkA. the so‐called high‐affinity NGF receptor. and of p75NTR. the so‐called low‐affinity NGF receptor.

K‐252a inhibits the TrkA autophosphorylation. which reduces the OL process formation to control levels. To the tyrosine‐phosphorylated sites of TrkA several proteins. such as phospholipase C‐γ1. the adaptor protein SHC. the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SH‐PTP2 (SYP) associate via their SH2 phosphotase SH‐PTP2 domain.

At a Ca2+ concentration of 1.8mM the action potential is inhibited by tetrodotoxin. suggesting that the inward current is carried by Na+ ions. In contrast. at a Ca2+ concentration of 20–36mM and even in the absence of Na+. spikes (sometimes repetitive) with strong hyperpolarizing afterpotential occur. which are no longer affected by tetrodotoxin. They are. however. blocked by antagonists of Ca2+ like La3+. Co2+. Mn2+. and the synthetic compounds D-600 and BAY a-1040.

The domains differ by the insertion of five amino acid residues and their affinity to the tumour suppressor protein APC. Whereas PDZ2a is able to bind APC in the nanomolar range. PDZ2b shows no apparent interaction with APC. Here the solution structure of the splicing variant of PDZ2 with the insertion has been determined using 2D and 3D heteronuclear NMR experiments. The structural reason for the changed binding specificity is the reorientation of the loop with extra five amino acid residues. which folds back onto β-strands two and three. In addition the side-chain of Lys32 closes the binding site of the APC binding protein and the two helices. especially α-helix 2. change their relative position to the protein core.

The novel multi-PDZ domain protein FRMPD2 is a potential scaffolding protein consisting of an N-terminal KIND domain. a FERM domain and three PDZ domains. Here we show that FRMPD2 is localized in a polarized fashion in epithelial cells at the basolateral membrane and partially colocalizes with the tight-junction marker protein Zonula-occludens-1.

The intracellular membrane‐anchored GTPase Ras can be activated by a number of upstream mechanisms including binding of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor to its specific TrkB receptor. Ras activity plays an important morphogenetic role in neurons and therefore might also be involved in the asymmetric differentiation of tectal cells. To investigate the role of Ras. we determined the relative levels of activated Ras and of signalling active phospho‐TrkB in tecta of light‐ and dark‐incubated pigeons and combined this with an immunohistochemical detection of Ras‐GTP and TrkB receptors. While Ras activation levels did not differ between light‐ and dark‐incubated pigeons during embryonic development …,True,XA5D9uMAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,28,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2005.04410.x,12460303865315077923,/scholar?cites=12460303865315077923,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.406.6208&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

For quantitative analysis. commissural neurons of layers II/III were retrogradely labelled with dextran amine. In synRas mice. spine frequency on several orders of basal dendrites and apical oblique branches was significantly increased. Whereas density on basal dendrites was overall augmented. on apical dendrites. distal regions were most affected. The proportions of different morphological types of spines remained unchanged.

116192,Ras and rheb signaling in survival and cell death,2013,Anja Ehrkamp and Christian Herrmann and Raphael Stoll and Rolf Heumann,5,,2,639-661,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,One of the most obvious hallmarks of cancer is uncontrolled proliferation of cells partly due to independence of growth factor supply. A major component of mitogenic signaling is Ras. a small GTPase. It was the first identified human protooncogene and is known since more than three decades to promote cellular proliferation and growth. Ras was shown to support growth factor-independent survival during development and to protect from chemical or mechanical lesion-induced neuronal degeneration in postmitotic neurons. In contrast. for specific patho-physiological cases and cellular systems it has been shown that Ras may also promote cell death. Proteins from the Ras association family (Rassf. especially Rassf1 and Rassf5) are tumor suppressors that are activated by Ras-GTP. triggering apoptosis via eg. activation of mammalian sterile 20-like (MST1) kinase. In contrast to Ras. their expression is suppressed in many types of tumours. which makes Rassf proteins an exciting model for understanding the divergent effects of Ras activity. It seems likely that the outcome of Ras signaling depends on the balance between the activation of its various downstream effectors. thus determining cellular fate towards either proliferation or apoptosis. Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) is a protein from the Ras superfamily that is also known to promote proliferation. growth. and regeneration through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) pathway. However. recent evidences indicate that the Rheb-mTor pathway may switch its function from a pro-growth into a cell death pathway. depending on the cellular situation.

Altered function of CN may therefore be involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. We tested FK506 in a transgenic mouse model expressing mutated SOD1 for potential beneficial effects.

This time course may be influenced by release of a factor(s) from degenerating nerve terminals and/or by the lack of some factor(s) repressing NGF synthesis in vivo. We therefore analyzed the influence of biogenic amine transmitter substances and putative neuropeptides on this elevation of NGF synthesis in cultured iris. The marked increase of NGF synthesis seen initially in culture was not completely mimicked by any of the substances tested. A specific increase in NGF production up to 150 % of control was observed only with cGMP.

116238,Sites of feline coronavirus persistence in healthy cats,2010,Anja Kipar and Marina L Meli and Keith E Baptiste and Laurel J Bowker and Hans Lutz,91,Journal of General Virology,7,1698-1707,Microbiology Society,Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is transmitted via the faecal–oral route and primarily infects enterocytes. but subsequently spreads by monocyte-associated viraemia. In some infected cats. virulent virus mutants induce feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). a fatal systemic disease that can develop in association with viraemia. Persistently infected. healthy carriers are believed to be important in the epidemiology of FIP. as they represent a constant source of FCoV. shed either persistently or intermittently in faeces. So far. the sites of virus persistence have not been determined definitely. The purpose of this study was to examine virus distribution and viral load in organs and gut compartments of specified-pathogen-free cats. orally infected with non-virulent type I FCoV. over different time periods and with or without detectable viraemia.

In order to save this species. the Spanish authorities implemented a captive breeding program recruiting lynxes from the wild. In this context. a retrospective survey on prevalence of selected feline pathogens in free-ranging lynxes was initiated.  Methodology/ Principal Findings We systematically analyzed the prevalence and importance of seven viral. one protozoan (Cytauxzoon felis). and several bacterial (e.g.. hemotropic mycoplasma) infections in 77 of approximately 200 remaining free-ranging Iberian lynxes of the Doñana and Sierra Morena areas. in Southern Spain. between 2003 and 2007. With the exception of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). evidence of infection by all tested feline pathogens was found in Iberian lynxes. Fourteen lynxes were feline leukemia virus (FeLV) provirus-positive; eleven of these were antigenemic (FeLV p27 positive). All 14 animals tested negative for other viral infections. During a six-month period in 2007. six of the provirus-positive antigenemic lynxes died. Infection with FeLV but not with other infectious agents was associated with mortality (p<0.001). Sequencing of the FeLV surface glycoprotein gene revealed a common origin for ten of the eleven samples. The ten sequences were closely related to FeLV-A/61E. originally isolated from cats in the USA. Endogenous FeLV sequences were not detected.  Conclusions/Significance It was concluded that the FeLV infection most likely originated from domestic cats invading the lynx's habitats.

We have developed an one-tube quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay based on the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (TaqMan) to quantify the viral load of FIV-infected cats. Two different primer/probe systems were designed to detect a broad range of clade A FIV isolates. Both systems are characterized by excellent reproducibility. high sensitivity. and a wide range of quantification. As a consequence of this improved precision in the quantitative RT-PCR. preassay variations have greater impact on the accuracy of the viral load estimation. To compensate for these variations. we improved the assay and developed a multiplex real-time RT-PCR. which allows simultaneous calculation of the viral copy number and the individual recovery rate in an one-tube reaction. This enables the rapid and accurate calculation of copy number independent of preassay variations. In further studies. two additional real-time RT-PCR assays were designed and used to investigate the influence of sequence variations in the binding regions for either the primers or probe. Sequence mismatches in this region had a significant effect (up to 4 logarithmic decades) on reaction efficiency. In view of the inherent variability of retroviral sequences. these results underline the necessity to check reaction efficiencies before determining viral load.,True,7JMeUnQAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,88,https://europepmc.org/article/med/11176264,10468268201881103953,/scholar?cites=10468268201881103953,,,0,0,0

The largest fragment released from PMN by HNE was identical in size to CR1 shed spontaneously. The CR1 fragments cleaved from erythrocytes were functional. The shedding of sCR1 by activated PMN was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (80 ± 10 %). α1‐antiprotease (50 ± 5 %) and elafin (60 ± 5 %).

The ticks were examined for rickettsiae of the Ehrlichia phagocytophila group via nested PCR. Twenty-one ticks (1.3%) were positive; 3 (0.5%) were nymphs. 6 (1.3%) were adult males. and 12 (1.9%) were adult females. The number of positive ticks varied with the stage of development and with the geographical origin. Nucleotide sequencing of the isolated PCR products identified these products as part of the 16S rRNA gene of Ehrlichia. In addition. these products had 100% homology with the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. The occurrence of this agent in I. ricinus in Switzerland presents a potential danger of transmission of granulocytic ehrlichiosis to dogs. horses. and humans.,True,7JMeUnQAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,70,https://jcm.asm.org/content/37/5/1332.short,15220475744528975548,/scholar?cites=15220475744528975548,,https://jcm.asm.org/content/jcm/37/5/1332.full.pdf,0,0,0

We show here that binding of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase to DAP10 could not by itself trigger cell-mediated cytotoxicity and that binding of an intermediate consisting of the DAP10 binding partner Grb2 and the effector molecule Vav1 (Grb2-Vav1) to DAP10 was sufficient to initiate tyrosine-phosphorylation events. For full calcium release and cytotoxicity to occur. both Grb2-Vav1 and p85 had to bind to DAP10.

It is of particular interest that the tumor plasma cells appear to be restricted to the microenvironment of the BM and are rarely detected in the peripheral system. yet the disease is found widely disseminated throughout the axial skeleton. Furthermore. isolation of MM tumor cell lines has proven to be quite problematic due to their slow growth rate. These observations have instigated the search for earlier cells in the B cell lineage that are clonally related to the plasma cell tumor and that may represent the growth fraction of the tumor.

However. the mechanisms by which sensitive targets activate killing have been difficult to study due to the lack of a prototypic NK cell triggering receptor. Pharmacologic evidence has implicated protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in natural killing; however. Lck-deficient. Fyn-deficient. and ZAP-70–deficient mice do not exhibit defects in natural killing despite demonstrable defects in T cell function. This discrepancy implies the involvement of other tyrosine kinases. Here. using combined biochemical. pharmacologic. and genetic approaches. we demonstrate a central role for the PTK Syk in natural cytotoxicity.

The diagnosis of cirrhosis portends an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of cirrhosis and staging of fibrosis. However. despite its universal use. liver biopsy is an invasive and inaccurate gold standard with numerous drawbacks. In order to overcome the limitations of liver biopsy. a number of non-invasive techniques have been investigated for the assessment of cirrhosis. This review will focus on currently available non-invasive markers of cirrhosis. The evidence behind the use of these markers will be highlighted. along with an assessment of diagnostic accuracy and performance characteristics of each test.

Vav-2 function requires the N-terminus. as well as functional Dbl homology and SH2 domains. Moreover. the enhancement of NFAT-dependent transcription by Vav-2 can be inhibited by a number of dominant-negative GTPases. The ability of Vav-2 to potentiate NFAT-dependent transcription correlates with its ability to promote a sustained calcium flux. Thus.

LAT is tyrosine phosphorylated upon stimulation of NK cells through FcγRIII receptors and following direct contact with NK-sensitive target cells. This NK stimulation induces the association of LAT with several phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. In addition to the biochemical evidence showing LAT involvement in NK cell activation. a genetic model shows that LAT is required for FcR-dependent phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ.

We investigated Asef2. an Asef1 homologue having a similar N-terminal APC binding region (ABR) and Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain. Contrary to previous reports. we found that Asef1 and Asef2 exchange activity is Cdc42 specific. Moreover. the ABR of Asef2 did not function independently but acted in tandem with the SH3 domain to bind APC. The ABRSH3 also bound the C-terminal tail of Asef2. allowing it to function as an autoinhibitory module within the protein. Deletion of the C-terminal tail did not constitutively activate Asef2 as predicted; rather. a conserved C-terminal segment was required for augmented Cdc42 GDP/GTP exchange. Thus.

Here we demonstrate an unexpected mechanism of Dyn2 action in these contexts via direct binding to the Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vav1. Surprisingly. disruption of the Dyn2-Vav1 interaction targets Vav1 to the lysosome for degradation via an interaction with the cytoplasmic chaperone Hsc70. resulting in a dramatic reduction of Vav1 protein stability. Importantly. a specific mutation in Vav1 near its Dyn2-binding C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain prevents Hsc70 binding. resulting in a stabilization of Vav1 levels. Dyn2 binding regulates the interaction of Vav1 with Hsc70 to control the stability and subsequent activity of this oncogenic GEF.

Here we show that Parkin interacts with anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) coactivators Cdc20 and Cdh1 to mediate the degradation of several key mitotic regulators independent of APC/C. We demonstrate that ordered progression through mitosis is orchestrated by two distinct E3 ligases through the shared use of Cdc20 and Cdh1. Furthermore. Parkin is phosphorylated and activated by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) during mitosis.

Using pancreatic cancer as a model. we find that constitutively active Ras signaling increases GSK-3β gene expression via the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.

The Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) has been implicated in generation of TCR signals and immune synapse formation. however. it is currently not known if Vav's GEF activity is required in T cell activation by the TCR in general. and in actin polymerization downstream of the TCR in particular.

Vav1 functions in TCR signaling and Ca++ mobilization via a mechanism that does not appear to strictly depend on the intrinsic GEF activity.  Conclusions/Significance We propose here a model in which Vav functions primarily as a tyrosine phosphorylated linker-protein for TCR activation of T cells.

These include (1) fine‐root proliferation and implications for whole‐plant water uptake; (2) enhanced water‐use efficiency and consequences for drought tolerance; (3) reductions in stomatal conductance and impacts on leaf water potential; and (4) solute accumulation. osmotic adjustment and …,True,qLSYcUEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,404,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2002.00796.x,14223985528331492221,/scholar?cites=14223985528331492221,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2002.00796.x,0,0,0

However. the resistance to accessibility of sugars embedded in plant cell walls (so-called recalcitrance) is a major barrier to economically viable cellulosic ethanol production. A recent report from the US National Academy of Sciences indicated that. “absent technological breakthroughs”. it was unlikely that the US would meet the congressionally mandated renewable fuel standard of 35 billion gallons of ethanol-equivalent biofuels plus 1 billion gallons of biodiesel by 2022. We here describe the properties of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) biomass that has been genetically engineered to increase the cellulosic ethanol yield by more than 2-fold. We have increased the cellulosic ethanol yield from switchgrass by 2.6-fold through overexpression of the transcription factor PvMYB4. This strategy reduces carbon deposition into lignin and phenolic fermentation inhibitors while maintaining the availability of potentially fermentable soluble sugars and pectic polysaccharides. Detailed biomass characterization analyses revealed that the levels and nature of phenolic acids embedded in the cell-wall. the lignin content and polymer size. lignin internal linkage levels. linkages between lignin and xylans/pectins. and levels of wall-bound fucose are all altered in PvMYB4-OX lines. Genetically engineered PvMYB4-OX switchgrass therefore provides a novel system for further understanding cell wall recalcitrance.

Z. mobilis performs best under anaerobic conditions. but is an aerotolerant organism. However. the genetic and physiological basis of ZM4's response to various stresses is understood poorly. In this study. transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles for ZM4 aerobic and anaerobic fermentations were elucidated by microarray analysis and by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. In the absence of oxygen. ZM4 consumed glucose more rapidly. had a higher growth rate. and ethanol was the major end-product.

HPLC and GC analyses revealed minor differences in extracellular metabolite profiles at the corresponding early exponential phase time point. Differences in extracellular metabolite profiles between conditions became greater as the fermentations progressed.

Although it imports and ferments both pentose and hexose sugars to produce a mixture of ethanol. acetate. lactate. H2 and CO2. the proportion of ethanol is low. which impedes its use in consolidated bioprocessing for biofuels production. Therefore genetic engineering will likely be required to improve the ethanol yield. Plasmid transformation. random mutagenesis and heterologous expression systems have previously been developed for C. cellulolyticum. but targeted mutagenesis has not been reported for this organism. hindering genetic engineering. The first targeted gene inactivation system was developed for C. cellulolyticum. based on a mobile group II intron originating from the Lactococcus lactis L1.LtrB intron. This markerless mutagenesis system was used to disrupt both the paralogous L-lactate dehydrogenase (Ccel_2485; ldh) and L-malate dehydrogenase (Ccel_0137; mdh) genes. distinguishing the overlapping substrate specificities of these enzymes. Both mutations were then combined in a single strain. resulting in a substantial shift in fermentation toward ethanol production. This double mutant produced 8.5-times more ethanol than wild-type cells growing on crystalline cellulose. Ethanol constituted 93% of the major fermentation products. corresponding to a molar ratio of ethanol to organic acids of 15. versus 0.18 in wild-type cells. During growth on acid-pretreated switchgrass. the double mutant also produced four times as much ethanol as wild-type cells.

However. C. thermocellum is relatively sensitive to ethanol compared to ethanologenic microorganisms such as yeast and Zymomonas mobilis that are used in industrial fermentations but do not possess native enzymes for industrial cellulose hydrolysis. In this study. C. thermocellum was grown to mid-exponential phase and then treated with ethanol to a final concentration of 3.9 g/L to investigate its physiological and regulatory responses to ethanol stress. Samples were taken pre-shock and 2. 12. 30. 60. 120. and 240 min post-shock. and from untreated control fermentations for systems biology analyses. Cell growth was arrested by ethanol supplementation with intracellular accumulation of carbon sources such as cellobiose. and sugar phosphates. including fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. The largest response of C. thermocellum to ethanol shock treatment was in genes and proteins related to nitrogen uptake and metabolism. which is likely important for redirecting the cells physiology to overcome inhibition and allow growth to resume.

Gemini is a 1α.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 analog with two identical side chains that. despite its significantly increased volume. binds to the VDR and can function as a potent agonist. This study demonstrates that. at excess corepressor (CoR) levels. Gemini shifts from an agonist to an inverse agonist that actively recruits CoR proteins to the VDR and mediates superrepression. Under these conditions Gemini stabilizes the VDR into a silent conformation. in which helix 12 of the ligand-binding domain is repositioned and thus unable to contribute to coactivator interaction.

Golden. CO (United States); Oak Ridge National Lab.(ORNL). Oak Ridge. TN (United States). BioEnergy Science Center (BESC),Here. in an effort to better understand the biomass recalcitrance. six natural poplar variants were selected as feedstocks based on previous sugar release analysis. Compositional analysis and physicochemical characterizations of these poplars were performed and the correlations between these physicochemical properties and enzymatic hydrolysis yield were investigated. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and 13 C solid state NMR were used to determine the degree of polymerization (DP) and crystallinity index (CrI) of cellulose. and the results along with the sugar release study indicated that cellulose DP likely played a more important role in enzymatic hydrolysis. Simons’ stain revealed that the accessible surface area of substrate significantly varied among these variants from 17.3 to 33.2 mg g  as reflected by dye adsorption. and cellulose accessibility was shown as one of the major factors governing substrates digestibility.

Previous studies indicated that several stress-related proteins and changes in the ZM4 membrane lipid composition may contribute to ethanol tolerance. However. the molecular mechanisms of its ethanol stress response have not been elucidated fully.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. ethanol stress responses were investigated using systems biology approaches. Medium supplementation with an initial 47 g/L (6% v/v) ethanol reduced Z. mobilis ZM4 glucose consumption. growth rate and ethanol productivity compared to that of untreated controls. A proteomic analysis of early exponential growth identified about one thousand proteins. or approximately 55% of the predicted ZM4 proteome. Proteins related to metabolism and stress response such as chaperones and key regulators were more abundant in the early ethanol stress condition. Transcriptomic studies indicated that the response of ZM4 to ethanol is dynamic. complex and involves many genes from all the different functional categories. Most down-regulated genes were related to translation and ribosome biogenesis. while the ethanol-upregulated genes were mostly related to cellular processes and metabolism. Transcriptomic data were used to update Z. mobilis ZM4 operon models. Furthermore. correlations among the transcriptomic. proteomic and metabolic data were examined. Among significantly expressed genes or proteins. we observe higher correlation coefficients when fold-change values are higher.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of initial pH on a batch mixed culture fermentation of glycerol. considering both the bacterial community composition and the fermentation patterns. For pH values between 5 and 9. 1.3-PDO production yields ranged from 0.52 ± 0.01 to 0.64 ± 0.00                                                                                                                                                                           . with the highest values obtained at pH 7 and 8. An Enterobacteriaceae member closely related to Citrobacter freundii was strongly enriched at all pH values. Within the less dominant bacterial species. two different microbial community structures were found. one at acid pH values and another at neutral to basic pH values. 1.3-PDO production was improved at pH values over 7. It was anti-correlated with lactate and ethanol production but positively correlated with acetate production. No direct correlation between 1.3-PDO production and a specific family of bacteria was found. suggesting functional redundancies in the microbial community.

After 8 weeks. all had 6 to 10 coppice shoots. All shoots. except the tallest (dominant) shoot. were removed from five of the trees (pruned treatment). and shoot growth. gas exchange and carbohydrate status were compared in the pruned and unpruned trees.

Cellulolytic microbes are often robust biomass hydrolyzers and may offer cost advantages; however. it is unknown whether their activity can also be significantly influenced by the ratio of different monolignol types in Populus biomass. Hydrolysis and fermentation of autoclaved. but otherwise not pretreated Populus trichocarpa by Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 was compared using feedstocks that had similar carbohydrate and total lignin contents but differed in S/G ratios.                             Populus with an S/G ratio of 2.1 was converted more rapidly and to a greater extent compared to similar biomass that had a ratio of 1.2. For either microbes or commercial enzymes. an approximate 50 % relative difference in total solids solubilization was measured for both biomasses. which suggests that the differences and limitations in the microbial breakdown of lignocellulose may be largely from the enzymatic hydrolytic process. Surprisingly. the reduction in glucan content per gram solid in the residual microbially processed biomass was similar (17–18 %) irrespective of S/G ratio. pointing to a similar mechanism of solubilization that proceeded at different rates. Fermentation metabolome testing did not reveal the release of known biomass-derived alcohol and aldehyde inhibitors that could explain observed differences in microbial hydrolytic activity.

The Populus root microbiome is a diverse community that has high abundance of β- and γ-Proteobacteria. both classes which include multiple plant-growth promoting representatives. To understand the contribution of individual microbiome members in a community. we studied the function of a simplified community consisting of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia bacterial strains isolated from Populus hosts and inoculated on axenic Populus cutting in controlled laboratory conditions. Both strains increased lateral root formation and root hair production in Arabidopsis plate assays and are predicted to encode for different functions related to growth and plant growth promotion in Populus hosts. Inoculation individually. with either bacterial isolate. increased root growth relative to uninoculated controls. and while root area was increased in mixed inoculation. the interaction term was insignificant indicating additive effects of root phenotype. Complementary data including photosynthetic efficiency. whole-transcriptome gene expression and GC-MS metabolite expression data in individual and mixed inoculated treatments indicate that the effects of these bacterial strains are unique and additive.

AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN 1 (ALD1) is needed for the accumulation of the plant defense signal salicylic acid (SA) during the first hours after infection with the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and is also upregulated by infection and SA. ALD1 is an aminotransferase with multiple substrates and products in vitro. Pipecolic acid (Pip) is an ALD1-dependent bioactive product induced by P. syringae. Here. we addressed roles of ALD1 in mediating defense amplification as well as the levels and responses of basal defense machinery.

Low-molecular weight metabolites produced within plant tissues. such as salicylic acid. represent one such mechanism which likely mediates plant – microbe interactions above and below ground. Salicylic acid is a ubiquitous phytohormone at low levels in most plants. yet are concentrated defense compounds in Populus. likely acting as a selective filter for rhizosphere microbiomes. We propagated twelve Populus trichocarpa genotypes which varied an order of magnitude in salicylic acid (SA)-related secondary metabolites. in contrasting soils from two different origins. After four months of growth. plant properties (leaf growth. chlorophyll content. and net photosynthetic rate) and plant root metabolomics specifically targeting SA metabolites were measured via GC-MS. In addition. rhizosphere microbiome composition was measured via Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S and ITS2 rRNA-genes. Soil origin was the primary filter causing divergence in bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities with plant genotype secondarily influential. Both bacterial/archaeal and fungal evenness varied between soil origins and bacterial/archaeal diversity and evenness correlated with at least one SA metabolite (diversity: populin; evenness: total phenolics).

The anaerobic. thermophilic. cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum is a candidate microorganism for such conversions but it. like many bacteria. is sensitive to potential toxic inhibitors developed in the liquid hydrolysate produced during biomass processing. Microbial processes leading to tolerance of these inhibitory compounds found in the pretreated biomass hydrolysate are likely complex and involve multiple genes.   Methodology/Principal FindingsIn this study. we developed a 17.5% v/v Populus hydrolysate tolerant mutant strain of C. thermocellum by directed evolution. The genome of the wild type strain. six intermediate population samples and seven single colony isolates were sequenced to elucidate the mechanism of tolerance. Analysis of the 224 putative mutations revealed 73 high confidence mutations. A longitudinal analysis of the intermediate population samples. a pan-genomic analysis of the isolates. and a hotspot analysis revealed 24 core genes common to all seven isolates and 8 hotspots. Genetic mutations were matched with the observed phenotype through comparison of RNA expression levels during fermentation by the wild type strain and mutant isolate 6 in various concentrations of Populus hydrolysate (0%. 10%. and 17.5% v/v).

By accepted definition. NPP is the difference between carbon gain from autotrophic organisms (i.e.. gross primary production. GPP) minus autotrophic respiration (R auto). NEP is the annual net change in ecosystem carbon storage defined as NPP minus heterotrophic respiration (R hetero). At the local scale.

Although much of the work-to-date has centered on characterizing this microbe’s growth on model cellulosic substrates. such as cellobiose. Avicel. or filter paper. it is vitally important to understand its metabolism on more complex. lignocellulosic substrates to identify relevant industrial bottlenecks that could undermine efficient biofuel production. To this end. we have examined a time course progression of C. thermocellum grown on switchgrass to assess the metabolic and protein changes that occur during the conversion of plant biomass to ethanol. The most striking feature of the metabolome was the observed accumulation of long-chain. branched fatty acids over time. implying an adaptive restructuring of C. thermocellum’s cellular membrane as the culture progresses. This is undoubtedly a response to the gradual accumulation of lignocellulose-derived inhibitory compounds as the organism deconstructs the switchgrass to access the embedded cellulose. Corroborating the metabolomics data. proteomic analysis revealed a corresponding time-dependent increase in various enzymes. including those involved in the interconversion of branched amino acids valine. leucine. and isoleucine to iso- and anteiso-fatty acid precursors. Additionally. the metabolic accumulation of hemicellulose-derived sugars and sugar alcohols concomitant with increased abundance of enzymes involved in C5 sugar metabolism/pentose phosphate pathway indicates that C. thermocellum shifts glycolytic intermediates to alternate pathways to modulate overall carbon …,True,qLSYcUEAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC,25,https://biotechnologyforbiofuels.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13068-016-0697-5,18060983761829350873,/scholar?cites=18060983761829350873,,https://biotechnologyforbiofuels.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13068-016-0697-5,0,0,0

The isolated granules are structurally intact as revealed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. When Ca2+ is present. the isolated granules instantaneously discharge their contents. The site of action of Ca2+ may reside in the membrane of the granule. Procaine. a competitive inhibitor of Ca2+ binding to membranes. completely blocks the discharge of cortical granules that normally occurs at fertilization.

Studies of the cortex. beginning at the turn of the century. played a major role in the establishment of the field of experimental embryology (Wilson. 1925).

This timing corresponds to the breakdown of the cortical granules. The evidence presented shows that the protease prevents polyspermy through its action on the vitelline layer. The protease ‘hardens’ the layer and makes it incapable of binding sperm. Sperm that are bound to the vitelline layer before cortical granule breakdown lose their attachment to the layer as the protease is excreted.

In free-spawning animals with no complex mating behavior. prezygotic reproductive isolation (speciation) could result from the rapid divergence of genes coding for sperm and egg proteins that bind each other during fertilization.

Several mathematical simulations predict that both male and female reproductive proteins should evolve rapidly by positive selection.

A hole about 3 μm in diameter then forms in the VL in the area of the discharging acrosome. Ultrastructural observations show the hole to be filled with attenuated VL fibers. The sperm then swims through the hole and interacts with the egg plasma membrane. The soluble contents of abalone acrosomes can be obtained by induction of the acrosome reaction in high-calcium seawater. Two major proteins of subunit molecular weights 13.000 (13K) and 15.000 (15K) are found in the supernatant after removal of the reacted sperm by centrifugation.

116537,Methods for quantitating sea urchin sperm-egg binding,1973,VD Vacquier and Judith E Payne,82,Experimental cell research,1,227-235,Academic Press,Two simple photometric methods are described for determining the average number of bound sea urchin spermatozoa per egg between 0 and 60 sec after insemination. One method is based on stopping gamete interaction with formaldehyde and then. after the eggs settle with sperm bound to their surfaces. measuring the turbidity of sperm remaining in suspension. An alternative method involves removal of the dead. unbound sperm from the formaldehyde fixed eggs by repeated washing in sea water. The bound sperm are then released from the egg surface by pronase digestion and the turbidity of the sperm suspension measured and related to sperm concentration by direct cell counts. Two phases of gamete interaction exist (1) the binding phase. from 0 to 20 or 25 sec. during which time sperm continuously bind to the egg surfaces; (2) the unbinding phase. from 20 or 25 to 50 sec. during which time the sperm …,True,kwJk-2UAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C,134,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014482773902656,9797772538847045869,/scholar?cites=9797772538847045869,,,0,0,0

Many steps in fertilization involve carbohydrate-based molecular recognition between sperm and egg. Although there is conservation of gamete recognition molecules within vertebrates. their homologues have not yet been discovered in echinoderms and ascidians (the invertebrate deuterostomes). In echinoderms. long sulfated polysaccharides act as ligands for sperm receptors. Ascidians employ egg coat glycosides that are recognized by sperm surface glycosidases.

Much has been learned about how sea urchin sperm locate and fertilize the egg. Sperm and eggs are spawned simultaneously into the surrounding seawater. Sperm signaling pathways lead to downstream events that ensure fertilization. Upon spawning. sperm must acquire motility and then they must swim towards or respond to the egg in some way. Finally. they must undergo a terminal exocytotic event known as the acrosome reaction that allows the sperm to bind to the vitelline layer of the egg and then to fuse with the egg plasma membrane. Motility is stimulated by exposure to seawater. while later events are orchestrated by factors from the egg.

This review describes the molecular evolution of fertilization proteins in sea urchins. abalone. and oysters. animals with external fertilization that broadcast their gametes into seawater. Theories regarding the selective forces responsible for the rapid evolution driven by positive selection seen in many fertilization proteins are discussed. This strong selection acting on divergence of interacting fertilization proteins might lead to prezygotic reproductive isolation and be a significant factor in the speciation process. Since only a fraction of all eggs are fertilized and only an infinitesimal fraction of male gametes succeed in fertilizing an egg. gametes are obviously a category of entities …Since only a fraction of all eggs are fertilized and only an infinitesimal fraction of male gametes succeed in fertilizing an egg. gametes are obviously a category of entities …,True,kwJk-2UAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C,98,https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/3/11/a002931.short,12234751632917540850,/scholar?cites=12234751632917540850,,https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/3/11/a002931.full.pdf,0,0,0

The 652-aa suNCKX shares structural topology with other NCKX proteins. and has two protein kinase A sites and a His-rich region in its cytoplasmic loop. The suNCKX is encoded by a single gene. which is highly expressed in testes. The suNCKX activity of whole sperm shows Na+ and K+ dependence. and like other NCKXs can run in reverse exchange mode.

The average position of the palaeomagnetic poles from the three seamounts in the Pacific Basin is at 56 N-66 W. which agrees in latitude with the average pole position of 51 N-14 W obtained previously from another group of four seamounts in the Pacific Basin off Hokkaido. A group of three seamounts west of the Izu-Bonin Arc (Shikoku Basin) gave an average pole position of 76 N-44 W. The difference in latitude between the pole positions of the groups within and outside the Pacific Basin can be interpreted as caused by a northerly drift of the Pacific Ocean floor.

Within minutes after coelomic fluid is removed from the body cavity. a massive cell–cell adhesion of coelomocytes occurs. This event is referred to as clotting. Clotting is thought to be a defense mechanism against loss of coelomic fluid if the body wall is punctured. and it may also function in the cellular encapsulation of foreign material and microbes. Here we show that this intercoelomocyte adhesion is mediated by amassin. a coelomic plasma protein with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 75 kD. Amassin forms large disulfide-bonded aggregates that adhere coelomocytes to each other. One half of the amassin protein comprises an olfactomedin (OLF) domain.

Of interest are processes that create reproductive protein diversity within species. because intraspecific variants are potentially involved in mate choice and early speciation. Sperm acrosomes of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas contain the protein bindin that bonds sperm to egg during fertilization. Oyster bindin is a single-copy gene encoding a diversity of protein variants. Oyster bindins have a conserved N-terminal region followed by one to five tandem fucose-binding lectin (F-lectin) domains.

To create the hole. lysin binds tightly to VERL (the VE receptor for lysin). a giant. unbranched glycoprotein comprising 30% of the VE. Binding of lysin to VERL causes the VERL molecules to lose cohesion and splay apart creating the hole. Lysin and VERL represent a cognate pair of gamete recognition proteins. one male the other female. which mediate fertilization. The coevolution of such cognate pairs may underlie the establishment of species-specific fertilization which could be a component of the mechanism to achieve reproductive isolation and hence new species.

116571,Geomagnetism in marine geology,1972,Victor Vacquier,,,,,Elsevier,In the past decade magnetic surveys of the oceans. combined with results from other branches of geophysics and geology have provided data for the construction of a plausible scheme for the evolution of the present distribution of land and oceans on the earth. According to this scheme. the surface of the globe is divided into roughly ten major rigid plates presently moving with respect to each other in response to unknown forces deep in the earth. Plates may consist of both continental and oceanic parts. their present boundaries being outlined by earthquakes.Where two plates move away from each other new crust is formed at the rate of 1 to 12 cm/year. while when they move toward each other crust is being consumed often by underthrusting of a cold plate thus causing deep and shallow earthquakes. The most conspicuous spreading occurs in the ocean floor at the crest of oceanic ridges like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where only shallow earthquakes occur because hot rock is close to the surface. As it cools. the new crust becomes magnetized in the direction of the magnetic field. When the field reverses its direction the rock is magnetized in the opposite way. Thus strips of positively and negatively magnetized rock form symmetrical bands on either side of the spreading ridges. which cause identical sequences of magnetic anomalies in widely different parts of the world. These properties of symmetry about the ridge axis and world-wide identity of the sequence of magnetic anomalies parallel to oceanic ridges establish beyond the shadow of a doubt that during the last 80 million years (my) at least. the geomagnetic field can be regarded as due to a …,True,kwJk-2UAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC,73,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=D0d9m9rlyr4C&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:y4LOjHUpkJkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=u3CgK4BQ93&sig=GYxHpugnV7KfCuS7wfJX_HnqPoE,11065389869299565259,/scholar?cites=11065389869299565259,,,0,0,0

The uptake and interiorization of DS were examined with a tritiated product over the course of 4 d in culture. The exposure of macrophages to 20 micrograms/ml of 3H-DS led to linear uptake for 4 d. at which time fusion was inhibited. Macrophage interiorization of 3H-DS was greatly increased by forming insoluble complexes with either serum lipoproteins or purified human low density lipoproteins (LDL). Under these conditions fusion was inhibited within 4 h. The uptake of large quantities of acetylated LDL in the absence of DS was not associated with the inhibition of fusion. Lipoproteins therefore served as the DS carriers and were not themselves inhibitory.

These two proteins form part of a complex which is thought to mediate the fusion of plasma and vesicle membranes during exocytosis. This paper reports the identification of syntaxin and VAMP homologues in sea urchin sperm. During fertilization. sea urchin sperm release the contents of a single vesicle. the acrosomal vesicle. exposing the membrane destined to fuse with the egg.

A Wiley Company,A method was devised for isolating the insoluble content of the acrosome granule of sperm of the oyster Crassostrea gigas. The method involves the dissolution of the entire cell. except for the acrosome granule. in the detergent sodium lauroyl sarcosinate (sarcosy I). The isolated acrosome granule content is ring‐shaped and is 84% protein by weight. SDS‐polyacrylamide gel electro‐phoresis of this material yields from 1 to 4 bands of 65.000; 53.000; 43.000 and 34.000 apparent molecular weight. all of which stain with the PAS reaction indicating the material is a glycoprotein. The 65.000 molecular weight component is always present. but the presence of the other three bands varies with each preparation. The isolated acrosome granules agglutinate formaldehyde‐fixed oyster eggs. A trypsin‐generated glycopeptide digest of oyster egg surfaces inhibits the agglutinin activity of the isolated acrosome granules.

Arbacia is the only genus that contains species found in both high and low latitudes. In order to determine the geographical origin of the genus and its history of speciation events. we constructed phylogenies based on cytochrome oxidase I and sperm bindin from all its species. Both the mitochondrial and the nuclear gene genealogies show that Arbacia originated in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere and gave rise to three species in the eastern Pacific. which were then isolated from the Atlantic by the Isthmus of Panama. The mid‐Atlantic barrier separated two additional species. The bindin data suggest that selection against hybridization is not important in the evolution of this molecule in this genus.

Haliotis). Following cloning and sequencing of one repeat unit from one species. the consensus sequences of this satellite were determined for five species by directly sequencing genomic DNA using satellite-specific primers. Phylogenetic trees of the consensus satellite sequences had the same topology as trees constructed for two abalone sperm acrosomal proteins. In 12 randomly picked clones of the Red abalone (H. rufescens) SalI satellite. 16 positions varied. the variation being spread throughout the sequence. GenBank database searches found no significant similarities between this satellite and known sequences. Southern analysis showed that all 290-bp SalI repeats were excised from genomic DNA by Sau3A1 digestion. The tandem arrangement of satellite repeats was confirmed by sequencing through the SalI site into the next repeat using genomic DNA as template. time-dependent appearance of DNA ladders with an approximate 300-bp spacing in SalI digests of genomic DNA. and ladders of bands with an approximate 300-bp spacing generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic DNA as template. In the Red abalone. the 290-bp SalI satellite represents approximately 0.5% of total DNA. equivalent to approximately 28.000 copies per haploid genome.

Blockage of the acrosome reaction by WGA was bypassed by a combination of the ionophores A23187 and monensin. although neither ionophore was effective individually.

These cells were recently shown to contain an ortholog of the mammalian soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Here. we show that sAC is present in the sperm head and as in mammals is stimulated by bicarbonate. The acrosome reaction (AR). a process essential for fertilization. is influenced by the bicarbonate concentration in seawater. By using functional assays and immunofluorescence techniques we document that sea urchin sperm also express orthologs of multiple isoforms of transmembrane ACs (tmACs). Our findings employing selective inhibitors for each class of AC indicate that both sAC and tmACs participate in the sperm acrosome reaction.,True,kwJk-2UAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC,45,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X07010339,2381332002180839503,/scholar?cites=2381332002180839503,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3644950/,0,0,0

A Wiley Company,Four decades have passed since the first discovery of collagen IV by Kefalides in 1966. Since then collagen IV has been investigated extensively by a large number of research laboratories around the world. Advances in molecular genetics have resulted in identification of six evolutionary related mammalian genes encoding six different polypeptide chains of collagen IV. The genes are differentially expressed during the embryonic development. providing different tissues with specific collagen IV networks each having unique biochemical properties. Newly translated α‐chains interact and assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum in a chain‐specific fashion and form unique heterotrimers. Unlike most collagens. type IV collagen is an exclusive member of the basement membranes and through a complex inter‐ and intramolecular interactions form supramolecular networks that influence cell adhesion. migration. and …,True,u6sN0KIAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,598,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jemt.20564,4161515911927258278,/scholar?cites=4161515911927258278,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4788096/,0,0,0

We recently described a facile procedure for isolation of proteins rich in Amadori adducts but free of AGEs. thus permitting study of pathways of conversion of Amadori compounds to AGEs.

The anomalous persistence of these fetal isoforms of type IV collagen in the GBM in XAS also confers an unexpected increase in susceptibility to proteolytic attack by collagenases and cathepsins.

The GBM is composed of five (α1 to α5) of the six chains of type IV collagen. organized into an α1·α2(IV) and an α3·α4·α5(IV) network. In Alport syndrome. mutations in any of the genes encoding the α3(IV). α4(IV). and α5(IV) chains cause the absence of the α3·α4·α5 network. which leads to progressive renal failure. In the present study. the molecular mechanism underlying the network defect was explored by further characterization of the chain organization and elucidation of the discriminatory interactions that govern network assembly. The existence of the two networks was further established by analysis of the hexameric complex of the noncollagenous (NC1) domains. and the α5 chain was shown to be linked to the α3 and α4 chains by interaction through …,True,u6sN0KIAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C,233,https://www.jbc.org/content/275/39/30716.short,14628718788962726920,/scholar?cites=14628718788962726920,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818444237,0,0,0

It is a critical transient intermediate in catalysis of transamination reactions by vitamin B6‐dependent enzymes. The discovery eight years ago that PM can inhibit the Maillard reaction stimulated new interest in this B6 vitamer as a prospective pharmacological agent for treatment of complications of diabetes. PM application in diabetic nephropathy has now progressed to a phase III clinical trial. Investigation of the PM mechanism of action demonstrated that PM inhibits post‐Amadori steps of the Maillard reaction by sequestering catalytic metal ions and blocking oxidative degradation of Amadori intermediate. PM also has the capacity to scavenge toxic carbonyl products of sugar and lipid degradation. and to inhibit reactive oxygen species.

These changes are extremely complex and occur very slowly. We demonstrate here that hemoglobin and myoglobin are extremely susceptible to damage by glucose in vitro through a process that leads to complete destruction of the essential heme group. This process appears in addition to the expected formation of so-called advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on lysine and other side-chains. AGE formation is enhanced by the iron released. In contrast. the heme group is not destroyed during glycation of cytochrome c. where the sixth coordination position of the heme iron is not accessible to solvent ligands.

Hydra. is a simplified metazoan whose body wall is composed of an epithelial bilayer with an intervening extracellular matrix termed the mesoglea. Hydra messoglea has been shown to have a number of components seen in higher invertebrate and vertebrate matrices. including fibronectin. type IV collagen. laminin. and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Based on previous studies which indicated that extracellular matrix components are critical to hydra development. the current study was designed to determine the role of intact fibronectin and its various functional domains during development of hydra cell aggregates. Hydra cell aggregation involves the complete morphogenesis of adult hydra from pellets of dissociated hydra cells. During this development process. cells segregate into an epithelial bilayer and then deposit a new extracellular matrix prior to continuation of morphogenesis.

Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disease causing rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. The clinical manifestations are caused by autoantibodies that bind to a constituent. termed the Goodpasture autoantigen. of alveolar and glomerular basement membranes. Searches for the identity of this constituent have recently culminated in the discovery of two new chains (α3 and α4) of type IV collagen and the identification of the α3 chain as the Goodpasture autoantigen. The gene. COL4A3. encoding this autoantigen was recently cloned and localized to the q35-37 region of chromosome 2. The major protomeric form of the α3 chain is a homotrimer.

The therapeutic effect of PM has been demonstrated in multiple animal models of diabetes and in phase II clinical trials. However. the mechanism of PM therapeutic action is poorly understood. One potential mechanism is scavenging of pathogenic reactive carbonyl species (RCS) found to be elevated in diabetes. We have suggested previously that the pathogenicity of RCS methylglyoxal (MGO) may be due to modification of critical arginine residues in matrix proteins and interference with renal cell−matrix interactions. We have also shown that this MGO effect can be inhibited by PM (Pedchenko et al. (2005) Diabetes 54. 2952−2960).

A major ECM component are members of the collagen superfamily –comprising 28 types in vertebrates – that exist in diverse supramolecular assemblies ranging from networks to fibrils. Each assembly is characterized by a hallmark feature. a protein structure called a triple helix. A current gap in knowledge is understanding the mechanisms of how the triple helix encodes and utilizes information in building scaffolds on the outside of cells.

116704,Mechanism of chain selection in the assembly of collagen IV: a prominent role for the α2 chain,2006,Jamshid Khoshnoodi and Kristmundur Sigmundsson and Jean-Philippe Cartailler and Olga Bondar and Munirathinam Sundaramoorthy and Billy G Hudson,281,Journal of Biological Chemistry,9,6058-6069,Elsevier,Collagens comprise a large superfamily of extracellular matrix proteins that play diverse roles in tissue function. The mechanism by which newly synthesized collagen chains recognize each other and assemble into specific triple-helical molecules is a fundamental question that remains unanswered. Emerging evidence suggests a role for the non-collagenous domain (NC1) located at the C-terminal end of each chain. In this study. we have investigated the molecular mechanism underlying chain selection in the assembly of collagen IV. Using surface plasmon resonance. we have determined the kinetics of interaction and assembly of the α1(IV) and α2(IV) NC1 domains.

Hydrogen peroxide reacts with iron to form the extremely reactive and damaging hydroxyl radical via the Fenton reaction. Superoxide anion accelerates this reaction because the dismutation of superoxide leads to increased levels of hydrogen peroxide and because superoxide elevates the intracellular concentration of iron by attacking iron-sulfur proteins.

116718,Solution redox chemistry of carbon nanotubes,2004,Ming Zheng and Bruce A Diner,126,Journal of the American Chemical Society,47,15490-15494,American Chemical Society,UV/vis/NIR absorbance spectra were used to monitor electron transfer between small-molecule redox reagents and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The oxidation of (6. 5)-enriched nanotubes in water with K2Ir(Cl)6 reveals a valence electron density of 0.2−0.4 e-/100 carbon atoms and a reduction potential of ∼800 mV versus NHE. The reduction potential of CNTs is found to increase with increasing band gap and to decrease with the introduction of an anionic dispersant. In light of this newly revealed redox chemistry of CNTs. we propose that the previously observed bleaching of the CNT absorbance spectrum at low pH is most likely a consequence of the oxidation of the nanotubes by oxygen. These results demonstrate facile oxidation and reduction of CNTs. provide a way to quantify the population of valence electrons. and point to possible applications of CNT in the catalysis of redox reactions. ,True,P2hGlRMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,347,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0457967,9321405590630879407,/scholar?cites=9321405590630879407,,,0,0,0

116719,Redox sensing by prokaryotic transcription factors,2000,Ming Zheng and Gisela Storz,59,,1,1-6,Elsevier,Prokaryotic cells employ redox-sensing transcription factors to detect elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and regulate expression of antioxidant genes. In Escherichia coli. two such transcription factors. OxyR and SoxR. have been well characterized. The OxyR protein contains a thiol–disulfide redox switch to sense hydrogen peroxide. The SoxR protein uses a 2Fe–2S cluster to sense superoxide generated by redox-cycling agents. as well as to sense nitric oxide. Both proteins are turned on and off with very fast kinetics (∼ minutes). allowing rapid cellular responses to oxidative stress. The mechanisms by which these and other prokaryotic proteins sense redox signals have provided useful paradigms for understanding redox signal transduction in eukaryotic cells.,True,P2hGlRMAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC,317,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295299002890,3717923801763357104,/scholar?cites=3717923801763357104,,,0,0,0

A type of silica-based column resin was identified that shows minimum adsorption of DNA-CNT. Three such columns in series with pore sizes of 2000. 1000. and 300 Å were found to separate DNA-CNT into fractions of very narrow length distribution. as measured directly by atomic force microscopy. The average length decreases monotonically from >500 nm in the early fractions to <100 nm in the late fractions. with length variation ≤10% in each of the measured fractions. Using UV−vis−NIR spectroscopy. we showed that SEC is very effective in removing graphitic impurities that contribute to the spectral baseline and a broad absorption peak at ∼270 nm.

Here. we study distribution of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in two immiscible aqueous phases formed by the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran. This well-defined model system exhibits a strikingly robust phenomenon: CNTs spontaneously partition between the PEG- and the dextran-rich phases according to nanotube’s diameter and metallicity. Thermodynamic analysis suggests that this chirality-dependent partition is determined by nanotube’s intrinsic hydrophobicity and reveals two distinct regimes in hydrophobicity-chirality relation: a small diameter (<1 nm) regime. where curvature effect makes larger diameter tubes more hydrophobic than small diameter ones. and …,True,P2hGlRMAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC,263,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja402762e,14756536807816062076,/scholar?cites=14756536807816062076,,http://pstorage-acs-6854636.s3.amazonaws.com/4058524/ja402762e_si_001.pdf,0,0,0

The essential step of the process is to deposit a dilute solution of DNA-wrapped carbon nanotubes (DNA-CNTs) on a SiO2 surface covered with a thin hydrophobic layer. This leads to deposition of fully aligned CNTs. The alignment pattern can be controlled by metal electrodes in the deposition region and can be quantitatively modeled by the behavior of a quasi-two-dimensional DNA-CNT nematic phase near the solution/SiO2 interface.

Using a polyethylene glycol (PEG)/dextran (DX) aqueous two-phase system. we show that electron-transfer between redox molecules and SWCNTs triggers reorganization of the surfactant coating layer. leading to strong modulation of nanotube partition in the two phases. While the DX phase is thermodynamically more favored by an oxidized SWCNT mixture. the mildly reducing PEG phase is able to recover SWCNTs from oxidation and extract them successively from the DX phase. Remarkably. the extraction order follows SWCNT bandgap: semiconducting nanotubes of larger bandgap first. followed by semiconducting nanotubes of smaller bandgap. then nonarmchair metallic tubes of small but nonvanishing bandgap. and finally armchair metallic nanotubes of zero …,True,P2hGlRMAAAAJ:1Ye0OR6EYb4C,76,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl504189p,10485650047311894795,/scholar?cites=10485650047311894795,,https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.usc.edu/dist/6/111/files/2018/03/94730-1vye48l.pdf,0,0,0

Chromatography has been reported to separate small SWNTs (diameter ≤0.9 nm) according to their diameter. chirality. and length. The separation efficiency decreased with increasing tube diameter when the ssDNA sequence d(GT)n (n = 10−45) was used.

Yet the use of length-defined SWCNTs is limited. in part due to the lack of an easily accessible materials preparation method.

We show that the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a crowding agent into DNA-wrapped SWCNT dispersion leads to the formation of reversible. nematic. and rodlike microclusters. which can be collected by gentle centrifugation. Since shorter SWCNTs form clusters at higher polyethylene glycol concentration. gradual increase in PEG concentration results in length fractionated SWCNTs.

This approximation is related to the Franck–Condon principle. which in its simplest form holds that electronic transitions are instantaneous on the time scale of nuclear motion. The Condon approximation leads to a long-held assumption in Raman spectroscopy of carbon nanotubes: intensities arising from resonance with incident and scattered photons are equal. Direct testing of this assumption has not been possible due to the lack of homogeneous populations of specific carbon nanotube chiralities.

Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) has been developed as a reliable method for high-resolution length fractionation of DNA-dispersed SWCNTs but has not been applied to surfactant-dispersed SWCNTs due to their lower dispersion stability and tendency to adsorb onto SEC stationary phases.

Current methods cannot monitor endolysosomal lipid content in vivo. hindering preclinical drug development and research into the mechanisms linking endolysosomal lipid accumulation to disease progression. We developed a single-walled carbon nanotube–based optical reporter that noninvasively measures endolysosomal lipid accumulation via bandgap modulation of its intrinsic near-infrared emission.

Existing methods for single-chirality SWCNT purification are cumbersome. often requiring multiple steps and different conditions for different species. Here. we report a method to achieve total fractionation of a synthetic SWCNT mixture by countercurrent chromatography. resulting in purification of many single-chirality SWCNT species in a single run. This method is based on a tunable partition of sodium deoxycholate dispersed SWCNTs in a polyethylene glycol/dextran aqueous two-phase system.

B 77. 125405 (2008)] to probe quantum interference in the resonance Raman response from carbon nanotube samples highly enriched in the single semiconducting chiralities of (8. 6).(9. 4). and (10. 5). UV Raman excitation profiles of G-band spectra reveal unambiguous signatures of interference between the third and fourth excitonic states (E 33 and E 44). Both constructive and destructive responses are observed and lead to anomalous intensity ratios in the LO and TO modes. Especially large anomalies for the (10. 5) structure result from nearly identical energies found for the two E i i transitions. The interference patterns demonstrate that the sign of the exciton-phonon coupling matrix elements changes for the LO mode between the two electronic states. and remains the same for the TO mode.

The current method of synthesizing these hybrids via direct sonication of DNA/nanotube mixtures is time-consuming and not suitable for high-throughput synthesis and combinatorial sequence screening.

Here we report quantitative measurements and analysis of the interactions between DNA-CNT hybrids at low salts. Condensation of DNA-CNT hybrids by neutral osmolytes leads to liquid crystalline phases. and varying the osmotic pressure modulates the interhybrid distance that is determined by x-ray diffraction. Thus obtained force-distance dependencies of DNA-CNT hybrids show a remarkable resemblance to that of double-stranded DNA with differences that can be largely accounted for by their different diameters. This establishes their common physical nature of electrostatically driven interactions. Quantitative modeling further reveals the roles of hydration in mediating the interhybrid forces within the last nanometer of surface separation.

The commonly used optical absorption-based concentration measurement is complicated by the spectral change due to variations in nanotube chirality and length. In particular. the origin of the observed length-dependent spectral change and its effect on concentration determination has been the subject of considerable debate. Here. we use length-fractionated DNA-wrapped SWCNTs to establish the relationship between SWCNT carbon concentration and optical absorption spectra by directly quantifying the amount of wrapping DNA and. independently. the DNA/carbon nanotube mass ratio.

A simplified. rate zonal ultracentrifugation (RZU) process is first applied to obtain samples of highly-enriched DWCNTs from a raw carbon nanotube material that has both single- and double-wall carbon nanotubes. Using this purified DWCNT suspension. we demonstrate for the first time that DWCNTs can be further processed using aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) for sequential separation by electronic structure and diameter. Additionally. we introduce analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) as a new method for DWCNT characterization to assess DWCNT purity in separated samples. Results from AUC analysis are utilized to compare two DWCNT separation schemes.

Defects in human complex I result in energy generation disorders and are also implicated in Parkinson9s disease and altered apoptotic signaling. The assembly of this complex is poorly understood and is complicated by its large size and its regulation by two genomes. with seven subunits encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the remainder encoded by nuclear genes. Here we analyzed the assembly of a number of mtDNA- and nuclear-gene-encoded subunits into complex I. We found that mtDNA-encoded subunits first assemble into intermediate complexes and require significant chase times for their integration into the holoenzyme.

116828,Mitochondrial disorders: prevalence. myths and advances,2004,DR Thorburn,27,,3,349-362,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Summary: Disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are renowned for their variability in clinical features and genetic causes. This makes it difficult to determine their true prevalence. but recent studies have documented a minimum birth prevalence of 13.1/100 000 or 1/7634 for oxidative phosphorylation disorders with onset at any age. This clearly remains an underestimate but it indicates that oxidative phosphorylation disorders can be regarded as the most common group of inborn errors of metabolism. Pathogenic mutations causing human oxidative phosphorylation disorders have now been identified in more than 30 of the 37 mitochondrial DNA genes and in more than 30 nuclear genes. Most of the nuclear gene defects cause autosomal recessive diseases. but autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders also occur.

116848,Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP,2017,David R Thorburn and Joyeeta Rahman and Shamima Rahman,,,,,,CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP (neurogenic muscle weakness. ataxia. and retinitis pigmentosa) are part of a continuum of progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormalities of mitochondrial energy generation. Leigh syndrome (or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is characterized by onset of symptoms typically between ages three and 12 months. often following a viral infection. Decompensation (often with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or CSF) during an intercurrent illness is typically associated with psychomotor retardation or regression. Neurologic features include hypotonia. spasticity. movement disorders (including chorea). cerebellar ataxia. and peripheral neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. About 50% of affected individuals die by age three years. most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure. NARP is characterized by proximal neurogenic muscle weakness with sensory neuropathy. ataxia. and pigmentary retinopathy. Onset of symptoms. particularly ataxia and learning difficulties. is often in early childhood. Individuals with NARP can be relatively stable for many years. but may suffer episodic deterioration. often in association with viral illnesses. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome is established clinically in a proband with progressive neurologic disease with motor and intellectual developmental delay. signs and symptoms of brain stem and/or basal ganglia disease. raised lactate concentration in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. and any …,True,yCbVBT4AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,138,https://europepmc.org/article/nbk/nbk1173,5703194393782829523,/scholar?cites=5703194393782829523,,https://europepmc.org/article/nbk/nbk1173,0,0,0

Patients with genetic OXPHOS disorders form the largest group of inborn errors of metabolism. Unfortunately. there is still a lack of efficient therapies for these disorders other than management of symptoms. Developing therapies has been complicated because. although the total group of OXPHOS patients is relatively large. there is enormous clinical and genetic heterogeneity within this patient population. Thus there has been a lot of interest in generating relevant mouse models for the different kinds of OXPHOS disorders. The most common treatment strategies tested in these mouse models have aimed to up‐regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. in order to increase the residual OXPHOS activity present in affected animals and thereby to ameliorate the energy …,True,yCbVBT4AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,94,https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bph.12413,10399396317391616639,/scholar?cites=10399396317391616639,,https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/bph.12413,0,0,0

A pathogenic mutation in COA6. leading to substitution of a conserved tryptophan for a cysteine residue. results in a loss of complex IV activity and cardiomyopathy. Here. we demonstrate that the complex IV defect correlates with a severe loss in complex IV assembly in patient heart but not fibroblasts. Complete loss of COA6 activity using gene editing in HEK293T cells resulted in a profound growth defect due to complex IV deficiency. caused by impaired biogenesis of the copper-bound mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunit COX2 and subsequent accumulation of complex IV assembly intermediates.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) is transitioning from being a research tool to being used in routine genetic diagnostics. where a major challenge is distinguishing which of many sequence variants in an individual are truly pathogenic. We describe some limitations of in silico analyses of NGS data that emphasize the need for experimental confirmation. Using NGS. we recently identified an apparently homozygous missense mutation in NUBPL in a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency.

116890,Characterization of mitochondrial FOXRED1 in the assembly of respiratory chain complex I,2015,Luke E Formosa and Masakazu Mimaki and Ann E Frazier and Matthew McKenzie and Tegan L Stait and David R Thorburn and David A Stroud and Michael T Ryan,24,Human molecular genetics,10,2952-2965,Oxford University Press,Human mitochondrial complex I is the largest enzyme of the respiratory chain and is composed of 44 different subunits. Complex I subunits are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) DNA and their assembly requires a number of additional proteins. FAD-dependent oxidoreductase domain-containing protein 1 (FOXRED1) was recently identified as a putative assembly factor and FOXRED1 mutations in patients cause complex I deficiency; however. its role in assembly is unknown. Here. we demonstrate that FOXRED1 is involved in mid-late stages of complex I assembly. In a patient with FOXRED1 mutations. the levels of mature complex I were markedly decreased. and a smaller ∼475 kDa subcomplex was detected. In the absence of FOXRED1. mtDNA-encoded complex I subunits are still translated and transiently assembled into a late stage ∼815 kDa intermediate; but instead of transitioning …,True,yCbVBT4AAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC,58,https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article-abstract/24/10/2952/623776,11595283351530728847,/scholar?cites=11595283351530728847,,https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/24/10/2952/623776,0,0,0

Perturbations of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools are a recognized cause of mitochondrial genomic instability; therefore. we determined DNA copy number and dNTP levels in mitochondria of two models of MPV17 deficiency. In Mpv17 ablated mice. liver mitochondria showed substantial decreases in the levels of dGTP and dTTP and severe mitochondrial DNA depletion. whereas the dNTP pool was not significantly altered in kidney and brain mitochondria that had near normal levels of DNA. The shortage of mitochondrial dNTPs in Mpv17-/- liver slows the DNA replication in the organelle. as evidenced by the elevated level of replication intermediates. Quiescent fibroblasts of MPV17-mutant patients recapitulate key features of the primary affected tissue of the Mpv17-/- mice. displaying virtual absence of the protein. decreased dNTP levels and mitochondrial DNA depletion. Notably. the mitochondrial DNA loss in the patients’ quiescent fibroblasts was prevented and rescued by deoxynucleoside supplementation. Thus. our study establishes dNTP insufficiency in the mitochondria as the cause of mitochondrial DNA depletion in MPV17 deficiency. and identifies deoxynucleoside supplementation as a potential therapeutic strategy for MPV17-related disease. Moreover. changes in the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial deoxynucleotide homeostasis indicate a remodeling of nucleotide metabolism in MPV17 disease models. which suggests mitochondria lacking functional …,True,yCbVBT4AAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC,57,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005779,13302402364897895574,/scholar?cites=13302402364897895574,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005779,0,0,0

Four main questions were addressed in an attempt to make some progress towards a consensus diagnostic approach: What are the major limitations in diagnosis of respiratory chain dysfunction? What is the ideal approach to investigating children with a suspected respiratory chain disorder? Can we begin to develop consensus diagnostic criteria? Can we develop a quality assurance (QA) scheme for respiratory chain enzyme assays? The workshop demonstrated strong consensus on recognizing the limitations of current diagnostic approaches. on the ideal diagnostic approach and on the desirability of an enzyme QA scheme.

116905,Monolysocardiolipin in cultured fibroblasts is a sensitive and specific marker for Barth Syndrome,2006,Michiel Adriaan Van Werkhoven and David Ross Thorburn and Agi Kyra Gedeon and James Jonathon Pitt,47,Journal of lipid research,10,2346-2351,Elsevier,Barth Syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked recessive disorder that results in abnormal metabolism of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). CLs are decreased and monolysocardiolipins (MLCLs). intermediates in CL metabolism. are increased in a variety of tissues. Measurement of decreased CL levels in skin fibroblasts has previously been proposed as a diagnostic test for BTHS. We investigated whether elevated MLCL is specific for BTHS and whether the MLCL-to-CL ratio is a more sensitive and specific marker for BTHS. We measured CLs and MLCLs in skin fibroblasts from 5 BTHS patients. 8 controls. and 14 patients with biochemical and clinical findings similar to those in BTHS (group D). using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Vpr. have been studied in yeast expression systems. In our previous study [1]. employing the pCUP1-vpr copper-inducible expression cassette. Vpr was shown to cause growth arrest and structural defects. In this study yeast constitutively expressing vpr. through elevated copy number and/or elevated transcription levels. displayed no growth arrest in fermentative growth conditions while Vpr was produced at much lower levels than in the inducible expression system. However. such cells were respiratory deficient and unable to utilise ethanol or glycerol as the sole carbon source. They exhibited gross mitochondrial dysfunction displayed in the loss of respiratory chain complex I. II. III. IV and citrate synthase activities.

Here we review their role in the investigation of paediatric patients. The morphological changes may be macroscopic. such as developmental abnormalities of the brain in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. including ectopic inferior olives and the absence of corpus callosum and pyramids. Other changes are histological. such as rarefaction of the neuropil and endothelial prominence in Leigh syndrome. and spongiosis with neuronal loss and gliosis in Alpers disease. The ragged-red fibres typical of mitochondrial disease in adults are only rarely seen in skeletal muscle biopsies from children. On the other hand. dramatic ultrastructural changes involving the mitochondria may be seen in many organs. including the liver. heart and intestine.

COX-1 and COX-2) catalyze the committed step in prostaglandin synthesis. PGHS-1 and 2 are of particular interest because they are the major targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including aspirin. ibuprofen. and the new COX-2 inhibitors. Inhibition of the PGHSs with NSAIDs acutely reduces inflammation. pain. and fever. and long-term use of these drugs reduces fatal thrombotic events. as well as the development of colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In this review. we examine how the structures of these enzymes relate mechanistically to cyclooxygenase and peroxidase catalysis. and how differences in the structure of PGHS-2 confer on this isozyme differential sensitivity to COX-2 inhibitors. We further examine the evidence for independent signaling by PGHS-1 and …,True,Uu4tMTcAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC,3214,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.145,18290559694242783583,/scholar?cites=18290559694242783583,,http://education.expasy.org/cours/Outreach/Chimiscope/Publication/annurev.biochem.cyclooxygenases.pdf,0,0,0

Before 1991. only one PGHS had been described. the isozyme now called PGHS-1. COX-1 (for cyclooxygenase-1) or the constitutive enzyme. At that time Simmons and Herschman and their colleagues discovered mRNAs whose expression was induced in chicken and mouse fibroblasts in response to src and tumor-promoting phorbol esters. respectively. and which encoded proteins having 60% amino acid sequence identity with PGHS-1. Subsequent work has shown that the new protein. called PGHS-2. COX-2 or the inducible isoform. is very similar to PGHS-1 in structure but differs substantially from PGHS-1 with respect to its pattern of expression and its biology. The reason for the existence of the two PGHS isozymes is unknown. However. PGHS-1 and-2 are often coexpressed in the same cell and may act as parts of separate prostanoid biosynthetic systems that function somewhat independently to channel prostanoids to the extracellular milieu and the nucleus. respectively. PGHS-1 and-2 are interesting in the context of both structural biology and enzymology in that they are homodimeric. heme-containing. glycosylated proteins with two catalytic sites. Moreover. the enzymes have a novel mechanism for membrane attachment; they are anchored to one leaflet of the lipid bilayer through the hydrophobic surfaces of amphipathic helices rather than through transmembrane motifs typical of many integral membrane proteins. The isozymes are also important pharmacologically …,True,Uu4tMTcAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,2389,https://www.academia.edu/download/47482343/33157.full.pdf,3053369285112037130,/scholar?cites=3053369285112037130,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47482343/33157.full.pdf,0,0,0

This bifunctional enzyme comprises three independent folding units: an epidermal growth factor domain. a membrane-binding motif and an enzymatic domain. Two adjacent but spatially distinct active sites were found for its haem-dependent peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities. The cyclooxygenase active site is created by a long. hydrophobic channel that is the site of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug binding.

117421,The structural basis of aspirin activity inferred from the crystal structure of inactivated prostaglandin H 2 synthase,1995,Patrick J Loll and Daniel Picot and R Michael Garavito,2,Nature structural biology,8,637-643,Nature Publishing Group,Aspirin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects through selective acetylation of serine 530 on prostaglandin H 2 synthase (PGHS). Here we present the 3.4 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of PGHS isoform-1 inactivated by the potent aspirin analogue 2-bromoacetoxy-benzoic acid. Acetylation by this analogue abolishes cyclooxygenase activity by steric blockage of the active-site channel and not through a large conformational change. We observe two rotameric states of the acetyl-serine side chain which block the channel to different extents. a result which may explain the dissimilar effects of aspirin on the two PGHS isoforms. We also observe the product salicylic acid binding at a site consistent with its antagonistic effect on aspirin activity.,True,Uu4tMTcAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC,613,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsb0895-637,10588276145481958957,/scholar?cites=10588276145481958957,,,0,0,0

However. these deceptively simple. amphipathic molecules exhibit complex behavior when they self-associate and interact with other molecules. The phase behavior and assembled structures of detergents are markedly influenced not only by their unique chemical and physical properties but also by concentration. ionic conditions. and the presence of other lipids and proteins. In this minireview. we discuss the various aggregate forms detergents assume and some misconceptions about their structure. The distinction between detergents and the membrane lipids that they may (or may not) replace is emphasized in the most recent high resolution structures of membrane proteins. Detergents are clearly friends and foes. but with the knowledge of how they work. we can use the increasing variety of detergents to our advantage.,True,Uu4tMTcAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC,607,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820777537,14981120103140253920,/scholar?cites=14981120103140253920,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820777537,0,0,0

We have determined the structure of PGHS-1 at 3 angstrom resolution with arachidonic acid (AA) bound in a chemically productive conformation. The fatty acid adopts an extended L-shaped conformation that positions the 13proS hydrogen of AA for abstraction by tyrosine-385. the likely radical donor. A space also exists for oxygen addition on the antarafacial surface of the carbon in the 11-position (C-11).

A polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic investigation,1988,E Nabedryk and RM Garavito and J Breton,53,Biophysical journal,5,671-676,Cell Press,The orientation of the protein secondary structures in porin is investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) linear dichroism of oriented multilayers of porin reconstituted in lipid vesicles. The FTIR absorbance spectrum shows the amide I band at 1.631 cm-1 and several shoulders around 1.675 cm-1 and at 1.696 cm-1 indicative of antiparallel beta-sheets. The amide II is centered around 1.530 cm-1. The main dichroic signals peak at 1.738. 1.698. 1.660. 1.634. and 1.531 cm-1.

These studies imply that bound lipids have important roles that are crucial to the assembly. structure. or activity of the protein. Evidence for some of these roles in subunit interactions. membrane insertion. and protein–protein complex formation is reviewed.,True,Uu4tMTcAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC,56,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X07000966,13124447851016299858,/scholar?cites=13124447851016299858,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2395296/,0,0,0

117471,Salt intake augments hypotensive effects of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4: functional significance and implication,2009,Feng Gao and Dexin Sui and R Michael Garavito and R Mark Worden and Donna H Wang,53,Hypertension,2,228-235,Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,To test the hypothesis that activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel conveys a hypotensive effect that is enhanced during salt load. male Wistar rats fed a normal-sodium (0.5%) or high-sodium (HS; 4%) diet for 3 weeks were given 4α-phorbol 12.13-didecanoate (4α-PDD). a specific TRPV4 activator. in the presence or absence of capsazepine. a selective TRPV1 blocker. ruthenium red. a TRPV4 blocker. or TRPV4 small hairpin RNA that selectively knockdowns TRPV4. 4α-PDD (1. 2.5. or 5 mg/kg IV) dose-dependently decreased mean arterial pressure (P<0.05). HS enhanced 4α-PDD–induced depressor effects as well as 4α-PDD–mediated release of calcitonin gene–related peptide and substance P (P<0.001). Ruthenium red markedly blunted (P<0.001). whereas capsazepine slightly attenuated (P<0.05) 4α-PDD–induced depressor effects in HS and normal-sodium diet rats …,True,Uu4tMTcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,53,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/hypertensionaha.108.117499,295800286349574447,/scholar?cites=295800286349574447,,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.117499,0,0,0

Pharma-cologists have long been interested in COX as it is the primary target of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"""". a class of drugs which include aspirin. ibuprofen. naproxen. and indomethacin.

117473,An examination of the source of the tyrosyl radical in ovine prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1,1995,Linda C Hsi and Curtis W Hoganson and Gerald T Babcock and R Michael Garavito and William L Smith,207,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2,652-660,Academic Press,A tyrosyl radical. which may initiate the cyclooxygenase reaction. has been detected in prostaglandin H synthase by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the crystal structure of ovine prostaglandin H synthase-1. Tyr348 and Tyr385 are in close proximity to the heme. We mutated these residues to phenylalanine to test for their involvement in tyrosyl radical formation. Native enzyme formed a tyrosyl radical centered at g=2.0036 with a width of 28 gauss. The Y348F mutant formed a singlet signal similar to that of native enzyme with a width of 28 gauss (g=2.0039). In contrast. the radical signals seen with the Y385F and Y348F/Y385F mutants were 23 gauss (g=2.004) and 22 gauss (g=2.0037). In short. tyrosyl radicals are formed even in the absence of both Tyr348 and Tyr385. In Y345F containing mutants. a cluster of aromatic amino acids which surrounds the heme group may provide an alternate …,True,Uu4tMTcAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,47,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X85712375,5255612411326844774,/scholar?cites=5255612411326844774,,,0,0,0
