The effect of variation of the jet exit Reynolds number (Re) on boiling incipience. fully developed nucleate boiling. and critical heat flux (CHF) are documented. The jet exit Re is varied by variations of the jet exit velocity and the jet nozzle diameter for a fixed surface diameter. High-speed visualization is used to supplement trends observed in the heat transfer data. Scenarios of low and high incipience wall superheat are identified. corresponding to partially or fully developed nucleate boiling condition upon initiation of boiling. For the high incipience wall superheat scenario. the time of spread of boiling activity over the heated surface during temperature overshoot is found to be inversely proportional to the wall superheat temperature at boiling incipience.

A large-aspect-ratio channel with a depth of 600 μm restricts the thickness of the weak solution film. while ammonia vapor bubbles are injected from a porous wall. Experiments are performed at a nominal system pressure of 6.2 bar absolute and at an inlet weak solution temperature of 75 °C. A counter flowing coolant at a fixed inlet temperature of 58 °C removes the generated heat of absorption. The mass flow rate of the weak solution. vapor flow rate. and mass flow rate of the coolant solution are varied. Results indicate that a desirable operating condition for the absorber considering both heat and mass transfer attributes is obtained for a flow rate of 1.5 g/min of vapor and 35 g/min of weak solution.

The model integrates different factors related to end-user behaviour and decision-making regarding the management of electrical energy consumption. and integrates a gradual end-user response to home automation measures. The presented model aims to show the potential economic benefits obtained by the modelled changes of end-users’ behaviours within a smart energy network based energy system. Matlab/Simulink is used as a simulation tool for representing the model in which a 10 year database of Nordic climatic data has been built in. on an hourly and half hourly basis. The modelled building environment comprises twenty-one appliances and two lighting systems with different power rates. Each appliance and light bulb is individually measured. The feedback methods assessed were self-comparison. inter-comparison. and a target based system. The effect of home automation on energy consumption at the building level is assessed. and the importance of end-users in energy reduction is highlighted. The model categorises “green” and “brown” energy users and integrates their behavioural profiles within the end-user response. As part of a smarter electricity management system. the home automation system is able to interact with other buildings. either in terms of geographic or building infrastructure similarities.

Another potential of SG is to redistribute energy profile. It was found that the residential sector is the best source for demand reduction and static peak shifting. not only because of its potential for savings. but due to regulatory support in form of enabling programmes (Darby et al 2012). The EU sees smart grids as an energy structure allowing the integration of end-users (Giordano and Fully 2012). thus enhancing energy efficiency. In order to support the 2050 decarbonization goal through smart grids. the European Technology Platform for Smart Grids (2012) published its Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) towards 2035. The SRA concluded that SG research must analyse electricity systems as an integrated system. enhanced with other energy carriers such as heat and mobility demand.2 Objectives of the research This research intends to analyse some key elements of the future smart energy network (SEN). This includes the study of building energy efficiency through optimization of the building–grid communication (Louis et al. 2013b). study the smart electricity grid in concert with heat demand provided by district heat and bio-energy. and some other storage functions in urban contexts. such as plug-in cars (Caló et al. 2013).

The idea was to utilise new and existing technologies which have not been tried in a rural environment before. such as gasification. pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion. Targeted were especially SMEs which generate organic by-products and waste. such as of food and biotechnology industries.MicrE aimed to provide a service to develop small scale renewable energy solutions. some of which will use waste as a resource. These solutions would use new technologies available for generating energy from waste. and adapt them to suit SME’s and local organisations of the size and character that typify NP rural regions. The overall goal of MicrE was to enhance the capacity for self-sustaining business in rural NP regions. The objectives were to make new small-scale renewable energy technologies. especially energy from waste available to SME’s and organisations in rural NP regions on a scale that is viable and economically feasible; and to embed them within specific organisations within the partner regions to demonstrate the benefits they can deliver.,True,W5bTTYsAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC,0,http://nortech.oulu.fi/MicrE_files/WP3_Report.pdf,,,,,http://nortech.oulu.fi/MicrE_files/WP3_Report.pdf,0,0,0

INTRODUCTION mechanistically by Bui and Dhir (1985). Experiments were performed by Toda and Mori (1982) to obtain interfacial parameters for subcooled film boiling on a horizontal wire and a sphere. The wire diameter was 0.3 mm and the sphere was 12. 7 mm in diameter. Vapor film thickness. heat transfer rates and minimum film boiling temperatures were measured. The vapor film thickness was found to vary with time. The magnitude and frequency of oscillations was found to decrease with increased subcooling. Unfortunately they neither correlated their data nor compared them with results from existing analyses. Vijaykumar and Dhir (1989) obtained experimental results for wall and liquid heat fluxes near the leading edge of a vertical wall during subcooled film boiling of water. The heat flux from the interface into the liquid and liquid temperature profiles in the liquid thermal layer were measured using holographic interferometry. The role of the waves in modifying the liquid side heat transfer was quantified. This work is an extension of our earlier work and we aim to develop a physical understanding of the effect of the interfacial waves on hydrodynamics in the liquid layer adjacent to the interface. Hence the aim of the study is:Subcooled film boiling has been studied extensively in the past because of its applications in quenching of an overheated nuclear reactor core after a loss of coolant accident. cooldown of superconducting magnets and heat treatment of metals.

1329646,Challenges Associated with Hydrogen Generation Modeling in Small Modular Reactors,2013,Julie Jarvis and Allen Vieira,,,,,IASMiRT,This paper discusses the challenges associated with hydrogen generation modeling in Small Modular Reactors (SMR). SMRs have particular design characteristics which can substantially delay and potentially eliminate significant hydrogen generation. The core may never be uncovered. As a result. hydrogen release may not occur or the hydrogen generated can be less than expected from the amount of Zirconium in the core. The challenge then is to determine a more realistic limited hydrogen release versus an instantaneous release using acceptable analysis tools and methods. Computer codes to evaluate hydrogen generation include GOTHIC. MAAP5 and MELCOR which allow the analyst to optimize the design of hydrogen control equipment for design basis and severe accidents.

The impact was assessed by performing a number of sensitivity calculations for two severe-accident scenarios (ie. a station blackout and a large-break loss-of-coolant accident) for a typical pressurized water reactor with a large. dry containment. The MELCOR peer review identified concerns regarding the correlations used in the MELCOR code. A comprehensive review of the heat and mass transfers correlations in MELCOR was performed. New and improved correlations were identified for implementation within the code. Using this review as a basis. scoping analyses were performed to identify possible candidates for replacement. and a criterion was applied to select the correlations for implementation within the MELCOR framework. The correlations chosen for analyses are natural and forced convection on heat structures and in debris beds. boiling in rod bundles. and condensation on heat structures.,True,AFUpljsAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/89340,,,,,,0,0,0

It includes a wide range of features and constraints. such as stochastic parameters. multiple reserve products. energy storage units. controlled and uncontrolled energy transfers. and. most significantly. multiple energy sectors. The formulation is based on mixed-integer programming and takes into account unit commitment decisions for power plants and other energy conversion facilities. Both high-level large-scale systems and fully detailed smaller-scale systems can be appropriately modelled. The framework has been implemented as the open-source Backbone modelling tool using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). An application of the framework is demonstrated using a power system example. and Backbone is shown to produce results comparable to a commercial tool. However. the adaptability of Backbone further enables the creation and solution of energy systems models relatively easily for many different purposes and thus it improves on the available methodologies.

1329656,Microgrid as a cost-effective alternative to rural network underground cabling for adequate reliability,2018,Sanna Uski and Erkka Rinne and Janne Sarsama,11,Energies,8,1978,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Microgrids can be used for securing the supply of power during network outages. Underground cabling of distribution networks is another effective but conventional and expensive alternative to enhance the reliability of the power supply. This paper first presents an analysis method for the determination of microgrid power supply adequacy during islanded operation and. second. presents a comparison method for the overall cost calculation of microgrids versus underground cabling. The microgrid power adequacy during a rather long network outage is required in order to indicate high level of reliability of the supply. The overall cost calculation considers the economic benefits and costs incurred. combined for both the distribution network company and the consumer. Whereas the microgrid setup determines the islanded-operation power adequacy and thus the reliability of the supply. the economic feasibility results from the normal operations and services. The methods are illustrated by two typical. and even critical. case studies in rural distribution networks: an electric-heated detached house and a dairy farm. These case studies show that even in the case of a single consumer. a microgrid option could be more economical than network renovation by underground cabling of a branch in order to increase the reliability.

The analysis is performed in two different geographic locations that have a large difference in the solar resource. The results from around 400 scenario runs demonstrate to what extent lower investment costs mitigate the resource variability. In this regard. PV is more sensitive than wind power. Given the assumptions utilized. the model starts to invests in PV at much higher cost levels in Iberia (~ 1050€/kW) than in Northern Europe (~ 400€/kW). Furthermore. in Iberia batteries benefit PV strongly (already at 300€/kWh) while in Northern Europe batteries are not as relevant. since PV has a strong seasonal variation that cannot be economically mitigated with batteries and the region already has high amounts of flexible reservoir hydro power.,True,PGkixwkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/44292461/Cost_optimal_share_of_wind_power_PV_and_20160401-2417-14k5l8h.pdf,9308691631280669292,/scholar?cites=9308691631280669292,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44292461/Cost_optimal_share_of_wind_power_PV_and_20160401-2417-14k5l8h.pdf,0,0,0
1329660,Modelling framework for power systems,2014,Juha Kiviluoma and Erkka Rinne and Niina Helistö and Miguel Azevedo,,"VTT, Espoo",,,,Over the past years VTT has developed a platform that combines different energy system models under the same user interface and database. The platform is called Sceleton. The purpose of the platform is to enable accurate modelling of future energy systems with large amounts of variable generation mainly from wind power and PV. A single model cannot achieve this. since variable generation will impact several very different time resolutions. These require specific models. The platform currently connects three models: Balmorel. WILMAR and PSS/E (Figure 1). Balmorel is used for generation planning. It takes variability into account by forcing chronological constraints related to eg hydro power reservoirs. WILMAR is a unit commitment and dispatch model. which can take stochastic inputs for wind power. PV. and load forecasts. It has a 36 hour horizon and typically rolls through the whole year. PSS/E is a power system simulator. which can be used for static or dynamic power system stability studies. The operation of the models can be interlinked. Balmorel sends investment decisions to WILMAR. which then analyses operational costs in more detail. WILMAR in turn sends nodal electricity demand as well as unit dispatch to PSS/E. which can then be used for analysing the power flows and the stability during and after disturbances. Relevant constraints can then be fed back to the upper level model for iteration. Sceleton uses a single database to hold input data to all models. This ensures consistency between model inputs and reduces overhead on database maintenance. since there are overlapping inputs.

Local flexibility market. Smart Otaniemi is a smart energy piloting area and ecosystem in Otaniemi. Espoo. This report includes a state-of-the-art analysis of local markets. especially in Germany and the UK. and of the system wide markets in Finland. in which demand response can almost conclusively participate. aggregated or not. The notion of local flexibility markets hits the first snag with the question of who will buy the local flexibility in Finland: analysis shows that it is not other end-users. not the seller per se. nor the local generator unless it is a clearly better solution than selling to the energy market. For example. although a small end-user does not participate in the spot market directly. she can use her flexibility via market price based contracts. The main answer is the DSO. The DSO’s demand for flexibility might have different reasons such as local ancillary service needs or fighting bottlenecks. However. in general. flexibility should be available for multiple uses in order to enable value stacking. Local energy markets could be practical for reasons other than the utilization of flexibility for the management of the local network. Local markets could enable more specialised or granular trading. especially if trading is not possible on existing markets for the interested stakeholders. In addition. the local markets could act as an aggregation platform for existing markets. The more markets and interested parties. including independent aggregators. are involved. the more important and complicated balance settlement will become.

1329662,Reply to ‘The perils of automated fitting of datasets: the case of a wind turbine cost model’,2019,Erkka Rinne,,Nature Energy,,,Nature Publishing Group,Assessing the investment costs of wind power plants with different technological parameters is a challenging task. Previously. a cost model to predict specific investment costs using chosen technology parameters was created by fitting a function to cost data. The model. however. shows incorrect scaling behaviour with large installed capacity. A new model was tested with the original data. but it is difficult to estimate its quality without an extensive analysis.Klöckl et al. 1 raised justified critique towards the wind power plant (WPP) cost model described in our previous article 2 on the effects of turbine technology development and land use on wind power resource potential. The cost model for predicting specific investment costs (EUR/kW) of a wind power plant consists of two parts. The site-independent part is described by the turbine rotor diameter and specific rating (generator capacity per rotor swept area. W m− 2) as well as the tower height. The site-dependent part is described by the properties of the site: cost of building road and transmission grid connection to the wind power plant. Klöckl et al. argued that the site-independent part of the model exhibits a considerable generalisation error: the total cost of a wind power plant becomes negative with large amounts of installed power due to incorrect scaling behaviour of the model.

1329668,Stochastic Power System Simulation with Energy Storages,2014,Erkka Rinne,,,,,,The share of variable generation such as wind or solar power is increasing globally. This calls for more accurate simulation tools for assessing the operational effects of variable generation in power systems. Energy storages are a source of power system flexibility. but modelling them is a challenging task. There is not much literature on storage scheduling concerning stochastic variable generation. A new stochastic energy storage scheduling tool for power system simulations was developed. The methodology is based on existing literature. but several improvements were made including modelling of pumped hydro storages. The scheduling tool uses stochastic electric power demand. wind and solar power feed-in as well as hydropower inflow time series to describe the uncertain future. The model objective is to minimise expected generation cost while satisfying the demand for electric power. The modelling tool was used in a demonstrative case study set up in the South African power system in the year 2030. The case study was based on governmental plans for the future investments in a large expansion of the shares of wind and solar power. The storage options in the case study were reservoir hydropower with natural inflow and pumped storage hydro power. The results show that the model is functional. No further conclusions can be made from the simple case study results. and a more advanced setting is needed for further development and research results.

To describe the marginal value of a reservoir connected to a hydropower plant the term water value is used. In an electricity system with both hydropower and thermal capacity. water value is equal to the absolute change of total production costs when there is one unit more water available. Water value is a function of time and reservoir filling level. The less water in the reservoirs. the more valuable it is. Annual water inflow is unequally spread over the year and therefore affects the available amount of water and the water values.,True,PGkixwkAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://cris.vtt.fi/en/publications/improving-water-values-in-a-stochastic-electricity-market-model,,,,,,0,0,0

Vesiarvo kuvaa säännösteltävän vesialtaan marginaaliarvoa. ja sähköjärjestelmässä. jossa on sekä vesivoimaa että lämpövoimalaitoksia. vastaa vesiarvo sähköntuotannon kokonaiskustannusten muutosta kun käytettävissä on yksi yksikkö enemmän vettä. Vesiarvo on ajan ja altaan täyttöasteen funktio; mitä vähemmän altaissa on vettä. sitä arvokkaampaa se on. Epätasaisesti vuoden aikana jakautunut tulovirtaama vaikuttaa saatavilla olevaan vesimäärään ja siten myös vesiarvoihin.

1329673,Author’s manuscript (pre peer-review),,Juha Kiviluoma and Erkka Rinne and Niina Helistö,,,,,,More flexible power systems can accommodate variable power generation (VG. consisting mainly of wind power and photovoltaics) more economically (Kiviluoma 2013). As the share of VG increases in different power systems. it becomes important to understand what options there are to increase power system flexibility and also how they rank against each other and how they impact each other. This paper presents how different sources of flexibility can be implemented in scheduling models as well as an outcome from an economic comparison in a particular power system.In power systems. flexibility is sometimes understood as the capability to meet ramps. However. we encompass a wider meaning by considering also other impacts of variability. Ramps in the Northern European power system are not a large issue due to a very large balancing area and a high share of flexible reservoir hydropower. although there certainly will be local issues as well as control issues that need to be addressed as the share of variable generation increases. More importantly variable generation will push out a changing portion of the fuel based generation during the year. This would trigger a shift from lower cost base load generation to higher cost intermediate or peaking generation. Flexibility. as understood in this paper. can partially mitigate this by decreasing consumption during the peaks and by increasing consumption in the lows.,True,PGkixwkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juha_Kiviluoma/publication/319067616_Comparison_of_flexibility_options_to_improve_the_value_of_variable_power_generation/links/59a910da0f7e9b27900de99c/Comparison-of-flexibility-options-to-improve-the-value-of-variable-power-generation.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juha_Kiviluoma/publication/319067616_Comparison_of_flexibility_options_to_improve_the_value_of_variable_power_generation/links/59a910da0f7e9b27900de99c/Comparison-of-flexibility-options-to-improve-the-value-of-variable-power-generation.pdf,0,0,0

Higher hub heights reach higher average wind speeds while lower specific ratings (rated power per turbine swept area) improve the capacity factors. We evaluated the effects of wind turbine technology and hub height on the wind power potential. Also. various land use restrictions to wind power development were considered using Finnish wind resource data as an example.The results indicate that the selected turbine technology. hub height and assumptions for land use play a significant role in evaluating wind power potential. Modern turbines with low specific rating improve the energy yield considerably in the Finnish onshore areas and higher capacity factors compensate for the lower installation density.

Lean is a technique that manages the construction process to eliminate wastes. reduce costs. and deliver projects on time by breaking the construction projects to smaller parts of activities. Previous studies found that the most critical barriers to implementing lean construction approach in Malaysia are lack of knowledge on the lean concept and lack of commitment from management. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential barriers in implementing lean thinking within the construction industry in the future in Malaysia. In order to implement lean thinking in construction activities. involved parties should understand the lean principles. lean construction techniques and causes of waste. As a result. postgraduate students from the faculty of civil engineering and built environment were evaluated regarding their knowledge on lean construction and management commitment. The data were collected through a questionnaire survey distributed to 140 postgraduate students who involved in the construction industry afterwards. The results showed that construction management students are familiar with the concept of lean thinking.

This system is a solution developed by daylighting designers to reduce operational costs and enhance comfort. As an innovative technology. fiber optic daylighting systems can illuminate building interiors efficiently compared with other daylighting strategies. However. as a transmission medium in daylighting systems. optical fibers require uniform light distribution in sunlight concentration. which could generate heat. Therefore. this study aims to investigate the effect of heat buildup produced by end-emitting fiber optic daylighting systems in tropical buildings. The applied method adopts a new fiber optic daylighting system technology from Sweden called Parans SP3. with a 10 m cable to be tested in an actual room size under the Malaysian climatic environment. particularly within the vicinity of the main campus of the Universiti Sains Malaysia. Results show that the system generated a temperature of 1.3 C under average conditions through fiber optic diffusers and increases indoor temperature by 0.8 C in a 60 m 3 room.

Belgium,Hoofdlijnen: Alle Vlaamse klimaatscenario’s wijzen eenduidig op een stijging van de omgevingstemperatuur (bijvoorbeeld met 1. 5 C à 4. 4 C voor de winter en met 2. 4 C à 7. 2 C voor de zomer). op een hogere verdamping tijdens de winter en de zomer. en ten slotte op meer neerslag tijdens de winter tegen 2100. Het zeeniveau aan de Vlaamse kust kan deze eeuw nog stijgen met 20 à 200 cm. De meeste klimaatscenario’s tonen een daling van de gemiddelde zomerneerslag voor Vlaanderen. In combinatie met de hogere verdamping doet dit de laagste rivierdebieten tijdens droge zomers met meer dan 50% dalen tegen het einde van de 21e eeuw. Daardoor stijgen de kansen op ernstig watertekort. Ondanks een daling van de zomerneerslag. valt er in Vlaanderen een toename van het aantal extreme zomeronweders te verwachten. Daardoor stijgen de overstromingskansen voor riolen. Het risico op economische schade door overstromingen ligt ver uit elkaar voor de verschillende klimaatscenario’s voor Vlaanderen: van een daling met 56% tot een stijging met 33%. Vlaanderen ligt tussen Noord-Frankrijk. waar de klimaatverandering de evolutie naar verdroging versterkt. en Nederland. waar men eerder een toename van het aantal overstromingen verwacht. Waterbeheerders in Vlaanderen moeten bij het opvangen van de gevolgen van de klimaatverandering (adaptatie) daarom zoeken naar ingrepen die vlot bij te sturen zijn en onder verschillende omstandigheden nuttig zijn.

In Flanders. data from the ETS are not used in the GHG inventories. In this paper. we compared the energy and emissions included in the ETS with the total energy consumption and CO2 emissions for the different industrial sectors. During the first period of the ETS (2005-2007). the average share of CO2 emissions was 45% of total CO2 emissions in Flanders. In 2008 the share even rose to 50%. due to an expanded scope of the ETS in the second trading period. We also examined the differences between the data reported under the ETS and the data used in energy balances and GHG inventories. This analysis shows differences in the calculated emissions in some industry sectors due to different approaches and definitions. Also. in sectors where derived fuels are used. ETS data and energy balances are not easily comparable. We conclude that the involvement of different authorities for GHG inventories and ETS necessitates consultation and coordination among all actors.

Climate Changes. Spatial Planning. Alterra,In the Environmental Outlook towards 2030 for the Flanders region of Belgium. information on the possible climate changes on water systems (rivers and catchment hydrology. urban drainage. coastal zone) and their consequences has been collected and compiled. The information has been derived from eleven research projects recently completed or still underway. In this way. a more define view of the possible changes has been achieved. In addition. new risk calculations for flood damage were carried out according to various scenarios. This information is crucial to allow the government and public authorities. but also industry. agriculture. environmental stakeholders. etc. in the region to adapt in time and purposefully to climate change and to be able to limit the socio-economic and environmental implications of flooding. water shortages or exceedance of water quality standards. Some key conclusions of the outlook are:• All climate scenarios for Flanders clearly indicate an increase in the ambient (air) temperature (eg by 1.5 C to 4.4 C in the winter and by 2.4 C to 7.2 C in the summer). a higher evaporation in the winter and summer and finally more precipitation during the winter by 2100. The sea level at the Flemish coast may rise by 20 to 200 cm this century.• The majority of climate scenarios indicate a drop in the average summer precipitation for Flanders. Combined with higher evaporation this will decrease the lowest river flows during dry summers by over 50% by the end of the 21st century. The chances of severe water shortages increase as a result.• Despite a drop in summer precipitation. an increase in the number of extreme summer …,True,ek_JGKEAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/1772503?limo=0,,,,,,0,0,0

While many developers focus on active adult communities with single-family homes. multifamily housing may also provide a desired option for some Boomers. The Urban Land Institute (Haughey. 2003) predicts that Boomers will downsize when they become empty-nesters and that rental apartments or condominiums could provide an attractive smaller housing option. Boomers may find the conveniences associated with rental apartments (no yard work.“lock and leave” features. no exterior maintenance. amenities such as pools and gyms) to be an attractive alternative to single-family housing.

The 2011 American Housing Survey data with a sample of 2.326 senior residents age 55 and over with physical disability and living in multifamily housing built between 1970 and 2011 were analyzed. We compared senior residents living in multifamily before (1970-1990) and after (1991-2011) the FHAA. The results show that senior residents living in multifamily housing before the FHAA were at a greater disadvantage because they were more likely to live in older buildings located in urban areas. yet paid lower rent and received government subsidies. This study confirmed that the FHAA enabled residents of multifamily housing to have more home accessibility features. However. there was no significant difference in perceived home accessibility problems between the two groups. indicating that senior residents in multifamily housing have experienced home accessibility problems both before and after the FHAA.

1329797,Boomers’ Intention to Choose Healthy Housing Materials: An Application of the Health Belief Model,2019,Hyun Joo Kwon and Mira Ahn,11,Sustainability,18,4869,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This study aims to understand the decision-making process of healthy housing material selection of boomers who were born between 1946 and 1964 in the United States within the Health Belief Model (HBM) framework incorporating personal factors. The main constructs were three HBM components (perceived benefits. threats. and barriers). personal domains (knowledge. health concerns. and sensitivity to housing materials). and behavioral intention to choose healthy housing materials. With a nationwide random sample of boomers living in their homes (N= 306). path analysis was used to test the proposed research model. The findings indicate that behavioral intention to choose healthy housing materials is influenced by perceived benefits and threats. Of the personal factors. the knowledge component is directly and indirectly significantly associated with the behavioral intention. Insignificant association of perceived barriers and other personal components (health concerns and sensitivity) to the intention and the HBM components yield meaningful implications and discussions. The contribution of the HBM application to this study is to provide a foundation for understanding healthy housing material choosing behaviors for the general prevention of potential health issue purposes rather than actual maintenance.

Also. it identified people who are at greatest risk of mobility disability and living in homes without housing accessibility. We analyzed the 2011 American Housing Survey data with a sample of 20.089 households aged 55 and over living in single-family homes. Results show that although residential satisfaction decreased as mobility became more disabled. the key housing accessibility features were significant buffers against the negative impact of mobility disability on residential satisfaction. Seniors who were Black. low-income. housing-costs burden and renters in older housing in an urban area were more likely to have mobility limitations but fewer housing accessibility features. The moderating effect of housing accessibility on residential satisfaction was much greater for seniors with greater mobility disability. For vulnerable seniors living in an old single-family home. housing policymakers or local communities should consider home modification programs and services after evaluating housing accessibility.,True,Mg5bdrMAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,0,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201813639170476.page,,,,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201813639170476.pdf,0,0,0

Hydrogen is used in the chemical industry. is a promising energy carrier to store electric power from renewables and can play a large role in future mobility and steel industry. Currently. hydrogen is mainly produced by partial oxidation of natural gas. For defossilising the future energy supply new methods and processes for hydrogen production need to step in.  The German Aerospace Center (DLR) investigates environmentally friendly hydrogen production paths which do not use fossils fuels.

They are technologically mature reaching electrical efficiencies around 60 % (based on the lower heating value). Hybrid power plants consisting of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and gas turbines (GT) can reach higher electrical efficiencies and can be built at smaller installed power [1]. For the design and simulation of process systems with fuel cells or electrolyzers as main components it is beneficial to develop electrochemical reactor models. which are fast. accurate and experimentally adaptable. Calculation time is an important factor in complex system simulations. To achieve a good accuracy in a wide operation range a physically meaningful model is required. Furthermore the model should be adaptable to different reactor types by using experimental results to find model parameters. In general the performance of a SOFC is significantly determined by the total area specific resistance (ASR) that accounts for ohmic. activation and concentration polarization losses. Literature provides various models [2. 3. 4]. However. these models are electrochemically complex. Therefore it is necessary to develop a model that can be parameterized through a limited number of experimental results and that provides a tradeoff between calculation time and accuracy.  This contribution shows two experimentally validated models. Firstly. a simple ASR correlation is presented that is fitted to experimental test results of a commercially available stack. This model has a high …,True,cgsafqMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://elib.dlr.de/111217/,,,,,,0,0,0

Reversible solid oxide cell (rSOC) reactor systems can efficiently operate in electrolysis operation to convert electrical energy to chemical energy or in fuel cell mode to convert chemical energy back to electrical energy. Natural gas is widely used in the chemical industry as a source of energy and hydrogen. Hence. storing electrical energy in the form of synthetic natural gas can couple electricity arbitration with chemical process industries. A methane‐based rSOC system concept for the purpose of energy storage and sector coupling is investigated. A process system analysis is performed based on an experimental study of a commercially available rSOC reactor.

Several case studies have recently been reported to extend its applications for processing various mineral fines with limited success. A few empirical models have also been developed. but there has been hardly any attempt to understand the basic particle separation mechanism inside this equipment. An attempt has. therefore. been made to understand the separation characteristics of coal fines in a Knelson concentrator. The entire exercise has revealed that this equipment can produce a clean coal ash content of 17% from a feed coal ash content of around 36%.

However. the hydraulic jump type-stilling basin is found to be the most efficient one. The main goal of this study is to introduce aₒ shape of baffle pier. which has maximum energy dissipation. In this study. 14 different models of baffle piers were used for dissipating water energy downstream a heading up structure. One row of each model of baffle piers was used with a fixed position. Bed material used for runs was a uniform sand d50= 0.8 mm. The dimensions of the scour hole for each run were measured and used for the comparison between the performances of the used models for energy dissipation. Results in general show that. models with concave surfaces make the flow to change its direction more than the others with low turbulence intensity in recirculation zone downstream baffle piers and dissipate more energy than other forms. This leads to a stable hydraulic condition and shorter stilling basins.

An important alternative for diesel fuel is vegetable oils. Coating combustion chamber elements with a ceramic material seems an effective solution for improving performance of these lower-quality fuels compared with No. 2D and also exhaust emission values. Because these engines called as LHR run at higher working temperatures. both performance of vegetable fuels and also emission values will improve. In the present study. surfaces of cylinder head. piston. exhaust and inlet valve of a diesel engine were coated with Al2O3-TiO2 by plasma spray method.

Ni could offer significant economic advantages if used as a catalyst for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived phenolics to produce aromatics. However. on unmodified Ni catalysts. the desirable direct deoxygenation reaction must compete with high rates of phenyl-ring hydrogenation and C–C hydrogenolysis reactions. which lead to low aromatics yields.

Among these alternatives. natural gas is a cleaner fuel and is abundant globally. Shale gas. a form of natural gas that also contains light alkanes (C2-C4). is presently being employed to produce olefins. which can be upgraded to higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. This thesis describes efforts to develop new catalytic materials and characterizations for the conversion of shale gas to fuels.  In the first half. silica supported Pt-Cr alloys containing varying compositions of Pt and Pt3Cr were used for propane dehydrogenation at 550°C. Although a change in selective performance was observed on catalysts with varying promoter compositions. the average nano-particle structures determined by in situ. synchrotron x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were identical. Further. this work presents a method for the characterization of the catalytic surface by these methods to understand its relationship with olefin selectivity. From this. we can gain an atomically precise control of new alloys compositions with tunable surface structures.  Once formed by dehydrogenation. the intermediate olefins are converted to fuel-range hydrocarbons. In the second half. previously unknown single site. main group Zn2+ and Ga3+ catalysts are shown to be effective for oligomerization and the resulting products follow a Schutlz Flory distribution.

A leading postulate is that iron active sites in this class of materials exist in an Fe-N 4 pyridinic ligation environment. Yet. molecular Fe-based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) generally feature pyrrolic coordination and pyridinic Fe-N 4 catalysts are. to the best of our knowledge. non-existent.

The Center for Innovative Strategic Transformation of Alkane Resources (CISTAR) plans to use shale gas extracted from shale rock formations as a bridge fuel to replace coal and oil while the US transitions to renewable energy like solar and wind. After methane. the largest components in shale gas are light alkanes such as ethane and propane. These can be catalytically converted to olefins. which can be further reacted to produce fuels. for example. Olefins from alkanes can be accomplished by dehydrogenation by promoted platinum alloys. This study compares the structure and chemical properties of Pt-Ga alloys on silica (SiO2) and ceria (CeO2) supports to determine if the support plays an important role in this chemistry. The catalysts containing different Pt: Ga ratios were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation. These catalysts were characterized by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) to determine if an alloy was formed. and if so. the structure of that alloy. Finally. the catalysts were tested in a fixed bed reactor. where it was found that the silica-supported Pt-Ga alloy has a selectivity of> 90% towards propylene. Understanding catalyst design can lead to higher catalytic conversion of substances and potentially an improved selectivity for the formation of preferred products. Pt-Ga on ceria is tested for comparison and there appears to behave differently from that on silica demonstrating the importance of the role of the support on these catalysts.,True,298rxoAAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/surf/2018/Presentations/60/,,,,,,0,0,0

Therefore. the purpose of the present study is to eliminate the fins from high-speed supercavitating vehicles and propose a new bank-to-turn heading control of this novel finless high-speed supercavitating vehicle which is composed of the cavitator at the nose and an oscillating …,True,zvGjpyIAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,0,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077546320948340,,,,,,0,0,0

1329881,Study on energy consumption and thermal comfort performance of geothermal-powered underfloor heating systems,,Amir Omidvar and Hossein Taghvaei and Hamed Taghvaei,,,,,,Geothermal heating systems are energy efficient. long life. low maintenance and environmentally friendly. The greatest disadvantage of these systems would be the high initial cost of installation. Much of this cost is related to underground loop field (well drilling/excavating and tubing). The size of underground loop and consequently loop pricing depends on the building heating energy demand. Previous studies have found. radiant heating is more energy efficient than forced air systems. So. it seems that by combining radiant hydronic floor heating with ground source heat pumps. we can reduce the required borehole size and installation cost of geothermal heating systems. In the present study. thermal performance of the geothermal radiant floor heating (GRFH) was compared to conventional geothermal forced air (GFA) systems in buildings with various use and occupancy. Results indicated that. by using a GRFH system in heating dominated climates. the underground loop size can be reduced significantly. It was shown that the heat pump compressor work and the required borehole length for a GRFH system are about 12-18% and 20-27% lower compared to GFA systems in residential and official buildings. respectively.,True,zvGjpyIAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,http://www.jmest.org/wp-content/uploads/JMESTN42351653.pdf,,,,,http://www.jmest.org/wp-content/uploads/JMESTN42351653.pdf,0,0,0

Providing keys to help the practice is a main subject to spread the large scale LCA evaluation and ensure a better urban planning trending to sustainable solutions. This objective is also motivated by local. national and European policies. particularly within the context of Paris COP21.

Indeed. the importance of environmental problems regarding e.g. climate change. human health. biodiversity and resource depletion justifies a more precise decision making process.  A life cycle simulation tool has been developed to model urban projects including various buildings. streets. green and other public spaces. and networks (drinking water. waste water. district heating...). This tool. developed in an object oriented approach. associates dynamic building energy simulation and LCA. complemented with modules for open spaces and networks. A set of environmental indicators is evaluated. e.g. resource depletion. energy and water consumption. global warming. waste generation. toxicity. Several alternatives can be compared. constituting an urban design aid. Continuous improvement of the tool has been performed since the 90’s. expanding the boundaries from buildings to districts assessment. A dynamic model was recently introduced to take into account temporal variation of the electricity consumption in buildings and interaction with the electricity system. Results show the importance of this dynamic evaluation in the case of plus-energy buildings. This multidisciplinary approach allows comprehensive assessment of districts. constituting a decision support in early phases of urban projects.

Aunque no existe consenso sobre una única significación de la gobernanza. una de las acepciones más extendidas es la forma en la cual el poder es ejercido en la conducción de los recursos económicos y sociales de un país. Tal es el enfoque del Banco Mundial (2007) que ha desarrollado indicadores de gobernanza a nivel mundial. cubriendo 212 países y territorios. a través de 6 dimensiones:(i) Participación y rendición de cuentas;(ii) estabilidad política y ausencia de violencia;(iii) eficacia del gobierno;(iv) calidad regulatoria;(v) estado de derecho; y (vi) control de la corrupción.

1329934,Income Inequality in Mexico and Import Exposure: Estimating the Impacts from the Expenditure Channel,2019,Juan S Blyde,,,,,Inter-American Development Bank,A rise in import competition can put downward pressure on local prices. increasing consumer welfare. but these gains might be unequal across households depending on the basket of goods they consume. Using a consumer price index for Mexico that varies at the product and city level. this paper analyzes the impact of import competition from low-wage countries. particularly China. on price growth between 2002 and 2017. I find that the trade shock impacted prices. Had import competition remained unchanged. the 15-year change in the consumer price index would have been 7 percentage points higher. on average across all goods. with a much larger impact on products that are highly exposed to import competition. Second. using microdata from a household expenditure survey. I find that all households benefited from this access to cheaper goods. but low-income households benefited more. Finally. I look at these results in the context of income inequality in Mexico. noting that overall income inequality in the country declined during the period of analysis. I show that the pro-poor bias of the China shock contributed to this decline in inequality but only slightly. suggesting that additional factors might have been behind this trend.,True,0ItD950AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Income_Inequality_in_Mexico_and_Import_Exposure_Estimating_the_Impacts_from_the_Expenditure_Channel_en.pdf?download=true,,,,,https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Income_Inequality_in_Mexico_and_Import_Exposure_Estimating_the_Impacts_from_the_Expenditure_Channel_en.pdf?download=true,0,0,0

1329936,EU Energy Policy and the Third Package,2015,Joseph Dutton,,,,,,Energy has been a central feature of the EU since its initial inception as the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in the 1950s. A mainstay of successive policies has been to introduce ‘singularity’in to the sphere of energy at different scales–for example. from a narrow central pooling of physical resources. as with the ECSC. to much broader attempts at introducing a liberalised single market place for gas and electricity. and proposals for a single gas buyer mechanism under the 2015 Energy Union framework. These moves were typically internal responses to external events. such as the Arab oil embargoes or geopolitical tension between Russia and eastern European countries. To achieve the goal of a single internal energy market policies have sought to remove or reduce the friction placed on cross-border trade. governance and regulation of energy by often contradictory and conflicting national policies of member states. This has taken the form of specific and targeted pieces of legislation aimed at technical harmonisation. as well as wide-reaching sets of policies to overhaul entire sectors and governance and regulatory practice across all member states. This working paper sets out the path along which EU energy policy has moved since the initial creation of the organisation in the 1950s. detailing the principle documents and legislation upon which the current and proposed policies were constructed.,True,5XD9u2UAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,28,https://ukerc8.dl.ac.uk/UCAT/PUBLICATIONS/EU_energy_policy_and_the_third_package.pdf,8287428858040689905,/scholar?cites=8287428858040689905,,,https://ukerc8.dl.ac.uk/UCAT/PUBLICATIONS/EU_energy_policy_and_the_third_package.pdf,0,0,0

In addressing these and other global energy issues. the purpose of this book is to lay out the broad global energy landscape. exploring how these issues might develop in coming decades. and the implications of such developments for energy policy. There are great uncertainties. which will be identified. in respect of some of these issues. but many of the defining characteristics of the landscape are clear. and the energy policies of all countries will need to be broadly consistent with these if they are to be feasible and achieve their objectives. The book therefore provides information about and analysis of energy and related resources. and the technologies that have been and are being developed to exploit them that is essential to understanding how the global energy system is developing. and how it might develop in the future. But its main focus is the critical economic. social. political and cultural issues that will determine how energy systems will develop and which technologies are deployed. why. by whom. and who will benefit from them.

The aim is not to predict how this trade-off will be resolved in practice. but rather to lay out what is at stake on both sides of the equation. Since the late 2000s the electricity market in GB has become increasingly integrated with continental European markets through market coupling and increasing interconnection capacity. with further integration expected up to the mid-2020s. Estimates of the economic benefits of this integration range up to the order of several £100 m to £1bn a year. representing the economic cost of a reversal of such integration.

The pathway to Europe becoming climate-neutral is yet to be determined. but any inclusion of CCS in future plans must be within the broader aim of decarbonisation and not be viewed as a policy end in itself. To ensure this. there must be a proper understanding of how and where CCS might be best deployed to help deliver climate neutrality. This paper identifies the minimum requirements for CCS to have any role in Europe’s decarbonisation. building on experience from previous attempts to develop CCS.,True,5XD9u2UAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,0,https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/resrep24948.pdf,,,,,https://www.e3g.org/wp-content/uploads/04_06_20_CCS_learning_from_failure.pdf,0,0,0

1329958,The geopolitical & security implications of global unconventional gas development,,Joseph Dutton,,,,,,For many years natural gas was regarded as the poorer hydrocarbon cousin of oil. Considered to be of little economic value. associated gas was flared off as a by-product of crude oil production. while non-associated gas reserves were rarely considered for production other than in localised cases. Even today the practice of flaring associated gas is common in Russia and Africa. while gas is used in many fields as a means of increasing oil reservoir pressures. Recent years have seen a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of natural gas however. largely due to the meteoric rise of shale gas in the US. In 2011 the IEA asked if we are entering a ‘golden age’of gas. alluding to the established worries around ‘peak oil’and OPEC governance. and the more contemporary issues of energy security and de-carbonisation driving the rapid development of natural gas. with shale gas arguably the nucleus of this. 1 The oft-used labels of game changing and paradigm shifting have been liberally applied to the US shale gas revolution. with the impacts of rapid growth in domestic production making waves globally–in terms of traditional energy import-export relations. but also in economic. industrial. and political arenas. The forecast growth and abundance of natural gas in the future is set to alter existing structures and relations in energy and security. with the de-centralised and multi-faceted structure of gas differing greatly in comparison to oil.The profound predictions of shale gas in the future are understandable in view of the US experience. where shale has dragged the US from a net importer of gas to being self sufficient in the space of five years. while 60% of …,True,5XD9u2UAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,0,http://www.exeter.ac.uk/energysecurity/documents/ese_resources_May2012/Joseph_Dutton.pdf,,,,,http://www.exeter.ac.uk/energysecurity/documents/ese_resources_May2012/Joseph_Dutton.pdf,0,0,0

Wind’s association with CO2 emissions became increasingly negative after the Great Recession (i.e.. suppressed emissions at a greater rate). Nuclear’s association with CO2 resembled a distorted U-shaped curve over time. Biomass’ elasticity fluctuated between positive and negative values. Solar and geothermal’s elasticity remained fairly consistent over the course of the analysis. and hydro’s elasticity increased over time but remained negative throughout the study’s temporal period.

Findings indicate that renewable energy consumption has its largest negative effect on total carbon emissions and carbon emissions per unit of GDP in low-income countries. Contrary to conventional wisdom. renewable energy has little influence on total carbon dioxide emissions or carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP at high levels of GDP per capita. The findings of this study indicate the presence of a “renewable energy paradox.” where economic growth becomes increasingly coupled with carbon emissions at high levels of renewable energy. and the negative effect of economic growth on carbon emissions per unit of GDP lessens as renewable energy increases.

A growing body of research examines the drivers of RPS adoption. but this work has given scant attention to the ways in which the fossil fuel industry potentially moderates the effects of the other drivers of adoption. Therefore. we use discrete-time logistic regression analysis to estimate models of RPS adoption that include an interaction between fossil fuel production levels. and a commonly observed driver of adoption — state government ideology. We find that conservative. moderate. and liberal state governments are likely to adopt an RPS in states with no fossil fuel production.

However. due to data limitations. these studies have been limited to analyzing the years after 1960. Given that both theories discuss historical processes operating before 1960. analyzing pre-1960 data is warranted to more comprehensively test the propositions made by both theories. We assess the long-term relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions from 1870 to 2014 using a sample of global North nations. We use Prais-Winsten regression models with time interactions to assess whether. when. and how much CO2 emissions have decoupled from economic growth over time.

The quantitative analysis in this report has been used to support the discussion and conclusions of the Future Grid Forum which are published separately in Change and choice. Besides exploring scenarios and developing policy and technological options for public debate. a key objective of the Future Grid Forum was to develop credible. whole of system modelling of the electricity sector.In the past decade electricity futures have been modelled in increasingly finer detail by more and more sophisticated models. Electricity sector modelling has received a large amount of resources and in-depth treatment for three reasons. The first is because electricity assets are expensive and long lived so it is an essential to understand more about what futures the assets will be operating in. The second is that Australia’s National Electricity Market commenced in 1998 and so there was a need for companies to have tools in which to strategise their involvement in this new competitive wholesale electricity market environment. The third key driver of the last decade has been the need to understand how the sector can transform. under different policy settings. to meet the long term goal of substantial greenhouse gas emissions reduction.,True,4zkjVp8AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,19,http://www.greencrossaustralia.org/media/9964676/modelling%20the%20future%20grid%20forum%20scenarios%20pdf.pdf,9727890390085958581,/scholar?cites=9727890390085958581,,,http://www.greencrossaustralia.org/media/9964676/modelling%20the%20future%20grid%20forum%20scenarios%20pdf.pdf,0,0,0
1329977,Australia's National Electricity Market after twenty years,2020,Alan Rai and Tim Nelson,53,Australian Economic Review,2,165-182,,The Hilmer reforms served electricity consumers well over the first post‐reform decade. However. three key issues emerged from the mid‐2000s: (i) a significant and largely unnecessary rise in network expenditures; (ii) emissions policy discontinuity; and (iii) a large increase in wholesale prices due to rising fuel prices and the sudden exit of generators. The consequence was a doubling in retail prices. Deficiencies in cost‐recovery mechanisms have meant price increases have disproportionately affected low‐income households. We propose three key reforms as rectification: (i) integrating emissions reduction and energy policies; (ii) boosting network capacity utilisation; and (iii) improving cost recovery mechanisms.,True,4zkjVp8AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,12,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8462.12359,215724773087081842,/scholar?cites=215724773087081842,,,,0,0,0

This article examines the validity of both these effects using spot pricing outcomes in South Australia (SA). which has one of the highest VRE penetrations worldwide. We find partial support for these two effects. While extremely low prices have become more frequent over time. extremely high prices have become less frequent.

This transformation poses challenges to system security and reliability and has triggered increased variability and uncertainty in electricity prices. By employing an exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (eGARCH) model. we gauge the effects of wind power generation on the dynamics of electricity prices in the NEM. We find that a 1 GWh increase in wind generation decreases daily prices up to 1.3 AUD/MWh and typically increases price volatility up to 2%. Beyond consumption and gas prices. hydro generation also contributes to an increase in electricity prices and their volatility. The cross-border interconnectors play a significant role in determining price levels and volatility dynamics. This underscores the important role of strategic provisions and investment in the connectivity within the NEM to ensure the reliable and effective delivery of renewable energy generation.

In the absence of cost-effective storage. production subsidies for VRE plant can create incentives to produce electricity at times the system may not need it. thereby severing the link between the spot market and financial incentives to generate. Such production subsidies can also reduce the incentive for new VRE plant to participate in ‘firm’ forward derivative markets.

The system modeling equations based on Kirchhoff's laws are a set of linear algebraic equations that characterize the relationships between each component in the system. They are applied as system constraints in the Lagrange multipliers method to optimize the design. The optimization minimizes the total thermal conductance for a fixed cooling capacity and total circulating water mass flow rate. The solutions of the optimization equations for a typical IECV system give a set of Pareto frontiers that reflect the trade-off between the thermal …,True,PolqeFgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931019326687,15650533679941106795,/scholar?cites=15650533679941106795,,,,0,0,0

Within this market. there are multiple stakeholder agendas. End–user needs and sustainable development goals are currently not considered through the customer–enterprise relationship and the applied product and service design process. Challenges inherent in the attempt to satisfy multiple stakeholder interests are complicated by short–term planning by humanitarian funding agencies.

This paper investigates the frame and modality of citizen participation in a European Horizon2020 smart city project.+ CityxChange. in Trondheim.+ CityxChange aims at enabling citizen participation and co-creation in the transition to a positive energy city. The question is “what are the prevailing approaches and practices in relation to citizen participation amongst the key actors involved in+ CityxChange? Which structures and processes have inhibited or fostered the participation mechanisms (eg. for. by. and of people) and practices in Trondheim?” Through participatory observations and interviews with key local actors and citizens. we found that the focus of+ CityxChange on efficiency and creating innovative solutions “for” people in partnership with the private sector has disturbed the “by” and “of” people mechanisms of participation. Citizens’ power and roles are not delegated to challenge or replace the project’s predetermined issue or plan. The anchorage of the project outside of the formal administrative structure has caused other functional barriers that inhibit citizen participation. rather than facilitate it.

1330012,The role of utility companies in municipal planning of smart energy communities,2018,Brita Fladvad Nielsen and Eirik Resch and Inger Andresen,,Sustainability and the City,,213,WIT Press,Bergen and Oslo municipalities focus on integrating energy concerns into city planning and regard this as an opportunity to further lower greenhouse gas emissions. Due to a lack of tools and clear definitions of what Smart Energy Communities (SECs) are and how planning should be done in order to affect the overarching emission reduction goals. utility companies end up taking a leading role as advisors and influence definitions and strategies in the final design. Based on two case studies of SEC projects in Norway. the authors highlight the need for increased work to create feasible and understandable definitions and strategies for the planning of SECs. In our case studies. city planners struggle to include energy aspects in the early planning phase and to align their objectives of citizen well-being and reduced private car dependency with energy concerns. At the same time. utility companies respond to the perceived threat of more self-sufficient communities by depicting a role closer to the end-user and by offering a pragmatic cost/benefit view on the planning of energy supply options.,True,l7EYtfgAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,7,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6iZTDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA213&dq=info:8qHMGKDCePkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=dVeWfu_Z7A&sig=uKKiAAGigZ28hceNR2w7A2ThSGA,17976331905515954674,/scholar?cites=17976331905515954674,,,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2486007/The+role+of+utility+companies.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

A debate about whether a smart city is a pragmatic solution for modern challenges or just a technology-led urban utopia is entangled with the vexed issue of governance. While ‘smart governance’has drawn unprecedented interest. the combination of its conceptual vagueness and broad applications couple with a lack of focus on its underlying international and local political paradigms have raised concerns about its utility. This study contributes to restoring attention to the original concept of governance. its differences with governing and government. and the potential challenges resulting from its functionality in its real. multi-layered. and complex contexts. This paper explores the intellectual connection between governance and smart cities. from both an empirical and a conceptual/analytical perspective. From the empirical side. we examine which actors. processes. and relational mechanisms at different levels that have had an impact on the initiation of smart cities in three Norwegian cities: Trondheim. Bergen. and Bodø. We illustrate how the structural sources of the interests. roles. and power in smart city initiatives have caused governance to emerge and change. but have also affected the goals designed by specific actors.,True,l7EYtfgAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,4,https://www.mdpi.com/2412-3811/5/4/31,2550188906198280823,/scholar?cites=2550188906198280823,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2412-3811/5/4/31/pdf,0,0,0

This transition depends upon cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer and balancing existing and new knowledge. Currently. Norwegian cities fail to balance the new (exploratory and bottom-up) and existing (exploitative) knowledge in their smart city demo projects. Balancing these and achieving ‘ambidextrous innovation’ is a key for open innovation.

Design thinking can address emerging challenges in the smart city paradigm. in a collaborative setting of diverse stakeholders. novel ideas and innovative approaches. Design and design thinking are abductive reasoning. seeking to identify how one can reach value-oriented goals through the combination of new connections between ‘how’ and ‘what’. Design thinking looks for ways to work with a ‘designerly’ mindset. and to unlock innovation potential through the application of different methods and processes.

Gothenburg,2019,Ruth Woods and Wenche Lerme and Brita Fladvad Nielsen,4,Urban Planning,1,67-77,PRT,This article sets out to describe the role of aesthetics in citizen dialogues during the upgrading of a local swimming pool in Hammarkullen. Gothenburg. The swimming pool became an important project because of its role in a larger neighbourhood renovation project that allowed the municipality to focus on citizen engagement and inclusion. The engagement process showed the importance of the local swimming pool for a marginalized group of women of Somali origin. and a decision was made to keep the swimming pool instead of demolishing it. This led to collaboration between project coordinators. the Public Art Agency. an artist and an architect. Individual qualitative interviews focusing on storytelling were undertaken with key stakeholders. The findings show that aesthetic quality mediated the communicative processes between project coordinators and citizens. Art in public space is more than just aesthetics or something to look at; art provokes a wide variety of responses and artists use a variety of means to engage with their public and creating dialogue. Yet the project managers failed to consider the creative process of the architect and her perspective on aesthetic quality and building functionality. Stakeholders take different stances to whether aesthetic quality can be a way of grounding. communicating and evolving. or whether it is a matter of beauty where the artist or architect takes the lead.

1330025,Experiential learning and reflection through video in field-based learning: lessons from Bhopal and Trondheim,2019,Brita Fladvad Nielsen and Hanne Vrebos and Rolee Aranya,3,Læring om læring,1,,,The first semester of the master program Urban Ecological Planning consists of extensive fieldwork and deep learning. Studying informal settlements of Indian cities require that students think action and are able to reflect upon own experiences. Sensory impressions represent a significant part of the students’ experience. and the course facilitators need to support reflection in an intense and challenging context. The students’ role as outsiders. their ambition to make a difference. and their professional role as future urban planners are challenged when meeting the realities of citizens in Bhopal. India. In fall 2018. a group of students stayed behind in Trondheim to do their fieldwork in the area Lademoen. As an educational experiment. we encouraged the students to not only reflect upon their experiences through written words on paper. but also to try to communicate and reflect visually. and deliver their reflections as videos. The results were beyond our expectations; the students delivered high quality short videos. showing how they interpreted their experiences. the course and the learnings about the communities in which they spent days. weeks and months together with. The students also explained that as they were filming and editing the videos. the process itself ‘did something’to the way they saw the complexity of the problems in front of them and how they made sense of the whole. This suggests that video reflections can help students complete the cycle of experiential learning [1]. something that can help them move towards a stage where it becomes easier for them to act based on their learning.,True,l7EYtfgAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,1,https://www.ntnu.no/ojs/index.php/lol/article/view/3040,9602173547155073965,/scholar?cites=9602173547155073965,,,https://www.ntnu.no/ojs/index.php/lol/article/download/3040/2948,0,0,0

1330029,Sustainable integration in Norway: A social systems design approach,2014,Ian Percy and Brita Nielsen,,,,,,Norway’s integration model is based on the premise that counties (kommuner) are the best judges of their ability to settle and integrate refugees. While in principle this free choice makes sense. the practice is unsustainable. I 2013 11.570 people sought asylum in Norway. and of those 5330 received asylum. thus becoming refugees. In 2013 the Integration and Diversity Department (IMDi) was able to settle 6551 refugees. however at the beginning of 2014. 5700 refugees were still waiting in asylum centers (mottak) in order to be settled in a county. How to settle and integrate these people has gained an increasing political focus both in Oslo and in counties throughout the country. Several questions have been raised. such as whether the asylum seekers should decide where to move to. and how many people from a very different cultural background and educational level an area can “sustain.” Based on experience as a refugee consultant in Austrheim kommune. together with open interviews with stakeholders in the kommune. the corresponding author has observed and had first-hand experience with systemic challenges worth investigating. Experiences suggest that the top down approach implemented by the central decision makers (IMDI) affects the relationship between the decision makers and implementers within the county receiving refugees. This again affects the chances of “integrating” refugees in the local community. and the willingness to choose to receive refugees in the future. Key factors that the leadership of a county see as relevant when deciding to settle refuges are that the reception of refugees also fits within the political …,True,l7EYtfgAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,1,http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/2095/,10329626276935906612,/scholar?cites=10329626276935906612,,,http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/2095/1/Percy_Sustainable_WorkingPaper_2014.pdf,0,0,0

They identify the market as a quasi-market in where the end-user is not the customer and this leads to added parameters being relevant for the design process. There is a gap in applicable methodologies when designing for markets where the purchaser is not the end-user and has no influence on the product selection or feedback and where the opportunities of cooperation are limited due to the nature of humanitarian relief.

1330033,Evaluation of the Energy Consumption Introduced by a Trust Management Scheme on Mobile Ad-hoc Networks.,2015,Andrea Lupia and Floriano De Rango,10,J. Networks,4,240-251,,Nodes in mobile ad-hoc networks communicate each other using the wireless transmission. Many protocols have been proposed allowing the establishment of multi-hop paths to connect source and destination nodes. The absence of a physical link between the nodes and the multi-hop routing lead to a lack of security. Different typologies of attack effective against MANETs have been investigated thoroughly. and many solutions have been proposed to take the required countermeasures. Many of them are based on the cryptography. protecting data with digital signatures and hash chains. but they are not useful when a fair node is compromised later in time. Using a Trust Management Scheme can help in these situations. allowing to evaluate dynamically if a node is trustworthy or not. The computation of a trust value requires the monitoring of the interactions between nodes. therefore it has an effect on the energy consumption. which is an important issue of ad-hoc networks. Energy availability is limited for the nodes in a MANET. so the security measures that they adopt must not excessively increase the consumption.,True,nuZG84kAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,17,https://www.academia.edu/download/45696563/Evaluation_of_the_Energy_Consumption_Int20160517-18219-8fl2th.pdf,11675782776908349232,/scholar?cites=11675782776908349232,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45696563/Evaluation_of_the_Energy_Consumption_Int20160517-18219-8fl2th.pdf,0,0,0

The MANET nature makes it subject to various types of security leaks. External nodes could interfere with the communication. fair nodes could be compromised at any time by malicious agents. Another issue regards the limited amount of energy available to nodes. so their behavior could become selfish under some conditions. Many proposals detect these behaviors using a trust management system. but the activity of packet monitoring is energy-consuming. The main aim of this proposal is the reduction of the energy required by the monitoring system without lowering detection performance.

Performing monitoring operations to establish whether a node is fair or not requires a large amount of energy. hence their reduction is desirable when they are not needed. A node behavior could dynamically change over time. because it could be compromised by external agents. or it could have a selfish behavior due to energy saving reasons. Thus. monitoring is needed also when a node behavior is fair in a given period of time. The proposed approach of dynamic monitoring could help in saving energy without affecting the accuracy of the IDS. For this purpose. we introduced a function that changes the probability of monitoring a packet depending on the …,True,nuZG84kAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,1,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7570518/,8064736657633162885,/scholar?cites=8064736657633162885,,,,0,0,0

In this scenario it is possible to perform internal and external attacks compromising the network functions. Moreover. the adoption of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to discover internal attacks is often energy consuming highly reducing the network lifetime. At this purpose. our proposal is the design and adoption of an energy-aware probabilistic monitoring module useful to IDS. to better perform in a MANET scenario where not only security but also energy constraints need to be accounted.

1330045,Trust management analysis and proposal of trust-based energy-efficient intrusion detection system for wireless ad-hoc networks,2017,Andrea Lupia and Felice Crupi and Floriano De Rango,,,,,,The security and the energy consumption are key aspects of distributed wireless ad-hoc networks. The major issues regarding security are due to the lack of an infrastructure and the use of the wireless medium for transmission and reception of data. therefore the communication could be easily disturbed or eavesdropped. or the nodes could be corrupted by malicious agents. The limited power source available to the nodes puts a severe constraint to the operations that a node can execute. This implies that any adopted measure to detect malicious behaviors must take into account the required energy. reducing it to the minimum. so the node lifetime will not be excessively affected. In Chapter 2. an overview of various typologies of wireless ad-hoc network is given. analyzing what they have in common. and what distinguish them. The transmission technologies for wireless communication and their last enhancements are illustrated. analyzing the energy consumption they imply and the supported transmission data rates. The most known routing protocol for wireless ad-hoc networks published as RFC are described. eventually defining and categorizing the many threats to which they are subjected. As countermeasure to these threats. the state of the art concerning the Intrusion Detection Systems on resource-constrained devices is depicted in Chapter 3. A common classification based on the techniques used by IDS to analyze the traffic is introduced. defining advantages and drawbacks of each technique. Main IDS architectures are hence described. defining the scenarios in which they perform better.

Innovations in agriculture. transport. and communications have all improved our standard of living. However. despite ongoing advancements. the principle model of industrialization has remained largely unchanged. as it was–and still is–characterized by linear consumption. After consumer goods become redundant they turn into waste. putting significant strain on our planetary limits. In western economies we have developed a ‘take-make-consume and dispose’-mentality based on the assumption that ‘resources are abundantly available. easy to source and cheap to dispose of’. 1 However. as the world’s population grows towards 7.5 billion people. with a burgeoning middle class demanding access to increasingly sophisticated goods. the burden on our natural boundaries looks set to increase further.A transition towards a ‘circular economy’-in which redundant consumer goods are viewed as input rather than waste-offers great potential for societies to reduce their environmental footprint. Once products reach the end of their lifespan new value can be generated by re-using valuable resources. 2 The circular economy is characterized by its ability to restore and regenerate through intention and design:‘[i] t replaces the ‘end-of-life’concept with restoration. shifts towards the use of renewable energy. it removes the use of toxic chemicals. which impair re-use. and aims for the elimination of waste through a superior design of materials. products. systems. and. within this. business models’. 3 The circular economy is not …,True,I4TGZ1gAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,8,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=MTImDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA44&dq=info:y-ughtpPWEEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=lAtCo2V200&sig=ElBxgFpbUHvD6E68tAlIZYJH6D8,4708601210396011467,/scholar?cites=4708601210396011467,,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=MTImDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA44&dq=info:y-ughtpPWEEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=lAtCo2V200&sig=ElBxgFpbUHvD6E68tAlIZYJH6D8,0,0,0

1330059,Beyond the Welfare State,2015,Artur Usanov and Eline Chivot and Pavel Kogut,,,,,,The modern welfare state is under stress. The Great Recession has had a severe impact on public finances in the Netherlands and in many other EU member states. While the pace of fiscal consolidation remains a very controversial topic. few would dispute the need to move public finances towards a more sustainable trajectory at some point in the future. Given that social spending constitutes the largest share of public expenditure in the Netherlands. it is inevitable that the questions about the affordability of existing welfare programs are being raised. The modern welfare state is also affected by various long-term structural changes in our society. Population aging is creating additional demands on the pension. health and long-term care systems at the same time when governments are looking for ways to cut public spending. Globalization makes capital and labor more mobile. This makes raising fiscal revenue to pay for the social services and transfers more challenging. Skill-biased technical change destroys many medium-and low-skilled jobs and contributes to raising inequality. Family patterns are changing as well. bringing about new risks. All these trends and challenges point to a clear bottom line: the welfare state has to change.

We have created four civil war onset models using data from 1979-1999 (in sample). which we then use to predict the onset of civil war from 2000-2016 (out-of-sample). Our time horizon is one month into the future. The predictive performance of our best model as measured by its area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.859. All 24 conflict onsets between 2000-2016 occurred within countries in the top half of our risk ranking. with 83% of these onsets falling in the top 20% category. and 54% in the top 10% category.

Turku, Finland: Centrum Balticum Foundation",,,,Russia is often seen as an “energy superpower” that is eager to exploit energy vulnerability of its customers for geopolitical goals. However. behind this façade of energy strength there are some vulnerable spots. One of such spots is Kaliningrad Oblast (or province). 1 This is one of the smallest regions of the Russian Federation with a population of about 960 thousand people. What makes Kaliningrad special is its exclave location on the Baltic Sea coast2–it has no land connection to the rest of the Russian Federation but has common borders with two European Union (EU) member states–Poland (to the south) and Lithuania (to the north and east).Kaliningrad’s exclave location means that it is very much dependent on the transit of goods and people through Lithuania. There have been some frictions between Russia and Lithuania (and. more broadly. between Russia and the EU) on the Kaliningrad transit issue before. in particular. in 2002 during final stages of Lithuania’s preparation to join the EU. This year. however. the relations between Russia and the EU have deteriorated drastically. The EU along with the US and some other countries have imposed several rounds of economic sanctions against Russia because of Russia’s actions in Ukraine.

These include a review of the existing literature. analyses of survey data. analysis of Kurdistan regional and Iraqi national documents and laws. and a qualitative assessment of numerous conversations with government officials and private-sector employers. The KRG can develop its private sector by removing obstacles to starting or expanding a business. by identifying sectors for which conditions are particularly favorable for private-sector growth and supporting them. and by outsourcing and privatizing some functions that the KRG currently performs. However. private-sector growth does not guarantee that civil-service workers will leave for private-sector employment. Civil-service workers will need the qualifications necessary for private-sector jobs and will have to expect that the benefits of private-sector employment outweigh the benefits of civil-service employment. At the same time. as the KRG devises methods for encouraging civil-service workers to leave for the private sector. a key challenge will be to ensure that the most productive employees stay with the KRG in order to ensure the proper functioning of government.,True,I4TGZ1gAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6958030887733295054&hl=en&oi=scholarr,6958030887733295054,/scholar?cites=6958030887733295054,,,,0,0,0

Terrorists hit Europe’s capital in March. The British population voted for Brexit in June. Turkish armed forces failed to topple Erdoğan in July. A resurgent Russia flexed its military muscles again in the Middle East and actively interfered in American elections. in which the American population elected Trump. in November. We are worried but certainly not surprised by the volatility of contemporary international relations. In previous editions of our contribution to the Dutch government’s Strategic Monitor. we already observed a surge in assertive behavior. noted a dangerous uptick in crises. and warned for the contagiousness of political violence. The current volatility is not a coincidence. but rather the result of fundamental disturbances of the global order that are greatly amplified by rapid technological developments. Most mainstream explanations of recent turbulence focus on power transitions (the decline of the West and the rise of the rest). the concomitant return to more aggressive forms of power politics. and a backlash against globalization. What strikes us is that many of the explanations ignore what we consider one of the most striking mega trends that is reshaping the dynamics of power: the ongoing process of disintermediation. The StratMon 2016-2017 analyzes global trends in confrontation. cooperation and conflict based on different datasets. This year the report also contains case studies on Turkey.

The appearance of a flame in the ORZ is an important flame macrostructure transition that was previously shown to be associated with the onset of thermo-acoustic instability under acoustically coupled conditions. We find that. when similar bulk flow conditions are imposed in the ORZ. the transition is governed by the extinction strain rate and can occur at different adiabatic flame temperature and unstretched laminar burning velocity. First. we show that an important non-dimensional parameter characterizing the flow in the ORZ. that is the Strouhal number associated with the azimuthal ORZ spinning frequency. is independent of the Reynolds number and has the same constant value in air and oxy-combustion (S t= f O R Z.

1330083,Dynamics. stability and scaling of turbulent methane oxy-combustion,2018,Nadim Walid Chakroun,,,,,,Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an important strategy for reducing CO₂ emissions. with oxy-fuel combustion being one of the most promising technologies because of it is high efficiency and low cost. In oxy-combustion. CH₄/O₂/CO₂ mixtures burn at low temperatures (~~1700 K). high pressures (~~40 bar). where laminar burning velocities are about 7 times lower than in traditional CH₄ /Air mixtures. Thus oxy-fuel combustors are more prone to blowoff and dynamic instabilities. In this thesis we examine turbulent oxy-combustion flame stabilization physics at the large and small scales using experimental studies and numerical simulations. Experimental measurements are used to establish the stability characteristics of flame macrostructures in a swirl stabilized combustor. We show that the transition in the flame macrostructure to a flame stabilized along both the inner and outer shear layers (Flame IV). scales according to the extinction strain rate. similar to air flames. To achieve accurate scaling. extinction strain rates must be computed at the thermal conditions of the outer shear layer. emphasizing the role of heat interactions with the wall boundary layer. Care must be exercised while modeling the chemical structure of oxy-flames. We show that the kinetics of CO₂ (used as a diluent in oxy-combustion) is important in determining the consumption speed and flame extinction strain rate.

The flame structure. location of its leading edge away from the step. and primary recirculation zone are generally in better agreement with the experimental data when using the detailed mechanisms.

1330090,Techno-economic analysis of sour gas oxy-fuel combustion power cycles for carbon capture and sequestration,2014,Nadim Walid Chakroun,,,,,,The world's growing energy demand coupled with the problem of global warming have led us to investigate new energy sources that can be utilized in a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions than traditional fossil fuel power plants. One of these unconventional fuels is sour gas. Sour gas consists of mainly methane. containing large concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. Over 30% of the world's natural gas reserves are considered sour. However this unusual fuel poses many challenges due to the toxic and corrosive nature of the combustion products. One of the most promising technologies for carbon capture and sequestration is oxy-fuel combustion. This involves separating the nitrogen from air prior to the combustion itself. Then. after combustion. we separate the water and other substances and can use the resulting carbon dioxide stream for enhanced oil recovery representing an added economic benefit of this system. Firing temperatures for pure oxygen combustion can reach values up to 2500° C. which is well above what the combustor can handle. Therefore a diluent has to be added to reduce the temperature back to appropriate levels. but the key question is how this impacts the efficiency and performance of the entire cycle. Hence. if feasible. the use of sour gas in an oxy-fuel power plant could potentially allow us to harness the economic and environmental potential of this unconventional fuel. Depending on the cycle configuration. water or carbon dioxide can be used as diluents to control the flame temperature in the combustion process.

These disturbances can cause overloads or even contingencies of greater impact. In case of an extreme situation. load curtailment is considered the last resort for reducing the contingency impact. its activation being necessary to avoid the collapse of the system. However. load shedding systems seldom work optimally and cause either excessive or insufficient reduction of the load. To resolve this issue. the present paper proposes a methodology to enhance the load curtailment management in medium voltage distribution systems using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). This optimization seeks to minimize the amount of load to be cut off. Restrictions on the optimization problem consist of the security operation margins of both loading and voltage of the system elements. Heuristic optimization algorithms were chosen. since they are considered an online basis (allowing a short processing time) to solve the formulated load curtailment optimization problem. Best performances regarding optimal value and processing time were obtained using a PSO algorithm. qualifying the technique as the most appropriate for this study. To assess the methodology. the CIGRE MV distribution network benchmark was used. assuming dynamic load profiles during an entire week. Results show that it is possible to determine the optimal unattended power of the system. This way. improvements in the minimization of the expected energy not supplied (ENS) as well as the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIDI) at specific hours of the day were made.

These networks have technologies such as electric vehicle battery swapping stations that aim to economic welfare with own resources. Improper handling of electric vehicles services represents overload. congestion or surplus energy. This study addresses both management and support of electric vehiculos battery swapping stations. The formulation of a decision matrix examines economically viable alternatives that contributes to scheduling battery swapping stations. The decision matrix is implemented to manage the swapping. charging and discharging of electric vehicles. In addition. the smart microgrid model evaluates operation issues. The smart microgrid model used extends with considerations of demand response. generators with renewable energies. the wholesale market. local market and electricity spot price for electric vehicles. Additionally. uncertainty issues related to the planning for the infrastructure of the electric vehicle battery swapping station. variability of electricity prices. weather conditions and load forecasting are used. Mentioned stakeholders must maximize their economic benefits optimizing their uncertain day-ahead resources. The proposed hybrid optimization algorithm supports aggregator decision making.

1330110,Schedule Optimization in a smart microgrid considering demand response constraints,2020,Julian Garcia-Guarin and David Alvarez and Arturo Bretas and Sergio Rivera,13,Energies,17,4567,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Smart microgrids (SMGs) may face energy rationing due to unavailability of energy resources. Demand response (DR) in SMGs is useful not only in emergencies. since load cuts might be planned with a reduction in consumption but also in normal operation. SMG energy resources include storage systems. dispatchable units. and resources with uncertainty. such as residential demand. renewable generation. electric vehicle traffic. and electricity markets. An aggregator can optimize the scheduling of these resources. however. load demand can completely curtail until being neglected to increase the profits. The DR function (DRF) is developed as a constraint of minimum size to supply the demand and contributes solving of the 0-1 knapsack problem (KP). which involves a combinatorial optimization. The 0-1 KP stores limited energy capacity and is successful in disconnecting loads. Both constraints. the 0-1 KP and DRF. are compared in the ranking index. load reduction percentage. and execution time. Both functions turn out to be very similar according to the performance of these indicators. unlike the ranking index. in which the DRF has better performance. The DRF reduces to 25% the minimum demand to avoid non-optimal situations. such as non-supplying the demand and has potential benefits. such as the elimination of finite combinations and easy implementation.,True,vQuRvskAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,2,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/17/4567,8721724378184709737,/scholar?cites=8721724378184709737,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/17/4567/pdf,0,0,0

The experiments have been carried out using a laboratory scale experimental facility that has been set-up in the Heat Power Laboratory of Jadavpur University. The experiments are carried out for two different initial steam pressure (2 and 3 bar) conditions and a pressure difference ranging from 1 to 3 bar between the water and steam sections. The pressure and temperature data are recorded at different salient locations within the test section. Temporal changes in temperature give an indication of water-front propagation within the test section. Observation reveals that no distinct pressure peak occurs when the pressure difference remains lowest. irrespective of the initial steam pressure within the test section.

This is achieved using a multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that is implemented in the framework of the commercial CFD platform ANSYS FLUENT. The model is extensively validated with available experimental data on two different aspects: pressure drop in two-phase flow through porous media and prediction of dryout in typical porous debris beds. A wide range of system pressure. relevant to severe accident conditions. is considered in this analysis in order to obtain a thorough understanding of its impact on multiphase flow and dryout occurrence in porous debris beds.

Heatlines and Nusselt number. streamlines. and entropy generation are used for the analysis of heat transfer. flow circulation. and irreversibility production in the enclosure. The study reveals that the presence of an adiabatic block affects the heat transfer process severely. and three different zones of heat transfer are identified. These are namely the zone of heat transfer augmentation. the zone of heat transfer augmentation along with entropy generation reduction. and the zone of both heat transfer and entropy generation reduction. It is also found that the presence of an adiabatic block can enhance heat transfer up to a certain critical block size; thereafter. further increasing in block size reduces the heat transfer rate. An optimal block size where the heat transfer enhancement is maximum is observed to be smaller than the critical block size. The study demonstrates the analyses of heat transfer and entropy generation for a better thermal design of a system.

The molten state of core retained within the reactor vessel is typically an in-vessel accident scenario. The ex-vessel phenomenon. on the other hand. is a likely scenario following the failure of reactor pressure vessel. with more fragmented particles forming a heat generating debris at containment floor. The formation of such fragmented debris is a possible outcome of a hydrodynamic and thermal jet breakup that takes place during molten fuel coolant interaction (MFCI) at much later stage of accident sequence.

Existe atualmente maior atenção na metodologia de balanço de pH. Esta metodologia apresenta duas etapas: 1) extração do Mg da rocha silicato (pH ácido) e 2) carbonatação de CO2 (pH básico). No intuito de melhorar a eficiência da primeira etapa. processos de lixiviação são utilizados. Para isto é comumente empregado dois tipos de ácido (HCl e NH4HSO4). O problema do uso de NH4HSO4 é a sua recuperação devido ao grande consumo energético requerido na vaporização da água utilizada. O intuito do trabalho foi reduzir o consumo de água na “etapa de extração”. Para isto foi incrementada a concentração de NH4HSO4 nas soluções. No entanto. para avaliar a eficiência da extração de Mg mediante os processos de lixiviação. utilizou-se a metodologia Taguchi. Para avaliação dos resíduos obtidos após o processo de lixiviação. ensaios termogravimétricos (TG/DTG) foram utilizados.

This has led to problems and environmental impacts that motivate the use of clean and renewable energy sources and unconventional combustion processes. Biomass is a renewable source and has great potential for CO2 neutral energy generation. Among all the alternatives for the use of biomass. thermochemical conversion processes are the most efficient. and pyrolysis is the process capable of producing biofuels. minimizing dependence on fossil fuels. The most studied types of pyrolysis are: rapid pyrolysis and slow pyrolysis. The slow pyrolysis of biomass is mainly intended to produce biochar; however. a fraction of bio-oil is obtained. which presents a high content of oxygenated components. receiving less attention being discarded as residue. Several studies have highlighted the use of catalysts to improve biochar and bio-oil quality. However. it is noteworthy that the literature presents few studies regarding the effect of the use of catalysts in the slow pyrolysis of biomass. In Brazil. sugarcane is an important energy crop used for ethanol production. thereby. large quantities of sugarcane bagasse are generated. Nowadays there are many alternatives for use this resource. one of them is pyrolysis.

In recent decades. the world market for GT has severely decreased due to a number of reasons such as the war between Iran and Iraq and the approval of xanthan gum for the food industry with the advantage of low price and constant quality. In recent years. owing to desirable properties and advantage of the use of GT in medicine. research on biomedical applications of this gum continues to grow significantly. In this study. along with a report on the properties of GT. the research on the new applications of this gum in biomedical fields are reviewed.

F. Cl. Br). which are rather experimentally hard to find. Placing the same linkage between the local closed-shell singlet silylene (s2p 0) and the local triplet nitrene (p 1p 1) gives triplet minima which are 44-61 kcal/mol more stable than their corresponding quintets. The singlet states are approached through connecting triplet states of silylene and nitrene with the opposite spin electrons. Triplet states identified as ground states. while all singlet. triplet. and quintet states of (nitrenoethynyl)halosilylene species are minimal in their corresponding potential energy surface (PES).

Rather than consider these resentments separately. this article interrogates their relationship through the concept of petro-masculinity. which appreciates the historic role of fossil fuel systems in buttressing white patriarchal rule. Petro-masculinity is helpful to understanding how the anxieties aroused by the Anthropocene can augment desires for authoritarianism. The concept of petro-masculinity suggests that fossil fuels mean more than profit; fossil fuels also contribute to making identities. which poses risks for post-carbon energy politics. Moreover. through a psycho-political reading of authoritarianism.

1330200,The Birth of Energy,2019,Cara New Daggett,,,,280,Duke University Press,In The Birth of Energy Cara New Daggett traces the genealogy of contemporary notions of energy back to the nineteenth-century science of thermodynamics to challenge the underlying logic that informs today's uses of energy. These early resource-based concepts of power first emerged during the Industrial Revolution and were tightly bound to Western capitalist domination and the politics of industrialized work. As Daggett shows. thermodynamics was deployed as an imperial science to govern fossil fuel use. labor. and colonial expansion. in part through a hierarchical ordering of humans and nonhumans. By systematically excavating the historical connection between energy and work. Daggett argues that only by transforming the politics of work—most notably. the veneration of waged work—will we be able to confront the Anthropocene's energy problem. Substituting one source of energy for another will not ensure a habitable planet; rather. the concepts of energy and work themselves must be decoupled.,True,Tv5IUp8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,39,https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/24047,5924631362772357265,/scholar?cites=5924631362772357265,,,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/24047/9781478090007-web.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Drawing on queer phenomenology. I show how militarized masculinities function as spatiotemporal landmarks that give killing in war its “orientation” and make it morally intelligible. These bearings no longer make sense for drone warfare. which radically deviates from two of its main axes: the home–combat and distance–intimacy binaries. Through a narrative methodology. I show how descriptions of drone warfare are rife with symptoms of an unresolved disorientation. often expressed as gender anxiety over the failure of the distance–intimacy and home–combat axes to orient killing with drones. The resulting vertigo sparks a frenzy of reorientation attempts. but disorientation can lead in multiple and sometimes surprising directions – including. but not exclusively. more violent ones.

As numerous scholars have argued. an energy transition away from – rather than in addition to – fossil fuels will require more than technology and financial capital. Here we argue that a feminist perspective on energy provides an important framework for understanding what keeps us stuck in unsustainable energy cultures. as well as a paradigm for designing truly just energy systems. Feminist approaches have been widely taken up in environmental and ecofeminist work. as well as in climate change research. In energy studies. however. gender-related research has tended to focus more narrowly on women's issues.

It occupies the imagination as a set of circumstances that counterpose individual human actors against ungraspable scales and impossible odds. There is much at stake in how we understand the implications of this planetary imagination. and how to plot paths from this present to other less troubling futures. With Anthropocene Unseen: A Lexicon. the editors aim at a resource helpful for this task: a catalog of ways to pluralize and radicalize our picture of the Anthropocene. to make it speak more effectively to a wider range of contemporary human societies and circumstances. Organized as a lexicon for troubled times. each entry in this book recognizes the gravity of the global forecasts that invest the present with its widespread air of crisis. urgency. and apocalyptic possibility. Each also finds value in smaller scales of analysis. capturing the magnitude of an epoch in the unique resonances afforded by a single word.  The Holocene may have been the age in which we learned our letters. but we are faced now with circumstances that demand more experimental plasticity. Alternative ways of perceiving a moment can bring a halt to habitual action. opening a space for slantwise movements through the shock of the unexpected.

The dominant. ‘fossil’ myth of energy. depoliticizes the forward march of energy intensity over human history. Instead. we need energy stories that more fully account for the role of political domination in major energy transitions of the past. Fossil domination is historically unique in its marriage of racial capitalism and imperialism. but it may also reflect broader patterns of fuel transition. I draw upon recent research on two momentous energy transitions – the rise of grain states and fossil fuel empires – that show how political innovations in labor extraction and domination were the main catalysts for transition. rather than superior fuel technologies or a public thirst for more energy. Emphasizing the role of domination across energy history disrupts the fossil myth. while also making space for more transformative energy …,True,Tv5IUp8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2020.1807204,4755211899014279661,/scholar?cites=4755211899014279661,,,,0,0,0
1330207,Energy's Power: Fuel. Work. and Waste in the Politics of the Anthropocene,2016,Cara Daggett,,,,,,This project curates a genealogy of energy. treating energy as a historical entity that is generated through the interplay of bodies. machines and fuels. Energy is often understood to be transhistoric. but a genealogical approach appreciates energy as a thing of the Anthropocene. emerging only through experiments with steam engines. In following the emergence of energy. this study focuses upon thermodynamics. the science that ‘discovered’ energy in the mid-19th century. and traces its early manifestations in global politics through the mid-20th century. a period I refer to as a prelude to the Anthropocene. when humans began to glimpse the frightening effects of industrialization.  The first chapters analyze the ethical legacy of thermodynamics. Many early energy scientists were devout Scottish Presbyterians. and energy offered a scientific mode for reconciling Christianity to an industrializing Earth. Energy science could be applied to reinforce an already dominant Protestant work ethic. showing its continued relevance to an urban-industrial system of waged work. The remaining chapters then examine the global political effects of thermodynamics and the energy-work connection. Thermodynamics has received less attention than those of the contemporaneous sciences of evolution and ecology. even though thermodynamic assumptions girded evolutionary and ecological thinking. I therefore interrogate thermodynamics itself as an imperial science. In British new imperialism. energy functioned at the intersection of gender. race and class. contributing to the coding of people – and things – as workers and wasters to be governed by imperial powers …,True,Tv5IUp8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/44632,12061175635664260804,/scholar?cites=12061175635664260804,,,https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/44632/DAGGETT-DISSERTATION-2016.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

A combination of electronic and hydraulic systems is widely used since it combines the advantages of both. Hydraulic systems are widely spread because of their properties as accuracy. flexibility. high horsepower-to-weight ratio. fast starting. stopping and reversal with smoothness and precision. and simplicity of operations. On the other hand. the modern control of hydraulic systems is based on control of the circuit fed to the inductive solenoid that controls the position of the hydraulic valve.

Exergetic. energetic. economic and environmental analyses are carried out for a particular type of CSP plants. The study. although it aims a particular type of CSP plant–50 MW parabolic trough-CSP plant. it is sufficiently general to be applied to other configurations. The novelty of the study. in addition to modeling and analyzing the selected configuration. lies in the use of a state-of-the-art exergetic analysis combined with the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The modeling and simulation of the plant is carried out in chapter three and they are conducted into two parts. namely: power cycle and solar field. The computer model developed for the analysis of the plant is based on algebraic equations describing the power cycle and the solar field. The model was solved using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software; and is designed to define the properties at each state point of the plant and then. sequentially. to determine energy. efficiency and irreversibility for each component. The developed model has the potential of using in the preliminary design of CSPs and. in particular. for the configuration of the solar field based on existing commercial plants.

However. users' perception of comfort is severely affected by sudden changes in temperature outside the desired temperature. The instability of the water temperature with overshoots and undershoots is the most common disadvantage. which occurs mainly due to sudden changes in the water flow requested by users and the response delays inherent to the heating system.

1330220,Adaptive predictive control strategies of tankless hot water production,,Ismael Ehtiwesh and André Quintã and Jorge Ferreira,,,,,,Universally. a domestic potable water heating contributes between 15% and 40% of energy consumed within residential dwellings [1]. Among all trading technologies available. Gas Tankless Water Heaters (TGWH) are sold in large numbers and seen as an efficient means of domestic hot water production with a far smaller carbon [1]. However. its users comfort perception is severely affected by sudden water temperature changes away from the desired temperature [2]. The instability of the water production temperature with overshoots or undershoots is the most common drawback of gas tankless water heaters devices. This is mainly due to sudden changes on the overall water flow rate demand and the response delays inherent to the heating system. which can’t be anticipated by the conventional embedded controllers [2]. Several advanced TGWH devices use a gas modulation. feedback flow rate. temperature sensors and PID controllers [3]. Furthermore. the studies [4] and [5] report that the most promise alternative solution is the model predictive control (MPC) for instantaneous electric water heaters. In addition. due to the dominant nonlinear dynamics in TGWH behavior. feedback control design becomes more difficult and then leads to performance drops [6]. Therefore. an adaptive predictive control strategy. technique that has attracted attention nowadays. was used in this research work combined with a TGWH dynamic model.

In the first part. the transient behavior of a reference EWS. for which no PCMs was considered by resorting to the TRNSYS software. The second part addressed the incorporation of PCMs into the reference model by development of a full thermal dynamic numerical analysis. There is a considerable body of literature addressing the issue of modeling the behavior of PCMs at latent heat storage media within fluid heat tanks. particularly for residential EWS solar systems’ applications restoring to the TRNSYS software. Some studies [1. 2] have been conducted an experimental solar pilot plant to test the PCMs behavior in real conditions employing granular PCM–graphite compound. Stratification effects were taken into account and the simulation was conducted with TRNSYS. The studies reported that adding a PCM module would give the system a higher storage density while compensating for the heat loss in the top layer [3].

This research is about using mixed Calophyllum inophyllum-palm oil biodiesel production and evaluation that biodiesel in a diesel engine. The Calophyllum inophyllum–palm oil methyl ester (CPME) is processed using the following procedure:(1) the crude Calophyllum inophyllum and palm oils are mixed at the same ratio of 50: 50 volume%.(2) degumming.(3) acid-catalysed esterification.(4) purification. and (5) alkaline-catalysed transesterification. The results are indeed encouraging which satisfy the international standards. CPME shows the high heating value (37.9 MJ/kg) but lower kinematic viscosity (4.50 mm 2/s) due to change the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition compared to Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester (CIME). The average results show that the blended fuels have higher Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and NO x emissions. lower Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE). along with CO and HC emissions than diesel fuel over the entire range of speeds. Among the blends. CPME5 offered better performance compared to other fuels.

The innovative gasification reactor aims to yield a high-quality product gas as it conducts pyrolysis. combustion. and reduction in different zones. In addition. it uses gas as a heat carrier and has a fluidized char bed in the reduction zone to enhance the in-situ tar reduction. In order to study the feasibility of the gasifier. an evaluation of the product gas and the process efficiency is required. The proposed model was based on the reaction rates and hydrodynamic parameters of the bubbling bed. Four different stages were initially considered in the simulation process: decomposition of the feed. partial volatile combustion. char reduction. and gas solid separation. The gasification reactor was operated over a temperature range of 800–1000 C and an isothermal combustion reactor was operated at 1000 C. In addition. the air to biomass mass ratio was varied from 0.2 to 0.5. It has been validated and displayed very good agreement with published data. Effects of gasification reactor temperature. air to biomass ratio. and gasifier dimensions on the composition of product gas were investigated Results showed that the principal component is CO and its concentration in the product gas increases with increase in gasifier temperature but decreases with increasing air to biomass ratio. The results also gave a relatively high value of the lowered gas caloric value and acceptable cold gas efficiency which help the sizing of gasifiers and the choice of optimal operating conditions.

The thermodynamic properties (standard enthalpy Δ soln H. standard entropy Δ soln S. and standard Gibbs energy of solution Δ soln G) were computed using the generated solubility data via van’t Hoff and Gibbs equations. The dissolution process of amygdalin is endothermic and the driving mechanism in all mixtures is entropy. Maximal solubility was achieved in 0.4 mole fraction of ethanol at 328.15 K and the minimal one in neat ethanol at 293.15 K. Van’t Hoff. Jouyban–Acree–van’t Hoff. and Buchowski–Ksiazczak models were used to simulate the obtained solubility data. The calculated solubilities deviate reasonably from experimental data. Preferential solvation parameters of amygdalin in mixture solvents were analyzed using the inverse Kirkwood–Buff integrals (IKBI) method.

1330271,Transient analysis of the cooling process of molten salt thermal storage tanks due to standby heat loss,2015,Christian Suárez and Alfredo Iranzo and FJ Pino and J Guerra,142,Applied Energy,,56-65,Elsevier,Molten salts consisting of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate have been used successfully as a thermal energy collection and storage fluid in different solar thermal plants. However. the relatively high melting point of this mixture (221 °C) represents an important risk of local solidification in the operation of the solar power plants during standby periods. In this work. a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed to analyze the cooling process of representative state-of-the-art molten salt thermal storage tanks during these standby periods. A comprehensive set of operating conditions is analyzed. covering both hot and cold storage tanks. charging levels. and heat losses. Results show that the onset of local crystallization is highly influenced by the tank charging level.

This paper analyses the choice between diesel or dual engines jointly and considers the alternatives of installing or not installing a sulphur scrubber when building a new vessel. The dual engine is more flexible because it can consume liquefied natural gas (LNG) as other marine fuels but the initial investment is more expensive.

This trend can be reinforced if the installed power capacity of nuclear and coal plants is considerably decreased.

World maritime transport fleet is increasing in amount and in size of vessels and. accordingly. marine fuel oil consumption is also increasing. The marine fuel oil consumption represents the 50% of the operational costs of a vessel and it has a huge environmental impact (ocean acidification. pollution. greenhouse effect. climate change…). Consequently. IMO (International Maritime Organization) created a specific environmental regulation and divided the ocean in different ECA zones (Emission Control Areas). The present work analyses the best strategy. a shipowner should adopt. to comply with ECA regulations. in three different panoramas: i) using an active vessel. placing a scrubber or consuming low sulphur marine fuel oil; ii) constructing a new vessel. choosing between marine dual engine or marine diesel mengine in both cases with or without scrubber; and iii) in case new ECA zones are created. which affects directly the vessel’s operational area.; Gaur egun. itsas garraioak munduko ondasunen % 90 mugitzen du.

In order to carry out a precise measurement with optical techniques. it is necessary to avoid reflections produced by the light falling on the metal part. For this. it is necessary to cover it with matte powder. The coating operation is. normally carried out manually by spraying the powder onto the work-piece. In particular. a spray with magnesium oxide powder has been used. achieving a thin and uniform fairly layer.In general. the aim of this article is to evaluate the possibility of controlling the manufacturing tolerances achieved in machining processes by means of optical techniques.

It proves the importance of a fruitful discussion between peers. It is a sample of methodological change with no curricular change. It also shows the overall satisfaction of the students. who achieved an equal or better academic performance than the students in the traditional learning environment. At the Faculty of Engineering in Bilbao. Engineering Graphics is a collegiate subject and it is assessed using a final exam. In the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 academic years. didactic interventions were carried out. introducing active methodologies in the experimental group. keeping the same content and evaluation as the control group. It is important to mention that the subject of Engineering Graphics is taught in large groups and with novel students of first course of engineering. A cooperative dynamic (jigsaw) was selected. The main feature of this method is that the students’ knowledge is developed by themselves and the teacher does not explain any theory and practice linked to the subject. The teacher advises students in their learning process. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data collected shows that the use of a cooperative dynamic has a positive effect on the learning process of the students.,True,_ZwsvYQAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,http://www.edgj.org/index.php/EDGJ/article/view/718,,,,,http://www.edgj.org/index.php/EDGJ/article/download/718/490,0,0,0

Cham,The reuse of damaged stamps or forgingc dies is a key aspect of the forging process. Whenever a forging die must be repaired the damaged zones are filled with welding material to be later machined. In this process. some phases can be optimized as the amount of welding material and moreover the machining tool paths and parameters. With the introduction of new digitization technologies new possibilities in the automatization of the machining are arisen. Thanks to the application of reverse engineering techniques. good and smoothed contours are extracted from the digitized geometry. The machining phase based on the obtained contours is considerably reduced in time and it does not involve any significant problem. The obtaining of these contours is the most complicated step of the proposed methodology. Some tests with diverse forging dies and mixed contours have been performed. The operations …,True,_ZwsvYQAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45781-9_81,,,,,,0,0,0

The payment level acts as a floor basis for the PHS operator during the decision-making process to contract fixed payments for wind support or to act market-free on other market segments. through price arbitrage and reserve provision. The market share required for the efficient operation of a PHS facility and the levels of feed-in tariff (FIT) are set mathematically.

Research connected to security of supply. ie. having reliable power capacities to meet demand. has been conducted by transmission system operators. Some of the common parameters of security of supply are loss of load probability (LOLP) and/or loss of load expectation (LOLE). which are calculated by a special algorithm. These parameters are specific for each power system. This work presents the way of calculating LOLP as well as the optimization algorithm of LOLP. which takes into consideration the particularities of the power system. It also presents a difference in the treatment of LOLP regarding the observed power system and the necessary installed power capacity if applied to the calculated LOLP in relation to the optimized LOLP. As a conclusion. the study analyzed the parameters impact the regional electricity market—where the participants are countries with different development levels and various particularities of power systems—ie. what it means when the same LOLP criterion is applied to them and the optimized LOLP.

1330315,Planiranje izgradnje elektrana u okružju otvorenog tržišta električnom energijom,2003,Mladen Zeljko,,,,,,Otpočinjanjem procesa deregulacije u elektroenergetskom sektoru filozofija planiranja izgradnje elektrana se bitno mijenja. Promjene se odnose na samu metodologiju. modele koji se primjenjuju. kao i na nositelje odgovornosti u procesu planiranja. U tradicionalnom načinu planiranja osnovni kriterij je bio kriterij minimalnog troška (engl. least cost). Dok se u vremenu prije otvaranja tržišta nije trebalo razmišljati o sigurnosti ulaganja u izgradnju novih elektrana. jer je tržište bilo osigurano. u novim. tržišnim. uvjetima jedan od ključnih problema je rizik povrata investicije. Elektroprivredna poduzeća nisu više «; zatvorena»; unutar državnih granica. već je na sceni trgovanje električnom energijom na vrlo širokom prostoru. U takvoj bespoštednoj borbi oni koji su učinkovitiji i oni koji imaju jeftiniju energetsku osnovu osiguravaju za sebe bolju poziciju na tržištu. Nametnulo se. kao nužnost. preispitivanje metoda i modela zasnovanih na kriteriju minimalnog troška.

1330316,A Solution for Electricity market Opening in Croatia-Mixed SB/TPA Model,,Mario Tot and Mladen Zeljko and Marko Aunedi,,Proceedings of 1st Balkan Power Conference,,112-117,,The paper describes Croatian power system in general. interconnections to neighbouring power systems and possible development of future electricity market in Croatia. A proposed scheme for restructuring and liberalisation of Croatian power sector is a gradual transition from mixed SB/TPA model to a totally open market and its integration in the European electricity market. The first step is to introduce SB model for captive customers. and TPA for eligible customers. which will be allowed to enter into bilateral contracts with producers and to pay for the use of transmission system. The imbalances. which are normally expected. can be settled through separate balancing market. The proposed interim market is very important &# 8211;;; it allows TPA model to grow and to become stable during time.

Although WASP has been used by power system planners around the world for many decades. its standard formulation does not allow the user to explicitly model many situations that can occur in realistic power systems. Examples of such situations include dual-fuel plants. options for electricity exports. energy exchange agreements with neighboring systems. and considering large generating units as candidates in relatively small-size systems. A number of alternative modeling solutions are proposed in the paper based on the authors’ long-term experience in carrying out generation expansion studies for electricity systems of various types and sizes. These solutions demonstrate the flexibility of using WASP to model atypical features of power systems.

1330322,Does the energy sector call for reform?,2007,Goran Granic and Damir Pesut and Nada Jandrilovic and Branka Jelavic and Mladen Zeljko,,,,,,This paper discusses the course of the energy sector reforms in Europe so far. its objectives. achievements. issues. and dilemmas. In particular. long term and security aspects of energy supply of Europe are analyzed. In addition to the legislative changes regarding the open energy market regulation. and primarily the changes concerning electricity and natural gas markets. the past period saw dynamic changes of institutional framework. such as: increasing members of the european Union. increased number of countries aspiring to the EU (candidate countries or potential candidates). and changes in other European countries out of which Russia is the most significant energy producer. The paper analyzes the issue of responsibility between state - regulator - system operator - trader - energy buyer. In Europe. it is more a complex question because the system of responsibility includes the institution of the European Union. Therefore. the relations between EU - state - regulator - system operator - trader - energy buyer are especially important. The paper looks in to the issue of energy company integrations. creation of energy mega-undertakings and their influence on further market development. The question of monopolies now appears in a new form. The conclusions suggest possible measures for institutional influence on energy market development. especially in the network energy systems. which may have a positive impact on system security and stability and markets development and their long term sustainability.

Eligibility is understood as a possible supplier choice. To ensure the eligible status. annual demand should exceed 40 GWh. The category of customers that has gained the eligibility status based on the Law on Electricity Market makes out a total of around 7 percent of the annual electric energy consumption in Croatia. Thus. it can be said that electricity market openness in Croatia lies somewhat below 10 percent. According to the already mentioned Article 23. paragraph 4. the Government may determine annual demand threshold lowering as a condition to grant the eligibility status. According to the Law on Gas Market from 2001. the category of eligible gas customers in Croatia includes all electricity generators who use gas. regardless of the annual gas consumption. and other customers whose annual consumption exceeds 100 million m3. In 2002 there were seven such customers and they participated with 1.374.160.000 m3. ie 51 percent in the total gas consumption. As INA is the sole natural gas producer in Croatia with a long-term contract on the supply line lease for the transportation of Russian gas. it is also the only supplier of natural gas. Therefore. in 2002 each eligible customer bought gas from INA. Issues related to this field are: what kind of dynamics should one proceed with toward further energy market opening in Croatia?

However there are three main hurdles to the commercialisation of this promising technology; one of which is reliability. Current standards require an automotive fuel cell to last around 5000 h of operation (equivalent to around 150.000 miles). which has proven difficult to achieve to date. This hurdle can be overcome through in-depth reliability analysis including techniques such as Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) amongst others.

The chemical nature and structure of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) plays a large part in this and is affected by the extent to which is mechanically compressed. Here. X-ray computed tomography shows the effect of cell compression on the MEA. and how it differs under the land and channel regions.

1330349,Taking Stock of the Political Economy of Power Sector Reforms in Developing Countries,2018,Alan David Lee and Zainab Usman,,,,,World Bank. Washington. DC,The power sector reform experiences of             developing countries vary greatly. To help explain this from             a political economy perspective. this paper reviews several             dozen statistical analyses. multi-country case studies. and             development practice publications. The frame of reference is             the model of market-oriented reforms that became a global             norm in the 1990s. Findings are organized in terms of the             history. theory. motives. processes and outcomes of reforms.             Market orientation emerged around the 1980s as part of a             shift in economic theory and policy away from state control.             and was expected to improve efficiency and investments.             Reform advocates never took political economy issues into             full consideration. Yet. policy makers have had             sociopolitical as well as technical motives for reform. such             as crisis response. International norms and competition for             foreign investment and trade pulled governments to model             reforms. while development partners pushed them as a             condition of aid. Reform implementation has been             characterized by strong tensions among different public and             private interests. Concretely. 1990s model reforms were             based on a logic of depoliticizing pricing and investment             decisions; often placing policy makers in a conflict of             interest situation. Thus. the political costs and risks of             reform have often exceeded the benefits perceived by local             decision makers. especially as reforms did not generally             result in immediate benefits for citizens.

1330354,The political economy of economic diversification in Nigeria,2017,Zainab Usman,,,,,,As Africa’s largest economy and its most populous country. over a decade of rapid economic growth in Nigeria contributed to the 'Africa Rising' narrative. However. like many African commodity exporters. this economic growth. billions of dollars in oil earnings and electoral democracy have not translated into a diversified and industrial economy. This study examines why the Nigerian economy remains so dependent on oil and is non-industrial. which I argue are economic and development outcomes of specific policy choices constrained by Nigeria’s institutional configuration or the political settlement. In this endeavour. my central preoccupation is with the political processes of decision making which at any point in time favour one policy choice over the other in resource-rich and plural societies such as Nigeria. and the economic and development outcomes of these policy choices. I employ the political settlements analytical framework to unveil these political processes and the conditions they create in which certain policies are preferred over others. This entails an examination of the causal relationship within the three variables of 'constraints'. 'policies' and 'economic and development outcomes'. I argue that understanding Nigeria's challenges of economic diversification requires an examination of its political settlement to identify horizontal (elite competition). vertical (societal agitations for resource redistribution) and external (oil shocks) constraints on a ruling coalition. and the specific economic policy responses each constraint generates.

Seismically imaged opal‐A (biogenic silica) to opal‐CT (cristobalite and tridymite) diagenetic boundaries from two regions offshore of Norway have developed regular wavelength patterns. The pattern consists of cell‐shaped elevations that are 200–2600 m wide and up to 200 m high. separated by troughs. The cells represent regions that undergo diagenesis at shallower burial depths. earlier than adjacent areas. The chemical change leads to mechanical compaction and porosity reduction; therefore subsidence occurs above the cells in the overburden.

Three-dimensional seismic data from polygonal fault arrays from offshore Norway are used to develop a new process model for polygonal fault development. We propose that in siliceous sediment. polygonal fault arrays can be triggered thermally. due to the conversion of opal-A to opal-CT at depths of 100–1000 m. This conversion causes differential compaction and shear failure and therefore fault initiation. The location of the earliest faults is dependent on where opal-A to opal-CT conversion and compaction occur first.

Furthermore. we deduce that the chemistry of formation water expelled transiently through the polygonal faults must have played a key role in their formation.

On the flanks of a large structural high. faults also strike perpendicular to the slope direction. displaying a concentric pattern. Faults that show preferential alignment are located in areas with increased bedding dip. and most aligned faults are antithetic to the bedding dip.

1330362,3-D seismic investigation of the diagenesis and deformation of Cenozoic siliceous sediments on the Eastern Atlantic Margin,2011,Mark T. Ireland,,,,,,Three-dimensional seismic data from the East Atlantic Margin are used to investigate the diagenesis and deformation of siliceous sediments. Three themes were tackled.  At the Gjallar Ridge. offshore Norway. seismic and well data indicate that diagenesis of siliceous sediments occurs across a zone ~300 m thick. At the top of the zone circular regions. with relief of ~200 m. are interpreted as regions of preferential diagenesis.  Below these. regions with a similar size and distribution are attributed to the same cause.  The chemistry of formation water expelled transiently through polygonal faults may play a role in their formation. This is the first recognition from seismic data that silica diagenetic transformation zones can be hundreds of metres thick and heterogeneous. as observed at outcrop previously.  On the Mauritanian continental margin layer-bound fault systems deform a probable siliceous succession. Where this succession mantles canyons the majority of faults strike perpendicular to the canyon axes due to increased bedding dip and most are antithetic to bedding dip. Where the bedding dip is greater than ~1°. synthetic faults dip more steeply than antithetic faults. which is the exact opposite that would be expected on a dipping margin. It is hypothesised that the layer hosting the faults has been subjected to simple shear of ~20° or more. rotating the fault planes.  Lastly at the Vema Dome. offshore Norway four submarine slides are identified in siliceous sediments. Each covers an area of ~30 km2. is up to 600 m thick. with an upper surface topography consisting of a series of arcuate ridges perpendicular to the dip of the slope.

The use of hydrogen as a replacement for natural gas is one proposed solution. where renewable hydrogen is either blended into the gas grid or used directly. To ensure continuity of supply large scale hydrogen storage will be needed to meet this demand.Hydrogen has been stored in small volumes (< 25GWh) in salt caverns at various locations onshore in the United Kingdom since 1959.

1330365,Influence of ductile substrates and layer thickness on the spacing and topology of layer bound fault systems,2020,Mark Ireland and Chris K Morley and Richard Davies,,,,,EarthArXiv,Polygonal fault systems are extraordinary features of many fine grained sedimentary succession and have been described from a significant number of deepwater sedimentary basins over the last two decades. Their formation represents an important mechanism by which fine grained sediments compact often resulting in a variety of complex patterns for which several controlling factors have been proposed. Here three-dimensional seismic data from the North West Shelf of Australia are used to interpret previously undescribed characteristic of a layer bound fault systems where systematic horst and graben structures are the dominant structural style. Conjugate fault pairs which form the horsts and grabens frequently have a systematic spacing with graben bounding faults exhibiting a spacing of half that of the horst bounding faults. It is interpreted that this systematic spacing of fault pairs indicates the presence of a ductile layer at the base of the fault system. Furthermore. using topological analysis areas with different patterns and contrasting fault interactions and intersections. are used to show that the growth of layer bound faults may not be explained by a single model of growth. The regular spacing and style of faults described indicate that the growth of layer bound fault systems are strongly influenced by both layer thickness and the ductility of underlying sediments. The findings have implications for the genesis and growth of layer bound fault systems.,True,QGpeT8kAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC,0,https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/1788/,,,,,https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/1788/download/3775/,0,0,0

The most common route for the extraction of these metals is a hydrometallurgical one in which the base metal oxides are dissolved in sulphuric acid and then concentrated further by solvent extraction. However. as many of these deposits are relatively low grade (ie 0.5-1.8% Co and 2-4% Cu) and can also contain large amounts of acid consuming gangue minerals (ie dolomitic. micaeous. and/or siliceous). the hydrometallurgical route becomes uneconomic due to the excessive acid leaching costs. Some means of preconcentration ahead of leaching is then desirable to improve the process economics. Apart from the small scale mining (Pan. Afr. News Agency. 2000) handpicking. although not easy. oxide concentration by flotation has been suggested. For the flotation process. the two most common approaches are controlled potential sulphidisation (CPS) and the fatty acid flotation method. The preferred method is dictated by the nature of the mineral makeup of the gangue. Being secondary deposits. the gangue associated with these ores is often complex and can play a significant role in the overall flotation efficiency. Laboratory flotation experience gained from the testing of a number of different ores of this type has revealed that it is not possible to prescribe a set method for the flotation of various ore types. Each ore needs to be analysed very carefully before and after laboratory flotation on an individual basis in order to arrive at an acceptable flotation techniqueLaboratory …,True,BsIK06cAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,5,http://saimm.org.za/Conferences/BM2005/191-200_Mulaba.pdf,17071107603402373757,/scholar?cites=17071107603402373757,,,http://saimm.org.za/Conferences/BM2005/191-200_Mulaba.pdf,0,0,0

A recently published report states that the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) currently spends over $4 million yearly to remove about 55.000 deer carcasses from its roadways. Currently. one of the most effective existing methods to reduce AVCs is the use of animal detection systems. which can detect animals near the roadway and alert approaching drivers accordingly.

This report details the steps taken to develop a prototype driver drowsiness monitoring system (DDMS). The first area of consideration was the basic design requirements that would pertain to all driver drowsiness monitors. such as the ideal functional specifications that designers and engineers would account for in the development of drowsy monitor designs. Next. the project reviewed salient driver-based and vehicle-based predictors of driver drowsiness based on a literature review and an analysis of data from two recent naturalistic commercial driving studies. The development of a prototype DDMS included the integration of a machine vision (MV) eye closure sensor and a MV lane position sensor. The operational performance of the prototype DDMS was assessed during a dynamic on-road evaluation under varying conditions of ambient illumination. eyewear. and skin complexion. This evaluation assessed the performance of the MV eye closure sensor. the MV lane position sensor. and the integrated prototype DDMS algorithms. The key finding of the on-road evaluation is that the multiple sensors integrated approach is necessary. The project provided seven recommendations to improve the operational performance of these sensors and topics for future DDMS development.

To reduce AVCs in the state. the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) in collaboration with the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI). proposed the evaluation of a microwave roadside animal detection system (ADS) in naturalistic conditions. To achieve this objective. a 300-meter-long buried dual-cable sensor system was installed and tested at a suitable location on the Virginia Smart Road where wild animals such as deer and bear. are often observed in a roadside environment. The buried sensor can detect the crossing of large and medium-sized animals when a generated electromagnetic detection field is perturbed and provides data on their location along the length of the cable. Target animals are sensed based on their electrical conductivity. size. and movement. with multiple simultaneous intrusions being detected during a crossing event. Data analyses indicated that the ADS. if properly installed and calibrated. is capable of detecting animals such as deer and bear with over 90% reliability. The ADS also performed well even when covered by 3 feet of snow and under various traffic conditions. showing no vehicle interferences during the same monitoring period.

1330405,Assessment of Roadway Surface Conditions Using On-Board Vehicle Sensors: Final Report. Phase I,2015,Cristian Druta and Andrew S Alden,,,FHWA-JPO-16-359,,,Real-time assessment of road surface conditions can be used to provide valuable safety information to travelers when roads are slippery (eg. contaminated roads. heavy rain. black ice. etc.). Identification of these hazardous surface conditions using onboard vehicle sensors will warn drivers to proceed with caution on compromised road sections. thus reducing the risks of crashes.

1330408,Evaluation of Transit Vehicle Brake Inspection through Ultrasonic Emissions Analysis,2020,Brian Hearing and Andrew Alden and Kevin Grove,,,,32,Transportation Research Board Transit IDEA Program,This research project explores a new approach for improving transit safety based on detecting problems with transit vehicle brakes by analyzing sounds emitted by braking events. Vehicle brakes emit acoustic energy as part of the friction process; the spectra of these sounds are highly dependent on the mechanical condition of the brake and can be used to detect problems. Acoustic theory indicates that as brake linings wear the resonant frequency of the shoe or pad increases. potentially enabling the monitoring of lining wear. To test this approach passive acoustic sensors were placed roadside at the exit of a transit bus facility for 9 months. The sensors collected almost 10.000 recordings of a bus fleet of 160 vehicles braking over a variety of conditions. Spectra of buses that had brake work performed during this period were analyzed to compare differences between new and old friction linings. It was found that the spectra changes as friction linings wear. agreeing with acoustic theory. where both the centroid and spread of resonant frequencies increased with wear. The use of this information in predictive maintenance was found to be promising; with a modest increase in the number of brake inspections resulting from the acoustic system the maximum time a problem could go undetected would be significantly shortened versus waiting for the next periodic inspection. The performance of this capability could be significantly improved with additional data.,True,yWjlcpUAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC,0,https://trid.trb.org/view/1751868,,,,,,0,0,0

1330410,Use of Onboard Vehicle Sensors to Assess Road Weather Conditions for Integration with Connected and Automated Vehicles,2018,Cristian Druta and Andrew Alden and Gabriel Guevara,,,18-05103,,,The use of vehicle native sensors to provide real-time identification of hazardous road surface conditions such as black ice would allow drivers to receive cautionary warnings on compromised road sections. thus reducing crash risks. The main objective of this study was to further investigate a previously proven tire microslip phenomenon based on relative rotational displacements of a driven and nondriven wheels. Data obtained from different vehicle platforms were analyzed to establish a correlation between variables collected by the onboard sensors and the roadway surface conditions under several driving scenarios (eg. different constant speeds and road grades. icy road surfaces. etc.). Additionally. a dimensionless tire-pavement interaction factor. Traction Index (TI). was developed as an indicator of road surface slipperiness and slope for various time lengths. The results of multiple test runs conducted on roads conditions ranging from dry to snowy to icy showed small but statistically discernable differences in the TI values. Changes in these observed values were clearly associated with transitions from dry to slippery pavement conditions. Lower TI values were always obtained for slick surfaces and uphill directions due to the increased relative rotational displacement for the driven versus nondriven wheels. Such information can be shared among vehicles through connected and automated vehicle technologies to warn travelers of adverse weather ahead or be applied to optimize winter road maintenance.,True,yWjlcpUAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC,0,https://trid.trb.org/view/1496583,,,,,,0,0,0

The project consisted of three key steps that led to a final road study: 1) conducting focus groups with light vehicle drivers and school bus drivers to determine what type of in-vehicle school-bus related information they would like to receive/send; 2) developing a concept of operations to accommodate driver desires; and 3) evaluating the effect of an in-vehicle message that warns of a stopped school bus ahead. In the road study. researchers evaluated each driver’s response through analysis of vehicle kinematics (speed. longitudinal acceleration. and jerk) when a bus was staged either beyond a “School Bus Stop Ahead” roadside sign or beyond the point at which a similar in-vehicle message was presented. Driver responses for each condition were compared to a baseline condition that described their driving behavior when no bus was present on the roadway. The results showed a nearly immediate response to in-vehicle messages. whereas the corresponding roadside sign messages provided little evidence of modifying driver behavior prior to visually observing a stopped school bus in the roadway.,True,yWjlcpUAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC,0,https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/36983,,,,,https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/36983/dot_36983_DS1.pdf,0,0,0

Introduction Japan has the ambitious target of reducing its total greenhouse gas emission to 26% of the 2013 level and increasing the ratio of electricity generated from renewable energy to the total electricity generation to 22%-24% by 2030 1) 2). Owing to the introduction of the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme for renewable energy in 2012. there has been a significant increase in the electric power produced from renewable energy sources in the country. such as biomass to replace or mix with coal. Co-firing technology. which involves the addition of some biomass to the coal used in coal-fired power plants. is a promising means of reducing greenhouse emissions from coal-fired power plant. especially considering its lower additional investment requirement compared with CO2 capture technology or oxyfuel technology 3). It has been implemented in several coal-fired power plants in Japan. although the biomass ratio in the country is still low. being< 3% 4). The introduction of biomass at high level in coal-fired power plants will contribute substantially to the achievement of government’s goal.Despite that biomasses generally have lower ash content compared to coal. they contain larger amounts of alkaline and alkali earth metals (AAEMs) and chlorine 5). This high AAEMs content may have an undesirable effect on the boiler operation during combustion. The interaction of AAEMs with the discrete coal minerals may reduce the melting point of the mineral particles. leading to severe ash deposition which reduces heat transfer and causes corrosion and erosion problems under the high-temperature boiler conditions 6)~ 9).

1330429,3-8-4 A novel method for milling and upgrading wet biomass chips,2017,Dedy Eka PRIYANTO and Shunichiro UENO and Kazuhiro KASAI,,,,124-125,The Japan Institute of Energy,Production of fine particles from biomass chips is usually performed using milling machines under drying condition that consume large amount of energy. To overcome these problems. we proposed a novel milling method by utilizing the thermal energy. so called self-steam (self-SE) explosion method. Different from conventional steam explosion method that directly supplies steam into reactor. self-SE method indirectly heat-up the reactor and utilizes the moisture content in biomass as steam resource. In this study. we focused on the possibility of our proposed method to produce fine particles with a size below 1 mm from wet wood chips. Sakura (Prunus spp. hardwood) chips with a size of 5-10 mm were used in this study. The effects of treatment conditions on the biomass size reduction were investigated in detail. The energy consumption of our proposed was also calculated and compared with that of the conventional mechanical mill (cutter mill). We found that self-SE method not only can effectively reduce the size of wood chips into fine particles (< 1mm). but also can improve the properties of product such as higher heating value and high hydrophobicity. Self-SE is also more energy-efficient than the conventional mill.,True,1kt-710AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jietaikaiyoushi/26/0/26_124/_article/-char/ja/,,,,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jietaikaiyoushi/26/0/26_124/_pdf,0,0,0

The low-molecular-weight fraction which was recovered as solid (termed soluble) was free from ash and moisture. had yield of 23.5–61.0 wt% on carbon basis. molecular weight of around 300. carbon content of as high as 81.5–84.8 wt% and oxygen content of as low as 6.5–12.1 wt%. In this work the combination of the proposed extraction method and liquefaction of the soluble under mild condition as a two-stage treatment method to produce liquid fuel was initially investigated. A lignite (LY) was extracted by the proposed extraction method. The solubles obtained were then liquefied at 380 and 400 oC by using FeO OH/sulfur as catalyst under the H2 pressure of as low as 2 MPa (at room temperature). The results showed that as high as 27.3% of carbon in the LY was converted as soluble by the extraction. 55.4 wt% of LY soluble was then converted as liquid fraction (oil) excluding H2 O by liquefaction. It is worth noting that much more oxygen was removed as H2 O rather than CO2 during the two-stage treatment compared with the direct liquefaction of the raw material. Most of the CO2 and H2 O from the two-stage treatment were formed at extraction stage. and the yields of soluble liquefaction were much smaller than those of the direct liquefaction of raw materials. The oxygen content of the oil from LY soluble liquefaction was 3.9 wt%. much lower than that from the direct liquefaction of the raw material.

One of the extracts had molecular weight of around 300 and was expected to be liquefied easily under relatively mild conditions. In this work the extracts. obtained from lowrank coal and biomass wastes. were liquefied at lower than 400 o C under the H2 pressure of as low as 2 MPa (at room temperature). Their parent materials were also liquefied for comparison purpose. The results showed that the oil (hexane soluble excluding water) yields reached to higher than 60% at 400 o C. Oxygen contents of the oils obtained from the extracts were much lower than those obtained from their parent materials. Furthermore. H2 consumptions and CO2 emissions of the extract liquefactions were rather lower than those of their parent material liquefactions.

Although aggregators optimize their decisions in a decentralized way. they are indirectly linked together if their respective consumers belong to the same distribution grid. Thus. a major issue for the distribution system operator (DSO). responsible of the good operation of the distribution network. is to ensure that the decentralized decisions taken do not violate the grid constraints and do not increase the global system costs. The problem is also challenging from the information point of view as the network state and characteristics usually constitute confidential information for the DSO. To address this issue. we propose a decentralized coordination procedure between the DSO and multiple aggregators.

1330449,A privacy-preserving distributed computational approach for distributed locational marginal prices,2021,Olivier Bilenne and Paulin Jacquot and Nadia Oudjane and Mathias Staudigl and Cheng Wan,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.14094,,,,An important issue in today's electricity markets is the management of flexibilities offered by new practices. such as smart home appliances or electric vehicles. By inducing changes in the behavior of residential electric utilities. demand response (DR) seeks to adjust the demand of power to the supply for increased grid stability and better integration of renewable energies. A key role in DR is played by emergent independent entities called load aggregators (LAs). We develop a new decentralized algorithm to solve a convex relaxation of the classical Alternative Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem. which relies on local information only. Each computational step can be performed in an entirely privacy-preserving manner. and system-wide coordination is achieved via node-specific distribution locational marginal prices (DLMPs). We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a 15-bus radial distribution network.,True,Hplp-sEAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14094,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14094,0,0,0

To optimize power generation or market costs and the integration of renewable energies. this operator relies on demand response techniques. that is. taking advantage of the flexibilities of some of the consumers electric appliances—those which can be controlled without impacting the consumer’s comfort. as electric vehicles or water heaters [Jac+ 19c]. However. for privacy reasons. consumers are not willing to provide neither their consumption constraints nor their consumption profiles to a central operator or any third party. as this information could be used to infer private information such as their presence at home.The global problem of the operator is to find an allocation of power (aggregate consumption) p=(pt) t at each time period (resource) t∈ T. such that p∈ P (feasibility constraints of power allocation. induced by the power plants constraints). Besides. this aggregate allocation has to match an individual consumption profile xn=(xn. t) t∈ T for each of the consumer (agent) n∈ N considered.

1330455,Fast Computation of Equilibria in Monotone Routing Games and Application to Electricity Demand Response,,Paulin Jacquot,,,,,,Routing games find many applications in various fields such as transportation. telecommunications or energy. The set of Nash Equilibria in this class of games is in general hard to compute. Here. we focus on the particular case of a parallel network and we address the computational issue of equilibria by providing two algorithms: the cycling best response dynamics and a projected gradient descent method. Under some monotonicity assumptions. we prove the convergence of those methods and we provide an upper bound on their convergence rate. Our convergence results state that. using one of these algorithms. the unique equilibrium of the game can be computed at an arbitrary precision in polynomial time. We give a practical application in the energy sector. where this framework and the associated results can be used to optimize the electricity consumption of flexible users.,True,Hplp-sEAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,http://smai-mode2018.imag.fr/resumes/resumesLong/subm25.pdf,,,,,http://smai-mode2018.imag.fr/resumes/resumesLong/subm25.pdf,0,0,0

AlGaN/GaN Schottky devices have been suggested to have a negligible reverse recovery current during turn-off and can therefore be switched at very high frequencies with low power losses [1-2].

TCAD models of a SiC Schottky diode and an AlGaN/GaN diode have been developed and calibrated against fabricated devices for a better physical understanding of the experimentally observed results.

When the drain of the p-GaN HEMT is biased in the OFF-state the threshold voltage (Vth) shows a linear increase up to ~40%. This increase saturates at drain bias voltages above 50 V. The positive Vth shift is attributed to the ionization of acceptor traps in the AlGaN region below the p-GaN gate with the source of these trapping sites suggested to be the p-GaN gate out-diffused Mg dopant atoms. The ionization of the Mg acceptors due to high electric field during OFF-state bias and the removal of the generated holes from the AlGaN region through the gate contact creates the charge conditions for a positive Vth shift.

In this study. an enhancement mode GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) is switched in a clamped inductive switching configuration with the aim of investigating the source of oscillatory effects observed. These arise as a result of the increased switching speed capability of GaN devices compared to their silicon counterparts. The study identifies the two major mechanisms (Miller capacitance charge and parasitic common source inductance) that can lead to ringing behaviour during turn-off and considers the effect of temperature on the latter. Furthermore. the experimental results are backed by SPICE modelling to evaluate the contribution of different circuit components to oscillations.

1330473,GaN-on-Silicon HEMTs and Schottky diodes for high voltage applications,2017,Loizos Efthymiou,,,,,,Gallium Nitride (GaN) is considered a very promising material for use in the field of power devices as its application in power systems would result in a significant increase in the power density. reduced power losses. and the potential to operate at high frequencies. The wide bandgap of the material allows a high critical electric field to be sustained which can lead to the design of devices with a shorter drift region. and therefore with lower on-state resistance. if compared to a silicon-based device with the same breakdown voltage. The use of an AlGaN/GaN heterostructure allows the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the heterointerface where carriers can reach very high mobility values. These properties can lead to the production of High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) and Schottky barrier diodes with superior performance. even when compared to devices based on state-of-the-art technologies such as Silicon Carbide or superjunctions. Furthermore. epitaxial growth of GaN layers on silicon wafers allows a significant reduction in the production cost and makes these devices competitive from a price perspective.

1330474,The effect of power distribution privatization on electricity prices in Turkey: Has liberalization served the purpose?,2013,Hatice Karahan and Mehmet Toptas,63,Energy Policy,,614-621,Elsevier,Various electricity reforms have been adopted by a number of countries within the last 2 decades. Turkey. as one of those countries. has restructured its electricity market and intensively privatized the distribution companies. As one of the main targets of the liberalization efforts in the sector was announced to be reduced consumer prices. it is a matter of interest to look at the related developments after privatizations. Hence. this study attempts to explore the impact of power distribution privatization in Turkey on the national end-user electricity prices. Results of the analysis suggest that privatization of electricity distribution companies has not yielded the expected retail price declines within the first 4 years of the program. Whereas wholesale tariffs exhibit a reduction in the rate of 10%. retail tariffs show an increase of 5.9% within the period in question. Besides. the unstable patterns of the two tariffs imply that the market …,True,aL9cErkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,33,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142151300894X,18111642796700433436,/scholar?cites=18111642796700433436,,,,0,0,0

Bu ilişkinin perde arkasında yatan neden ise. iki açıdan ele alınabilir. Bunlardan ilki. belirsizliğin olduğu bir ortamda karar vericilerin ufkunun daralması ve böylelikle optimal olmayan makroekonomik politikaları uygulamaya koymaları olarak özetlenebilir. Para ve maliye otoritelerinin görüş mesafesini kısaltan ve uzun vadeli etkileri olmayan kararlar almalarına neden olan söz konusu siyasi belirsizlik. aynı zamanda ekonominin diğer aktörlerini de olumsuz olarak etkilemektedir. Nitekim gerek ürün gerekse finans piyasalarındaki oyuncular. istikrarsızlık durumunun hâkim olduğu bir atmosferde sağlıklı öngörüler yapamamakta ve riskten kaçınma psikolojisi bağlamında kısıtlı hareket etmek zorunda kalmaktadır. Bu durum. politika kararlarının sık değişime uğramasıyla ve volatilitenin yüksek olmasıyla da büyük ölçüde ilişkilidir.Politik istikrarsızlığın çeşitli dereceleri ve buna bağlı tanımlamaları mevcuttur.

Moreover. there has been a growing consensus lately on the role of diversification as a protection tool against crises and shocks. In other words. countries with higher export concentrations are thought to be exposed to more susceptibilities and vice versa. Hence. for most developing countries. for which exports performance are vital. understanding the so-called association matters. This study aims at providing evidence for certain emerging economies in that respect and starts with illustrating the performance of the BRICS and MINT economies in terms of product/sector and market diversification in the 2000s.

Türkiye ekonomisi küresel rekabet ortamında 2002 yılından itibaren girdiği yeni ekonomik süreçle birlikte sürekli artan bir pazar büyüklüğüne ulaşmıştır. Ayrıca dış ticaret hacmi 2008 küresel ekonomik kriz yılına kadar sürekli artmıştır. 2009 yılında küresel ekonomik krizin etkisiyle dış ticaret hacmi düşmüş fakat 2010 yılındaki hızlı toparlanmayla birlikte dış ticaret hacminde artış başlamış ve ihracat da artmaya devam etmiştir. Böylece 2011 yılında 134. 9. 2012 yılında 152. 6 milyar. 2013 yılında ise ihracat 151. 9 milyar dolar olarak gerçekleşmiştir.Bununla birlikte. 2012 yılındaki ihracat artışında altın ticaretinin önemli bir rol oynadığı belirtilmelidir. Nitekim 2013 yılında ihracatın yüzde 0. 4 oranında düşmesine de. bu durumun sebep olduğu görülmektedir. Bir diğer deyişle. 2013 yılında mal ihracatında önemli artışlar gerçekleşmiş ancak altın ihracatının baz etkisi nedeniyle toplam ihracat bir miktar düşüş kaydetmiştir.(Grafik 1).

1330484,Impact of human capital on entrepreneurial earnings: Employing parametric and nonparametric methods,2013,Hatice Karahan,5,Journal of Economics and Behavioral Studies,5,307,International Foundation for Research and Development,Economics literature provides ample evidence regarding the important positive effect of human capital on earnings. However. the self-employed have been consistently omitted in such studies. To fill this gap. I examine the effect of human capital on entrepreneurial earnings using National Survey of College Graduates dataset. To estimate the coefficients on income levels. I take advantage of three different econometric methods. namely OLS. Heckit and matching estimators. Regression results on men show that having higher education brings more success in terms of self-employment earnings. Evidence shows that men do better when they are self-employed whereas women are better off when they are wage workers. The most lucrative majors for male entrepreneurs are architecture. math. physics. chemistry and most fields of engineering. Women entrepreneurs who enjoy higher earnings are mostly majored in architecture. medicine. law. psychology and counseling. However. no particular education level is found to contribute to female entrepreneurial earnings.,True,aL9cErkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,3,https://ojs.amhinternational.com/index.php/jebs/article/view/406,17638652225171570099,/scholar?cites=17638652225171570099,,,https://ojs.amhinternational.com/index.php/jebs/article/download/406/406,0,0,0

1330490,How to design nationally strategic R&D plans? Employing a MCDM model,2013,Hatice Karahan,7,Journal of Economic & Management Perspectives,3,5,International Economic Society,According to the endogenous growth theory. economic development which is mainly driven by productivity growth is determined by the rate of technological progress. in the long run. A good number of studies that empirically tested this relationship reported a positive effect of research and development (R&D) activities on productivity growth and hence on economic performance. especially for developing countries. However. the way to determine the strategic R&D areas which constitute the essential component of effective national policies still remains ambiguous. Therefore. this paper attempts to model an index for this purpose. based on a multi-decision criteria model (MCDM). namely Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). by using an import-approach.

1330491,Pricing Electric Power under a Hybrid Wholesale Mechanism: Evaluating the Turkish Electricity Market,2013,Hatice Karahan and Mehmet Toptas,3,International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy,3,221-228,,During the restructuring process. Turkish electricity sector has gone through significant changes both in wholesale and retail markets. In this framework. the Market Financial Settlement Mechanism established for handling market imbalances has become a spot market in time. So. it can be claimed that the wholesale electricity market in Turkey is a hybrid mechanism composed of bilateral contracts and the balancing market. On the other hand. the main target of liberalization program is providing consumers with affordable electric power. Hence. this study attempts to explore the link between retail tariffs for ineligible consumers and prices in the two wholesale mechanisms. in the period after the launch of the day-ahead market. Findings suggest that regulated wholesale prices are more effective in the determination of end-user prices. whereas unregulated ones might have a price reduction effect in case the free market dominates. However. the volatility in spot market prices implies that the sector would better continue with the hybrid mechanism for quite some time.,True,aL9cErkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/58283859/279.pdf,4561495220437772883,/scholar?cites=4561495220437772883,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/58283859/279.pdf,0,0,0
