117907,The effect of fire on soil organic matter—a review,2004,José A González-Pérez and Francisco J González-Vila and Gonzalo Almendros and Heike Knicker,30,,6,855-870,Pergamon,The extent of the soil organic carbon pool doubles that present in the atmosphere and is about two to three times greater than that accumulated in living organisms in all Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. In such a scenario. one of the several ecological and environmental impacts of fires is that biomass burning is a significant source of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. Nevertheless. the oxidation of biomass is usually incomplete and a range of pyrolysis compounds and particulate organic matter (OM) in aerosols are produced simultaneously to the thermal modification of pre-existing C forms in soil. These changes lead to the evolution of the OM to “pyromorphic humus”. composed by rearranged macromolecular substances of weak colloidal properties and an enhanced resistance against chemical and biological degradation. Hence the occurrence of fires in both undisturbed and agricultural …,True,Os9vf34AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1092,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412004000376,9503604196591416615,/scholar?cites=9503604196591416615,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/49123/3/Effect_of_fire.pdf,0,0,0

A review,2007,Heike Knicker,85,Biogeochemistry,1,91-118,Kluwer Academic Publishers,After vegetation fires considerable amounts of severely or partly charred necromass (referred to here as char) are incorporated into the soil. with long-term consequences for soil C and N dynamics and thus N availability for primary production and C and N transport within the soil column. Considering results reported in the pyrolysis literature in combination with those obtained from controlled charring of plant material and soil organic matter (SOM). it has become clear that common models claiming char as a graphite-like material composed mainly of highly condensed polyaromatic clusters may be oversimplified. Instead. I suggest a concept in which char is a heterogeneous mixture of heat-altered biopolymers with domains of relatively small polyaromatic clusters. but considerable substitution with N.

Of this. soil organic matter accounts for about 30% of the carbon present. In addition. SOM has an average carbon/nitrogen ratio of 10/1 and contains a huge fraction of the total nitrogen available for plant growth [1]. Taking into account that the abundance of nitrogen in the earth's crust is much lower than that of carbon. this is a significant fraction of the total nitrogen accessible to the biosphere. Under natural soil conditions. without the addition of mineral fertilizers. SOM provides the majority of the nitrogen necessary for plant growth. It is also thought to be responsible for the interaction between agricultural biocides and the soil [5-7]. The chemical structure of this ubiquitous material.

In this review. recent studies using solid‐state 15N NMR spectroscopy for the examination of the fate of biogenic N in soils are summarized.

Using PKC isozymes purified from Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells. we show here that PKC is not able to activate Src directly. Our data reveal that the PKC-dependent Src activation occurs via the activation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) PTPα. PTPα becomes activated in vivo after TPA stimulation. Further. we show that PKCδ phosphorylates and activates only PTPα in vitro but not any other of the TPA-responsive PKC isozymes that are expressed in A7r5 rat aortic smooth muscle cells.

These cells accumulate in mucosal tissues of allergic reactions. where immunoglobulin E (IgE) is produced locally. Here we provide evidence that. in addition to antigen that can attract IgE-bound mast cells. the type of IgE molecules that efficiently activate mast cells can promote the migration of mast cells in the absence of antigen. IgE- and IgE+Ag-mediated migration involves an autocrine/paracrine secretion of soluble factors including adenosine. leukotriene B4. and several chemokines. Their secretion depends on 2 tyrosine kinases. Lyn and Syk. and they are agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors and signal through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ. leading to mast cell migration. In mouse experiments. naive mast cells are attracted to IgE. and IgE-sensitized mast cells are attracted to antigen. Therefore.

The protein kinase C (PKC) family centrally regulates platelet activation. and it is becoming clear that the individual PKC isoforms play distinct roles. some of which oppose each other. Here. for the first time. we address all four of the major platelet-expressed PKC isoforms. determining their comparative roles in regulating platelet adhesion to collagen and their subsequent activation under physiological flow conditions. Using mouse gene knock-out and pharmacological approaches in human platelets. we show that collagen-dependent α-granule secretion and thrombus formation are mediated by the conventional PKC isoforms. PKCα and PKCβ. whereas the novel isoform. PKCθ. negatively regulates these events. PKCδ also negatively regulates thrombus formation but not α …,True,90Qnj3QAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C,101,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820603817,2223171316859431961,/scholar?cites=2223171316859431961,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820603817,0,0,0
118005,Atypical protein kinase Cι is required for bronchioalveolar stem cell expansion and lung tumorigenesis,2009,Roderick P Regala and Rebecca K Davis and Alyssa Kunz and Andras Khoor and Michael Leitges and Alan P Fields,69,Cancer research,19,7603-7611,American Association for Cancer Research,Protein kinase Cι (PKCι) is an oncogene required for maintenance of the transformed phenotype of non–small cell lung cancer cells. However. the role of PKCι in lung tumor development has not been investigated. To address this question. we established a mouse model in which oncogenic KrasG12D is activated by Cre-mediated recombination in the lung with or without simultaneous genetic loss of the mouse PKCι gene. Prkci. Genetic loss of Prkci dramatically inhibits Kras-initiated hyperplasia and subsequent lung tumor formation in vivo. This effect correlates with a defect in the ability of Prkci-deficient bronchioalveolar stem cells to undergo Kras-mediated expansion and morphologic transformation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore. the small molecule PKCι inhibitor aurothiomalate inhibits Kras-mediated bronchioalveolar stem cell expansion and lung tumor growth in vivo. Thus. Prkci is required for oncogene …,True,90Qnj3QAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC,101,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/69/19/7603.short,14742056658648452310,/scholar?cites=14742056658648452310,,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/69/19/7603.full.pdf,0,0,0

Presently. we evaluated the effects of knockout of the PKCβ gene on overall glucose homeostasis and insulin regulation of glucose transport. To evaluate subtle differences in glucose homeostasis in vivo. knockout mice were extensively backcrossed in C57BL/6 mice to diminish genetic differences other than the absence of the PKCβ gene. PKCβ−/− knockout offspring obtained through this backcrossing had 10% lower blood glucose levels than those observed in PKCβ+/+ wild-type offspring in both the fasting state and 30 min after ip injection of glucose despite having similar or slightly lower serum insulin levels.

PKC-δ and RasGRP set a threshold for proapoptotic Erk signaling during B cell development,2011,Andre Limnander and Philippe Depeille and Tanya S Freedman and Jen Liou and Michael Leitges and Tomohiro Kurosaki and Jeroen P Roose and Arthur Weiss,12,Nature immunology,5,425-433,Nature Publishing Group,Clonal deletion of autoreactive B cells is crucial for the prevention of autoimmunity. but the signaling mechanisms that regulate this checkpoint remain undefined. Here we characterize a previously unrecognized Ca 2+-driven pathway for activation of the kinase Erk. which was proapoptotic and biochemically distinct from Erk activation induced by diacylglycerol (DAG). This pathway required protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ) and the guanine nucleotide–exchange factor RasGRP and depended on the concentration of the Ca 2+ sensor STIM1. which controls the magnitude of Ca 2+ entry. Developmental regulation of these proteins was associated with selective activation of the pathway in B cells prone to negative selection. This checkpoint was impaired in PKC-δ-deficient mice. which developed B cell autoimmunity. Conversely. overexpression of STIM1 conferred a competitive disadvantage to developing B cells.

Here. we report that podocyte-specific deletion of aPKCλ/ι in mice results in severe proteinuria. nephrotic syndrome. and death at 4 to 5 wk after birth. Podocyte foot processes of knockout mice developed structural defects. including mislocalization of the slit diaphragm. In the glomerulus. aPKCλ/ι was primarily expressed in developing glomerular epithelial cells and podocyte foot processes. Interestingly. under physiologic conditions. aPKCλ/ι translocated from the apical surface to the basolateral side of developing podocytes. and this translocation preceded the development of foot processes and formation of slit …,True,90Qnj3QAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC,94,https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/20/4/798.short,13367153298677319916,/scholar?cites=13367153298677319916,,https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/jnephrol/20/4/798.full.pdf,0,0,0
