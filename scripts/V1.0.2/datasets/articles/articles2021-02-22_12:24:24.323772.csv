F is a herb found in tropical rainforest countries and has been widely used in traditional medicine especially in Peninsular Malaysia to treat male infertility problems and increase human health. Ten percent aqueous extraction of PGR was prepared by heating in 40Âº C for 12 hours and its decoction were freeze dried to obtain crude extract. Total numbers of 24 male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups which NEC. POC. PGR50 and PGR800. Except for NEC group. other groups were induced genitotoxicity by oral supplementation of 200 mg/kg of BPA for 21 consecutive days. Â For PGR50 and PGR800 groups. the animals were concomitantly supplemented with 50 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg of PGR extracts respectively. Blood and testes sample were collected for hormonal and testes morphometric analysis. Results clearly showed that that testosterone (T). the most important hormone in spermatogenesis process were significantly increased in PGR supplemented groups (p< 0.05) compared to NEC and POC groups. For the level of DHT. FSH. and LH hormonal level. the results were varies and can be explained with the deterioration effects of BPA and the hormonal regulations itself. Testes morphometric study showed no significant difference in the seminiferous tubule diameter in each groups but was significantly increased (p< 0.05) in the epithelium height. which indicates higher rate of spermatogenesis process. In addition. PGR possessed a protective effect against the toxicity effects of BPA. In conclusion.

In Biology the maths problem manifests as a rigid stance of students claiming that they can’t do maths and a reluctance to participate in biology when the focus shifts to data-handling and calculations. We hypothesis that this ‘rigidity’masks a high degree of attitudinal complexity that is effecting student engagement with learning; the link between attitude. Studies from the past decade or more have demonstrated that approximately half of life science students lack confidence in in their mathematical abilities (Tariq. 2002; McMullan. et al.. 2012; Quinnell & Wong. 2007). and this has implications for students actively engaging in biology when it looks to them like maths.

Iron addition experiments utilizing the synthetic iron source. FeCl 3. have been performed in all major HNLC regions and have resulted in diatom blooms with significant implications for ecosystem productivity and resilience. If FeCl 3 and natural iron sources differ in bioavailability. and hence potential phytoplankton production. re-interpretation of these results is warranted. To test the hypothesis that natural and synthetic iron sources are differentially bioavailable. we performed a deck-board iron addition experiment in the summer of 2019. We exposed the NGA HNLC phytoplankton community to three iron sources: FeCl 3. the Copper River plume. and an HNLC control and assessed net growth. photosynthetic efficiency. community composition. and nutrient use over a 5 d incubation. Addition of the FeCl 3 and Copper River plume iron sources alleviated iron stress for the total phytoplankton community. yet the bioavailability of these two iron sources was size-dependent. Cells> 20 µm responded differently to all three iron sources. with net growth rates and photosynthetic efficiency being highest in the FeCl 3 treatment and intermediate in the Copper River plume treatment.

However. drying RBCs invariably compromises their integrity and has detrimental effects on hemoglobin function due to autoxidation. We have previously demonstrated an RBC desiccation and rehydration process that preserves RBC antigenic epitopes better than frozen RBCs. This study expands on those observations by examining what effects this desiccation process has on RBC hemoglobin function with respect to oxygen binding properties. In this paper. we examined RBCs from normal donors which were desiccated to 25% moisture content and stored dry for 2 weeks at room temperature prior to rehydration with plasma followed by structural and functional studies. Our data showed that approximately 98% of the RBCs were intact upon rehydration based on hemolysis assays. Oxygen dissociation curves for the desiccated/rehydrated RBCs showed a left shift compared to fresh RBCs (pO2 = 17 mmHg vs. 26 mmHg. respectively). The desiccated/rehydrated RBCs also showed an increase in methemoglobin compared to fresh RBCs (4.5% vs 0.9%. respectively). 2.3-Diphosphoglycerate concentration of the desiccated/rehydrated RBCs was reduced by 20%. In conclusion. although this RBC dehydration process preserves RBC integrity and hemoglobin oxygen binding properties better than most other dehydration techniques described so far. further optimization and long-term studies are needed to make this procedure acceptable for human transfusion.,True,SqHrkioAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,https://scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=63348,1624584202394591709,/scholar?cites=1624584202394591709,,https://scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=63348,0,0,0

Polymorphisms at the protein level are also estimated to correlate with increased risk factors for heart attacks. One such polymorphism is the V279F polymorphism in Lp-PLA2 which results in a change in enzyme performance capability. This in turn implies a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarct (AMI) in Korean and Indonesian subpopulations.Aim: This study aimed to analyze changes in protein properties. structure. energy stability. epitope. and immunogenicity that are due to the substitution of the Valine (V) amino acid at position 279 to Phenylalanine (F) in the Lp-PLA2 protein.Methodology: The role of Lp-PLA2 in the cardiovascular process and in AMI was analyzed based on the protein-protein network according to the BioGRID. MENTHA. and STRING databases. Protein properties and energy stability were examined by FoldX; this was followed by identification of epitope using ElliPro. The immunogenicity was evaluated in vivo by injecting the protein into mice and subsequently measuring their antibody production using the ELISA technique.Results: The substitution of Valine for Phenylalanine was predicted to increase protein stability and epitope shifts. Further studies on animal experiments exhibit that the 279V variant is able to induce IgG production better than the 279F variant.Conclusion: Based on these data. it can be concluded that the V279F polymorphism influences the surface structure. energy stability. epitope and immunogenicity of the Lp-PLA2 protein.

In this review. we discuss links between the bacterial species and cancer. with focus on immune responses for the stimulation of tumor cells such as induction of inflammation. Finally. we will describe the potential therapeutic strategies of bacteria on target tumors to improve treatment while mitigating adverse reactions. Cancer is a series of genetic changes that transform normal cells into tumor cells. These changes come from several reasons. including smoking. drinking alcohol. sunlight. exposure to chemical or physical factors. and finally chronic infection with microorganisms. including bacteria. In fact. bacterial infections are not carcinogenic. but recently it was discovered that the association between bacteria and cancer is through two mechanisms. the first stimulating chronic inflammation and the second producing carcinogenic metabolites.

Conservation tillage has become a standard practice for most producers. In addition. winter cover crops of wheat or rye often are planted in row middles in Northeast Arkansas to reduce damage associated with wind and blowing sand. One concern among producers and their crop advisors is the potential for outbreaks of pest insects in low-till systems because of increased availability of plant hosts in spring. and the “low-spray” environments in the post-boll weevil era. Tillage practices may affect other arthropods. including beneficial natural enemies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the three different tillage systems (conventional tillage. cover crop. and no-till) on abundance of soil-surface arthropods during two production seasons.,True,-4j_PTMAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,0,https://agcomm.uark.edu/agnews/publications/618.pdf#page=134,,,,https://agcomm.uark.edu/agnews/publications/618.pdf#page=134,0,0,0

To identify high seed yielding accessions and genotypes. plantation of six exotic and one indigenous collections planted in 1988 were evaluated for seed yield in 2003 and 2007. Highest number of plants yielding seeds was from EC87/7493. which was found to have maximum survival after 19 years of establishment. Maximum average seed yield of seed yielding plants was 1.17 kg for Sudan collection in 2003. and 0.92 kg for EC87/7493 in 2007. Individual trees of Sudan material yielded the maximum seed in 2003 and in 2007. There was not much change in the average seed yield of seed yielding trees of 2003 and 2007. Positive and significant relationship of seed yield of 2003 and 2007 showed that high yielding genotypes could be selected at early stage. Six plants were selected on the basis of seed yield out of which three were from Sudan material and others were from EC87/7490 (Niger).

These infections are thought to be transmitted through blood-feeding arthropod vectors such as ticks. fleas and lice. The purpose of this study is to detect the presence of Bartonella species from tick samples collected from small mammals in mangrove forests of Peninsular Malaysia. Herein. 38 individual ticks and their small mammals host were evaluated for the presence of Bartonella DNA by conventional PCR targeting the 16S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ITS) and partial sequencing of 460 bp from this locususing Bartonella genus-specific primers. Two tick individuals from Dermacentor auratus and Haemaphysalis hystricis collected from Rattus tiomanicus (host). were PCR-positive for Bartonella DNA amplification. No Bartonella amplification was possible in other tick species (Amblyomma sp.).

However. little study has been conducted on island habitat. Pangkor Island is a virgin jungle reserve and one of the most popular tourist attraction located at Perak. Malaysia. This preliminary survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of ectoparasites on small mammals residing in this island’s forests. Small mammals were trapped by deploying 50 cage traps at two different sites which were Pangkor Selatan and Sg. Pinang forests. Ectoparasites were extracted from the captured individuals. Identification of the ectoparasite species was performed based on morphological features and molecular approach using COI (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) genes. A total of 13 individuals of small mammals belonging to 4 species (Maxomys surifer. Rattus tiomanicus. Maxomys rajah. Callosciurus notatus) were captured in the study areas. From these. 5 individuals from 2 small mammal species were infested with mites only. identified as Laelaps sp. The most infested host species was Maxomys rajah. Ectoparasites load in M. rajah was higher with 27 individual’s mites collected. compared to Rattus tiomanicus with 7. This study provides information on ectoparasites present on small mammal hosts within the study areas. Our findings suggest that the resident and tourist of the island area were exposed to mite bites and potentially infected by mite-borne disease. therefore. precaution should be taken to avoid contact with small mammal hosts by improving the cleanliness of the island.,True,9a317nYAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,1,http://ejournals.ukm.my/serangga/article/view/27079,1514233775782872451,/scholar?cites=1514233775782872451,,http://ejournals.ukm.my/serangga/article/download/27079/8512,0,0,0

This study was carried out to test the ability of copolymer of poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (dimethylsiloxane) compound (PEG-PDMS) at different ratios in inhibiting marine bacterial growth and biofilm formation. Staphylococcus sp. was used due to its ability in producing strong biofilm. For antibacterial and antibiofilm test. spread plate technique was carried out to obtain CFU/mL values for each ratios of PEG-PDMS copolymers used. After that. Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (VPSEM) observation on biofilm attached on the surface of PEG-PDMS copolymer was carried out to support the results achieved in the analysis of antibiofilm activity. The results showed that there were no noticeable changes between treatments of shaking and static conditions where the bacterial growth experienced maximum inhibition in the presence of copolymer PEG-PU with the values of 4.10× 104 CFU/mL (shaking) and 3.00× 104 CFU/mL (static).

In order to limit the effect of pollut ion on various organisms. assesments must be made which may determine thresholds of toxicity (1). The azo dyes are a particular class of compunds which may reach aquatic habitats and are used in various industries such as textiles. with contamination of waters reported (2). The synthetic Congo Red dye is used mainly in textile dyeing and laboratory applications and is an azo dye. water soluble. thus difficult to degrade and potentially toxic compound (3).

1090626,Anti-adhesion therapy: a promising alternative in the infection treatment.,2018,Mohammed Abdullah Ajeel and Muhammad A Alkataan and Waleed Khalid Madle and Wijdan IA Abd-alwahab,15,Iraq J Pharm Vol,1,,,Objective: Antibiotic resistance (AR) represents one of the most important health problems worldwide due to the fact that it significantly lowers the number of effective antibacterial agents. Many mechanisms were studied to reduce emerge of AR. one of these is the use of Anti-adhesion Methods: Most of the available articles were searched using the search keywords. Here. we reviewed different strategies of anti-adhesion therapy. Following that. a grammatical examination was made for the vocabulary associated with the literature review. Results: Anti-adhesion agents represent an important strategy to prevent or treat bacterial infections. As these agents focus on bacterial virulence properties (eg adhesion and colonization). These agents considered a perfect alternative for an antibiotic. with the advantage of inhibiting the infectious process in the first step to reduce the damage. These agents inhibit attachment of bacteria to the host cell surface by interfering with host receptor assembly. bacteria-host cell adhesion assembly or adhesion biosynthesis. Antibodies of bacterial adhesions can block surface epitopes required for bacteria-host cell binding by the application of anti-adhesion strategy to decrease AR or reduce the need for the effective antibiotic doses. Conclusions: Anti-adhesion therapy involves attempts for blocking adherence. biofilm formation. and reduces virulence. These have benefits over traditional antibiotics by inhibiting pathogenicity without killing bacteria and it also have a synergistic effect when applied with antibiotics.,True,jmBpy4UAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://iphr.mosuljournals.com/article_164170_e75d4e3f7350e0637fbfa1e94a521b86.pdf,,,,https://iphr.mosuljournals.com/article_164170_e75d4e3f7350e0637fbfa1e94a521b86.pdf,0,0,0

Evolution of pathogens within the lifetime of a host individual is implicated as a strong selective force in the evolution of sex and aging in the host. However. this assumption or its testable predictions have not been examined empirically. We classified infectious bacteria and viruses into those that can have continued long-term existence on the host body (group 1) versus those that have only a short-term interaction during an active infection (group 2). We surveyed the literature for age-specific incidence data about infections from both the groups. The age trends of the two groups show contrasting patterns. The incidence of infections by all group 1 pathogens showed a 2.28- to 28-fold increase in older ages. In group 2. 6 out of the 9 pathogens showed a significant declining trend in incidence with …,True,zVc02IkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-020-0025-x,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-020-0025-x,0,0,0

1090656,Blind fish,2018,Akanksha Ojha and Milind Watve,,,,,,Lay Summary: Different species of vertebrates have conditions similar to human obesity. insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Increasing number of studies are now revealing that the causes and interrelationships between these states are substantially different in different species. Comparative physiology may turn out to be an eye opener for evolutionary theories of diabetes. Obesity induced insulin resistance is believed to be central to type 2 diabetes. Recent work on Mexican cavefish. Astyanax mexicanus. has revealed a hyperglycemic phenotype similar to human type 2 diabetes but here insulin resistance is the cause of obesity rather than an effect. Instead of developing diabetic complications. the hyperglycemic fish lead a healthy and long life. In addition to fish. insulin resistance in hibernating bears. dolphins. horses. bonnet macaques and chimpanzees demonstrate that the relationship between diet. obesity. insulin sensitivity and diabetes is widely different in different species. Evolutionary hypotheses about type 2 diabetes should explain these differences.,True,zVc02IkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/243d/b70760d51aac8007c7015fdce61073dba242.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/243d/b70760d51aac8007c7015fdce61073dba242.pdf,0,0,0

Although the occurrence of both Birmingham-area events on the same weekend was a coincidence. the purpose of each was the same: to inspire people with wonder and appreciation for the beauty of local biodiversity and to increase awareness of the vulnerable species and habitats in need of protection.The BioBlitz was a hands-on encounter with Alabama’s native wildlife. in which participants attempted to observe and document as many species as possible within a 24-hour period in the preserve. Scientists. students. and local nature enthusiasts turned out for this event equipped with nets and field guides. Among the participants this year were members of the North American Native Fishes Association as well as environmental science students from Birmingham Southern College. Though plenty of locals were in attendance. some individuals had traveled from as far away as Florida and Indiana. Birds. bats. reptiles. amphibians. flowers. insects. and fishes were identified to species and added to a running diversity total.

Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) can be linked to severe honey bee health problems. Breeding for virus resistance may improve honey bee health. To evaluate the potential for this approach. we compared the survival of IAPV infection among stocks from the US We complemented the survival analysis with a survey of existing viruses in these stocks and assessing constitutive and induced expression of immune genes. Worker offspring from selected queens in a common apiary were inoculated with IAPV by topical applications after emergence to assess subsequent survival. Differences among stocks were small compared to variation within stocks. indicating the potential for improving honey bee survival of virus infections in all stocks. A positive relation between worker survival and virus load among stocks further suggested that honey bees may be able to adapt to better cope with viruses. while our molecular studies indicate that toll-6 may be related to survival differences among virus-infected worker bees. Together. these findings highlight the importance of viruses in queen breeding operations and provide a promising starting point for the quest to improve honey bee health by selectively breeding stock to be better able to survive virus infections.

Dalet,28,Philippine Journal of Crop Science (Philippines)  ISSN : 0115-463X,Supplement 1,,Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,Rice tungro disease (RTD). a composite disease caused by two kinds of viruses-rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) and rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV). is known to be the most widespread and destructive disease of rice in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Current Knowledge of rice-tungro virus interaction at the molecular level is still very limited. The specific host genes that are expressed during the early stages of viral infection and the role of these genes in pathogen recognition and elicitation of the resistance reaction in the host plant have not been specifically identified. Therefore. research on gene expression in plant during rice tungro virus infection will provide substantial answers to the questions regarding the nature and mechanism of RTV resistance in rice. Based on the knowledge of the molecular basis of this interaction. it is possible to design an effective approach for breeding against the rice tungro disease. The authors have embarked on the isolation of genes involved in the RTV resistance mechanism through a gene expression-based approach. RTV-resistant (IR73888) and RTV-susceptible (IR64) near isogenic lines were analyzed by different display of RT-PCR.

The GATA1 transcription factor is an established mediator of RBC development. However. the upstream mechanisms that regulate the expression of GATA1 are not completely characterized. Cholesterol is 1 potential upstream mediator of GATA1 expression because previously published studies suggest that defects in cholesterol synthesis disrupt RBC differentiation. Here we characterize RBC development in a zebrafish harboring a single missense mutation in the hmgcs1 gene (Vu57 allele). hmgcs1 encodes the first enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway and mutation of hmgcs1 inhibits cholesterol synthesis.

Inc.,Inborn errors of cholesterol metabolism occur as a result of mutations in the cholesterol synthesis pathway (CSP). Although mutations in the CSP cause a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome. craniofacial abnormalities are a hallmark phenotype associated with these disorders. Previous studies have established that mutation of the zebrafish hmgcs1 gene (Vu57 allele). which encodes the first enzyme in the CSP. causes defects in craniofacial development and abnormal neural crest cell (NCC) differentiation. However. the molecular mechanisms by which the products of the CSP disrupt NCC differentiation are not completely known. Cholesterol is known to regulate the activity of WNT signaling. an established regulator of NCC differentiation.

The HCFC1 gene encodes a transcriptional co-factor that regulates cell proliferation. and previous studies suggest that HCFC1 regulates NPC number and differentiation. However. the molecular mechanism underlying these cellular deficits has not been completely characterized. Here we created a zebrafish harboring mutations in the hcfc1a gene (the hcfc1aco60/+ allele). one ortholog of HCFC1. and utilized immunohistochemistry and RNA-sequencing technology to understand the function of hcfc1a during neural development. The hcfc1aco60/+ allele results in an increased number of NPCs and increased expression of neuronal and glial markers. These neural developmental deficits are associated with larval hypomotility and the abnormal expression of asxl1. a polycomb transcription factor. which we identified as a downstream effector of hcfc1a. Inhibition of asxl1 activity and/or expression in larvae harboring the hcfc1aco60/+ allele completely restored the number of NPCs to normal levels.

1090721,Knockdown of hspg2 is associated with abnormal mandibular joint formation and neural crest cell dysfunction in zebrafish,2020,BS Castellanos and NG Reyes-Nava and A Quintana,,,,,,Background: Heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2) encodes for perlecan. a large proteoglycan that plays an important role in cartilage formation. cell adhesion. and basement membrane stability. Mutations in HSPG2 have been associated with Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome (SJS) and Dyssegmental Dysplasia Silverman-Handmaker Type (DDSH). two disorders characterized by skeletal abnormalities. These data indicate a function for HSPG2 in cartilage development/maintenance. However. the mechanisms in which HSPG2 regulates cartilage development are not completely understood. Here. we explored the relationship between this gene and craniofacial development through morpholino-mediated knockdown of hspg2 using zebrafish. Results: Knockdown of hspg2 resulted in abnormal development of the mandibular jaw joint at 5 days post fertilization (DPF). We surmised that defects in mandible development were a consequence of neural crest cell (NCC) dysfunction. as these multipotent progenitors produce the cartilage of the head. Early NCC development was normal in morphant animals as measured by distal-less homeobox 2a (dlx2a) and SRY-box transcription factor 10 (sox10) expression at 1 DPF. However. subsequent analysis at later stages of development (4 DPF) revealed a decrease in the number of Sox10+ and Collagen. type II. alpha 1a (Col2a1a)+ cells within the mandibular jaw joint region of morphants relative to random control injected embryos. Concurrently. morphants showed a decreased expression of nkx3. 2. a marker of jaw joint formation. at 4 DPF.

To understand the mechanisms by which GABRA1 regulates brain development. we developed a zebrafish model of gabra1 deficiency. gabra1 expression is restricted to the nervous system and behavioral analysis of morpholino injected larvae suggests that the knockdown of gabra1 results in hypoactivity and defects in the expression of other subunits of the …,True,QmYD8iwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://bio.biologists.org/content/9/4/bio051367?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Biol_Open_TrendMD_0,,,,https://bio.biologists.org/content/9/4/bio051367?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Biol_Open_TrendMD_0,0,0,0

A qualitative design was utilized in this study. Six higher education institutions were involved. This comprised two state universities. two private sectarian and two private non-sectarians in Cebu City. Respondents from each institution include Vice President for Administration. University Engineer. College Deans. faculty members. administrative staff. and students. Findings revealed that higher education institutions in Cebu City have done initial flurry on disaster risk-reduction management however considering that it is still sporadic for most of the respondents and on the initial stage for others; thus weaknesses are present. The possibility of being a victim is still lurking among the HEI’s. Having a disaster risk-reduction plan may better prepare the school community in the event of a disaster. The utmost desire of parents and school administrators is a safer environment. Hence. changing the mindset and scaffolding the skills on emergency preparedness of the school community are therefore recommended to becoming victors in the event of a calamity.,True,tXKlaGwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4,https://www.academia.edu/download/38095755/647-678.pdf,17293288504407184085,/scholar?cites=17293288504407184085,,https://www.academia.edu/download/38095755/647-678.pdf,0,0,0

SDG must be taught as early as possible for the students to have a good grasp of contextualized and localized events and be able to learn how to propose solutions to societal issues and concerns. This study aims to determine the extent of cascading SDG in the lesson plans of pre-service teachers. The study utilized mixed-method design. documentary analysis to determine the extent of integration of SDG in the lesson plans and quantitative method to identify the barriers and opportunities encountered by the pre-service teachers which were obtained through a focus group discussion. In this study the 110 Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) Major in General Education and Early Childhood Education pre-service teachers enrolled in their third year of the second semester. SY 2017-2018 was used as respondents. This study was conducted in a Teacher Training Institution (TEI). a state university in Cebu City. Results revealed that SDG's had a low-level integration in the lesson plans of the pre-service teachers. yet. the concept of the multidisciplinary approach was laudably used across various disciplines.

It aimed to promote mastery on this least mastered competency. It was administered to Grade 10 up-land students during their regular science lesson. Instruments such as pre/post-test questionnaires. performance indicator checklist of the central dogma of molecular biology processes. and attitude. interest. and behaviour inventory were employed to measure the effect on the three variables: understanding. performance. and engagement. respectively. Paired t-test was used to compare the pre-test and post-test results. Prior to the intervention. students had low conceptual understanding and manipulative skills. At the end of the contextualized instruction. a significant increase was observed. Respondents expressed a positively moderate level of engagement implying that their attitude. interest. and behaviour towards the lesson were enhanced by the approach. Pearson r-correlation was used to establish relationship among the three variables. Understanding and performance correlate with each other but not with engagement.

Non-chitosan loaded diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) was previously found to have anti-schistosomal activity. The present work aimed to prepare DDC-Chitosan-Na-nanoparticles (DDC-Chitosan-Na-NPs). and to investigate it’s in vitro anti-schistosomal activity with slow release approach and as well as its mortality % against both concentrations and exposure time. NPs were prepared by suspension cross linking method. in which 0.16 g chitosan were dissolved in 16 ml 2% acetic acid solution (ratio 1% wt/v.). Then after. 0.1g DDC-Na salt was added to the chitosan solution and 3.2 ml of glutaraldehyde as a cross linking agent was added into the mixture dropwise. NPs were washed several times with ethanol 70%. dried under vacuum. prepared for chemical characterization and biological assessment. Our data showed that the slow release of DDC-chitosan-NPs resulted in mortality effects on Schistosomal worms in vitro when applied with small dose for longer time. These data compared to those of prazoquantil (PZQ) as a reference drug showed that administration of DDC loaded with chitosan-NPs was more effective on the mortality of Schistosoma worms. In conclusion. DDC-Chitosan-NPs have lethal effects on S. mansoni worms in vitro by a unique mode of action in a way of concentration and exposure time dependent.

So far. this is the first study which tested the effect of different ratios of synthetic protein to fat (P: F) diets on the health of broodless nurseaged honey bees in the laboratory. The aim of the current study was to determine the load of DWV in the whole body of A. mellifera that were fed different ratios of P: F diets (25: 1. 10: 1. 5: 1. 1: 1. 1: 5. 1: 10. 1: 12.5 and 1: 0 as a control). The methods involved feeding bees the tested diets for 10 days and then measuring the virus titre using qPCR technique. The results showed that DWV concentration decreased as the fat content of diets consumed increased. The copy number of viral genomes declined from 7.5× 105 in the zero-fat diet (1: 0) to 1.6× 102 virus genomes in 1: 12.5 (P: F). We can conclude that there is a positive relationship between fat diets and bee immunity and overall results suggest a connection between fat diet and bee health. indicating that colony losses can be reduced by providing a certain protein and fat supplemental feeding.,True,Rokw0LsAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,http://journals.pan.pl/Content/119149?format_id=1,,,,http://journals.pan.pl/Content/119149?format_id=1,0,0,0

Many studies have shown that animals regulate the amount of protein and carbohydrate they eat for optimal performance. Regulation of dietary fat is important but less often studied. Honeybees collect and consume floral pollen to obtain protein and fat but how they achieve the optimal balance of these two macronutrients is presently unknown. Here. using chemically defined diets composed of essential amino acids and lipids (lecithin). we show that adult worker honeybees actively regulate their intake of lipids around optimal values relative to the amount of protein in their diet. We found that broodless. nurse-age worker honeybees consume foods to achieve a ratio between 1:2 and 1:3 for essential amino acids to lipid or ∼1.25:1 protein to fat.

Philippines,,Elsa May Delima-Baron and Renee Ureta and Evan Kaye Fancobila and Cherry Mae Badua and Cherry Lyn Ynot and Ceffrian Juriel Macad and Alma B Mohagan,,,,,,We inspected the band patterns of shells of land snails from Hikong Bente Falls of Lake Sebu in South Cotabato based on shell color and intensity of bands. The occurrence of the pattern was compared with habitat type: open. semi-open. and closed. Shells of land snails were handpicked in 200-m transects established in each habitat type. Shell coloration was noted and the band intensity was reported as either dark or faint. A total of 140 shells were collected and inspected in all sites representing seven species under five families. The species Ryssota maxima was the dominant species. common in all habitat types. Yellow. pink and brown colored shells were encountered during the time of sampling. Faint banded shells appear abundant in the area (79 shells) compared to dark banded (61 shells) which were found mostly in less open and closed habitats. Results may indicate probable adaptation of the land snail species in the site given pronounced open canopy forest which may lead to formation of possible polymorphs and may warrant further studies.,True,o6BRr3UAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elsa_May_Baron/publication/317956914_Band_Pattern_of_Land_Snail_Shells_from_Lake_Sebu_South_Cotabato_Philippines/links/5adbc508458515c60f5e06ca/Band-Pattern-of-Land-Snail-Shells-from-Lake-Sebu-South-Cotabato-Philippines.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elsa_May_Baron/publication/317956914_Band_Pattern_of_Land_Snail_Shells_from_Lake_Sebu_South_Cotabato_Philippines/links/5adbc508458515c60f5e06ca/Band-Pattern-of-Land-Snail-Shells-from-Lake-Sebu-South-Cotabato-Philippines.pdf,0,0,0

Although they are involved in a wide variety of functions. microtubules are structurally highly similar across most cell types and organisms. It was suggested that a “tubulin code.” formed by combinations of tubulin posttranslational modifications. adapts individual microtubules to specific functions within living cells. However. clear-cut functional and mechanistic data verifying this concept are still scarce. Glycylation is among the least explored posttranslational modifications of tubulin and has. so far. exclusively been found on microtubules of cilia and flagella from a variety of species. Previous work has suggested that glycylation might be essential for cilia and flagella. but mechanistic insight remains lacking.Two enzymes from the tubulin-tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family.

They are dynamically unstable. which is expressed in their constant presence in the phases of growth or shortening. Microtubules are involved in a variety of intracellular processes such as chromosome segregation and fission spindle formation. An effective method for studying the dynamics of microtubules is based on specific plus-tipinteracting proteins. They include a family of EB proteins (EB1. EB2. EB3) that autonomously recognize the plus-end of the microtubule. It is believed that they recognize the region rich in GTP-tubulins and responsible for the stability of the microtubule. In this paper. we decided to test this hypothesis by measuring the correlation between the size of the region recognized by the EB3 protein. the growth rate of the microtubule. and the growth time of the microtubule. The obtained data. especially in the context of comparison with the previously published in vitro experiments. allow us to better understand the nature of the change in the structure of the end of the microtubules during growth. and hence–bring us closer to understanding the mechanisms of dynamic instability of microtubules in living cells.,True,63Qw5PgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://pureportal.spbu.ru/files/9277355/Proceedings_BPPC_2017.pdf#page=73,,,,https://pureportal.spbu.ru/files/9277355/Proceedings_BPPC_2017.pdf#page=73,0,0,0

Short communication: Dugong dugon Müller. 1776 (Sirenia. Dugongidae) in Bangka Island. Indonesia. Biodiversitas 19: 823-830. Dugong dugon is a marine mammal species classified as Vulnerable. It has distribution in Indonesia. especially in Bangka Island. However. only four records of dugong were reported in Bangka Island in 1976. 2006. and 2007. In addition. there is little published information about local beliefs toward dugong and awareness actions toward dugong conservation in Bangka Island. This research compiled new records of dugong. local beliefs toward dugong. and awareness actions toward dugong conservation in Bangka Island. Sixteen new records of dugong were collected in Bangka Island leading to a total of 18 records for this island. All new records of dugong were obtained entirely from the eastern waters of Bangka Island. The new records also informed that most of the dugongs were found dead and entangled in gill nets. In addition. an interesting local belief caused Kurau Village becomes the most important location for fishermen to sell dead dugongs or dugongs’ meat. Furthermore. three main awareness actions toward dugong had been implemented in Bangka Island in 2017.,True,l9YeA-cAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://www.smujo.id/biodiv/article/view/2684,9826344924036790926,/scholar?cites=9826344924036790926,,https://www.smujo.id/biodiv/article/download/2684/2330,0,0,0

It is a flagship species of Bangka Island. listed as Endangered (EN) by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This research was undertaken with the aim to investigate Mentilin habitat in Bangka Regency. The research was conducted in Zed. Kemuja. Paya Benua and Petaling villages in Bangka Regency. Bangka-Belitung Islands Province. Indonesia from December 2015 to February 2016. The methods used to collect vegetation data were strip transect-line plots and strip transects. Across all habitats. we found 33 plant species from 22 families with 488 individuals. In general. the dominant vegetation in the study area was Hevea brasiliensis or jungle rubber. Rubber trees. poles. saplings and seedling layers were the main vegetation in all habitats. Clidemia hirta dominated ground cover layer in Zed. Kemuja and Paya Benua. In Petaling. Brachiaria mutica dominated. The study concluded that Mentilin in Bangka Regency were well adapted to habitat dominated by jungle rubber H. brasiliensis. Saplings were used by Mentilin for sleeping and foraging. Mentilin also used four sapling species as sleeping trees; these were Schima wallichii. Trema orientalis. Ficus annulata and F. aurata. This study demonstrates that areas dominated by jungle rubber provide important habitat for Mentilin. Consequently. some degree of protection of jungle rubber should be an important element in efforts to assure the conservation of this species in Bangka Regency. possibly along the lines of the IUCN Protected Area Category …,True,l9YeA-cAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,http://www.primate-sg.org/storage/asian-primates-journal/volume-81/2019Sep18_Article_2.pdf,,,,http://www.primate-sg.org/storage/asian-primates-journal/volume-81/2019Sep18_Article_2.pdf,0,0,0

The study aimed to assess the prospects of using this plant in the management of environmental quality in Azerbaijan. Four test sites. which differ in the degree of environmental pollution. were selected for the study. Two test sites are located in Baku. the capital city that has a rather high level of pollution. The other two test sites are located in the country. The bioindicative propertiesof chestnut-leaved oak were investigated by analyzing the developmental stability of leaves morphogenesis. To determine the developmental stability of leaves. the method of fluctuating asymmetry was used. Thebioaccumulativepropertiesofthe plantwere investigated by elementalanalysisofleavesandsoil. For this. the methods of sampling. sample preparation and sample were used according to GOST RF. The analysis of the main chemical components in the leaf and soil samples was carried out using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometerand an atomic absorption spectrometer. The analysis of micro-components in the leaf and soil samples was carried out using an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. It was found that there is a strong correlation between the degree of environmental pollution and the level of developmental stability of morphological characters of Quercus castaneifolia CA Mey.

In Brazil. there’sa few data available on the microscopic description of starch. so this work aimed to analyze morphologically the starch granules in popular sources of starch obtained in specialized stores. markets. and fairs of three municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro and develop an identification key of them. The samples was analyzed by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Falsifications were found in three arrowroot flours of different brands and origins. Consequently. it reflects the contribution of starch granules microscopy analysis to indicate the importance of legitimate cultivation of arrowroot and other traditional crops of the Brazilian flora. Spherical. polyhedral and ovoid granules are frequent in the species studied. with round-triangular and campanulate granules specific for identifying false-arrowroot and cassava. respectively.

It is involved in cell growth. development. and tumor biology. However. the function of CD133 at the organismal level has not been investigated. In this study. we found that prominin-like (promL) loss-of-function mutant flies show an extended life span and metabolic defects such as increased circulating carbohydrates. lipid storage. and starvation resistance. The messenger RNA expression levels of Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) were reduced in loss-of-function promL mutants. Furthermore. the level of phosphorylated AKT. a downstream component of insulin signaling. was lower in promL loss-of-function mutants than in the w− control flies. Importantly. the PromL protein is predominantly expressed in the pars intercerebralis region with insulin-producing cells of the adult brain. When we inhibited promL in insulin-producing cells …,True,Pwe_ueoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article-abstract/74/10/1557/5261367,16591647908989292041,/scholar?cites=16591647908989292041,,,0,0,0

However. the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here. we show that Dilp8. a Drosophila homologue of mammalian insulin-like 3 peptide (INSL3). is secreted from tumour tissues and induces anorexia through the Lgr3 receptor in the brain. Activated Dilp8-Lgr3 signalling upregulated anorexigenic nucleobinding 1 (NUCB1) and downregulated orexigenic short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and NPF expression in the brain. In the cancer condition. the protein expression of Lgr3 and NUCB1 was significantly upregulated in neurons expressing sNPF and NPF. INSL3 levels were increased in tumour-implanted mice and INSL3-treated mouse hypothalamic cells showed Nucb2 upregulation and Npy downregulation. Food consumption was significantly reduced in intracerebrospinal INSL3-injected mice …,True,Pwe_ueoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-020-00628-z,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-020-00628-z,0,0,0

1090862,Analysis of leukocyte behaviors on microfluidic chips,2019,Yan Liu and Qingzhen Yang and Lei Cao and Feng Xu,8,,4,1801406,,The orchestration of massive leukocytes in the immune system protects humans from invading pathogens and abnormal cells in the body. So far. researches focusing on leukocyte behaviors are performed based on both in vivo and in vitro models. The in vivo animal models are usually less controllable due to their extreme complexity and nonignorable species issue. Therefore. many researchers turn to in vitro models. With the advances in micro/nanofabrication. the microfluidic chip has emerged as a novel platform for model construction in multiple biomedical research fields. Specifically. the microfluidic chip is used to study leukocyte behaviors. due to its incomparable advantages in high throughput. precise control. and flexible integration. Moreover. the small size of the microstructures on the microfluidic chip can better mimic the native microenvironment of leukocytes. which contributes to a more reliable …,True,GeS3EOkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.201801406,13650107198116579842,/scholar?cites=13650107198116579842,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lei_Cao31/publication/330583892_Analysis_of_Leukocyte_Behaviors_on_Microfluidic_Chips/links/5dc50903a6fdcc2d2ffbfb2f/Analysis-of-Leukocyte-Behaviors-on-Microfluidic-Chips.pdf,0,0,0
