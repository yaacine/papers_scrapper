1090628,Layered graphene/GaS van der Waals heterostructure: controlling the electronic properties and Schottky barrier by vertical strain,2018,Khang D Pham and Nguyen N Hieu and Huynh V Phuc and IA Fedorov and CA Duque and B Amin and Chuong V Nguyen,113,Applied Physics Letters,17,171605,AIP Publishing LLC,In this work. we construct an ultrathin graphene/GaS heterostructure and investigate its electronic properties as well as the effect of vertical strain using density functional theory. The calculated results of the equilibrium interlayer spacing (3.356 Å) and the binding energy show that the intrinsic properties of isolated graphene and GaS monolayers can be preserved and the weak van der Waals interactions are dominated in the heterostructures. The van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) forms an n-type Schottky contact with a small Schottky barrier height of 0.51 eV. This small Schottky barrier height can also be tuned by applying vertical strain. Furthermore. we find that the n-type Schottky contact of the vdWH can be changed to p-type when the interlayer spacing is decreased and exceeded to 2.60 Å. These findings show the great potential application of the graphene/GaS vdWH for designing next generation devices.,True,JJg8ka8AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,118,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5055616,17028300398720863887,/scholar?cites=17028300398720863887,,,0,0,0

The magneto-optical absorption coefficient (MOAC) is investigated as a function of the incident photon energy when carriers are scattered by three different types of phonons: the intrinsic MoS 2 acoustic. optical phonons. and the surface optical (SO) phonons induced by polar substrates. Among the substrates considered. the largest magnitude of MOAC and full-width at half maximum (FWHM) are observed for a SiO 2 substrate over the entire temperature and magnetic field range considered due to its strongest electron-SO phonon scattering. while an h-BN substrate displays the lowest one.

In addition. we demonstrate that the absorption begins in the visible region. While the absorption edge remains visible region under the effect of compression strain. the tensile strain leads to shifting the absorption edge to the near infrared region.

The interlayer distance between graphene and topmost phosphorene is 3.50 Å and the binding energy per carbon atom is 28.2 meV. which is indicated that graphene is bound to phosphorene via vdW interaction. The appearance of an energy gap of 33 meV in graphene is due to the dominant influence exerted by the phosphorene on graphene and sublattice symmetry broken between graphene and substrate. The G/P heterostructure forms a p-type Schottky contact with Φ B p= 0.34 eV. By applying the negative electric field. the G/P heterostructure keeps a p-type Schottky contact. Whereas with the positive electric field of E≥+ 0.25 V/Å. Φ B p becomes larger than Φ B n. resulting in a transformation from p-type to n-type Schottky contact.

Our calculations show that weak van derpp Waals interactions between graphene and monolayer MoS 2 are dominated at the interlayer distance of 3.34 Å and the binding energy per C atom of− 25.1 meV. A narrow band gap of 3.6 meV has opened in G/MoS 2 heterointerface. and it can be modulated by the out-plane strain. Furthermore. the Schottky barrier and Schottky contact types in the G/MoS 2 heterointerface can be controlled by the out-plane strain. At the equilibrium state (d= 3.34 Å). the intrinsic electronic structure of G/MoS 2 heterointerface is well preserved and forms an n-type Schottky barrier of 0.49 eV.

The stability of the doped models is investigated based on the formation energies. where the substitutional doping is found to be energetically more stable under O-rich conditions than under Bi-rich ones. The results showed that substitutional doping of P atoms reduced the bandgap of pristine BiOBr to a greater extent than that of boron substitution. The calculation of the effective masses reveals that B doping can render the electrons and holes of pristine BiOBr lighter and heavier. respectively. resulting in a slower recombination rate of photoexcited electron–hole pairs.

Our calculated results indicate that the single-layer SnSe2 is a semiconductor with a small band gap of 0.715 eV at the equilibrium state.

While these attributes are difficult to achieve by conventional methods. we have successfully demonstrated the matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) deposition of thin films of especially synthesized fluoro-alcohol substituted carbo-polysiloxane polymer coatings. The quadrupled output of a Nd:YAG laser (265 nm) served as the laser source and depositions were done in a background pressure of N2.
