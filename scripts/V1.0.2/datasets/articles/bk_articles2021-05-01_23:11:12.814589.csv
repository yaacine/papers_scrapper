1276837,A survey of program slicing techniques,1994,Frank Tip,,,,,Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica,A program slice consists of the parts of a program that (potentially) affect the values computed at some point of interest. Such a point of interest is referred to as a slicing criterion. and is typically specified by a location in the program in combination with a subset of the program’s variables. The task of computing program slices is called program slicing. The original definition of a program slice was presented by Weiser in 1979. Since then. various slightly different notions of program slices have been proposed. as well as a number of methods to compute them. An important distinction is that between a static and a dynamic slice. Static slices are computed without making assumptions regarding a program’s input. whereas the computation of dynamic slices relies on a specific test case. This survey presents an overview of program slicing. including the various general approaches used to compute slices. as well as the specific techniques used to address a variety of language features such as procedures. unstructured control flow. composite data types and pointers. and concurrency. Static and dynamic slicing methods for each of these features are compared and classified in terms of their accuracy and efficiency. Moreover. the possibilities for combining solutions for different features are investigated. Recent work on the use of compiler-optimization and symbolic execution techniques for obtaining more accurate slices is discussed.

Chianti analyzes two versions of an application and decomposes their difference into a set of atomic changes. Change impact is then reported in terms of affected (regression or unit) tests whose execution behavior may have been modified by the applied changes. For each affected test. Chianti also determines a set of affecting changes that were responsible for the test's modified behavior. This latter step of isolating the changes that induce the failure of one specific test from those changes that only affect other tests can be used as a debugging technique in situations where a test fails unexpectedly after a long editing session. We evaluated Chianti on a year (2002) of CVS data from M.

1276840,Scalable propagation-based call graph construction algorithms,2000,Frank Tip and Jens Palsberg,,,,281-293,,Propagation-based call graph construction algorithms have been studied intensively in the 199Os. and differ primarily in the number of sets that are used to approximate run-time values of expressions. In practice. algorithms such as RTA that use a single set for the whole program scale well. The scalability of algorithms such as 0-CFA that use one set per expression remains doubtful. In this paper. we investigate the design space between RTA and 0-CFA. We have implemented various novel algorithms in the context of Jax. an application extractor for Java. and shown that they all scale to a 325.000-line program. A key property of these algorithms is that they do not analyze values on the run-time stack. which makes them efficient and easy to implement. Surprisingly. for detecting unreachable methods. the inexpensive RTA algorithm does almost as well as the seemingly more powerful algorithms.

This complicates life for maintenance programmers. who need to fix bugs or add enhancements to systems originally written by others. Change impact analysis provides feedback on the semantic impact of a set of program changes. This analysis can be used to determine the regression test drivers that are affected by a set of changes.

Their absence is not guaranteed by the traditional notion of ""data race"" freedom. We present a new definition of data races in terms of 11 problematic interleaving scenarios. and prove that it is complete by showing that any execution not exhibiting these scenarios is serializable for a chosen set of locations. Our definition subsumes the traditional definition of a data race as well as high-level data races such as stale-value errors and inconsistent views. We also propose a language feature called atomic sets of locations. which lets programmers specify the existence of consistency properties between fields in objects. without specifying the properties themselves.

1276843,Reengineering class hierarchies using concept analysis,1998,Gregor Snelting and Frank Tip,23,ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes,6,99-110,ACM,The design of a class hierarchy may be imperfect. For example. a class C may contain a member m not accessed in any C-instance. an indication that m could be eliminated. or moved into a derived class. Furthermore. different subsets of C's members may be accessed from different C-instances. indicating that it might be appropriate to split C into multiple classes. We present a framework for detecting and remediating such design problems. which is based on concept analysis.

1276844,A framework for automated testing of JavaScript web applications,2011,Shay Artzi and Julian Dolby and Simon Holm Jensen and Anders Møller and Frank Tip,,,,571-580,,Current practice in testing JavaScript web applications requires manual construction of test cases. which is difficult and tedious. We present a framework for feedback-directed automated test generation for JavaScript in which execution is monitored to collect information that directs the test generator towards inputs that yield increased coverage. We implemented several instantiations of the framework. corresponding to variations on feedback-directed random testing. in a tool called Artemis. Experiments on a suite of JavaScript applications demonstrate that a simple instantiation of the framework that uses event handler registrations as feedback information produces surprisingly good coverage if enough tests are generated. By also using coverage information and read-write sets as feedback information. a slightly better level of coverage can be achieved. and sometimes with many fewer tests.

In Java's standard libraries. for example. class Hashtable has been superseded by HashMap. and Iterator is now preferred over Enumeration. Migrating client applications to use the new idioms is often desirable. but making the required changes to declarations and allocation sites can be quite labor-intensive. Moreover. migration becomes complicated---and sometimes impossible---if an application interacts with external components. if a legacy class is not completely equivalent to its replacement. or if multiple interdependent classes must be migrated simultaneously.

Exhaustive techniques use model checking with explicit or symbolic execution to explore all the possible test sequences up to predefined input sizes. Lossy techniques rely on abstraction mappings to compute and store abstract versions of the concrete states; they explore underapproximations of all the possible test sequences.

1276881,An economic analysis of fertility,1960,Gary S Becker,,,,209-240,Columbia University Press,THE inability of demographers to predict western birth rates accurately in the postwar period has had a salutary influence on demographic research. Most predictions had been based either on simple extrapolations of past trends or on extrapolations that adjusted for changes in the age-sex-marital composition of the population. Socio-economic considerations are entirely absent from the former and are primitive and largely implicit in the latter. As long as even crude extrapolations continued to give fairly reliable predictions. as they did during the previous half century. there was little call for complicated analyses of the interrelation between socio-economic variables and fertility. However. the sharp decline in birth rates during the thirties coupled with the sharp rise in rates during the postwar period swept away confidence in the view that future rates could be predicted from a secularly declining function of population compositions.Maithus could with some justification assume that fertility was deter-mined primarily by two primitive variables. age at marriage and the frequency of coition during marriage. The development and spread of knowledge about contraceptives during the last century greatly widened the scope of family size decision-making. and contemporary researchers have been forced to pay greater attention to decision-making than either Maithus or the forecasters did. Psychologists have tried to place these decisions within a framework suggested by psychological theory; sociologists have tried one suggested by sociological theory. but most persons would admit that neither framework has been particularly successful in organizing the …,True,fncdDA4AAAAJ:xpFxhiwfz1QC,4483,https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c2387/c2387.pdf,17062543267500555553,/scholar?cites=17062543267500555553,,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c2387/c2387.pdf,0,0,0

Fakultät für Informatik,This report introduces the Palladio Component Model (PCM). a novel software component model for business information systems. which is specifically tuned to enable model-driven quality-of-service (QoS. ie. performance and reliability) predictions (based on work previously published in [1. 2. 3. 4. 5]). The PCM’s goal is to assess the expected response times. throughput. and resource utilization of component-based software architectures during early development stages. This shall avoid costly redesigns. which might occur after a poorly designed architecture has been implemented. Software architects should be enabled to analyse different architectural design alternatives and to support their design decisions with quantitative results from performance or reliability analysis tools. Component-based software engineering (CBSE)[6] promises many advantages over object-oriented or procedural development approaches. Besides increased reusability. better preparation for evolution. higher quality due to increased testing. and shorter time-to-market. CBSE potentially offers better predictability for the properties of architectures. because individual components should be provided with more detailed specifications.

1276887,Towards an engineering approach to component adaptation,2006,Steffen Becker and Antonio Brogi and Ian Gorton and Sven Overhage and Alexander Romanovsky and Massimo Tivoli,,,,193-215,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Component adaptation needs to be taken into account when developing trustworthy systems. where the properties of component assemblies have to be reliably obtained from the properties of its constituent components. Thus. a more systematic approach to component adaptation is required when building trustworthy systems. In this paper. we illustrate how (design and architectural) patterns can be used to achieve component adaptation and thus serve as the basis for such an approach. The paper proposes an adaptation model which is built upon a classification of component mismatches. and identifies a number of patterns to be used for eliminating them. We conclude by outlining an engineering approach to component adaptation that relies on the use of patterns and provides additional support for the development of trustworthy component-based systems.,True,fncdDA4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,137,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11786160_11,881449255607994743,/scholar?cites=881449255607994743,,,https://assets.cs.ncl.ac.uk/TRs/939.pdf,0,0,0

1276910,Design recovery by automated search for structural design patterns in object-oriented software,1996,Christian Kramer and Lutz Prechelt,,,,208-215,IEEE,The object-oriented design community has recently begun to collect so-called design patterns: cliches plus hints to their recommended use in software construction. The structural design patterns Adapter. Bridge. Composite. Decorator. and Proxy represent packaged problem/context/solution/properties descriptions to common problems in object-oriented design. Localizing instances of these patterns in existing software produced without explicit use of patterns can improve the maintainability of software. In the authors' approach. called the Pat system. design information is extracted directly from C++ header files and stored in a repository. The patterns are expressed as PROLOG rules and the design information is translated into facts. A single PROLOG query is then used to search for all patterns.

Proben1 contains 15 data sets from 12 different domains. All datasets represent realistic problems which could be called diagnosis tasks and all but one consist of real world data. The datasets are all presented in the same simple format. using an attribute representation that can directly be used for neural network training. Along with the datasets. Proben1 defines a set of rules for how to conduct and how to document neural network benchmarking. The purpose of the problem and rule collection is to give researchers easy access to data for the evaluation of their algorithms and networks and to make direct comparison of the published results feasible.

Recent work in network security has focused on the fact that combinations of exploits are the typical means by which an attacker breaks into a network. Researchers have proposed a variety of graph-based algorithms to generate attack trees (or graphs). Either structure represents all possible sequences of exploits. where any given exploit can take advantage of the penetration achieved by prior exploits in its chain. and the final exploit in the chain achieves the attacker's goal. The most recent approach in this line of work uses a modified version of the model checker NuSMV as a powerful inference engine for chaining together network exploits. compactly representing attack graphs. and identifying minimal sets of exploits.

We define syntactic operators. each of which produces a slight variation on a given model. The operators define a form of mutation analysis at the level of the model checker specification. A model checker generates countersamples which distinguish the variations from the original specification. The countersamples can easily be turned into complete test cases. that is. with inputs and expected results. We define two classes of operators: those that produce test cases from which a correct implementation must differ. and those that produce test cases with which it must agree.

1277330,Addressing legal requirements in requirements engineering,2007,Paul N Otto and Annie I Antón,,,,5-14,IEEE,Legal texts. such as regulations and legislation. are playing an increasingly important role in requirements engineering and system development. Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area for research. Similarly. regulatory compliance is critical in systems that are governed by regulations and law. especially given that non-compliance can result in both financial and criminal penalties. Working with legal texts can be very challenging. however. because they contain numerous ambiguities. cross-references. domain-specific definitions. and acronyms. and are frequently amended via new regulations and case law. Requirements engineers and compliance auditors must be able to identify relevant regulations. extract requirements and other key concepts. and monitor compliance throughout the software lifecycle.

1277331,Why do people tag? Motivations for photo tagging,2010,Oded Nov and Chen Ye,53,Communications of the ACM,7,128-131,ACM,IntroductionTagging. or using keywords to add metadata to shared content. is gaining much popularity in recent years. Tags are used to annotate various types of content. including images. videos. bookmarks. and blogs. through web-based systems such as Flickr. YouTube. del.icio.us. and Technorati. respectively. The popularity of tagging is attributed. at least in part. to the benefits users gain from effective sharing and from organization of very large amounts of information.As tagging receives increasing attention in both research and business communities. studies have found that users vary substantially in their tag usage. and suggested several factors that motivate user tagging. However. to date no quantitative study has assessed the strength of the effects of each motivation on levels of tag usage.

1277333,Data flow analysis in software reliability,1976,Lloyd D Fosdick and Leon J Osterweil,8,,3,305-330,ACM,The ways that the methods of data flow analysis can be applied to improve software reliability are described. There is also a review of the basic terminology from graph theory and from data flow analysis in global program optimization. The notation of regular expressions is used to describe actions on data for sets of paths. These expressions provide the basis of a classification scheme for data flow which represents patterns of data flow along paths within subprograms and along paths which cross subprogram boundaries. Fast algorithms. originally introduced for global optimization. are described and it is shown how they can be used to implement the classification scheme. It is then shown how these same algorithms can also be used to detect the presence of data flow anomalies which are symptomatic of programming errors.

A key originality of this work is that our demand-driven compositional interprocedural symbolic execution is performed entirely using first-order logic formulas solved with an off-the-shelf SMT (Satisfiability-Modulo-Theories) solver – no procedure in-lining or custom algorithm is required for the interprocedural part.

Parameterized unit tests separate two concerns: 1) They specify the external behavior of the involved methods for all test arguments. 2) Test cases can be re-obtained as traditional closed unit tests by instantiating the parameterized unit tests. Symbolic execution and constraint solving can be used to automatically choose a minimal set of inputs that exercise a parameterized unit test with respect to possible code paths of the implementation.

The motivation for this research is to quantitatively investigate common perceptions about open-source projects. and to validate these perceptions through an empirical study. We investigate the hypothesis that open-source software grows more quickly. but does not find evidence to support this. The project growth is similar for all the projects in the analysis. indicating that other factors may limit growth.

1277359,A case study on the impact of refactoring on quality and productivity in an agile team,2007,Raimund Moser and Pekka Abrahamsson and Witold Pedrycz and Alberto Sillitti and Giancarlo Succi,,,,252-266,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Refactoring is a hot and controversial issue. Supporters claim that it helps increasing the quality of the code. making it easier to understand. modify and maintain. Moreover. there are also claims that refactoring yields higher development productivity – however. there is only limited empirical evidence of such assumption. A case study has been conducted to assess the impact of refactoring in a close-to industrial environment. Results indicate that refactoring not only increases aspects of software quality. but also improves productivity. Our findings are applicable to small teams working in similar. highly volatile domains (ours is application development for mobile devices). However. additional research is needed to ensure that this is indeed true and to generalize it to other contexts.,True,PdMO57sAAAAJ:tHtfpZlB6tUC,146,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85279-7_20,2323442108857098293,/scholar?cites=2323442108857098293,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-85279-7_20.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we are concerned with a fuzzy set-based generalization of the COCOMO model (f-COCOMO). The inputs of the standard COCOMO model include an estimation of project size and an evaluation of other parameters. Rather than using a single number. the software size can be regarded as a fuzzy set (fuzzy number) yielding the cost estimate also in form of a fuzzy set. The paper includes detailed results with this regard by relating fuzzy sets of project size with the fuzzy set of effort. The analysis is carried out for several commonly encountered classes of membership functions (such as triangular and parabolic fuzzy sets). The issue of designer-friendliness of the f-COCOMO model is discussed in detail.

Accurate failure predictions can help in mitigating the impact of failures. Resources. applications. and services can be scheduled to limit the impact of failures. However. providing accurate predictions sufficiently ahead is challenging. Log files contain messages that represent a change of system state. A sequence or a pattern of messages may be used to predict failures.We describe an approach to predict failures based on log files using Random Indexing (RI) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).RI is applied to represent sequences: each operation is characterized in terms of its context. SVMs associate sequences to a class of failures or non-failures.

1277367,Food recognition using statistics of pairwise local features,2010,Shulin Yang and Mei Chen and Dean Pomerleau and Rahul Sukthankar,,,,2249-2256,IEEE,Food recognition is difficult because food items are de-formable objects that exhibit significant variations in appearance. We believe the key to recognizing food is to exploit the spatial relationships between different ingredients (such as meat and bread in a sandwich). We propose a new representation for food items that calculates pairwise statistics between local features computed over a soft pixel-level segmentation of the image into eight ingredient types. We accumulate these statistics in a multi-dimensional histogram. which is then used as a feature vector for a discriminative classifier. Our experiments show that the proposed representation is significantly more accurate at identifying food than existing methods.,True,PheAOKEAAAAJ:jOyC0gq838wC,286,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5539907/,17697439621067520982,/scholar?cites=17697439621067520982,,,http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~rahuls/pub/cvpr2010-food-rahuls.pdf,0,0,0

When a new bug report is submitted to the repository. a person. called a triager. examines whether it is a duplicate of an existing bug report. If it is. the triager marks it as DUPLICATE and the bug report is removed from consideration for further work. In the literature. there are approaches exploiting only natural language information to detect duplicate bug reports. In this paper we present a new approach that further involves execution information. In our approach. when a new bug report arrives. its natural language information and execution information are compared with those of the existing bug reports.

Due to the imprecision of retrieved connections. we use a static representation of the source code named BRCG (branch-reserving call graph) to further recover both relevant and specific computational units for each feature.

Coverage-based test case prioritization techniques typically use one of two overall strategies: a total strategy or an additional strategy.

To effectively store these data. a data manager must intelligently select data centres in which these data will reside. This is. however. not the case for data which must have a fixed location.

Specifically. the service-level scheduling deals with the Task-to-Service assignment where tasks of individual workflow instances are mapped to cloud services in the global cloud markets based on their functional and non-functional QoS requirements; the task-level scheduling deals with the optimisation of the Task-to-VM (virtual machine) assignment in local cloud data centres …,True,YTDQzfsAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,331,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-011-0578-4,291935204095899631,/scholar?cites=291935204095899631,,,https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/picture/article/2443/32/9a/e69148ae413b841a37228a6df5be/bd11cc93-7e68-4c46-8d45-e2ac334532d7.pdf,0,0,0

However. a major obstacle in the practice of web-based instruction is the limited understanding of learners’ characteristics and perceptions about technology use. Thus there is a need to understand the relationship between students’ learning styles and their preferences for instructional strategies. including the use of emerging web technologies. Since learning styles provide information about individual differences in learning preferences they can suggest how instruction can be best designed to support the learning preferences. In this paper. a research framework has been proposed to incorporate emerging web technologies into higher education based on students’ learning styles and technology preferences and a case study has been carried out to validate the proposed framework.

Cloud computing has many unique advantages which can be utilized to facilitate workflow execution. Instance-intensive cost-constrained cloud workflows are workflows with a large number of workflow instances (i.e. instance intensive) bounded by a certain budget for execution (i.e. cost constrained) on a cloud computing platform (i.e. cloud workflows). However. there are. so far. no dedicated scheduling algorithms for instance-intensive cost-constrained cloud workflows.

Existing works on workflow scheduling in the context of Clouds are either on deadline or cost optimization. ignoring the necessity for robustness. Robust scheduling that handles performance variations of Cloud resources and failures in the environment is essential in the context of Clouds. In this paper. we present a robust scheduling algorithm with resource allocation policies that schedule workflow tasks on heterogeneous Cloud resources while trying to minimize the total elapsed time (make span) and the cost. Our results show that the proposed resource allocation policies provide robust and fault-tolerant schedule while minimizing make span. The results also show that with the increase in budget. our policies increase the robustness of the schedule.,True,YTDQzfsAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC,145,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6838754/,18389557421047946815,/scholar?cites=18389557421047946815,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.431.3364&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Its correctness is critical to the workflow execution and hence the realisation of business objectives. In addition to structural and temporal constraints. resource constraints are also implied in workflow specifications. Therefore. they should be analysed to ensure that the workflow specification is resource consistent at build-time. In this paper. we first identify the problem of resource constraints in a workflow specification. Then we propose an innovative approach with corresponding algorithms to the checking of resource consistency for a workflow specification.

The selection of services with the aim to fulfil the quality constraints becomes critical and challenging to the success of SBSs. especially when the quality constraints are stringent.

The main focus is to provide a method for software reliability modeling. which considers both testing-effort and change-point. In the vast literature. most researchers assume a constant detection rate per fault in deriving their software reliability models. They suppose that all faults have equal probability of being detected during the software testing process. and the rate remains constant over the intervals between fault occurrences. In reality. the fault detection rate strongly depends on the skill of test teams. program size. and software testability. Therefore. it may not be smooth and can be changed. On the other hand. sometimes we have to detect more additional faults in order to reach the desired reliability objective during testing.

SRGM proposed in the literature consider the amount of testing-effort spent on software testing which can be depicted as an exponential curve. a Rayleigh curve. or a Weibull curve.

1277409,Towards operational measures of computer security,1993,Bev Littlewood and Sarah Brocklehurst and Norman Fenton and Peter Mellor and Stella Page and David Wright and John Dobson and John McDermid and Dieter Gollmann,2,Journal of computer security,2-3,211-229,IOS Press,Ideally. a measure of the security of a system should capture quantitatively the intuitive notion of ‘the ability of the system to resist attack’. That is. it should be operational. reflecting the degree to which the system can be expected to remain free of security breaches under particular conditions of operation (including attack). Instead. current security levels at best merely reflect the extensiveness of safeguards introduced during the design and development of a system. Whilst we might expect a system developed to a higher level than another to exhibit ‘more secure behaviour’in operation. this cannot be guaranteed; more particularly. we cannot infer what the actual security behaviour will be from knowledge of such a level. In the paper we discuss similarities between reliability and security with the intention of working towards measures of ‘operational security’similar to those that we have for reliability of systems.

1277411,An automated framework for structural test-data generation,1998,Nigel Tracey and John Clark and Keith Mander and John McDermid,,,,285-288,IEEE,Structural testing criteria are mandated in many software development standards and guidelines. The process of generating test data to achieve 100% coverage of a given structural coverage metric is labour-intensive and expensive. This paper presents an approach to automate the generation of such test data. The test-data generation is based on the application of a dynamic optimisation-based search for the required test data. The same approach can be generalised to solve other test-data generation problems. Three such applications are discussed-boundary value analysis. assertion/run-time exception testing. and component re-use testing. A prototype tool-set has been developed to facilitate the automatic generation of test data for these structural testing problems.

The approach is based on the application of a dynamic global optimization based search for the required test‐data. The authors' work has focused on test‐data generation for safety‐critical systems.

1277420,Information retrieval: Data structures & algorithms,2004,William B Frakes,,,,,,In the not-so-long ago past. information retrieval meant going to the town's library and asking the librarian for help. The librarian usually knew all the books in his possession. and could give one a definite. although often negative. answer. As the number of books grew--and with them the number of libraries and librarians--it became impossible for one person or any group of persons to possess so much information. Tools for information retrieval had to be devised. The most important of these tools is the index--a collection of terms with pointers to places where information about them can be found. The terms can be subject matters. author names. call numbers. etc.. but the structure of the index is essentially the same. Indexes are usually placed at the end of a book. or in another form. implemented as card catalogs in a library. The Sumerian literary catalogue. of c. 2000 BC. is probably the first list of books ever written. Book indexes had appeared in a primitive form in the 16th century. and by the 18th century some were similar to today's indexes. Given the incredible technology advances in the last 200 years. it is quite surprising that today. for the vast majority of people. an index. or a hierarchy of indexes. is still the only available tool for information retrieval! Furthermore. at least from my experience. many book indexes are not of high quality. Writing a good index is still more a matter of experience and art than a precise science.Why do most people still use 18th century technology today? It is not because there are no other methods or no new technology. I believe that the main reason is simple: Indexes work.

Android’s application model is designed to encourage applications to share their code and data with other applications. While such sharing can be tightly controlled with permissions. in general users cannot determine what applications will do with their data. and thereby cannot decide what permissions such applications should run with. In this paper we present SCANDROID. a tool for reasoning automatically about the security of Android applications. SCANDROID’s analysis is modular to allow incremental checking of applications as they are installed on an Android device. It extracts security specifications from manifests that accompany such applications. and checks whether data flows through those applications are consistent with those specifications.

In recent years. many tools and techniques have been developed for automatically finding bugs by analyzing source code or intermediate code statically (at compile time). Different tools and techniques have different tradeoffs. but the practical impact of these tradeoffs is not well understood. In this paper. we apply five bug finding tools. specifically Bandera. ESC/Java 2. FindBugs. JLint. and PMD. to a variety of Java programs. By using a variety of tools. we are able to cross-check their bug reports and warnings. Our experimental results show that none of the tools strictly subsumes another. and indeed the tools often find nonoverlapping bugs.

Earlier statistical algorithms that focus solely on identifying predictors that correlate with program failure perform poorly when there are multiple bugs. Our new technique separates the effects of different bugs and identifies predictors that are associated with individual bugs. These predictors reveal both the circumstances under which bugs occur as well as the frequencies of failure modes. making it easier to prioritize debugging efforts.

An error trace produced by a model checker can be lengthy and is indicative of a symptom of an error. As a result. users can spend considerable time examining an error trace in order to understand the cause of the error. Moreover. even state-of-the-art model checkers provide an experience akin to that provided by parsers before syntactic error recovery was invented: they report a single error trace per run. The user has to fix the error and run the model checker again to find more error traces. We present an algorithm that exploits the existence of correct traces in order to localize the error cause in an error trace. report a single error trace per error cause. and generate multiple error traces having independent causes.

The full realization of this potential is hindered by a mismatch between how individual mobile devices demand computing resources and how cloud providers offer them: offloading requests from a mobile device usually require quick response. may be infrequent. and are subject to variable network connectivity. whereas cloud resources incur relatively long setup times. are leased for long time quanta. and are indifferent to network connectivity.

1277468,Composition patterns: An approach to designing reusable aspects,2001,Siobhán Clarke and Robert J Walker,,,,0005-0005,IEEE Computer Society,Requirements such as distribution or tracing have an impact on multiple classes in a system. They are cross-cutting requirements. or aspects. Their support is. by necessity. scattered across those multiple classes. A look at an individual class may also show support for cross-cutting requirements tangled up with the core responsibilities of that class. Scattering and tangling make object-oriented software difficult to understand. extend and reuse. Though design is an important activity within the software lifecycle with well-documented benefits. those benefits are reduced when cross-cutting requirements are present. This paper presents a means to mitigate these problems by separating the design of cross-cutting requirements into composition patterns. Composition patterns require extensions to the UML. and are based on a combination of the subjectoriented model for composing separate. overlapping designs. and UML templates. This paper also demonstrates how composition patterns map to one programming model that provides a solution for separation of cross-cutting requirements in code—aspect-oriented programming.

Although progress has been made in the area of frameworks and toolkits for contextawareness. there is still a need for middleware that supports higher-level context abstractions and is both flexible and extensible in its treatment of context. CASS (Context-awareness sub-structure) is serverbased middleware intended to support contextaware applications on hand-held and other small mobile computers. CASS enables developers to overcome the memory and processor constraints of small mobile computer platforms while supporting a large number of low-level sensor and other context inputs. A key feature of CASS is its support for high-level context data abstraction and the separation of context based inferences and behaviours from application code.

The structural mismatch happens because the units of interest during the requirements phase (for example. feature. service. capability. function. etc.) are different to the units of interest during object-oriented design and implementation (for example. object. class. method. etc.).

Berlin. Heidelberg,Self-adaptation is typically realized using a control loop. One prominent approach for organizing a control loop in self-adaptive systems is by means of four components that are responsible for the primary functions of self-adaptation: Monitor. Analyze. Plan. and Execute. together forming a MAPE loop. When systems are large. complex. and heterogeneous. a single MAPE loop may not be sufficient for managing all adaptation in a system. so multiple MAPE loops may be introduced. In self-adaptive systems with multiple MAPE loops. decisions about how to decentralize each of the MAPE functions must be made. These decisions involve how and whether the corresponding functions from multiple loops are to be coordinated (e.g.. planning components coordinating to prepare a plan for an adaptation).

Prior research has primarily focused on either unit or GUI testing of Android apps. but not their end-to-end system testing in a systematic manner. We present EvoDroid. an evolutionary approach for system testing of Android apps. EvoDroid overcomes a key shortcoming of using evolutionary techniques for system testing. ie. the inability to pass on genetic makeup of good individuals in the search. To that end. EvoDroid combines two novel techniques:(1) an Android-specific program analysis technique that identifies the segments of the code amenable to be searched independently. and (2) an evolutionary algorithm that given information of such segments performs a step-wise search for test cases reaching deep into the code.

Such systems typically employ analytical models specified at design-time to assess their characteristics at run-time and make the appropriate adaptation decisions. However. prior to system's deployment. engineers often cannot foresee the changes in the environment. requirements. and system's operational profile. Therefore. any analytical model used in this setting relies on underlying assumptions that if not held at run-time make the analysis and hence the adaptation decisions inaccurate.

Heidelberg,It is commonly agreed that a self-adaptive software system is one that can modify itself at run-time due to changes in the system. its requirements. or the environment in which it is deployed. A cursory review of the software engineering literature attests to the wide spectrum of software systems that are described as self-adaptive. The way self-adaptation is conceived depends on various aspects. such as the users’ requirements. the particular properties of a system. and the characteristics of the environment. In this paper. we propose a classification of modeling dimensions for self-adaptive software systems. Each modeling dimension describes a particular facet of the system that is relevant to self-adaptation.

A critical challenge is the systematic generation of test cases. One method of systematically generating test cases for Java programs is symbolic execution. But applying symbolic execution tools. such as Symbolic Pathfinder (SPF). to generate test cases for Android apps is challenged by the fact that Android apps run on the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) instead of JVM. In addition. Android apps are event driven and susceptible to path-divergence due to their reliance on an application development framework. This paper provides an overview of a two-pronged approach to alleviate these issues.

1277501,Scalable propagation-based call graph construction algorithms,2000,Frank Tip and Jens Palsberg,,,,281-293,,Propagation-based call graph construction algorithms have been studied intensively in the 199Os. and differ primarily in the number of sets that are used to approximate run-time values of expressions. In practice. algorithms such as RTA that use a single set for the whole program scale well. The scalability of algorithms such as 0-CFA that use one set per expression remains doubtful. In this paper. we investigate the design space between RTA and 0-CFA. We have implemented various novel algorithms in the context of Jax. an application extractor for Java. and shown that they all scale to a 325.000-line program. A key property of these algorithms is that they do not analyze values on the run-time stack. which makes them efficient and easy to implement. Surprisingly. for detecting unreachable methods. the inexpensive RTA algorithm does almost as well as the seemingly more powerful algorithms.

1277503,The essence of the visitor pattern,1998,Jens Palsberg and C Barry Jay,,,,9-15,IEEE,For object-oriented programming. the Visitor pattern enables the definition of a new operation on an object structure without changing the classes of the objects. The price has been that the set of classes must be fixed in advance. and they must each have a so-called accept method. In this paper we demonstrate how to program visitors without relying on accept methods and without knowing all classes of the objects in advance. The idea. derived from related work on shape polymorphism in functional programming. is to separate (1) accessing subobjects. and (2) acting on them. In the object-oriented setting. reflection techniques support access to sub-objects. as demonstrated in our Java class. Walkabout. It supports all visitors as subclasses. and they can be programmed without any further use of reflection. Thus a program using the Visitor pattern can now be understood as a specialized version of a program using …,True,Gx8Rpr4AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,240,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/716629/,18120099239949220997,/scholar?cites=18120099239949220997,,,https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/vkp/3500-fl13/TheEssenceoftheVisitorPattern.pdf,0,0,0

Collberg and C. Thomborsen (1999). The new idea is to embed a watermark in dynamic data structures. thereby protecting against many program-transformation attacks. Until now there have been no reports on practical experience with this technique. We have implemented and experimented with a watermarking system for Java based on the ideas of Collberg and Thomborsen. Our experiments show that watermarking can be done efficiently with moderate increases in code size. execution times and heap-space usage. while making the watermarked code resilient to a variety of program-transformation attacks. For a particular representation of watermarks. the time to retrieve a watermark is on the order of one minute per megabyte of heap space.

1277507,Encapsulating objects with confined types,2001,Christian Grothoff and Jens Palsberg and Jan Vitek,,,,241-255,,Object-oriented languages provide little support for encapsulating objects. Reference semantics allows objects to escape their defining scope. The pervasive aliasing that ensues remains a major source of software defects. This paper introduces Kacheck/J a tool for inferring object encapulation properties in large Java programs. Our goal is to develop practical tools to assist software engineers. thus we focus on simple and scalable techniques. Kacheck/J is able to infer confinement for Java classes. A class and its sublasses are confined if all of their instances are encapsulated in their defining package. This simple property can be used to identify accidental leaks of sensitive objects.

1277510,The essence of multilevel metamodeling,2001,Colin Atkinson and Thomas Kühne,,,,19-33,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,As the UMLattempts to make the transition from a single. albeit extensible. language to a framework for a family of languages. the nature and form of the underlying meta-modeling architecture will assume growing importance. It is generally recognized that without a simple. clean and intuitive theory of how metamodel levels are created and related to one another. the UML2.0 vision of a coherent family of languages with a common core set of concepts will remain elusive. However. no entirely satisfactory metamodeling approach has yet been found. Current (meta-)modeling theories used or proposed for the UML all have at least one fundamental problem that makes them unsuitable in their present form.

As model-driven development moves to the center stage of software engineering. it is particularly important that this principle be applied to the technologies used to create and manipulate models. especially models that are intended to be free of solution decisions.

To maximize this potential. the examination of the artefact under inspection must be as thorough and detailed as possible. This implies the need for systematic reading techniques that tell inspection participants what to look for and. more importantly. how to scrutinize a software document.

However. how HDACs are involved in innate immunity is little understood. Here. in this first systematic investigation of the role of HDACs in immunity. we show that HDAC inhibition by a small-molecule HDAC inhibitor (HDACi).

Surprisingly. pan-HDAC inhibition modulates only a limited set of genes involved in distinct arms of immune responses.

One may prefer a coalition structure that maximizes the sum of the values of the coalitions. but often the number of coalition structures is too large to allow exhaustive search for the optimal one. Furthermore. finding the optimal coalition structure is NP-complete. But then. can the coalition structure found via a partial search be guaranteed to be within a bound from optimum? We show that none of the previous coalition structure generation algorithms can establish any bound because they search fewer nodes than a threshold that we show necessary for establishing a bound. We present an algorithm that establishes a tight bound within this minimal amount of search. and show that any other algorithm would have to search strictly more.

For each topic. we present an overview. suggest future directions. and focus on selected challenges. This paper complements and extends a previous roadmap on software engineering for self-adaptive systems published in 2009 covering a different set of topics. and reflecting in part on the previous paper.

The technique is named Scenario-Based Reliability Analysis (SBRA). Using scenarios of component interactions. we construct a probabilistic model named Component-Dependency Graph (CDG). Based on CDG. a reliability analysis algorithm is developed to analyze the reliability of the system as a function of reliabilities of its architectural constituents. An extension of the proposed model and algorithm is also developed for distributed software systems. The proposed approach has the following benefits: 1) It is used to analyze the impact of variations and uncertainties in the reliability of individual components. subsystems. and links between components on the overall reliability estimate of the software system.

Data miners can learn defect predictors from static code features which can be used to control QA resources; e.g. to focus on the parts of the code predicted to be more defective.Recent results show that better data mining technology is not leading to better defect predictors. We hypothesize that we have reached the limits of the standard learning goal of maximizing area under the curve (AUC) of the probability of false alarms and probability of detection “AUC(pd. pf)”; i.e. the area under the curve of a probability of false alarm versus probability of detection.Accordingly. we explore changing the standard goal.

Such prediction models are especially beneficial for large-scale systems. where verification experts need to focus their attention and resources to problem areas in the system under development. This paper presents a novel methodology for predicting fault prone modules. based on random forests. Random forests are an extension of decision tree learning. Instead of generating one decision tree. this methodology generates hundreds or even thousands of trees using subsets of the training data. Classification decision is obtained by voting. We applied random forests in five case studies based on NASA data sets.

Choosing the “best” candidate among many available models involves performance assessment and detailed comparison. but these comparisons are not simple due to the applicability of varying performance measures. Classifying a software module as fault-prone implies the application of some verification activities. thus adding to the development cost. Misclassifying a module as fault free carries the risk of system failure. also associated with cost implications. Methodologies for precise evaluation of fault prediction models should be at the core of empirical software engineering research. but have attracted sporadic attention.

The test adequacy criterion is transformed into a fitness function and a set of solutions in the search space are evaluated with respect to the fitness function using a metaheuristic search technique. The application of metaheuristic search techniques for testing is promising due to the fact that exhaustive testing is infeasible considering the size and complexity of software under test.

Most recently. research in aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) has exploited composition approaches that provide more flexible extension. adaptation and integration of components. A critical issue in composition is symmetry versus asymmetry. Most AOSD approaches have used an asymmetric paradigm. in which “aspects” are composed (woven) into components that implement a “base” model; aspects and components are different. and component-component. aspect-aspect. and class-class composition are not supported. A symmetric paradigm. on the other hand. makes no distinction between components and aspects. and does not mandate a distinguished base model.

However. static and dynamic analyses of information flow are easily challenged by non-available or obscure code. We present a lightweight mutation-based analysis that systematically mutates dynamic values returned by sensitive sources to assess whether the mutation changes the values passed to sensitive sinks. If so. we found a flow between source and sink. In contrast to existing techniques. mutation-based flow analysis does not attempt to identify the specific path of the flow and is thus resilient to obfuscation. In its evaluation. our MUTAFLOW prototype for Android programs showed that mutation-based flow analysis is a lightweight yet effective complement to existing tools.

Two interesting scenarios then arise for effective testing. In the first scenario. software engineers would like to generate inputs that are as similar as possible to the inputs in common usage of the program. to test the reliability of the program. More interesting is the second scenario where inputs should be as dissimilar as possible from normal usage. This is useful for robustness testing and exploring yet uncovered behavior. To provide test cases for both scenarios. we leverage a context-free grammar to parse a set of sample input files that represent the program's common usage. and determine probabilities for individual grammar production as they occur during parsing the inputs. Replicating these probabilities during grammar-based test input generation. we obtain inputs that are close to the samples. Inverting these probabilities yields inputs that are strongly dissimilar to common inputs. yet still valid with respect to the grammar. Our evaluation on three common input formats (JSON. JavaScript. CSS) shows the effectiveness of these approaches in obtaining instances from both sets of inputs.,True,r8T1-yoAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07525,9371990603095062768,/scholar?cites=9371990603095062768,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07525,0,0,0

The technical debt metaphor is gaining significant traction in the agile development community as a way to understand and communicate such issues. The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (eg. modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (eg. a deadline). and that such compromises incur a"" debt"": on which"" interest"" has to be paid and which the"" principal"" should be repaid at some point for the long-term health of the project.

1277635,Measuring and monitoring technical debt,2011,Carolyn Seaman and Yuepu Guo,82,,,25-46,Elsevier,Technical debt is a metaphor for immature. incomplete. or inadequate artifacts in the software development lifecycle that cause higher costs and lower quality in the long run. These artifacts remaining in a system affect subsequent development and maintenance activities. and so can be seen as a type of debt that the system developers owe the system. Incurring technical debt may speed up software development in the short run. but such benefit is achieved at the cost of extra work in the future. as if paying interest on the debt. In this sense. the technical debt metaphor characterizes the relationship between the short-term benefits of delaying certain software maintenance tasks or doing them quickly and less carefully. and the long-term cost of those delays. However. managing technical debt is more complicated than managing financial debt because of the uncertainty involved.

1277643,The art of agent-oriented modeling,2009,Leon Sterling and Kuldar Taveter,,,,,MIT Press,A new approach for conceptualizing and modeling multi-agent systems that consist of people. devices. and software agents. Today. when computing is pervasive and deployed over a range of devices by a multiplicity of users. we need to develop computer software to interact with both the ever-increasing complexity of the technical world and the growing fluidity of social organizations. The Art of Agent-Oriented Modeling presents a new conceptual model for developing software systems that are open. intelligent. and adaptive. It describes an approach for modeling complex systems that consist of people. devices. and software agents in a changing environment (sometimes known as distributed sociotechnical systems). The authors take an agent-oriented view. as opposed to the more common object-oriented approach. Thinking in terms of agents (which they define as the human and man-made components of a system). they argue. can change the way people think of software and the tasks it can perform. The book offers an integrated and coherent set of concepts and models. presenting the models at three levels of abstraction corresponding to a motivation layer (where the purpose. goals. and requirements of the system are described). a design layer. and an implementation layer. It compares platforms by implementing the same models in four different languages; compares methodologies by using a common example; includes extensive case studies; and offers exercises suitable for either class use or independent study.,True,N056eT4AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,325,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=W199SZvtIuMC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:ae20F-C9XjUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=bKI95zyw28&sig=lzLeoo5pmJwvs0SCWVDimwJJdmw,3845719901989039465,/scholar?cites=3845719901989039465,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5095/45c07f8a5894785ecce1f0745f988f55ddef.pdf,0,0,0

We argue that simpler natural animals already exhibit most of the properties required by an autonomous agent. and suggest that designers of autonomous agents should draw directly upon the neural basis of behavior in these animals. The relevant behavioral and neurobiological literature is briefly reviewed. An artificial nervous system for controlling the behavior of a simulated insect is then developed. The design of this artificial insect is based in part upon specific behaviors and neural circuits from several natural animals. The insect exhibits a number of characteristics which are remarkably reminiscent of natural animal behavior.,True,N056eT4AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,171,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092188900580034X,6969981948394563884,/scholar?cites=6969981948394563884,,,,0,0,0

We show that by adopting a monotonicity assumption of the output with respect to the input. inconsistencies among examples can be easily detected and the number of possible classification rules substantially reduced. By adopting a conservative classification criterion. the required number of rules further decreases. The monotonicity and conservatism of the classification also enable the resolution of conflicts among inconsistent examples and the graceful handling of don't knows and don't cares during the learning and classification phases.

Different components can be provided by different producers and they can be part of different systems at the same time. Moreover. components can change rapidly and independently. making it difficult to manage the whole system in a consistent way.

One approach to doing so would be to apply any of a host of existing configuration management systems. which have long been used successfully at the level of source code. Unfortunately. such an approach leads to many problems that prevent effective management of architectural evolution. To overcome these problems. we have developed an alternative approach centered on the use of an integrated architectural and configuration management system model. Because the system model combines architectural and configuration management concepts in a single representation. it has the distinct benefit that all architectural changes can be precisely captured and clearly related to each other---both at the fine-grained level of individual architectural elements and at the coarse …,True,h3L7zkoAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C,133,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1018210.1018213,7477227379237372372,/scholar?cites=7477227379237372372,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44872626/J5.pdf,0,0,0

One reason is that current debugging tools do not directly support the inquisitive nature of the activity. Interrogative Debugging is a new debugging paradigm in which programmers can ask why did and even why didn't questions directly about their program's runtime failures. The Whyline is a prototype Interrogative Debugging interface for the Alice programming environment that visualizes answers in terms of runtime events directly relevant to a programmer's question.

The Whyline is a new kind of debugging tool that avoids such speculation by instead enabling developers to select a question about program output from a set of why did and why didn't questions derived from the program's code and execution. The tool then finds one or more possible explanations for the output in question. using a combination of static and dynamic slicing. precise call graphs. and new algorithms for determining potential sources of values and explanations for why a line of code was not reached.

Unfortunately. we still know little about how and why they create these diagrams. and so there is little research to inform the design of visual tools to support developers' work. This paper presents findings from semi-structured interviews that have been validated with a structured survey. Results show that most of the diagrams had a transient nature because of the high cost of changing whiteboard sketches to electronic renderings.

Berlin. Heidelberg,The use of different modeling languages in software development makes their integration a must. Most existing integration approaches are metamodel-based with these metamodels representing both an abstract syntax of the corresponding modeling language and also a data structure for storing models. This implementation specific focus. however. does not make explicit certain language concepts. which can complicate integration tasks. Hence. we propose a process which semi-automatically lifts metamodels into ontologies by making implicit concepts in the metamodel explicit in the ontology.

While aspect-orientation originally has emerged at the programming level. it now stretches also over other development phases. There are. for example. already several proposals to Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM). most of them pursuing distinguished goals. providing different concepts as well as notations. and showing various levels of maturity. Consequently. there is an urgent need for both. academia and practice. to provide an in-depth survey. clearly identifying commonalities and differences between current AOM approaches. Existing surveys in this area focus more on comprehensibility with respect to development phases or evaluated approaches rather than on comparability at a fine-grained level.This paper tries to fill this gap. As a prerequisite for an in-depth evaluation. a conceptual reference model is presented. capturing the basic concepts of AOM and their interrelationships in terms of a UML class diagram. Based on this conceptual reference model. an evaluation framework has been designed by deriving a detailed and well-defined catalogue of evaluation criteria. The actual evaluation by means of this criteria catalogue and by employing a running example is done on the basis of a carefully selected set of eight AOM approaches. each of them having already reached a certain level of maturity. This per approach evaluation is complemented with an extensive report on lessons learned. summarizing the approaches’ strengths and shortcomings.,True,YZDY1psAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,102,https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/pub-inf_4920.pdf,4204372942584804600,/scholar?cites=4204372942584804600,,,https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/pub-inf_4920.pdf,0,0,0

This raises issues as to why do police break the law and. crucially.'who controls the controllers'? Corruption is defined in a broad. multi-facetted way. It concerns abuse of authority and trust; and it takes serious form in conspiracies to break the law and to evade exposure when cops can become criminals. Attention is paid to typologies of corruption (with grass-eaters. meat-eaters. noble-cause); the forms corruption takes in diverse environments; the pathways officers take into corruption and their rationalisations; and to collusion in corruption from within and without the organization.

Secondly. there is consensus on effective measures to tackle it and to promote integrity. Ingredients are strong leadership. a multi-faceted organisational strategy. a well-resourced internal affairs unit. proactive techniques of investigation. and persistent efforts to promote professional standards.

Chinese criminals and new patterns of drug-related crimes led policemen into arrangements with underworld figures. Types of into arrangements with underworld figures. Types of corruption exposed in the press ranged from such minor forms as leaking information. cutting administrative red tape. and accepting informal rewards (eg. discounts. gifts) to more serious. strategic forms of corruption such as stimulation of crime. extortion and graft. false testimony. intimidation of witnesses. and drug dealing. Despite the seriousness of the charges raised against a number of officers. exposure of the corruption resulted in neither convictions nor significant institutional change. In this case. deviance and the responses to it may be viewed as arising from the nature of police work. an occupational subculture that condones illicit practices and legitimates techniques of subterfuge and deceit. and an organization that explicitly stimulates deviance as a means of achieving law enforcement ends.

Because the set of faults in a program is usually unknowable. this definition is not useful to practitioners who are creating test suites. nor to researchers who are creating and evaluating tools that generate test suites. In place of real faults. testing research often uses mutants. which are artificial faults--each one a simple syntactic variation--that are systematically seeded throughout the program under test. Mutation analysis is appealing because large numbers of mutants can be automatically-generated and used to compensate for low quantities or the absence of known real faults. Unfortunately. there is little experimental evidence to support the use of mutants as a replacement for real faults.

A common scenario in software testing is therefore that test data are generated. and a tester manually adds test oracles. As this is a difficult task. it is important to produce small yet representative test sets. and this representativeness is typically measured using code coverage. There is. however. a fundamental problem with the common approach of targeting one coverage goal at a time: Coverage goals are not independent. not equally difficult. and sometimes infeasible-the result of test generation is therefore dependent on the order of coverage goals and how many of them are feasible.

1277714,On parameter tuning in search based software engineering,2011,Andrea Arcuri and Gordon Fraser,,,,33-47,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,When applying search-based software engineering (SBSE) techniques one is confronted with a multitude of different parameters that need to be chosen: Which population size for a genetic algorithm? Which selection mechanism to use? What settings to use for dozens of other parameters? This problem not only troubles users who want to apply SBSE tools in practice. but also researchers performing experimentation – how to compare algorithms that can have different parameter settings? To shed light on the problem of parameters. we performed the largest empirical analysis on parameter tuning in SBSE to date. collecting and statistically analysing data from more than a million experiments. As case study. we chose test data generation. one of the most popular problems in SBSE.

But how good are these tests at actually finding faults? To answer this question. we applied three state-of-the-art unit test generation tools for Java (Randoop. EvoSuite. and Agitar) to the 357 real faults in the Defects4J dataset and investigated how well the generated test suites perform at detecting these faults. Although the automatically generated test suites detected 55.7% of the faults overall. only 19.9% of all the individual test suites detected a fault. By studying the effectiveness and problems of the individual tools and the tests they generate. we derive insights to support the development of automated unit test generators that achieve a higher fault detection rate.

1277716,Sound empirical evidence in software testing,2012,Gordon Fraser and Andrea Arcuri,,,,178-188,IEEE,Several promising techniques have been proposed to automate different tasks in software testing. such as test data generation for object-oriented software. However. reported studies in the literature only show the feasibility of the proposed techniques. because the choice of the employed artifacts in the case studies (e.g.. software applications) is usually done in a non-systematic way. The chosen case study might be biased. and so it might not be a valid representative of the addressed type of software (e.g.. internet applications and embedded systems). The common trend seems to be to accept this fact and get over it by simply discussing it in a threats to validity section. In this paper. we evaluate search-based software testing (in particular the EvoSuite tool) when applied to test data generation for open source projects.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Self-adaptation is typically realized using a control loop. One prominent approach for organizing a control loop in self-adaptive systems is by means of four components that are responsible for the primary functions of self-adaptation: Monitor. Analyze. Plan. and Execute. together forming a MAPE loop. When systems are large. complex. and heterogeneous. a single MAPE loop may not be sufficient for managing all adaptation in a system. so multiple MAPE loops may be introduced. In self-adaptive systems with multiple MAPE loops. decisions about how to decentralize each of the MAPE functions must be made. These decisions involve how and whether the corresponding functions from multiple loops are to be coordinated (e.g.. planning components coordinating to prepare a plan for an adaptation).

This paper focuses on models that deal with non-functional properties. such as reliability and performance. To build such models. one must rely on numerical estimates of various parameters provided by domain experts or extracted by other similar systems. Unfortunately. estimates are seldom correct. In addition. in dynamic environments. the value of parameters may change over time. We discuss an approach that addresses these issues by keeping models alive at run time and feeding a Bayesian estimator with data collected from the running system. which produces updated parameters. The updated model provides an increasingly better representation of the system.

1277759,Characterizing and predicting which bugs get reopened,2012,Thomas Zimmermann and Nachiappan Nagappan and Philip J Guo and Brendan Murphy,,,,1074-1083,IEEE,Fixing bugs is an important part of the software development process. An underlying aspect is the effectiveness of fixes: if a fair number of fixed bugs are reopened. it could indicate instability in the software system. To the best of our knowledge there has been on little prior work on understanding the dynamics of bug reopens. Towards that end. in this paper. we characterize when bug reports are reopened by using the Microsoft Windows operating system project as an empirical case study. Our analysis is based on a mixed-methods approach. First. we categorize the primary reasons for reopens based on a survey of 358 Microsoft employees. We then reinforce these results with a large-scale quantitative study of Windows bug reports. focusing on factors related to bug report edits and relationships between people involved in handling the bug.

To this purpose. the semantics of business vocabulary and business rules (SBVR) metamodel specification was proposed. SBVR is conceptualized optimally for business people and it is designed to be used for business purposes. independently of information systems designs.Clearly. SBVR and unified modeling language (UML) cannot be considered as isolated languages. Many of the business rules specified by business people must be automatically executed by the underlying information system. and thus. they must also appear in its UML CS.

Therefore. mechanisms to ensure quality and absence of errors in models are needed to assure the reliability of the MDE-based development process. Formal methods have proven their worth in the verification of software and hardware systems. However. the adoption of formal methods as a valid alternative to ensure model correctness is compromised for the inner complexity of the problem. To circumvent this complexity. it is common to impose limitations such as reducing the type of constructs that can appear in the model. or turning the verification process from automatic into user assisted.

1277805,Designing Software Product Lines with UML,2005,Hassan Gomaa,,,,1-701,Addison Wesley Object Technology Series,This book describes an evolutionary software engineering process for the development of software product lines. which uses the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. A software product line (or product family) consists of a family of software systems that have some common functionality and some variable functionality. The interest in software product lines emerged from the field of software reuse when developers and managers realized that they could obtain much greater reuse benefits by reusing software architectures instead of reusing individual software components. The field of software product lines is increasingly recognized in industry and government as being of great strategic importance for software development. Studies indicate that if three or more systems with a degree of common functionality are to be developed. then developing a product line is significantly more cost-effective than developing …,True,YjPRWAEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1144,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10776012631457299620&hl=en&oi=scholarr,10776012631457299620,/scholar?cites=10776012631457299620,,,http://cmapspublic3.ihmc.us/rid=1GKV6XPPX-1W23605-GYF/softwareproductlines.pdf,0,0,0

Berlin. Heidelberg,Software product lines (SPL) are an established technology for developing families of systems. In particular. they focus on modeling commonality and variability. that is. they are based on identifying features common to all members of the family and variable features that appear only in some members. Model-based development methods for product lines advocate the construction of SPL requirements. analysis and design models for features. This paper describes an approach for maintaining feature separation during modeling using a UML composition language based on graph transformations. This allows models of features to be reused more easily. The language can be used to compose the SPL models for a given set of features.

This study. in patients with heterogeneous damage to these networks. demonstrates network independence through a double dissociation of lesion location on two different measures of network integrity: functional correlations among network nodes and within-node graph theory network properties. The degree of network damage correlates with a decrease in functional connectivity within that network while sparing the nonlesioned network.

The suggested model results in earlier fault-fixes having a greater effect than later ones (the faults which make the greatest contribution to the overall failure rate tend to show themselves earlier. and so are fixed earlier). and the DFR property between fault fixes (assurance about programs increases during periods of failure-free operation. as well as at fault fixes).

They first detail the foundations of VBSE. followed by a presentation of state-of-the-art methods and techniques. The third part demonstrates the benefits of VBSE through concrete examples and case studies. This book deviates from the more anecdotal style of many management-oriented software engineering books and so appeals particularly to all readers who are interested in solid foundations for high-level aspects of software engineering decision making. ie. to product or project managers driven by economics and to software …,True,7Wpa7ysAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,497,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=CAlM6nNPcsgC&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=info:lhsKtI2O-v8J:scholar.google.com&ots=R2LEbL4-Jw&sig=xM2FdUxQYF8bSxmBnstCNjnGJnw,18445211963111381910,/scholar?cites=18445211963111381910,,,,0,0,0
1277850,Developing groupware for requirements negotiation: lessons learned,2001,Barry Boehm and Paul Grunbacher and Robert O Briggs,18,IEEE software,3,46-55,IEEE,Defining requirements is a complex and difficult process. and defects in the process often lead to costly project failures. There is no complete and well-defined set of requirements waiting to be discovered in system development. Different stakeholders: users. customers. managers. domain experts. and developers. come to the project with diverse expectations and interests. Requirements emerge in a highly collaborative. interactive. and interdisciplinary negotiation process that involves heterogeneous stakeholders. At the University of Southern California's Center for Software Engineering. we have developed a series of groupware implementations for the WinWin requirements negotiation approach. The WinWin approach involves having a system's success-critical stakeholders participate in a negotiation process so they can converge on a mutually satisfactory or win-win set of requirements.

Numerous variability modeling approaches exist today to support domain and application engineering activities. Most are based on feature modeling (FM) or decision modeling (DM). but so far no systematic comparison exists between these two classes of approaches. Over the last two decades many new features have been added to both FM and DM and it is tough to decide which approach to use for what purpose. This paper clarifies the relation between FM and DM. We aim to systematize the research field of variability modeling and to explore potential synergies.

However. many existing variability modeling approaches are rigid and don’t allow sufficient domain-specific adaptations. We have thus been developing a flexible and extensible approach for defining product line variability models. Its main purposes are to guide stakeholders through product derivation and to automatically generate product configurations.

Requirements conflict with each other when they make contradicting statements about common software attributes. and they cooperate when they mutually enforce such attributes. Because software developers rarely apply formal requirements specification techniques in practice. and because reliable techniques for natural language understanding aren't available. it's generally infeasible to automatically identify conflicts and cooperation among requirements. In software development and maintenance. identifying conflicts and cooperation among requirements is challenging. Fortunately. quality attributes can help.

1277858,EasyWinWin: Managing complexity in requirements negotiation with GSS,2002,Robert O Briggs and Paul Gruenbacher,,,,10 pp.,IEEE,More than 3/4 of large software projects suffer large cost and schedule overruns or fail outright. Deficits in project requirements cause more than half of these failures and overruns. This is in part because the establishment of software requirements is fraught with complexity. Finding ways to manage that complexity might be an important step in reducing the risk of software development. Group support systems (GSS) offer functionality that may reduce some aspects of complexity and reduce the cognitive load of addressing other aspects of complexity. We examine the sources of causes of complexity in software requirements in the context of EasyWinWin. a requirements negotiation methodology supported by GSS.

1277874,Covert: Compositional analysis of android inter-app permission leakage,2015,Hamid Bagheri and Alireza Sadeghi and Joshua Garcia and Sam Malek,41,IEEE transactions on Software Engineering,9,866-886,IEEE,Android is the most popular platform for mobile devices. It facilitates sharing of data and services among applications using a rich inter-app communication system. While access to resources can be controlled by the Android permission system. enforcing permissions is not sufficient to prevent security violations. as permissions may be mismanaged. intentionally or unintentionally. Android's enforcement of the permissions is at the level of individual apps. allowing multiple malicious apps to collude and combine their permissions or to trick vulnerable apps to perform actions on their behalf that are beyond their individual privileges. In this paper. we present COVERT. a tool for compositional analysis of Android inter-app vulnerabilities.

An exploratory analysis of evolving systems,2012,Isela Macia and Joshua Garcia and Daniel Popescu and Alessandro Garcia and Nenad Medvidovic and Arndt von Staa,,,,167-178,,As software systems are maintained. their architecture modularity often degrades through architectural erosion and drift.

A number of strategies have been developed for supporting the automatic identification of implementation anomalies when only the source code is available. However. it is still unknown how reliable these strategies are when revealing code anomalies related to erosion and drift processes. In this paper. we present an exploratory analysis that investigates to what extent the automatically-detected code anomalies are related to problems that occur with an evolving system's architecture.

Although exhaustive testing of all possible combinations is the ideal upper bound in combinatorial testing. it is often infeasible. due to the combinatorial explosion of test cases. This paper presents TrimDroid. a framework for GUI testing of Android apps that uses a novel strategy to generate tests in a combinatorial. yet scalable. fashion. It is backed with automated program analysis and formally rigorous test generation engines. TrimDroid relies on program analysis to extract formal specifications.

Most analyses of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data begin with an enzymatic digestion of a complex protein mixture to generate smaller peptides that can be separated and identified by an MS/MS instrument. Peptide spectral counting techniques attempt to quantify protein abundance by counting the number of detected tryptic peptides and their corresponding MS spectra. However. spectral counting is confounded by the fact that peptide physicochemical properties severely affect MS detection resulting in each peptide having a different detection probability. Lu et al. (2007) described a modified spectral counting technique. Absolute Protein Expression (APEX). which improves on basic spectral counting methods by including a correction factor for each protein (called O                     i                   value) that accounts for variable peptide detection by MS techniques.

However. many graph analytics tasks such as graph classification and clustering require representing entire graphs as fixed length feature vectors. While the aforementioned approaches are naturally unequipped to learn such representations. graph kernels remain as the most effective way of obtaining them. However. these graph kernels use handcrafted features (eg. shortest paths. graphlets. etc.) and hence are hampered by problems such as poor generalization. To address this limitation. in this work. we propose a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn data-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs. graph2vec's embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner and are task agnostic. Hence. they could be used for any downstream task such as graph classification. clustering and even seeding supervised representation learning approaches. Our experiments on several benchmark and large real-world datasets show that graph2vec achieves significant improvements in classification and clustering accuracies over substructure representation learning approaches and are competitive with state-of-the-art graph kernels.,True,_Pvgwd0AAAAJ:CqsiOOvXZmUC,222,https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05005,1442549409951459786,/scholar?cites=1442549409951459786,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05005,0,0,0

However. existing techniques suffer from the difficulty in exercising the paths that are protected by magic bytes comparisons (eg. string equality comparisons). Several approaches have been proposed to use heavy-weight program analysis to break through magic bytes comparisons. and hence are less scalable. In this paper. we propose a program-state based binary fuzzing approach. named Steelix. which improves the penetration power of a fuzzer at the cost of an acceptable slow down of the execution speed. In particular. we use light-weight static analysis and binary instrumentation to provide not only coverage information but also comparison progress information to a fuzzer.

These latent representations encode semantic substructure dependencies in a continuous vector space. which is easily exploited by statistical models for tasks such as graph classification. clustering. link prediction and community detection. subgraph2vec leverages on local information obtained from neighbourhoods of nodes to learn their latent representations in an unsupervised fashion. We demonstrate that subgraph vectors learnt by our approach could be used in conjunction with classifiers such as CNNs. SVMs and relational data clustering algorithms to achieve significantly superior accuracies. Also. we show that the subgraph vectors could be used for building a deep learning variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. Our experiments on several benchmark and large-scale real-world datasets reveal that subgraph2vec achieves significant improvements in accuracies over existing graph kernels on both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Specifically. on two realworld program analysis tasks. namely. code clone and malware detection. subgraph2vec outperforms state-of-the-art kernels by more than 17% and 4%. respectively.,True,_Pvgwd0AAAAJ:MwdXMY9cq6YC,142,https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08928,11946384961322445639,/scholar?cites=11946384961322445639,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08928,0,0,0

In order to reduce complexity. we distinguish strategic. tactical. and operational information management. This is essential. because each of these information management levels views hospital information systems from different perspectives. and therefore uses other methods and tools. Since all these management activities deal only in part with computers. but mainly with human beings and their social behavior. we define a hospital information system as a sociotechnical subsystem of a hospital. Without proper strategic planning it would be a matter of chance. if a hospital information system would fulfil the information strategies goals.

1277944,Continuous monitoring of software services: Design and application of the Kieker framework,2009,André van Hoorn and Matthias Rohr and Wilhelm Hasselbring and Jan Waller and Jens Ehlers and Sören Frey and Dennis Kieselhorst,,,,,Department of Computer Science. Kiel University. Germany,In addition to studying the construction and evolution of software services. the software engineering discipline needs to address the operation of continuously running software services. A requirement for its robust operation are means for effective monitoring of software runtime behavior. In contrast to profiling for construction activities. monitoring of operational services should only impose a small performance overhead. Furthermore. instrumentation should be non-intrusive to the business logic. as far as possible.  We present the Kieker framework for monitoring software runtime behavior. e.g.. internal performance or (distributed) trace data. The flexible architecture allows to replace or add framework components. including monitoring probes. analysis components. and monitoring record types shared by logging and analysis. As a non-intrusive instrumentation technique. Kieker currently employs. but is not restricted to. aspect-oriented programming. An extensive lab study evaluates and quantifies the low overhead caused by the framework components. Qualitative evaluations provided by industrial case studies demonstrate the practicality of the approach with a telecommunication customer self service and a digital photo submission service. Kieker is available as open-source software. where both the academic and industrial partners contribute to the code.

The need for such an integration is driven by the requirement to continuously adapt enterprise applications (EAs) to changes in the business environment. As of today. DevOps concepts have been primarily introduced to ensure a constant flow of features and bug fixes into new releases from a functional perspective. In order to integrate a non-functional perspective into these DevOps concepts this report focuses on tools. activities. and processes to ensure one of the most important quality attributes of a software system. namely performance.Performance describes system properties concerning its timeliness and use of resources. Common metrics are response time. throughput. and resource utilization. Performance goals for EAs are typically defined by setting upper and/or lower bounds for these metrics and specific business transactions. In order to ensure that such performance goals can be met. several activities are required during development and operation of these systems as well as during the transition from Dev to Ops. Activities during development are typically summarized by the term Software Performance Engineering (SPE). whereas activities during operations are called Application Performance Management (APM). SPE and APM were historically tackled independently from each other. but the newly emerging DevOps concepts require and enable a tighter integration between both activity streams.

Clarke,,IEEE Transactions on software engineering,3,215-222,IEEE,This paper describes a system that attempts to generate test data for programs written in ANSI Fortran. Given a path. the system symbolically executes the path and creates a set of constraints on the program's input variables. If the set of constraints is linear. linear programming techniques are employed to obtain a solution. A solution to the set of constraints is test data that will drive execution down the given path. If it can be determined that the set of constraints is inconsistent. then the given path is shown to be nonexecutable. To increase the chance of detecting some of the more common programming errors. artificial constraints are temporarily created that simulate error conditions and then an attempt is made to solve each augmented set of constraints. A symbolic representation of the program's output variables in terms of the program's input variables is also created.

Two generalizations of control and data flow dependence. called weak and strong syntactic dependence. are introduced and related to a concept called semantic dependence. Semantic dependence models the ability of a program statement to affect the execution behavior of other statements. It is shown that weak syntactic dependence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for semantic dependence and that strong syntactic dependence is necessary but not sufficient condition for a restricted form of semantic dependence that is finitely demonstrated.

Using this approach. a developer specifies a property of a concurrent program as a pattern of selected program events and asks the analysis to verify that all or no program executions satisfy the given property. We have developed a family of polynomial-time. conservative data flow anlysis algorithms that support reasoning about these questions. To overcome the traditional inaccuracies of static analysis. we have also developed a range of techniques for improving the accuracy of the analysis results.

It is thus applicable to high-level descriptions as well as to low-level designs. Partition analysis also improves upon existing testing criteria. These criteria usually consider only the implementation. but partition analysis selects test data that exercise both a procedure's intended behavior (as described in the specifications) and the structure of its implementation.

Ltd.,Mutation testing (MT) has been found to be effective at revealing faults. However. its high cost of application. due to the high number of mutants created and the effort to determine the equivalent ones. has motivated the proposition of alternative approaches for its application. One of them. named ‘selective mutation’. aims to reduce the number of generated mutants through a reduction in the number of mutant operators. A previous relevant study resulted in the proposition of a sufficient mutant operators set for FORTRAN. indicating that it is possible to have a large cost reduction in MT application. whilst preserving a high MT score. This work investigates procedures for the determination of a sufficient mutant operators set for C programs with the perspective of contributing to the establishment of low‐cost. effective mutation‐based testing strategies.

Essa família de critérios estabelece uma hierarquia de critérios entre os critérios todos os ramos e todos os caminhos. e ainda satisfaz o requisito mínimo de cobertura do ponto de vista de fluxo de dados. mesmo na presença de caminhos não executáveis. Mostra-se que a complexidade desses critérios. assim como a dos demais critérios baseados em análise de fluxo de dados é de ordem exponencial. São caracterizados alguns modelos básicos para automatização desses critérios com o objetivo de estabelecer um núcleo básico para a automatização de critérios de teste estrutural; investiga-se o uso do conceito de arco essencial [CHU87] no contexto de teste baseado em fluxo de dados.

Comprehensive sets of mutants require strong test sets to achieve acceptable testing coverage. Moreover. mutation operators are valuable for the evaluation of other testing approaches. Although its importance has been highlighted for aspect-oriented (AO) programs. there is still a need for a suitable set of mutation operators for AO languages. The quality of the mutation testing itself relies on the quality of such operators. This paper presents the design of a set of mutation operators for AspectJ-based programs. These operators model instances of fault types identified in an extensive survey. The fault types and respective operators are grouped according to the related language features.

Analyzing the type of information needed for efficient fault localization. we identify the attribute (called Dynamic Basic Block) that restricts the accuracy of a diagnosis algorithm.

For incremental development. we added two elements to the method: c) counting both all and the modified actors and transactions of use cases. and d) effort estimation for secondary changes of software not reflected in use cases. We finally extended the method to: e) cover all development effort in a very large project.

1277987,Quality. productivity and economic benefits of software reuse: a review of industrial studies,2007,Parastoo Mohagheghi and Reidar Conradi,12,,5,471-516,Springer US,Systematic software reuse is proposed to increase productivity and software quality and lead to economic benefits. Reports of successful software reuse programs in industry have been published. However. there has been little effort to organize the evidence systematically and appraise it. This review aims to assess the effects of software reuse in industrial contexts. Journals and major conferences between 1994 and 2005 were searched to find observational studies and experiments conducted in industry. returning eleven papers of observational type. Systematic software reuse is significantly related to lower problem (defect. fault or error) density in five studies and to decreased effort spent on correcting problems in three studies. The review found evidence for significant gains in apparent productivity in three studies. Other significant benefits of software reuse were reported in single studies or the results …,True,AXYmi1IAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,187,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-007-9040-x,1182536653627026867,/scholar?cites=1182536653627026867,,,https://sintef.brage.unit.no/sintef-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2431801/mohagheghi-reuse-review-fulltext.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

1277993,A survey on software clone detection research,2007,Chanchal Kumar Roy and James R Cordy,541,Queen’s School of Computing TR,115,64-68,,Code duplication or copying a code fragment and then reuse by pasting with or without any modifications is a well known code smell in software maintenance. Several studies show that about 5% to 20% of a software systems can contain duplicated code. which is basically the results of copying existing code fragments and using then by pasting with or without minor modifications. One of the major shortcomings of such duplicated fragments is that if a bug is detected in a code fragment. all the other fragments similar to it should be investigated to check the possible existence of the same bug in the similar fragments. Refactoring of the duplicated code is another prime issue in software maintenance although several studies claim that refactoring of certain clones are not desirable and there is a risk of removing them. However. it is also widely agreed that clones should at least be detected. In this paper. we survey the state of the art in clone detection research. First. we describe the clone terms commonly used in the literature along with their corresponding mappings to the commonly used clone types. Second. we provide a review of the existing clone taxonomies. detection approaches and experimental evaluations of clone detection tools.

While some work has been done on assessing and comparing performance of these tools. very little empirical evaluation has been done. In particular. accuracy measures such as precision and recall have only been roughly estimated. due both to problems in creating a validated clone benchmark against which tools can be compared. and to the manual effort required to hand check large numbers of candidate clones.

However. these advances have not been matched by equal advances in the adoption of these standards and models in software development which has resulted in limited success for many SPI efforts. The current problem with SPI is not a lack of standard or model. but rather a lack of an effective strategy to successfully implement these standards or models. The importance of SPI implementation demands that it be recognised as a complex process in its own right and that organizations should determine their SPI implementation maturity through an organized set of activities.

Nonmonotonic logic is a theoretically well-founded formalism that is especially suited for supporting the evolution of requirements.

Lately. there has been an increase in the number of tools for analyzing traces generated from object-oriented systems. This interest has been driven by the fact that polymorphism and dynamic binding pose serious limitations to static analysis. However. most of the techniques supported by existing tools are found in the context of very specific visualization schemes. which makes them hard to reuse. It is also very common to have two different tools implement the same techniques using different terminology. This appears to result from the absence of a common framework for trace analysis approaches. This paper presents the state of the art in the area of trace analysis.

Similar to text summarization. where abstracts can be extracted from large documents. the aim of trace summarization is to take an execution trace as input and return a summary of its main content as output. The resulting summary can then be converted into a UML sequence diagram and used by software engineers to understand the main behavioural aspects of the system. Our approach to trace summarization is based on the removal of implementation details such as utilities from execution traces.

Regrettably. finding and applying the appropriate architectural patterns in practice still remains largely ad-hoc and unsystematic. This is due to the lack of consensus in the community with respect to the “philosophy” and granularity of architectural patterns. as well as the lack of a coherent pattern language.

Since the birthmarks are unique and native characteristics of every class file. a class file with the same birthmark of another can be easily suspected as a copy. However. performance and tolerance of the birthmarks against sophisticated attacks had not been evaluated well. To clarify these issues. this paper conducts two experiments. In the first experiment. we demonstrate that the proposed birthmarks successfully distinguish non-copied files in practical Java application (97.8005%).

This is because Java programs can be easily decomposed into reusable class files and even decompiled into source code by program users. We propose a practical method that discourages program theft by embedding Java programs with a digital watermark. Embedding a program developer's copyright notation as a watermark in Java class files will ensure the legal ownership of class files. Our embedding method is indiscernible by program users. yet enables us to identify an illegal program that contains stolen class files. The result of the experiment to evaluate our method showed most of the watermarks (20 out of 23) embedded in class files survived two kinds of attacks that attempt to erase watermarks: an obfuscactor attack. and a decompile-recompile attack.,True,-DfBligAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC,157,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/884716/,7286821954279610306,/scholar?cites=7286821954279610306,,,https://library.naist.jp/dspace/bitstream/handle/10061/12769/10061_12769.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

This service is similar to the cable or satellite TV already in the home. and user-centric interactive mobile Video-on-Demand (VoD) over urban vehicular networks is in fact expected.

In smart phones. battery power capabilities are not keeping up with the advances in other technologies (e.g.. processing and memory) and are rapidly becoming a concern. especially in view of the growth in usage of energy-hungry mobile multimedia streaming. The deficiency in battery power and the need for reduced energy consumption provides motivation for researchers to develop energy efficient techniques in order to manage the power consumption in next-generation wireless networks. As there is little analysis in the literature on the relationship between the wireless environment and the mobile device energy consumption. this paper investigates the impact of network-related factors (e.g.. network load and signal quality level) on the power consumption of the mobile device in the context of video delivery.

This paper presents a solution to this challenge by using the Quality-Oriented Adaptation Scheme (QOAS) for delivering multimedia streams. This adaptive mechanism uses feedback from clients regarding the quality of delivery to assist the server in making dynamic adjustments to the transmitted streams. Experimental objective and subjective test results illustrate the significant performance improvements achieved by QOAS. both in terms of number of simultaneous viewers served and of end-user perceived quality.,True,YplNXJEAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC,104,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1269939/,18230383214588405838,/scholar?cites=18230383214588405838,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.61.1021&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Stream control transmission protocol (SCTP)-based concurrent multipath transfer (CMT) improves the wireless video delivery performance with its parallel transmission and bandwidth (BW) aggregation features. However. the existing CMT solutions deployed at the transport layer only are not accurate enough due to lower layer uncertainties. such as variations of the wireless channel. In addition. CMT-based video transmission may use excessive BW in comparison with the popular Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)-based flows. which results in unfair sharing of network resources.

A solution that deals with this mobile broadband data growth is to make use of multiple networks supported by diverse radio access technologies. This multiaccess solution requires innovative network selection mechanisms to keep the mobile users always best connected anywhere and anytime.

But dealing with large systems-those consisting of several millions of lines-at the code level faces many problems. An alternative approach is to concentrate on the system's building blocks such as programs or modules as the unit of examination. We present an approach that uses information in a release history of a system to uncover logical dependencies and change patterns among modules. We have developed the approach by working with 20 releases of a large Telecommunications Switching System. We use release information such as version numbers of programs. modules. and subsystems together with change reports to discover common change behavior (i.e. change patterns) of modules.

In this paper. we examine the structure of several releases of a telecommunication switching system (TSS) based on information stored in a database of product releases. We tracked the historical evolution of the TSS structure and related the adaptations made (e.g. addition of new features. etc.) to the structure of the system. Such a systematic examination can uncover potential shortcomings in the structure of the system and identify modules or subsystems that should be subject to restructuring or reengineering.

The ability to quickly grasp a comprehensive view of the evolution and dependencies of such information is the key to making informed decisions about future developments of the system. Managers usually make such decision based only on expert judgement. For help in making such decisions. we can turn to the evolution history of large software systems. which contain a wealth of hidden information. Traditionally. this information is passed on through anecdotes without any supporting analytical data.

The circularity problem for a grammar is to determine whether the semantics for all possible sentences (programs) in fact will be well defined. It is proved that this problem is. in general. computationally intractable. Specifically. it is shown that any deterministic algorithm which solves the problem must for infinitely many cases use an exponential amount of time. An improved version of Knuth's circularity testing algorithm is also given. which actually solves the problem within exponential time.,True,cXcqHogAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,168,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/361227.361231,16508911115543654628,/scholar?cites=16508911115543654628,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Ogden/publication/200034048_The_intrinsically_exponential_complexity_of_the_circularity_problem_for_attribute_grammars/links/00b7d519137dce8235000000/The-intrinsically-exponential-complexity-of-the-circularity-problem-for-attribute-grammars.pdf,0,0,0

This paper presents a generalized algorithm that finds a path cover for a given program flowgraph. The analysis is conducted on a reduced flowgraph. called a ddgraph. and uses graph theoretic principles differently than previous approaches. In particular. the relations of dominance and implication which form two trees of the arcs of the ddgraph are exploited.

A spanning set is a minimum subset of E/sub r/. such that a test suite covering the entities in this subset is guaranteed to cover every entity in E/sub r/.

We exploit the specification of SA dynamics to identify useful schemes of interactions between system components and to select test classes corresponding to relevant architectural behaviors. The SA dynamics is modeled by labeled transition systems (LTSs). The approach consists of deriving suitable LTS abstractions called ALTSs. ALTSs offer specific views of SA dynamics by concentrating on relevant features and abstracting away from uninteresting ones. Intuitively. deriving an adequate set of test classes entails deriving a set of paths that appropriately cover the ALTS. Next. a relation between these abstract SA tests and more concrete. executable tests needs to be established so that the architectural tests derived can be refined …,True,i5To0fcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,157,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1271170/,2712919396271912167,/scholar?cites=2712919396271912167,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.90.5613&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Given an input for a system. the challenge of distinguishing the corresponding desired. correct behaviour from potentially incorrect behavior is called the “test oracle problem”. Test oracle automation is important to remove a current bottleneck that inhibits greater overall test automation. Without test oracle automation. the human has to determine whether observed behaviour is correct.

However. despite the large number of recent studies on the applicability of different search-based optimization approaches. there has been very little theoretical analysis of the types of testing problem for which these techniques are well suited.

Key to the optimization process is a problem-specific fitness function. The role of the fitness function is to guide the search to good solutions from a potentially infinite search space. within a practical time limit. Work on Search-Based Software Testing dates back to 1976. with interest in the area beginning to gather pace in the 1990s. More recently there has been an explosion of the amount of work.

However. hitherto. there has been no work on multi-objective branch coverage. In many scenarios a single-objective formulation is unrealistic; testers will want to find test sets that meet several objectives simultaneously in order to maximize the value obtained from the inherently expensive process of running the test cases and examining the output they produce. This paper introduces multi-objective branch coverage. The paper presents results from a case study of the twin objectives of branch coverage and dynamic memory consumption for both real and synthetic programs. Several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are applied.

Although the automatically generated test suites detected 55.7% of the faults overall. only 19.9% of all the individual test suites detected a fault.

Additional guidance is required to find sequences of inputs that put the test object into some necessary state for certain test goals to become feasible. It is shown that data dependency analysis can be used to identify program statements responsible for state transitions. and then argued that an additional search is needed to find required transition sequences.

Existing approximation algorithms for this problem can scale to at most a few hundred machines. and may produce placement solutions that are far from optimal when system resources are tight. In this paper. we propose a new algorithm that can produce within 30seconds high-quality solutions for hard placement problems with thousands of machines and thousands of applications. This scalability is crucial for dynamic resource provisioning in large-scale enterprise data centers.

To provide a meaningful comparison the authors define the concept of a schedulable region. a region in the space of loads for which the quality of service is guaranteed. The authors show the dependence of the schedulable region on the scheduling algorithm employed. quality of service parameters. and traffic statistics. An efficient real-time scheduling algorithm is introduced that substantially increases the schedulable region without incurring prohibitive complexity costs.

We define application instance placement as the problem of placing application instances on a given set of server machines to adjust the amount of resources available to applications in response to varying resource demands of application clusters. The objective is to maximize the amount of demand that may be satisfied using a configured placement. To limit the disturbance to the system caused by starting and stopping application instances. the placement algorithm attempts to minimize the number of placement changes. It also strives to keep resource utilization balanced across all server machines. Two types of resources are managed. one load-dependent and one load-independent.

This paper addresses a deficit of earlier evaluations of automated repair techniques caused by repairing programs and evaluating generated patches' correctness using the same set of tests. Since tests are an imperfect metric of program correctness. evaluations of this type do not discriminate between correct patches and patches that overfit the available tests and break untested but desired functionality. This paper evaluates two well-studied repair tools. GenProg and TrpAutoRepair. on a publicly available benchmark of bugs. each with a human-written patch. By evaluating patches using tests independent from those used during repair. we find that the tools are unlikely to improve the proportion of independent tests passed. and that the quality of the patches is proportional to the coverage of the test suite …,True,YVfr3wwAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC,227,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2786805.2786825,3574471276823118201,/scholar?cites=3574471276823118201,,,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10019053,0,0,0

Pnueli. and the use of tools from category theory as a means for structuring specifications as combinations of theories in the style developed by R. Burstall and J. Goguen. As a result. we obtain a framework in which systems of interconnected components can be described by assembling the specifications of their components around a diagram. using theory morphisms to specify how the components interact. This view of temporal theories as specification units naturally brings modularity to the description and analysis of systems. Moreover. it becomes possible to import into the area of formal development of reactive systems the wide body of specification techniques that have been defined for structuring specifications independently of the underlying logic. and that have been applied with …,True,WP1EE9UAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,224,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01212304,1488480823556086697,/scholar?cites=1488480823556086697,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.37.1923&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The semantic structures are Kripke models. as is usual for modal logic. The “possible worlds” in a Kripke model are the states of the agent. and there is a separate relation on the set of states for each action term.Agents potentially share actions as well as attributes in a way controlled by locality annotations in the specification texts. These become locality axioms in the logical theories the texts denote. These locality axioms provide a refined way of circumscribing the effects of actions.Safety and liveness conditions are expressed (implicitly) by deontic axioms. which impose obligations and …,True,WP1EE9UAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,135,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-54415-1_65.pdf,565670333006589134,/scholar?cites=565670333006589134,,,http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mdr/research/papers/pdf/91-tacs.pdf,0,0,0

We have a well developed theory of abstract data types that explains how to structure specifications based on the notion of value. but objects involve imperative notions such as those of action and state which are not well captured in an applicative way. In this paper. we focus on the development of an alternative framework to support systems design based on the concept of object. We provide a notion of object signature around which we define the notion of locality (encapsulation). We adopt a deontic action logic for the description of objects.

Whereas previous approaches to refinement in the context of temporal logic such as those developed by Lamport and by Barringer. Kuiper and Pnueli are based on a single logic that accommodates different levels of action granularity. our approach is based on relating different logics corresponding to different levels of granularity. More precisely. we map abstract actions (propositions) to concrete objects (theories) and. through inference rules that relate the different logics. derive properties of the abstracted actions from the behaviour of the corresponding objects.

Trying to fill this gap. this paper presents a reference model for adaptive hypermedia applications. similar to AHAM. The main novelty of our approach is an object-oriented specification written in UML (Unified Modeling Language) which integrates both an intuitive visual representation and a formal unambiguous specification in OCL (Object Constraint Language).

On hierarchical abstract data types additional structure is imposed. An algebraic specification is thus decomposed into several well-separated levels. such that both the understanding and the independent implementation of the levels is supported. This paper provides both model-theoretic and deduction-oriented conditions guaranteeing the soundness of a hierarchical specification. Furthermore necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of initial and terminal models are investigated. and their close connection to the soundness of a hierarchy is demonstrated.

Heidelberg,A structural operational semantics of a significant sublanguage of Java is presented. including the running and stopping of threads. thread interaction via shared memory. synchronization by monitoring and notification. and sequential control mechanisms such as exception handling and return statements. The operational semantics is parametric in the notion of “event space” [6]. which formalizes the rules that threads and memory must obey in their interaction. Different computational models are obtained by modifying the well-formedness conditions on event spaces while leaving the operational rules untouched.

1278178,On the algebraic definition of programming languages,1987,Manfred Broy and Martin Wirsing and Peter Pepper,9,ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS),1,54-99,ACM,The algebraic specification of the semantics of programming languages is outlined. Particular emphasis is given to the problem of specifying least-fixed points by first-order conditional equations. To cover this issue. the theory of specifying partial heterogeneous algebras by abstract data types is slightly extended by a more general notion of homomorphism. In this framework the semantics of programming languages can be uniquely specified in a purely algebraic way. using particular models of a hierarchy of abstract types. This approach is demonstrated for a simple procedural programming language. Several increasingly complex versions of iterations are treated and analyzed with respect to their theoretical consequences. Finally. as a complementary algebraic technique. transformational semantics is explained and applied to our examples.,True,QonRHo8AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,97,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/9758.10501,7342953702159058975,/scholar?cites=7342953702159058975,,,,0,0,0
1278179,Metamorphic testing: a new approach for generating next test cases,2020,Tsong Y Chen and Shing C Cheung and Shiu Ming Yiu,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.12543,,,,In software testing. a set of test cases is constructed according to some predefined selection criteria. The software is then examined against these test cases. Three interesting observations have been made on the current artifacts of software testing. Firstly. an error-revealing test case is considered useful while a successful test case which does not reveal software errors is usually not further investigated. Whether these successful test cases still contain useful information for revealing software errors has not been properly studied. Secondly. no matter how extensive the testing has been conducted in the development phase. errors may still exist in the software [5]. These errors. if left undetected. may eventually cause damage to the production system. The study of techniques for uncovering software errors in the production phase is seldom addressed in the literature. Thirdly. as indicated by Weyuker in [6]. the availability of test oracles is pragmatically unattainable in most situations. However. the availability of test oracles is generally assumed in conventional software testing techniques. In this paper. we propose a novel test case selection technique that derives new test cases from the successful ones. The selection aims at revealing software errors that are possibly left undetected in successful test cases which may be generated using some existing strategies. As such. the proposed technique augments the effectiveness of existing test selection strategies. The technique also helps uncover software errors in the production phase and can be used in the absence of test oracles.,True,5RIgb3wAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,515,https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12543,4783848019278684241,/scholar?cites=4783848019278684241,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12543,0,0,0

Usually. the links are automatically mined from change logs and bug reports using heuristics such as searching for specific keywords and bug IDs in change logs. However. the accuracy of these heuristics depends on the quality of change logs. Bird et al. found that there are many missing links due to the absence of bug references in change logs. They also found that the missing links lead to biased defect information. and it affects defect prediction performance.

1278181,Characterizing and detecting performance bugs for smartphone applications,2014,Yepang Liu and Chang Xu and Shing-Chi Cheung,,,,1013-1024,,Smartphone applications’ performance has a vital impact on user experience. However. many smartphone applications suffer from bugs that cause significant performance degradation. thereby losing their competitive edge. Unfortunately. people have little understanding of these performance bugs. They also lack effective techniques to fight with such bugs. To bridge this gap. we conducted a study of 70 real-world performance bugs collected from eight large-scale and popular Android applications. We studied the characteristics (eg. bug types and how they manifested) of these bugs and identified their common patterns.

1278182,Taming coincidental correctness: Coverage refinement with context patterns to improve fault localization,2009,Xinming Wang and Shing-Chi Cheung and Wing Kwong Chan and Zhenyu Zhang,,,,45-55,IEEE,Recent techniques for fault localization leverage code coverage to address the high cost problem of debugging. These techniques exploit the correlations between program failures and the coverage of program entities as the clue in locating faults. Experimental evidence shows that the effectiveness of these techniques can be affected adversely by coincidental correctness. which occurs when a fault is executed but no failure is detected. In this paper. we propose an approach to address this problem. We refine code coverage of test runs using control- and data-flow patterns prescribed by different fault types. We conjecture that this extra information. which we call context patterns. can strengthen the correlations between program failures and the coverage of faulty program entities. making it easier for fault localization techniques to locate the faults. To evaluate the proposed approach. we have conducted a mutation …,True,5RIgb3wAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,176,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5070507/,9685062151073963639,/scholar?cites=9685062151073963639,,,https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~wkchan/papers/icse09-wang+cheung+chan+zhang.pdf,0,0,0

Such e-services typically require collaborative enactment of workflows across multiple organizations. In this paper. we propose the use of workflow views as a fundamental support mechanism for the interoperability of multiple workflows across business organizations. We present a meta-model of workflow views and their semantics using a cross-organization workflow example based on a supply-chain e-service. We also formulate an interoperation model of workflow views and its consistency criteria. Finally. this paper presents an implementation of the model based on XML and contemporary Web services technologies. with adaptation to our E-ADOME workflow engine.,True,5RIgb3wAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,168,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:ITEM.0000031580.57966.d4,17011831785932686260,/scholar?cites=17011831785932686260,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.454.9488&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1278184,Inconsistency detection and resolution for context-aware middleware support,2005,Chang Xu and Shing-Chi Cheung,30,ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes,5,336-345,ACM,Context-awareness is a key feature of pervasive computing whose environments keep evolving. The support of context-awareness requires comprehensive management including detection and resolution of context inconsistency. which occurs naturally in pervasive computing. In this paper we present a framework for realizing dynamic context consistency management. The framework supports inconsistency detection based on a semantic matching and inconsistency triggering model. and inconsistency resolution with proactive actions to context sources. We further present an implementation based on the Cabot middleware. The feasibility of the framework and its performance are evaluated through a case study and a simulated experiment. respectively.,True,5RIgb3wAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,160,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1095430.1081759,14012698877733898605,/scholar?cites=14012698877733898605,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chang_Xu2/publication/234777512_Inconsistency_detection_and_resolution_for_context-aware_middleware_support/links/02e7e525d56d191338000000.pdf,0,0,0

At the same time. healthcare environments are by nature ""mobile"" where doctors and nurses do not have fixed workspaces. Irregular and exceptional events are generated in daily hospital routines. such as operations rescheduling. laboratory/examination results. and adverse drug events. These events may create requests that should be delivered to the appropriate person at the appropriate time. Those requests that are classified as urgent are referred to as alerts . Efficient routing and monitoring of alerts are keys to quality and cost-effective healthcare services. Presently. these are generally handled in an ad hoc manner. In this paper. we propose the use of a healthcare alert management system to handle these alert messages systematically.

1278186,Context constraints for compositional reachability analysis,1996,Shing Chi Cheung and Jeff Kramer,5,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM),4,334-377,ACM,Behavior analysis of complex distributed systems has led to the search for enhanced reachability analysis techniques which support modularity and which control the state explosion problem. While modularity has been achieved. state explosion in still a problem. Indeed. this problem may even be exacerbated. as a locally minimized subsystem may contain many states and transitions forbidden by its environment or context. Context constraints. specified as interface processes. are restrictions imposed by the environment on subsystem behavior. Recent research has suggested that the state explosion problem can be effectively controlled if context constraints are incorporated in compositional reachability analysis (CRA). Although theoretically very promising. the approach has rarely been  used in practice because it generally requires a more complex computational model and does not contain a mechanism to …,True,5RIgb3wAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,134,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/235321.235323,8232679435325406169,/scholar?cites=8232679435325406169,,,https://repository.ust.hk/ir/bitstream/1783.1-60/1/tr9605.pdf,0,0,0

A service-oriented application may bind dynamically to its supportive services. For the same service interface. the supportive services may behave differently. A service may also need to realize a business strategy. like best pricing. relative to the behavior of its counterparts and the dynamic market situations. Many existing works ignore these issues to address the problem of identifying failures from test results. This article proposes a metamorphic approach for online services testing. The off-line testing determines a set of successful test cases to construct their corresponding follow-up test cases for the online testing. These test cases will be executed by metamorphic services that encapsulate the services under test as well as the implementations of metamorphic relations. Thus. any failure revealed by the metamorphic …,True,5RIgb3wAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,133,https://www.igi-global.com/article/international-journal-web-services-research/3099,7229388260336746612,/scholar?cites=7229388260336746612,,,http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~wkchan/papers/e-govt08-chan+cheung+leung.pdf,0,0,0
1278188,Checking safety properties using compositional reachability analysis,1999,Shing Chi Cheung and Jeff Kramer,8,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM),1,49-78,ACM,The software architecture of a distributed program can be represented  by a hierarchical composition of subsystems. with interacting processes at the leaves of the hierarchy. Compositional reachability analysis (CRA) is a promising state reduction technique which can be automated and used in stages to derive the overall behavior of a distributed program based on its architecture. CRA is particularly suitable for the analysis of programs that are subject to evolutionary change. When a program evolves. only the behaviors of those subsystems affected by the change need be reevaluated. The technique however has a limitation. The properties available for analysis are constrained by the set of actions that remain globally observable. Properties involving actions encapsulated by subsystems  may therefore not be analyzed. In this article. we enhance the CRA technique to check safety properties which may contain …,True,5RIgb3wAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,131,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/295558.295570,4191900789974992931,/scholar?cites=4191900789974992931,,,https://repository.ust.hk/ir/bitstream/1783.1-2109/1/1_4checksafe.pdf,0,0,0
1278189,Context-aware patch generation for better automated program repair,2018,Ming Wen and Junjie Chen and Rongxin Wu and Dan Hao and Shing-Chi Cheung,,,,1-11,IEEE,The effectiveness of search-based automated program repair is limited in the number of correct patches that can be successfully generated. There are two causes of such limitation. First. the search space does not contain the correct patch. Second. the search space is huge and therefore the correct patch cannot be generated (ie correct patches are either generated after incorrect plausible ones or not generated within the time budget). To increase the likelihood of including the correct patches in the search space. we propose to work at a fine granularity in terms of AST nodes. This. however. will further enlarge the search space. increasing the challenge to find the correct patches. We address the challenge by devising a strategy to prioritize the candidate patches based on their likelihood of being correct. Specifically. we study the use of AST nodes' context information to estimate the likelihood.
