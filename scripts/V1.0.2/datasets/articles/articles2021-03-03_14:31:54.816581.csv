1089900,Antimony in the environment: a review focused on natural waters: I. Occurrence,2002,Montserrat Filella and Nelson Belzile and Yu-Wei Chen,,57,,1-2,125-176,Elsevier,Antimony is ubiquitously present in the environment as a result of natural processes and human activities. It exists mainly as Sb(III) and Sb(V) in environmental. biological and geochemical samples. Antimony and its compounds are considered to be priority pollutants interest by the USEPA and the EU. In this first review paper on antimony occurrence in natural waters. 420 papers on freshwaters. marine waters. estuaries. soils. and sediments have been reviewed. All data are quoted from the original sources. Typical concentrations of total dissolved antimony are usually less than 1.0 μg/l in non-polluted waters. When redox speciation determinations are performed. most studies report the dominance of Sb(V) under oxic conditions. However. the presence of significant proportions of Sb(III) is sometimes detected.

Ontario. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopic analyses indicated that the Fe-rich material collected was predominantly ferrihydrite and poorly crystallized lepidocrocite. while the Mn-rich material was a mixture of poorly crystallized Mn oxyhydroxides.

The lakes were chosen to cover values of pH between 4.0 and 8.4 and various As concentrations. Depth-distributions of dissolved As and Fe concentrations suggest a close association of both elements in a dissolution-diifusion-precipitation cycle for Fe and adsorbed As. Using a simplified version of the surface complexation model. apparent adsorption constants of As onto natural Fe oxyhydroxides have been calculated from the concentrations of As and Fe determined in leachates of surficial lake sediments and the in situ measurement of dissolved As in their respective overlying waters.

Antimony first attracted public attention in the mid-1990s amid claims that it was involved in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

1089906,A review on pyrrhotite oxidation,2004,Nelson Belzile and Yu-Wei Chen and Mei-Fang Cai and Yuerong Li,,84,,2,65-76,Elsevier,The non-stoichiometric compounds of iron sulphide named pyrrhotite (Fe1−xS) are often associated with pyrite (FeS2) in sulphidic ores and their waste products. The factors affecting pyrite and pyrrhotite oxidation are similar but the latter has received much less attention. As it is the case for pyrite. an increase in temperature has an increasing effect on the oxidation of pyrrhotite and the process follows the Arrhenius behaviour. Both ferric iron and bacteria act as catalysts in the oxidation reactions and play a significant role in the oxidation kinetics. Several spectroscopic techniques are used to study the oxidation mechanisms and products of pyrrhotite oxidation. This paper presents and discusses the main factors controlling pyrrhotite oxidation and the proposed mechanisms of oxidation under normal conditions of temperature and pressure.,True,rpf8oeQAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,277,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037567420400024X,6081253059981493981,/scholar?cites=6081253059981493981,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nelson_Belzile/publication/223602163_A_Review_on_Pyrrhotite_Oxidation/links/5a943016aca2721405673bda/A-Review-on-Pyrrhotite-Oxidation.pdf,0,0,0
1089907,Selenium and mercury in organisms: interactions and mechanisms,2008,Dan-Yi Yang and Yu-Wei Chen and John M Gunn and Nelson Belzile,,16,,NA,71-92,,This paper reviews the growing literature dealing with the antagonistic effect of selenium (Se) compounds on the toxicity of mercury (Hg) compounds in higher animals and organisms present in the aquatic environment. It covers both laboratory and field studies and summarizes the possible mechanisms that explain the protective action of Se compounds on mercuric mercury (Hg2+) and methylmercury (CH3Hg+) toxicity. The review is subdivided according to the molecular form of Hg and the organisms in which the antagonism has been studied. Many authors suggest that the protective effect of selenite on the toxicity of Hg2+ in mammals is due mainly to the in vivo formation of mercuric selenide (HgSe). a stable and biologically inert complex. The detection of HgSe has been confirmed in several studies in support of this mechanism.

Sb(III). at different pH values. Sb species were measured by differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltametry (DPACSV). The oxidation of Sb(III) to Sb(V) was always rapid and completed after a few days following pseudo-first order rate laws. A slightly slower oxidation rate was observed at lower pH and was attributed to the lower stability of the oxyhydroxide compounds under mildly acidic conditions. The oxidation pseudo-first order rate of Sb(III) by natural Fe oxyhydroxides was also slower when compared to synthetic Fe compounds. This could be explained by a slight crystallinity of the natural oxides (when compared to amorphous synthetic compounds) and by their more complex chemical composition which can include adsorbed ions and organic matter.

Dissolution of the deposits showed that only arsenate was present. i.e. arsenite concentrations were undetectable. Laboratory batch experiments indicated that As(III) is oxidized rapidly by Fe oxyhydroxides. Apparent equilibrium constants for the absorption of As have been calculated from the Fe and As concentrations dissolved from the deposit of diagenetic material and As concentration in the water overlying the lake sediments. These field‐derived equilibrium constants agree well with laboratory‐derived equilibrium constants for the absorption of arsenate on amorphous Fe oxyhydroxides; the results taken together suggest that the latter laboratory constants can be used for modeling adsorption of inorganic As on Fe oxyhydroxides in natural waters.,True,rpf8oeQAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,253,https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.1991.36.7.1480,7654695699499870576,/scholar?cites=7654695699499870576,https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.4319/lo.1991.36.7.1480,0,0,0

Such measurements allow to understand the scavenging role of iron oxyhydroxide particles and give an insight on the role of organic matter on the coagulation of submicron colloids.

An order of magnitude for the sedimentation rate of iron particles in lakes has been determined.

Because of their dilution in the sediment matrix (typically 0.1–3.0% dry weight) and because no adequate separation technique was available until now. very little is known about their physico-chemical properties and so progress in the modelling of trace-element partitioning and cycling in aquatic sediments has been limited.
