1315492,Assessment of cow dung as a supplementary fuel in a downdraft biomass gasifier,2010,Prokash C Roy and Amitava Datta and Niladri Chakraborty,35,Renewable Energy,2,379-386,Pergamon,A model of downdraft gasifier has been described considering thermodynamic equilibrium of species in the pyro-oxidation zone and kinetically controlled reduction reactions in the reduction zone. It is found that the sole use of cow dung as the gasifier fuel is not technically feasible. This is due to very low heating value of the producer gas with much carbon leaving the gasifier as char. However. cow dung can be used as a supplementary fuel blended with a conventional woody biomass. like sawdust. The increased fraction of cow dung in the fuel blend renders the gasification process less efficient. when the gasifier is operated at a particular equivalence ratio. Both the producer gas production rate and its heating value reduce with the increase in the cow dung content in the biomass fuel blend. leading to an overall reduction in the gasifier conversion efficiency. It is observed that an increase in the cow dung content …,True,CnDnkBkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,64,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148109001256,10657080061340802423,/scholar?cites=10657080061340802423,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48973915/j.renene.2009.03.02220160919-6825-1yy4y3j.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,A model of a downdraft gasifier has been developed based on chemical equilibrium in the pyro‐oxidation zone and finite rate kinetic‐controlled chemical reactions in the reduction zone. The char reactivity factor (CRF) in the reduction zone. representing the number of active sites on the char and its degree of burn out. has been optimized by comparing the model predictions against the experimental results from the literature. The model predictions agree well with the temperature distribution and exit gas composition obtained from the experiments at CRF=100. A detailed parametric study has been performed at different equivalence ratios (between 2 and 3.4) and moisture content (in the range of 0–40%) in the fuel to obtain the composition of the producer gas as well as its heating value. It is observed that the heating value of the producer gas increases with the increase in the equivalence ratio and decrease in the …,True,CnDnkBkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,48,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/er.1517,14898965580285456909,/scholar?cites=14898965580285456909,,,,0,0,0

1315496,Role of biomass energy for sustainable development of rural India: case studies,2013,PC Roy,3,International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering,,577-582,,Biomass has a very high potential as a renewable energy resource because of its reliability and availability everywhere around the globe. It is the fourth highest primary energy resource in the world after oil. coal. and gas. contributing about 10.6% of the global primary energy supply. Many studies suggest that biomass can become an important primary energy source in the future global energy system. with dedicated biomass plantations being the major biomass supply source. Biomass can be converted into three main types of product: electrical/heat energy. transport fuel and chemical feedstock. Energy can be recovered from biomass either by direct combustion of the fuel or through initial gasification and subsequent combustion. Both methods are favoured because of its efficient and environment-friendly applications. Gasification is the process of generation of combustible mixture of H2. CO. CO2. CH4 and N2 with lower heating value commonly known as producer gas. These gases are used in many applications based on the conversion technology and fuel preparation. Biogas gas can also be generated by biochemical process to be utilized for cooking and engine operation.

The composition of different species (H2. CO. CO2. CH4. H2O. N2 and Char) and the temperature of the gas which flows from the pyro-oxidation to the reduction zone are obtained. Reduction zone has been modeled based on chemical kinetics of reduction reactions by char considering a large number of elemental control volumes along the length of the zone to predict final gas composition. The species and energy balances have been performed across each control volume considering the finite rate of chemical reactions. The contributions of ash in the fuel and heat loss from the downdraft gasifier have been considered in the energy balance equation.

A comparison has been established between the two flows occurring in the opposite direction. A twodimensional computational domain has been chosen for the analysis considering steady. laminar flow and Newtonian fluid.

Tar is an undesired byproduct because. once condensed. it can cause fouling and plugging and damage the downstream equipment. Thermochemical methods for tar destruction. which include catalytic cracking and thermal cracking. are intrinsically attractive because they are energetically efficient and no movable parts are required nor byproducts are produced. The main difficulty with these methods is the tendency for tar to polymerize at high temperatures. An alternative to tar removal is the complete combustion of the syngas in a porous burner directly as it leaves the particle capture system.

A number of deposit samples were subsequently analyzed on a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersion of x-ray detector. Results indicate that blending sawdust with coal decreases the deposition rate as compared with the firing of unblended coal due to both the sawdust low ash content and its low alkalis content. The co-combustion of coal and sawdust yields deposits with high levels of silicon and aluminium which indicates the presence of ashes with high fusion temperature and. thus. with less capacity to adhere to the surfaces. On the contrary. in the co-combustion of coal with olive stones the deposition rate increases as compared with the firing of unblended coal.

1315556,Context-aware generative adversarial privacy,2017,Chong Huang and Peter Kairouz and Xiao Chen and Lalitha Sankar and Ram Rajagopal,19,Entropy,12,656,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Preserving the utility of published datasets while simultaneously providing provable privacy guarantees is a well-known challenge. On the one hand. context-free privacy solutions. such as differential privacy. provide strong privacy guarantees. but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On the other hand. context-aware privacy solutions. such as information theoretic privacy. achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff. but assume that the data holder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP. learning the privacy mechanism is formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the individuals’ private variables. and an adversary that tries to infer the private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP’s performance. we investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models:(a) the binary data model; and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models. we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms. and show that the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion) match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can be easily applied in practice. even in the absence of dataset statistics.

On the one hand. the accommodation of solar generation can be highly improved on the demand side. On the other hand. SPHPs can efficiently provide heat energy for consumers. which reduces the operational costs of central heat supply from combined heat and power (CHP) units. In this paper. a planning framework is developed to evaluate the economic benefits of integrating SPHPs into a CHP system. The framework is formulated as a bilevel market equilibrium model. On the upper level. given the locational marginal prices (LMPs) and district heating prices (DHPs). the consumers at different buses will strategically invest in SPHPs.

The first challenge of this problem is: what are properties of a good user? In this project. we identify two aspects of a good user:1. First. a good user in a social network can be good simply because he is just generally good at producing quality content. On a Community Question Answering (CQA) such as stackoverflow. a good user is typically an expert who can provide good answers. Thus. goodness here equates to expertise [14]. On Twitter. a good user is usually an authoritative twitterer who can set the trend and influence many people. On Flickr. a good user can be a user who posts many high-quality photos. Meanwhile. on a chatting site like Chatous. a good user can just be a good conversationalist. With such diverse definitions of “user quality”. how can we quantify it?

Fossil fuels are generally classified as solid. liquid and gaseous fuels. The most known gaseous fuel is natural gas including high amount of energy. Natural gas plays an important role ranging from power generation industries to buildings. In general. power generation or heating systems consist of a combustor and a burner to burn natural gas. Because of that. burner and combustor designs are very important to burn the natural gas efficiently.Burners are generally separated into two groups called as premixed and diffusion (nonpremixed) burners. Reactants are mixed before the reaction is initiated in premixed flames as well as fuel and oxidizers enter the combustion chamber as separate streams in diffusion flames [1]. Both of them are widely used to burn natural gas or methane that is major component of natural gas in any combustion systems. van Essen et al.[2] have investigated effects of pressure on NO formation in premixed methane flame.

Eng,3,,,Self-cleaning behavior refers to the ability of a solid surface to remove contaminants under natural circumstances. This may be reached by two approaches. The former one is to achieve hydrophilic surfaces (water contact angle WCA< 90) on which water forms sheets. washing away impurities; the latter is to realize hydrophobic structures (WCA> 90). causing droplets to form and roll over the surface quickly. Many research efforts have been made to find the extreme limits of wetting and non-wetting behavior by the development of a wide variety of engineered surfaces with superhydrophilic (WCA approaching zero) and superhydrophobic (WCA> 150) properties.Hydrophophilic/superhydrophilic coatings are generally made up of metal oxides. These materials are all semiconductors activated by light of certain wavelengths. Titania-based films are by far the most investigated hydrophilic materials because of their abilities to reach the superhydrophilic state and chemically break down organic dirt when exposed to sunlight. thanks to their photocatalytic reactivity.

This study critiques Nigerian energy policy as housed in two recent main national energy policy documents. Most especially. we review the level of implementation and impact by presenting a potency check of the said policies under vital economic. environmental and domestic delivery/accessibility targets. We find the components of the national energy policy and relevant documents are largely adequate as it encompassed the necessary areas of attention. However. the reality on ground is that impact targets are still largely unmet primarily due to inconsistent political will and other socio-political issues. In addition. key to actualizing these targets with existing policy is to be majorly centered on electricity and oil & gas sector reforms. Going forward. major areas of continuous focus by further amendments to national energy policy are; continuous electric capacity expansion with increasing percentage of renewables. expansion of local oil refining capacity. efficient gas gathering/management and gas flaring eradication.

Therefore the internal combustion engine is a suitable option to be used in CHP systems. especially at drying agriculture product. In this present work. the waste heat of exhaust gas of an engine-generator was used for the process of orange slice drying. The drying kinetic of orange slices was studied at 4 engine load levels (25. 50. 75. and 100%) and at three levels of drying product thickness (3. 5. and 7mm) in a combined heat and power dryer system. The results showed that drying time decreased significantly with increasing the engine load and decreasing thickness of samples. The specific energy consumption of orange drying varied between 548.67-1404kWh/kgwater. The lowest value of SEC was observed at 75% engine load and thickness of 3 mm. Also. the performance of the engine with and without heat recovery is evaluated. It is found that nearly 11–19% of the total energy from the fuel input is saved using the heat recovery system. Analysis shows that an overall efficiency around 37% could be achieved with systems designed with simultaneous production for heat drying and electricity generation. Considering these results utilization CHP dryer is very suitable for significant energy saving performance.,True,pkywlogAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2963/3e407fcc28966185f8592e6334782a3f1f98.pdf,13065725324975221163,/scholar?cites=13065725324975221163,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2963/3e407fcc28966185f8592e6334782a3f1f98.pdf,0,0,0

Specifically. ferrimagnetic CoFe2O4 is integrated with multiferroic BiFeO3 and ferroelectric HfO2 (FE-HfO2). respectively. to create two distinct composite systems. The use of multiferroic BiFeO3 as the ferroelectric phase offers the potential of employing two interfacial coupling phenomena simultaneously. On the other hand. desirable ferroelectric property and superior Si-compatibility that FE-HfO2 can offer make it an intriguing material system for further implementation into device processing at an industrial scale.  In the CoFe2O4/BiFeO3 system. high-quality CoFe2O4 and BiFeO3 were synthesized on SrTiO3 (001) substrates via RE-ALD using TMHD-based metalorganic precursors (TMHD = 2.2.6.6-tetramethylheptane-3.5 dione) and atomic oxygen. With post-deposition thermal treatments. BiFeO3 exhibited epitaxial single-crystalline growth in its (001)pc orientation. Ferroelectric switching and measurable ferromagnetism confirmed the multiferroicity of BiFeO3. CoFe2O4 exhibited textured-polycrystalline growth with a ~10-nm epitaxial transition layer. which led to tunable ferrimagnetism with a thickness-related strain relaxation process. The CoFe2O4 thin films exhibited magnetic behavior that is comparable with the ones synthesized by other processing techniques as well as bulk crystals.

We surveyed pheasants during January-August 2003 using variable radius circular plots. line transects. and ad libitum sampling. We categorised forest blocks into large (5.000-10.000 ha). medium (1.000-5.000 ha). and small (< 1.000 ha) patches and considered the Bukit Barisan National Park (260.384 ha) as the source from which we measured patch isolation.

Sumatran peacock-pheasant Polyplectron chalcurum. crested fireback Lophura ignita. red junglefowl Gallus gallus and crested partridge Rollulus rouloul. The number of these species recorded in each forest patch varied between none and all five. The most common species was Sumatran peacock-pheasant. which was recorded in six patches and great argus pheasant. which was recorded in four forest patches. In general. more species occurred in the larger patches that were less isolated from other forests. All forest patches were highly disturbed by encroachment and illegal logging.

Lampung Province. This geothermal area is unique because the manifestation of hot springs that appear on the surface is in a relatively flat area. Geological observations on outcrops to determine the geological structure that control the hot springs are difficult to carry out due to limited rock outcrops. so geophysical methods are needed to interpret subsurface conditions such as gravity methods. The geology of the study area is covered by Lampung Formation consists of pyroclastic-volcaniclastic rocks with thickness reaching 200 m. The result of gravity data processing shows the value of Bouguer anomaly which ranges from 51.0 to 62.6 mGal. The interpretation of Bouguer's anomaly data shows five fault structures predominate northwest-southeast and north-south trend. which act as the water path discharge.

Half the area has been permanently set aside for nature. including extensive areas of pristine peat dome pole forest (PDPF) that grows on the raised surface of large ground-water domes. Permanent sample plots (PSP) established in PDPF have gained 16-32% in basal area (BA) since 2008. raising a question of where in a rain-fed organic landscape the minerals for biomass expansion have come from. Physical and chemical analysis indicates that mineral stores in the peat topsoil are relatively small while litter stores are more substantial. Rain while quite clean is abundant; quantities of cations sampled in rainfall appear to be adequate to have supplied the observed expansion of biomass. Soil drainage and subsidence may have stimulated biomass growth of one fastest grown PSP but not of a second one. Other potential sources of nutrient are air borne particulate haze that reaches nuisance levels each dry season. and guano from roosting fruit bats. Historical disturbance and subsequent recovery of PDPF cannot be ruled out.

1315752,Unruly landscapes: politics of biodiversity. energy and livelihoods in India,2016,Shikha Lakhanpal,,,,,,Global concerns on climate change mitigation and reduction in emissions are influencing sustainable projects worldwide. The global discourse on sustainability is manifested locally in various forms that re-arrange human-environment relationships. Such ‘green geographies’ are inevitably rooted in territoriality and are operationalized through controlling access to natural resources. The re-working of the spatial arrangements demarcating control over access to natural resources can pose a threat to local livelihoods that depend on nature. For projects located next to areas of conservation concern. it necessitates a political process of prioritization between conservation. development and livelihoods. In this dissertation. I focus on the re-working of these green geographies.   I examine cases of local opposition against renewable power projects that are located in or around areas of prime conservation.  The case sites are located in the Western Ghats and near the Great Himalayan National Park in India. I argue that these green geographies are inherently dynamic and democracy provides the context within which these landscapes are contested and re-defined.  Further. I argue that the introduction of renewable energy projects in pre-territorialized landscapes reorients spatial arrangements. resulting in a re-territorialization of these geographies. Further. I position this re-territorialization as an outcome of intense political wrangling that traverses multiple scales and is influenced by the larger politics of environment and development at higher scales.

Dissipation of parts of this energy into the substrate bulk drives the thermalization of surface species. but also constitutes a potentially unwanted loss channel. At present. little is known about the underlying microscopic dissipation mechanisms and their (relative) efficiency. At metal surfaces. prominent such mechanisms are the generation of substrate phonons and the electronically non-adiabatic excitation of electron–hole pairs.

However. given the complex structure of most porous carbons and the poor oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) selectivity typically observed when they are used as catalysts. it is still unclear which carbon defects are responsible for the high two-electron ORR activity typically observed in these materials.

Comparing the hot adatom diffusion ensuing O 2 dissociation over Pd (100) and Pd (111) we find experimentally accessible product end distances to form a rather misleading measure for the lifetime of this hyperthermal state. The lifetime is particularly long at Pd (111) where a random-walk-type diffusion leads only to small net displacements.

Experiments in the sustainable use of such residues are highly relevant in social and environmental terms. stimulating widespread interest and debate. with considerable research going into sustainability projects. In many areas. however. adequate public funding for sustainable-use projects is hard to come by. One of the major reasons for this is that public authorities. particularly in times of financial constraints. are reluctant to invest in undertakings in which the economic returns are difficult to quantify. Official scrutiny of the expenditures of public authorities is also normally heavily influenced by cost-benefit analyses.

The objectives of the project were the adequate disposal of solid urban waste as well as the generation of employment and income. The COMLURB Project had economic. environmental and social facets. and the researchers sought to establish whether COMLURB had prepared reports that would enable evaluation of the investment made and the results obtained. In particular. the researchers sought to establish whether COMLURB financial statements set out the results of actions inherent to the CSR.

This seems to be the case in Brazil that with a new regulation. it still attempts to eradicate the inadequate waste disposal for open dumps. Thus. the aim of this paper is to depict the context. the criteria and discuss the strategies used for: the municipalities achieve the goals and adhere the plan; choice and configuration of disposal sites; and economic instruments adopted and bringing the whole scenario to discussion. including methane emissions inventory thru the case study of the Rio de Janeiro State. The Rio de Janeiro State municipal solid waste management scenario has drastically changed in last five years from 9% of residues sent to adequate destinations. to the perspective of eradication of open dumps before the end of 2014. The results indicate that only adequate disposal of waste is mandatory with the prevalence of the sanitation approach. The evidences also indicate that planning goals to reduce waste are modest and the landfill gas recover is generally accepted as the optimal solution. This paper concludes that. unless the stakeholders add to the plan a more aggressive policy to increment. the competitiveness of other waste technologies that favor the landfilling reduction and energy recover.

The oxygen enrichment of inlet air to reduce the HC and CO emissions and humidifying the inlet air to control NOX emissions was applied. The intake air oxygen concentration was increased from 21% to 25% by 2% interval. The oxygen enrichment of the engine inlet air increased the combustion rate. and thus combustion improved. and thermal efficiency increased. This situation led to a reduction in HC emissions and CO emissions. However. the combustion improvement caused a striking rise in NOX emissions because of the high cylinder temperature and high oxygen concentration. This undesirable effect was tried to be alleviated by adiabatic humidification of the engine inlet air.

Wheat germ oil (WGO) and pine oil (PO) have been identified as diesel fuel surrogates with high and low viscosities. respectively. High viscosity biofuels result in incomplete combustion due to poor atomisation and evaporation which ultimately leads to insufficient air-fuel mixing to form a combustible mixture. Consequently. engines running on this type of fuel suffer from lower brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and higher soot emission.

1315842,Development of enhanced power generation for piezoelectric energy harvesting,2019,Nathan Counsell and Yong Chen and Mohammad Reza Herfatmanesh,,Wednesday 17 April 2019,,11,,Energy harvesting is gaining significant interest from industry. which is driving research within this area. This interest has been attributed to the development of ultra-low-power electronics and the Internet of Things (IoT)[1]. The use of energy harvesting allows products to be relatively versatile for remote sensing applications. There are four major energy harvesting methods; inductive (electromagnetic). thermoelectric. photo-voltaic and piezoelectric. All these methods except piezoelectric energy harvesting depend upon the use of batteries to store energy to power electrical devices. In the case of piezoelectric energy harvesters. significant instantaneous power can be generated. allowing for battery-less operation [2. 3]. Previous authors have investigated buckling structures for bi-stable cantilever structures [4-6]. This research investigates the effect of mono-stable buckling on the electrical output energy of a piezoelectric transducer. The investigation focused on the commercially available piezoelectric-ceramic; Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT-5A). due to its low cost and high energy output which are crucial for commercial exploitation of the product. A bespoke punch and die tool was designed and manufactured to transform commercial piezoelectric transducers into mono-stable buckling energy harvesters. To characterise the buckling transducers. a bespoke clamp was designed and manufactured to provide simply supported clamping conditions on the edges of the piezoelectric transducers while a tensile machine with a point load was employed to measure the buckling force. The measured buckling force was then used to identify the output …,True,0VS4fP4AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/21692/Proceedings_of_Abstracts_ECS_2019.pdf?sequence=1#page=19,,,,,https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/21692/Proceedings_of_Abstracts_ECS_2019.pdf?sequence=1#page=19,0,0,0

In response to legislative. social and environmental pressures. there is a large body of engine research work demonstrating the energy saving and emissions reducing benefits of advanced fuel injection strategies. However. the effects of such injection modes on the fuel injection system’s performance must be thoroughly examined and compensated for since the combustion and the formation of exhaust pollutants are directly influenced by the spatial and temporal distribution of the fuel within the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. The aim of this study was to investigate the hydraulic effects of two-stage injection in a high-speed direct injection single-cylinder optical diesel engine. The fuel injection system was characterised for all the tested strategies through the measurement of the fuel injection rate and quantity. in particular. the interaction between the two consecutive fuel injection events was quantified. The effects of two-stage injection and dwell angle on diesel combustion and emissions were investigated using heat release analysis and direct high-speed imaging technique. The results indicated that the total fuel injection quantity can vary by as much as 40% under certain operating conditions. Nevertheless. the results indicated that this injection mode has the potential to improve fuel economy and engine performance while substantially reducing the combustion noise. provided that the fuel injection system is thoroughly calibrated and the injection timings are …,True,0VS4fP4AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1337439550551055326&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

1315877,Life cycle check as a decision support tool for medical waste management in underdeveloped areas of Africa,2002,David EC Rogers and Mark B Rohwer and Alan Colin Brent,,,,,WasteCon,In most developing countries. the emphasis for health care has moved to community preventative services and away from district curative health services. e.g. immunization. Sterilization and reuse is being replaced with single use and disposal to minimize the risk of cross infection. This has lead to larger amounts of infectious waste in underdeveloped areas. The responsible authorities and agencies do not have waste management infrastructure to safely handle and dispose of the waste. Although not recognised as a significant problem before. health care professionals now require allocation of funds that were previously not identified. In Africa where much of the health care currently receives donor funds. these professionals are also obliged to comply with national regulations and international protocols for waste disposal. mostly only known to specialist waste management practitioners. In order to address these problems a Check List has been developed for planning at District. Regional. and National Managerial levels. using a Streamlined Life Cycle Analysis (SLCA) according to ISO 14040. SLCA can evaluate parameters of the waste life cycle qualitatively and thereby reduce the time and cost of conducting a comprehensive. quantitative life cycle analysis. The SLCA was compiled from data obtained through a case study of an African country and was used to evaluate different management options for health care waste in such a country.

The main drivers for countries to pursue this field are the need to create more energy independence and to address environmental issues. An important aspect of the hydrogen economy is the use of fuel cells. which is a device that converts chemical energy.for example hydrogen. directly into electrical energy. without the need to burn fuel to create the steam or gas that drives a generator. Functioning similarly to a battery. which uses electrochemical conversion. fuel cells take in hydrogen-   rich fuel and oxygen and turn them into electricity and heat. The hydrogen used can be derived from gasoline. natural gas. propane or methanol. Within the CSIR and within South Africa's government and industry. it has been realised that research into fuel cells is important for South Africa for the same reasons as in other countries.

1315883,Microwave-assisted pechini synthesis of Pd-Ni nanocatalyst for ethanol electro-oxidation in alkaline medium,2012,Mark B Rohwer and Kenneth Ozoemena and Remegia M Modibedi,,,,,,Fuel cells provide a means for the direct conversion of fuels to electricity. Direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) are particularly attractive because liquid fuels such as methanol or ethanol have a relatively low cost. a high volumetric energy density. and they are easily handled and stored. Ethanol is not only less toxic than methanol. but can be produced from renewable resources. which makes it a promising fuel. Alkaline DAFCs also have the potential for better oxygen reduction kinetics than their acidic counterparts. For these reasons. electrocatalysts for the oxidation of ethanol in alkaline medium deserve special attention. Pd and its alloys. e.g. Pd-Ni. have been investigated widely as catalysts for ethanol electro-oxidation. and form the subject of this paper. Although Pd-Ni nanocatalysts have been well reported. there is no report on the use of the so-called Pechini method to prepare them. The Pechini process is based on a sol-gel route whereby an aqueous solution of suitable oxides or salts is mixed with an alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acid such as citric acid and a polyhydroxy alcohol such as ethylene glycol. Upon heating. a polymer matrix forms and the metal is at least partially reduced. The result. after pyrolysis of the polymer. is a finely dispersed metal (or metal oxide). as is typically required for catalysis. Microwave treatment has been used on a wide range of chemical reactions. including catalyst synthesis. However. no report could be found of its use in conjunction with the Pechini synthesis of Pd-Ni electrocatalysts for ethanol oxidation.

Ammonium quaternized polymers such as poly (arylene ether sulfones) are being developed and studied as candidates of ionomeric materials for AMFCs. due to their low cost and promising electrochemical properties. However. the performance of AMFC based on this type of membrane is still low due to easy degradation in alkaline medium at temperatures above 60 C.

Currently. CdTe photovoltaic panels are not included in European regulations limiting elements considered dangerous and regulating their disposal. In terms of environmental impact. previous studies showed that the CdTe modules have similar or less impact than other photovoltaic technologies and have a lower energy consumption relative to the production stage. Indeed. these studies are developed on the only energetic return and EPBT (Energy Pay-Back Time) basis. and they do not take into account the effects related to heavy metals pollution. In this context. the CIGS (Copper Indium Gallium di-Selenide) and amorphous/micromorph MCPH thin-film silicon technologies showed to have an environmental impact comparable to that of CdTe and in some cases even less. The lack of ascertained data on the extent of risks associated with production. use and disposal stages of these panels and the fast technological progress of solar technologies make difficult. but necessary to outline a reliable framework and to assess a balance between risks and benefits in the use photovoltaic modules …,True,NxX_CCMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,26,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Laura_Parisi/publication/244485998_Life_cycle_assessment_of_advanced_technologies_for_photovoltaic_panel_production/links/00b49521e0b25b1c52000000.pdf,4235937956957312683,/scholar?cites=4235937956957312683,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Laura_Parisi/publication/244485998_Life_cycle_assessment_of_advanced_technologies_for_photovoltaic_panel_production/links/00b49521e0b25b1c52000000.pdf,0,0,0
1315895,On sustainability in practice: a possible interpretation through the application and use of the ISEW,2009,Federico M Pulselli and Mirko Bravi and Enzo Tiezzi,,From GDP to Well-Being” international conference December,,,,The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) was introduced by H. Daly and J. Cobb in 1989 in order to integrate the information embodied in GDP. Since economic growth implies externalities and market failures. and a portion of it can be defined as “uneconomic”. the ISEW method introduces some corrections and adjustments to the GDP calculation framework. The ISEW has been calculated for a number of nations but it has been rarely applied to sub-national systems. Its calculation at the local level is important especially in case of administrative decentralization. and autonomy and responsibility of local authorities in certain fields. For this reason. a more and more comprehensive knowledge of the characteristics and peculiarities of the territorial system they manage is necessary.

Among biofuels. biodiesel has gained considerable attention as the need to develop alternatives to traditional diesel fuel increases. The Italian parliament adopted directive 2003/30/CE from the European Parliament. in which the guidelines about future production and consumption of biofuels are reported: 1% and 2.5% of biofuels within 2005 and 2010 respectively. The aim of this work is to investigate the reduction in greenhouse gas emission obtained by using biodiesel in agricultural practises. and the role of renewable energy use at a local scale. Comparison between diesel and sunflower methyl ester was made from the point of view of an emission inventory. from production and combustion. by using different scientific tools. such as IPCC methodology and the Danish Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) EDIP Database.

This new model attributes contact angle saturation to repulsion between trapped charges on the cap and base surfaces of the droplet in the vicinity of the three-phase contact line. which prevents these surfaces from converging during contact angle reduction. This repulsion-based saturation is similar to repulsion between charges accumulated on the surfaces of conducting droplets which causes the well known Coulombic fission and Taylor cone formation phenomena. In our model. both the droplet and dielectric coating were treated as lossy dielectric media (i.e.. having finite electrical conductivities and permittivities) contrary to the more common assumption of a perfectly conducting droplet and perfectly insulating dielectric.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) test has been conducted to ensure that the reaction gives good results of glycerol and methyl ester (biofuel). The biodiesel fuel was produced by mixing biofuel with different amounts of diesel. Improvement of biodiesel using variable blending ratios:(B5. B10. B15. B20. and B30) was studied. The produced biodiesel fuel was evaluated in terms of its thermo physical and chemical characteristics such as flash point. firing point. and calorific value. Results showed that the produced biodiesel has similar properties with diesel fuel. Results are compared with other published experimental data.,True,nmO9e3kAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC,4,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3532004655074088608&hl=en&oi=scholarr,3532004655074088608,/scholar?cites=3532004655074088608,,,,0,0,0

The room was made from wood material except the south wall. Trombe Wall; it is composed from a commercial glass wall apart from masonry thick wall with a small gap. The experimental observations show using solar chimney can maintain the room at lower temperature than the ambient with small variations along the day period. Along the day period it was seen the values of the air velocity using air gap of 5 cm width higher than when using air gap of 10 cm width. The performance of solar chimney with air gap of 5 cm width is more appropriated compared with solar chimney with air gap of 10 cm width. Thus. this system can be recommended to remove undesirable interior heat pollution from a building and provide thermal comfort for the occupant.

This paper concentrates only on the mathematical model for the porous medium and its solution using a finite-volume approach. The previous studies dealt with wick medium with high water content and liquid saturation in the wick medium was not determined. A physical model for the initially saturated porous medium was developed. The model takes into consideration the salt concentration in the solution. surface and internal water diffusions to humid air with vapor pressure determined from vapor mass balance. The system of transient one-dimensional differential equations was developed together with the boundaries and initial conditions. A finite-volume method was used for discretisation of the differential equations. A fully-implicit scheme was used for unsteady term discretisation while the convective terms (liquid solution. vapor and dry air) in the energy equation are handled by an upwind scheme method. The nonlinear equations are solved simultaneously by updating the coefficients matrix at one time step until the five variables converge to prescribed tolerance.

Faculty of Engineering,This paper presents the application of an adaptive fuzzy logic controller with feed-forwardcomponent (AFLCF) to the Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA Robot). The feedforward torque component is computed on-line using an artificial neural network (ANN) which hasbeen trained off-line. This feed-forward component is designed to deliver the ideal torquecomponent to the robot derivers. The feedback fuzzy logic control (FLC) component is made tokeep the stability of the closed loop system. As the FLC is dependent in its rule base. here. acompact rule base is used. It consists of only four rules per each degree of freedom (DOF). The FLCensures closed loop stability in the sense of Lyapunov and is valid for second order nonlinearsystems. Furthermore. adaptability of the FLC has been achieved to enhance the trackingperformance. The theoretical background of this control algorithm has been published in[1].Using SCARA robot as the testing platform. here. experimental results are presented for thefollowing five controllers: the conventional PD controller.

Estimates of the size of the Mexican informal economy vary between 27 to 49% of GDP depending on the method of measurement. Given the size of its share of the economy. it is expected that the informal economy will have an impact of the environment. This paper models pollution demand of the informal economy in 2454 Mexican municipalities and tests whether output generated by the shadow economy produces a significant environmental impact. We test the effectiveness of regulation to reduce the size of the informal economy in order to reduce its environmental impact. Our findings suggest that the impact of informal economies on the environment is significant. and that developing a sustainable informal economy may be possible through the combined efforts of government. society. and organizational/managerial alternatives.,True,EUyTP2wAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,3,http://daac.itam.mx/sites/default/files/informal_economy-lloret.pdf,3196053662034010971,/scholar?cites=3196053662034010971,,,http://daac.itam.mx/sites/default/files/informal_economy-lloret.pdf,0,0,0

We challenge the assumption that regulation aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the form of a target to meet the Country’s GHG emissions commitments will promote sustainable corporations. We argue that. in fact. such regulation may impair sustainability practices because it creates unintended consequences. This paper tackles the efficiency of the institutional framework chosen through the lenses of the analytical themes of fit. scale. and interplay. then we use a systems dynamic approach to represent how regulation in the arenas of energy efficiency and GHG emissions reduction may withhold competitive business outcomes and corporate sustainability schemes. We exemplify and simulate a single regulation scheme: a clean energy target for firms; and found that as a result of such scheme. the system is dominated by negative feedback processes resulting in lesser outcomes that would be better tackled by firms not being subject to the restrictions imposed by the regulation.

Economic theory on water reserves calls for increase investment as the variance of the water flow increases. as expected by climate change; but it is not clear how much investment and for what rate of changes in mean and variance of water flow. We develop an analytical method to analyze the effects in optimal reservoir capacity for various climatic change conditions that alter the current mean and variance of water flow. We estimate an optimal reservoir capacity by stochastic dynamic programming and parameterize the model with real time data from five major reservoirs in Northern California. We illustrate that for a decrease in annual mean inflow with no corresponding change in standard deviation our results suggests a need to increase reservoir capacity; however we show that if the decrease in the mean is met with a corresponding decrease in the standard deviation no change in reservoir size is required.,True,EUyTP2wAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,1,http://daac.itam.mx/sites/default/files/u105/daac_-_reservoir_capacity_wp_v030811.pdf,5471018966276015832,/scholar?cites=5471018966276015832,,,http://daac.itam.mx/sites/default/files/u105/daac_-_reservoir_capacity_wp_v030811.pdf,0,0,0

These schemes are formalized by institutional agreements that usually operate in uncertain hydrologic and variable sociodemographic conditions. Should the rate of change of the conditions governing the natural resource be faster than the rate at which formal institutions adapt. the chance of conflicts among governments is likely to increase.

Thus users rely on other institutional schemes. namely informal agreements. which are policy instruments used by governments to overcome crises. uncertain events. or variable conditions not always considered in formal agreements.

Herein we report the incorporation of Au nanocages (AuNCs) into electrospun nanofibers of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) for efficient water evaporation via photothermal heating. Because PVDF is highly hydrophobic. its nonwoven mat naturally floats on the surface of water. Upon irradiation with a near-infrared (NIR) laser at 808 nm. the water at the surface is heated to evaporate while the bulk remains at the ambient temperature.

Using a sample of 460 firm-year observations for multinational firms over the 2002–2006 period. we find that the R&D decentralization may enhance the shareholders’ wealth and increase the managers’ one. The results show that the R&D geographic diversification increases the informational asymmetry and support the emergence of the favourable conditions for the earnings management and the managers’ entrainment. It may increase the managers’ autonomy which likely allows them to manage the result in order to increase their own wealth and destruct the shareholder’s one.,True,f6OnJvoAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,21,https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=202191,6707975513150143173,/scholar?cites=6707975513150143173,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3846/1611-1699.2008.9.199-205,0,0,0

1315982,R&D Investment. Governance and Management Entrenchment,2019,Abderrazak Dhaoui and Fathi Jouini,6,International Journal of Financial Economics and Econometrics,2,69-90,,The management entrenchment is a deliberated behavior realized by the manager considered as more informed actor which consists of serving own interests at the expense of the shareholders as less informed actors. It takes different forms. The first consists of influencing the accounting results by increasing or decreasing them according to individual needs. The second consists of increasing the specific investment to let the information asymmetry between shareholders and managers more complex. which helps these later to maintain their stations long term. The agency theory (Fama. 1980; Jensen et Meckling. 1976; Jensen et Murphy. 1990) examines this subject on the level of the agency conflicts characterizing the relationship between managers. shareholders and creditors. It insists on several control systems limiting the differences of opinions and interests. The confrontation of this theory to the entrenchment one explains why some control systems are ineffective when managers serve their own interests at the expense of shareholders. This is to say that the integration of the entrenchment theory hypotheses contributes to determine the limits of the mechanisms of control exerted on the managers to incite them to act in the interest of their principal (Alexandre and Paquerot. 2000).The analysis of the control systems exerted to influence the management behavior is essential to the comprehension of the organization’s function and its performance (Alexandre and Paquerot. 2000).

Taking into account both world oil production and world oil prices in order to supervise for oil supply and oil demand shocks. strong evidence of the sensitivity of stock market returns to the oil price shock specifications is found in several sub-periods. As for rolling window causality tests. it is found that the impact of oil price shocks substantially differs along the different countries and that the results also differ among the various oil shock specifications. The overall finding suggests that oil supply shocks have a negative effect on stock market returns in the net oil importing OECD countries. Indeed. the stock market returns are negatively impacted by oil demand shocks in the oil importing OECD countries and positively impacted by the oil exporting OECD countries.

UCLA recently began offering an online master’s degree program in computer science. which includes a course in computer security. This motivated the design of online coursework intended to take the place of the traditional in-class homework and group projects. The resulting security labs use standard security tools and the DETER testbed. which can be organized into networks of physical machines running real software. In these environments. students perform open-ended exercises involving file permissions. firewalls. software vulnerabilities. eavesdropping and injection. man-in-the-middle attacks. computer forensics. and network intrusion detection systems.

1316022,Datacomp: Transparently Improving Efficiency with Adaptive Compression Ph. D. Prospectus,2011,Peter AH Peterson,,,,,,Efficient use of finite resources such as space. time. and energy has been a key goal for computing since the beginning. as users have always wanted maximum utility from their limited hardware. While hardware changes can directly improve efficiency. software efficiency strategies are in some ways harder to develop. First. they must save more resources than they cost. Then. practical obstacles must be overcome. New techniques must be compelling in order to drive acceptance and justify implementation costs. Sometimes. old concepts such as non-lossy compression can be combined with new insights to great effect. Historically used to save space. compression can also save time and energy when the savings resulting from smaller payloads can cover the costs of compression. However. while the savings can be considerable. it is hard to predict whether a particular compression operation is a good investment. As a result. compression is normally disabled by default. Even when manually enabled for a task. one static compression strategy is typically applied to the task regardless of utility. Because of this unintelligent.“all or nothing” approach and the dynamism of live computer systems. profitable opportunities for compression are regularly overlooked. Yet at the same time. compression when used is often suboptimal or wasteful.Efficiently predicting when compression can save resources is hard—but not impossible. In this dissertation proposal. I describe the motivations and proposed design. implementation. and evaluation of Datacomp. a general adaptive compression framework.

Although action is needed at all levels of governance. local authorities play a key role in climate action. The creation of sustainable energy and climate action plans at the local level are recent trends that show increasing local commitment. During the last decade. several municipalities have started to develop plans. but surprisingly little systematic technical guidance has been provided to them. As part of an effort to develop tools to assist energy planning at the local level. this study addresses the role of indicators in energy planning.

Local authorities have an important role to play in promoting sustainable energy systems. Initiatives emerging in the European Union and in other parts of the world. such as the Covenant of Mayors or the Clinton Climate Initiative. stress the fact that cities are important actors for implementing sustainable energy policies and their actions must be encouraged and supported. However. current processes of energy planning and assessment at the local level are still lacking a common and systematic methodology for the evaluation of energy sustainability. The development of energy and climate change policies. as well as the implementation of sustainable energy action plans. stresses the need for monitoring and reporting the progress towards sustainable energy goals. This paper presents a review on how energy is included in the main sets of sustainable development indicators and discusses its commonalities and differences. It also addresses the issues of applicability and measurability at the local level. since most of the energy indicators were designed to be used at the national level. It then attempts to identify existing gaps in the evaluation of local energy sustainability. and ends up with a proposal of a core set of indicators that can be used to assess in a comprehensive way the performance of local energy systems.

1316028,Decision Support Methodology for Local Sustainable Energy Planning,2013,Ana Rita Fragoso Neves,,,,,,First initiatives of energy and climate action at the local level can be tracked back into the 1990s. Although. only in the last decade integrated local energy planning initiatives have gained greater expression. A number of energy or climate action plans have been materialising on the ground. while the topic has not deserved the corresponding attention on the scientific literature so far. The new energy paradigm calls for a need to focus on the energy services for which energy is actually demanded and to identify the appropriate energy carriers and technologies to satisfy those services. Energy has several implications in sustainable development and thus a holistic perspective to local energy systems is deemed necessary. Hence. this thesis builds on the need to improve local energy planning processes by proposing a decision support methodology for local sustainable energy planning. The focus is on providing an energy services-oriented modelling approach and a solid and comprehensive basis for evaluating alternative energy action plans. Since energy planning is a decision process. it involves choices regarding the future of the community. In order to make well-weighted choices it is important to include the values and preferences of the local actors into the energy planning process.During this research. several methods from different disciplines were reviewed in order to identify the most suited combination to satisfy the methodology’s requirements.

1316033,The Water-Energy-Food Nexus Index: A Tool for Integrated Resource Management and Sustainable Development,2020,Gareth Simpson and Graham Jewitt and William Becker and Jessica Badenhorst and Ana Neves and Pere Rovira and Victor Pascual,,,,,OSF Preprints,The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus has. in the past decade. gained prominence as an approach for assessing integrated resource management. One challenge related to the WEF nexus approach is how to represent and monitor it since a system that includes water-. energy-and food-related parameters is complex. Not only are these resources quantified utilising different units. but they vary both spatially and temporally. This paper presents a national-level composite indicator that has been established for 170 countries. utilising the methodology developed by the Joint Research Centre: Competence Centre on Composite Indicators and Scoreboards. Following an assessment of 87 globally applicable water-. energy-and food-related indicators. 21 were selected to constitute the WEF Nexus Index. This index is made up of three equally weighted pillars representing the three constituent resource sectors. and six sub-pillars. A core element in the development of this index is equitable access to resources. which is characterised by each resource sector's ‘access’ sub-pillar. The WEF Nexus Index provides a quantitative perspective and offers a lens for evaluating trade-offs to be considered in the pursuit of sustainable development. To this end. it is intended for assessing national progress relating to integrated resource management as well as supporting decision making and policy development. The relevance and usefulness of the outcomes are demonstrated through an assessment of South Africa. The development of the WEF Nexus Index has demonstrated that no country is undertaking integrated resource management flawlessly.

The prosthesis comprises motorized ankle and subtalar joints. and is capable of emulating some key biomechanical behaviors exhibited by the anklefoot complex during rock climbing maneuvers. The free space motion of the device is volitionally controlled via input from EMG surface electrodes embedded in a custom silicone liner worn on the residual limb. The device range of motion is 0.29 radians of each dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. and 0.39 radians each of inversion and eversion. Preliminary evaluation of the device was conducted. validating the system mass of 1292 grams. build height of 250 mm. joint velocity of 2.18 radians/second. settling time of 120 milliseconds. and steady state error of 0.008 radians.

This method allows for continuous. in-field convergence on an optimal terrain prediction accuracy for a given walking condition. and is thus not limited by the specific conditions and limited sample size of an in-lab training scheme. Methods: We asked one subject with a below-knee amputation to traverse level ground. stairs. and ramps using a high-range-of-motion powered prosthesis while internal sensor data were remotely logged. We then used these data to develop a dynamic classification algorithm which predicts the terrain of each stride and then continuously updates the predictor using both data from the previous stride and an accurate terrain back-estimation algorithm. Results: Across 100 simulations randomizing stride order. our method attained a mean next-stride prediction accuracy of? 96%. This value was first reached after? 200 strides. or about? 5 minutes of walking. Conclusion and significance: These results demonstrate a method for automatically learning the gait patterns preceding terrain transitions in a prosthesis without relying on any external devices.

1316103,Discrete cellular lattice assembly,2015,Matthew Eli Carney,,,,,,Robotic assembly of discrete cellular lattices at super-hertz (>1Hz) assembly rates is shown to be possible by integrating the design of a modular robotic assembler with the specified lattice topology such that the lattice can itself be removed from the incremental assembly process. Limits to assembly rates are ultimately dependent on allowable error. system stiffness. and damping characteristics. Vibrations due to cyclical motions of the end-effector. locomotion system. and the dynamic response of an incrementally varying lattice must settle to acceptable ranges to enable engagement between end-effectors. discrete elements. and their affixing features to adjacent cells. For given system dynamics. longer settling times enables greater energy dissipation. and less error. With a greater allowable error at the interface. a shorter assembly cycle period can be attained. Passive alignment features designed into the robot end-effectors. locomotion systems. and the discrete lattice elements reduce the precision requirements of the assembly process by opening up the acceptable error range. thereby. enabling higher assembly cycle-rates. An experiment was performed to evaluate how an assembler locally referencing a lattice performed in comparison to a globally referenced assembler.

Council Energy Efficient Econ.(ECEEE’11) Summer Study,,1739-1750,,Energy consumed by households in Europe (EU27) accounts for 26% of final energy consumption (EEA 2010). As electricity consumption continues to grow-driven by an increase in consumer appliances and electronics and a rising demand for air conditioning-households offer room for energy efficiency improvements (EEA 2010). The challenge is to harvest efficiency gains.The deployment of smart meters in Europe is accompanied by an increased interest from consumers for real-time information regarding their electricity consumption. Such deployments are slowly enabling a “smart-grid” infrastructure and leading to the modification of traditional market roles. Our study assesses the impact of information on behaviours involving electricity consumption. The study. which ran from July 2009 to September 2010. involved 22 households (12 treatments and 10 controls). The experiment followed a quasi-experimental design with random assignment of volunteers between treatment and control groups (adhesion: 7%; abandonment rate: 35%).,True,cor_4J8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,9,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joana_Abreu2/publication/266203519_A_contribution_to_better_understand_the_demand_for_electricity_in_the_residential_sector/links/542a0e800cf29bbc126774bb.pdf,5891571700194738655,/scholar?cites=5891571700194738655,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joana_Abreu2/publication/266203519_A_contribution_to_better_understand_the_demand_for_electricity_in_the_residential_sector/links/542a0e800cf29bbc126774bb.pdf,0,0,0

However. human operators may take actions. which can be far from optimum. because of stressful situations and other factors affecting their performance in time-sensitive and critical situations such as reacting to contingencies with significant monetary and social impact. In this paper. we present an analytic framework based on a Markov chain for modeling the dynamics of an infrastructure under contingencies. while capturing the effects of operators behavior quantified by the probability of human error under various circumstances. In particular. we have focused on the power grid infrastructure and cascading failures as contingencies. We particularly leveraged the observations and information obtained from interviews with power-system operators to develop our model and identify its parameters.

Residential DR projects that take advantage of connected devices offer an array of mostly untapped opportunities to reduce peak demand. The Smart Home segment has been steadily growing over the past few years. This includes both large and small appliances provided they are connected to the internet. According to one source. the penetration of stand-alone and integrated Smart Homes is predicted to reach 13.6% in 2019 [2]. On the other hand. the rate of ownership of smart thermostats by broadband homes reached 13% in December 2017 [3]. The growing customer interest in connected devices. together with home energy storage and electric vehicle charging are all contributing factors for the forecasted opportunity of 88 gigawatts of residential demand flexibility in the United States by 2023 [4]. However. for demand response programs to be cost-effective. extensive customer participation is required. To achieve this potential and support the design of effective and inclusive demand response programs it is necessary to study the attitudes. the barriers and the incentives that promote customer enrollment.In collaboration with National Grid.

For example. research has found that giving someone a potentially energy efficient programmable thermostat does not necessarily mean that they will save energy (Malinick. et al.. 2012). Every day practices influence the way people use energy. because to accomplish the same everyday objective (for example cook dinner) comparable individuals may engage in practices that demand energy in a very different way. A lifestyle based on microwaving meals v. hold fashion cooking is an example of practices that involve very different amounts of energy consumption to provide for the same basic need.

1316149,Understanding the Impact of User Effort on Electricity Feedback and Energy Savings. Harvard Botanical Gardens Study,2013,J. Abreu and J. Feldman and K. Roth,,,,,,Residential energy consumption accounts for 22% of the United States’ total energy demand (Ehrhardt-Martinez. et al.. 2010). Despite trends of increasing electricity consumption. residential buildings are potential targets for substantial electricity savings (Dietz. et al.. 2009). Given current policy trends and savings potential. models predict that residential. commercial. and industrial buildings could curb electricity consumption to an annual growth rate of 0.83% for 2008 to 2030. down from the current projected growth rate of 1.07%(Siddiqui. 2009). By giving immediate visibility to otherwise invisible consequences of consumption. feedback has been shown to be an effective method of promoting wholehome energy savings of between 4% and 12%(Ehrhardt-Martinez. et al.. 2010). Despite the significant potential for savings in this area. numerous studies on energy feedback have shown that a key outstanding problem is how to maintain energy savings and user engagement over the long-term. Users need to stay personally motivated to keep interacting with the information (Fogg. 2009). and the novelty of a new technology often diminishes quickly after an initial period of effectiveness (LaMarche. et al.. 2012). Therefore. even though initial energy savings may be found. they often decrease or disappear after a few months.Fogg (2009) proposes a framework for behavior change that relies on three components: 1) motivation. the propensity to engage in a specific action. 2) ability. the technical and cognitive capacity to perform a specific action. and 3) triggers that facilitate and spark engagement.

1316151,Moving up the waste hierarchy: Car boot sales. reuse exchange and the challenges of consumer culture to waste prevention,2013,Nicky Gregson and Mike Crang and Jennifer Laws and Tamlynn Fleetwood and Helen Holmes,77,"Resources, conservation and recycling",,97-107,Elsevier,Moving up the waste hierarchy is a key priority for UK waste policy. Waste prevention requires policy interventions to promote reuse. The term ‘reuse exchange’ has been adopted by UK policy makers to describe a variety of second-hand trading outlets including car boot sales. charity shops and online exchange sites. As waste policy is based on tonnage diverted from disposal (or landfill). policy interventions to promote reuse exchange will be based on the weight of goods estimated to be flowing through these sites. This paper uses a combination of field survey data and scale-up estimation to quantify and characterise the weight of goods exchanged at car boot sales in England in 2012. This is estimated at 50–60 000 tonnes per annum. The paper emphasises that movement up the waste hierarchy brings waste policy into closer contact with household consumption practices.

In this article. the development of a therapeutic work ethic (1813—1979) is presented. drawing particular attention to the changing character and quality of beliefs about therapeutic work throughout time. From hospital factories to radical ‘antipsychiatric’ communities. the article reveals the myriad forms of activities that have variously been considered fit work for people with mental health problems. While popular stereotypes of basket-weaving paint a hapless portrait of institutional work. a more nuanced reading of therapeutic work and its political and philosophical commitments is advanced.

Given the now sizeable body of literature which seeks to problematize traditional conceptual boundaries of work. the article asks to what extent these hidden and unusual work-forms might also be considered legitimate members of the category. Rather than argue for the expansion of the construct to accommodate these activities. the paper attempts simply to problematize the extent to which so-called ‘mad’ forms of work are irresolvably different to more conventional forms of occupation. In challenging notions of the psychiatric patient as inevitably inactive. new vocabularies for service-user work are explored.

1316154,‘Working Through’: An Inquiry into Work and Madness,2012,Jennifer Laws,,,,,,This interdisciplinary doctoral thesis represents the weaving together of several partially independent strands of research conducted by the author between 2008 and 2011 in the field of madness. work and recovery.  The purpose of the thesis is. to borrow from Freud. to ‘work through’ some of the rich and diverse links between work and mental health as they appear throughout time and space. and in particular in a climate where getting people with mental health problems back to work is a central political priority.  The first stream of the thesis is dedicated largely to an historical and philosophical analysis of the relation between work and madness. and especially the therapeutics of work.  Next. voices from contemporary mental health service-users—drawn both from ethnographic work in spaces of ‘sheltered’ employment and narrative research with individuals in mainstream paid employment—are introduced to offer a series of disruptions to common understandings of what it means to be mad at work.  Finally. the thesis turns to policy and to an examination of the ‘what works’ agenda in getting people with mental health difficulties back into paid employment.  Rather than add further to this evidence base. the thesis seeks instead to describe what may be lost when ‘what works’ becomes the only way of thinking about recovery.  Recurring themes in the thesis include the tensions between therapeutic work and damaging work; between curing madness and embracing it; between the complex relations between work. employment and activity and their role in recovery; and between the competing epistemological positions of service-user centred …,True,uv8ablEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,7,http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/3557/1/JLaws_Doctoral_Thesis_Final_Version_May2012.pdf,1439490656997918224,/scholar?cites=1439490656997918224,,,http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/3557/1/JLaws_Doctoral_Thesis_Final_Version_May2012.pdf,0,0,0

Today. policy makers seek reductions in energy use and carbon emissions to mitigate climate change through demand management policies that attempt to reduce usage or shift it in time away from peak demand.

This happened in England in early 1953 when 307 people died in the East Coast Flood.  In Britain today such events. now called storm surges. are forecast daily using computer models from the National Oceanographic Centre in Liverpool. formerly the Liverpool Tidal Institute (TI).  In 1919. when TI was established. such events where considered unpredictable.  TI's researchers. Joseph Proudman (1888-1975). Arthur Doodson (1890-1968). Robert Henry Corkan (1906-1952) and Jack Rossiter (1919-1972). did much mathematical work to attempt to change this.  In 1959 Rossiter published a set of statistical formulae to forecast storm surges on the East Coast and a national warning system was predicting such events using these formulae.  At this point TI believed that they had made surges at least as predictable as they could with their existing methods.  This thesis provides a narrative of how this perceived rise in the predictability of surges happened. analysing how TI worked to achieve it between 1919 and 1959 by following two interwoven. contingent and contested threads: practices of calculation and patronage. A key aspect of this thesis is the attention I pay to material practices of calculation: the methods. technologies and management practices TI's researchers used in their mathematical work on storm surge forecasting.  This is the first study by historians of oceanography or meteorology that pays this detailed level of attention to such practices in the construction of forecasting formulae.

1316170,How did the Electrical Development Association attempt to mould domestic electricity demand in Britain. 1945-1964?,2013,Anna Carlsson-Hyslop and Peter JG Pearson,,,2013/1,,University of Bath,Demand management in Britain is not new. We suggest that there is value in exploring earlier experiences. for the insights they offer into the culture and practices of the electricity supply industry and into the challenges demand management faces today. The paper focuses on the two decades after the Second World War. in which the UK electricity supply industry tried to mould and shift the time profile of electricity demand. especially for domestic heating. Between 1945 and 1964 the Electrical Development Association (EDA) was an industry actor that worked to impact domestic electricity demand. As the industry’s central public relations arm. its main role was to promote electricity and its use. although in this period it also attempted to reduce domestic demand at peaks. especially for space heating. In the late 1940s. when electricity supply was very tight. it did this by advertising to discourage the use of electric fires. Later. the EDA encouraged the take-up of off-peak appliances. such as night-storage heaters. and considered these promotional activities successful attempts at load-shifting. The EDA is thus an interesting case of demand management by an organisation whose main interest was to increase. not decrease. the use of electricity. a position not unlike that of most large electricity utilities today. The paper explores EDA’s stated reasons for engaging with demand management and the context of their work in this area. including shifting government policies and social changes and competition from other fuels and technologies. in an attempt to understand the viewpoint and actions of one of the industry’s influential but traditional actors.

A model of factors that influence the decision to buy flood-protection devices is tested using survey data from 2109 home owners. The results show that the majority of respondents have not purchased domestic flood protection (N = 1732; 82.1%). Purchase of flood-protection devices was influenced by age; perceived seriousness; and beliefs about. and trust in. the role of regulators in managing flooding. In younger respondents the perceived seriousness of the dangers of flooding acted as precursors and barriers to action depending on individual sense of responsibility and agency.

Research on public acceptability has emphasized the importance of intrapersonal factors but has largely neglected the influence of interpersonal factors. In an online survey (N = 948) with a representative sample of the United Kingdom. we therefore integrate interpersonal factors (i.e.. social influence as measured by social networks) with two risky energy technologies that differ in familiarity (nuclear power vs. shale gas) to examine how these factors explain risk and benefit perceptions and public acceptability.

Travel mode options varied according to distance (short: bike. car. public transport; long: car. public transport. multi-modal option consisting of public transport and car-sharing). In addition. each participant received a list of follow-up questions to indicate the reasons and importance for choosing the mode of transport. To analyze the reasons for mode choices and the influence of the treatments we applied regressions models (multinomial models). controlling for socio-economic factors as well as the availability of bikes. cars and public transport passes.Descriptive results show that for the short distance respondents slightly prefer car (39%) over bikes (36%) and public transport options (25%). For the long distance respondents show a strong preference for public transport (52%) and car (46%) whereas only a few respondents (2%) would choose the multi-modal option. According to our experiment the main reason for mode choice is the current ownership of a car or public transport pass. That is. if someone already owns a car. this person will most likely also choose the car. This factor could not be out-weight by the tested treatments. This finding is in line with the analysis of the follow-up questions where respondents claimed that “enjoyment” and “habit” are important factors whereas “price” or “peer effects” do not play a role for mode choice in leisure travel.

There is also agreement that efficiency measures alone won’t be sufficient to reach the reduction targets. There is. however. much less agreement on what should complement efficiency and on how the change of energy consumption can be accomplished. Out of the three similar and often used interchangeably concepts discussed in the literature – behaviour change. curtailment and sufficiency – the authors argue for the latter. They develop an understanding of sufficiency along the core idea of changes in individual preferences for quality of life. Against the backdrop of such an understanding. they elaborate on different tasks for governance for sufficiency and illustrate this along a specific example. As a result. this conceptual chapter provides a diversified. multi-levelled picture for the analysis as well as for the design of governance for sufficiency.,True,oHxoxekAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://edoc.unibas.ch/71551/,,,,,,0,0,0

To overcome mounting threats to the environment. public health and the economy. society needs to steer towards a more sustainable development path (IPCC WG3. 2014). including a better balance between economic. social and environmental goals now and in the future (World Commission on Environment and Development. 1987). It is well documented that in order to reach a more sustainable society. it is necessary to change individual consumption patterns among affluent consumers (IPCC WG3. 2014; UNEP. 2012b). Therefore. there is an increasing focus in national and international politics on how to promote consumer behaviour that is more sustainable in the longer run. Psychology research. examining the underlying motivations of human behaviour (including consumption behaviour). is useful in this connection. Unravelling human motivations enables us to develop interventions aiming to change individual consumer behaviour (Thøgersen. 2014a).Standard consumer behaviour textbooks define consumer behaviour as those activities people undertake when obtaining. using and disposing of products and services (eg Blackwell. Miniard & Engel. 2001). Understanding “green” or “sustainable” consumer behaviour has gained increasing attention in consumer research over the last four decades (Steg.

The electrochemical treatment is an alternative method that efficiently removes (Cr(VI)) from industrial wastewaters. However. in electrochemical plug flow reactors with no liquid mixing or static electrodes. an iron salt film is formed on the surface of the electrodes (electrode passivation). which reduces diffusion and mass transfer that deteriorate the Cr (VI) removal efficiency and increases energy consumption. Therefore. the electrochemical reactors need to be designed to provide high mass transfer from the electrodes to the bulk liquid.

However. the physical mechanism of this phenomenon is not yet fully understood. Experiments in a channel flow for single phase (water) and two phase (water and microbubbles) flows with various void fraction values are studied for a Reynolds number of 5128 based on the half height of the channel and bulk velocity. The state-of-the art Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) measurement technique is used to measure the instantaneous full-field velocity components. Comparisons between turbulent statistical quantities with various values of local void fraction are presented to elucidate the influence of the microbubbles presence within the boundary layer. A decrease in the Reynolds stress distribution and turbulence production is obtained with the increase of microbubble concentration.

It was found out that the flow velocity field and turbulence intensity are not homogeneous inside the reactor. Moreover. the increase in the electrodes rotational speed has no important effect in the turbulence intensity and velocity field inside the ring electrodes zone. which helps explaining why the reaction time is not decreased in the same proportion of angular speed increment.

Apply renewable energy sources. in particular. solar energy is very perspective for it. Meanwhile. with allowance for the constructive properties of using solar heat and electric systems. it is urgent to simplify their integration and the use of these systems as elements of roofs and building facades. Good prospects are opened by using heat pipes as autonomic elements of solar collectors. Given article considers new approach to the design of photovoltaic-thermal collectors on the basis of aluminum heat pipes for use in building facades. In this case. aluminum heat pipes perform a complex role: they simultaneously serve as an absorbing surface. as highly thermal conductive device and as a cooling system for photovoltaic cells. The possibility to use such collectors is confirmed by experimental data which showed that the efficiency of photovoltaic-thermal collector with parameter X=(0.02... 0.06) K· m2/W is 0.35... 0.60. Besides. the photovoltaic-thermal collector can further produce electricity up to 135 W/m2 and maximum heat output up to 457 W/m2 at the incident solar radiation of 900 W/m2. Experimental test was carrying out on the mock-up of facade photovoltaic-thermal collector with dimension 1.340× 500 mm.

Two major customer surveys concentrating on households’ requirements concerning the electricity bill have been carried out in spring 2002. The interest in energy management lies within the fact that the electricity bill can be used as a feedback instrument to influence energy behaviour and the consumer’s awareness of energy usage. What kind of information do households really want on their bills? What do users think of the information they get on the bill today? How frequently do they want the bill to come?

The electricity bills are not coming frequently enough to enable the households to relate their usage of electricity to habits and behaviour in everyday life.

DH bottlenecks are in this study defined as pipes with too high flow relative to the pipe diameter. resulting in difficulties to maintain sufficient differential pressure in the area beyond the pipe. The aim of this study is to investigate how well possible measures to solve bottleneck problems work in different DH network configurations and how much they cost. This was achieved by a simulation study and a cost analysis. The results showed that DH systems with a lower flow rate demanded more extensive measures than other systems and that different problems might arise in different types of networks.

This may result in insufficient differential pressure in DH areas attached to these pipes. Bottlenecks are especially common in expanding DH networks. as previously sufficient pipe diameters may become too small when more DH consumers are connected to the DH network. Historically. bottlenecks have often been addressed by increasing the supply temperature or by exchanging the pipe to a larger dimension. Other techniques are however available to solve bottleneck problems. Such techniques are for example installation of local heat supply on the other side of the bottleneck (LHS). demand side management (DSM). or installation of thermal energy storage (TES).

The keywords in the new price models are higher shares of fixed cost. seasonal energy prices and charging for capacity. Also components that are meant to serve as incentives to affect behaviour are introduced. for example peak load components and flow components. In this study customer responses to these more complex price models have been investigated through focus group interviews and through interviews with companies that have changed their price models.

Build,,1-12,,Load demand in residential houses is a significant contributor to peak load problems experienced by utilities. The knowledge about demand variation in households is fairly limited as well as the use of various tools to analyze the demand. Many utilities have recently installed interval (hourly) metering at their residential customers. The availability of hourly data is a significant progress. however. the utilities use this data only to a limited extent. mostly for billing purposes only. This study aims to discuss the possibilities and the benefits of using this valuable data.There are several established load analysis tools. such as load curve. typical load curve. load duration curve. load factor. superposition factor. etc.. which utilities could apply and develop to provide feedback to small electricity users. Among other benefits. the hourly load data analysis can provide the detailed characteristics of load demand. define the consumption patterns and can help to identify which households contribute most to the utility peaks. This information is essential when developing new energy services. appropriate pricing. load management strategies and demand response programs. Through the analysis of strengths and weaknesses of different load analysis tools. this paper defines the knowledge they could give. how applicable they are and what value they could have both for the utility and the residential customer.

1316261,Energy Services in Sweden-Customer Relations towards Increased Sustainability,2008,Kerstin Sernhed,,,,,,Energy use and supply are evident issues to consider for a sustainable development. where the economic. social and environmental aspects are all important. In large grid-bound systems. the supply of energy is usually a rather invisible activity and the contacts between household custo-mers and utilities are sometimes only repre-sented through the energy bill. In this thesis. three particular fields are emphasized where these interactions comes into focus: Electricity peak load problems and load manage-ment in households; Energy monitoring and feedback. and; The selling of district heating to households in de-tached house areas. Improved customer relations in these areas can both increase the energy utilities abilities to compete on the markets and to contri-bute to an increased sustainable development within the energy sector. The traditional ways to handle peak load problems in the Swedish electricity system have been to build new power plants and to reinforce the elec-tricity grid. However.there are many reasons why solutions should be sought for on the demand-side. This thesis discusses the issues of load management through technical load control of households’ electric heating systems and electric water heaters. and through indirect load management with different pricing of electricity.The new Swedish law about monthly accurate billing of electricity for household customers has influenced the electricity network owners to install new automatic meter reading (AMR) systems. Hourly metering can give raise to a new set of data about household electricity use. that can be utilised to provide detailed characteristics of load demand and …,True,OGJUa6UAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,8,https://lup.lub.lu.se/record/1150910,1960074567373243022,/scholar?cites=1960074567373243022,,,,0,0,0

Department of Energy Sciences. Lund University. The main objective of this study was to investigate how specific households within one housing area (Sandsbro in Växjö with 110 one-family houses) experienced the conversion process. in order to understand the reasons behind “yes” or “no” responses to the utility’s offer. A qualitative approach with semi-structured in-depth interviews with a specially selected sample of households from 10 converted and 13 not converted houses was chosen as the main method. The investigation led to the following conclusions and recommendations:• Household reactions to the terms of sale and conversion: Many households felt that the decisions were rushed-there is a need for better planning. especially for the older households. The information provided was evaluated as detailed and sufficient. The “demonstration villa” was a good idea but the installation should be done more professionally-aesthetics are very important here. Home visits were the only personal contact and should be conducted in all houses in order to answer questions and explain problems. Co-ordination of excavation should be better in order to limit the time the ground is open. A few of the households undertook some of the works themselves to reduce costs but the compensation was often considered as too low to motivate customers.• Household opinions on the product and/or service: Almost all households felt that the thermal comfort was better than …,True,OGJUa6UAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,7,https://lup.lub.lu.se/record/576568,71727228574907170,/scholar?cites=71727228574907170,,,,0,0,0

Fallstudier.,2004,Kerstin Sernhed,,,,,,Electricity must be produced at the same time as it is used. This necessitates flexibility in the electricity production and electricity networks. Until recently. the increase in electricity demand and peak power demand has been met by expansion of the electricity production. Today. due to the deregulation of the electricity market. the production capacity is decreasing. Therefore. there is a national interest in finding solutions to peak problems also on the demand side. ie enabling electricity users to decrease or shift load when needed. For local players in the electricity market. there are various technical and economic motives for developing methods to influence or control customers’ usage patterns. In the studies described here (Study 1 and Study 2) ten households in electrically heated houses. were examined. The households were all customers of the electric utility Skånska Energi AB. In 1999 the utility equipped their customers with a remote metering system (CustCom) that has an in-built load control component. A large number of studies. in Sweden as well as in other countries. investigate the impact of habits on energy use within a home. A hitherto not investigated area is the effect of habits on the load pattern. In Study 1 (of this licentiate thesis). the load pattern of ten households was examined by using energy diaries combined with frequent meter readings (every five minutes) of the load demand for heating. hot water service and domestic electricity use.

Dessa studier har framförallt tryckt på att fjärrvärmens prismodeller bör återspegla fjärrvärmebolagets kostnader för produktion och distribution av fjärrvärme i kundledet då detta minskar fjärrvärmebolagens ekonomiska risker vid förändringar i fjärrvärmeunderlaget eller i kundernas uttagsmönster.  Denna studie har haft som syfte att bredda bilden och synen på vad man bör beakta vid framtagande av prismodeller för fjärrvärme genom att lägga till ett tydligt kundperspektiv. Syftet har varit att analysera kunders syn på fjärrvärmebolagens prismodeller och de förändringar som skett avseende dessa modeller. Ett kvalitativt angreppssätt har valts i denna studie. Anledningen till detta är frågeställningens karaktär. Det är inte alla fjärrvärmekunder som är insatta i hur prismodellen som de debiteras är utformad och fungerar. Vi såg därför ett behov av att kunna diskutera och ställa följdfrågor till kunderna. För att nå en fördjupad dynamik i diskussionerna valdes fokusgruppintervjuer som metod.

Household load patterns and peak load problems,2006,Kerstin Sernhed,6,International Energy Efficiency in Domestic Appliances & Lighting Conference‐EEDAL,,21-23,,Most energy behaviour studies on households focus on the questions how and why we use energy and what can be done to lower energy consumption. Very few studies raise the question of when energy is used or examine the underlying explanations to load patterns. Due to economic and technical problems with electricity peak load. it is important to gain knowledge about how the load patterns of households contribute to power peaks. and to what extent households would accept a shifting of the load at certain critical periods.This paper emphasizes these questions through a case study of ten households with electric space heating in southern Sweden. In these ten households. electricity use for heating. domestic hot water and appliances were measured as three partial loads with five minutes resolution. Energy diaries were kept by the household members. The combination of these two sets of data made it possible to see what appliances were used and what activities were carried out during peaks. The highest power peaks in the households were based on electricity use for appliances. such as saunas. washing machines. dishwashers. and ovens. Coincidental use of large appliances. for example sauna and shower. gave the very highest peaks. Interviews indicated that there was acceptance among the households concerning a shift in the use of certain appliances at certain periods.

Fjärrvärmesverige har nästan uppnått sin vision om en fossilfri värmetillförsel. Detta är en fantastisk prestation som behöver ersättas av nya framtida miljö-. klimat- och samhällsmål att sträva efter. Framtida forskning kring fjärrvärme bör utgå från en tydligare vision och målbild för fjärrvärmen som får bred acceptans och kan utvecklas. Detta skulle i sin tur leda till att långsiktiga förutsättningar identifieras. utvecklas och implementeras. Fjärrvärmen står år 2017 inför utmaningen att den framtida värmemarknaden kommer att vara relativt mättad. Energieffektiviseringar i kombination med ett varmare klimat gör att värmeunderlaget är vikande. Fjärrvärmeföretag behöver se över teknik. affärsmodeller och kundrelationer. De behöver effektivisera den befintliga verksamheten. möta kunders behov av värme och varmvatten på ett nytt och konkurrenskraftigt sätt samtidigt som kundens roll behöver utökas på så sätt att kunden får en mer aktiv roll som partner och inte bara som kund.

Measurements of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) oil film thickness have been carried out to assess the lubricating performance of PFPE with average molecular weight of 9200 using an optical interferometric technique under mean Hertzian pressure 0.45 GPa. The film thickness of 815Z became less than predicted film thickness from Hamrock and Dowson formula for EHL central film thickness.

1316308,Thermodynamic and heat transfer analysis of a Liquid Piston Gas Compressor (LPGC),2018,Mansoureh Khaljani and Adrian Murphy and Yasser Mahmoudi and John Harrison and David Surplus,,,,,,A Liquid Piston Gas Compressor (LPGC) is a new concept to be deployed in Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) systems in order to tackle the challenge of unsteady energy supply by renewable energies such as wind and solar. The LPGC stores the energy as compressed air in the storage tank when renewable energies are available and reuses it when they are not available. This work aims to understand the thermodynamic and heat transfer characteristics of a LPGC system in the comression process. In addition. as LPGC are more efficient while working isothermally. further investigation is undertaken on the use of porous materials in the LPGC to increase the rate of heat transfer from the compressed gas to the porous medium in the compression phase. The porous medium is considered to be a row of narrow parallel plates attached to the top section of the LPGC. The results reveal that the peak air temperature reduces with the introduction of both the five plate (by 16 K) and the nine plate (by 21 K) configurations. Introducing more plates increases the heat transfer between the high-temperature air and the plates and thus increases the plate temperatures. Additionally. by inserting plates. the compression process becomes an isothermal process. Finally. the compression efficiency is used to compare the performance of case studies. The result reveals that there are an optimum number of plates to have the optimum compression efficiency.,True,ki6QjZUAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC,0,https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/158723335/Thermodynamic_and_heat_transfer_analysis_of_a_high_pressure_15_09_2018.pdf,,,,,https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/158723335/Thermodynamic_and_heat_transfer_analysis_of_a_high_pressure_15_09_2018.pdf,0,0,0

In this context. the problem is that the more processors the job requires the more difficult it is to find an idle slot to run it on. As a consequence the resources are often inefficiently used as some of them remain unallocated in the final schedule. To address this issue we propose a technique called job folding that uses virtualization to reduce the number of processors allocated to a parallel job and thus allows to execute it earlier. Our goal is to optimize the resource use.

This result holds true even when setup times occur in the execution and homogeneous buffers are available for the storage of intermediate results. In this kind of application. several computation stages are interconnected as a linear application graph. and each stage holds a buffer of limited size where intermediate results are stored and a processor setup time occurs when passing from one stage to another. In this paper. we tackle the problem in which the buffer sizes are not given beforehand and must be fixed before the execution to maximize the throughput within each processor. The goal of this work is to minimize the cost induced by the setup times by allocating buffers that are proportinal in size to each other.

Cham,Nowadays. users are permanently prompted to create web accounts when they buy online goods. This collected data gives an insight on the user. sometimes beyond the application scope. Inference attacks on databases represent an issue for data controllers when malicious processors attempt to guess sensitive data - to which they haven’t access - by inferring them using legally accessed data. Several inference attack detection systems address this problem in case of a single targeted database. But the issue remains unsolved in case of several databases to which the same users might have submitted their data.

1316366,Performance effecting parameters of hybrid nanofluids,2020,Tayyab Raza Shah and Hasan Koten and Hafiz Muhammad Ali,,,,179-213,Academic Press,Idiosyncratic thermophysical and optical features are the factors compelling research community to conduct extensive research work on hybrid nanofluids. Hybrid nanofluids possess far better thermal and optical characteristics than the simple nanofluids owing to synergistic effect of different nanoparticles forming hybrid nanofluids. Brief analysis of literature reveals that hybrid nanofluids are greatly influenced by factors like basefluid. temperature. pH value. surfactant. sonication time. clustering. nanoparticle shape. size. and concentration. However. the effect of nanoparticle size and shape is inconclusive thus far. Clustering has been found to be the most adverse phenomena which makes the hybrid nanofluid features time dependent and limits their operational success and practicability.

Due to innovations in industrial and motor technology. electric vehicles can both travel longer and reach higher speed. In recent years. as environmental sensibility has increased. and fossil fuels have been exhausted in the world. electric vehicles have become a serious alternative to gasoline diesel vehicles since they provide solutions for gasoline-diesel vehicles. Due to the decisive stance of states that have advanced industry. electric vehicles will soon become a necessity rather than a good alternative. From the reasons we talked about. electric vehicles have become a matter of serious investment and development. which is at the focal point of various community. The main focal point of the developments in electric vehicles is to go to longer distances with lower energy and store more energy in both light and small batteries. The production stages are also one of the current problems. The lack of hardware in serial production of electric vehicles is being tried to be solved using different technologies.

Biogas fuel is considerably economic due to the local product fuel compared to that of CNG and LPG fuels for many countries. In addition. due to the higher octane rate. biogas is considerably adaptable for the diesel engines. In this issue. CBG diesel-fueled engine was investigated using full geometry 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations including intake and exhaust ports were used in optimization process to get the optimum design parameters of the CBG-diesel engine. Usage of CBG fuel in the optimized CBG engine without any constructive change in cylinder block will considerably decrease the cost. During the engine design. one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) CFD codes and multi-objective optimization code were employed by coupling codes. CBG and diesel fuels were defined as leading reactants using user-defined code in dual-fuel diesel engine modeling. CBG and diesel mass flow rates. start of pilot diesel fuel injection. compression ratio. valve timing. and engine speed were defined as input variables in different engine loads and evaluated about 20.000 cases to define the proper operating conditions. CBG-diesel engine and significantly lower NOx emissions were emitted under dual-fuel operation for all cases compared to single-fuel mode at all engine load conditions. Moreover.

Since the financial sector is considered as one of the sectors that will contribute to Malaysian economy to become a developed country by 2020. we utilize a cointegration method to investigate how financial development affects sectoral CO2 emissions. The long-run results reveal that financial development increases CO2 emissions from﻿ the transportation and oil and gas sector and reduces CO2 emissions from manufacturing and construction sectors.

In an agricultural dependent economy such as Nigeria. the nation depends on the agriculture sector to feed its growing population and to foster economic development. However. in this study. we consider CO2 emission from the agriculture sector to be the indicator for the environmental quality. We posit that like any other developing economy. there is a role play by the financial sector to promote growth and progress in enhancing economic development. The pursuit for economic development will ultimately result in environmental pollution. We employ the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach on annual data spanning from 1971-2011. The control variables included in this study comprises national income. energy consumption. foreign direct investment and population. Our results suggest that all variables exhibit long-run relationship with CO2 emissions from the agricultural sector. Financial development and national income show negative relationship with CO2 emissions from agricultural sector. suggesting that economic development has not taken place at the expense of CO2 emissions.

To achieve this objective. a cointegration analysis was used to verify the long-run relationship among the variables. with a dataset spanning from 1981 to 2011. The estimates of income provide evidence of a negative and important relationship with deforestation in both long- and short-run periods. This suggests that higher income can reduce deforestation and improve environmental quality. Furthermore. the coefficient of the population consistently provides evidence of a positive and important relationship with deforestation in the long- and short-run periods. Therefore. the population has been identified as the major cause of deforestation and environmental degradation in the model.

1316386,A heuristic approach to measure contribution of foreign trade to growth,2018,Azman Hassan and M Yusof Saari and Nur Adilah Hamid and Chakrin Utit and Ibrahim Kabiru Maji,55,Malaysian Journal of Economic Studies,1,115-131,,Contribution of final demand components to gross domestic product (GDP) is often measured by a simple aggregated national accounting identity. Under this conventional approach. the contribution of exports is subtracted from imports to compute the contribution of net exports but it fails to split the imported intermediate and final use that is embodied in each domestic final demand. The so-called import-adjusted approach is considered to be an ideal approach to measure the contribution of each final demand component to GDP. This approach splits imported intermediate and final use for each final demand component instead of accumulating all of them in the export component. This paper provides a heuristic approach for the application of import-adjusted approach to time-series data. We show that given a benchmark input-output table and provided with the annual trade statistics. the bias in measuring the contribution of domestic demand and foreign trade can be reduced. More importantly. we have provided a practical approach that does not only reduce man-hours required for database development but also obtain satisfactory findings.

We used annual time series data for the period 1983–2014 and employed the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) modelling approach to estimate the long-run impact of oil price shocks on sectoral CO2 emissions. We found a negative relationship between oil price shocks and CO2 emissions in all sectors; namely. manufacturing and construction. agriculture. transportation. and the oil and gas sectors. This suggests that higher oil price can mitigate sectoral CO2 emissions while lower oil price can increase sectoral CO2 emissions. Generally. income exerts a positive impact on sectoral CO2 emissions. implying that an increase in the level of income invokes sectoral CO2 emissions.

Malaysia is one of the countries that actively participating in the processing trade activities in the Asian region. While empirical evidences in other countries clearly indicate the unfavorable effects on local economies. empirical works to quantify the impact of increased international outsourcing in Malaysia are clearly lagged behind. The fact is that the conventional national accounts framework does not separate the processing trade activities in the calculation of gross domestic products (GDP). In this paper. we further improve the GDP accounting by separating the manufacturing sectors according to domestic and processing-trade sectors. and integrating them consistently in a so-called ‘dualistic’inputoutput table. Results clearly show that the processing-trade sectors do not only associated with higher foreign content but also have lower growth linkages to the domestic economy.

The current macroeconomic models are unable to provide explicit answer to this question because they ignore dualities in production technologies. The major limitation of the current macroeconomic models is production sectors are aggregative and thus homogeneity biases underlying in the models could not be avoided. In particular. one might get a false impression that development in some sector will “trickle down” equally to benefit all sectors. What is needed is a systematic methodological approach that links the different dualistic production structures. This paper has two objectives. First. it develops a new dataset for macroeconomic models that split the production sectors according to sizes—small. medium and large sectors. Second. using the new dataset. it analyzes the key sector for small and medium sized firms. Results indicate that growth linkages between small and medium. and large sized sectors are weak—with the growth stimuli mostly benefitted the large sized sector.

We develop a finite element method (FEM) for modeling the dynamics of a single rigid fiber suspended in a moving fluid. Our approach seeks solutions using the Newton–Raphson method for the fiber’s linear and angular velocities such that the net hydrodynamic forces and torques acting on the fiber are zero. Fiber motion is then computed with a Runge-Kutta method to update the fiber position and orientation as a function of time. Low-Reynolds-number viscous flows are considered since these best represent the flow conditions for a polymer melt within a mold cavity.

The Golla-Hughes-Mctavish (GHM) method is employed to describe the frequency-dependent characteristics of viscoelastic material (VEM). A model reduction is completed by using iterative dynamic condensation and balance model reduction method to design an effective control system. The emphasis is concerned on hybrid (combined feedback/feedforward) control system to attenuate the vibration of plates with ACLD treatments. The optimal linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is considered as a feedback channel and the adaptive filtered-reference LMS (FxLMS) controller is used as a feedforward channel. They can be utilized individually or in a hybrid way to suppress the vibration of plate/ACLD system. The results show that the hybrid controller which combines feedback/feedforward together can reduce the displacement amplitude of plate/ACLD system subjected to a complicated disturbance substantially without requiring more control effort. Furthermore. the hybrid controller has more rapid and stable convergence rate than the adaptive feedforward FxLMS controller. Meanwhile. perfect robustness to phase error of the cancellation path in feedforward controller and the weight matrices in feedback LQG controller is demonstrated in proposed hybrid controller.

In order to address these issues. we pursue sacrificial polymer-based airgap MEMS packaging as a low-cost. clean.

Inc.,The electroless deposition of copper is often used for interconnect in microelectronics. The electroless copper layer can be used as a seed layer of electroplating. or can be deposited to full metal thickness. The major challenges facing electroless deposition for interconnect include cost. deposition time. reliability. and electrical conductivity. The insulating surface onto which the deposit is made is first catalytically activated prior to electroless copper deposition. The conventional Pd-based catalyst is expensive. due to the high cost of Pd. which poses an economic constraint on the electroless deposition process. Another concern is the reliability of deposit if there is poor adhesion between the deposited electroless copper layer and the insulator. In addition. the electrical performance of copper interconnect is adversely affected by surface roughness which results in surface scattering of electrons. especially at high frequency. At high frequency. the conductivity can be compromised because the conventional swell & etch process is based on an increase in the surface roughness in order to achieve acceptable adhesion through mechanical anchoring of the catalyst and the deposited metal 1-2. Thus. there is a clear need for improved catalysts which can lower the cost (ie nonpalladium catalysts). and avoid adding surface roughness (ie elimination of the swell & etch process). The goal of this study is to improve the electroless copper deposition process on epoxy laminate substrates using a non-palladium catalyst without the use of the swell & etch process. A Sn/Ag catalyst on nonroughened laminate substrates was investigated. It was found that a hot …,True,CIdbReUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.714.9450&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.714.9450&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1316445,Frequency Response of Microcantilevers in Supercritical CO2,2010,Erdal Uzunlar and M Salih Kılıç and B Erdem Alaca and Hakan Ürey and Can Erkey,,,,,,Micromechanical resonators have been extensively studied in recent years because of their potential for high-sensitive. low cost. compact device applications. such as mass sensors [1. 2]. force sensors [3]. viscometers and densitometers [4-12]. chemical [2. 13. 14] and biological [1] sensors. explosive detectors [2]. devices for mechanical characterization (eg for determining Young’s modulus)[15] and for studying microscale phenomena (eg Knudsen effect)[16]. The dynamics of microcantilevers (MCs) in fluids are important in the atomic force microscopy in biological buffers [5]. naval architectural design [17] and the design of aforementioned viscometers and densitometers. In the operation of MCs in a fluid. viscosity and density of the fluid are crucial parameters since the hydrodynamic length scale of the MCs are comparable to the viscous penetration depth in the fluid [18].The behavior of the MCs immersed in fluids is mostly investigated by the changes in the resonance spectra. ie the shifts in the resonance frequency. fR. and the quality factor. Q. fR corresponds to the frequency at which the maximum amplitude of oscillation is achieved and the Q is the measure of sharpness of the resonance peak formulated as Q= fR/2g. in which the frequencies fR+ g and fR-g above and below fR at which the amplitude is equal to Amax/2 1/2. where Amax is the maximum amplitude of oscillation achieved at fR [10].

1316487,Sustainability of off-grid photovoltaic systems for rural electrification in developing countries: A review,2016,Sarah Feron,8,,12,1326,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,A review on rural electrification programs and projects based on off-grid Photovoltaic (PV) systems. including Solar Pico Systems (SPS) and Solar Home Systems (SHS) in Developing Countries (DCs) was conducted. The goal was to highlight the main multidimensional drawbacks that may constrain the sustainability of these systems. Four dimensions of sustainability (institutional. economic. environmental and socio-cultural) were considered in this review. It was found that institutional flaws (such as the scarcity of durability/stability and enforcement of formal institutions. weak regulations or standards. incomplete decentralization/participation and the lack of institutional adaptability) seriously compromise the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in DCs. While the lack of an effective focalized subsidy scheme (eg. cross-tariff scheme) for the electricity tariffs of the poor population often made projects economically unsustainable. the scarcity of environmental awareness. regulations or incentives has often turned presumably clean energy technologies into environmentally unsustainable projects. Progress regarding social acceptance. accuracy and cultural justice is urgently needed for ensuring the socio-cultural sustainability of rural electrification efforts in DCs. This review may help stakeholders to identify and (based on prior experiences) address the most severe drawbacks affecting the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in DCs.

In this paper. we report on measurements of the soiling effect on the energy yield of grid-connected crystalline silicon PV modules deployed in five cities across a north-south transect of approximately 1300 km in the Atacama Desert ranging from latitude 18 S to latitude 30 S. Energy losses were assessed by comparing side-by-side outputs of four co-planar PV modules.

1316489,Sustainability of rural electrification programs based on off-grid photovoltaic (PV) systems in Chile,2016,Sarah Feron and Harald Heinrichs and Raul R Cordero,6,"Energy, Sustainability and Society",1,1-19,BioMed Central,Mainly based on expanding the grid. Chile has reached an impressive electrification rate. However. due to unviable grid expansion to islands and remote areas of the country. the government started implementing off-grid electrification programs. In this paper. we assess the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Chile paying special attention to off-grid photovoltaic (PV) programs. Our assessment of the rural electrification efforts in Chile takes into account four dimensions of sustainability (institutional. economic. environmental. and socio-cultural). It is based on an extensive qualitative document analysis. complemented by semi-structured interviews to key stakeholders. We found that. despite several successful pilot off-grid PV projects. the deployment of off-grid PV solutions for rural electrification lagged behind the enormous solar potential of the country. Part of the problem is that decisions favoring other technologies have been made without considering costs over the lifetime and environmental co-impacts. Moreover. the social acceptance of off-grid PV solutions has been seriously compromised due to problems regarding the accuracy (systems were unable to meet the user’s needs) and reliability (systems often failed due to lack of mandatory standards and the uncertain maintenance). Although Chile has conducted remarkable efforts on electrification during the last 20 years. the indigenous communities still have less access to electricity. This disparity is a major drawback that underscores the need for adjusting the electrification approach (which means that the communities or the local authorities have to request electrification at first place …,True,2YUGWaEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,26,https://energsustainsoc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13705-016-0098-4,4019802945887417116,/scholar?cites=4019802945887417116,,,https://energsustainsoc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13705-016-0098-4,0,0,0

This area is characterized by its high altitude. prevalent cloudless conditions. and a relatively low total ozone column. In this paper. we provide estimates of the surface UV (monthly UV index at noon and annual doses of UV-B and UV-A) for all sky conditions in the Atacama Desert. We found that the UV index at noon during the austral summer is expected to be greater than 11 in the whole desert. The annual UV-B (UV-A) doses were found to range from about 3.5 kWh/m2 (130 kWh/m2) in coastal areas to 5 kWh/m2 (160 kWh/m2) on the Andean plateau.

Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional. economic. environmental. and socio-cultural) and is based on an exhaustive qualitative document analysis. complemented by semi-structured expert interviews. We found that disruptive changes have affected the electrification policies in Ecuador during decades of avoiding the development of strengthened institutions. Despite this major drawback. we found that there is a consensus on granting access to energy for all. This partially explains the national efforts. persistent through different administrations to fund rural electrification. However. in the case of off-grid photovoltaic solutions. these efforts have consistently neglected allocating funds for operation and maintenance. which has seriously compromised the sustainability. Moreover. although Ecuadorian officials declared to favor stand-alone photovoltaic systems in the case of indigenous communities in the Amazon. we found that environmental or socio-cultural aspects have a minor role in the selection of these systems. Progress regarding environmental awareness. social acceptance. and cultural justice. is still needed for ensuring the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

Ecuador. and Peru. Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional. economic. environmental. and socio-cultural). We found that Ecuador and Chile have consistently failed to ensure mechanisms for the operation and maintenance of the deployed off-grid systems. which has made these solutions in poor Chilean and Ecuadorian communities inevitably unsustainable. Although Peru has adopted a cross-tariff scheme. the Peruvian case shows that ensuring the funding of off-grid PV solutions is not enough. Peruvian officials appear to be unaware of the importance of local participation (local values and lifestyles are constantly disregarded) and most of the projects have been designed without the participation and engagement of the communities. which has often led to project failures and payment defaults. However. although each country has its particular challenges. we found that the three Andean countries have consistently neglected the importance of strong formal institutions with a flexible and decentralized structure. which in turn significantly compromised the rural electrification effort in these countries.

1316494,Is Peru prepared for large-scale sustainable rural electrification?,2018,Sarah Feron and Raúl R Cordero,10,Sustainability,5,1683,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Peru has historically been among the Latin-American countries with a low rural electrification rate. Aiming to improve this situation. the country conducted several electrification efforts in the last few decades that included off-grid photovoltaic (PV) solutions for remote areas (where the grid expansion was unviable). More recently. the government has also sponsored a ‘massive program’that aims to deploy a minimum of 150.000 off-grid PV solutions in the upcoming years. In this paper. we assess the sustainability of rural electrification programs in Peru. paying special attention to the ongoing “massive program”. Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional. economic. environmental. and socio-cultural) and is based on an exhaustive qualitative document analysis complemented by semi-structured expert interviews. We found that the lack of strong formal institutions with a flexible and decentralized structure seriously compromises the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Peru. Staff rotation and overlapping competences have caused disturbing changes and inhibited following a strategic line. while widespread outsourcing combined with weak controls have often affected the reliability of the deployed systems. Although cross subsidies have made off-grid PV systems affordable for users. systems often fell short of energy demand. Notably. we found that Peruvian officials appear to be unaware of the importance of local participation. and there is a significant mistrust between the government and the rural population (especially in areas where mining is extensive).

We have used Landsat imagery over the period 1986–2018 in order to assess the changes in the snow cover extent across a north-south transect of approximately 2.500 km (18–40 S). Despite the significant interannual variability. here we show that the dry-season snow cover extent declined across the entire study area at an average rate of about− 12% per decade. We also show that this decreasing trend is mainly driven by changes in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). especially at latitudes lower than 34 S. At higher latitudes (34–40 S). where the El Niño signal is weaker. snow cover losses appear to be also influenced by the poleward migration of the westerly winds associated with the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM).,True,2YUGWaEAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,6,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53486-7,384090620563999941,/scholar?cites=384090620563999941,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53486-7,0,0,0

The observations showed that this correlation was enhanced during the last several decades. when a simultaneously increased coupling between ozone and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) anomalies became broader. covering most of the following summer and part of the previous winter. For eastern Australia. the ozone–precipitation connection shows a greater persistence toward the following summer than for other regions. On the other hand. for South America. the ozone–precipitation correlation seems more robust. especially in the early summer. There. the correlation also covers part of the previous winter. suggesting that winter planetary waves could affect both parameters. Further. we estimated the sensitivity of precipitation to changes in Antarctic ozone. In both observations and simulations. we found comparable sensitivity values during the spring–summer period. Overall. our results indicate that ozone anomalies can be understood as a tracer of stratospheric circulation. However. simulations indicate that stratospheric ozone chemistry still contributes to strengthening the interannual relationship between ozone and surface climate.

Changes in the frequency of relatively warm days (including heatwaves) can substantially alter the SM variability. thus leading to extreme melting events. By using simulations from 13 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and according to a moderate representative concentration pathways (RCP4. 5). here we show that the frequency of extreme SM events (SM90; according to the 90th percentile over the reference period 1961-1990) may significantly increase in coastal areas of West Antarctica; in particular in the Antarctic Peninsula. By the end of the century SM90 estimates are expected to increase from currently 0.10 kg/m2/day to about 0.45 kg/m2/day in the Antarctic Peninsula.

Reductions in the albedo (triggered by a change in air temperature or by the LAI deposition) can also enhance feedback mechanisms; as the albedo drops. the fraction of absorbed solar energy increases. which leads to additional albedo drops. Here we assess the presence of Black Carbon (BC) and LAI in coastal snowpacks in the Antarctic Peninsula. The BC-equivalent contentwas assessed by applying the meltwater filtration (MF) technique to snow samples taken at 7 locations in theAntarctic Peninsula. from latitude 62oS to latitude 67oS.

1316509,Sustainability of off-grid photovoltaic systems for rural electrification: empirical evidence from selected Andean countries,2018,Sarah Féron,,,,,,Universal access to affordable. reliable and modern energy is a fundamental component for Sustainable Development. Yet. 1.2 billion people are still lacking access to electricity. especially in rural areas of Developing Countries. Tackling Climate Change under a scenario of increasing energy demand requires technologies with a low environment impact that facilitate economic development and that are socially supported. Renewable Energy solutions based on off-grid photovoltaic (PV) systems could meet these criteria in rural and remote areas where the grid extension is not practicable.Against this background. this thesis aims to assess the sustainability of rural electrification efforts based on off-grid PV systems in three Andean countries: Chile. Ecuador. and Peru. Although deployment of this solution for rural electrification began in the early 1990s in the Andean region. most of the projects turned out to be unsustainable and did not last. Prior efforts have addressed the different issues and barriers that plagued these projects and inhibited their sustainability.

The goal was to highlight the main multidimensional drawbacks that may constrain the sustainability of these systems. Four dimensions of sustainability (institutional. economic. environmental and socio-cultural) were considered in this review. It was found that institutional flaws (such as the scarcity of durability/stability and enforcement of formal institutions. weak regulations or standards. incomplete decentralization/participation and the lack of institutional adaptability) seriously compromise the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in DCs.

This paper presents the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental observations of gas-liquid two-phase flow pattern characteristic through a vertical to horizontal right angled (90) elbow. Experimental observations were conducted in a transparent test section that consisted of a vertical pipe. elbow bend and horizontal pipe with an inside diameter of 0.036 m. The CFD simulations were performed by using a computer software package. FLUENT 6.2. Bubbly flow conditions were created in the vertical test section with the variation of superficial liquid Reynolds number from 13 497 to 49 488 and volumetric gas quality from 0.05 to 0.2. The CFD results showed a good agreement with experimental results in the following observations. The results showed that gas-liquid flow pattern inside and downstream of the elbow bend mainly depended on liquid velocity and it is also influenced by gas quality at high liquid velocities. At lower liquid velocities. gas-liquid separation began early in the elbow bend and gas-phase migrated to outer bend. Then. it smoothly transformed to stratified flow at elbow outlet. When the liquid velocity was further increased. the liquid phase occupied the outer bend rubbing the gas phase to the inner bend and delayed the formation of gas layer in the horizontal pipe. The increase of gas quality in higher liquid velocities promoted gas core formation at the elbow exit and caused wavy gas layers at the downstream of the elbow.,True,64RT4ZcAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C,11,http://ajstd.org/index.php/ajstd/article/view/344,969101863563318876,/scholar?cites=969101863563318876,,,https://ajstd.org/index.php/ajstd/article/download/344/339,0,0,0

The main object used is a circular cylinder. and the passive controls used are the Type-I cylinder in the front and an elliptical cylinder at the rear of the main object. The distances between the main object and the passive controls are varied. The Reynolds number used is 1000. The effective distance between the main object and the passive controls is analyzed by using the mathematical model so that the drag coefficient on the main object is compared with the simulated one.

One option to unlock these vicious cycles is demand side management. for example. substituting traditional biomass fuels with modern ones.

1316592,Deliberation in multi-stakeholder participation: A heuristic framework applied to the Committee on World Food security,2018,Matheus Alves Zanella and Ariane Goetz and Stephan Rist and Oscar Schmidt and Jes Weigelt,10,Sustainability,2,428,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Multi-stakeholder participation (MSP) has become a central feature in several institutions and processes of global governance. Those who promote them trust that these arrangements can advance the deliberative quality of international institutions. and thereby improve the democratic quality. legitimacy and effectiveness of both the institutional landscape. as well as decisions made within it. This paper employs a heuristic framework to analyze the deliberative quality of MSP. Specifically. it applies Dryzek’s deliberative systems framework to the case of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS). The assessment shows that the CFS improves the deliberative quality of food security governance by including and facilitating the transmission of discourses from the public to the empowered spaces. However. the deliberative quality of CFS could be higher with stronger accountability mechanisms in place. more meta-deliberation and adoption of CFS outcomes at national and local levels. Reflecting on the limitations of using this heuristic framework to assess MSP. we conclude that the analysis would benefit from more explicit consideration of different forms of power that are part of the social relations between actors involved in such settings. By proposing this analytical approach. we expect to advance a heuristic framework for assessing deliberation in an international context of the growing importance of MSP in sustainability and global governance.

On the one hand. the dramatic rise of intra-state conflicts. particularly on the African continent. reflected an acute security vacuum that many less developed countries were facing due to the end of the Cold War and the ‘sudden’withdrawal of military. political. and financial support by great powers. largely a result of superpower competition by the United States and the Soviet Union. On the other hand. and in response to this debasing security situation in many countries around the world. unprecedented national. regional. and global efforts were undertaken to address these severe imploding security conditions. 1 In fact. the often-weak political. socio-economic. and military capacities and capabilities of states or international organizations2 in dealing with these security concerns yielded a push by national and international actors for adequate institutionalized solutions at the regional or international level. Consequently. a reconfiguration of1 Given the fact that between 1945 and 1986. 125 (out of 127) major conflicts took place in the so-called ‘‘Third World’’(Latin America. Africa. Middle East. and Asia). it would be wrong to label the Cold War era as an era of stability and security. In this context. Acharya (in Fawcett 2000) has pointed out that the ‘‘Third World’’accounted for a majority ‘of the over 20 million war-related deaths during this period’(Acharya in Fawcett 2000: 80). Nevertheless. the end of the Cold War did provide for an increase in the instability and insecurity of many less-developed countries due to the breakdown of …,True,QjZUy0oAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,9,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hany_Besada/publication/291172074_Crafting_an_African_security_architecture_Addressing_regional_peace_and_conflict_in_the_21st_century/links/5bc9f25e458515f7d9ca636b/Crafting-an-African-security-architecture-Addressing-regional-peace-and-conflict-in-the-21st-century.pdf,2288194829182706344,/scholar?cites=2288194829182706344,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hany_Besada/publication/291172074_Crafting_an_African_security_architecture_Addressing_regional_peace_and_conflict_in_the_21st_century/links/5bc9f25e458515f7d9ca636b/Crafting-an-African-security-architecture-Addressing-regional-peace-and-conflict-in-the-21st-century.pdf,0,0,0

1316595,Different regions. different reasons? Comparing Chinese land-consuming outward investments in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,2015,Ariane Goetz,,Conference Paper,37,,,Research indicates that key parameters of “land grabbing” differ across regions (eg. ILC 2012)–particularly in view of who invests and/or when the bulk of investments occurred. At the same time. my review of the “land grab” literature since 2008 reveals that hardly any comparative assessments of “land grabbing” from a home country perspective exist that study whether and/or in which way and why “land grabs” of a single investor country differ across regions. This paper assesses and compares the main empirical characteristics of Chinese land acquisitions in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa since 2000 from a home country perspective. It addresses two questions: Firstly. the paper comparatively assesses the main empirical characteristics of how these investments occur. regarding the sectoral composition. actor constellations. timelines. and the role of land in both regions. On this basis. secondly. it studies whether and in which way China applies different rationales and strategies in these two regions. comparing significant ideologies. foreign policies. political economies. and institutions that have been identified during the assessment to play a role in how and why they take these “land grabs” occur. The data collection and assessment will be done by way of systematic process tracing and a comparative research design focusing on the two target regions from a home country perspective.

Drawing on the best published evidence to date on performance. a set of companion papers1 question many of the assumptions commonly attributed to biofuels: their carbon neutrality. their positive effect on rural livelihoods. and (in cases of under-performance) policymakers’ ability to effectively govern for sustainability. This paper takes these findings as its starting point and asks.“What next?” for countries wishing to advance national biofuel programmes as one of several options for the necessary divestment from fossil fuels. Deriving recommendations for national biofuel programmes based on past performance is no easy task. The wider literature highlights some of the challenges to such an endeavour–namely. that context matters deeply in shaping outcomes. thereby undermining the potential for standardised solutions; that social and natural systems are complex. rendering interventions indeterminate in their effects; and that deriving proscriptions for future action based on evidence of past performance requires leaps of evidence and faith. thus involving moral hazards. And even in cases where biofuels come close to meeting expectations. taking these successes to scale poses additional challenges inherent in the scaling process itself.

Digestate quality and treatment in high solid anaerobic digestion (HSAD) can be better than conventional low-solid system. The rheological behavior of digestate in high solid anaerobic digestion (HSAD) can have a great impact on the energy consumption of digestate management. After post-conditioning guided by rheological parameters. the solid digestate can be further treated based on the integrated solutions to enhance the energy efficiency or nutrients recovery. The environmental impacts for some core parts of those integrated systems were also evaluated in this study.

1316615,Effect of aeration applied during different phases of anaerobic digestion,2018,Francesca Girotto and Wei Peng and Razieh Rafieenia and Raffaello Cossu,9,,2,161-174,Springer Netherlands,Aerobic treatment has been investigated as a method to enhance putrescible substrate degradation and biogas production through anaerobic digestion (AD). A series of aeration methods has been studied in different phases of anaerobic digestion (before. during. or at a late stage of AD). Several research groups have applied aeration together with anaerobic digestion to improve hydrolysis and increase substrate conversion efficiencies. Aeration has been proven to reduce volatile fatty acids (VFA) accumulation during AD. reducing pH inhibition for methanogens. and thus increasing process yields. Aeration may represent an effective method to reduce substrates’ toxicity (e.g. sulphur compounds). particularly when digestate. resulting from their anaerobic digestion. is destined for use on the land.

The by-product from AD. the digestate. still rich in putrescible components and nutrients. is mainly considered for reutilization as a bio-fertilizer or a compost after its treatment. However. the limitations exist for digestate agricultural application because of nutrients surplus. fertilization seasons. high cost of long-distance transportation and low market acceptance. Besides. digestate from OFMSW and food waste needs to be disposed as “waste” when it does not comply with the regulation requirements.  The chapter 1 of the work is an overview on the digestate characterizations. regulations of agricultural use and application techniques. The concept of Back to Earths Alternatives (BEAs) introduced in the literature review involves that the residues. after appropriate treatment. ""should be returned to their non-mobile state as they were before they were extracted from the ground to be used as raw materials "".

Statistical distributions as well as arithmetic and weighted averages of production parameters are derived for different categories of fields specified by size. location and water depth. A significant tendency of small fields having higher depletion and decline rates is found. Similarly. OECD countries generally have higher rates compared to non-OECD countries.

1316633,Characteristic Production Decline Patterns for Shale Gas Wells in Barnett,2017,Keqiang Guo and Baosheng Zhang and Henrik Wachtmeister and Kjell Aleklett and Mikael Höök,5,Int. J. Sustain. Future Hum. Secur,,11-20,,This paper derives characteristic decline patterns for shale gas wells by analyzing historical well production data using decline curve analysis of 14.453 shale gas wells in the Barnett shale play from 2000 to 2014. The Hyperbolic model and the Stretched Exponential model are applied on the well-by-well production data at average aggregate well and individual well levels to derive the characteristic parameters. Both the Hyperbolic curve and the Stretched Exponential curve display a good fit to the data for both the average aggregate and the individual shale gas wells. The Hyperbolic model performs slightly better than the Stretched Exponential model in this study. The first year rate of decline for production of a shale gas well is around 60% and over the first two years is around 73%. There is an increasing trend in initial production for new wells over the last decade. A supposed cut-off production rate of 133 Mcf/d results in the estimated ultimate recoverable resource (URR) of about 1.4-2.7 billion cubic feet and a well life time of 11-29 years. which is in line with other studies.,True,6yLMLH8AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,5,http://www.j-sustain.com/files/pub/file/2017/Vol%205%20No%201/J-SustaiNVol5No1_11-20%20EnE-041-12164.pdf,1503157865581303058,/scholar?cites=1503157865581303058,,,http://www.j-sustain.com/files/pub/file/2017/Vol%205%20No%201/J-SustaiNVol5No1_11-20%20EnE-041-12164.pdf,0,0,0
1316634,Investment and production dynamics of conventional oil and unconventional tight oil: Implications for oil markets and climate strategies,2020,Henrik Wachtmeister and Mikael Höök,1,Energy and Climate Change,,100010,Elsevier,Unconventional tight oil production has increased fast in recent years. This development can appear threatening to climate change mitigation efforts as more available supply might lead to continuing or increasing consumption. contributing to ‘carbon lock-in’. possibly making a low-carbon energy transition more difficult. However. the investment and production cycles of tight oil differ from conventional oil. This study investigates such differences and discusses whether it has any implications for the oil market and for energy and climate strategy in regard to carbon lock-in and stranded assets.Production and capital investment data for conventional oil fields and unconventional tight oil wells are analysed and standard production profiles are derived. Through a bottom-up approach aggregate investment and production dynamics are then investigated.The analysis shows that in conventional production. once initial …,True,6yLMLH8AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666278720300106,7186572641770739739,/scholar?cites=7186572641770739739,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666278720300106,0,0,0

1316636,World oil supply and unconventional resources: Bottom-up perspectives on tight oil production,2018,Henrik Wachtmeister,,,,,,Oil is the world’s largest primary energy source. It dominates the transportation sector which underpins the world economy. Yet. oil is a nonrenewable resource. destined not to last forever. In the mid-2000s global conventional oil production stagnated. leading to rising oil prices and fears of permanent oil scarcity. These fears. together with the high prices. receded with the unforeseen emergence of a new supply source: tight oil. This licentiate thesis investigates unconventional tight oil production and its impacts on world oil supply in terms of resource availability and oil market dynamics. and in turn briefly discusses some possible wider economic. political and environmental implications of these impacts. The thesis is based on three papers. The first investigates the usefulness of bottom-up modelling by a retrospective study of past oil projections. The second looks at how unconventional tight oil production can be modelled on the well level using decline curve analysis. The third derives typical production parameters for conventional offshore oil fields. a growing segment of conventional production and a useful comparison to tight oil. The results show that tight oil production has increased resource availability significantly. as well as introduced a fast responding marginal supply source operating on market principles rather than political ones. The emergence of tight oil production has altered OPEC’s strategic options and led to a period of lower and less volatile oil prices. However. this condition of world oil supply can only last as long as the unconventional resource base allows. and. at the same time. total fossil fuel consumption will have to fall to …,True,6yLMLH8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,1,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1206408,936306716419923937,/scholar?cites=936306716419923937,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1206408,0,0,0
1316637,World oil supply in the 21st century: A bottom-up perspective,2020,Henrik Wachtmeister,,,,,,Oil-fuelled progress was a defining feature of the 20th century. and still today. oil remains the world’s largest primary energy source. Yet. oil is a non-renewable and carbon-intensive resource. either depletion or resulting carbon emissions will ultimately limit its use. This thesis investigates the potential and dynamics of world oil supply in order to increase the understanding of this defining dilemma of the 21st century. Specifically. it focusses on the different characteristics of conventional oil and the recently emerged unconventional tight oil. and their associated implications. It does so from a bottom-up perspective by combining physical and economic dynamics on the individual field and well levels. The thesis is based on six papers. The first examines the usefulness of bottom-up modelling by a retrospective analysis of past oil projections. The second investigates how unconventional tight oil can be modelled on the well level using decline curve analysis. The third derives typical production parameters for conventional offshore oil fields. The fourth compares the production dynamics of conventional oil and tight oil and discusses possible oil market and climate policy implications. The fifth employs a fully calibrated bottom-up model to explore potential future world oil supply and derives implied estimates of price elasticity of supply for different segments. The sixth paper analyses past global projections of all energy sources to quantify the impact of policy. including the impact on future oil demand. The results show that conventional oil supply is inelastic in the short term. and its upside production potential resource-constrained in the long term.

Solardächer. Windparks und Biogasanlagen sollen in Zukunft die Stromversorgung klimaverträglich machen. Allerdings ist keineswegs ausgemacht. wie schnell der Umstieg auf erneuerbare Energien vollzogen wird oder wie ein regeneratives Energiesystem aussehen wird. Vor allem aber: Wer sind die gesellschaftlichen Träger eines solchen Transformationsprozesses hin zu einer Green Economy auf Seiten des Kapitals? In der Bundesrepublik ist dessen «grüne Basis» eine sich seit den 1980er Jahren aus dem ökoalternativen Milieu herausbildende neue Kapitalfraktion. Die etablierten kapitalistischen Strukturen. allen voran die oligopolistischen Stromkonzerne. standen ihr lange als Blockierende gegenüber. Erst mit dem Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz. das erstmals im Jahr 2000 verabschiedet wurde. konnten die Anbieter regenerativer Energien aus der Nische heraustreten und sich zu ernsthaften Konkurrenten entwickeln.

While the EU as a whole is showing declining carbon emissions. transport-related emissions are higher than in 1990. Car traffic is responsible for around 12 percent of the EU’s total greenhouse gas emissions. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen underlined the efforts to strengthen the decarbonization of the EU at the end of 2019 by publishing the European Green Deal (EGD) communication. In this paper. we analyze the controversy surrounding the emission performance standards for cars adopted in spring 2019. Car manufacturers must reduce the average carbon emissions of their fleets by 37.5% between 2021 and 2030. In this respect. the new emission performance standards are more ambitious than the previous ones. However. our argument is that without a major shift in the balance of power. extensive decarbonization and a departure from car-centered transport development will not be possible. Therefore. it is crucial for mobility research to critically engage with lobbying power in the EU and with concepts such as environmental leadership. which often underexpose the structural power of incumbent actors and existing path dependencies.

Co-Creation and Corporatism in the German Energy and Mobility Transitions,2020,Jeremias Herberg and Tobias Haas and Daniel Oppold and Dirk von Schneidemesser,12,Sustainability,8,3278,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In this article. we critically discuss the role of collaboration in Germany’s path towards a post-carbon economy. We consider civic movements and novel forms of collaboration as a potentially transformative challenger to the predominant approach of corporatist collaboration in the mobility and energy sectors. However. while trade unions and employer organizations provide a permanent and active arena for policy-oriented collaboration. civil society groups cannot rely on an equivalently institutionalized corridor to secure policy impact and public resonance. In that sense. conventional forms of collaboration tend to hinder the transformation towards a post-carbon economy. Collaboration in the German corporatist setting is thus. from a sustainability perspective. simultaneously a problem and a solution. We argue for more institutionalized corridors between civil society and state institutions. Co-creation. as we would like to call this methodical approach to collaborating. can be anchored within the environmental and industrial policy arenas.

1316665,Greening the car? Conflict dynamics within the german platform for electric mobility,2020,Ina Richter and Tobias Haas,12,Sustainability,19,8043,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The environmental crisis due to air pollution. high CO 2 emissions. noise from traffic and soil ceiling requires profound changes to the car-dependent transport system. This article examines the political dynamics of German transport politics. focusing on the National Platform for Electric Mobility (NPE). a high-level political forum that aimed to accelerate the run-up of the electric mobility market in Germany. The NPE provides an interesting case to study the strategies of stakeholders in influencing policy-making and shaping alternative pathways to the car-centered transport system. The paper focusses on actor constellations and the conflicts that arise within the NPE. as well as the temporal dynamics within the electric mobility debate. The findings suggest that the NPE contributed to a narrow understanding of mobility transformation based on road transport and electric cars. but that it is better described as ecological modernization. Within this narrow framework. a fundamental conflict unfolds between strong advocates versus those slowing down the ecological modernization of the car. A third group demands at least a partial departure from the automobile-centered model but remains marginalized within the NPE. Aside from this core conflict. members of the NPE struggled over the location for battery cell production. the introduction of a purchase grant known as the environmental bonus. and the expansion of battery recharging infrastructure. These issues illustrate that discussions within the NPE relate to the political debates about the future of mobility. which have intensified in Germany in recent years.

1316668,Legacy well protection refrac mitigates offset well completion communications in joint industry project,2016,James Courtier and Danny Gray and Michael Smith and Neil Stegent and James Carmichael and Magdy Hassan and Jordan Ciezobka,,,,,OnePetro,Fracture stimulation of infield or offset wells in unconventional developments can involve communication between the legacy (parent) wells and newly drilled offset (child) wells. Production from the legacy well results in a decrease in reservoir pressure and stress. which can cause pressure sinks that ultimately lead to fracturing fluid communicating between the child and parent wells. Depending on the reservoir conditions. completing infield wells can result in production losses for the parent well. and in some cases. the parent well might never fully recover its full production potential. One of the current strategies used to minimize offset well completion communication with a parent well is to perform a preemptive protection refracture of the parent well.

In typical hydraulic fracturing treatments. millions of gallons of water are pumped under pressure into rock formations deep below the earth's surface. Proppant particles such as sand are injected as part of the fracturing slurry to hold the hydraulic fractures open. or propped. after high-pressure water injection has ceased. Propped hydraulic fractures provide a conduit for long-term hydrocarbon production. thus being essential to commercial oil and gas production from shale reservoirs.

Optimizing such completions could hold the key to unlocking true value from shale reservoirs and improving well economics. Traditional hydraulic fracturing programs use the same fracture design along laterals without any consideration for changes in the reservoir and wellbore conditions.

1316682,Semblance weighted emission mapping for improved hydraulic fracture treatment characterization,2014,Debotyam Maity* and Iraj Salehi and Jordan Ciezobka,,,,2203-2207,Society of Exploration Geophysicists,Microseismic surveys typically involve surface deployments. wellbore arrays or a combination of the two. Surface microseismic surveys are often very resource intensive due to their large apertures and receiver count. On the other hand. downhole arrays are often deployed within existing wells in the field which leads to constrained design apertures and failure of imaging algorithms traditionally used with surface deployments for characterizing the observed microseismicity. At the same time. hypocentral inversion algorithms used with wellbore arrays have many well understood limitations and their use leads to many valid events being discarded. We introduce a simple emission mapping approach which can be applied on microseismic data from either borehole or surface arrays and provides a temporal energy emission profile as observed during treatment.

1316693,Navigating the limitations of energy poverty: Lessons from the promotion of improved cooking technologies in Kenya,2012,Temilade Sesan,47,Energy Policy,,202-210,Elsevier,Energy poverty has been defined as the lack of access of households in developing countries to modern energy sources. and their consequent reliance on solid biomass fuels for cooking. Improved stoves have been promoted by development actors since the 1970s to alleviate various environmental and health problems associated with biomass use. with largely disappointing outcomes. Against this background. this paper examines the intervention of an international development organisation – Practical Action – in West Kochieng. Kenya. where the organisation's energy poverty alleviation efforts are aimed at addressing the health hazards of biomass smoke with six ‘low-cost’ improved cooking technologies.

However. uptake of these stoves by poor households in the South remains low. bearing negatively on efforts to alleviate energy poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Cham,Improved stoves targeted at the 2.6 billion people worldwide that use solid biomass for cooking have not been taken up in the numbers expected by donors and practitioners. Following widespread critique of the subsidy-based dissemination models popular in the 1970s and 1980s. donors have begun to emphasise the potential of market-based models to increase stove adoption rates. In analysing the USEPA project implemented by Practical Action in western Kenya. this paper examines how a market-based approach has translated in the kind of informal economy operated by many biomass-reliant communities. The paper concludes that a context-responsive approach is likely to facilitate the dissemination of locally appropriate interventions. but it may not always be compatible with mainstream visions of large-scale stove deployment.,True,kVjg-d4AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15964-5_21,7548085898776348269,/scholar?cites=7548085898776348269,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7813/bd351b04c686ca312b3fe79d456683a85756.pdf#page=66,0,0,0

Our paper assesses the inputs to policymaking in this context and interrogates the role of scientific evidence and knowledge co-production in the process. Through key informant interviews and participatory workshops with stakeholders. we addressed the practical question of how to strengthen the contribution of evidence to national energy policymaking processes. Two windows of opportunity were identified for this: the critical stage of problem definition; and the time lag between policy adoption and implementation. By engaging proactively with policymakers on these fronts. academic researchers working in knowledge co-production arrangements can make quick inroads into a policy space that has largely excluded them to date.

1316707,Leaving the old behind,2021,Temilade Sesan,,Nature Energy,,1-2,Nature Publishing Group,Governments in Africa and other developing regions have long grappled with the question of how to move their populations from traditional energy sources (such as wood and charcoal) to modern ones (mainly gas and electricity). Considerable effort has gone into researching the factors that influence the uptake of modern energy sources in different contexts. Wealth emerged early on as a key explanatory factor. with higher household income levels associated with higher rates of modern energy uptake. Subsequent studies have shown. however. that higher income levels do not necessarily preclude traditional energy use; rather. poor households often ‘stack’newly acquired fuels and technologies on top of existing ones. severely undercutting the health and environmental gains that a clean break with the old would bring about 1.

Dr Temilade Sesan. a current INGSA Research Associate. hosted an energy policy workshop in Abuja titled ‘Where’s the evidence? How to inform policy and processes for improved energy access in Nigeria.’The workshop was the first of two planned for the one-year duration of her INGSA research project titled ‘Strengthening the contribution of scientific evidence to household energy policymaking: The case of Nigeria’. The immediate objectives of the workshop were to open up lines of communication among energy researchers. practitioners and policymakers. and to establish a platform for jointly framing the perception of scientific evidence among these stakeholder groups. In the short to medium term. the findings from the workshop are expected to provide a reference point for engaging with the process of developing the National Energy Master Plan (NEMP) and the National Renewable Energy and Efficiency Policy (NREEEP). both of which are still in draft form. A longer-term objective of the workshop (as well as all the other components of the project) is to foster mutual trust and respect among different stakeholder groups in the energy sector. particularly between academic researchers and other suppliers of scientific evidence on the one hand and policymakers and practitioners on the other.The workshop was divided into two main parts: a series of talks by a selection of energy and policy experts (three in all). followed by a question-and-answer session with participants; and a breakout session which required participants to share their experiences of applying evidence in decision-making situations on the job.

One of the most under-researched areas is health facility management. This study investigated health facilities under the pilot performance-based financing (PBF) scheme in Nigeria. and aimed to understand which factors differentiated primary health care centers (PHCCs) which had performed well. vs those which had not. with a focus on health facility management practices. We used a multiple case study where we compared two high-performing PHCCs and two low-performing PHCCs for each of the two PBF target states. Two teams of two trained local researchers spent 1 week at each PHCC and collected semi-structured interview. observation and documentary data. Data from interviews were transcribed. translated and coded using a framework approach. The data for each PHCC were synthesized to understand dynamic interactions of different elements in each case. We then compared the characteristics of high and low performers. The areas in which critical differences between high and low-performers emerged were: community engagement and support; and performance and staff management. We also found that (i) contextual and health system factors particularly staffing. access and competition with other providers; (ii) health center management including community engagement. performance management and staff management; and (iii) community leader support interacted and drove performance improvement among the PHCCs.

1316716,The Role of Local Participation in Facilitating the Identification of Appropriate Renewable Energy Technologies in Rural Africa,2014,Temilade Sesan,19,8th,,,,Technology is understood by the majority of people to be synonymous with the operation of machines and other modern applications. That definition holds true within its limited purview. but it is only a subset of the whole meaning. Technology in its most inclusive sense actually incorporates all the technical and non-technical processes. methods and concepts which inform the design of a final product.Rural communities of developing countries operate on a small scale. often under peculiar conditions. It follows that. for any form of technology to be of maximum use to people in these communities. it should be designed and scaled to their requirements. Many renewable energy interventions in developing countries have proved to be unsustainable because of the failure of stakeholders to recognise this important requirement. and to work out ways to develop a good fit between particular technologies. their purpose and their intended users. The analysis of technical change in developing countries reveals the importance of bringing the skills and ideas of technology users into the process of generating new technologies. Agarwal (1980). cited in Barnett et al.(1982). notes how studies of the diffusion of rural technology in general can be broadly divided between those studies in which the involvement of people in the generation and adoption of the technology is seen as a necessary condition for diffusion and those which see the issue in terms of'persuading'people to use an externally conceived and developed technical package.

1316719,The lightning transient behaviour of a driven rod earth electrode in multi-layer soil,2006,Kenneth John Nixon,,,,,,The work presented extends and contributes to research in earthing and lightning protection and focuses on the transient behaviour of a driven rod earth electrode. Although previous work in this area has produced practical guidelines and models that may be used for lightning protection system design and analysis purposes. there has not been an investigation into the commonly encountered scenario of multiple layers of different soil types. particularly where high current densities cause ionisation to occur in the surrounding soil. In the research presented. the behaviour of a practical driven rod earth electrode subjected to peak impulse currents of up to 30 kA is analysed. Measurements obtained using a large-scale experiment arrangement are compared against results obtained using a time-domain circuit model simulation. It is shown that a single apparent resistivity value calculated from the steady state resistance equation and the measured steady state resistance can be used as a simplification for modelling the lightning current transient behaviour of a driven rod earth electrode in multi-layer soil.

There are several approximations that are used to overcome this shortcoming. This paper proposes a new approximation that is designed in the Laplace domain. Initial results show that the amplitude differs with that of the Heidler function by no more than 3.7%. Furthermore. the first derivative of the approximated current waveshape. dI=dt. differs with that of the Heidler function by 10.5%. This however can be explained by the steepness factor not being calibrated correctly for the same shape Heidler function. The approximation is created in the Laplace domain and therefore it is trivial to plot the …,True,mCNo30YAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,6,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6973335/,1697952896475718068,/scholar?cites=1697952896475718068,,,,0,0,0

South Africa over the period of 2010-2011 are put into two different categories: branched upward flashes and single-channel flashes. Using time-correlation methods. South African Lightning Detection (SALDN) records are matched to the photographed flashes. The SALDN interpretation of the two categories is then evaluated.

1316755,High performance control methods to reduce spatial temperature transients in emerging energy systems,2013,Mahshid Fardadi,,,,,,High temperature fuel cell systems are considered an attractive solution for distributed power generation. However. there are several issues that must be resolved before SOFCs can be used widely. Currently. high temperature fuel cells are being deployed as base-load electric generators in conjunction with intermittent energy sources such as solar or wind. Complementing the fuel cell performance with power tracking capability will be extremely useful in addressing local power demand changes or the variability of the intermittent renewable sources. The main challenge of load following in SOFC systems is to operate them within the safe operating conditions. Transient operation of SOFC results in spatial temperature fluctuations. Such fluctuations can cause thermal fatigues that reduce efficiency and stack's lifetime. Consequently. controlling SOFC spatial temperature plays an important role in minimizing fuel cell …,True,7PPEJsMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,2,https://search.proquest.com/openview/f2e79077187e60ab4285b261a91af647/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y,7645811979094325261,/scholar?cites=7645811979094325261,,,,0,0,0

Thermal management of the SOEC is achieved by use of heat from the SOFC with a heat exchanger network and control strategies. While the SOFC meets the building electricity demand and heat from its electrochemical reactions is transferred to the SOEC for endothermic heat and standby demands. Each component is physically modelled in Simulink and ultimately integrated at the system level for dynamic analyses. The current work simulates a system comprised of a wind farm in Palm Springs.

The significance of mechanisms for storing large amounts of electricity for longer time-scales is accentuated by the dynamics of renewable electricity generation that depend upon the season of the year. time of day. and the location. Conventional large-scale electricity storage technologies such as pumped-hydro and compressed-air storage systems are limited by geographical features (e.g.. access to a cavern or high elevations). Traditional rechargeable batteries are limited by the fact that energy and power capacities do not scale independently.

In electrolysis mode at low current density. the performance improvement was counteracted by the increase in open circuit voltage. but it has to be borne in mind that the pressurized gas contains higher molar free energy.,True,gRjKJ5AAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,26,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fuce.201500020,10358766145269809660,/scholar?cites=10358766145269809660,,,,0,0,0

In this study. raw anthracite coal and raw bituminous coal were investigated in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell (HDCFC). which was a combination of a solid oxide fuel cell and a molten carbonate fuel cell. Mechanical mixing was confirmed to be an efficient method of mixing coal with carbonate. The coal samples had different properties. for example. carbon content. hydrogen content. volatile matter and impurities. The results showed that the maximum power density obtained by the cell with anthracite coal was similar to that obtained by the cell with bituminous coal.

1316798,Development of tubular hybrid direct carbon fuel cell and pyrolysis of biomass for production of carbon fuel,2013,Alfredo Damiano Bonaccorso,,,,,,This study involved two avenues of investigation: a new concept of Direct Carbon Fuel Cell (DCFC) and the production of carbon from biomass. The new concept of DCFC merges a solid oxide electrolyte and a molten carbonate electrolyte called the “hybrid direct carbon fuel cell” using tubular geometry. The tubular cell was chosen for several reasons. such as sealing process. reduction of stress during the sintering process and reduction of the final size of the stack. In addition. it makes the fuelling process easier than in planar geometry.  The previous tests carried out on tubular hybrid direct carbon fuel cell at the University of St Andrews showed promising results. In fact. a power of 85 mW was achieved at 800ºC. However this temperature was too high and so the focus of the new project was on decreasing the operating temperature to 650ºC. replacing the YSZ electrolyte used in the previous configuration with an electrolyte such as GDC. which showed better performance at low temperature. YSZ was substituted for GDC in the anodes and cathode in order to prevent an increase in the interface resistance due to the possible reaction between electrolyte and electrodes at the interface.   Anodes with different proportions of NiO and GDC were investigated in order to understand the electrochemical phenomena in the presence of GDC compared to YSZ.

The ion-transport behavior of these systems is to be well understood to enhance electronic properties. It is apparent that these materials show ionic conductivity when ionic salts are dissolved in them. The mechanism of ionic mobility is still controversial. We have made an attempt to address these problems by choosing montmorillonite/poly (ethylene oxide)(PEO)/cation as a model system and systematically understanding the bonding. intercalation and ionic conductivity by Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and AC-Impedance Spectroscopy respectively. The systems of Na+-montmorillonite. Li+-montmorillonite. and Li+-montmorillonite-PEO are characterized. The XRD data showed that the Na+-montmorillonite has a d-spacing of 15.49 Å attributing to the presence of Na+ and two water layers within interlayers of MMT at room temperature. The removal of water brings the d-spacing to 9.97 Å. Solution intercalation of PEO into Li+-montmorillonite results in the enhancement of d-spacing up to 18.73 Å which readily takes up water. enhancing the d-spacing to 23.33 Å. These results show clearly that PEO is readily intercalated in montmorillonite at a composition of 6 wt% PEO. and leaching of PEO at successive washing takes place below 6 wt% of PEO.

Graphite based electrodes typically use as an anode in high-temperature molten salt deoxidation of minerals. The major objective is to fabricate mechanically compressed electrodes using local graphite and kaolinite to improve electrical conductivity. mechanical strength. thermal stability and durability. The composites were prepared by mixing different ratios of graphite and kaolinite (20:80. 40:60. 50:50. 60:40 and 80:20) followed by continuous stirring of the content for 1 hr at the rate of 1100 rpm. The fabrication of rod-shaped electrodes (length and diameter are around 3.00 × 10-2 m and 1.00 × 10-2 m. respectively) was achieved by pressing    8.50 × 10-3 kg of composite material (under 1.03 × 104 N ram force) using a specially designed stainless steel mould.

The fabrication of graphite-bentonite (layered clay) electrodes (cylindrical) was achieved by mixing raw materials in distilled water (graphite to bentonite ratio of 20:80. 40:60. 50:50. 60:40 and 80:20). stirring the content for 1h at 800 rpm and finally pressing the dry composite material (1.00 × 10-2 kg) under 1.03 × 104 N ram force to obtain the electrodes with 4.00 × 10-2 m longer and 1.00 × 10-2 m in diameter. respectively. The compressed electrodes were fired at around 823 K for 1 h. The resistivity of fired electrodes was calculated subsequent to the resistance measurements. Results indicate that the electrode with 80% graphite is accounted for lowest resistivity (1.00 × 10-3 Ω m) whereas the highest resistivity for electrode containing 20% of graphite (1.10 × 10-2 Ω m). The resistivity range between the electrode with the lowest and highest amount of graphite is narrower for graphite-bentonite electrodes. unlike other graphite-clay based electrodes. It is also evident that the resistivity is abruptly decreased with the increased amount of graphite. The fired electrodes are very stable in both molten salts and aqueous solutions. A very high affinity of bentonite towards graphite is observed that further ensures stronger and homogeneous electrode matrix. The uniform composite matrix with minimum defects is accounted for a substantial electrical continuity and low resistivity across the entire electrode.

Simulation results were validated by comparison to experiments at pressures of 1–25 MPa and residence times of up to 450 s using a PFR model. Results showed agreement for nitrogen-based species above 15 MPa. For carbon-based species close agreement between experiments and simulations was observed at all pressures. In several conditions. experimental trends were successfully reproduced in the simulation results. Increased pressure and residence time were both found to have a positive effect on pollutant reduction. However. the pressure effect was found to be dominant. A sensitivity analysis was used to identify potential pressure dependent rate limiting reactions during combustion.

Aqueous urea ammonium nitrate was previously suggested as a low carbon nitrogen-based alternative fuel. Investigation of the processes which occur in the condensed phase as the temperature increases is crucial in order to understand the combustion mechanism of the suggested alternative fuel. Isomerization of urea into ammonium cyanate as well as urea hydrolysis was inhibited in the presence of ammonium nitrate. hence the fuel is considered to be chemically stable at room temperature.

To solve this problem. a new bench-scale rotary kiln reactor with alumina balls was used for the pyrolysis of organosolv lignin. Also. a bench-scale fixed-bed reactor was used as a reference reactor to gain an insight on the pyrolysis phenomena from rotary kiln reactor. Compared to the fixed bed reactor. the rotary kiln reactor resulted in a higher yield of organic phase oil with high selectivity to monomeric phenolic compounds.

In this article. we investigate the demand response potential for the case where substituting technologies are available in an energy-intensive industrial production process. The available production technologies may not only differ in their technical characteristics. but also vary by the necessary input materials. We present a generic linear optimization model for such a production process and apply it to a real-world example in the paper industry. The results show that the question of which substituting technologies are used in an optimal production schedule to which degree. is highly influenced by the combination of current input parameters such as prices. In direct consequence. the corresponding demand response potential is not a fixed number. From an operational perspective. this input dependency implies that the price relation of raw input materials used in substituting technologies can be a crucial driving force for the ability and willingness of industrial enterprises to provide demand response. In addition. from a strategic perspective. long-run investments in demand response potentials may rely on expected price development of major input factors.

We assume that the transmission system operator is incentivized to minimize redispatch cost and compare cost-based redispatch (CBR) to market-based redispatch (MBR) mechanisms. For networks with at least three nodes we show that in contrast to CBR. in the case of MBR incentives to minimize redispatch cost are in general not efficient in the context of our short-run analysis. This obtains both for pay-as-bid as well as locational marginal prices used for MBR compensation. As we demonstrate. moreover. in case of MBR the possibility of the transmission system operator to inefficiently reduce redispatch cost at the expense of decreased overall welfare can be driven both by the electricity supply side and the electricity demand side.

However. relevant information on the highly asset-specific flexibility potential is typically only known to plant operators themselves and not. e.g.. to transmission system operators.

1316900,How Different Electricity Pricing Systems Affect the Energy Trilemma: Assessing Indonesia’s Electricity Market Transition,2021,Jonathan Wagner and Martin Weibelzahl and Raphael J Heffron and Marc-Fabian Körner and Gilbert Fridgen,,,,,,Many countries have a clear policy objective of increasing their share of renewable energy sources (RESs). However. a major impediment to higher RES penetration often lies in the historically grown structures of a country’s electricity sector. In Indonesia. policy makers have relied on cheap fossil fuels and state control to provide the population with access to both reliable and affordable electricity. However. this focus on only two of the three horns of the energy trilemma. namely energy security and energy equity (and not sustainability). may put Indonesia at risk of missing its ambitious RES targets. In this context. a number of small-scale reform attempts to promote RES integration in recent years have proved to be relatively unsuccessful. Like many other countries.

However. in contrast to traditional energy systems that relied on few central power plants. RES are typically highly decentral and spread all over a country. Against this backdrop. the promotion of a decentralization of the energy system by fostering a regional balance of energy demand and supply with a corresponding increase in energy democracy is seen as a promising approach.

Internationale Tagung Wirtschaftsinformatik,,,,[en] Even though globalization has led to larger. faster. and more efficient supply chains. at the same time the new worldwide interconnection has also resulted in major challenges with respect to hidden systemic risks. In particular. there is a lack of a holistic perspective on the entire supply network. This missing global view prohibits the anamnesis and management of underlying risks. Against this backdrop. in this paper we discuss the potential contributions of Blockchain technology to systemic risk management in global supply chains and networks. Given the increasing number of recent initiatives of businesses in the context of Blockchain. we argue that Blockchain technology can lower the hurdle for the use of secure multiparty computation. Ultimately. it may be possible to implement a corresponding monitoring mechanism for systemic risks without (i) the need of a central authority and (ii) revealing competition relevant. confidential information to other supply network participants.,True,jpRyACwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/44500,,,,,https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/44500/1/How%20can%20a%20Blockchain%20Contribute%20to%20the%20Management%20of%20Systematic%20Risks.pdf,0,0,0

In particular. budget-constrained airports decide on the first level on their optimal runway capacity extension and on a corresponding airport charge. Airports anticipate optimal long-term fleet investment of airlines on the second level. optimal medium-term aircraft scheduling on the third level. and short-term outcomes of a competitive ticket market on the fourth level. We compare this market model with an integrated single-level benchmark model that simultaneously accounts for all investment. scheduling. and market clearing constraints.

After one year of presidential proposals. 21 laws were enacted in August. 2014. The analysis shows inconsistencies and lacunae in defining an open electricity market. According to the proposed reform. incumbent Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) will keep transmission and distribution vertically integrated with newly created subsidiaries subject to third-party subcontracting. while private generation participants will compete in a wholesale market operated by Centro Nacional de Control de Energía (CENACE). Following an institutional economics approach and a framework to account for transition and coordination issues. the problem of misaligned incentives is analyzed along two governance dimensions: regulatory failure and market foreclosure.

While much attention has been devoted to information and communication technologies. this analysis shows that innovation infrastructures should be understood as a broad framework for social and economic activities that transcends any specific technology and should be tied to attitudes and behaviors oriented towards the exploitation of change by adding value. This work builds on the idea of inclusive learning. which entails a process of shared prosperity across the globe following local-specific conditions. Inclusive learning also argues that it is crucial to understand the features of knowledge-induced growth in rich countries. as well as the challenges and opportunities for late-industrialized and less developed countries. To achieve these objectives. the relative importance of infrastructures and incentives is considered an increasingly important role in institutions towards the development of social capital.

While the direct effects of manufacturing exports on employment generation are generally positive. they are also small. The unobserved total multiplier effects of apertura. while al-most certainly larger. will take time to establish a pattern and work them-selves through the economy. In terms of public policy. the findings suggest caution in anticipating manufacturing exports to noticeably stem the flow of Mexican workers to the United States. There are simply too many other important considerations that come into play. Among the most sa-lient are: the fragility of political support for apertura within Mexico. the consistency of macroeconomic and trade policies. the modernization of the rural economy. the sustainability of the demand for Mexico's exports. the availability and proper targeting of investment in physical and human capital. and. most importantly. the wide gap in wages between the,True,YKbS698AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,6,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZvJkAAAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP4&dq=info:Zgote-Bc9vcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=cp59Az04xV&sig=5NMrBkVhQoccp89FJi6uK19ZcZw,17867570690848000614,/scholar?cites=17867570690848000614,,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZvJkAAAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP4&dq=info:Zgote-Bc9vcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=cp59Az04xV&sig=5NMrBkVhQoccp89FJi6uK19ZcZw,0,0,0

The challenge is to establish transmission tariffs that provide signals for efficient usage of the existing network and demand for new network capacity. Mexico's liberalized electricity market exemplifies the changing responsibilities in transmission planning. Through the adoption of locational marginal pricing. the Mexican market is well positioned to capture congestion costs and motivate efficient behavior. We highlight some of the potential problems that Mexico's currently planned approach and transmission tariffs could raise for generation location incentives.

Trade in electricity is argued to increase reliability and security at the same time that states relinquish part of their control attributions towards international pools and markets. The chapter shows that electricity can share the characteristics of an essential resource to a country. to be protected. with the concept of being a tradable good or service. As a framework for analysis. it then shows that the insufficient US-Mexican set of interconnections makes this market an outlier vis a vis other heavier trading areas and investment projects. and this offers great opportunities to increasingly share a common policy vision and joint physical interconnection strategies. One important lesson from heavier trade and investment markets across the world is the separation between transmission and generation. not necessarily the property of the modern electricity markets by the state or private interests.,True,YKbS698AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.455.2811&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=20,,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.455.2811&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=20,0,0,0

The proposed policies. including an approximation to the Kyoto protocol. are shown to differ greatly in how they mitigate climate change. support economic growth. and allocate rents across generations. Benefits of alternative policies. relative to the status quo. do not necessarily accrue to the generations that bear the costs. The results also show that the chosen rent distribution rule has a profound effect on policy evaluation. In particular. policies which allocate rents on a per-capita basis are shown to be systematically welfare-preferred to situations where emissions rights are grandfathered to emitting firms.

Our analysis suggests sustained activity in the sector in the medium- to long-term even with challenging changes in the surrounding economic and policy circumstances (in particular low oil prices and a redoubled commitment to more aggressive climate policies by Canada’s provincial and federal governments). However. a combination of an expectation of a sustained increase in benchmark oil prices and the expected relaxation of transportation constraints will be needed to stimulate significant additional growth in production. We provide an overview of the basic production economics. as well as the economics and politics of getting product to market by pipeline and rail.

1316955,Carbon cost will not stop oil-sands work,2014,Andrew Leach and Branko Boskovic,511,Nature,7511,534-534,Nature Publishing Group,Wendy Palen and colleagues propose a moratorium on new oil-sands projects until regulations are in place to ensure compliance with carbon-emissions commitments (Nature 510. 465–467; 2014). We question whether such a ban is justified on the basis of the criteria they propose. Emissions from oil-sands production are generally less than 0.1 tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel. so production costs would increase by at most US $6.50 per barrel if social costs were accounted for as the authors suggest. The social cost of carbon is estimated at about $65 per tonne of CO2 equivalent over the lifespan of an oilsands project (see go. nature. com/9ztmyu).However. many projects would remain viable despite this production-cost increase. in part because it would be offset for developers by tax and royalty deductions.

1316956,Leave it in the ground? Oil sands extraction in the carbon bubble,2014,Branko Boškovic and Andrew Leach,,,,,,This paper develops a model of oil sands development to investigate three related questions. First. we ask whether new oil sands developments would remain viable if current estimates of the social cost of carbon emissions were internalized into their cost structures. Second. we ask whether these same investments are likely to be viable should carbon policies consistent with achieving global climate change stabilization goals be imposed. Finally. we ask whether interactions between carbon policy and fiscal policy are responsible for the effects we observe. Our model assesses two types of oil sands investments which are representative of the projects currently expected to increase oil sands production by up to 300% from current levels of 2 million barrels per day by 2035. We find that these projects are. indeed. exposed to significant carbon policy risk. That risk arises mostly from potential changes in policies on lifecycle emissions. but these projects face limited risk when the policies are applied to production emissions as opposed to downstream emissions. Our results depend significantly on the tax and royalty regime under which oil sands production occurs in which decision-makers only face a portion of the true costs of carbon emissions. even when these costs would seem to be fully internalized through carbon prices. As such. we argue that models which do not consider these institutional details may overestimate oil production sensitivity to carbon policies.,True,-as0RpQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,3,https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/economics/docs/leach-oil-sands.pdf,7909268170825306934,/scholar?cites=7909268170825306934,,,https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/economics/docs/leach-oil-sands.pdf,0,0,0
1316957,Leave it in the ground? Incorporating the social cost of carbon into oil sands development,2017,Branko Boškovic and Andrew Leach,,,,,,We evaluate the impact of imposing the social cost of carbon on new oil sands projects. Using data from recent oil sands projects and estimates of the social cost of carbon. we estimate the minimum prices required to make these projects economically viable. Our results indicate oil sands are a marginal resource before they incur any carbon costs. The viability of oil sands then depends on the incidence of the social cost of carbon. but projects are not likely viable. even under optimistic future price forecasts. if producers bear most of the costs from life-cycle emissions. We also find an important interaction between resource royalties and carbon charges: the impact of the cost of carbon varies with where it is imposed across life-cycle emissions.,True,-as0RpQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Branko_Boskovic2/publication/320685340_Leave_it_in_the_ground_Incorporating_the_social_cost_of_carbon_into_oil_sands_development/links/59f40933458515547c206d12/Leave-it-in-the-ground-Incorporating-the-social-cost-of-carbon-into-oil-sands-development.pdf,13426671430646836909,/scholar?cites=13426671430646836909,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Branko_Boskovic2/publication/320685340_Leave_it_in_the_ground_Incorporating_the_social_cost_of_carbon_into_oil_sands_development/links/59f40933458515547c206d12/Leave-it-in-the-ground-Incorporating-the-social-cost-of-carbon-into-oil-sands-development.pdf,0,0,0

The model proposed in this paper allows for a model in which we weigh observations on temperature against the potential that these are generated by a combination of uncertain parameters; namely the coefficient of autoregression and the sensitivity of temperature change to atmospheric carbon levels. This paper shows that. contrary to predictions in the literature that we can resolve uncertainty very quickly. the time to learn may be on the order of thousands of years when uncertainty surrounds two parameters in the law of motion for temperature. When the learning model is embedded in an optimal policy growth model. policy decisions are found to be affected by the prior mean but not the variance.

We show that while welfare can be significantly enhanced by transferring policy rents to agents. the same is not necessarily true of allocations of rents to research and development subsidies. In fact. we show that it is possible that research and development subsidies are pareto-dominated by a transfer of all rents to agents.

1316973,An early warning signals approach for currency crises: the Turkish case,2008,Ali Ari,,,,,,In the last fifteen years four crisis episodes occurred in the Turkish economy in April 1994. February 2001. May 2006 and October 2008. These local crises with minor effects on other countries led nevertheless to severe economic and social consequences in terms of increasing domestic interest rates. large international reserves losses. large currency depreciations. high output losses and high unemployment rates. This paper aims to illustrate the essential determinants of these crises by developing a binary and multivariate logit model which estimates the predictive ability of sixteen economic and financial indicators in a sample that covers the period January 1990-December 2008. The paper finds that the Turkish crises are mainly due to excessive budget deficits. high money supply growths. sharp rises in short-term external debt. growing riskiness of the banking system (in particular currency and liquidity mismatches). and external adverse shocks.,True,HyXiKDsAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,9,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/id/eprint/25858,9021331332179374265,/scholar?cites=9021331332179374265,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/25858/1/MPRA_paper_25858.pdf,0,0,0

Recent technological advancements in electricity fuels. generation technologies. and environmental policies which target specific generation technologies (eg emission regulations) have motivated detailed CGE modeling of the electricity sector. Modeling these issues requires distinct electricity generating technologies in a CGE database. Researchers using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Data Base have disaggregated the electricity sector into generating technologies independently using largely disparate. incomparable methodologies. This paper presents the methodology used to create the GTAP-Power Data Base. an electricity-detailed extension of the GTAP 9 Data Base with the following disaggregated electricity sectors: transmission and distribution. nuclear. coal. gas. hydroelectric. wind. oil. solar. and other. Gas. oil. and hydroelectric are further differentiated as base and peak load. The bottom-up data are electricity generation and levelized input costs for each technology and region. The levelized input costs for each technology are estimated to be as close as possible to the original data. but consistent with the original GTAP 9 Data Base. Major limitations in the initial version of the GTAP-Power Data Base are the lack of regional coverage in input cost data and disparity between available data and the total values for the electricity aggregate.

Electric power substitution is represented with a nested additive constant elasticity of substitution which. opposed to the traditional constant elasticity of substitution. ensures that the sum of demands for generation from each technology is equal to total demand for electricity generation.

Generating technologies can substitute via two distinct. but interdependent mechanisms: i) utilization-ie adjustment of operations of existing capacity and ii) expansion-ie decommissioning and construction of capacity. We develop a framework for analyzing these interdependent mechanisms. then construct and validate an empirical model of the US electricity sector using recent data. Assuming current low gas prices persist. increasing utilization of gas (at the expense of higher-emitting coal) will drive higher returns to gas capacity. As a result. under our business-as-usual scenario for 2030 (no CPP) we project approximately 26% less CO2 emissions than 2005 levels. indicating that the CPP target could be met with only limited policy intervention.,True,9WVSwnIAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,19,https://www.iaee.org/energyjournal/article/2977,14993494635511332431,/scholar?cites=14993494635511332431,,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2977,0,0,0

If the total cost (column) constraint is relaxed. economic relationships both between inputs to and/or amongst the sub-sectors may not be preserved (i.e. cost structure and row share. respectively). These relationships are significant in modeling. where production behavior depends on relative costs. This paper presents a share preserving cross-entropy (SPCE) approach which targets economic relationships directly and allows the column constraint to be relaxed. Further. the SPCE solution is identical to the RAS solution when the column constraint is imposed. This cross-entropy formulation complements an existing sum squared error-type approach.

Due to the non-renewable nature of fossil fuels. energy security has evolved into a strategic goal for the United States. The transportation sector accounts for about 30% of the energy consumed by the US As the emergent and strategic linkages between the two sectors are becoming increasingly apparent from a qualitative perspective. there is an evolving consensus that national. regional. and local policy goals may not be achievable completely or effectively by focusing on one sector at a time. For example. the increase in the market penetration of electric vehicle has brought many advantages and challenges along with it on both transportation as well as the energy sector. Such challenges for transportation sector include reduction of highway maintenance budgets due to a reduction in gasoline sales. and that for energy sector include increased power demand during specific times of the day. thereby affecting daily power generation operations.

Around the world. high-speed rail (HSR) is seen as a way to mitigate the risk of volatile petroleum prices while alleviating congestion on highways and at airports. However. HSR is a contentious issue in the United States due to justifiable concerns of ridership and the large capital investment. Ridership is the critical element in determining the viability of a large capital. long-term transportation investment in terms of costs. revenue and the resulting societal impacts. This paper analyzes the potential for high-speed rail as part of the existing multimodal transportation system in a region. It provides a systematic methodology for analyzing transportation systemwide modal ridership with and without a proposed HSR network. Demographic. technological. economic. and policy trends are used to project ridership in the long-term. Experiments are conducted for the US Midwest corridor. but the methodology is extendable and modular to incorporate any mode in any region. The results show that passenger rail and commercial air ridership will increase at a faster rate than the road mode due to rising gasoline prices. The level-of-service and operational characteristics of HSR are critical in attracting ridership.

This task is particularly arduous to accomplish in real-time. due to the complexity and nonlinearities. as well as the inevitable presence of on-board measurements errors. The objective of this paper is to develop a NiMH battery model which accounts for the relevant dynamics related to HEV applications. A detailed series of experiments allowed for system identification to be performed in order to design an equivalent electrical circuit model of the battery. where capacitors take care of voltage relaxations. while resistors model all forms of energy losses. Experimental results are then compared with model prediction. resulting in variances limited to less than 3.5%.

Some crucial issues in mass identification impede an easy implementation of such an algorithm. however. and this work introduces a simple method to calculate EV mass on-the-fly using standard data available on most CAN buses and therefore without the need of additional sensors. The results presented here are achieved using an eight step technique suitable for accurate mass estimations during wide-open-throttle acceleration events. The algorithm’s instantaneous error is less than 10%. and converges to better than 3% absolute accuracy performance with subsequent measurements.

The robust algorithms for estimating four characteristic parameters of electric two-wheelers are based on a linear dynamics model that is considered to be as simple as possible yet as complex as necessary to characterize the vehicles. The model equations are investigated analytically for their ability to find unique solutions. and it is shown that multiple solutions may exist. The algorithms are tested for their ability to handle various data frequencies. levels of noise. and initial guesses.

In this paper a methodology is presented for finding the optimal size of the main components for a solar thermal system where particular attention is given to the optimization framework. The use of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed and the results obtained are compared with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) solution. Further. the relative influence of certain system parameters on the optimal configuration is investigated by means of a sensitivity analysis where the size of the collector is shown to have the greatest influence on all main output quantities while the size of the auxiliary power unit presents a relatively negligible influence on the solution. Finally. it is demonstrated that the accurate sizing of the energy components is necessary to minimize the energy consumption and cost of installation. while maximizing the solar fraction.

Children normally perform at distinctly lower levels than adults. Moreover. evidence in adults suggests that sleep dependent offline gains in skill essentially depend on the pre-sleep level of performance. Against this background. we asked whether improving children’s performance on a motor sequence learning task by extended training to levels approaching those of adults would enable sleep-associated gains in motor skill in this age group also. Children (4–6 years) and adults (18–35 years) performed on the motor sequence learning task (button-box task) before and after 2-hour retention intervals including either sleep (midday nap) or wakefulness. Whereas one group of children and adults. respectively. received the standard amount of 10 blocks of training before retention intervals of sleep or wakefulness. a further group of children received an extended training on 30 blocks (distributed across 3 days). A further group of adults received a restricted training on only two blocks before the retention intervals. Children after standard training reached lowest performance levels. whereas in adults performance after standard training was highest. Children with extended training and adults after reduced training reached intermediate performance levels.

1317025,Fast algorithms for the optimization of energy systems,2012,Raffaele G Bornatico,,,,,,Software simulations in the building technology field are essential for designing efficient systems. However. with the tools that are currently available. the time necessary to complete a simulation is for specific applications prohibitively long. thus creating the need for faster simulations. Instances of such situations are web-based applications. real-time parameter sensitivity analyses or fast numeric optimization routines. The goal of this thesis is to develop a novel approach for the fast computation of accurate simulation results.The proposed solution is based on sampling and interpolation techniques. In a first step. a series of selected parameter combinations is simulated. and the results are stored. At execution time. the simulation results for any other combination of parameters are computed by interpolating the previously stored results. This procedure proves to be significantly less demanding than computing the entire simulation. Accordingly. the investigation covers both the analysis of the optimal distribution of sampling nodes and the development of an effective interpolation algorithm. The smallest interpolation error is achieved by the Poisson disk node distribution. Based on a review of several algorithms for the generation of such a distribution. the dart-throwing algorithm is selected to distribute nodes inside the 12-dimensional unit hypercube. The fact that such highdimensional spaces require a large number of interpolation nodes causes accurate global methods to be fundamentally inefficient. Hence a local interpolation algorithm that relies on the nearest nodes has been developed. A notable finding is that the loss of accuracy of the proposed …,True,vrq9GUcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/63054/1/eth-6250-01.pdf,,,,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/63054/eth-6250-02.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

1317040,High Resolution Modeling of the Impacts of Exogenous Factors on Power Systems—Case Study of Germany,2015,Antriksh Singh and Patrick Eser and Ndaona Chokani and Reza Abhari,8,Energies,12,14168-14181,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In order to reliably design the planning and operation of large interconnected power systems that can incorporate a high penetration of renewables. it is necessary to have a detailed knowledge of the potential impacts of exogenous factors on individual components within the systems. Previously. the assessment has often been conducted with nodes that are aggregated at the country or regional scale; this makes it impossible to reliably extrapolate the impact of higher penetration of renewables on individual transmission lines and/or power plants within an aggregated node. In order to be able to develop robust power systems this study demonstrates an integrated framework that employs high resolution spatial and temporal. physical modeling of power generation. electricity transmission and electricity demand. across the scale of a continent or country. Using Germany as a test case. an assessment of the impacts of exogenous factors. including local changes in ambient weather conditions. effect of timely implementation of policy. and contingency for scenarios in 2020 are demonstrated. It is shown that with the increased penetration of renewables. while the power production opportunities of conventional power plants are reduced. these power plants are required during periods of low renewables production due to the inherent variability of renewables. While the planned reinforcements in Germany. including high voltage direct current lines. reduce congestion on the grid and alleviate the differentials in power price across the country. on the other hand the reinforcements make the interconnected transmission system more vulnerable as local …,True,ZDUZOK8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/8/12/14168,3457205916690479990,/scholar?cites=3457205916690479990,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/8/12/12424/pdf,0,0,0

1317045,Long term EU electricity supply scenarios: Impact of EU electricity policies on Switzerland,,Ramachandran Kannan and Tom Kober and Antriksh Singh,,,,,,In the Base scenario. EU electricity sector’s CO2 emissions reduce by 60% in 2050 relative to 2010 level. However. reducing the remaining CO2 emission is challenging and incurs high cost. By 2050. over 700 GW of solar PV and 550 GW of wind turbines supply 40% of the electricity demand (Fig. 2) in the LC95 scenario. This high share of RES requires large electricity storage (and curtailment) to cope with the diurnal and seasonal variabilities. At increasing climate change mitigation ambition. a shift from coal-CCS to gas-CCS can be observed to unlock further CO2 emission reductions. This comes at high operational costs due to the increasing gas price. The marginal cost of CO2 grows from 73 CHF/t CO2 in 2030 to 300 CHF/t CO2 in 2050. Additional renewables would need to be deployed together with additional storage capacity. in case CCS is excluded as an mitigation technology (LC95_NoCCS scenario in Fig. 3).,True,ZDUZOK8AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,http://www.sccer-soe.ch/export/sites/sccersoe/publications/.galleries/dwn_sciencereport2018/SCCER-SoE_Science_Report_2018_Task4-2.pdf_2063069299.pdf,,,,,http://www.sccer-soe.ch/export/sites/sccersoe/publications/.galleries/dwn_sciencereport2018/SCCER-SoE_Science_Report_2018_Task4-2.pdf_2063069299.pdf,0,0,0
1317046,Presenter's biography,,Antriksh Singh,,,,,,In recent years wind power has experienced tremendous growth. A typical onshore wind farm requires 1 sq. km for installation of 2.5-3 MW capacity. therefore large-scale development of wind farms requires extensive prospecting for ‘available’sites across a country and/or state. Nowadays. the identification of prospective sites is both time and resource intensive. often taking up to several years of on-the-field assessment. This work presents a systematic approach that both cost effectively identifies the most promising sites over a large area and minimizes the performance risk at specific sites for wind farms.A recent study conducted by ETH Zürich has examined the energy production from over 200 operational wind farms in Europe.

Therefore. these countries strongly desired to utilize more energy mainly electricity to meet required energy demand (Wichert. 1997). This situation caused a growth of some natural’s disaster such as climate changes and air pollution due to using fossil fuels as main energy sources. Thus. European countries decided to apply viable alternative energy suppliers which are sustainable and affordable (Summerer et al.. 2003). Furthermore. The Commission will offer aspiring targets for CO2 emission cuts. with the objective of limiting global climate change. Sharing of renewable energy sources in the overall energy mix will be considered as an important point and it will be also restated to improve the EU's energy efficiency by 20%. By making these decisions it is estimated that Europe will be the most energy efficient region in the world in terms of sustainability. competitiveness and security of supply (Barrosa. 2005).Regarding these perspectives. thermal solar system is pointed out as the most applicable option by European countries since 50% of European total energy is being used for heating and cooling (ESTTP. 2006) and the system has a perfect capacity. which rose from 10GWth in 2005 to 200GWth by 2030. and soon became an option on the world electricity market.

As the modern era demands the traditional power grid to be more reliable. resilient. and cost-effective. the concept of smart grid evolves and various methods have been developed to overcome these demands which make the smart grid superior over the traditional power grid. One of the essential components of the smart grid. home energy management system (HEMS) enhances the energy efficiency of electricity infrastructure in a residential area. In this aspect. we propose an efficient home energy management controller (EHEMC) based on genetic harmony search algorithm (GHSA) to reduce electricity expense. peak to average ratio (PAR). and maximize user comfort. We consider EHEMC for a single home and multiple homes with real-time electricity pricing (RTEP) and critical peak pricing (CPP) tariffs. In particular. for multiple homes. we classify modes of operation for the appliances according to their energy consumption with varying operation time slots. The constrained optimization problem is solved using heuristic algorithms: wind-driven optimization (WDO). harmony search algorithm (HSA). genetic algorithm (GA). and proposed algorithm GHSA. The proposed algorithm GHSA shows higher search efficiency and dynamic capability to attain optimal solutions as compared to existing algorithms. Simulation results also show that the proposed algorithm GHSA outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of reduction in electricity cost. PAR. and maximize user comfort.

In this work. a three-step simulation based posteriori method is proposed to develop a scheme for eco-efficient operation of HEMS. The proposed method provides the trade-off between the net cost of energy (C E n e t) and the time-based discomfort (T B D) due to shifting of home appliances (HAs). At step-1. primary trade-offs for C E n e t. T B D and minimal emissions T E M i s s are generated through a heuristic method. This method takes into account photovoltaic availability. the state of charge. the related rates for the storage system. mixed shifting of HAs. inclining block rates. the sharing-based parallel operation of power sources. and selling of the renewable energy to the utility. The search has been driven through multi-objective genetic algorithm and Pareto based optimization. A filtration mechanism (based on the trends exhibited by T E M i s s in consideration of C E n e t and T B D) is devised to harness the trade-offs with minimal emissions. At step-2. a constraint filter based on the average value of T E M i s s is used to filter out the trade-offs with extremely high values of T E M i s s. At step-3. another constraint filter (made up of an average surface fit for T E M i s s) is applied to screen out the trade-offs with marginally high values of T E M i s s. The surface fit is developed using polynomial models for regression based on the least sum of squared errors.

A set of weighting vectors is deployed while implementing algorithms and a multi-objective-optimization (MOO) problem is decomposed into single-objective sub-problems that are optimized simultaneously in a single run. Furthermore. an innovative method to carry out the diversified performance analysis (DPA) of the proposed algorithms is also proposed.

1317083,Analysis of efficient spectrum handoff in a multi-class hybrid spectrum access cognitive radio network using markov modelling,2019,Atif Shakeel and Riaz Hussain and Adeel Iqbal and Irfan Latif Khan and Shahzad Ali Malik,19,Sensors,19,4120,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) rely on sensing of the licensed spectrum of a primary network to dynamically ascertain underutilized portion of the spectrum. thus affording additional communication opportunities. In a CRN. a single homogeneous spectrum access. such as interweave only deprives the secondary users (SUs) of channel access during handoff. particularly at high primary network traffic. Therefore. providing quality-of-service (QoS) to multi-class SUs with diverse delay requirements during handoff becomes a challenging task. In this paper. we have evolved a Markov-based analytical model to ascertain the gain in non-switching spectrum handoff scheme for multi-class SUs employing hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access strategy. To satisfy the QoS requirements of the delay-sensitive traffic. we have analyzed the impact of hybrid spectrum access scheme for prioritized multi-class SUs traffic. The results show substantial improvement in spectrum utilization. average system throughput and extended data delivery time compared to conventional CRN using interweave only spectrum access. This demonstrates the suitability of the proposed scheme towards meeting QoS requirements of the delay-sensitive SU traffic while improving the overall performance for delay-tolerant SU traffic as well.

Despite the attractive benefits of integrating different wireless platforms. mobile users are confronted with the issue of detrimental handover. This paper uses extensive geometric and probabilistic techniques to develop a realistic and novel model for the coverage area of a wireless local area network (WLAN) cell with an aim to minimize unnecessary handover and handover failure of a mobile node (MN) traversing the WLAN cell from a third-generation network. The dwell time is estimated along with the threshold values to ensure an optimal handover decision by the MN. while the probability of unnecessary handover and probability of handover failure are kept within tolerable bounds. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to assess the behavior of the proposed and existing models. Simulation results showed that our proposed model is more robust and capable of keeping unnecessary handover probability and handover failure probability closest to a predefined probability benchmark. For model validation. the Nash--Sutcliffe coefficient was used to compute the efficiency of the proposed model. which achieved a value of 98.82 {\%} indicating the accuracy of the model.\vs {2mm,True,tBJSfKUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,4,https://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/elektrik/abstract.htm?id=22998,15098542738755526564,/scholar?cites=15098542738755526564,,,https://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/elektrik/issues/elk-18-26-4/elk-26-4-8-1710-200.pdf,0,0,0

1317089,Circulating Current Reduction in MMC-HVDC System Using Average Model,2019,Kamran Hafeez and Shahid A Khan and Alex Van den Bossche and Qadeer Ul Hasan,9,Applied Sciences,7,1383,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Modular multilevel converters (MMCs) are quickly emerging as a suitable technology for a voltage-source converter-based high-voltage direct-current (VSC-HVDC) transmission systems due to its numerous advantages as reported in literature. However. for a large DC-network. MMCs require large numbers of sub-modules (SMs) and switches. which makes its modeling very challenging and computationally complex using electromagnetic transient (EMT) programs. Average Value Model (AVM) provides a relatively better solution to model MMCs by combining cells as an arm equivalent circuit. Circulating current is an important issue related to the performance and stability of MMCs. Due to circulating currents. power loss in a converter increases as root mean square (RMS) values of the arm current increases. The traditional method for inserting SMs in each arm is based on direct modulation. which does not compensate for the arm voltage oscillations. and generates circulating current in each leg of a three-phase MMC. This paper presents a new method for reducing the circulating current by adding 2nd and 4th harmonics in the upper and lower arm currents of an MMC. Less capacitor energy variations are obtained by the proposed method compared to traditional direct modulation methods. The proposed method is tested on a common symmetrical monopole (point-to-point) MMC-HVDC system using vector current control strategy in PSCAD/EMTDC software. Analytical and simulation results show the effectiveness of the new method in minimizing the circulating current and arm voltage oscillation reductions as compared to the direct modulation …,True,tBJSfKUAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,3,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/7/1383,12305284088423597975,/scholar?cites=12305284088423597975,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/7/1383/htm,0,0,0

This requires efficient sensing policy at the MAC layer that can discover more idle channels in less time. Whereas. the sensing policy depends on the channel sensing order that decides how a secondary user senses the primary user band in minimum period of time. Spectrum sensing policies for searching idle channels from the underutilized primary band can significantly affect the performance of secondary user in terms of throughput. reliability. and energy efficiency. In this paper. we have analyzed MAC protocol structure for ad hoc radio networks which used random channel sensing.

1317092,Improved Buffer-Aided Multi-Hop Relaying with Reduced Outage and Packet Delay in Cognitive Radio Networks,2019,Shakeel Ahmed Alvi and Riaz Hussain and Qadeer Ul Hasan and Shahzad Ali Malik,8,Electronics,8,895,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Cognitive radio networks have emerged to exploit optimally the scarcely-available radio spectrum resources to enable evolving 5G wireless communication systems. These networks tend to cater to the ever-increasing demands of higher data rates. lower latencies and ubiquitous coverage. By using the buffer-aided cooperative relaying. a cognitive radio network can enhance both the spectral efficiency and the range of the network; although. this could incur additional end-to-end delays. To mitigate this possible limitation of the buffer-aided relaying in the underlay cognitive network. a virtual duplex multi-hop scheme. referred as buffer-aided multi-hop relaying. is proposed. which improves throughput and reduces end-to-end delays while keeping the outage probability to a minimum as well. This scheme simultaneously takes into account the inter-relay interference and the interference to the primary network. The proposed scheme is modeled as a Markov chain. and Monte Carlo simulations under various scenarios are conducted to evaluate several key performance metrics such as throughput. outage probability. and average packet delay. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms many non-buffer-aided relaying schemes in terms of outage performance. When compared with other buffer-aided relaying schemes such as max-max. max-link. and buffer-aided relay selection with reduced packet delay. the proposed scheme demonstrated better interference mitigation without compromising the delay performance as well.

1317093,Spectrum Handoff based on Imperfect Channel State Prediction Probabilities with Collision Reduction in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks,2019,Atif Shakeel and Riaz Hussain and Adeel Iqbal and Irfan Latif Khan and Qadeer Ul Hasan and Shahzad Ali Malik,19,Sensors,21,4741,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The spectrum handoff is highly critical as well as challenging in a cognitive radio ad hoc network (CRAHN) due to lack of coordination among secondary users (SUs). which leads to collisions among the SUs and consequently affects the performance of the network in terms of spectrum utilization and throughput. The target channel selection mechanism as part of handoff process can play an enormously significant role in minimizing the collisions among the SUs and improving the performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In this paper. an enhanced target channel selection scheme based on imperfect channel state prediction is proposed for the spectrum handoff among the SUs in a CRAHN. The proposed scheme includes an improved frame structure that increases coordination among the SUs in the ad hoc environment and helps in organizing the SUs according to the shortest job first principle during channel access. Unlike the existing prediction-based spectrum handoff techniques. the proposed scheme takes into account the accuracy of channel state prediction; the SUs affected due to false prediction are compensated by allowing them to contend for channel access within the same transmission cycle and thus enabling them to achieve higher throughput. The proposed scheme has been compared with the contemporary spectrum handoff schemes and the results have demonstrated substantial improvement in throughput and extended data delivery time by virtue of the reduced number of collisions.

1317105,Influence of pedestrian trajectories on school children exposure to PM10,2014,João Garcia and Rita Cerdeira and Luís Coelho and Prashant Kumar and Maria da Graça Carvalho,2014,Journal of Nanomaterials,,,Hindawi,Three pedestrian trajectories are considered to study the influence of PM10 concentrations on children exposure. in a high-traffic street canyon. Two types of exposure were calculated: daily exposure for each wind condition and cumulative annual exposure considering all wind conditions. FLUENT was used to simulate the flow. turbulence. and PM10 dispersion in the street canyon. Our results indicate that exposure is influenced by the chosen walking trajectory and wind direction. When considering daily exposure. the highest value is achieved for the trajectory on the south side of the street. under westerly wind conditions. 13% higher than the baseline that assumes no traffic. The results indicate that a particular trajectory can be better for one specific wind direction but can represent the worst for a different wind direction. A difference of 3% to 13% higher exposure was achieved by choosing the best and worst trajectories. When computing cumulative annual exposure. trajectory on the north side of the street shows better results. 8.4% higher than the baseline value. Northerly and westerly winds result in the lowest and the highest exposure value for every studied trajectory. Careful selection of the best pedestrian paths can help reduce the exposure in busy street canyons.,True,LdkYEBoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,8,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnm/2014/505649/abs/,227279621514624584,/scholar?cites=227279621514624584,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnm/2014/505649/abs/,0,0,0

The aim of the trigeneration system is to provide enough electricity. domestic hot water (DHW). heating and cooling power to meet the typical demand of an urban single family dwelling with limited roof area and allow the household to achieve a positive net energy status. The PV/T collectors and PV modules provide the electricity while the former also powers the DHW component of the trigeneration system. The heating and cooling components rely on a vapour compression cycle heat pump unit powered by electricity. In Fong et al. (2010). solar-powered electric compression refrigeration was found to have the most energy saving potential in subtropical climates. Thus. a heat pump based cooling system is a cost effective solution for residential applications in Lisbon.Portugal. Thus. according to the dwelling's location. construction details and energy demand patterns. the model computes the system's net results by comparing the dwelling demand with the trigeneration system supply.

Coal is the more abundant fossil fuel but. at the same time. presents the lower H/C ratio. implying larger CO2 emissions when used in conventional air firing furnaces. The removal of the CO2 from the combustion products of conventional fired power stations is not economically attractive due to its low concentration in the flue gases. The use of flue gas recirculation with oxygen injection. allows for the increase of CO2 concentration in the flue gases. reducing the gas flow rate to be treated.

The performance of the unit using the commercial organic paraffin A44 was studied in order to understand the thermal behavior of the system and the main parameters that influence heat transfer during the PCM melting and solidification processes. The latter will assist the design of a large-scale unit. The effect of flow rate was studied given that it significantly affects charging (melting) and discharging (solidification) processes. In addition. as organic PCMs have low thermal conductivity. the possible improvement of the PCM’s thermal behavior by means of nanoparticle addition was investigated. The obtained results were promising and showed that the use of graphite-based nanoplatelets improves the PCM thermal behavior.

Introduction Bioenergy is one of the promising choices. It is a very attractive renewable energy source 1) 2). Biogas is produced by the process of anaerobic digestion 3). Biogas has properties close to natural gas which can be used as fuel. However. biogas contains some impurities such as hydrogen sulphide (H2S). water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Trace components are targeted to while upgrading biogas to biomethane in order to adjust the calorific value and to meet requirements for some gas appliances 4)~ 6). There are various biogas purification and upgrading technologies such as absorption (water scrubbing and chemical scrubbing). adsorption (pressure swing adsorption). cryogenic separation. and membrane technology 7). One of the simplest and most common technique is absorption process 8) 9).In this work we focused on the comparison of two processes between water scrubbing and chemical scrubbing using diethanolamine (DEA) with regeneration of absorbent for purification and upgrading of biogas from swine manure. The absorption processes are modeled in Aspen Plus by considering the quality of biomethane requirement. recovery methane. energy of biomethane. and energy consumption.

In this study a computer program is presented which is capable of analyzing steam or water injected gas turbine cycles considering thermoeconomic and environmental aspects simultaneously. The program can either be used for evaluation or optimization of performance and emissions. For any kind of CαHßOγNδ fuel. it calculates properties of burned gases from the equilibrium mole fractions of the exhaust gases taking dissociations with temperature into account which gives an accurate performance estimate. Irreversibilities and pressure losses are also considered for the cycle.

Building energy efficiency has turned out to be a major issue in limiting the increasing energy demands of the sector. Literature shows that building user behavior can increase the efficiency of the energy used in the building and different strategies have been tested to address and support this issue. These strategies often combine the quantification of energy savings and qualitative interpretation of occupant behavior in order to foster energy efficiency. Strategies that influence building occupant behaviors include eco-feedback. social interaction. and gamification. This review paper presents a study conducted on the state of the art related to the impact of building user behavior on energy efficiency. in order to provide the research community with a better understanding and up-to-date knowledge of energy. comfort-related practices. and potential research opportunities. Achieving and maintaining energy-efficient behavior without decreasing the comfort of building occupants still represents a challenge. despite emerging technologies and strategies as well as general research progress made over the last decade. Conclusions highlight eco-feedback as an effective way to influence behavior. and gamification as a new opportunity to trigger behavioral change. The impact of user behavior is difficult to quantify for methodological reasons. Factors influencing human behavior are numerous and varied. Multi-disciplinary approaches are needed to provide new insights into the inner dynamic nature of occupant’s energy behavior.

1317205,Switchable selective absorber coatings for overheating protection of solar thermal collectors,2013,Antonio Paone,,,,,EPFL,Overheating is a common problem both with the use of active and passive solar energy in solar thermal energy systems and in highly glazed buildings. In solar thermal collectors. the elevated temperatures occurring during stagnation result in reduced lifetime of the collector materials. Highly glazed building facades provide high solar gains in winter. but imply in most cases high energy needs for air conditioning in summer. The aim of this thesis is to propose” smart” thermochromic coatings as a solution to such problems. A durable inorganic thermochromic material is vanadium dioxide. At 68 C. VO2 undergoes a reversible crystal structural phase transition accompanied by a strong change in optical properties. By doping the material with tungsten. it is possible to lower the transition temperature. making it suitable as a window coating. Controlled doping of VO2 based films was possible using a co-sputtering installation. This doping lowered the transition temperature from 67.9±0.5 C to 49.5±0.5 C. In order to simulate the optical behavior of multilayered solar coatings. precise knowledge of the optical properties of the material is required. In this study the complex dielectric functions of VO2 and VO2: W were determined by spectroscopic UV-VIS-NIR-MIR ellipsometry above and below the transition temperature. For this purpose. a point-by-point analysis of the ellipsometric angles Ψ/∆ was performed. A validation of our results was obtained comparing the optical constants determined by point-by-point fitting with those determined by the Lorentz-Drude and the empirical Lorentz-Cauchy dispersion formula.

This paper proposes a methodology to assess the elements of strategic. tactical and supplementary capabilities. all of which together constitute the technological capability of a firm. In addition. the methodology includes the assessment of the steering capability of the firm in its analytical framework. The proposed methodology comprises five steps: identification of value addition stages performed by a firm; determination of technological capabilities needed at these stages; development of indicators for assessing the identified technological capabilities; benchmarking the capabilities assessed with a state-of-the-art firm; and analysis of the reasons for the technological capability gap between the firm being studied and the state-of-the-art firm.The development of the indicators is …,True,PsSuNSoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,150,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166497297828969,2195628533602026106,/scholar?cites=2195628533602026106,,,,0,0,0

One such aspect is the evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses with respect to a firm's technological capability. Existing methodologies for technological capability assessment tend to be very general and do not focus on critical elements that constitute the technological capability of a firm.This paper suggests a comprehensive methodology and illustrates it through case studies of two firms in the electricity utility sector. namely the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and Electricité de France (EDF). The two case studies. based on the proposed methodology. show how the technological capability profile of both these firms can be developed and draw attention not only to areas of strength but also to those that are weak and need improvement.

1317212,The role of technological capability in value addition: The case of the electricity sector,1995,H Panda and K Ramanathan,2,Technology Management,2,84-100,,The value addition activities in a firm can be broadly covered under two distinct stages. called the strategic value addition stage and the tactical value addition stage.  The former covers creation. design and engineering. and construction activities. which are more of a long-term core competence building nature. while the latter includes production. marketing and selling. and service activities. which mainly emphasize effective implementation of current business activities.  The unique nature of activities in each stage. their dynamic characteristics. and the temporal occurrence of the value addition stage in the product's life call for specific technological capabilities at each stage at an appropriate level. In this article six functional and two supplementary technological capabilities have been proposed.  Each of the functional technological capabilities corresponds to a specific strategic and tactical value addition activity.  In contrast. supplementary technological capabilities are essential in every value addition stage and enhance the effectiveness of functional capabilities.  Finally. a steering capability. which is managerial in nature and not technological. is included to emphasize the fact that without it technological capabilities cannot be effectively deployed and upgraded.  To be in business. a firm must have steering capability. supplementary technological capability. and at least one of the functional technological capabilities.  In this article a methodology has been suggested to identify the technological capability needs for various value addition activities.

1317217,Energy scenario in India,2011,Haribandhu Panda,,KERALA ENVIRONMENT CONGRESS 2011,,29,,India’s per capita energy and electricity consumptions are less than one tenth of developed countries’ per capita consumption. The disparities in urban vs rural; southern. western and northern region vs eastern and north-eastern region; and higher income vs lower income households are very high. Unfortunately. the regions where large fossil and renewable energy sources are available have lower per capita energy consumption. For sustainable and equitable socio-economic development such a situation needs to change.Given the country’s over dependence on coal. large scale import of oil and gas. difficulty in meeting the financial burden of import. environmental consequences of large scale energy production. transformation. transportation and use. it is not wise to strive to achieve the developed country level of energy consumption. To improve the quality of life of Indian citizens. there is no doubt that per capita energy consumption has to increase. Through judicious approach. higher quality of life can be achieved with moderate increase in energy consumption. The country needs to make timely change of our emphasis on non-renewable energy. Such a change in strategy calls for a paradigm shift in our development approach. ie from an unsustainable growth oriented economic development to an environmental friendly equitable development. Since three most serious environment related problems (global warming. acid rain and ozone layer depletion) owe their origin to energy. it is in our national and global interest that we minimise ‘energy want’without sacrificing the ‘energy need’for a decent quality of life.

The purpose of the present study is to bridge the gap that exists in the literature through the development of a methodology to assess the effectiveness of inter-organisational linkages that supports innovation. For this. the concept of technology systems structure for comprehensive management of technology at the national level. industry level and organisation level has been discussed.,True,PsSuNSoAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1807327331814637247&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

The collapse of public education system. both at school and university level. results not only creation of socio-economically inappropriate manpower. but also ever-corroding foundation over which it is not easy to establish a healthy society. Increasing dependence on the private health system for perceptible high-quality service is adding further misery to the large segment of the population belonging to middle class and those below. Extraction based economic development. associated environmental degradation and job-less growth. and declining agriculture and allied sector result in distress migration of people. The situation is aggravated by the populist measures of political parties and recurrent natural calamities in the form of cyclone. flood. drought and heat wave and absence of climate resilient long term strategies of effective management of forest. water. land. minerals through right type of local value addition and local market creation. There is an urgent need for socio-political empowerment of excluded (scheduled tribes. scheduled castes. other backward castes. women. disabled. landless and slum dwellers) for realising their right to high quality education; health; and sustainable and dignified livelihood security through appropriate technology introduction. market intervention. large scale employability and entrepreneurship development. ownership and access to land and other natural resources and public institutions.,True,PsSuNSoAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/62409433/Development_Challenges_and_Prospects_Odisha_Centurion_Journal_12_Feb_201720200319-87334-qpqw0d.pdf,,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/62409433/Development_Challenges_and_Prospects_Odisha_Centurion_Journal_12_Feb_201720200319-87334-qpqw0d.pdf,0,0,0
1317227,ENERGY SECURITY OF ODISHA: ROLE OF FORESTS,,Haribandhu Panda,,,,,,Life is not possible without energy. All living beings. human included. require energy for their survival. growth and reproduction. Energy used can be broadly divided into commercial and noncommercial form. Commercial energy. ie traded in the market. includes coal. oil. gas. electricity and in some cases biomass. Noncommercial energy includes mostly biomass that is used for cooking. predominantly by the rural communities. Accurate and more recent data on noncommercial energy use in the country is not available. In 2000. India's energy mix was 65% commercial and 35% noncommercial (TEDDY 2010. pp 2). The commercial energy consumption in India is highly dependent on coal. It contributes to about 53% in 2008 09. In the same year. the contribution of oil and gas were respectively 33% and 8%. Balance is from nuclear. hydro and other renewable energy sources. 156 million ton of oil was consumed in the country in 2007 08. 75% of oil consumption was imported which accounted for 23.4% of total import bill and 6.3% of GDP of the country. Bulk of it is used in the transport sector. According to the Dy Chairman. Planning Commission (2006). the present energy scenario in India is not satisfactory primarily because of our heavy dependence on imported oil and the volatility of international oil price. Achieving energy security of the country has been our strategic goal.Considering the natural resource diversity of the country. national level energy security can be better achieved if region specific energy plan is developed. National energy security can be built up from bottom. ie by achieving local and state level energy security.

We observed higher rates of hydrogen evolution with the increase of the {101} facets presence. owing to their reductive nature. This helps the Pt photodeposition in the early stages of irradiation and. then. the hydrogen ion reduction reaction.

Despite decades of intensive work on this topic. the efficiency of the water photolytic process under irradiated semiconductors is far from reaching significant photocatalytic efficiency. The use of a sacrificial agent as hole scavenger dramatically increases the hydrogen production rate and might represent the classic “kill two birds with one stone”: on the one hand. the production of hydrogen. then usable as energy carrier. on the other. the treatment of water for the abatement of pollutants used as sacrificial agents. Among metal oxides. TiO 2 has a central role due to its versatility and inexpensiveness that allows an extended applicability in several scientific and technological fields.

The increase of their concentration to detectable values is the consequence of the inability of the Conventional Waste Water Plants (CWWPs) to abate these products. We subjected 1H-benzotriazole (BTz). tolyltriazole (TTz). and Tinuvin P (TP. a common UV plastic stabilizer) to photocatalytic degradation under UV-irradiated TiO 2 in different conditions. The principal photoformed intermediates. the relationship between the degradation rate and the pH. the degree of mineralization. and the fate of the organic nitrogen were investigated. Under the adopted experimental conditions. all the studied substrates were rapidly photocatalytically transformed (the maximum degradation rates for BTz and TTz were (3.88±0.05)× 10− 2 and (2.11±0.09)× 10− 2 mM min− 1. respectively) and mineralized (the mineralization rate for BTz and TTz was 4.0× 10− 3 mM C min− 1 for both substrates).

However. this process is viable only if the iron oxide can be cycled between the fully-oxidised and fully-reduced states many times.

If the OC is Fe2O3. the oxidation can take place in steam to produce hydrogen. i.e. chemical looping hydrogen production (CLH). This paper presents an investigation of CaO modified Fe2O3 OCs for CLC and CLH. The performance of the mechanically mixed OCs were examined in a thermogravimetric analyser and a fluidised bed.

For the conversion of potato peel into liquid biofuel. the PPW assessed as received and physico-chemical characterization were carried out. Here. pyrolysis process was performed in a fixed bed horizontal pyrolyzer and the effect of reaction time and temperature on product distribution during pyrolysis and the physio-chemical properties of the produced bio-oil were investigated. The maximum bio-oil yield from PPWs was 32.15 wt.% at 450 oC and maintaining 45 min reaction time. Besides bio-oil. non-condensable gases (26.68 wt.%) and bio-char (41.18 wt.%. a porous carbonaceous material) were produced during pyrolysis. Bio-oil produced from PPWs was characterized by various physico-chemical analyses. The fractionation of produced bio-oil gives 68 wt.% medium distillates (80–100oC). 21 wt.% light distillates (below 80oC fraction) and 11 wt.% residue (heavy fraction; above 100 oC).

The tools for turbulence characterization include Doppler reflectometry (DR) and radial correlation Doppler reflectometry (RCDR)[1]. latter of which utilizes simultaneous probing with two microwaves at different frequencies incident obliquely onto magnetic surface in the presence of the cutoff. As it was shown in [2. 3]. at a large enough incidence angle by performing correlation analysis of backscattering signals. the information about turbulence properties can be extracted.However. for both RCDR and conventional DR. analytical theory only predicts direct relation of measured quantities to turbulence characteristics in the linear regime of scattering [3]. corresponding to low turbulence amplitudes. Some analytical results for nonlinear regime. such as criteria for the onset on nonlinearity [4. 5] and for transition to fully nonlinear regime corresponding to a saturation of the scattering signal power growth with the turbulence level were obtained for radial correlation reflectometry [6. 7] and for DR [8]. Nevertheless. the interpretation of experimental DR measurements is challenging in the nonlinear regime and in transition to it. Moreover. even for the linear scattering regime substantial contribution of the small-angle scattering off long-scale fluctuations in the scattering signal leads to the overestimation of radial correlation length [3. 7. 9].

According to the present day understanding [1. 2] the anomalous transport is determined by the multi-scale drift-wave turbulence and the nonlinear interaction of its components. The gyrokinetic (GK) simulations [3. 4] provide an efficient tool for studying the nonlinear turbulent plasma dynamics and in the recent papers [5. 6] such simulations of the electron and ion distribution functions from the first principles were performed for the small research limiter tokamak FT-2. The interplay of the multi-scale turbulence components was studied and successful quantitative comparison was presented with O-mode Doppler reflectometry (DR) and enhanced microwave scattering in the upper hybrid resonance [5. 6]. Unfortunately. the interpretation of DR data is complicated due to the contribution of the poorly localized small-angle scattering. which can lead to the overestimation of the turbulence radial correlation length in the linear scattering regime [7. 8]. and to its underestimation in the strongly nonlinear regime [9]. In the latter case the turbulence wavenumber spectrum measurements are questionable. and only the plasma turbulence mean velocity could be determined [10]. Moreover the 2D propagation effects additionally complicate the experimental data interpretation and its comparison with the theory predictions.

In the ""fast"" version DR signal is computed in the linear theory approximation using the reciprocity theorem utilizing the probing wave field pattern provided by computation taking into account the 2D plasma inhomogeneity effects. whereas the alternative ""slow"" version of DR synthetic diagnostic is based on the full-wave code IPF-FD3D describing the probing and scattered wave propagation in turbulent plasma. The DR signal frequency spectra and the dependence of their frequency shift. width and shape on the probing antenna position are computed and shown to be similar to those measured in the high field side probing DR experiment at the FT-2 tokamak. The GAM characteristics provided by the measurements and by the synthetic DR are close within a 12% accuracy. However the variation of the DR signal at growing incidence angles in experiment is slower than predicted by both synthetic diagnostics. The substantial difference was found also in the decay of the DR signal CCFs with growing frequency shift in the probing wave channels. The quick decrease of the RCDR coherence observed in the experiment and full-wave synthetic diagnostic compared to the fast synthetic RCDR is attributed to the phase modulation of the probing wave in the former two cases due to the long-scale density fluctuations. which is shown to be close to π/4 both in the specially performed measurements and in the GK modelling.

For heavier isotopes it reduces. firstly. the plasma anomalous diffusivity and. secondly.-the power threshold for the LH transition [1]. Both effects are crucial for fusion applications of the tokamak plasma confinement scheme. In the present paper we study interplay of these effects in the FT-2 tokamak high density ohmic discharges. Detailed study of general transport properties of the FT-2 tokamak [2] showed similar behavior of energy confinement for hydrogen (H) and deuterium (D) ohmic plasmas at densities up to< ne>≈ 4· 10 19 m-3. However some signs of essential difference in τE behavior for different isotopes were discovered at higher densities. To confirm this isotopic discrepancy special series of ohmic discharges were performed in H and D plasmas within the chord averaged density range< ne>≈(5–9)· 10 19 m-3. In this paper we present the results of energy confinement study in these high density regimes (HDR). Improvement of confinement with growing density is observed in D-discharges in contradiction to well known LOC to SOC transition observed at the same densities in H-plasma. At the same time clear signs of improved confinement transition effect are seen for D-discharges including the turbulence suppression at the edge provided by Langmuir probes.,True,yQXB-M8AAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC,0,http://ocs.ciemat.es/EPS2018PAP/pdf/P4.1097.pdf,,,,,http://ocs.ciemat.es/EPS2018PAP/pdf/P4.1097.pdf,0,0,0

The proposed algorithm. while tested on an ASHP. is essentially decoupled from the heating mechanism making it sufficiently robust to generalize to other types of heating mechanisms as well.

At its peak. this amounted to over a 7 GW supply-demand gap and caused the electricity grid to be offline for vast swathes of population for many hours daily. Despite major supply-side investments acute shortages persist and a large percentage of relatively affluent households. estimated in millions. have countered this by investing in self-generation and battery storage technologies (usually lead-acid batteries because of their low cost). This paper summarizes the impact of this backup technology on the broader energy system in terms of efficiency losses for households and contribution to low-voltage grid congestion.

Historically. this has been treated as a local. or single-agent. optimization problem. However. many buildings utilize the same types of thermal equipment eg electric heaters and hot water vessels. During operation. occupants in these buildings interact with the equipment differently thereby driving them to diverse regions in the state-space. Reinforcement learning agents can learn from these interactions. recorded as sensor data. to optimize the overall energy efficiency. However. if these agents operate individually at a household level. they can not exploit the replicated structure in the problem. In this paper. we demonstrate that this problem can indeed benefit from multi-agent collaboration by making use of targeted exploration of the state-space allowing for better generalization. We also investigate trade-offs between integrating human knowledge and additional sensors. Results show that savings of over 40% are possible with collaborative multi-agent systems making use of either expert knowledge or additional sensors with no loss of occupant comfort.

For design and operational optimization. they are usually either modelled by domain experts or through black-box models which makes use of sensor data. However. given the wide variability in hot water systems. it is impractical for a domain expert to individually model every hot water system.

Using real world data from 61 houses employing two different types of hot water systems. the proposed system is shown to work on both homogeneous and heterogeneous hot water systems.

The lack of a clear international framework for the requirements and properties of energy Flexible Buildings leads to numerous definitions that are being developed in parallel and are applied to specific cases when evaluating and/or quantifying energy flexibility. Although the concept of energy flexibility of buildings is relatively simple to understand. its application in reality can be complex and difficult to explain in simple terms. This complexity is not helped by the myriad of ways in which energy flexibility can be achieved or the wide range of stakeholders involved; especially when many stakeholders have very little understanding. or interest. in the supply and demand of energy in buildings.,True,qmCgNL0AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,1,https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/principles-of-energy-flexible-buildings-energy-in-buildings-and-c,1861000791445500934,/scholar?cites=1861000791445500934,,,https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/principles-of-energy-flexible-buildings-energy-in-buildings-and-c,0,0,0

Africa. and Latin America. The relatively affluent in these countries circumvent the problem by installing grid-connected backup systems. which provide uninterrupted supply. However. these backup systems increase losses and burden the local electricity grid. For instance. estimates show that in Pakistan. between 2% - 3% of annual energy generation is lost through battery charging. In addition. due to these elite backup systems. over 10% of all distribution transformers are overloaded. This overload causes needless expenditure that developing countries can not afford. as well as greenhouse gas emissions which accelerate climate change.

1317331,Data-driven Modelling and Control of Energy Flexible Residential Loads,2019,Hussain Kazmi,,,,,,Burning fossil fuels to meet humanity's insatiable energy demand is one of the leading drivers for anthropogenic climate change. An important means of mitigating the worst impact of climate change is therefore improving efficiency of current energy use and transitioning to a cleaner energy mix to meet the residual demand. This requires a fundamental rethink of how the energy value-chain is organized at present. A key technology to enable the sustainability transition is through employing demand side management to leverage flexibility at multiple scales. Demand side management encompasses both demand reduction and demand response of controllable or flexible loads via automatic control or user engagement. Notable examples of flexible loads at the residential building level-which forms the focus of this thesis-include electric batteries. and thermostatically controllable loads such as hot water systems. Unlike electric batteries. modelling and controlling thermostatically controllable loads (such as electric heaters. heat pumps etc.) poses a more challenging problem. However. they make up for a substantial fraction of energy demand in many European countries. and can provide energy flexibility at a far cheaper price point than electric storage. Controlling thermostatically controllable loads is hard because of the general non-existence of a model which can be used to describe their behaviour. This model is necessary to control the load in a way which is beneficial for both the user and the grid. In its absence. naive rule-based controllers are frequently employed which perform demonstrably sub-optimally. Historically. this modelling step has …,True,qmCgNL0AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,0,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/2790430?limo=0,,,,,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/541161,0,0,0
1317332,Developing synergies for automated optimal control of residential heat pumps,2017,Hussain Syed Kazmi and Cheaib Farah and Driesen Johan,,,,,,Energy efficiency in the built environment has been identified as one of the key enabling technologies to meet global climate change targets. In this paper. we present promising results from a black box method to automatically characterize various aspects of heat pump operation in residential settings. Experimental data is gathered from heat pumps used to provide spatial heating and domestic hot water in recently refurbished net-zero energy houses. This is done by data-driven determination of the heat pump’s performance and the impact of building occupants. These interactions. typically in the form of hot water consumption profiles and preferences for temperature set points. are learnt from sensor data. This allows the formulation of an explicit Markov Decision Process (MDP). which can be solved with the objective to maximize energy efficiency of local heat pump operation. In doing so. we show substantial gains over default policies (grounded in thermodynamics) but which don’t consider occupant behaviour. Three key short-term benefits are envisaged from this research: first. leveraging such synergies allows the energy efficiency of heat pump operation to be improved by. on average. more than 10%. Second. automation unlocks the potential to circumvent the costly. non-generalizable model building step in model predictive control. Finally. it allows direct. unbiased benchmarking of theoretical performance of different types of heat pumps against real world performance.,True,qmCgNL0AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/1928521?limo=0,,,,,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/485343,0,0,0

1317365,Optimization of the operation of smart rural grids through a novel energy management system,2018,Francesc Girbau-LListuella and Francisco Díaz-González and Andreas Sumper,11,Energies,1,9,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The paper proposes an innovative Energy Management System (EMS) that optimizes the grid operation based on economic and technical criteria. The EMS inputs the demand and renewable generation forecasts. electricity prices and the status of the distributed storages through the network. and solves with an optimal quarter-hourly dispatch for controllable resources. The performance of the EMS is quantified through diverse proposed metrics. The analyses were based on a real rural grid from the European FP7 project Smart Rural Grid. The performance of the EMS has been evaluated through some scenarios varying the penetration of distributed generation. The obtained results demonstrate that the inclusion of the EMS from both a technical point of view and an economic perspective for the adopted grid is justified. At the technical level. the inclusion of the EMS permits us to significantly increase the power quality in weak and radial networks. At the economic level and from a certain threshold value in renewables’ penetration. the EMS reduces the energy costs for the grid participants. minimizing imports from the external grid and compensating the toll to be paid in the form of the losses incurred by including additional equipment in the network (ie. distributed storage).

1317367,Smart grids for rural conditions and e-mobility-applying power routers. batteries and virtual power plants,2016,Volker Boehner and P Franz and J Hanson and R Gallart and S Martínez and Andreas Sumper and Francesc Girbau Llistuella,,,,1-9,,Significant reductions of greenhouse gas emission by use of renewable energy sources belong to the common targets of the European Union. Smart grids address intelligent use and integration of conventional and renewable generation in combination with controllable loads and storages. Two special aspects have also to be considered for smart grids in future: rural conditions and electric vehicles. Both. the increasing share of renewable energy sources and a rising demand for charging power by electrical vehicles lead to new challenges of network stability (congestion. voltage deviation). especially in rural distribution grids. This paper describes two lighthouse projects in Europe (“Well2Wheel” and “Smart Rural Grid”) dealing with these topics. The link between these projects is the implementation of the same virtual power plant technology and the approach of cellular grid cells. Starting with an approach for the average energy balance in 15 minutes intervals in several grid cells in the first project. the second project even allows the islanded operation of such cells as a microgrid. The integration of renewable energy sources into distribution grids primary takes place in rural areas. The lighthouse project “Smart Rural Grid”. which is founded by the European Union. demonstrates possibilities to use the existing distribution system operator infrastructure more effectively by applying an optimised and scheduled operation of the assets and using intelligent distribution power routers. called IDPR.

In the CPV market. photovoltaic systems with four cells are needed to make CPV more cost competitive. This is because systems with four cells have more yield than the existing three cell systems. Technically. making a stack of four cells imposes constrains on the choice of the materials (ie energy bandgap and lattice constant) and it involves complex and costly fabrication techniques. This paper suggests a design of a CPV system with two separate double-junction solar cells (ie four PV cells). The system proposed enables the operation of the four cells independently. It also offers high flexibility in the choice of the materials for making the solar cells.

Furthermore. these devices are designed to operate under high concentration. and this results in having them functioning at high temperatures.

The bed-to-wall heat transfer is determined from the radial temperature distribution in the wall. The CO2 content of the fluidizing gas is changed by either adding varying amounts of CO2 to the air or by burning coal and coke with and without an addition of limestone. The heat transfer coefficient increases with both system pressure and bed temperature due to increased contribution of gas convection and radiation. The heat transfer coefficient also increases with CO2 concentration due to increased non-luminous radiation from CO2.,True,YrcFxswAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931000002933,7394078811281106515,/scholar?cites=7394078811281106515,,,,0,0,0

The TiO 2 HFs were prepared by co-axial electrospinning and used as the light-scattering layer in the DSSC. The thickness variations of the TiO 2 NP and Zn-doped TiO 2 HF photoanode layers affect the performance of the DSSC. especially the short-circuit photocurrent density. The thickness of the TiO 2 NP layer significantly affected the absorbance of photons and N719 dye molecules in the double-layer photoanode. while that of the Zn-doped TiO 2 HF layer affected the scattering of light. as indicated by the low light transmittance in the photoanode. Conventional DSSCs consist of single-layer photoanodes. and exhibit relatively low efficiency. ie. 1.293% and 0.89% for TiO 2 NP and Zn-doped TiO 2 HF. respectively.

This study uses numerical and experimental analyses to investigate the reduction in the operating temperature of PV panels with an air-cooled heat sink. The proposed heat sink was designed as an aluminum plate with perforated fins that is attached to the back of the PV panel. A comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was conducted using the software ANSYS Fluent to ensure that the heat sink model worked properly. The influence of heat sinks on the heat transfer between a PV panel and the circulating ambient air was investigated. The results showed a substantial decrease in the operating temperature of the PV panel and an increase in its electrical performance. The CFD analysis in the heat sink model with an air flow velocity of 1.5 m/s and temperature of 35°C under a heat flux of 1000 W/m2 showed a decrease in the PV panel’s average temperature from 85.3°C to 72.8°C. As a consequence of decreasing its temperature. the heat sink increased the open-circuit photovoltage () and maximum power point () of the PV panel by 10% and 18.67%. respectively. Therefore. the use of aluminum heat sinks could provide a potential solution to prevent PV panels from overheating and may indirectly lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions due to the increased electricity production from the PV system.,True,OBUM3JcAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC,14,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/1574274/,11063058355765537488,/scholar?cites=11063058355765537488,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/1574274/,0,0,0

Although training programs have become routine activities provided by the government every year and inmates are trained in various skills in preparation for their after-free. some still choose to return to the criminal world. Empirical studies show that there are two main causes. namely (1) the training program is given to make them skilled workers that after they acquire freedom no company will hire former prisoners.(2) there are constraints such as capital and knowledge emerge as for those starting and running a business. A new approach is necessary for construction problems. This study attempts to test the model of human resource development for former prisoners to prepare them for entrepreneurship.

The exterior coating material is arranged in slabs separated by open joints that enable exterior air to enter and leave the cavity all along the wall. Under radiation conditions (and negligible wind velocity) the natural thermal convection produces a chimney effect that forces external air to circulate along the air cavity at an unknown rate. As a consequence of this mass exchange through the openings. the heat transfer problem turns more complex: air motion and thermal field are strongly coupled and therefore highly dependent on geometric characteristics of the wall.

This paper aims to compare the impact of climate change on the energy performance of residential buildings in order to derive potential design strategies. Different climate file inputs of Madrid have been used to quantify comparatively the thermal needs of two reference residential buildings located in this city. One of them represents buildings older than 40 years built according to the applicable Spanish regulations prior to 1979. The other refers to buildings erected in the last decade under more energy-restrictive constructive regulations. Three different climate databases of Madrid have been used to assess the impact of the evolution of the climate in recent years on the thermal demands of these two reference buildings. Two of them are typical meteorological years (TMY) derived from weather data measured before 2000. On the contrary. the third one is an experimental file representing the average values of the meteorological variables registered in Madrid during the last decade. Annual and monthly comparisons are done between the three climate databases assessing the climate changes. Compared to the TMYs databases. the experimental one records an average air temperature of 1.8 C higher and an average value of relative humidity that is 9% lower.

It has been claimed that these components help to reduce energy use in buildings and improve occupant comfort. However. their performance strongly depends on the airflow passing through the cavity. In order to characterise and to model the behaviour of the ventilation and its effectiveness. the components need to be tested in the laboratory. as well as under real dynamic weather conditions. Despite the steadily growing research in this area. there are few studies with conclusive results about the reliability of existing experimental procedures for characterisation of airflow in the ventilated cavities.

A laboratory model of a ventilated façade with horizontal and vertical open joints was used to study thermal and fluid-dynamic behaviour of this system. Experimental Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (Stereo-PIV 2D-3C) was applied to study the fluid dynamic performance of this model. In addition. thermal analyses were performed applying infrared thermography and air temperature monitoring inside the ventilated cavity. Experimental measurements were carried out inside the air cavity in a vertical joint plane and in a middle plane of panels. corresponding to horizontal joints. Radiation condition corresponds to 1x109 Ra and wind effect is not considered. The analysis of the data confirms previous results of velocity and temperature patterns for OJVF with horizontal joints and leads to identify two different velocity patterns corresponding to the airflow entrance through horizontal and vertical joints.

However. the extremely poor cycling stability caused by the huge volume change during charge/discharge prevents it from the commercial use. In this work. we propose a strategy to decrease the intrinsic volume change of bulk Si-based anodes by preinsertion Li into Si with a chemical reaction. Amorphous Li12Si7 was successfully synthesized by a hydrogen-driven reaction between LiH and Si associated with subsequent energetic ball milling. The as-prepared amorphous Li12Si7 anode exhibits significantly improved lithium storage ability as ∼70.7% of the initial charge capacity is retained after 20 cycles.

The results indicate that Mg2Si prepared by isothermal dehydrogenation at 310 and 330 °C exhibit better cycling stability than the samples prepared at 290 and 350 °C due to the joint effects of the product purity and the particle size. especially for the 330 °C-prepared sample.

In particular. significant efforts have been made in recent years with metal amide-hydride combined systems since Chen et al. reported that lithium nitride. Li3N could absorb/desorb reversibly 11.4 mass% of hydrogen in 2002. 11) A variety of metal amide-hydride combinations have been designed and developed for their hydrogen storage performances. 11–15) However. most of them still suffer from the high operating temperature for practical applications.

One of the important applications of this type of hybrid system is to use them in UAV propulsion systems and in airliners as an APU. The main purpose of this research is design of a hybrid APU equipped with solid oxide fuel cell which would be one of the basic requirements for electric power generation in larger aircrafts in the future. Design parameters and decision-making variables in analysis of this system are the compressor pressure ratio. gas temperatures entrance to turbine and the number of selected cells. The results show that the system’s increasing pressure causes decrease in the temperature of outlet gases from the turbine and the cell’s operating temperature; and this problem severely affects the productivity and efficiency of the electrical system. At 1000 C. for entrance gases to the turbine. electrical efficiency of system is about 49 percent. Also. the maximum electrical efficiency of the system in fuel cell is estimated to be about 55 percent.

Compressible and supersonic gas flow inside a Double Throat nozzle and its exhaust plume at specific nozzle pressure ratios have been numerically studied with several turbulence models. Numerical results reveal that. the SST k–ω model gave the best results compared with the other models in time and accuracy.

1317574,Road transport vehicles in South Africa towards 2050: Factors influencing technology choice and implications for fuel supply,2018,Fadiel Ahjum and Bruno Merven and Adrian Stone and Tara Caetano,29,Journal of Energy in Southern Africa,3,33-50,University of Cape Town,The South African transport sector is estimated to emit 60 MtCO 2 eq and require 800 PJ of energy. similar in scale to industrial energy demand and emissions. The sector is forecast to potentially eclipse industry in this regard if conventional vehicle choices and travel modes persist. This paper explores scenarios of transport technology choices and demand in a future of uncertain fuel and technology costs. and the consequences for energy supply and greenhouse gas emissions. It explores the extent of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and the implication of fuel migration from petroleum products. The preference for alternative fuels such as hydrogen. liquid biofuels and natural gas is also investigated. The evolution of road transport in South Africa towards 2050 is investigated utilising the South African TIMES model. a full energy sector least-cost optimisation model that relies on a rich technological database of the entire energy supply and demand system. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are shown to be a viable option in freight and public transport. potentially meeting 70% of travel demand by 2045. The private passenger and light commercial sectors emerge as the main market for electric vehicles. potentially accounting for 80% of new vehicle sales by 2045. Electricity as a transport fuel could account for 30% of fuel supply and reduce transport emissions to half of present day estimates. However. the key uncertainty driving EV adoption is future vehicle costs and crude oil prices. which could dampen EV uptake. Another main finding is that petroleum-dependent vehicles remain an important vehicle class. and that re-investment in existing crude oil …,True,Xc5EgpoAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,11,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S1021-447X2018000300004&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es,866980232798515960,/scholar?cites=866980232798515960,,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S1021-447X2018000300004&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es,0,0,0

IEA. 2014; Citi. 2015). Stranded assets are defined as assets that “have suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs. devaluations or conversion to liabilities”(Caldecott et al. 2014). This can arise from environmental regulation or other regulatory shifts. market forces. and other causes. including the falling costs of competing technologies.Much of the research on stranded assets thus far has examined the potential financial risks to investors of stranding fossil fuel assets and wasted exploration and extraction capex (Carbon Tracker Initiative. 2011. 2013. 2015; Caldecott et al 2014). For example. McGlade & Ekins (2015) estimated that a third of oil. half of gas and over 80% of coal reserves cannot be burned in future emission scenarios consistent with limiting temperature rise to below 2oC. Policy interventions to limit warming have been estimated to result in $100 trillion worth of stranded fossil fuel resources to 2050 (Citibank 2015). On the production side. potential wasted capex on fossil fuel projects that exceed the fossil energy requirements for scenarios consistent with 2oC is in the order of $1.9-2.2 trillion. including an estimated $8.6 bn in coal mining capital expenditure in South Africa (CTI. 2015).,True,Xc5EgpoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,10,https://www.africaportal.org/publications/the-impact-of-stranding-power-sector-assets-in-south-africa-using-a-linked-model-to-understand-economy-wide-implications/,2485332761660599889,/scholar?cites=2485332761660599889,,,https://www.africaportal.org/documents/15384/2016-Burtonetal-Impact_stranding_power_sector_assets.pdf,0,0,0

1317580,Decarbonisation and the transport sector: A socio-economic analysis of transport sector futures in South Africa,2017,Tara Caetano and Bruno Merven and Faaiqa Hartley and Fadiel Ahjum,28,Journal of Energy in Southern Africa,4,9-18,Energy Research Centre,Globally. governments are investigating transport solutions that not only reduce their national emissions but also decrease their reliance on energy imports and increase clean air in cities and towns. A transition in the transport sector is seemingly inevitable considering these priorities. This study outlines some key socio-economic implications of a transition in South Africa's transport system. building on work previously done. The focus was on a rapid decarbonisation of the South African economy and the potential impacts of implementing efficiency improvements in the transport sector. including mode-switching. The overall finding was that a more ambitious decarbonisation target would have marginal impact on the economy relative to South Africa's nationally-determined contribution. It was further found that the implementation of efficiency improvements and changes in behaviour (decreased mileage. increased occupancy. increased rail use and increased use of public transport) could significantly reduce the burden on the economy of a higher GHG emission reduction target.,True,Xc5EgpoAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,4,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2017000400002,13821882956394306572,/scholar?cites=13821882956394306572,,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2017000400002,0,0,0
1317581,Energy system and economy-wide implications of a rapid transition to decarbonized energy in South Africa,2017,Tara Caetano and Bruno Merven,,,2017/39,,WIDER Working Paper,Developed as well as developing countries will have to increase their ambition relative to their stated Nationally Determined Contributions to limit global temperature increases to 2êC above pre-industrial levels. South Africa's Nationally Determined Contribution. in line with national policy. is to follow a peak. plateau. and decline emissions trajectory to 2050. with the contribution post-2030 contingent on a fair contribution from other countries. Given the high levels of unemployment. poverty. and inequality in South Africa. there are concerns that a rapid transition to a low-carbon energy system would have severe socioeconomic consequences. This paper builds on initial work from the Deep Decarbonisation Pathways Project. and analyses the impacts on the energy system and the economy of an increase in ambition. in order to shed light on these concerns. The key policy recommendation from this analysis is that further investments in fossil fuel infrastructure in South Africa will have significant negative socioeconomic implications. and that further work should be done to reassess development pathways that could mitigate these negative impacts.,True,Xc5EgpoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,3,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/161607,14381248812639443332,/scholar?cites=14381248812639443332,,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/161607/1/880885564.pdf,0,0,0

1317583,The socio-economic implications of renewable energy and low-carbon trajectories in South Africa,2014,Tara Caetanoa and James Thurlowb,,Internalising mitigation activities into the development priorities and approaches of developing countries,,90,,South Africa is one of the top twenty emitters in the world and. like many middle-income countries. is facing the challenge of pursuing low-carbon policies in the context of high levels of unemployment. inequality and poverty. Renewable energy investments and the implementation of a carbon tax are two key issues on the low-carbon policy agenda for South Africa. This paper uses a dynamic-recursive general equilibrium model to evaluate the potential implications of these mitigation actions for economic growth. emissions. employment and inequality in South Africa. Results indicate that both the implementation of a carbon tax and investment in greener energy options are unlikely to have a ‘devastating’impact on the economy. The introduction of renewable energy has a positive impact on direct employment in the electricity sector. although indirect job losses. mostly by low-skilled workers. drown out this effect and lead to a slight decrease in overall employment growth and a negative impact on income distribution. This study finds that the introduction of a carbon tax is an effective mechanism for emissions reduction. The proposed tax-level. however. even coupled with an aggressive renewable energy build plan. is still too low to allow South Africa to reach its emissions reduction target of 42% by 2025. If South Africa is to meet the challenge of decreasing emissions as well as decreasing inequality and eradicating poverty a higher carbon tax should be introduced. along with a revenue-recycling mechanism that would result in increased welfare.,True,Xc5EgpoAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Tyler3/publication/270885643_Internalising_mitigation_activities_into_the_development_priorities_and_approaches_of_developing_countries_Proceedings_of_the_Forum_on_Development_and_Mitigation_Cape_Town_2014_Cape_Town_Energy_Resear/links/58388e5f08ae3a74b49d1a7d/Internalising-mitigation-activities-into-the-development-priorities-and-approaches-of-developing-countries-Proceedings-of-the-Forum-on-Development-and-Mitigation-Cape-Town-2014-Cape-Town-Energy-Resea.pdf#page=100,11860792137058905636,/scholar?cites=11860792137058905636,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Tyler3/publication/270885643_Internalising_mitigation_activities_into_the_development_priorities_and_approaches_of_developing_countries_Proceedings_of_the_Forum_on_Development_and_Mitigation_Cape_Town_2014_Cape_Town_Energy_Resear/links/58388e5f08ae3a74b49d1a7d/Internalising-mitigation-activities-into-the-development-priorities-and-approaches-of-developing-countries-Proceedings-of-the-Forum-on-Development-and-Mitigation-Cape-Town-2014-Cape-Town-Energy-Resea.pdf#page=100,0,0,0

IEA. 2014; Citi. 2015). Stranded assets are defined as assets that “have suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs. devaluations or conversion to liabilities”(Caldecott et al. 2014). This can arise from environmental regulation or other regulatory shifts. market forces. and other causes. including the falling costs of competing technologies.Much of the research on stranded assets thus far has examined the potential financial risks to investors of stranding fossil fuel assets and wasted exploration and extraction capex (Carbon Tracker Initiative. 2011. 2013. 2015; Caldecott et al 2014). For example. McGlade & Ekins (2015) estimated that a third of oil. half of gas and over 80% of coal reserves cannot be burned in future emission scenarios consistent with limiting temperature rise to below 2​ o​ C. Policy interventions to limit warming have been estimated to result in $100 trillion worth of stranded fossil fuel resources to 2050 (Citibank 2015). On the production side. potential wasted capex on fossil fuel projects that exceed the fossil energy requirements for scenarios consistent with 2​ o​ C is in the order of $1.9-2.2 trillion. including an estimated $8.6 bn in coal mining capital expenditure in South Africa (CTI. 2015).,True,Xc5EgpoAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,https://zivahub.uct.ac.za/articles/journal_contribution/MAPS_SA_-_Reports/7239938/files/13327169.pdf,,,,,https://zivahub.uct.ac.za/articles/journal_contribution/MAPS_SA_-_Reports/7239938/files/13327169.pdf,0,0,0

The costs of energy technologies especially solar. wind and battery storage have dropped significantly in recent times and have now become cost competitive with conventional fossil fuel alternatives. In South Africa. actual average tariffs from solar PV and wind electricity generation decreased from R3. 65/kWh and R1. 51/kWh in 2011 respectively to R0. 62/kWh in 2015. making it cheaper than electricity produced from a new-build coal fired power plant (R1. 03/kWh) as well as nuclear (R1. 09/kWh)(DoE 2016). While LCOE measures are useful for comparing the overall observed and expected energy cost from different technologies. it can be misleading when comparing technologies with very different characteristics. To fully understand the implications of the advances in energy technologies on future electricity generation. a fully integrated energy systems assessment is required.While South Africa’s renewable energy program has been paused due to Eskom unwillingness to purchase any new electricity produced by independent producers; ongoing advances globally are expected to lead to further price reductions in solar PV. lithium-ion battery storage and wind in the next 10 to 20 years. Projections for coal costs and further learning imply that by 2030. many markets will also have reached the point where the unitised costs of new renewable capacity are lower than even the short run marginal costs of existing coal plants–resulting in the potential of significant stranded coal assets.

In the present study. a new cost-effective reactor called gradual concentric chambers (GCC) was designed and evaluated at lab-scale. The effluent quality of the GCC reactor was compared with that of an upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor.

In this research. a treatment control design in a lab-scale was controlled by a microcontroller circuit. The developed system combined anaerobic digestion. aeration and filtration process. Its logic control algorithm was designed by using Signal Interpreted Petri Net. In the logic verification. six analysis properties were satisfied: conflict free (logical process had no conflict behavior). termination (the process could be terminated from any state). non-contradictory outputs. live (any process state could always be reached from other state). deadlock-free. and reversible (the process could always back to initial condition). In the design evaluation. the average value of transparency metrics was 0.984 close to 1 as the best value. The system performance was evaluated by pollutant removal efficiency. The highest removal efficiencies were obtained when each anaerobic and aeration treatment were performed for three days respectively and followed by filtration. Within this condition. the system obtained average removal efficiency 91.7% of Chemical Oxygen Demand and 95.4% of Total Suspended Solids.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the Au atom significantly strengthens all of the C–C bonds and weakens the C–O bonds in the meantime. making the C–C bonds stronger than the two C–O bonds in the ionized complexes. This leads to a preferential cleavage of the C–O bonds and thus a strong catalytic effect of the Au atoms in the reactions.,True,wJ5litYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,0,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/sc/d0sc03523h,,,,,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/sc/d0sc03523h,0,0,0
1317618,Manipulating the Growth of Nanomaterials in Superfluid Helium Droplets: Formation of Hybrid Nanostructures and Nanoparticle Assemblies,2019,Berlian Sitorus,,,,,,This project intends to develop a technique to fabricate nanomaterials by manipulating the growth process using superfluid helium droplets as nanoreactors. which provide a cold and confined environment where atomic or molecular dopants can aggregate into clusters and even nanoparticles. A mass spectrometric study has been used to study binary molecular clusters containing a noble metal atom and an organic compound formed in helium droplets. The co-addition of metal has been found to influence the fragmentation patterns of the organic molecules depending on the relative ionisation energies of the selected molecules and metals. Nanoparticles with different sizes and forms have been fabricated by controlling the growth conditions such as the droplet source expansion and the pickup conditions. Direct growth of nanoparticle assemblies has been demonstrated for the first time as a novel bottom-up technique for nanoparticle synthesis. The direct growth technique is based on a templated growth of nanoparticle assembly in superfluid helium droplets. in which the nanoparticle grows directly at the binding sites in a molecular template. By using this technique. we have demonstrated the feasibility to grow nanoparticle with a high degree of control on both size and the interparticle distances. Besides. semiconductor CdS and core-shell of metal/CdS in the form of nanoparticles and nanowires were also prepared by the sequential doping of metal and CdS to the helium droplets. The nanoparticles and nanowires were grown by using different nozzle positions and nozzle temperatures.

1317638,First Determination of the proton electric form factor at very small momentum transfer using initial state radiation,2017,Adrian Bartholomäus Weber,,,,,,The charge radius is a fundamental parameter of the proton and being investigated for more than 60 years [1]. When in 2010 results of the spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen were published. the proton radius puzzle arose [2]. These results differ for about 6 standard deviations from the CODATA value. determined from elastic electron-proton scattering experiments and hydrogen spectroscopy [3. 4]. To understand this discrepancy more precise measurements are necessary. For this purpose measurements of the proton electric form factor at Q2< 4· 10− 3 (GeV/c) 2 are essential. Unfortunately. this cannot be done by measuring elastic electron-proton scattering processes at the existing experimental facilities. To reach the form factor at even lower values of Q2 a method based on initial state radiation (ISR) was developed and realised. By measuring the scattered electrons in the radiative tail at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI). information about the electric form factor as low as Q2≈ 1· 10− 4 (GeV/c) 2 can be obtained.The experiment was performed at MAMI in the A1 spectrometer hall using two high resolution spectrometers. One was employed to measure the scattered electrons and the other one as a relative luminosity monitor. To minimise systematic uncertainties only the momentum acceptance of the spectrometer recording the electrons in the radiative tail was changed during the experiment. All other parameters were kept untouched. To compare the results of the ISR experiment with former results of the electric form factor. the measurements were performed at three different beam energies.

A prime question of interest in our field remains to understand how far this simple mean-field picture can be pushed before it breaks down. One expects deviations from the mean-field in the form of short-range correlations because of the strong nucleon-nucleon interaction at short distances. Such “true” two-body correlations can then be manifest as deviations-C (r1. r2)-of the two-body density from the product of one-body densities: p (r1. r2)= p (r1) p (r2)+ C (r1. r2).

While some of this excess has been shown to be accounted for by meson-exchange currents. there remains a substantial amount of data in which the excess is not yet accounted for and which may be a signature of multinucleon processes. In this talk. the results from many of the recent high missing energy (e.e'p) measurements will be reviewed. and possible interpretations discussed. Some focus will be given to an ongoing experimental program at Mainz to systematically study the high missing energy regime for {sup 3}He and {sup 4}He (MAMI Experiments A1/1-93 and A1/3-96).

One approach being pursued to meet that demand is optical integration. whereby the optical function is patterned onto an optical chip. providing a high-performance. small-footprint communication platform. Lithium niobate is an optoelectronically active material whose high modulation rates make it the workhorse material in optical communication applications. Desiatov et al. show that thin-film lithium niobate also can be used effectively at visible wavelengths. suggesting its usefulness in many sensing and imaging applications. The demonstration of ultra-low-loss waveguides and high-Q microring resonators illustrate the potential for lithium niobate as a platform for developing active and passive optically integrated device technologies.,True,ko1U0tYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,2,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6439/448.1.abstract,17533803356360519326,/scholar?cites=17533803356360519326,,,,0,0,0

1317683,Theoretical studies of proton-coupled electron transfer in interfacial and photochemical energy conversion processes,2019,Zachary K Goldsmith,,,,,,Renewable energy technologies. particularly solar. rely on processes that convert energy from and store energy in chemical bonds. Therefore. understanding and optimizing these reactions is critical to the efficient transduction of solar energy. Intrinsic to these technological reactions as well as those nature is the directed translocation of electrons and protons. These two fundamental chemical reagents often transfer concertedly and as such the kinetics of these reactions require special attention. In this dissertation. computational and theoretical characterizations of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions in electro- and photochemical energy conversion processes are presented.  A Co complex that performs highly selective. low-overpotential oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide was analyzed with density functional theory calculations. These calculations along with experimental kinetics elucidated a likely mechanism for this efficient transformation based on a rate-determining second proton transfer to a Co-hydroperoxo intermediate. In heterogeneous catalysis. a density functional theory characterization of the promising NiFe oxyhydroxide oxygen-evolving electrocatalyst is presented. Spectroelectrochemistry and calculations demonstrated the likely involvement of Fe4+ sites under catalytic current-carrying conditions. The evolution of hydrogen on Au electrodes by triethylammonium in acetonitrile solvent demonstrates a uniquely potential-dependent kinetic isotope effects.

We found that Fe (IV) is present in catalytically active. doped oxyhydroxides. consistent with the suggestions of recent in operando Mossbauer experiments. and that oxygen atoms bound to the Fe dopants might be the most active sites for OER in oxyhydroxide films.

Fosil yakıtlara çevresel ve ekonomik açıdan alternatif olarak yenilenebilir enerji kaynaklarının kullanımı artmaktadır. Yenilenebilir enerji kaynakları çevresel ve ekonomik olarak avantajlı olmalarına rağmen enerji devamlılığı gibi bazı konularda sıkıntıları bulunmaktadır. Bu amaçla güneş enerjisi. düşük sıcaklıklarda faz değiştiren sodyum asetat trihidrat maddesi üzerine depolanmıştır. Deneyler Isparta ilinde faz değiştiren maddeli ve faz değiştiren maddesiz sistemler için ayrı ayrı yapılmıştır. Sonuç olarak FDM üzerine depolanan enerji miktarı ve bulunduğu ortama etki süresi incelenmiştir. Faz değiştiren madde kullanımı ile birlikte güneş enerjisinden yararlanma süresi ortalama % 20 artmıştır.,True,Sl_K_VwAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3364098171396209743&hl=en&oi=scholarr,3364098171396209743,/scholar?cites=3364098171396209743,,,http://acikerisimarsiv.selcuk.edu.tr:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/11925/SERCAN%20G%C3%9CLCE%20G%C3%9CNG%C3%96R%2C%20AHMET%20KABUL.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

1317724,Detection of broken rotor bars of induction motors based on the combination of Hilbert envelope analysis and Shannon entropy,2021,Ahmet Kabul and Abdurrahman Ünsal,1,tm-Technisches Messen,ahead-of-print,,De Gruyter,Broken rotor bar (BRB) is one of the most common fault types of induction motors. One of the common methods to detect the broken rotor bars is the observation of the characteristic sideband frequencies in the stator current. If the motor is lightly loaded. the sideband harmonics are attached to the fundamental frequency of the main supply and the amplitudes of these harmonics are quite low. Therefore. it is difficult to detect the broken rotor bars under light loading conditions by using conventional motor current signature analysis (MCSA) methods. Moreover. in some cases. the sideband harmonics of fundamental frequency may exist although there is no rotor fault in induction motors due to load oscillations. Therefore. there is a risk for false broken rotor bars alarm with the existence of lower amplitude of harmonics. This paper provides an alternative approach for the detection of broken rotor bars by applying Hilbert …,True,Sl_K_VwAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,0,https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/teme/ahead-of-print/article-10.1515-teme-2020-0066/article-10.1515-teme-2020-0066.xml,,,,,,0,0,0
