Aging is accompanied by the imbalance of the function of several cellular homeostatic mechanisms. which results. among others. in the accumulation of abnormal (i.e. oxidized. cross-linked. unfolded) proteins. It has been proposed that the increased failure of homeostasis during aging is due to the impaired function of the major cellular proteolytic mechanisms mediated by the lysosome. the calpains and the proteasome.

We used an antibody to rat ER-60 to investigate the possible role of this protease in apolipoprotein B (apoB) degradation. First. immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments with the anti-rat ER-60 antibody suggested that HepG2 cells contain a homologue of ER-60 with an approximate molecular mass of 58–60 kDa. The ER-60 homologue was mostly associated with the luminal contents of HepG2 microsomes. Evidence from co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments appear to suggest that the ER-60 homologue in HepG2 cells is associated with apoB intracellularly.

When such cells were chased in the presence of buffer. there was no biosynthesis of apoB-100. nor was the protein secreted from the cells. Thus the turnover of apoB-100 in these cells reflected the posttranslational degradation of the protein. Pulse-chase studies indicated that apoB-100 was degraded both when associated with the membrane and when present as lipoproteins in the secretory pathway. Neither albumin nor α1-antitrypsin showed any significant posttranslational intracellular degradation under the same condition. The kinetics for the turnover of apoB-100 in the luminal content differed from that of apoB-100 that was associated with the microsomal membrane.

In pulse-chase labeling experiments. co-translational (0-h chase) apoB degradation in both intact and permeabilized cells was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. Interestingly. turnover of apoB in intact cells over a 2-h chase was partially inhibitable by lactacystin. thus suggesting a role for the cytosolic proteasome in the post-translational degradation of apoB.

Patients with overproduction states secrete denser cholesterol ester-rich lipoprotein particles which are highly atherogenic. The formation of apoB particles involves a very complex process that requires the coordinated synthesis and assembly of apoB. triglycerides. cholesterol esters. phospholipids. and other components. ApoB expression is an important prerequisite for the assembly and secretion of apoB particles. Evidence to date appears to suggest that apoB expression is regulated posttranscriptionally.

We show that MIC13 is an inner membrane protein physically interacting with MIC60. a central subunit of the MICOS complex. Using the CRISPR/Cas method we generated the first cell line deleted for MIC13. These knockout cells show a complete loss of crista junctions demonstrating that MIC13 is strictly required for the formation of crista junctions. MIC13 is required for the assembly of MIC10. MIC26. and MIC27 into the MICOS complex. However. it is not needed for the formation of the MIC60/MIC19/MIC25 subcomplex suggesting that the latter is not sufficient for crista junction formation. MIC13 is also dispensable for assembly of respiratory chain complexes and for maintaining mitochondrial network morphology.

Although they are frequently depicted as static bean-shaped structures. our view has markedly changed over the past few decades as many studies have revealed a remarkable dynamicity of mitochondrial shapes and sizes both at the cellular and intra-mitochondrial levels. Aberrant changes in mitochondrial dynamics and cristae structure are associated with ageing and numerous human diseases (eg. cancer. diabetes. various neurodegenerative diseases. types of neuro-and myopathies). Another unique feature of mitochondria is that they harbor their own genome. the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MtDNA exists in several hundreds to thousands of copies per cell and is arranged and packaged in the mitochondrial matrix in structures termed mt-nucleoids. Many human diseases are mechanistically linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and alteration of the number and/or the integrity of mtDNA. In particular. several recent studies identified remarkable and partly unexpected links between mitochondrial structure. fusion and fission dynamics. and mtDNA. In this review. we will provide an overview about these recent insights and aim to clarify how mitochondrial dynamics. cristae ultrastructure and mtDNA structure influence each other and determine mitochondrial functions.

Amino‐acid sequencing of the nine internal peptides derived from this N‐terminally blocked protein showed that it has a significant similarity to the soluble epoxide hydrolases known to date. A degenerate series of 23‐mer oligonucleotides with sequences corresponding to an internal region of eight amino‐acid residues was synthesized as a probe mixture for detection of a putative epoxide hydrolase cDNA in a developing cotyledon cDNA library.

1043557,Role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome,2012,Soleiman Mahjoub and Jila Masrour-Roudsari,3,,1,386,Babol University of Medical Sciences,The metabolic syndrome (MS) recognized as a major cause of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. has become one of the major public health challenges worldwide. The pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome is multiple and still poorly understood. No single factor has yet been identified as an underlying causal factor. There is a growing belief. however. that obesity. especially visceral obesity. may play an important role in the development of the syndrome. Visceral adiposity seems to be an independent predictor of insulin sensitivity. impaired glucose tolerance. dyslipidemia and elevated blood pressure. An increasing number of studies confirm that oxidative stress. chronic inflammation and angiogenesis all play important roles in the pathogenesis of MS.

We show here that the granules can take long or short paths to the secretory domain. Both paths utilized the same intracellular molecular events. which have different spatial and temporal arrangements and are regulated by the kinetics of Ca2+-mediated signaling. Rapid signaling caused swift granule concentration near the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and subsequent delivery by the polarized MTOC directly to the secretory domain—the shortest path. Indolent signaling led to late recruitment of granules that moved along microtubules to the periphery of the synapse and then moved tangentially to fuse at the outer edge of the secretory domain—a longer path.

Often. however. several nonconservative substitutions in the peptide antigen are accommodated and do not impair its recognition by TCR. For example. a preponderance of natural sequence variants of the human immunodeficiency virus p17 Gag-derived peptide SLYNTVATL (SL9) are recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. which implies that interactions with SL9 variants are degenerate both with respect to the class I MHC molecule and with respect to TCR. Here we study the molecular basis for this degenerate recognition of SL9 variants. We show that several SL9 variants bind comparably well to soluble HLA-A2 and to a particular soluble TCR and that these …,True,Cgwg08YAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819763352,15716563688189196328,/scholar?cites=15716563688189196328,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819763352,0,0,0

Our study aimed to evaluate the vitamin D status in patients admitted for diagnostics or exacerbation of psoriasis.Material and methods: 92 patients (50 male. 42 female. mean age 55 years) were included in analysis. Disease severity was assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Type of disease was classified according to age at presentation as early (up to 40 years) and late (above 40 years). Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. 25 (OH) D. were tested with immune fluorescent method (ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total. Siemens).Results: The mean level of 25 (OH) D in psoriatic patients was 12.07 ng/ml (30.18 nmol/l). found at low limit of insufficiency; related 95% CI range was 10.55-13.60 ng/ml (26.38-33.99 nmol/l). A total of 45 of 92 patients (48.9%) had vitamin D insufficiency (defined as 25 (OH) D level of 10 to 30 ng/ml). 44 patients (47.82%) had deficiency (< 10 ng/ml) and only in 3 patients 25 (OH) D was assessed at level of sufficiency.

1043594,GO Explorer: a gene-ontology tool to aid in the interpretation of shotgun proteomics data,2009,Paulo C Carvalho and Juliana SG Fischer and Emily I Chen and Gilberto B Domont and Maria GC Carvalho and Wim M Degrave and John R Yates and Valmir C Barbosa,7,Proteome science,1,1-11,BioMed Central,Spectral counting is a shotgun proteomics approach comprising the identification and relative quantitation of thousands of proteins in complex mixtures. However. this strategy generates bewildering amounts of data whose biological interpretation is a challenge. Here we present a new algorithm. termed GO Explorer (GOEx). that leverages the gene ontology (GO) to aid in the interpretation of proteomic data. GOEx stands out because it combines data from protein fold changes with GO over-representation statistics to help draw conclusions. Moreover. it is tightly integrated within the PatternLab for Proteomics project and. thus. lies within a complete computational environment that provides parsers and pattern recognition tools designed for spectral counting. GOEx offers three independent methods to query data: an interactive directed acyclic graph. a specialist mode where key words can be searched. and an automatic search. Its usefulness is demonstrated by applying it to help interpret the effects of perillyl alcohol. a natural chemotherapeutic agent. on glioblastoma multiform cell lines (A172). We used a new multi-surfactant shotgun proteomic strategy and identified more than 2600 proteins; GOEx pinpointed key sets of differentially expressed proteins related to cell cycle. alcohol catabolism. the Ras pathway. apoptosis. and stress response. to name a few. GOEx facilitates organism-specific studies by leveraging GO and providing a rich graphical user interface. It is a simple to use tool. specialized for biologists who wish to analyze spectral counting data from shotgun proteomics.

We show that the ATPase activity of the T4 coded gene 44/62 protein complex is stimulated synergistically by binding of DNA and T4 gene 45 protein and that the level of ATPase activation appears to be directly correlated with the binding of nucleic acid cofactor. Binding of any partially or completely single-stranded DNA to the complete accessory protein complex increases the catalytic activity (as measured by Vmax) while decreasing the binding affinity for the ATP substrate.

For comparison. this study was repeated with the [NiFe] hydrogenase from D. gigas. Hmc is very slowly reduced by the [Fe] hydrogenase. but faster by either of the two [NiFe] hydrogenases. In the presence of cytochrome c 3. in equimolar amounts to the hydrogenases. the rates of electron transfer are significantly increased and are similar for the three hydrogenases. The results obtained indicate that the reduction of Hmc by the [Fe] or [NiFe] hydrogenases is most likely mediated by cytochrome c 3.

1043632,Complexity of dopamine metabolism,2013,Johannes Meiser and Daniel Weindl and Karsten Hiller,11,,1,1-18,BioMed Central,Parkinson’s disease (PD) coincides with a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. A key player in the loss of dopaminergic neurons is oxidative stress. Dopamine (DA) metabolism itself is strongly linked to oxidative stress as its degradation generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DA oxidation can lead to endogenous neurotoxins whereas some DA derivatives show antioxidative effects. Therefore. DA metabolism is of special importance for neuronal redox-homeostasis and viability. In this review we highlight different aspects of dopamine metabolism in the context of PD and neurodegeneration. Since most reviews focus only on single aspects of the DA system. we will give a broader overview by looking at DA biosynthesis. sequestration. degradation and oxidation chemistry at the metabolic level. as well as at the transcriptional. translational and posttranslational regulation of all …,True,c9w50HsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,421,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1478-811X-11-34,12503173525139705139,/scholar?cites=12503173525139705139,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1478-811X-11-34,0,0,0

In S. cerevisiae. amino acids activate TORC1 through the Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) heterodimer composed of Gtr1 and Gtr2 found together with Ego1 and Ego3 in the EGO complex (EGOC). The GTPase activity of Gtr1 is regulated by the SEA complex (SEAC). Specifically. SEACIT. a SEAC subcomplex containing Iml1.

Hence. in cardiac stress settings in which inhibition of miR-34a provides adequate protection. this approach is likely to result in less potential off-target effects. Secondly. silencing of miR-34a alone may be insufficient in settings of established cardiac pathology.

Here. we assess whether phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K (p110α)] is essential for mediating exercise-induced cardioprotection. and if so. whether its activation independent of exercise can restore function of the failing heart. Methods and Results—Cardiac-specific transgenic mice with elevated or reduced PI3K (p110α) activity (constitutively active-caPI3K and dominant negative-dnPI3K. respectively) and nontransgenic controls (Ntg) were subjected to 4 weeks of exercise training followed by 1 week of pressure overload (aortic-banding) to induce pathological remodeling. Aortic-banding in untrained Ntg led to pathological cardiac hypertrophy. depressed systolic function and lung congestion.

Banded caPI3K mice were protected from pathological remodeling independent of exercise status. whereas exercise provided no protection in banded dnPI3K mice. suggesting that PI3K is necessary for exercise-induced cardioprotection. Transgenic overexpression of Hsp70 could not rescue the phenotype of banded dnPI3K mice. and deletion of Hsp70 from banded caPI3K mice had no effect.

Fusion is quantified in living cells by photo-conversion of matrix targeted photoactivatable GFP (mtPAGFP) in a subset of mitochondria. The rate at which the photoconverted molecules equilibrate across the entire mitochondrial population is used as a measure of fusion activity. Thus far measurements were performed using a single cell time lapse approach. quantifying the equilibration in one cell over an hour. Here. we scale up and automate a previously published live cell method based on using mtPAGFP and a low concentration of TMRE (15 nm). This method involves photoactivating a small portion of the mitochondrial network. collecting highly resolved stacks of confocal sections every 15 min for 1 hour. and quantifying the change in signal intensity. Depending on several factors such as ease of finding PAGFP expressing cells. and the signal of the photoactivated regions. it is possible to collect around 10 cells within the 15 min intervals.

Here. we present an atomic resolution structure of the periplasmic portion of the acid-sensing chemoreceptor. TlpB. from the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. The structure reveals a universal signaling fold. a PAS domain. with a molecule of urea bound with high affinity. Through biophysical. biochemical. and in vivo mutagenesis studies. we show that urea and the urea-binding site residues play critical roles in the ability of H. pylori to sense acid.

PhoQ kinase activity is repressed by divalent cations and induced in environments of acidic pH. limited divalent cations. and cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP). Upon activation. PhoQ phosphorylates the response regulator PhoP. coordinating regulation of greater than three hundred genes involved in virulence and intracellular survival.

Diabetic men had significantly higher mean levels of RAGE protein (P < 0.001) and DNA fragmentation (P < 0.001) in spermatozoa. Sperm RAGE was directly correlated to sperm DNA fragmentation in diabetic men (r = 0.81. P < 0.001).

Decreased GLO1 activity in situ has been shown to result in an accumulation of MG and increased formation of advanced glycation endproducts. both of which can accumulate during physiological aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes and other chronic degenerative diseases. To determine the physiological consequences which result from elevated MG levels and the role of MG and GLO1 in aging. wound healing in young (≤12 weeks) and old (≥52 weeks) wild-type mice was studied. Old mice were found to have a significantly slower rate of wound healing compared to young mice (74.9 ± 2.2 vs. 55.4 ± 1.5% wound closure at day 6; 26% decrease; p < 0.0001).

The use of some natural antioxidant and herbal medicine may lead to the inhibition of production of oxidized LDL and may decrease both the development and the progression of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Olive leaves ethanol extract (OLE) on LDL oxidation induced-CuSO₄ quantitatively in vitro. Low-density lipoprotein was incubated with CuSO₄ and the formation of conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Inhibition of this Cu-induced oxidation was studied in the presence of vitamin E and various concentration of OLE. It was demonstrated that OLE reduced the formation of conjugated dienes and TBARS of LDL against oxidation in vitro (P< 0.05). The inhibitory effects of the OLE on LDL oxidation were dose-dependent at concentrations ranging from (2µg/ml) to (200µg/ml). Moreover. we compared effects of OLE on LDL oxidation with vitamin E as positive control. This study showed that OLE is a source of potent antioxidants and prevented the oxidation of LDL in vitro and it may be suitable for use in food and pharmaceutical applications.,True,PyT5ErEAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,19,https://www.academia.edu/download/47857400/Effects_of_olive_leaves_extract_on_LDL_o20160807-8099-nd6vcw.pdf,5508468393457831264,/scholar?cites=5508468393457831264,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47857400/Effects_of_olive_leaves_extract_on_LDL_o20160807-8099-nd6vcw.pdf,0,0,0

PerR is a metal-dependent sensor of hydrogen peroxide. PerR is a dimeric zinc protein with a regulatory site that coordinates either Fe 2+(PerR-Zn-Fe) or Mn 2+(PerR-Zn-Mn). Though most of the peroxide sensors use cysteines to detect H 2 O 2. it has been shown that reaction of PerR-Zn-Fe with H 2 O 2 leads to the oxidation of one histidine residue. Oxidation of PerR leads to the incorporation of one oxygen atom into His37 or His91.

MIF can promote inflammation through the induction of other cytokines. including TNF. IL-6. and IL-1 family cytokines. Here. we show that inhibition of MIF regulates the release of IL-1α. IL-1β. and IL-18. not by affecting transcription or translation of these cytokines. but via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. MIF is required for the interaction between NLRP3 and the intermediate filament protein vimentin. which is critical for NLRP3 activation. Further. we demonstrate that MIF interacts with NLRP3. indicating a role for MIF in inflammasome activation independent of its role as a cytokine.

Surprisingly. neither a relaxase gene nor an origin of transfer (oriT) has been identified on these plasmids. which are typified by the 47 kb tetracycline resistance plasmid pCW3. The tcpM gene (previously called intP) encodes a potential tyrosine recombinase that was postulated to be an atypical relaxase. Mutagenesis and complementation studies showed that TcpM was required for wild‐type transfer of pCW3 and that a tyrosine residue. Y259. was essential for TcpM activity. which was consistent with the need for a relaxase‐mediated hydrophilic attack at the oriT site.

This property of a liquid marble naturally enables it to discriminately absorb or emit gaseous and vaporous compounds across its shell while denying contact or transport of liquids. Liquid marbles can. therefore. be used to form micro-gas reactors for gas detection application when loaded with an indicator solution. Liquid marble can also be used as a gas emitter; the relatively thin liquid marble shell enables the gas dissolved in the liquid marble core to be emitted to the supporting surface from a very close range. making it possible to carry out chemical sensing using the emitted gas as an indicator.

In this study. we globally profiled the proteome of MSCs to investigate critical factor(s) that may promote wound healing. Cysteine‐rich protein 61 (Cyr61) was found to be abundantly present in MSCs. The presence of Cyr61 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and immunoblot analysis. Moreover. we showed that Cyr61 is present in the culture medium (secretome) of MSCs. The secretome of MSCs stimulates angiogenic response in vitro. and neovascularization in vivo. Depletion of Cyr61 completely abrogates the angiogenic‐inducing capability of the MSC secretome.

Therefore. we sought to comprehensively characterize ERβ1 expression across all sub-types of breast cancer using a validated antibody and determine the roles of this receptor in mediating response to multiple forms of endocrine therapy both in the presence and absence of ERα expression. Nuclear and cytoplasmic expression patterns of ERβ1 were analyzed in three patient cohorts. including a retrospective analysis of a prospective adjuvant tamoxifen study and a triple negative breast cancer cohort.

Direct interference of ascorbic acid. which interferes with electrochemical detection. was eliminated by applying a cellulose acetate membrane of 100 Da molecular weight cut-off on the electrode. Indirect interference of ascorbic acid due to its auto-oxidation reaction and its reaction with nitrite is discussed. In order to stabilise the ascorbic acid. metaphosphoric acid and EDTA were added.In contrast to the standard spectrophotometric method. which requires careful control of pH and the use of carcinogenic reagents. amperometric determination of nitrite is simple. rapid. and works without reagents.

Bothrops jararaca causes many snake bites in Brazil and previous studies have demonstrated that the pharmacological activities displayed by its venom undergo a significant ontogenetic shift. Similarly. the venom proteome of B. jararaca exhibits a considerable variation upon neonate to adult transition. which is associated with changes in diet from ectothermic prey in early life to endothermic prey in adulthood. Moreover. it has been shown that the Brazilian commercial antibothropic antivenom. which is produced by immunization with adult venom. is less effective in neutralizing newborn venom effects. On the other hand. venom gland transcripts of newborn snakes are poorly known since all transcriptomic studies have been carried out using mRNA from adult specimens.   Methods/Principal Findings Here we analyzed venom gland cDNA libraries of newborn and adult B. jararaca in order to evaluate whether the variability demonstrated for its venom proteome and pharmacological activities was correlated with differences in the structure of toxin transcripts. The analysis revealed that the variability in B. jararaca venom gland transcriptomes is quantitative. as illustrated by the very high content of metalloproteinases in the newborn venom glands. Moreover. the variability is also characterized by the structural diversity of SVMP precursors found in newborn and adult transcriptomes. In the adult transcriptome. however. the content of metalloproteinase precursors considerably diminishes and the number of transcripts of serine proteinases.

Among these enzymes is CelA (CbCel9A/Cel48A). which is reported as the most highly secreted cellulolytic enzyme in this bacterium. CbCel9A/Cel48A is a large multi-modular polypeptide. composed of an N-terminal catalytic glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) module and a C-terminal GH48 catalytic module that are separated by a family 3c carbohydrate-binding module (CBM3c) and two identical CBM3bs. The wild-type CbCel9A/Cel48A and its truncational mutants were expressed in Bacillus megaterium and Escherichia coli. respectively. The wild-type polypeptide released twice the amount of glucose equivalents from Avicel than its truncational mutant that lacks the GH48 catalytic module. The truncational mutant harboring the GH9 module and the CBM3c was more thermostable than the wild-type protein. likely due to its compact structure. The main hydrolytic activity was present in the GH9 catalytic module. while the truncational mutant containing the GH48 module and the three CBMs was ineffective in degradation of either crystalline or amorphous cellulose. Interestingly. the GH9 and/or GH48 catalytic modules containing the CBM3bs form low-density particles during hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose. Moreover. TM3 (GH9/CBM3c) and TM2 (GH48 with three CBM3 modules) synergistically hydrolyze crystalline cellulose.

However. the T. reesei cellulase is weak in β-glucosidase activity. which results in accumulation of cellobiose inhibiting the endo- and exo-cellulases. By expressing an exogenous β-glucosidase gene. the recombinant T. reesei cellulase is expected to degrade cellulose into glucose more efficiently. The thermophilic β-glucosidase NfBgl3A from Neosartorya fischeri is chosen for overexpression in T. reesei due to its robust activity. In vitro. the Pichia pastoris-expressed NfBgl3A aided the T. reesei cellulase in releasing much more glucose with significantly lower amounts of cellobiose from crystalline cellulose.

For high redox potential non-phenolic lignin degradation. mediators such as GSH and unsaturated fatty acids are required in the reaction. However. it is not known whether carboxylic acids are a mediator for non-phenolic lignin degradation. The white rot fungus Irpex lacteus is one of the most potent fungi in degradation of lignocellulose and xenobiotics. Two manganese peroxidases (IlMnP1 and IlMnP2) from I. lacteus CD2 were over-expressed in Escherichia coli and successfully refolded from inclusion bodies. Both IlMnP1 and IlMnP2 oxidized the phenolic compounds efficiently. Surprisingly. they could degrade veratryl alcohol. a non-phenolic lignin compound. in a Mn2+-dependent fashion. Malonate or oxalate was found to be also essential in this degradation. The oxidation of non-phenolic lignin was further confirmed by analysis of the reaction products using LC–MS/MS. We proved that Mn2+ and a certain carboxylate are indispensable in oxidation and that the radicals generated under this condition. specifically superoxide radical. are at least partially involved in lignin oxidative degradation. IlMnP1 and IlMnP2 can also efficiently decolorize dyes with different structures. We provide evidence that a carboxylic acid may mediate oxidation of non-phenolic lignin through the action of radicals. MnPs. but not LiP.

It is important for bacteria-host interactions and has been shown to be a major virulence factor for this organism. Structurally. P. aeruginosa LPS is composed of three domains. namely. lipid A. core oligosaccharide. and the distal O antigen (O-Ag). Most P. aeruginosa strains produce two distinct forms of O-Ag. one a homopolymer of D-rhamnose that is a common polysaccharide antigen (CPA. formerly termed A band). and the other a heteropolymer of three to five distinct (and often unique dideoxy) sugars in its repeat units. known as O-specific antigen (OSA. formerly termed B band). Compositional differences in the O units among the OSA from different strains form the basis of the International Antigenic Typing Scheme for classification via serotyping of different strains of P. aeruginosa. The focus of this review is to provide state-of-the-art knowledge on the genetic and resultant functional diversity of LPS produced by P. aeruginosa.

To understand the mechanisms of securin regulation of separase. we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a near-atomic-resolution structure of the Caenorhabditis elegans separase–securin complex. Separase adopts a triangular-shaped bilobal architecture comprising an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like α-solenoid domain docked onto the conserved C-terminal protease domain. Securin engages separase in an extended antiparallel conformation. interacting with both lobes. It inhibits separase by interacting with the catalytic site through a pseudosubstrate mechanism. thus revealing that in the inhibited separase–securin …,True,6Vvsl-cAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,40,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.3386,18172314189813795268,/scholar?cites=18172314189813795268,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5385133/?src=organic&q=reorganization,0,0,0

Until recently. protein crystallography and NMR have dominated experimental approaches to obtain structural information of biological molecules. However. in recent years rapid technical developments in single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the determination to near-atomic resolution of macromolecules ranging from large multi-subunit molecular machines to proteins as small as 64 kDa. These advances have revolutionized structural biology by hugely expanding both the range of macromolecules whose structures can be determined. and by providing a description of macromolecular dynamics.

These pre-60S particles mature by transiently interacting with various assembly factors. The ~5000 amino-acid AAA+ ATPase Rea1 (or Midasin) generates force to mechanically remove assembly factors from pre-60S particles. which promotes their export to the cytosol. Here we present three Rea1 cryoEM structures. We visualise the Rea1 engine. a hexameric ring of AAA+ domains. and identify an α-helical bundle of AAA2 as a major ATPase activity regulator. The α-helical bundle interferes with nucleotide-induced conformational changes that create a docking site for the substrate binding MIDAS domain on the AAA +ring. Furthermore. we reveal the architecture of the Rea1 linker. which is involved in force generation and extends from the AAA+ ring.

The fidelity with which mRNA is translated during protein synthesis is determined by two factors: the availability of aminoacyl-tRNAs composed of cognate amino acid:tRNA pairs and the accurate selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs on the ribosome. The role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in translation is to define the genetic code by accurately pairing cognate tRNAs with their corresponding amino acids.

The fidelity of translation is mainly determined by two events: synthesis of cognate amino acid:tRNA pairs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) and accurate selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) by the ribosome. To ensure faithful aa-tRNA synthesis. many aaRSs employ a proofreading (“editing”) activity. such as phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) that hydrolyze mischarged Tyr-tRNAPhe. Eukaryotes maintain two distinct PheRS enzymes. a cytoplasmic (ctPheRS) and an organellar form.

In addition. platelets are increasingly recognized as major inflammatory cells with key roles in innate and adaptive immune responses. Activated platelets have key thromboinflammatory activities linking coagulation to inflammatory response in a variety of coagulation disorders and vasculopathies. Recently identified inflammatory activities of platelets include the synthesis of IL-1β from spliced pre-RNA. as well as the presence and assembly of inflammasome which intermediate IL-1β secretion. Here we review the mechanisms by which platelets activate translation machinery and inflammasome assembly to synthesize and release IL-1β.

In particular. butyrate is reported to regulate the physical and functional integrity of the normal colonic mucosa by altering mucin gene expression or the number of goblet cells. The objective of this study was to investigate whether butyrate modulates mucin secretion in LS174T human colorectal cells. thereby influencing the adhesion of probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains and subsequently inhibiting pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli. In addition. possible signaling pathways involved in mucin gene regulation induced by butyrate treatment were also investigated. MATERIALS/METHODS: Mucin protein content assay and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were performed in LS174T cells treated with butyrate at various concentrations. Effects of butyrate on the ability of probiotics to adhere to LS174T cells and their competition with E. coli strains were examined. Real time polymerase chain reaction for mucin gene expression and Taqman array 96-well fast plate-based pathway analysis were performed on butyrate-treated LS174T cells. RESULTS: Treatment with butyrate resulted in a dose-dependent increase in mucin protein contents in LS174T cells with peak effects at 6 or 9 mM. which was further confirmed by PAS staining. Increase in mucin protein contents resulted in elevated adherence of probiotics. which subsequently reduced the adherent ability of E. coli.

The advantages of the proposed model are as follows: considering operation sequence. alternative process plans for part types. machine time-capacity. lot splitting. maximal virtual cell size and balanced workload for virtual cells. The objective of the model is to determine the optimal number of virtual cells while minimizing the manufacturing. material handling. subcontracting. inventory holding and internal production costs in each period.

Aberrant Shh pathway activation is involved in the development of many tumors. and one of the most affected Shh signaling steps found in these tumors is the regulation of the signaling receptor Smoothened by the Shh receptor Patched. In the present work. we investigated Patched activity and the mechanism by which Patched inhibits Smoothened.   Methodology/Principal Findings Using the well-known Shh-responding cell line of mouse fibroblasts NIH 3T3. we first observed that enhancement of the intracellular cholesterol concentration induces Smoothened enrichment in the plasma membrane. which is a crucial step for the signaling activation. We found that binding of Shh protein to its receptor Patched. which involves Patched internalization. increases the intracellular concentration of cholesterol and decreases the efflux of a fluorescent cholesterol derivative (BODIPY-cholesterol) from these cells. Treatment of fibroblasts with cyclopamine. an antagonist of Shh signaling. inhibits Patched expression and reduces BODIPY-cholesterol efflux. while treatment with the Shh pathway agonist SAG enhances Patched protein expression and BODIPY-cholesterol efflux. We also show that over-expression of human Patched in the yeast S. cerevisiae results in a significant boost of BODIPY-cholesterol efflux. Furthermore. we demonstrate that purified Patched binds to cholesterol. and that the interaction of Shh with Patched inhibits the binding of Patched to …,True,9d6_cCwAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,97,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023834,5512111170798430398,/scholar?cites=5512111170798430398,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023834,0,0,0

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR2 gene that impair its function may be associated with the development of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between TLR2 Arg677Trp and 597T/C polymorphisms and PTB in a sample of Iranian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-;control study was performed on 174 PTB and 177 healthy subjects. Tetra amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (TARMS-PCR) was used to detect the SNPs. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the polymorphism of Arg677Trp of the TLR2 gene among PTB and control groups (p > 0.05). The results showed that there was a significant difference between case and control groups regarding 597T/C polymorphism (χ2 = 12.21. p = 0.002).

1044068,A comparative genomic analysis of energy metabolism in sulfate reducing bacteria and archaea,2011,Inês AC Pereira and Ana Raquel Ramos and Fabian Grein and Marta Coimbra Marques and Sofia Marques Da Silva and Sofia Santos Venceslau,2,,,69,Frontiers,The number of sequenced genomes of sulfate-reducing organisms (SRO) has increased significantly in the recent years. providing an opportunity for a broader perspective into the energy metabolism of such organisms. In this work we carried out a comparative survey of energy metabolism genes found in twenty-five available genomes of SRO. This analysis revealed a higher diversity of possible energy conserving pathways than classically considered to be present in these organisms. and permitted the identification of new proteins not known to be present in this group. The Deltaproteobacteria (and Thermodesulfovibrio yellowstonii) are characterized by a large number of cytochromes c and cytochrome c-associated membrane redox complexes. indicating that periplasmic electron transfer pathways are important in these bacteria. The Archaea and Clostridia groups contain practically no cytochromes c or associated membrane complexes. However. despite the absence of a periplasmic space. a few extracytoplasmic membrane redox proteins were detected in the Gram-positive bacteria. Several ion-translocating complexes were detected in SRO including H+-pyrophosphatases. complex I homologues. Rnf and Ech/Coo hydrogenases. Furthermore. we found evidence that cytoplasmic electron bifurcating mechanisms. recently described for other anaerobes. are also likely to play an important role in energy metabolism of SRO. A number of cytoplasmic [NiFe] and [FeFe] hydrogenases. formate dehydrogenases and heterodisulfide reductase-related proteins are likely candidates to be involved in energy coupling through electron bifurcation. from …,True,jR2K9LUAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,275,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2011.00069/full,11010535583341594093,/scholar?cites=11010535583341594093,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2011.00069/full,0,0,0

[NiFeSe] hydrogenases (Hases) are attractive candidates for the biological production of hydrogen because they are capable of high production rates even in the presence of moderate amounts of O2. lessening the requirements for anaerobic conditions. The three-dimensional structure of the [NiFeSe] Hase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough has been determined in its oxidised “as-isolated” form at 2.04-Å resolution. Remarkably. this is the first structure of an oxidised Hase of the [NiFe] family that does not contain an oxide bridging ligand at the active site.

It has been suggested that VPA acts directly on the plasma membrane. We calculated the free energy of interaction of VPA with a model lipid bilayer using simulated annealing and the continuum solvent model. Our calculations indicate that VPA is likely to partition into the bilayer both in its neutral and charged forms. as expected from such an amphipathic molecule.

The NS1 protein of influenza B virus (NS1B) specifically binds only human and nonhuman primate ISG15s and inhibits their conjugation. To elucidate the structural basis for the sequence-specific recognition of human ISG15. we determined the crystal structure of the complex formed between human ISG15 and the N-terminal region of NS1B (NS1B-NTR). The NS1B-NTR homodimer interacts with two ISG15 molecules in the crystal and also in solution. The two ISG15-binding sites on the NS1B-NTR dimer are composed of residues from both chains. namely residues in the RNA-binding domain (RBD) from one chain. and residues in the linker between the RBD and the effector domain from the other chain.

We address this by reporting on the self‐association of H‐NS and its hetero‐association with StpA. We identify residues 1–77 of H‐NS as being necessary and sufficient for high‐order association. A multi‐technique‐based approach was used to measure the effects of salt concentration on the size distribution of H‐NS and the thermal stability of H‐NS and StpA dimers.

In nonstimulated cells. the SH3 domain (and not the SH2 domains) of Plcγ1 directly competes for a binding site at the very C terminus of FGFR2 with the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. Reduction of Grb2 concentration permits Plcγ1 access to the receptor. Recruitment of Plcγ1 in this way is sufficient to upregulate phospholipase activity. This results in elevated phosphatidylinositol 4. 5-bisphosphate turnover and intracellular calcium levels. thus leading to increased cell motility and promotion of cell-invasive behavior in the absence of extracellular receptor stimulation.

However. recent studies have suggested that probiotics could have beneficial effects beyond gastrointestinal health. as they were found to improve certain metabolic disorders such as hypertension. Hypertension is caused by various factors and the predominant causes include an increase in cholesterol levels. incidence of diabetes. inconsistent modulation of renin and imbalanced sexual hormones. This review discusses the antihypertensive roles of probiotics via the improvement and/or treatment of lipid profiles. modulation of insulin resistance and sensitivity. the modulation of renin levels and also the conversion of bioactive phytoestrogens as an alternative replacement of sexual hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.

However. growth of first. second. and third passages of treated cells was comparable with that of the control. which may be attributed to the resealing of transient pores on the cellular membrane. Electroporation also increased (P< 0.05) assimilation of cholesterol by treated parent cells (> 185.40%) and first passage (> 21.72%) compared with that of the control. Meanwhile. incorporation of cholesterol into the cellular membrane was also increased (P< 0.05) in the treated parent cells (> 108.33%) and first passage (> 26.67%). accompanied by increased ratio of cholesterol: phospholipids (C: P) in these passages.

In addition to being an anticoagulant. AT also exhibits antiinflammatory activities when it binds to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the endothelium via its basic residues of D-helix to elicit intracellular signaling responses. By contrast to AT. α 1-proteinase inhibitor (α 1-PI) is a non-heparin-binding serpin that exhibits very slow reactivity with coagulation proteases and possesses no HSPG-dependent antiinflammatory properties.

GNP proliferation and thus cerebellar development require Sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted from Purkinje cells. Shh signaling occurs in primary cilia originating from the mother centriole. Centrioles replicate only once during a typical cell cycle and are responsible for mitotic spindle assembly and organization. Recent studies have linked cilia function to cerebellar morphogenesis. but the role of centriole duplication in cerebellar development is not known. Here we show that centrosomal protein Cep120 is asymmetrically localized to the daughter centriole through its interaction with Talpid3 (Ta3). another centrosomal protein. Cep120 null mutant mice die in early gestation with abnormal heart looping. Inactivation of Cep120 in the central nervous system leads to both hydrocephalus. due to the loss of cilia on ependymal cells. and severe cerebellar hypoplasia. due to the failed proliferation of GNPs. The mutant GNPs lack Hedgehog pathway activity.

In this Article. Professor Rogers argues to the contrary that. at least with respect to prospective bankruptcy legislation. the bankruptcy clause itself and not the fifth amendment limits congressional bankruptcy power. His view derives from nineteenth and twentieth century case law. particularly cases assessing the validity of restraints on secured creditors' foreclosure rights. and from the theoretical difficulty of distinguishing between supposedly protected property rights and supposedly unprotected contract interests. Professor Rogers also sharply criticizes the Supreme Court's analysis in the recently decided Security Industrial Bank case. which concerned the extent to which fifth amendment principles limit retroactive application of bankruptcy …,True,MGmYWIYAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,210,https://www.jstor.org/stable/1340997,6359900526003806385,/scholar?cites=6359900526003806385,,https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1059&context=lsfp,0,0,0

Processivity is essential in nature and is often mediated by a clamp-like structure that physically tethers the catalyst to its (polymeric) template. In the case of the bacteriophage T4 replisome. a dedicated clamp protein acts as a processivity mediator by encircling DNA and subsequently recruiting its polymerase. Here we use this DNA-binding protein to construct a biohybrid catalyst. Conjugation of the clamp protein to a chemical catalyst with sequence-specific oxidation behaviour formed a catalytic clamp that can be loaded onto a DNA plasmid.

Yet the respective polymerases act processively. implying that the recycling of the lagging strand polymerase is a controlled process. We demonstrate that the rate of the lagging strand polymerase relative to that of fork movement affects Okazaki fragment size and generates ssDNA gaps.

One hallmark of CWD is the shedding of infectious prions in saliva. as demonstrated by bioassay in deer. It is also clear that the concentration of prions in saliva. blood. urine and feces is much lower than in the nervous system or lymphoid tissues. Rapid in vitro detection of CWD (and other) prions in body fluids and excreta has been problematic due to the sensitivity limits of direct assays (western blotting. ELISA) and the presence of inhibitors in these complex biological materials that hamper detection. Here we use real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC) to demonstrate CWD prions in both diluted and prion-enriched saliva samples from asymptomatic and symptomatic white-tailed deer. CWD prions were detected in 14 of 24 (58.3%) diluted saliva samples from CWD-exposed white-tailed deer. including 9 of 14 asymptomatic animals (64.2%). In addition. a phosphotungstic acid enrichment enhanced the RT-QuIC assay sensitivity. enabling detection in 19 of 24 (79.1%) of the above saliva samples. Bioassay in Tg[CerPrP] mice confirmed the presence of infectious prions in 2 of 2 RT-QuIC-positive saliva samples so examined.

Stereocilia maintenance is essential because auditory hair cells are not renewed in mammals. This process requires both β-actin and γ-actin as knock-out mice lacking either isoform develop distinct stereocilia pathology during aging. In addition. stereocilia integrity may hinge on immobilizing actin. which outside of a small region at stereocilia tips turns over with a very slow. months-long half-life.

Diamond and Qiang Chen.,,Plant Biotechnology Journal,,,,Pharmaceutical protein production in plants has been greatly promoted by the development of viral‐based vectors and transient expression systems. Tobacco and related Nicotiana species are currently the most common host plants for the generation of plant‐made pharmaceutical proteins (PMPs). Downstream processing of target PMPs from these plants. however. is hindered by potential technical and regulatory difficulties owing to the presence of high levels of phenolics and toxic alkaloids. Here. we explored the use of lettuce. which grows quickly yet produces low levels of secondary metabolites and viral vector‐based transient expression systems to develop a robust PMP production platform.

In this study. we developed several pHu-E16 variants to improve its efficacy. These variants included a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of pHu-E16 fused to the heavy chain (HC) constant domains (CH1-3) of human IgG (pHu-E16scFv-CH1-3) and a tetravalent molecule (Tetra pHu-E16) assembled from pHu-E16scFv-CH1-3 with a second pHu-E16scFv fused to the light chain (LC) constant region. pHu-E16scFv-CH1-3 and Tetra pHu-E16 were efficiently expressed and assembled in plants. To assess the impact of differences in N-linked glycosylation on pHu-E16 variant assembly and function. we expressed additional pHu-E16 variants with various combinations of HC and LC components.

A plant expression system is attractive for protein production due to its low-cost and high-scalability nature and its ability to make appropriate posttranslational modifications. Here. we investigated the feasibility of using plants to produce two WNV detection and diagnostic reagents to address the current cost and scalability issues. We demonstrated that WNV DIII antigen and E16 monoclonal antibody are rapidly produced at high levels in two plant species and are easily purified. Furthermore. they are effective in identifying WNV and in detecting human IgM response to WNV infection.

Using various combinations of vector modules of a deconstructed viral vector expression system. DIII was produced in three subcellular compartments in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana by transient expression. DIII expressed at much higher levels when targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) than that targeted to the chloroplast or the cytosol. with accumulation level up to 73 μg DIII per gram of leaf fresh weight within 4 days after infiltration. Plant ER-derived DIII was soluble and readily purified to > 95% homogeneity without the time-consuming process of denaturing and refolding. Further analysis revealed that plant-produced DIII was processed properly and demonstrated specific binding to an anti-DIII monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope.

In mosquitoes. XA is produced by transamination of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK). a reaction that represents the main route to prevent the accumulation of the potentially toxic 3-HK excess. Interfering with XA metabolism in A. gambiae therefore appears an attractive avenue for the development of malaria transmission-blocking drugs and insecticides. We have determined the crystal structure of A. gambiae 3-HK transaminase in its pyridoxal 5′-phosphate form and in complex with a newly synthesized competitive enzyme inhibitor. Structural inspection of the enzyme active site reveals the key molecular determinants for ligand recognition and catalysis.

They break down chitin. which is the second most abundant carbohydrate in nature after cellulose. Hence. they are important for maintaining a balance between carbon and nitrogen trapped as insoluble chitin in biomass. Chitinases are classified into two families. 18 and 19 glycoside hydrolases. In addition to a catalytic domain. which is a triosephosphate isomerase barrel. many family 18 chitinases contain another module. i.e.. chitinase insertion domain. While numerous studies focus on the biological role of the catalytic domain in chitinase activity. the function of the chitinase insertion domain is not completely understood. Bioinformatics offers an important avenue in which to facilitate understanding the role of residues within the chitinase insertion domain in chitinase function.  Results Twenty-seven chitinase insertion domain sequences. which include four experimentally determined structures and span five kingdoms. were aligned and analyzed using a modified sequence entropy parameter. Thirty-two positions with conserved residues were identified. The role of these conserved residues was explored by conducting a structural analysis of a number of holo-enzymes. Hydrogen bonding and van der Waals calculations revealed a distinct subset of four conserved residues constituting two sequence motifs that interact with oligosaccharides.

Govorunova and Hai Li,112,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,46,14236–14241,PNAS,Anion channelrhodopsins (ACRs) are a class of light-gated channels recently identified in cryptophyte algae that provide unprecedented fast and powerful hyperpolarizing tools for optogenetics. Analysis of photocurrents generated by Guillardia theta ACR 1 (GtACR1) and its mutants in response to laser flashes showed that GtACR1 gating comprises two separate mechanisms with opposite dependencies on the membrane voltage and pH and involving different amino acid residues. The first mechanism. characterized by slow opening and fast closing of the channel. is regulated by Glu-68. Neutralization of this residue (the E68Q mutation) specifically suppressed this first mechanism. but did not eliminate it completely at high pH. Our data indicate the involvement of another. yet-unidentified pH-sensitive group X.

We report analysis of flash-induced absorption changes in purified wild-type and mutant ACRs. and of photocurrents they generate in HEK293 cells. Contrary to cation channelrhodopsins (CCRs). the ion conducting state of ACRs develops in an L-like intermediate that precedes the deprotonation of the retinylidene Schiff base (i.e.. formation of an M intermediate). Channel closing involves two mechanisms leading to depletion of the conducting L-like state: (i) Fast closing is caused by a reversible L⇔M conversion. Glu-68 in Guillardia theta ACR1 plays an important role in this transition. likely serving as a counterion and proton acceptor at least at high and neutral pH.

Bacterial toxins. which specifically bind to cell surface-exposed glycosphingolipids. are a potential novel therapy. We determined the expression of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3Cer/CD77). the Shiga toxin receptor. in human pancreatic and colon adenocarcinomas.  Methodology/Principal Findings Tissue lipid extracts of matched pairs of cancerous and adjacent normal tissue from 21 pancreatic and 16 colon cancer patients were investigated with thin-layer chromatography overlay assay combined with a novel mass spectrometry approach. Gb3Cer/CD77 was localized by immunofluorescence microscopy of cryosections from malignant and corresponding healthy tissue samples. 62% of pancreatic and 81% of colon adenocarcinomas showed increased Gb3Cer/CD77 expression. whereas 38% and 19% of malignant pancreas and colon tissue. respectively. did not. indicating an association of this marker with neoplastic transformation. Also. Gb3Cer/CD77 was associated with poor differentiation (G>2) in pancreatic cancer (P = 0.039). Mass spectrometric analysis evidenced enhanced expression of Gb3Cer/CD77 with long (C24) and short chain fatty acids (C16) in malignant tissues and pointed to the presence of hydroxylated fatty acid lipoforms. which are proposed to be important for receptor targeting. They could be detected in 86% of pancreatic and about 19% of colon adenocarcinomas. Immunohistology of tissue cryosections indicated tumor-association of these receptors.

Lam4p and their homologs Ysp1p and Sip3p target punctate ER-PM contact sites distinct from those occupied by known ER-PM tethers. The activity of Ysp2p. reflected in amphotericin-sensitivity assays. requires its second StART-like domain to be positioned so that it can reach across ER-PM contacts. Absence of Ysp2p.

A large number of contact sites have been discovered. and almost any two organelles can contact each other. General rules about contacts include constraints on bridging proteins. with only a minority of bridges physically creating contacts by acting as ‘tethers’. The downstream effects of contacts include changing the physical behaviour of organelles. and also forming biochemically heterogeneous subdomains. However. some functions typically localized to contact sites. such as lipid transfer. have no absolute requirement to be situated there.

Only a minority of lipids achieve their final intracellular distribution through transport by vesicles. Instead. the bulk of lipid traffic is mediated by a large group of lipid transfer proteins (LTPs). which move small numbers of lipids at a time using hydrophobic cavities that stabilize lipid molecules outside membranes. Although the first LTPs were discovered almost 50 years ago. most progress in understanding these proteins has been made in the past few years. leading to considerable temporal and spatial refinement of our understanding of the function of these lipid transporters.

The general aim would be to change the phenotype of myeloid cells from pro- to anti-inflammatory. favoring their tissue-trophic and regenerative functions. Myeloid cells. however. display a number of functional phenotypes. not immediately identifiable as pro- or anti-inflammatory. and associated to ambiguous markers. We employed in vitro assays to study macrophage polarization/differentiation in the presence of classical polarizing stimuli such as IFNγ (pro-inflammatory) and IL4 (anti-inflammatory). We induced neuroinflammation in mice by immunization with a myelin antigen and treated diseased mice with intracisternal delivery of an IL4-expressing lentiviral vector. We analyzed clinical. pathological. and immunological outcomes with a focus on myeloid cells. We found that IL6. usually considered a pro-inflammatory cytokine. was released in vitro by macrophages treated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL4. We show the existence of macrophages expressing IL6 along with classical anti-inflammatory markers such as CD206 and demonstrate that these cells are immunosuppressive in vitro. In neuroinflamed mice. we show that IL4 delivery in the central nervous system (CNS) is associated with clinical and pathological protection from disease. associated with increased IL6 expression in infiltrating macrophages.

The crystal structure of the central domain of Aster-A broadly resembles the sterol-binding fold of mammalian StARD proteins. but sequence differences in the Aster pocket result in a distinct mode of ligand binding. The Aster N-terminal GRAM domain binds phosphatidylserine and mediates Aster recruitment to plasma membrane-ER contact sites in response to cholesterol accumulation in the plasma membrane.

Recent studies suggested that multiple copies of Munc13 form nanoassemblies in active zones of neurons. However. it is not known if such clustering is an inherent self-assembly property of Munc13 or whether Munc13 clusters indirectly by multivalent binding to synaptic vesicles or specific plasma membrane domains at docking sites in the active zone.  The functional significance of putative Munc13 clustering is also unknown.  Here we report that nano-clustering is an inherent property of Munc13. and is indeed required for vesicle binding to bilayers containing Munc13.  Pure Munc13 reconstituted onto supported lipid bilayers assembled into clusters containing from 2 to ~20 copies as revealed by a combination of quantitative TIRF microscopy and step-wise photobleaching.  Surprisingly. only clusters a minimum of 6 copies of Munc13 were capable of efficiently capturing and retaining small unilamellar vesicles.

1044304,CDK1 controls CHMP7-dependent nuclear envelope reformation,2020,Alberto T Gatta and Yolanda Olmos and Caroline L Stoten and Jeremy G Carlton,,BioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Through the process of annular fusion and disassembly of spindle microtubules. the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery has emerged as a key player in the regeneration of a sealed nuclear envelope during mitotic exit. and in the repair of this organelle during interphase rupture. ESCRT-III polymerisation at the nuclear envelope occurs transiently during mitotic exit and CHMP7. an ER-localised ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein. initiates assembly in a manner dependent upon the INM protein LEM2. Whilst classical nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanisms have been proposed to separate LEM2 and CHMP7 during interphase. it is unclear how CHMP7 assembly is suppressed in mitosis when NE and ER identities are mixed. Here. we use live cell imaging and protein biochemistry to examine the biology of these proteins during mitotic exit. We show that CHMP7 plays an important role in disaggregating LEM2 clusters at the reforming nuclear envelope during mitotic exit to allow proper nuclear regeneration. Further. we show that CDK1 phosphorylates CHMP7 upon mitotic entry and suppresses its polymerisation. preventing its inappropriate capture of LEM2 in the peripheral ER during mitotic exit. Lastly. we establish that a microtubule network is dispensable for ESCRT-III assembly at the reforming nuclear envelope.

Selection of optimal strains is often based on direct comparison under laboratory conditions of maximal growth rate or additional valued features such as lipid content. Instead of reporting growth rate in culture. estimation of photosynthetic efficiency (quantum yield of PSII) by pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorimetry is an often applied alternative method. Here we compared the quantum yield of PSII and the photonic yield on biomass for the green alga Chlorella sorokiniana 211-8K and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our data demonstrate that the PAM technique inherently underestimates the photosynthetic efficiency of cyanobacteria by rendering a high F0 and a low FM. specifically after the commonly practiced dark pre-incubation before a yield measurement. Yet when comparing the calculated biomass yield on light in continuous culture experiments. we obtained nearly equal values for both species. Using mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. we analyzed the factors that compromise its PAM-based quantum yield measurements.

To investigate the metabolic consequences of antibiotic resistance. the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of an amoxicillin-resistant Escherichia coli strain and the wild type it was derived from were compared. A total of 125 amino acid substitutions and 7 mutations that were located <1.000 bp upstream of differentially expressed genes were found in resistant cells. However. broad induction and suppression of genes were observed when comparing the expression profiles of resistant and wild-type cells. Expression of genes involved in cell wall maintenance.

However. to what extent elevated CO2 will induce evolutionary changes in photosynthetic organisms is still a major open question. Here. we show rapid microevolutionary adaptation of a harmful cyanobacterium to changes in inorganic carbon (Ci) availability. We studied the cyanobacterium Microcystis. a notorious genus that can develop toxic cyanobacterial blooms in many eutrophic lakes and reservoirs worldwide. Microcystis displays genetic variation in the Ci uptake systems BicA and SbtA. where BicA has a low affinity for bicarbonate but high flux rate. and SbtA has a high affinity but low flux rate. Our laboratory competition experiments show that bicA + sbtA genotypes were favored by natural selection at low CO2 levels. but were partially replaced by the bicA genotype at elevated CO2.

Photophysiological acclimation of the chrysophyte Ochromonas danica after feeding,2014,Susanne Wilken and J Merijn Schuurmans and Hans CP Matthijs,204,New Phytologist,4,882-889,,  Mixotrophy is increasingly recognized as an important and widespread nutritional strategy in various taxonomic groups ranging from protists to higher plants. We hypothesize that the availability of alternative carbon and energy sources during mixotrophy allows a switch to photoheterotrophic growth. where the photosynthetic apparatus mainly provides energy but not fixed carbon. Because such a change in the function of the photosynthetic machinery is probably reflected in its composition. we compared the photosynthetic machinery in Ochromonas danica during autotrophic and mixotrophic growth. Compared with autotrophic growth. the total pigmentation of O. danica was reduced during mixotrophic growth. Furthermore. the photosystem I (PSI):PSII ratio increased. and the cellular content of Rubisco decreased not only absolutely. but also relative to the content of PSII.

Inc.,The acquisition of resistance to amoxicillin. tetracycline. and enrofloxacin by Escherichia coli MG 1655 was examined by exposing growing cells to constant or stepwise increasing concentrations of these compounds. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of E. coli for amoxicillin increased from 4–8 to 32 μg/ml after growth in the presence of 1.25 or 2.5 μg/ml.

We show how this can be done via the control of the transporter on the specific growth rate; they are identical if the transport step has full control. The analysis leads to the counter-intuitive result that the affinity of an organism for its substrate is expected to be higher than the affinity of the enzyme that facilitates its transport. Experimentally. we show this indeed to be the case for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. for which we determined a KM value for glucose more than two times higher than the KS value in glucose-limited chemostat cultures.

Although the causes of breast cancer remain unclear. it has been speculated that DNA base damage may lead to mutations that subsequently can be carcinogenic. Recently. defective oxidative DNA damage repair has been implicated in breast tumorigenesis. The major oxidative DNA lesion. 8-hydroxyguanine (8-oxoG). is increased in breast cancer. suggesting that this lesion may play a crucial role in the etiology of breast cancer. However. it is not known whether the repair of 8-oxoG or other oxidative base lesions is altered during breast carcinogenesis. We examined the ability of nuclear and mitochondrial extracts of two human breast cancer cell lines. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468. to repair 8-oxoG lesion.

Secretion of proteins across membranes and the assembly of complex macromolecular structures must be highly coordinated to avoid the accumulation of potentially toxic intracellular protein aggregates.

PAP248-286 only enhances HIV infection in the form of amyloid aggregates termed SEVI (Semen Enhancer of Viral Infection). however monomeric PAP248-286 aggregates very slowly in isolation. It has therefore been suggested that SEVI fiber formation in vivo may be promoted by exogenous factors. We show here that a bacterially-produced extracellular amyloid (curli or Csg) acts as a catalytic agent for SEVI formation from PAP248-286 at low concentrations in vitro. producing fibers that retain the ability to enhance HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. Kinetic analysis of the cross-seeding effect shows an unusual pattern. Cross-seeding PAP248-286 with curli only moderately affects the nucleation rate while significantly enhancing the growth of fibers from existing nuclei. This pattern is in contrast to most previous observations of cross-seeding. which show cross-seeding partially bypasses the nucleation step but has little effect on fiber elongation. Seeding other amyloidogenic proteins (IAPP (islet amyloid polypeptide) and Aβ1−40) with curli showed varied results. Curli cross-seeding decreased the lag-time of IAPP amyloid formation but strongly inhibited IAPP elongation. Curli cross-seeding exerted a complicated concentration dependent effect on Aβ1−40 fibrillogenesis kinetics.

CsgC was also found to arrest amyloid formation of the human amyloidogenic protein α-synuclein. which is involved in Parkinson’s disease.

MMR is critical for genome maintenance. and its loss increases mutation rates several hundred fold. Recent work has shown that the interaction between the mismatch recognition protein MutS and the replication processivity clamp is important for MMR in Bacillus subtilis. To further understand how MMR is coupled to DNA replication. we examined the subcellular localization of MMR and DNA replication proteins fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in live cells. following an increase in DNA replication errors.

This is particularly significant for colorectal cancer. which is a heterogeneous complex of diseases developed in a sequential manner through a multistep carcinogenic process. As such. it is likely that tumors with similar characteristics might originate in the same manner and have a similar molecular behavior. Therefore. specific mapping of the molecular features can be potentially useful for both tumor classification and the development of appropriate therapeutic regimens. However. this can only be accomplished by developing high-affinity molecular probes with the ability to recognize specific markers associated with different tumors. Aptamers can most easily meet this challenge based on their target diversity. flexible manipulation and ease of development.   Methodology and Results Using a method known as cell-based Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment (cell-SELEX) and colorectal cancer cultured cell lines DLD-1 and HCT 116. we selected a panel of target-specific aptamers. Binding studies by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy showed that these aptamers have high affinity and selectivity. Our data further show that these aptamers neither recognize normal colon cells (cultured and fresh). nor do they recognize most other cancer cell lines tested.

1044385,Glyphosate bioremediation through the sarcosine oxidase pathway mediated by Lysinibacillus sphaericus in soils cultivated with potatoes,2019,Mario Pérez Rodríguez and Carol Melo and Elizabeth Jiménez and Jenny Dussán,9,Agriculture,10,217,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) use has increased drastically over the last decade. This is true especially for potato crops due to their fast harvest cycle and high market demand. In 2015. the World Health Organization (WHO) classified glyphosate and its breakdown product amidomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) as probably carcinogenic to humans. and it has been reported that these compounds disrupt the ecological and nutritional equilibrium of soils. However. microorganisms with the sarcosine oxidase gene. such as Lysinibacillus sphaericus. can degrade glyphosate through the Carbon-Phosphorus (CP) pathway without leading to AMPA production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the addition of the plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) L. sphaericus as a bioremediation agent in a potato crop sprayed with a GBH. in conjunction with the nitrogen fixation activity mediated by the bacteria. To that end. a GBH solution was used to treat a potato field. and different treatments (glyphosate (G). bacteria (B). bacteria+ glyphosate (BG). and negative control (C)) were evaluated by measuring the glyphosate. AMPA. nitrates. and ammonium concentrations. BG treatment showed a 79% reduction of glyphosate concentration in soil. leading to minimal AMPA production. compared to the 23% reduction observed after G treatment. Furthermore. the ammonium concentrations were significantly higher in samples treated with BG and in C samples (p< 0.005). Therefore. we propose the addition of L. sphaericus as a good bioremediation strategy for soils sprayed with GBH.

In general. microglial cells are more active in responding to cytokines and LPS than astrocytes in the induction of NO.

Because the p53 DNA binding domain (DBD) is naturally unstable and possesses an amyloidogenic sequence. it is prone to form amyloid fibrils. causing loss of functions. To develop p53 therapies. it is necessary to understand the molecular basis of p53 instability and aggregation.

We used high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) coupled with NMR spectroscopy to study the dissociation of α-syn fibril into monomers and evaluate their structural and dynamic properties. Different dynamic properties in the non-amyloid-β component (NAC). which constitutes the Greek-key hydrophobic core. and in the acidic C-terminal region of the protein were identified by HHP NMR spectroscopy. In addition. solid-state NMR revealed subtle differences in the HHP-disturbed fibril core. providing clues to how these species contribute to seeding α-syn aggregation. These findings show how pressure can populate so far undetected α-syn species. and they lay out a roadmap for fibril dissociation via pathways not previously observed using other approaches.

In both isoforms. binding to CaM is diffusion limited and within approximately three orders of magnitude of the Smoluchowski limit imposed by orientation‐independent collisions. This suggests that the orientation of CaM is facilitated by the charge arrays on the CaM‐binding site and the complementary surface on CaM. Protein kinase C phosphorylation of eNOS T495. adjacent to the CaM‐binding site. abolishes or greatly slows CaM binding. Kinases which increase the activity of eNOS did not stimulate the binding of CaM. which is already diffusion limited.

Myxococcus xanthus cells undergo programmed cell death (PCD) whereby 80% of vegetative cells die. Previously. the MazF RNA interferase has been implicated in this role. Recently. it was shown that deletion of the mazF gene does not eliminate PCD in wild‐type strain DK1622 as originally seen in DZF1. To clarify the role of MazF. recombinant enzyme was characterized using a highly sensitive assay in the presence and absence of the proposed antitoxin MrpC.

At a defined point in flagellar morphogenesis. hook completion is sensed and the apparatus switches substrate specificity type from rod and hook proteins to filament ones. How the switch works is a subject of intense interest. FliK and FlhB play central roles. In the present study. two optical biosensing methods were used to characterize FliK−FlhB interactions using wild-type and two variant FlhBs from mutants with severe flagellar structural defects.

The heterochiral dimers are in general the most stable ones. but amphiprotic substituents that are able to form attactive interactions with twin groups revert this tendency. Energy differences up to 4.0 kcal/mol have been found favoring the homo- or heterochiral complexes. Two possible proton-transfer processes have been studied. the concerted one and the nonconcerted one. The compresion of the systems in the transition structures produce an increase in the energetic differences when compared to the corresponding minima complexes.

Traditional methods for enhancing cellular tolerances are inefficient and time-consuming. Recently. approaches employing global transcriptional or translational engineering methods have been increasingly explored. We found that an exogenous global regulator. irrE from an extremely radiation-resistant bacterium. Deinococcus radiodurans. has the potential to act as a global regulator in Escherichia coli. and that laboratory-evolution might be applied to alter this regulator to elicit different phenotypes for E. coli.   Methodology/Principal Findings To extend the methodology for strain improvement and to obtain higher tolerances toward different stresses. we here describe an approach of engineering irrE gene in E. coli. An irrE library was constructed by randomly mutating the gene. and this library was then selected for tolerance to ethanol. butanol and acetate stresses. Several mutants showing significant tolerances were obtained and characterized. The tolerances of E. coli cells containing these mutants were enhanced 2 to 50-fold. based on cell growth tests using different concentrations of alcohols or acetate. and enhanced 10 to 100-fold based on ethanol or butanol shock experiments. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays showed that intracellular ROS levels were sharply reduced for cells containing the irrE mutants.

Efficient fermentation of xylose is important for the economics of biomass-based biorefineries. However. sugar mixtures are sequentially consumed in xylose co-fermentation with glucose due to carbon catabolite repression (CCR) in microorganisms. As xylose transmembrance transport is one of the steps repressed by CCR. it is therefore of interest to develop a transporter that is less sensitive to the glucose inhibition or CCR. The glucose facilitator protein Glf transporter from Zymomonas mobilis. also an efficient transporter for xylose. was chosen as the target transporter for engineering to eliminate glucose inhibition on xylose uptake.

With these polymerases. we now report the first selection of fully 2′-OMe modified aptamers. specifically aptamers that bind human neutrophil elastase (HNE). Two aptamers. 2mHNE-1 and 2mHNE-2. were isolated after five rounds of selection. and four more. 2mHNE-3–6. after an additional five rounds that included selection pressure for binding in the presence of serum.

Zinc is relevant for good immune functioning. Restoration of zinc into both the thymus and thymocytes subsets in the late period of liver regeneration is observed in young pHx mice. These findings have suggested a link between the thymus and the liver influencing T-cell functions and involving zinc. This kind of link could be relevant in aging because thymic involution. negative crude zinc balance and crippled immune functions are constant events. The preminence of a liver extrathymic T-cell pathway after pHx or during aging has been suggested.

Resveratrol. the most extensively studied constituent. is unlikely to solely account for these beneficial effects because of its rather low abundance and bioavailability. Malvidin is far the most abundant polyphenol in red wine; however. very limited data are available about its effect on inflammatory processes and kinase signaling pathways.

In cancer cells. epigenetic changes (e.g.. DNA hypermethylation) are essential to maintain this drug-resistant phenotype. Thus. altered lipid synthesis may be linked to epigenetic mechanisms of drug resistance.

Therefore. the most important goal of drug delivery is to minimize the exposure of normal tissues to these drugs while maintaining their therapeutic concentration in tumors.

NY: Academic Press. 1952-,The opportunistic human pathogens Candida albicans and other non-albicans species have acquired considerable significance in the recent past due to the enhanced susceptibility of immunocompromised patients. These pathogenic species of Candida derive their importance not only from the severity of their infections but also from their ability to develop resistance against antifungals. Widespread and prolonged use of azoles has led to the rapid development of the phenomenon of multidrug resistance (MDR). which poses a major hurdle in antifungal therapy. Various mechanisms that contribute to the development of MDR have been implicated in Candida as well as in other human fungal pathogens. and some of these include overexpression of or mutations in the target enzyme of azoles. lanosterol 14α-demethylase. and transcriptional activation of genes encoding drug efflux pump proteins belonging to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) as well as to major facilitator superfamilies (MFS) of transporters.

The introduction of deletions and insertions through mutagenesis was used to address the role of the largest interdomain ICL3 of the MDR1 protein. Most of the progressive deletants. when overexpressed. eliminated the drug resistance. Notably. restoration of the length of the ICL3 by insertional mutagenesis did not restore the functionality of the protein. Interestingly. most of the insertion and deletion variants of ICL3 became amenable to trypsinization. yielding peptide fragments.

1044543,Rational mutational analysis of a multidrug MFS transporter CaMdr1p of Candida albicans by employing a membrane environment based computational approach,2009,Khyati Kapoor and Mohd Rehan and Ajeeta Kaushiki and Ritu Pasrija and Andrew M Lynn and Rajendra Prasad,5,PLoS Comput Biol,12,e1000624,Public Library of Science,CaMdr1p is a multidrug MFS transporter of pathogenic Candida albicans. An over-expression of the gene encoding this protein is linked to clinically encountered azole resistance. In-depth knowledge of the structure and function of CaMdr1p is necessary for an effective design of modulators or inhibitors of this efflux transporter. Towards this goal. in this study. we have employed a membrane environment based computational approach to predict the functionally critical residues of CaMdr1p. For this. information theoretic scores which are variants of Relative Entropy (Modified Relative Entropy REM) were calculated from Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) by separately considering distinct physico-chemical properties of transmembrane (TM) and inter-TM regions. The residues of CaMdr1p with high REM which were predicted to be significantly important were subjected to site-directed mutational analysis. Interestingly. heterologous host Saccharomyces cerevisiae. over-expressing these mutant variants of CaMdr1p wherein these high REM residues were replaced by either alanine or leucine. demonstrated increased susceptibility to tested drugs. The hypersensitivity to drugs was supported by abrogated substrate efflux mediated by mutant variant proteins and was not attributed to their poor expression or surface localization. Additionally. by employing a distance plot from a 3D deduced model of CaMdr1p. we could also predict the role of these functionally critical residues in maintaining apparent inter-helical interactions to provide the desired fold for the proper functioning of CaMdr1p.

The enthalpy and entropy of micelle formation are evaluated according to the phase separation model. The surface tension of solutions was determined by means of Du Nöuys ring. The CMC values were taken from the sharp breaks in the surface tension vs. logarithms of surfactant concentration plots. As the surfactants' chain length increases the CMC at a constant temperature decreases. which is directly related to the decrease of hydrophilicity of the molecules. For each surfactant. as the system temperature increases. the CMC initially decreases and then increases. owing to the smaller probability of hydrogen bond formation at higher temperatures. The onset of micellization tends to occur at higher concentrations as the temperature increases. To evaluate the enthalpy of micellization. the CMCs are first correlated by a polynomial equation. It is found that ∆Gºm decreases monotonically as the temperature increases over the whole temperature range. Both ∆Hºm and ∆Sºm appear to be decrease monotonically with an increase in temperature.

Tight regulation of cellular c-di-GMP concentration is governed by diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases. which are responsible for its production and degradation. respectively. Here. we present the crystal structure of the diguanylate cyclase WspR. a conserved GGDEF domain-containing response regulator in Gram-negative bacteria. bound to c-di-GMP at an inhibitory site. Biochemical analyses revealed that feedback regulation involves the formation of at least three distinct oligomeric states. By switching from an active to a product-inhibited dimer via a tetrameric assembly. WspR utilizes a novel mechanism for modulation of its activity through oligomerization. Moreover. our data suggest that these enzymes can be activated by phosphodiesterases. Thus. in addition to the canonical pathways via phosphorylation of the regulatory domains. both product and enzyme concentration contribute to the coordination of c-di-GMP signaling.

Although small RNA biogenesis pathways are well studied. mechanisms for removal of guide RNAs from Argonaute are poorly understood. Here we show that the Argonaute2 (Ago2) guide RNA complex is extremely stable. with a half-life on the order of days. However. highly complementary target RNAs destabilize the complex and significantly accelerate release of the guide RNA from Ago2. This “unloading” activity can be enhanced by mismatches between the target and the guide 5′ end and attenuated by mismatches to the guide 3′ end. The introduction of 3′ mismatches leads to more potent silencing of abundant mRNAs in mammalian cells. These findings help to explain why the 3′ ends of mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) rarely match their targets. suggest a mechanism for sequence-specific …,True,ZLCoHRgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,100,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276513002827,651655465222584661,/scholar?cites=651655465222584661,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276513002827,0,0,0

Organosolv lignin (Lig) is used for the production of composite coatings. and these composites were examined in this study. Titanium substrate is a key biomedical material due to its well-known properties. but infections of the implantation site still impose a serious threat. One approach to prevent infection is to improve antimicrobial properties of the coating material. Silver doped hydroxyapatite (Ag/HAP) and HAP coatings on titanium were obtained by an electrophoretic deposition method in order to control deposited coating mass and morphology by varying applied voltage and deposition time. The effect of lignin on microstructure. morphology and thermal behavior of biocomposite coatings was investigated.

The corrosion stability was evaluated in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 C. Newly formed plate-shaped carbonate-HAP was detected. indicating enhanced bioactive performance. The antimicrobial efficiency of Ag/HAP/Lig was confirmed by its higher reduction of bacteria Staphylococcus aureus TL (S. aureus TL) than of HAP/Lig coating.

The prototypical and homonymous family member is an Escherichia coli “adaptive response” protein that protects the bacterial genome against alkylation damage. AlkB has a wide variety of substrates. including monoalkyl and exocyclic bridged adducts. Nine mammalian AlkB homologs exist (ALKBH1–8. FTO). but only a subset functions as DNA/RNA repair enzymes.

In DNA. spontaneous formation of minor tautomers has been speculated to contribute to mutagenic mispairings during DNA replication. whereas in RNA. minor tautomeric forms have been proposed to enhance the structural and functional diversity of RNA enzymes and aptamers. This review summarizes the role of tautomerism in RNA biochemistry. specifically focusing on the role of tautomerism in catalysis of small self-cleaving ribozymes and recognition of ligand analogs by riboswitches. Considering that the presence of multiple tautomers of nucleic acid bases is a rare occurrence. and that tautomers typically interconvert on a fast time scale. methods for studying rapid tautomerism in the context of nucleic acids under biologically relevant aqueous conditions are …,True,g8-jvgUAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,71,https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/21/1/1.short,14870928095101934566,/scholar?cites=14870928095101934566,,https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/21/1/1.full.pdf,0,0,0

Mate recognition has been extensively studied within the Lepidoptera. where the production and recognition of species-specific sex pheromone signals are typically the defining character. While the specific blend of compounds that makes up the sex pheromones of many species has been characterized. the molecular mechanisms underpinning the evolution of pheromone-based mate recognition systems remain largely unknown. We have focused on two sets of sibling species within the leafroller moth genera Ctenopseustis and Planotortrix that have rapidly evolved the use of distinct sex pheromone blends. The compounds within these blends differ almost exclusively in the relative position of double bonds that are introduced by desaturase enzymes. Of the six desaturase orthologs isolated from all four species. functional analyses in yeast and gene expression in pheromone glands implicate three in pheromone biosynthesis. two Δ9-desaturases. and a Δ10-desaturase. while the remaining three desaturases include a Δ6-desaturase. a terminal desaturase. and a non-functional desaturase.

We report here that the levels of constituents of the Nup107-160 complex are coordinately cell cycle-regulated. At mitosis. however. a member of the complex. Nup96. is preferentially downregulated. This occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. When the levels of Nup96 are kept high. a significant delay in G1/S progression occurs. Conversely. in cells of Nup96+/− mice. which express low levels of Nup96. cell cycle progression is accelerated.

1044663,Unraveling the Golgi ribbon,2010,Jen‐Hsuan Wei and Joachim Seemann,11,,11,1391-1400,Blackwell Publishing Ltd, The Golgi apparatus lies at the heart of the secretory pathway where it receives. modifies and sorts protein cargo to the proper intracellular or extracellular location. Although this secretory function is highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. the structure of the Golgi complex is arranged very differently among species. In particular. Golgi membranes in vertebrate cells are integrated into a single compact entity termed the Golgi ribbon that is normally localized in the perinuclear area and in close vicinity to the centrosomes. This organization poses a challenge for cell division when the single Golgi ribbon needs to be partitioned into the two daughter cells. To ensure faithful inheritance in the progeny. the Golgi ribbon is divided in three consecutive steps in mitosis. namely disassembly. partitioning and reassembly.

Among them. the contributions of centrosomes. chromosomes. and microtubules have been well studied. yet the involvement of membrane-bound organelles remains largely elusive. Here. we provide mechanistic evidence for a membrane-based. Golgi-derived microtubule assembly pathway in mitosis. Upon mitotic entry. the Golgi matrix protein GM130 interacts with importin α via a classical nuclear localization signal that recruits importin α to the Golgi membranes. Sequestration of importin α by GM130 liberates the spindle assembly factor TPX2. which activates Aurora-A kinase and stimulates local microtubule nucleation.

We have used the Golgi stacking protein GRASP65 as a tool to modify the stacking state of Golgi cisternae. We established an assay to measure protein transport to the cell surface in post-mitotic cells in which the Golgi was unstacked. Cells with an unstacked Golgi showed a higher transport rate compared to cells with stacked Golgi membranes. Vesicle budding from unstacked cisternae in vitro was significantly increased compared to stacked membranes. These results suggest that Golgi cisternal stacking can directly regulate vesicle formation and thus the rate of protein transport through the Golgi. The results further suggest that at the onset of mitosis. unstacking of cisternae allows extensive and rapid vesiculation of the Golgi in preparation for its subsequent partitioning.,True,kronwuIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,70,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001647,4040107606876793961,/scholar?cites=4040107606876793961,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001647,0,0,0

Mitotic Golgi membranes concentrate around the spindle poles. suggesting that the spindle may control Golgi partitioning. To test this. cells were induced to divide asymmetrically with the entire spindle segregated into only one daughter cell. A ribbon reforms in the nucleated karyoplasts. whereas the Golgi stacks in the cytoplasts are scattered. However. the scattered Golgi stacks are polarized and transport cargo. Microinjection of Golgi extract together with tubulin or incorporation of spindle materials rescues Golgi ribbon formation. Therefore. the factors required for postmitotic Golgi ribbon assembly are transferred by the spindle. but the constituents of functional stacks are partitioned independently. suggesting that Golgi inheritance is regulated by two distinct mechanisms.,True,kronwuIAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,50,https://rupress.org/jcb/article/184/3/391/35153,8494045740234228727,/scholar?cites=8494045740234228727,,https://rupress.org/jcb/article/184/3/391/35153,0,0,0

Golgi stacks in mammalian cells are interconnected into a compact ribbon in the perinuclear region.

After sterol depletion. the proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus. where they are cleaved by site‐1 protease (S1P). Cleavage releases the active transcription factors. which then enter the nucleus to induce genes that regulate cellular levels of cholesterol and phospholipids. This regulation depends on the spatial separation of the Golgi and the ER. as mixing of the compartments induces unregulated activation of SREBPs. Here. we show that S1P is localized to the Golgi. but cycles continuously through the ER and becomes trapped when ER exit is inhibited. During mitosis.

Two kinds of complexes are evidenced. The higher affinity ATP–FME complex corresponds to a stacking of the two aromatic molecules and leads to a strong hypochromicity of the absorption spectrum of the dye. The lower affinity (ATP)2–FME complex results in a strong increase of the fluorescence intensity (∼20-fold). due mainly to the appearance of the anionic form of FME. as shown by the important red shift (60 nm) of both excitation and emission spectra.

The Ca2+ 1 accumulating capacity of mitochondria (350 nmol per mg of protein) markedly exceeds that of sarcolemmal vesicles (30 nmol per mg of protein). Using a Ca2+-EGTA buffer. it was found that the affinity of ionized Ca for the mitochondrial transport system (Km= 5.69 microM) is higher than that for the Na+-Ca2+ system of sarcolemma exchange (Km= 30 microM). but is markedly lower than that for the Mg2+. ATP-dependent Ca2+ efflux (Km= 0.35 microM). A kinetic analysis demonstrated that the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump is incapable of causing complete relaxation of the smooth muscle within the physiologically significant time. whereas the Ca2+ transport system of mitochondria evokes this process within 21 s. However. the contribution of the Ca2+ pump to the regulation of the Ca2+ content in myocytes is paralleled with the accumulation of Ca2+ in mitochondria and is realized at low concentrations of this cation in the myoplasm. ie. at late steps of relaxation. A mechanism of Ca2+ control over myometrium relaxation is proposed. The system of non-electrogenic Na+-Ca2+ exchange maintains Ca2+ concentration in the myoplasm as high as 10 (-5) M. Mitochondria which accumulate the bulk of Ca2+ rapidly decrease its concentration in the cytoplasm down to 10 (-6)-10 (-7) M; at these values. the activity of the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump with a high affinity for the transfer substrate is manifested.

Extremophiles are defined by the environmental conditions in which they grow optimally. The organisms may be described as acidophilic (optimal growth between pH 1 and pH 5); alkaliphilic (optimal growth above pH 9); halophilic (optimal growth in environments with high concentrations of salt); thermophilic (optimal growth between 60 and 80 C); hyperthermophilic (optimal growth above 80 C); psychrophilic (optimal growth at 15 C or lower. with a maximum tolerant temperature of 20 C and minimal growth at or below 0 C); piezophilic. or barophilic (optimal growth at high hydrostatic pressure); oligotrophic (growth in nutritionally limited environments); endolithic (growth within rock or within pores of mineral grains); and xerophilic (growth in dry conditions. with low water availability). Some extremophiles are adapted simultaneously to multiple stresses (polyextremophile); common examples include thermoacidophiles and haloalkaliphiles. Extremophiles are of biotechnological interest. as they produce extremozymes. defined as enzymes that are functional under extreme conditions. Extremozymes are useful in industrial production procedures and research applications because of their ability to remain active under the severe conditions typically employed in these processes. The study of extremophiles provides an understanding of the physicochemical parameters defining life on Earth and may provide insight into how life on Earth originated.

How these immune receptors detect effectors remains poorly understood. Here we describe the structural basis for direct recognition of AVR-Pik. an effector from the rice blast pathogen. by the rice intracellular NLR immune receptor Pik. AVR-PikD binds a dimer of the Pikp-1 HMA integrated domain with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex enabled design of mutations to alter protein interaction in yeast and in vitro. and perturb effector-mediated response both in a rice cultivar containing Pikp and upon expression of AVR-PikD and Pikp in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. These data reveal the molecular details of a recognition event. mediated by a novel integrated domain in an NLR. which initiates a plant immune response and resistance to rice blast disease.

The ubiquitin-like protein ATG8 is a central player of the autophagy network that decorates autophagosomes and binds to numerous cargo receptors. Although highly conserved across eukaryotes. ATG8 diversified from a single protein in algae to multiple isoforms in higher plants. We present a phylogenetic overview of 376 ATG8 proteins across the green plant lineage that revealed family-specific ATG8 clades. Because these clades differ in fixed amino acid polymorphisms. they provide a mechanistic framework to test whether distinct ATG8 clades are functionally specialized.

1044740,Regulation of interactions with sliding clamps during DNA replication and repair,2009,Francisco J López de Saro,10,Current genomics,3,206,Bentham Science Publishers,The molecular machines that replicate the genome consist of many interacting components. Essential to the organization of the replication machinery are ring-shaped proteins. like PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) or the β- clamp. collectively named sliding clamps. They encircle the DNA molecule and slide on it freely and bidirectionally. Sliding clamps are typically associated to DNA polymerases and provide these enzymes with the processivity required to synthesize large chromosomes. Additionally. they interact with a large array of proteins that perform enzymatic reactions on DNA. targeting and orchestrating their functions. In recent years there have been a large number of studies that have analyzed the structural details of how sliding clamps interact with their ligands.

1044741,Large-Scale Genomic Analysis Suggests a Neutral Punctuated Dynamics of Transposable Elements in Bacterial Genomes,2014,Jaime Iranzo and Manuel J Gómez and Francisco J López de Saro and Susanna Manrubia,10,PLOS Computational Biology,6,e1003680,Public Library of Science,Insertion sequences (IS) are the simplest and most abundant form of transposable DNA found in bacterial genomes. When present in multiple copies. it is thought that they can promote genomic plasticity and genetic exchange. thus being a major force of evolutionary change. The main processes that determine IS content in genomes are. though. a matter of debate. In this work. we take advantage of the large amount of genomic data currently available and study the abundance distributions of 33 IS families in 1811 bacterial chromosomes. This allows us to test simple models of IS dynamics and estimate their key parameters by means of a maximum likelihood approach. We evaluate the roles played by duplication. lateral gene transfer. deletion and purifying selection. We find that the observed IS abundances are compatible with a neutral scenario where IS proliferation is controlled by deletions instead of purifying selection. Even if there may be some cases driven by selection. neutral behavior dominates over large evolutionary scales. According to this view. IS and hosts tend to coexist in a dynamic equilibrium state for most of the time. Our approach also allows for a detection of recent IS expansions. and supports the hypothesis that rapid expansions constitute transient events—punctuations—during which the state of coexistence of IS and host becomes perturbated.,True,gp44BPwAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,28,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003680,15624562584714799332,/scholar?cites=15624562584714799332,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003680,0,0,0

Recently discovered mutations in ATPase motifs can lead to the multi-system disorder Singleton-Merten Syndrome (SMS) and increased interferon levels. suggesting misregulated signaling by RIG-I. Here we report that SMS mutations phenocopy a mutation that allows ATP binding but prevents hydrolysis. ATPase deficient RIG-I constitutively signals through endogenous RNA and co-purifies with self-RNA even from virus infected cells. Biochemical studies and cryo-electron microscopy identify a 60S ribosomal expansion segment as a dominant self-RNA that is stably bound by ATPase deficient RIG-I. ATP hydrolysis displaces wild-type RIG-I from this self-RNA but not from 5' triphosphate dsRNA.

1044776,Organic acids: the pools of fixed carbon involved in redox regulation and energy balance in higher plants,2016,Abir U Igamberdiev and Alexander T Eprintsev,7,,,1042,Frontiers,Organic acids are synthesized in plants as a result of the incomplete oxidation of photosynthetic products and represent the stored pools of fixed carbon accumulated due to different transient times of conversion of carbon compounds in metabolic pathways. When redox level in the cell increases. e.g.. in conditions of active photosynthesis. the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in mitochondria is transformed to a partial cycle supplying citrate for the synthesis of 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate (citrate valve). while malate is accumulated and participates in the redox balance in different cell compartments (via malate valve). This results in malate and citrate frequently being the most accumulated acids in plants. However. the intensity of reactions linked to the conversion of these compounds can cause preferential accumulation of other organic acids. e.g.. fumarate or isocitrate. in higher concentrations than malate and citrate. The secondary reactions. associated with the central metabolic pathways. in particularly with the TCA cycle. result in accumulation of other organic acids that are derived from the intermediates of the cycle. They form the additional pools of fixed carbon and stabilize the TCA cycle.

The interfacial adsorption of dog gastric lipase (DGL) was monitored as a function of pH and surface pressure (Π). independently from the catalytic activity. using non-hydrolysable 1.2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) monomolecular films. The acid-stable DGL. which initiates fat digestion in the stomach. was then selected because its adsorption kinetics onto hydrophobic solid surfaces were already studied. This gastric lipase was therefore used as a model enzyme to validate both experimental and theoretical approaches.

NJ,Calorie restriction is the most powerful method currently known to delay aging-associated disease and extend lifespan. Use of this technique in combination with genetic models has led to identification of key metabolic regulators of lifespan. Limiting energy availability by restricting caloric intake leads to redistribution of energy expenditure and storage. The signaling required for these metabolic changes is mediated in part by the sirtuins at both the posttranslational and transcriptional levels. and consequently. sirtuins are recognized as instigating factors in the regulation of lifespan. This family of class III protein deacetylases is responsible for directing energy regulation based on NAD+ availability.

Promising vaccine candidates utilize proteins. or their genes. from microneme organelle of T. gondii that are involved in the initial stages of host cell invasion by the parasite. In the present study. we used different recombinant microneme proteins (TgMIC1. TgMIC4. or TgMIC6) or combinations of these proteins (TgMIC1-4 and TgMIC1-4-6) to evaluate the immune response and protection against experimental toxoplasmosis in C57BL/6 mice. Vaccination with recombinant TgMIC1. TgMIC4. or TgMIC6 alone conferred partial protection. as demonstrated by reduced brain cyst burden and mortality rates after challenge. Immunization with TgMIC1-4 or TgMIC1-4-6 vaccines provided the most effective protection. since 70% and 80% of mice. respectively. survived to the acute phase of infection. In addition. these vaccinated mice. in comparison to non-vaccinated ones. showed reduced parasite burden by 59% and 68%. respectively. The protective effect was related to the cellular and humoral immune responses induced by vaccination and included the release of Th1 cytokines IFN-γ and IL-12. antigen-stimulated spleen cell proliferation. and production of antigen-specific serum antibodies. Our results demonstrate that microneme proteins are potential vaccines against T. gondii. since their inoculation prevents or decreases the deleterious effects of the infection.,True,CXemZzQAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,42,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143087,13250546120131166604,/scholar?cites=13250546120131166604,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143087,0,0,0

The increase in the global population has entailed an increase in the demand for agriculture in recent decades. Accordingly. there has been worldwide pressure to find means to improve the quality and productivity of agricultural crops. Antifungal agents have been widely used as an alternative for managing fungal diseases affecting several crops. However. the unregulated use of antifungals can jeopardize public health. Application of fungicides in agriculture should be under strict regulation to ensure the toxicological safety of commercialized foods.

This pathogen is commonly associated with bloody diarrhea that can evolve to the lifethreatening hemolytic uremic syndrome. Animals are the natural reservoir where this pathogen remains asymptomatically. in steps of ingestion and colonization of the bowel. The bacterium is shed in the feces. contaminating the surroundings. including water and food that are directed for human consumption. A major player in this colonization process is intimin. an outer membrane adhesion molecule encoded by theE. coli attachment and effacement (eae) gene that has been shown to be essential for intimate bacterial attachment to eukaryotic host cells. In an attempt to reduce the colonization of animal reservoirs with EHEC O157: H7. we designed a vaccine model to induce an immune response against intimin gamma. The model is based on its recombinant expression in attenuated Salmonella. used as a suitable vaccine vector because of its recognized ability to deliver recombinant antigens and to elicit all forms of immunity: mucosal. systemic. and humoral responses. To test this model. mice were orally immunized with a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain carrying the pYA3137eaeA vector. and challenged with E. coliO157: H7. Here we show that immunization induced the production of high levels of specific IgG and IgA antibodies and promoted reduction in the fecal shedding of EHEC after challenge.

For the export of several biomolecules in diverse species. the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is considered to represent an alternative transport mechanism. but no study to date has investigated EVs from dermatophytes. Here. we describe biologically active EVs from the dermatophyte Trichophyton interdigitale. a causative agent of mycoses worldwide. EV preparations from T. interdigitale were examined using nanoparticle-tracking analysis. which revealed vesicular structures 20–380 nm in diameter. These vesicles induced the production of proinflammatory mediators by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner. and an addition of the EVs to BMDMs also stimulated the transcription of the M1-polarization marker iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and diminished the expression of the M2 markers arginase-1 and Ym-1. The observed M1 macrophages’ polarization triggered by EVs was abolished in cells obtained from knockout Toll-like receptor-2 mice. Also. the EVs-induced productions of pro-inflammatory mediators were blocked too. Furthermore. the EVs from T. interdigitale enhanced the fungicidal activity of BMDMs. These results suggest that EVs from T. interdigitale can modulate the innate immune response of the host and influence the interaction between T. interdigitale and host immune cells.

Thus. metallation of an estimated 30% of metalloenzymes is aided by metal delivery systems. with ∼25% acquiring preassembled metal cofactors. The remaining ∼70% are presumed to compete for metals from buffered metal pools. Metallation is further aided by maintaining the relative concentrations of these pools as an inverse function of the stabilities of the respective metal complexes.

Salmonella serovars continue to cause serious medical and veterinary problems worldwide and detecting deficiency and excess of different metal ions (such as copper. iron. zinc. manganese. nickel. and cobalt) is fundamental to their virulence. This involves multiple DNA-binding metal-responsive transcription factors that discriminate between elements and trigger expression of genes that mediate appropriate responses to metal fluxes.

This delay resulted from a defect in C-strand fill-in. Short telomeres exhibited the fill-in defect but normal telomere duplex replication. indicating that STN1/CST functions independently in these processes.

This class I molecule has been shown to be an N-formyl peptide receptor. Although the N-formyl moiety is necessary for binding to M3a. it is not sufficient. We proposed that the R group of the amino acid in position 1 plays a pivotal role in peptide binding to M3a. To test this hypothesis. analogues differing in size and stereospecificity of the R group were synthesized. Substitutions with other hydrophobic amino acids such as N-formyl phenylalanine and N-formyl valine had no significant effect on the ability of these Mtf alpha analogues to sensitize target cells (M3a.

In acute lung injury-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI-ARDS) several distinct isoenzymes appear in lung cells and fluid. Some are capable to trigger molecular events leading to enhanced inflammation and lung damage and others have a role in lung surfactant recycling preserving lung function: Secreted forms (groups sPLA2-IIA. -V. -X) can directly hydrolyze surfactant phospholipids. Cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2-IVA) requiring Ca2+ has a preference for arachidonate. the precursor of eicosanoids which participate in the inflammatory response in the lung. Ca2+-independent intracellular PLA2s (iPLA2) take part in surfactant phospholipids turnover within alveolar cells.
