10096872,Obesity: preventing and managing the global epidemic,2000,World Health Organization,,,894,,World Health Organization,"This report issues a call for urgent action to combat the growing epidemic of obesity. which now affects developing and industrialized countries alike. Adopting a public health approach. the report responds to both the enormity of health problems associated with obesity and the notorious difficulty of treating this complex. multifactorial disease. With these problems in mind. the report aims to help policy-makers introduce strategies for prevention and management that have the greatest chance of success. The importance of prevention as the most sensible strategy in developing countries. where obesity coexists with undernutrition. is repeatedly emphasized. Recommended lines of action. which reflect the consensus reached by 25 leading authorities. are based on a critical review of current scientific knowledge about the causes of obesity in both individuals and populations. While all causes are considered. major attention is given to behavioural and societal changes that have increased the energy density of diets. overwhelmed sophisticated regulatory systems that control appetite and maintain energy balance. and reduced physical activity. Specific topics discussed range from the importance of fat content in the food supply as a cause of population-wide obesity. through misconceptions about obesity held by both the medical profession and the public. to strategies for dealing with the alarming prevalence of obesity in children.""... the volume is clearly written. and carries a wealth of summary information that is likely to be invaluable for anyone interested in the public health aspects of obesity and fatness. be they students. practitioner or researcher."" …",True,lzdgBesAAAAJ:LSFECYNo2dQC,21548,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=AvnqOsqv9doC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:n0l5wuBL9AQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=6WE2cs-Y9H&sig=N78rgFewJs8kI9SGabX1TcdMpEc,356993699176597919,/scholar?cites=356993699176597919,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=AvnqOsqv9doC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:n0l5wuBL9AQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=6WE2cs-Y9H&sig=N78rgFewJs8kI9SGabX1TcdMpEc,0,0,0

Pregnant and lactating women should aim to achieve an average daily intake of at least 200 mg DHA. For healthy term infants. we recommend and fully endorse breastfeeding. which supplies preformed LC-PUFA. as the preferred method of feeding. When breastfeeding is not possible. we recommend use of an infant formula providing DHA at levels between 0.2 and 0.5 weight percent of total fat. and with the minimum amount of AA equivalent to the contents of DHA.

A recent WHO/PAHO survey on obesity in the region revealed an increasing trend in obesity as countries emerge from poverty. especially in urban areas. In contrast. in middle income countries. obesity tends to decline as income increases; this is especially so in women. Dietary changes and increasing inactivity are considered the crucial contributory factors that explain this rise. The end result is a progressive rise in overweight and obesity. especially in low income groups who improve their income and buy high fat/high carbohydrate energy-dense foods.

10096888,Arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids are biosynthesized from their 18-carbon precursors in human infants,1996,Norman Salem and Brent Wegher and Patricia Mena and Ricardo Uauy,93,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,1,49-54,National Academy of Sciences,It is becoming clear that an adequate level of long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids in the nervous system is required for optimal function and development; however. the ability of infants to biosynthesize long-chain fatty acids is unknown. This study explores the capacity of human infants to convert 18-carbon essential fatty acids to their elongated and desaturated forms. in vivo. A newly developed gas chromatography/negative chemical ionization/mass spectrometry method employing 2H-labeled essential fatty acids allowed assessment of this in vivo conversion with very high sensitivity and selectivity. Our results demonstrate that human infants have the capacity to convert dietary essential fatty acids administered enterally as 2H-labeled ethyl esters to their longer-chain derivatives. transport them to plasma. and incorporate them into membrane lipids.

The pathogenesis of NEC is associated with an excessive inflammatory IL-8 response. In this study. we hypothesized that this excessive inflammatory response is related to an immature expression of innate immune response genes. To address this hypothesis. intestinal RNA expression analysis of innate immune response genes was performed after laser capture microdissection of resected ileal epithelium from fetuses. NEC patients and children and confirmed in ex vivo human intestinal xenografts. Changes in mRNA levels of toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and -4. their signaling molecules and transcription factors (MyD88. TRAF-6 and NFκB1) and negative regulators (SIGIRR. IRAK-M. A-20 and TOLLIP) and the effector IL-8 were characterized by qRT-PCR. The expression of TLR2. TLR4. MyD88. TRAF-6. NFκB1 and IL-8 mRNA was increased while SIGIRR. IRAK-M. A-20 and TOLLIP mRNA were decreased in fetal vs. mature human enterocytes and further altered in NEC enterocytes. Similar changes in mRNA expression were observed in immature. but not mature. human intestinal xenografts. Confirmation of gene expression was also validated with selective protein measurements and with suggested evidence that immature TRL4 enterocyte surface expression was internalized in mature enterocytes.

In transitional countries. stunting (shortness for age) and micronutrient deficiencies (iron. vitamin A. and zinc) in children coexist with obesity and NRCDs originating the double burden of nutritional disease. The causal web for obesity and NRCDs is complex and multifaceted; changes in diet and physical activity of the population are likely the main concurrent determinant factors.

Karger AG,Over recent decades interest in lipid nutrition has focused on the role of essential lipids in central nervous system development. and of specific fatty acids and cholesterol in lipoprotein metabolism. The impact of fats and fatty acids on the development of nutrition related chronic diseases throughout the life course has also received considerable attention. Lipids are structural components of all tissues and are indispensable for the assembly of membranes and cell organelles. The brain. retina and other neural tissues are particularly rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPs). Some LCPs derived from the n–6 and n–3 EFAs are precursors for eicosanoid and docosanoid production (prostaglandins. prostacyclins. thromboxanes. leukotrienes. resolvins and neuroprotectins).

It involves both genetic and environmental influences and is associated with> 40 different medical and psychological problems. Thus. obesity places an enormous social and economic burden on most societies. making it the most important nutritional disease in developed countries. The continuous variations in height and relative muscle mass show that obesity cannot be evaluated by weight measures alone. particularly in the case of children and adolescents. Body mass index (BMI; weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is a useful measure of adiposity because it accounts for variations in height. Availability and palatability of food and low levels of physical activity are frequently associated with increasing obesity in most populations.

Design: Validation cohort study. Setting: University-based. tertiary care neonatal ICUs. Patients: Sample of 3.603 infants with birth weights of 501 to 1500 grams who were born at seven National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) Neonatal Research Network Centers. over a 2-yr period of time. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Based on logistic regression analysis. admission factors associated with mortality risk for inborn infants were: decreasing birth weight. appropriate size for gestational age. male gender. non-black race. and 1-min Apgar score of≤ 3. The mortality prediction model based on these factors had a sensitivity of 0.50. a specificity of 0.92. a correct classification rate of 0.82. and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 when applied to a validation sample. Goodness-of-fit testing showed that there was a marginal degree of fit between the observations and model predictions (χ 2= 15.4. p=. 06). The observed mortality rate for 3.603 infants at the seven centers was 24.7%. ranging from 21.8% to 27.7% at individual centers.

Human milk. in which most of the energy is present as fat. provides a relatively high cholesterol intake. Formula provides a much lower cholesterol intake. Infants fed human milk have higher total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in plasma than do formula-fed infants (P < 0.05). whereas plasma HDL- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations are lower in formula-fed infants if a formula high in linoleate is fed (P < 0.05). Infants adapt to the high cholesterol content of human milk through a decrease in cholesterol synthesis; in contrast. the addition of cholesterol to formula does not suppress synthesis.

The evidence for chronic toxicity is derived principally from patients with Wilson disease and cases of infantile cirrhosis that were related to excessive copper intakes. The evaluation of the safety of a nutrient requires toxicologic studies to determine the limits of safe exposure. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is calculated by determining the highest no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). When it is not possible to identify the NOAEL. the lowest observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) may be used.

The basic mechanisms underlying these proposed benefits have been postulated and experimental studies supporting the plausibility of the putative effects have been published. Observational epidemiological and case control studies also largely support a protective role of fish consumption on cognitive function with advancing age. albeit with important unexplained heterogeneity in findings. In this review we report the findings of the latest Cochrane review on the benefits of n-3 LCP supplementation on cognitive function among cognitively healthy older people and expand the review by including trials conducted with individuals with prevalent poor cognitive function or dementia.

In this study. fatty acid profiles of red blood cells (RBC) were used as an index for LCPUFA metabolism in patients with XLRP because RBC lipids reflect membrane-associated fatty acids. Correlations between LCPUFA content and electroretinographic (ERG) function were assessed. METHODS: Mean ages for the XLRP group (n= 18) and control group (n= 28) were 22+/-18 years and 24+/-16 years. respectively. Electroretinographic assessment included the International Society for the Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision standard protocol. Methyl esters of RBC fatty acids were analyzed by capillary column gas chromatography. RESULTS: The content of the omega 3 fatty acid. docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). was 40% lower in the group with XLRP (23.1+/-5.9 micrograms/ml RBC [mean+/-1 SD]) than in normal subjects (38.6+/-9.4 micrograms/ml RBC. t= 6.24. P< 0.0001). Total omega 3 LCPUFA content in patients with XLRP was reduced by 30% from normal levels compared to a 10% reduction in omega 6 LCPUFA levels. Elongation reactions for omega 3. omega 6. saturated fatty acids. and monounsaturated fatty acids were markedly lower for patients with XLRP than for normal subjects.

10097022,Marine oils as a source of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet: how to optimize the health benefits.,1992,R Uauy-Dagach and A Valenzuela,16,,3,199-243,,Marine oils are receiving increasing attention as a source of C 20 and C 22 carbon omega-3 polyenoic fatty acids. The provision of preformed EPA and DHA from marine oils has profound implications for health and disease. Their role as precursors for the synthesis of eicosanoids and docosanoids explains many of the multisystemic effects observed when they are administered. Furthermore under some physiologic conditions such as preterm birth the evidence suggests that C 18 omega-3 fatty acids are not sufficiently converted to DHA to allow for biochemical and functional normalcy. thus DHA may be considered a conditionally essential nutrient for normal eye and brain development. Under disease conditions EPA plays a major role in modifying the balance between omega-6 and omega-3 derived eicosanoids thus modulating related functions. The use of marine oils has some potential risks that can be circumvented by careful processing. storing and preserving the unsaturated fatty acids. Technological procedures based on chemical and physical separation of the unsaturated fatty acids has permitted the elaboration of concentrated EPA and DHA for clinical testing. The development of structured lipids has allowed the synthesis of novel forms of EPA and DHA delivery. Further uses of marine oil to optimize health and prevent disease are predicted based on recent knowledge and technological developments.,True,lzdgBesAAAAJ:pbxU2-Kz4GsC,72,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1438808,6247957231427319649,/scholar?cites=6247957231427319649,,,0,0,0

A critical problem in some food fortification programs is the lack of bioavailability of iron compounds. This article reviews presentations on iron fortification programs in the Americas and the technical and practical barriers faced by the programs. Effective programmatic strategies will incorporate systematic consideration of sound program management. ensure consumption of fortified foods. and promote advocacy and supportive legislation. However. these factors are often overlooked or are not addressed coherently. Key components to consider in implementation of iron fortification programs include: utilization of foods and condiments containing fortificants that are bioavailable; program development and its implementation coordinated with targeted communications; utilizing resources from public/private sector partnerships …,True,lzdgBesAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC,70,https://academic.oup.com/jn/article-abstract/132/4/849S/4687272,17134370436032911149,/scholar?cites=17134370436032911149,,https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/132/4/849S/4687272,0,0,0

To explore the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on gene expression during human fetal retinal maturation.methods. Human fetal retinal explants were cultured in serum-free Waymouth’s medium supplemented with DHA or oleic acid (OA). using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the vehicle. After 14 days in culture. fatty acid composition was assessed. and the abundance of 2400 cDNAs was examined with a human cDNA microarray system.results. Transcript abundance remained unchanged for 82% and 90% of genes in the explants with added DHA or OA. respectively. Decreased expression was detected in 4% and 9% of genes. in explants supplemented with DHA or OA. respectively. whereas. 14% of genes in explants exposed to DHA and only 0.4% of genes in explants treated with OA showed increased expression. Transcripts displaying changes in abundance in explants supplemented with DHA encode for proteins involved in diverse biological functions. including neurogenesis. neurotransmission. and refinement of connectivity. These gene expression changes were not observed in explants supplemented with OA.conclusions. The effect of DHA deficiency on retinal function during human development can be partly explained by modifications in retinal gene expression by direct or indirect mechanisms.,True,lzdgBesAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC,68,https://arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2182044,16807023664098764376,/scholar?cites=16807023664098764376,,https://arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2182044,0,0,0
