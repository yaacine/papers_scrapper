However. the identity. functions. and the factors that influence the association of bacterial endophytes with desert plants are poorly known. These bacterial endophytes can be used as an untapped resource to favor plant growth and development in agro-ecosystems of arid regions. The present study is therefore focused on the isolation and identification of bacterial endophytes from two native medicinal plants (Fagonia mollis Delile and Achillea fragrantissima (Forssk) Sch. Bip.) growing spontaneously in the arid region of the South Sinai (Egypt). and characterization of their plant growth promoting (PGP) traits. Thirteen putative bacterial endophytes were isolated from the leaves of both plant species and characterized for their plant growth promoting abilities using molecular and biochemical approaches. as well as greenhouse trials. Selected endophytic bacterial strains were applied to maize plants (Zea mays L. var. Single cross Pioneer 30K08) to further evaluate their PGP abilities under greenhouse conditions. Isolated bacterial strains have variable plant growth promoting activities. Among these activities. isolated bacterial endophytes have the efficacy of phosphate solubilizing with clear zones ranging from 7.6±0.3 to 9.6±0.3 mm.

Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and chitosan both play an important role in combating salinity stress and improving plant growth under adverse environmental conditions. The present study aimed to evaluate the impacts of PGPR and chitosan on the growth of sweet pepper plant grown under different salinity regimes. For this purpose. two pot experiments were conducted in 2019 and 2020 to evaluate the role of PGPR (Bacillus thuringiensis MH161336 10 6–8 CFU/cm 3) applied as seed treatment and foliar application of chitosan (30 mg dm− 3) on sweet pepper plants (cv.

We determined droplet penetration and characterization of a pyrethroid adulticide applied from the ground at mid (46.77 ml/ha) and maximum (93.53 ml/ha) label rates within cryptic habitats of urban and suburban environments. Droplets were collected from all habitats. with no significant differences detected between locations within the same application rate or collection method. No differences were detected in droplet densities (drops per mm2) between rates within urban environments. but more droplets were collected in urban (149.93 ± 11.07 SE) than suburban sites (114.37 ± 11.32) at the maximum label rate (P = 0.003). The excellent penetration of aerosols into cryptic habitats of an urban site was likely due to the shorter spray paths afforded by our network of roads and alleys.

USA. to Ontario. Canada. but has an exceptionally patchy distribution over much of its range. Typical breeding habitat for this univoltine species includes cavities at the bases of trees growing in low-lying swampy areas or dark recesses within the root balls of upturned trees. Larvae have never been collected in the northeastern portion of the range. but adult records suggest that breeding populations are present. The lack of low-lying swampland in northern areas where adults have been collected suggests that the breeding habitat for this species may not be as specific as previously believed. On April 20. 1997. we collectedAe. thibaultilarvae from the flooded cavity of a red maple tree (Acer rubrum) growing next to a temporary snow pool in northern New Jersey.

First Faculty of Medicine,The essential role of MCM 2–7 proteins in the initiation of DNA replication in all eukaryotes is well known. Their role in replication elongation is supported by numerous studies. but there is still a knowledge gap in this respect. Even though biochemical studies have established an association of MCM proteins with replication forks. previous immunofluorescence studies in mammalian cells have suggested that MCM 2–7 proteins are displaced after replication initiation from sites of DNA replication. Therefore. we used a robust statistical method to more precisely analyse immunofluorescence localization of MCM 2 proteins with respect to the DNA replication foci. We show that despite the predominantly different localization of MCM 2 and replication signals. there is still a small but significant fraction of MCM 2 proteins that co-localize with DNA replication foci during most of S phase. The fluorescence localization of the MCM 2 proteins and DNA replication may thus reflect an active function of MCM 2 proteins associated with the replication foci and partially explain one facet of the “MCM paradox”.,True,4SgitMkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,13,https://fb.cuni.cz/file/5579/FB2011A0002.pdf,12990843630298032127,/scholar?cites=12990843630298032127,,https://fb.cuni.cz/file/5579/FB2011A0002.pdf,0,0,0

In particular these genes include the Broad-Complex (BR-C) gene encoding a set of BTB/POZ-transcription factors. among which the Z1 isoform is critical for SG cell death. The timing of SG disappearance depends upon of p127l(2)gl. a cytoskeletal tumor suppressor that interacts with nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain (nmMHC) encoded by the zipper (zip) gene. Reduced l(2)gl expression delays SG histolysis whereas over-expression accelerates this process without affecting larval and pupal development.

Disruption of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. including mutations in PTCH1. define a major subset of human MB. Mice heterozygous for loss of function mutations in the Ptch1 ortholog develop MBs at low frequency. To identity genes that co-operate with Ptch1 in MB development. a Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis screen in this murine model was performed. Mutagenesis significantly increased the frequency of MB formation in Ptch heterozygote mice from ~3% to ~25% after 8 months (p<0.0001). To identify the genes responsible for this enhanced tumour formation. Splinkerette-PCR and 454-FLX sequencing were applied to define SB insertion sites within 40 tumours. Statistical analysis of these data using Monte Carlo and Kernel Convolution methods identified 18 candidate medulloblastoma genes defined by common insertion sites (CISs). including 11 identified by both methods used. Many of these are genes known to be involved in neuronal development and cell fate determination. Subsequent ARACNe network analysis of the candidate genes in human gene expression datasets has established that seven (Nfia. Nfib. Tead1. Tgif2. Myt1l. Fgf13 and Crebbp) lie within a single network which is enriched for both neuronal genes and transcription factors. and includes genes known to interact with the SHH pathway …,True,jlRQV3AAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,http://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/handle/10443/2572,,,,"https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/bitstream/10443/2572/1/Al-Afghani,%20H%202014.pdf",0,0,0

Dominant territorial species are known to restrictively influence the traits of subordinates in various ways. However. there could be diffe rences in the effects of dominants due to differences in their colony structure. lifestyle and also behaviour. We tested this hypothesis in natural circumstances in an area where a Formica exsecta Nyl. supercolony neighbours a strong population of the European slavemaker F. sanguinea Latr. For the purpose of our study three different sites were selected: one dominated by F. exsecta. a neighbouring site dominated by F. sanguinea. and a third site where both species cooccurred. We analyzed the structure of subordinate ant communities based on nest counts. and by recording the activity of ants at baits. Based on our find ings the structure of ant communities differed significantly among the three sites. The F. exsecta site was characterized by the lowest nest density of subordinates. especially in the case of aggressive species as Lasius platythorax Seifert. At baits even the simple presence of the dominant limited the abundance and occur rence of subordinates. In contrast. no such negative effect could be revealed at the F. sanguinea site.

It results in considerable changes in the composition of both plant and animal communities. Ants have many critical roles in the maintenance and functioning of forest ecosystems. Therefore. the response of ants to clear-cutting and the time it takes for an ant community to recover after clearcutting are important indicators of the effect of this harvesting technique on the forest ecosystem. We investigated ground-dwelling ant communities during secondary succession of deciduous forests in Transylvania. Romania. Using space-for-time substitution. we explored a chronosequence from clear-cuts to mature forests (> 120 years). The object was to determine if cutting has measurable effects on ant community structure. and if ant species richness differs between successional stages. We recorded a total of 24 species of ants. 11 characteristic of forests and seven of open landscape. Ant species richness was higher in clear-cuts compared to closed-canopy and old stands. Number of ant individuals was highest in young age classes and lowest in closed-canopy age classes. There was no drastic change in species richness during the succession. however differences in community composition at different stages were recorded. Open landscape species are able to rapidly colonize following disturbance but disappear when the forest sites mature and many forest ant species are capable of surviving clear cutting.,True,adEX25IAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,6,https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/images/5/5f/Tausan%2C_I.%2C_Dauber%2C_J._et_al._2017._Succession_in_ant_communities_%2810.14411%40eje.2017.013%29.pdf,15832851846022693351,/scholar?cites=15832851846022693351,,https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/images/5/5f/Tausan%2C_I.%2C_Dauber%2C_J._et_al._2017._Succession_in_ant_communities_%2810.14411%40eje.2017.013%29.pdf,0,0,0

However. information on the nutritional status of this crop in this soil/climatic zone is scarce. The objective of this work was to use techniques such as geographic information systems (GIS) and geostatistics to generate information that can be used to optimise physical and financial aspects of kiwifruit production systems. A regional survey was conducted over three years (2002-2004) in 15 geo-referenced orchards of Beira Litoral. Soil analysis and fruit production and quality were determined. In order to understand the variation of kiwifruit quality and production factors. graphical interpretation of these properties was done using GIS. geostatistics and principle component analyses (PCA). Ordinary kriging was the geostatistical technique used for creation of prediction maps. which were then introduced into a GIS and their values reclassified. Maps of biophysical characteristics of the region were then related to the generated GIS/geostatistical maps using PCA. Areas with highest potential production and quality were located. Site specific management methods could improve productivity and quality. Those maps can help the producer to make decisions about harvesting time or localized correction of production factors and to choose the best place for vineyard installation in the region. There was a strong correlation between the map of yield and quality factors.

Studies in the last few decades have revealed the significance of histone PTMs in key cellular processes including DNA replication. repair. transcription. apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. The PTMs on histones are carried out by chromatin modifiers. which are reversible in nature. The dynamic activity of chromatin modifiers maintains the levels of different PTMs on histones. The modified histones are recognized by reader proteins. which recruit effector proteins to regulate the function.

Conversion of Asp to iso-Asp is one of the several known oxidant mediated amino acids modifications.

Typhimurium) but act as source of human infection for this bacterium. Inside the poultry. S. Typhimurium experiences several stresses. 42 ºC body temperature of birds is one of them. Proteins are highly susceptible to temperature mediated damage. Conversion of protein bound aspartate (Asp) residues to iso-aspartate (iso-Asp) is one of such modifications that occur at elevated temperature. Iso-Asp formation has been linked to protein inactivation and compromised cellular survival. Protein - L - isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) can repair iso-Asp back to Asp. thus enhances the cellular survival at elevated temperature. Here. we show that the pimt gene deletion strain of S. Typhimurium (∆pimt mutant strain) is hypersensitive to 42 ºC in vitro. The hypersusceptibility of ∆pimt strain is partially reversed by plasmid based complementation (trans-complementation) of ∆pimt strain. Following oral inoculation. ∆pimt strain showed defective colonization in poultry caecum. and compromised dissemination to spleen and liver. Interestingly. we have observed three and half folds induction of the PIMT protein following exposure of S. Typhimurium to 42 ºC. Our data suggest a novel role of pimt gene in the survival of S.

Typhimurium) inside the host. Met residues are highly prone to oxidation and convert into methionine sulfoxide (Met-SO). Methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) can repair Met-SO to Met thus restoring the function(s) of Met-SO containing proteins. Using pull down method we have identified several MsrA interacting proteins in the S. Typhimurium. one of them was malate synthase (MS). MS is an enzyme of glyoxylate cycle. This cycle is essential for survival of S. Typhimurium inside the host under nutrient limiting conditions. By employing in vitro cross-linking and blot overlay techniques we showed that purified MsrA interacted with pure MS. Treatment of pure malate synthase with H2O2 resulted in reduction of MS activity.

However. some multi drug resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are tolerant to many herbal compounds including carvacrol. The tolerance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to carvacrol is not well studied. This study aims to identify the gene(s) associated with carvacrol tolerance thus to understand its mechanisms in P. aeruginosa. Herbal drug resistant MDR strain of P. aeruginosa was isolated from the field samples. Carvacrol sensitive mutant was generated using transposon mutagenesis. The inactivated gene in the mutant was identified as mexA. which is a part of mexA-mexB-oprM efflux pump. Inactivation of mexA gene resulted in 32.5 fold reduction in MIC of carvacrol whereas 80 folds reduction was observed in the presence of PAβN. The organism was completely killed within 3 h of incubation in all combinations of carvacrol and PAβN. Interestingly. mexA inactivation did not affect the tolerance of other herbal compounds used.

Agroforestry has long been proposed as a more sustainable agricultural system. conserving biodiversity while providing significant local livelihoods. In this context. camera traps were deployed to compare communities of large mammals between natural forest (22.272 hours across 24 deployments) and extensively managed coffee forest (19.059 hours. 23 deployments) for the first time in the south-west Ethiopian highlands. Mammal communities in the two forest types were similar in species richness and Shannon diversity but differed in community composition. Significant indicator species of coffee forest were the crested porcupine Hystrix cristata and the Ethiopian hare Lepus fagani. whereas leopards Panthera pardus and civets Civettictis civetta had a preference for natural forest. The number of detections of mammals was higher in coffee forest. where activity patterns were predominantly crepuscular and nocturnal. which may be a direct adaptation to frequent human disturbance. In natural forest. mammal activity peaked during daytime. Despite the high mammal diversity in extensively managed coffee forest. it cannot fully replace natural forest as a habitat for large mammals.

However. DAGs often contain large amounts of redundant or false positive information. leading to difficulties in quantifying and prioritizing potential relationships between these DAGs and human diseases. In this study. a network-oriented gene entropy approach (NOGEA) is proposed for accurately inferring master genes that contribute to specific diseases by quantitatively calculating their perturbation abilities on directed disease-specific gene networks. In addition. we confirmed that the master genes identified by NOGEA have a high reliability for predicting disease-specific initiation events and progression risk. Master genes may also be used to extract the underlying information of different diseases. thus revealing mechanisms of disease comorbidity. More importantly. approved therapeutic targets are topologically localized in a small neighborhood of master genes on the interactome network. which provides a new way for predicting new drug-disease associations. Through this method. 11 old drugs were newly identified and predicted to be effective for treating pancreatic cancer and then validated by in vitro experiments. Collectively. the NOGEA was useful for identifying master genes that control disease initiation and co-occurrence. thus providing a valuable strategy for drug efficacy screening and repositioning.

Among them. we highlight biocontrol agents derived from the fungi genus Trichoderma. which have been documented in limiting the growth of other phytopathogenic fungus in the roots and leaves of several plant species. An important member of this genus is Trichoderma asperelloides. whose biocontrol agents have been used to promote plant growth while also treating soil diseases caused by microorganisms in both greenhouses and outdoor crops. To evaluate the safety of fungal biological agents for human health. tests to detect potentially adverse effects. such as allergenicity. toxicity. infectivity and pathogenicity. are crucial. In addition. identifying possible immunomodulating properties of fungal biocontrol agents merits further investigation. Thus. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of T. asperelloides spores in the internalization of Candida parapsilosis yeast by mice phagocytes. in order to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanism of this interaction. as a model to understand possible in vivo effects of this fungus.

In the leafcutter ant-microbe symbiosis a plethora of filamentous fungi continuously gain access the ant colonies through plant substrate collected by workers. Many filamentous fungi are considered transient in attine ant colonies. however. their real ecological role in this environment still remains unclear. A possible role of these microorganisms is the antagonism towards Leucoagaricus gongylophorus. the mutualistic fungus that serve as food for several leafcutter ant species. Here. we showed the antagonism of filamentous fungi isolated from different sources. and the negative impacts of their metabolites on the growth of the ant-fungal cultivar.

The tumours typically form in the presence of connective tissue and are of key consideration when assessing research priorities for future healthcare management. Ceramidase inhibitors. such as ceranib-2. have demonstrated capacity to interfere with cellular DNA functionality. initiating apoptosis in many cancer cell lines. The enzyme ceramidase can regulate cellular levels of sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate by controlling hydrolysis of ceramide. The present study investigates the antigrowth effects of ceranib-2 on mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH/3T3 normal cell line) and rat embryonic fibroblast cells (5RP7 cancer cell line). Research was conducted using colorimetric 3-(4. 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2. 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. confocal microscopy. and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that in vitro fibrocarcinomas have the potential to undergo apoptotic death when influenced by the antigrowth behaviour of ceranib-2.

In this prospective experimental study. we investigated the potential preventive effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in rats exposed to acoustic trauma (AT). Light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) evaluations were performed.Material and Methods. Healthy Wistar albino rats (n= 18) were divided into 3 groups: group 1 (control group. n= 6). group 2 (acoustic trauma group. n= 6). and group 3 (AT+ NAC group. n= 6). The rats in group 2 were exposed to AT. The rats in group 3 received NAC at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day by gavage for 7 days. and then 10 min after the 7th-day dose. they were exposed to AT.Results. From light and scanning electron microscopy evaluations in the control group. the cochlear structure and epithelium were normal. In group 2 (AT group). extensive hair cell loss was observed in the cochlea by light microscopy evaluation. In the SEM evaluation. various epithelial damage and loss of stereocilia were also observed. In group 3 (AT+ NAC group). decreased damage with preserved cochlear structures was seen by light microscopy. In the SEM evaluation. although stereocilia loss was also seen. nearly normal cell structures and vertical and symmetrical alignment of stereocilia structures were observed compared to the AT group.Conclusion. NAC reduced cochlear damage due to acoustic trauma. Because NAC has antioxidant capacity. AT mat have caused an increase in free radicals and death of outer hair cells.

Nevertheless. these bacteria can be pathogenic to the humans. Due to the increasing occurrence of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus strains. new approaches to control this pathogen are necessary. The antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) process is based in the combined use of light. oxygen and an intermediary agent (a photosensitizer). These three components interact to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species that irreversibly damage vital constituents of the microbial cells and ultimately lead to cell death. Although PDI is being shown to be a promising alternative to the antibiotic approach for the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms. information on effects of photosensitization on particular virulence factors is strikingly scarce. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of PDI on virulence factors of S. aureus and to assess the potential development of resistance of this bacterium as well as the recovery of the expression of the virulence factors after successive PDI cycles.

To reduce the concentration of microorganisms in WW to levels comparable to those found in natural waters. the sewage effluent is usually subjected to disinfection with chlorine. ozone. or ultraviolet light. which may lead to the formation of toxic products and contribute to the selection of resistant genes. Moreover. the changing patterns of infectious diseases and the emerging of multidrug resistant microbial strains entail the development of new technologies for WW decontamination. Microbial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) with photosensitizers. oxygen. and visible light has demonstrated to be effective in the inactivation of microorganisms via photogeneration of reactive oxygen species able to induce microbial damage at the external structures level. The promising results of PDI suggest that this principle can be applied to WW treatment to inactivate microorganisms but also to photodegrade chemical pollutants.

1068488,Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy in the Control of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae Transmission by Kiwifruit Pollen,2020,Margarida M Lopes and Maria Bartolomeu and Ana TPC Gomes and Etelvina Figueira and Ricardo Pinto and Luís Reis and Victor M Balcão and M Amparo F Faustino and M Neves and Adelaide Almeida,8,Microorganisms,7,1022,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) is a phytopathogen responsible for bacterial canker in kiwifruit plants and can be disseminated through pollen. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) in the inactivation of Psa on kiwifruit pollen using New Methylene Blue (NMB) and Methylene Blue (MB) in the presence/absence of potassium iodide (KI). Pollen germination assays were also performed to evaluate if it was affected by aPDT. Higher reduction of Psa was achieved using NMB (5.0 μM) combined with KI (100 mM) in vitro (ca. 8 log CFU mL− 1 after 90 min of irradiation). while NMB alone promoted a lower reduction (3.7 log CFU mL− 1). The most efficient NMB concentration with KI was used to study the photodynamic efficiency of MB (5.0 μM). MB with KI photo-inactivated Psa more efficiently than NMB. causing the same bacterial reduction (ca. 8 log CFU mL− 1) in half the irradiation time (45 min). Therefore. MB was selected for the subsequent ex vivo aPDT assays in pollen. Almost all the Psa cells added artificially to the pollen (3.2 log CFU mL− 1) were photo-inactivated (3.1 log CFU mL− 1). whereas aPDT had a low effect on pollen natural microorganisms. When KI was added. a significant increase in aPDT effectiveness was observed (4.5 log CFU mL− 1). No negative effects were observed in the pollen germination after aPDT. The results show aPDT is an effective and safe method to Psa inactivation on kiwifruit pollen. and MB use is a promising alternative in the control of Psa transmission.

The decrease in DNA concentration observed during the indirect exposure to photosensitization is directly related with the reduction of the concentration of bacterial cells. However.

A better understanding towards the targeted pathogen greatly helps in designing effective control strategy. The fungal growth is greatly influenced by nutritional factors. such as a nitrogen source. carbon source. pH of the substrate and temperature. All these factors play important role in fungal growth. sporulation and other activities of fungi. In effective integrated plant disease management programs. plant growth conditions may be changed to form the unfavorable conditions for the pathogen development. Factors that affect the multiplication and sporulation of pathogenic fungi are numerous. including photo periods. incubation temperature. pH of the growth medium. nutrients in the growth medium. etc. With this aim the present studies on the influence of physiological factors on vegetative growth and sporulation of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides causing anthracnose rot of mango was carried out.
