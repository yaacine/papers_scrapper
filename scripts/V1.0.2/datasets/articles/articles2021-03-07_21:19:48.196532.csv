1168084,Environmental governance and its implications for conservation practice,2012,Derek Armitage and Rob De Loë and Ryan Plummer,5,,4,245-255,Blackwell Publishing Inc,Governments are no longer the most important source of decision making in the environmental field. Instead. new actors are playing critical decision‐making roles. and new mechanisms and forums for decision making are becoming important (e.g.. in some contexts regulation is being supplemented or replaced by markets and cooperative arrangements). New ways of governing in relation to the environment have important implications for the practice of conservation. Greater awareness of key ideas and concepts of environmental governance can help conservation managers and scientists participate more effectively in governance processes. Understanding how conservation practice is influenced by emergent hybrid and network governance arrangements is particularly important.

1168085,Community capacity for adaptation to climate-induced water shortages: linking institutional complexity and local actors,2004,Janet L Ivey and John Smithers and Rob C De Loë and Reid D Kreutzwiser,33,Environmental management,1,36-47,Springer-Verlag,There is growing concern for the capacity of urban and rural communities to manage current water shortages and to prepare for shortages that may accompany predicted changes in climate. In this paper. concepts relating to the notion of climate adaptation and particularly “capacity building” are used to elucidate several determinants of community-level capacity for water management. These concepts and criteria are then used to interpret empirically derived insights relating to local management of water shortages in Ontario. Canada. General determinants of water-related community capacity relate to upper tier political and institutional arrangements; the characteristics of. and relationships among. pertinent agencies. groups. or individuals involved in water management; and the adequacy of financial. human. information. and technical resources.

1168086,Exploring complex policy questions using the policy Delphi: A multi-round. interactive survey method,1995,Robert C De Loe,15,Applied Geography,1,53-68,Pergamon,The purpose of this paper is to outline the research strategy used to explore a complex policy question relating to climate change and water management. The research strategy used had two components: a multi-round. interactive survey of water users and managers in a watershed. followed by a workshop attended by a small core group. The survey technique used was the policy Delphi. which is distinguished from its cousin. the conventional Delphi. The two techniques share the name ‘Delphi’. but little else. Strengths and weaknesses of the policy Delphi are highlighted in the paper. Strengths include the fact that the survey can be used to facilitate interaction in groups of up to 50 people. Arguments around policy issues can be identified and evaluated by the respondent group. Importantly. this can be achieved at little cost. relative to alternatives such as workshops. An important shortcoming of the policy Delphi is a …,True,fN2vNGcAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC,181,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0143622895910623,866736668999282668,/scholar?cites=866736668999282668,,,0,0,0

It aims to protect surface and groundwater resources by focusing on the integrated and collaborative management of land and water resources and interests on a watershed basis. In this paper. we draw on the policy network perspective on governance to shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of watershed-based processes of collaboration and integration for water quality protection in agricultural areas.

However. similar protection is rarely provided to people reliant on water provided from private wells. In Canada. approximately 4 million people depend on privately owned. domestic wells for their drinking water. Numerous studies have shown that people who rely on private wells for their water supplies are at risk from nitrate and bacterial contamination. Given the fact that regulations relating to private wells tend to be weak or poorly enforced. actions taken by well owners to protect their own drinking water safety are extremely important.

Effective water treatment is a key aspect of drinking water safety. However. just as important is ensuring that sources of drinking water such as rivers and aquifers are protected from contamination. In that context. source water protection is recognized as the first barrier in a multi-barrier approach to drinking water safety. Source water protection occurs at the local scale. and involves numerous local actors with varying capabilities. Consequently. institutional arrangements (IAs) for land use planning and water management are key determinants shaping local capacity for source water protection.

Unfortunately. the large volume change of Si materials during their lithiation/delithiation process results in severe pulverization. loss of electrical contact. unstable solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI). and eventual capacity fading. Although there has been tremendous progress to overcome these issues through nanoscale materials design. improved volumetric capacity and reduced cost are still needed for practical application.

Metallic zinc as a rechargeable anode material for aqueous batteries has gained tremendous attention with merits of intrinsic safety. low cost. and high theoretical volumetric capacity (5.854 mAh cm-3). Among zinc-based batteries. Zn-air batteries are promising with high theoretical gravimetric and volumetric energy densities (1.093 Wh kg-1 and 6.134 Wh L-1. respectively). Rechargeable zinc anode has achieved big progress in neutral electrolytes. yet developed slowly in alkaline electrolytes. which are kinetically favorable for air cathodes. Passivation. dissolution. hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). and dendrite formation are four reasons for irreversibility of zinc anodes in alkaline electrolytes. This thesis comprises three parts: material. mechanism. and device. From the aspect of material. four types of zinc anodes were designed and synthesized to overcome above issues and improve their reversibility. These anodes include graphene oxide-modified (Zn@GO). lasagna-inspired (ZnO@GO). sealed (ZnO@TiNxOy). and hydrogen-evolution-suppressing (ZnO@TiO2) anodes. which improve the deep cycling performance when cycled at lean electrolyte.

However. the toxicity of organic acids presents a key challenge to the development of an economically viable fermentation process. Therefore. a platform organism that not only produces organic acids but also tolerates the associated toxicity is highly desirable. Here we report the discovery. characterization. and engineering of a yeast strain. Issatchenkia orientalis SD108. that is tolerant to low pH and high concentration of organic acids. This strain demonstrated a higher tolerance compared to I. orientalis ATCC 24210 and Classic Distiller’s Turbo yeast. In order to explore SD108 as a potential platform organism for organic acid production. we determined its draft genome sequence and use the sequencing information to guide pathway design. As proof of concept. an engineered four-gene expression cassette related to the reductive TCA cycle was assembled and integrated into the genome of a uracil auxotroph of SD108. The resulting strain was able to produce succinic acid with a titer of 11.63 g/L. yield of 0.12 g/g. and productivity of 0.11 g/L . h in batch cultures using shake flasks.

By now. several sucrose utilization pathways have been identified and characterized. Among them. the pathway consists of sucrose permease and sucrose phosphorylase is an energy-conserving sucrose utilization pathway because it consumes less ATP when comparing to other known pathways. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NK-1 strain can use sucrose as the feedstock to produce poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA). a highly valuable biopolymer. The native sucrose utilization pathway in NK-1 strain consists of phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system and sucrose-6-P hydrolase and consumes more ATP than the energy-conserving sucrose utilization pathway. In this study. the native sucrose utilization pathway in NK-1 was firstly deleted and generated the B. amyloliquefaciens 3Δ strain. Then four combination of heterologous energy-conserving sucrose utilization pathways were constructed and introduced into the 3Δ strain. Results demonstrated that the combination of cscB (encodes sucrose permease) from Escherichia coli and sucP (encodes sucrose phosphorylase) from Bifidobacterium adolescentis showed the highest sucrose metabolic efficiency. The corresponding mutant consumed 49.4% more sucrose and produced 38.5% more γ-PGA than the NK-1 strain under the same fermentation conditions. To our best knowledge. this is the first report concerning the enhancement of the target product production by introducing the heterologous energy-conserving sucrose utilization pathways.

Electrochemical characterizations. including linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis and rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) voltammetry. were carried out to investigate the growth mechanism. The deposition involves the catalytic reduction of dissolved oxygen by the V4+ species of VOx·mH2O. which drives the oxidation of RuCl3 to proceed with the growth of RuO2·nH2O. This core/shell VOx·mH2O/RuO2·nH2O shows a better catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than RuO2·nH2O. which is ascribed to the pronounced dispersion of RuO2·nH2O.

Thus. urea is considered to be potential hydrogen energy source that is inherently safe for fuel cell applications. However. the catalytic reaction suffers from slow kinetics due to six electron transfer in UOR. In this work. β phase NiS is successfully prepared through facile hydrothermal reaction. in which diethanolamine (DEA) was added as chelating agent leading to 3D nanoflower morphology. The crystal structure. surface morphology. and chemical bonding of the β− NiS were characterized by X–ray diffraction (XRD). scanning electron microscope (SEM). and X− ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). respectively. The UOR performance of NiS was evaluated by means of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Tafel analysis. electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). chronoamperometry. and chronopotentiometry in 1 M KOH electrolyte containing 0.33 M urea. Compared to the Ni (OH) 2 counterpart. NiS exhibits lower onset potential. increased current responses. faster kinetics of urea oxidation. lower charge transfer resistance. and higher urea diffusion coefficient. leading to the enhanced catalytic performance toward UOR. Moreover. the developed NiS catalyst exhibits superior stability and tolerance towards urea electro− oxidation in 10.000 s test.

However. the amino acids found in the culture media and the biogenic impurities generated by the enzymes readily poison noble metal catalysts [2]. Substantial purification is currently required before the fermentation products can be further converted using chemical catalysts. Highly active and selective heterogeneous catalyst that can process fermentation broths directly. without extensive separation and purification. are highly desired.Our group explored the electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of biologically-produced muconic acid to 3-hexenedioic acid (3-HDA). a bioadvantaged monomer similar to adipic acid. This approach offers key benefits compared to conventional catalytic hydrogenation [3]. For ECH. the hydrogen needed for the reaction is generated in situ from the aqueous electrolyte through the hydrogen evolution reaction. The reaction is performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. eliminating the need for an external hydrogen source. Most importantly. hydrogen generation and muconic acid hydrogenation are both catalyzed by the same Earthabundant (non-noble) transition metal.,True,7QkrWhwAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2015/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper11453/NAMAbstract_JohnMatthiesen.pdf,5363772424775963151,/scholar?cites=5363772424775963151,,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2015/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper11453/NAMAbstract_JohnMatthiesen.pdf,0,0,0

However. one major challenge of these hybrid technologies is the integration of two distinct processing steps and the attendant complexity that integration entails. For example. fermentation broths contain various biogenic impurities that deactivate precious metal catalysts through reversible and/or irreversible poisoning. One approach. which we have recently reported. entails the use of electrocatalysis to facilitate this integration. The potential of this technology has been demonstrated for the conversion of biologically-produced muconic acid (MA) to monomers for bioadvantaged Nylon-6. 6 production [1].Here. we discuss some of the key considerations for integrating biocatalysis and electrocatalysis for the conversion of biomass to chemicals. the technological relevance of this approach at a systems level. its potential for scale-up. and its economic viability in the context of the industrial production of trans-3-hexenedioic acid (t3HDA). a bioadvantaged monomer similar to adipic acid [2. 3].,True,7QkrWhwAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2017/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper15229/NAM%20Abstract%20Matthiesen.pdf,,,,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2017/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper15229/NAM%20Abstract%20Matthiesen.pdf,0,0,0

This pathway houses a wide diversity of economically important metabolites ranging from polymer precursors to pain-management drugs. whose productions have been highly sought-after in biotechnological research. However. tight regulations at the transcriptional. translational. and allosteric levels surround the aromatic amino acid pathway. protecting the microbial factories (eg S. cerevisiae) from unnecessary energy expenditures. By making use of computational metabolic engineering tools such as Flux Balance Analysis and Metabolic Flux Analysis. together with fast and reliable synthetic biology techniques. the flux into the aromatic amino acid pathway was exploited. Initially. the flux distribution in the central carbon metabolism was studied through 13C-metabolic flux analysis and carbon tracing experiments. Important insights regarding the partition between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway were obtained and correlated with the production of aromatic amino acid derivatives. For the first time. the pentafunctional enzyme. ARO1. composing the core of the shikimic acid pathway was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to reveal its active domains.

Most engineered microbial hosts and a select group of wild-type species can metabolize mixed sugars including oligosaccharides. hexoses. and pentoses that are hydrolyzed from plant biomass.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been overwhelmingly employed for the production of aromatic compounds. especially those plant sourced aromatic natural products with complex structures. albeit at low titers. Although numerous endeavors have been devoted to enhancing the production of aromatic compounds in S. cerevisiae. the final titers remain low and need further improvement for industrial commercialization. The insufficient production is ascribed to two aspects: one is limited precursor availability caused by tight regulations imposed on central metabolism and the other is the stepwise loss resulted from non-balanced and low throughput metabolic pathways.,True,DA0WuIsAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/17449/,,,,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8456&context=etd,0,0,0

Among aqueous battery anode materials. zinc metal stands out because of the highest energies (5846 Ah/L volumetric capacity. 3 times the amount of a lithium metal anode) and an operating potential near the lower limit of water stability window. However. the rechargeability of Zn anodes is hindered by passivation and dissolution problems associated with the solid-solute-solid transformation during cycling. Here we solve both problems simultaneously by designing a distinctive nanostructured zinc anode in which 100 nm ZnO nanoparticles are wrapped and segmented by graphene oxide (GO) sheets.

In this work. we present a novel strategy to improve this solid–solid interface problem and maintain good interfacial contact during battery cycling by introducing an adaptive buffer layer (ABL) between the Li metal anode and SPE. The ABL consists of low molecular-weight polypropylene carbonate . poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). and lithium salt. Rheological experiments indicate that ABL is viscoelastic and that it flows with a higher viscosity compared to PEO-only SPE. ABL also has higher ionic conductivity than PEO-only SPE.

Phenol’s properties have been studied for centuries. particularly its partial miscibility with water. Generally. partially miscible liquids become more soluble with the increase in temperature and at a certain temperature they are completely miscible. This temperature is known as the critical solution temperature (CST) or consolute temperature. The temperature above which the phases of a system are completely miscible is known as the upper consulate temperature (UCT) and it gets affected by the addition of impurities. To find the miscibility temperature. the mixture was heated in a boiling tube until the turbidity disappeared and the final temperature was noted. Then. the mixture was cooled down and the temperature noted when the turbidity reappeared. Solutions of impurities of different concentrations were formed and their effect on the UCT of the ternary system created by the impurities. Phenol. and water was analyzed.It was found that the ionic compounds. which get hydrated with water. show lesser increase in CST as they decrease the miscibility to a lesser extent. Further. at all concentrations. CST of phenol-water system containing Camphor as impurity is maximum and it increases with increasing concentration. Thus. Camphor is the most suitable substance to be added to increase the UCT of phenol-water system.,True,cp4DRs0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1,https://www.ijires.org/administrator/components/com_jresearch/files/publications/IJIRES_987_FINAL.pdf,14212975327508371712,/scholar?cites=14212975327508371712,,https://www.ijires.org/administrator/components/com_jresearch/files/publications/IJIRES_987_FINAL.pdf,0,0,0

The method is based on the difference in the interface energies of organic and aqueous solutions with the CNT surface. Because of their lipophilic character. the organic solvent better wets the surface of the nanotubes compared to water and penetrates into the inner volume. The precise control of the volume of each phase allows filling the CNT with the organic phase and covering its outer surface with the aqueous one. Hence. metal nanoparticles can be put with high selectivity either inside or outside the CNT. just by choosing in which solvent the metal precursor is dissolved. SEM.

Fe/CNT shows a better behavior than Pt/CNT. although a faster deactivation. The main reason of deactivation is cross-over of the electrolyte. particularly of K ions. They react with iron particles and cause their dissolution and migration. In the case of Pt/CNT there is no. or minor. dissolution of metal. but potassium covers the Pt particles and/or induce deactivation. It is shown. however. that the electrolyte was necessary to simulate the half-cell of the full photoelectrocatalytic device. while in the latter no electrolyte is needed. being the protons and electrons produced by water splitting.

Biomass-derived glucose can be isomerized to fructose using either Lewis acid or Brønsted base catalysts. Lewis acids are typically preferred as alkaline conditions promote a large number of side reactions. It is widely admitted that only low fructose yields. below 10%. are achievable with inorganic bases. Here. fructose was synthesized with 32% yield using commercially available organic amines. Glucose conversion and fructose selectivity were comparable to Lewis acids. which opens new perspectives for the base-catalyzed pathway.,True,FW1A3IsAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,115,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cs501197w,14041088733551018727,/scholar?cites=14041088733551018727,,http://pstorage-acs-6854636.s3.amazonaws.com/3863851/cs501197w_si_001.pdf,0,0,0

However. the analysis of XPS data—in particular the C 1s region—can be complex. impeding a straightforward evaluation of the data. In this work. an overview of extrinsic and intrinsic effects that influence the C 1s XPS spectra—for example. photon broadening or carbon–catalyst interaction—of various graphitic samples is presented. Controlled manipulation of such samples is performed by annealing. sputtering. and oxygen functionalization to identify different C [BOND] C bonding states and assess the impact of the manipulations on spectral line shapes and their binding energy positions. With high-resolution XPS and XPS depth profiling. the spectral components arising from disordered carbon and surface-defect states can be distinguished from aromatic sp2 carbon. These findings illustrate that both spectral line shapes and binding energy components must be considered in the analysis of potentially defective surfaces of carbon materials. The sp2 peak. characteristic of aromatic carbon. features a strong asymmetry that changes with the curvature of the sample surface and. thus. cannot be neglected in spectral analysis.

The synthesis and characterization of hybrid ZIFs with mixed linkers in the framework are described in this work. producing materials with properties distinctly different from the parent frameworks (ZIF-8.

A new electrolyte used in this study. urea/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium fluoride. can surprisingly dissolve zinc oxides. ZnO was chosen as a zinc source instead of ZnCl2 used in the conventional method. A Cu cathode was employed as the copper source in situ operation instead of the conventional method that copper source is introduced by adding copper salts. The electrochemical behavior of zinc in the system was investigated using linear sweep voltammograms and cyclic voltammetric techniques. The results illustrated that the zinc reduction is a diffusion-controlled irreversible process via a single-step two-electron transfer procedure. The diffusion coefficient was 1.8× 10− 8 cm 2 s− 1. Electrode reaction becomes more reversible and equal potentials shift toward the positive direction as temperature increases from 333 to 373 K. Electrodeposition experiments are performed on a Cu cathode and electrodeposits are identified as Cu5Zn8 alloy via XRD and EDS. The cross-sectional SEM showed that a distinguishable layer of Cu5Zn8 alloy was discovered on the surface of the Cu cathode and the thickness of this Cu5Zn8 layer was approximately 2 μm. An EDS linear scanning analysis for this layer showed that a high concentration of zinc atoms was distributed on the surface and the copper atoms were …,True,xDHhlRgAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC,1,http://electrochemsci.org/papers/vol12/120201521.pdf,11702194294255021175,/scholar?cites=11702194294255021175,,http://electrochemsci.org/papers/vol12/120201521.pdf,0,0,0

However. most studied oxygen vacancies are unstable and susceptible under the oxygen circumstance. Here. we fabricated cobalt-defected Co3–xO4 in situ for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). XAFS and PALS characterizations show that the crystals have abundant Co vacancies and a distorted structure. DFT calculations indicate that the metal defects lead to obvious electronic delocalization. which enhances the carrier transport to participate in water-splitting reactions along the defective conducting channels and the water adsorption/activation on the catalyst surface.

A singular value decomposition analysis is utilized to the covariance matrix of NDVI and temperature. Most of the squared covariance is captured by the first several paired-modes. The first seven modes account for 91.6%. This implies that the temperature is a very important factor influencing vegetation activity. The NDVI changes in response to temperature fluctuations on the interannual time scale show well-defined large-scale and consistent patterns. The first paired-modes. which explains 42.64% of the squared-covariance. indicate the strongest coupling between vegetation and temperature appears in western Siberia. The large-scale atmospheric system. Eurasian pattern (EU). plays a dominant role for that.

The hydrocarbons undergo quick configurational isomerization and then skeletal rearrangement toward alkyl-adamantanes. Although having different molecular structure. these hydrocarbons all lead to adamantanes substituted with 2–3 methyl and/or ethyl groups. The alkyl-adamantanes show high density. low freezing point and viscosity. and are very attractive as high-density fuels. Computation using density functional theory confirms that alkyl-adamantanes are thermodynamically favored and explains the experimental product distribution very well.

For the reaction without radical initiators. ion-pair mechanism well rationalizes the unique stereospecificity. It involves three consecutive steps: formation of ion-pair species (Ad= Ad-Cl+/Cl-and Ad= Ad-Cl+/NS-). stereospecific proton abstraction from 4-axial (4-a) position and kinetically preferred intramolecular 4-equatorial (4-e) cyclopropylcarbinyl-homoallylic rearrangement. As to the reaction with the presence of radical initiators. the free radical mechanism fails to explain the experimental results. but the radical cation mechanism works well. In this channel. Ad= Ad+· is formed via one-electron oxidization with the assistance of oxidants like Cl·. NS· and Ad= Ad-Cl+. Then the stereospecific 4-e-Ad= Ad+ formed by hydrogen loss from 4-e position of Ad= Ad+· interacts with chloride anion and gives the final product.,True,A1kxEKMAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://cpfd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CPFDTOTAL-ZGHY201406001772.htm,,,,,0,0,0

V2O5 is obtained from a sodium metavanadate solution in water under ambient conditions. resulting in a final thin film of formula V2O5·0.5H2O. The 0.5 water molecules are not removed from the V2O5 layered structure unless the sample is heated above 250 °C. which makes the thin film highly stable under real working conditions. The HTL was used in OSCs in the normal and the inverted configurations. applying metallic Ag as the back-metal electrode in both cases.

Based upon Boltzmann superposition principle the constitutive law with a power-law kernel is ruled by the Caputo’s fractional derivative. Fractional constitutive law posses a long memory and then the parameters obtained by best fitting procedures on experimental data are strongly influenced by the prestress on the specimen. As in fact during the relaxation test the imposed history of deformation is not instantaneously applied. since a unit step function may not be realized by the test machine.Usually an initial ramp is present in the deformation history and the time at which the deformation attains the maximum value is fixed by the operator.

In particular. two PLA/artichoke composites with the same fiber loading (10% w/w) were prepared by the film-stacking method: the first one (UNID) reinforced with unidirectional long artichoke fibers. the second one (RANDOM) reinforced by randomly-oriented long artichoke fibers. Both composites were mechanically characterized in tensile mode by quasi-static and dynamic mechanical tests. The morphology of the fracture surfaces was analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover. a theoretical model. ie. Hill’s method. was used to fit the experimental Young’s modulus of the biocomposites. The quasi-static tensile tests revealed that the modulus of UNID composites is significantly higher than that of the neat PLA (ie.~ 40%). Moreover. the tensile strength is slightly higher than that of the neat matrix. The other way around. the stiffness of RANDOM composites is not significantly improved. and the tensile strength decreases in comparison to the neat PLA.

The environmental degradation of the mechanical properties of hemp and hemp/basalt hybrid-reinforced high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composites has been investigated with a special focus on the effects of water ageing and accelerated ageing. including hygrothermal and UV radiation. Modification of the matrix was carried out using a maleic anhydride high-density polyethylene copolymer (MAPE) as a compatibilizer. Hybridization of hemp fibres with basalt fibres and the incorporation of MAPE were found to significantly decrease the water uptake (up to 75%) and increase the retention of mechanical properties after accelerated ageing. Secondary crystallization phenomena occurring in the composites. as confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. were able to counteract the severe combined effects of hygrothermal stress and UV radiation. with the exception of hemp-fibre composites where permanent damage to the fibres occurred. with 2% and 20% reduction in tensile strength and modulus. respectively. for a 30 wt% hemp fibre-reinforced HDPE.

The mass balance calculations performed for the tested cases of 400. 500 and 600 C. showed a high gas yield (44%) at the temperature of 600 C. which can be used to fulfil the process energy needs. At the low temperature of 400 C the oil production reach its maximum yield. while the bromine content of the oil has also a maximum percentage of 0.5% wt. Several valuable compounds have been detected in the oil composition. which can be used either as fuels or for feedstock recycling.,True,v1UZiCMAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1261087,,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1261087,0,0,0
1168673,Two-step pyrolysis of biomass to enhance the chemical stability of pyrolytic liquids,2017,Henry Persson and Panagiotis Evangelopoulos and Rikard Svanberg and Yang Weihong,7,,25thEUBCE,1186-1189,ETA-Florence Renewable Energies,Aging of pyrolytic liquid during storage changes its chemical and physical properties. The reason for aging is the chemical instability of the liquid. which is not at thermodynamic equilibrium when quenched after pyrolysis. Compounds active in these reactions mainly derivatives from hemicellulose (eg acids and carbonyls). In this work. a two-step pyrolysis concept was investigated to separate these compounds in a lower temperature treatment step upstream a conventional pyrolyzer. Different temperatures of the lower temperature treatment was investigated with constant conditions of the conventional treatment. The total liquid yield derived did not vary from pyrolysis in one step. Results show that the two-step pyrolysis process significantly reduces the concentration of organic acids and carbonyls in the liquid product from the second pyrolyzer. which instead are found in the liquid from the lower temperature treatment. Also. the concentration of sugar derivatives from the second step treatment is increased with the temperature of the first step. However. a complete separation of aging active compounds is not possible without sacrificing partial fractions of others (lignin derivatives were found in the low-temperature treatment). By varying the temperature of the first step one can control the concentrations and the liquid yield from each step.,True,v1UZiCMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1193483,,,,,0,0,0

1168675,Low temperature pyrolysis of the Automotive Shredder Residues (ASR) for energy recovery and metal recycling,,Panagiotis Evangelopoulos and Nanta Sophonrat and Henrik Jilvero and Weihong Yang,,,,,,Automotive Shredder Residues (ASR) is the remaining fraction from metal recovery of end-oflife vehicle (ELV). While the processes for recovery metal from ELV are well developed. the process for recovery metal from ASR remains a challenging problem. In this work. low temperature pyrolysis of ASR is investigated with the speculation that low temperature and inert environment would benefit the metal property ie metal will not be oxidized and enhance the separation of the organic part from the metals. The pyrolysis experiments were done in a tube reactor at 300-500 C. The gas and oil were analyzed by micro GC and GC/MS accordingly. It is found that the gas contains high amount of CO2 and the energy recovery is limited. The oil contains high phenolic and aromatic compounds. The solid residue was crushed and fractionated by different particle sizes. It was found that temperature of 400 C seem to be suitable for liberating metal fractions with a particle size greater than 0.5 mm.,True,v1UZiCMAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2466328382122144475&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Fibers of different length were randomly distributed and thermal conductivity measurements of the obtained composite were carried out by hot-wire method.

The interesting sorption properties of this material yield a high COP=0.6 that gives a promising alternative to the common zeolite or silica gel for application in solid sorption units driven by low temperature heat (T ⩽100 °C).

Aim of the present work is the assessment of possible benefits arising from the use of thermally driven systems. with focus on two technologies: absorption and adsorption. A dynamic simulation of the whole waste heat recovery system and the sorption refrigerators has been performed. For the modelling of the thermally driven chillers. experimental data from two prototypes have been employed. The results show that. for a cooling load typical of the Italian fishing fleet. fuel savings up to 1600 kg/y can be achieved. corresponding to 3 ton/y of avoided CO2 emissions.

If particulates are causally involved with respiratory symptoms. it is important to understand which components may be responsible. However. increasing evidence suggests that transition metals present in particles. especially iron. generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may be involved in producing some of the observed respiratory symptoms. The hypothesis for this study is twofold: bioavailable transition metals from inhaled airborne particulates catalyze redox reactions in human lung epithelial cells. leading to oxidative stress and increased production of mediators of pulmonary inflammation: and the size. transition metal content. and mineral speciation of particulates affect their ability to cause these effects. This work focused on the relation between physical characteristics of particles (eg. size. bioavailable transition metal content. and mineral speciation) and their ability to generate hydroxyl radicals in cell-free systems and to cause oxidative stress. which results in the synthesis of mediators of pulmonary inflammation in cultured human lung epithelial cells.

This book covers a gap on the market by providing a concise introduction to combustion. Most of the other books currently available are targeted towards the experienced users and contain too many details and/or contain knowledge at a fairly high level. This book provides a brief and clear overview of the combustion basics. suitable for beginners and then focuses on practical aspects. rather than theory. illustrated by a number of industrial applications as examples. The content is aimed to provide a general understanding of the various concepts. techniques and equipment for students at all level as well as practitioners with little or no prior experience in the field. The authors are all international experts in the field of combustion technology and adopt here a clear didactic style with many practical examples to cover the most common solid. liquid and gaseous fuels.

Square. triangle. sine and sawtooth current waveforms with various frequency and amplitude settings were applied to a lab scale electrolyser with current densities up to 5000 A/m2. A novel. fully automatic measurement and data acquisition system was designed in order to generate thousands of experiments in a short period of time. The results show that non-steady DC current applied to the cell cause efficiency loss compared to the steady DC condition at same current density.

1168752,A robust method for the quantitative shadow imaging of dense reacting particulate flows,2013,Pal Toth and Arpad B Palotas and Terry A Ring and Eric G Eddings,,"The 8th US National Combustion Meeting, Park City, Utah",,,,Quantitative shadow imaging or particle shadow velocimetry is a relatively recent method for the quantification and analysis of heterogeneous flows. Shadow imaging can yield information about the geometric characteristics of sprays. jets and particulate flows. When applied to the analysis of solid-gas or solid-liquid flows. shadow velocimetry allows for the extraction of individual particle velocities. sizes and shape parameters. An advantage of shadow imaging over other diagnostic techniques is that it retains the spatial information of individual particles and the positions of particles relative to each other can be analyzed. Another advantage is that shadowgraphy is a direct technique that allows for the visualization of microscales in heterogeneous flows. Digital image processing and analysis makes shadow imaging quantitative. By image processing techniques. individual particles are detected in the shadow images which are further analyzed to obtain their geometric and hydrodynamic properties. The fidelity of data extracted by quantitative shadow imaging depends on the quality of images and the robustness and capabilities of the image processing algorithm used. In this study we focus on the processing of very degraded shadow images of dense reacting particulate flows. An algorithm that is robust enough to reliably quantify such images does not exist yet.

This paper summarizes initial oxygen-blown gasification experiments with two bark residues from a European pulp and paper mill. ie. a softwood bark and a hardwood bark. The gasification process was characterized by measuring syngas yields and process efficiency to find optimum operating conditions. In addition. impurities in the syngas and ash behavior were characterized. Maximum yields of CO and H 2 were obtained from softwood bark and amounted to approximately 29 and 15 mol/kg fuel. respectively. Optimum cold gas efficiency was achieved at an oxygen stoichiometric ratio of λ= 0.40 and was approximately 76% and 70% for softwood bark and hardwood bark. respectively. Increased λ had a reducing effect on pollutants in the syngas. eg. higher hydrocarbons. NH 3. HCl. and soot. The situation for sulfur species was more complex. Evaluation of the bark ashes indicated that slag formation could start already from 800 C. Furthermore. a non-intrusive laser diagnostics technique gave rapid feedback on the millisecond scale.

A two-stage burner was used. Soot was generated for ethylene. JP-8 surrogate n-dodecanem-xylene. m-xylene. and n-dodecane air premixed flames. Downstream. the soot-laden gases were passed through a secondary flat-flame burner where soot was burned out under fuel-lean or-rich conditions. The process was followed by the evolution of particle size distribution. flame temperature. gas-phase composition. soot morphology and nanostructure. Measurements of soot size distribution and number concentration as a function of the HAB showed particle fragmentation. evidenced by the decrease in particle mean diameter and a significant increase in number concentration in the region where O2 concentration decreased. Higher in the burner. soot was burned as a result of the increase in OH concentration which produced higher soot oxidation rates.

Therefore. source apportionment remains the final challenge for all PM characterization studies in complex airsheds such as the PdN. Of particular interest to the PdN airbasin would be the ability to perform PM exposure risk modeling based on reliable source apportionment. Moreover. it is becoming abundantly clear that not all PM components are equally hazardous to human health (Pope 2002).

The analyzed soot was generated in premixed flames of liquid fuels: n-dodecane. m-xylene and n-butanol and oxidized under elevated pressures. Nanostructure is described via differentiating between the isotropic and nematic phases of soot particles. These phases are characterized by the polar and nematic order parameters. Along with the order parameters. the nematic phase is further characterized by graphene layer spacing and length. The structural parameters were measured by utilizing high-resolution electron microscopy and digital image analysis. The image analysis framework used in this paper is a recent development. that provided us with high-fidelity structural data. This refined methodology made drawing our conclusions possible.

The strength of PCAPs can be measured using heat deficit. which can also serve as an indication of whether a PCAP is building. being maintained. or being destroyed [1]. Meteorological factors limiting dispersion of the pollutants in the Salt Lake Valley include temperature. atmospheric stability (Heat Deficit). relative humidity and snow cover. These factors are closely related to the atmospheric chemistry of the secondary particulate formation [4]. For example. the reflection from the snow cover produces higher levels of solar radiation for photochemical reactions and the high humidity and low temperatures are important in the formation and conservation of secondary particulates [5].The contribution of residential wood combustion to PM2. 5 has been the focus of several recent studies in Utah valleys. Previous studies. based on PMF analysis of 24-h filter samples collected at Utah Division of Air Quality (UDAQ) sampling sites. reported that on a typical winter day. wood burning contributes approximately to 16% of the particulate pollution levels (PM2. 5) in the Salt Lake Valley and 21% in Utah County [2-3].,True,FBfaPfwAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,0,https://documents.deq.utah.gov/air-quality/planning/technical-analysis/DAQ-2020-012302.pdf,,,,https://documents.deq.utah.gov/air-quality/planning/technical-analysis/DAQ-2020-012302.pdf,0,0,0

1168838,A multi-scale approach to nonuniform diffusion,1993,Ross T Whitaker and Stephen M Pizer,57,CVGIP: Image Understanding,1,99-110,Academic Press,"This paper examines a new method of image processing that combines information at multiple scales in order to locate boundaries. The method employs a technique of edge-affected diffusion. where blurring is limited by the presence of edges as measured at the scale of interest. By repeating such processing and measuring gradients at successively smaller scales one is able to trace a ""path"" through scale space which can preserve accurate information about boundaries of objects. and yet selectively remove objects that fall below a scale of interest. We compared this approach with the anisotropic diffusion technique described by Perona and Malik. which depends only on the local gradient of intensity of the processed image.

1168839,Geometric surface smoothing via anisotropic diffusion of normals,2002,Tolga Tasdizen and Ross Whitaker and Paul Burchard and Stanley Osher,,,,125-132,IEEE,This paper introduces a method for smoothing complex. noisy surfaces. while preserving (and enhancing) sharp. geometric features. It has two main advantages over previous approaches to feature preserving surface smoothing. First is the use of level set surface models. which allows us to process very complex shapes of arbitrary and changing topology. This generality makes it well suited for processing surfaces that are derived directly from measured data. The second advantage is that the proposed method derives from a well-founded formulation. which is a natural generalization of anisotropic diffusion. as used in image processing. This formulation is based on the proposition that the generalization of image filtering entails filtering the normals of the surface. rather than processing the positions of points on a mesh.,True,FaOZ6EMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,317,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1183766/,15825971987537931874,/scholar?cites=15825971987537931874,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tolga_Tasdizen/publication/2866430_Geometric_Surface_Smoothing_via_Anisotropic_Diffusion_of_Normals/links/02bfe512644af88dc8000000.pdf,0,0,0

First. 3D level sets are relatively slow to compute. Second. their formulation usually entails several free parameters which can be very difficult to correctly tune for specific applications. This paper presents a tool for 3D segmentation that relies on level-set surface models computed at interactive rates on commodity graphics cards (GPUs). The interactive rates for solving the level-set PDE give the user immediate feedback on the parameter settings. and thus users can tune three separate parameters and control the shape of the model in real time.

Heidelberg,Rician noise introduces a bias into MRI measurements that can have a significant impact on the shapes and orientations of tensors in diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images. This is less of a problem in structural MRI. because this bias is signal dependent and it does not seriously impair tissue identification or clinical diagnoses. However. diffusion imaging is used extensively for quantitative evaluations. and the tensors used in those evaluations are biased in ways that depend on orientation and signal levels. This paper presents a strategy for filtering diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images that addresses these issues. The method is a maximum a posteriori estimation technique that operates directly on the diffusion weighted images and accounts for the biases introduced by Rician noise.

The coupling is realized using Fluent 15.07 software. and the numerical model is validated for stirred tank reactor. The population balance equation (PBE) is solved using quadrature method of moments (QMOM) technique along with a correction procedure implemented to check and correct invalid moment sets. The breakage and coalescence of bubbles due to turbulence are considered. Breakage rate and daughter size distribution models proposed by Laakkonen. as well as coalescence rate model of Coulaloglou and Tavlarides are implemented. Interaction between the phases is handled by considering the custom drag force model while ignoring other interphase forces. The correction algorithm has been successfully implemented and improved predictions of air volume fraction and Sauter mean diameter have been observed with very good match between predictions and measurements. The correction model will be used to study complex multiphase flows in flotation cells with kinetic models capable of predicting flotation rate constant using local bubble size information.,True,yz11F-8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,6,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Manjunath_Basavarajappa/publication/280610929_Gas_Dispersion_Characteristics_in_Lab-Scale_Flotation_Cell_using_Coupled_CFD-PBM_Quadrature_Based_Moment_Method/links/55be441f08aed621de120f7a/Gas-Dispersion-Characteristics-in-Lab-Scale-Flotation-Cell-using-Coupled-CFD-PBM-Quadrature-Based-Moment-Method.pdf,10483719211008851301,/scholar?cites=10483719211008851301,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Manjunath_Basavarajappa/publication/280610929_Gas_Dispersion_Characteristics_in_Lab-Scale_Flotation_Cell_using_Coupled_CFD-PBM_Quadrature_Based_Moment_Method/links/55be441f08aed621de120f7a/Gas-Dispersion-Characteristics-in-Lab-Scale-Flotation-Cell-using-Coupled-CFD-PBM-Quadrature-Based-Moment-Method.pdf,0,0,0
1168861,The effect of particle size on coal flotation kinetics: A review,2018,JM Sokolović and Sanja Miskovic,54,,,,,Coal flotation is a complex multiphase process governed by different sub-processes and interphase interactions. The coal cleaning efficiency by flotation is largely affected by many different physical and chemical factors that can be roughly classified into three main group: coal feed properties. pulp chemical and rheological properties. and machine and operational properties. A great number of flotation kinetic model have been proposed in literature but a vast majority uses three parameters to describe the flotation kinetics. which are the ultimate recovery. the flotation rate constant. and flotation time. The models expand on the classical theory of flotation proposed by Zuniga (1935) that is based on the assumption that the particle–bubble collision rate is first-order with respect to the number of particles in the system. while bubble concentration remains constant. The flotation rate constant is directly proportional to available bubble surface area and probability of flotation. which is strongly dependent on particle size. Therefore. particle size is one of the most important parameters in coal flotation because it affects gas bubble mineralization and froth stability. bubble size distribution and air holdup. bubble-particle collision. attachment. and detachment rates. and reagent adsorption. Numerous researchers have studied the effect of particle size on flotation kinetics over years. This paper provides a comprehensive review of coal flotation kinetics models with a special focus on the effect of particle size on coal kinetic rate. recovery. and product quality. A particular emphasis will be put on research findings reported over the last three decades.,True,yz11F-8AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,4,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-77b92c6b-859a-4ce2-a350-11746f413d41,10315557882590875507,/scholar?cites=10315557882590875507,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-77b92c6b-859a-4ce2-a350-11746f413d41/c/1172-1190_PPMP_2018_4.pdf,0,0,0

Four impeller blade shapes covering a wide range of surface areas and lip lengths are considered to highlight and contrast the flow behavior predicted in the impeller stream. The mean flow close to the impeller is fully characterized by considering velocity components along the axial direction at different radial locations. Normalized results suggest the development of a comparatively stronger axial velocity component for a blade design with the smallest lip length. called big-tip impeller here.

Impact mechanics is typically modelled using a wide range of numerical approaches. such as rigid body dynamics and wave propagation. However. many of these methods are limited to capturing the impact of bodies but not the fracture mechanics. especially at weak spot regions like material interfaces. cracks. or voids. Imperfections decrease the strength of materials due to the presence of stress concentration regions leading to failure occurring at the lower stress levels. Therefore. due to the limitations in the classical theories. alternative methods need to be considered.

1168878,Ambient and laboratory evaluation of a low-cost particulate matter sensor,2017,KE Kelly and J Whitaker and A Petty and C Widmer and A Dybwad and D Sleeth and R Martin and A Butterfield,221,Environmental pollution,,491-500,Elsevier,Low-cost. light-scattering-based particulate matter (PM) sensors are becoming more widely available and are being increasingly deployed in ambient and indoor environments because of their low cost and ability to provide high spatial and temporal resolution PM information. Researchers have begun to evaluate some of these sensors under laboratory and environmental conditions. In this study. a low-cost. particulate matter sensor (Plantower PMS 1003/3003) used by a community air-quality network is evaluated in a controlled wind-tunnel environment and in the ambient environment during several winter-time. cold-pool events that are associated with high ambient levels of PM. In the wind-tunnel. the PMS sensor performance is compared to two research-grade. light-scattering instruments. and in the ambient tests. the sensor performance is compared to two federal equivalent (one tapered element oscillating …,True,cILti4sAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC,175,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974911632718X,11188878719075932305,/scholar?cites=11188878719075932305,,http://www.pmca.tw/files/dwn1550049814.pdf,0,0,0

PM2.5 concentrations in residential and nonresidential areas of Salt Lake City. Utah. were elevated during days with persistent multi-day stable layers or cold-air pools (CAPs). Under most conditions the PM2.5 concentrations and atmospheric stability increased with time during these events. so that the highest PM2.5 concentrations were observed in long-lived CAPs. PM2.5 concentrations were generally observed to decrease with increasing elevation and were linearly related to the pre-sunrise valley heat deficit. an instantaneous measure of atmospheric stability. Decreases of up to 30 percent were observed as elevation increased from 1300 to 1600 m. During the CAP episode of 23–30 January. concentrations of PM2.5 increased roughly linearly with time at all elevations at the rate of about 6 μg (m3 day)−1. Higher elevation sites also experienced more rapid influxes of clean air …,True,cILti4sAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,127,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231011011204,1024440676732838423,/scholar?cites=1024440676732838423,,http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~whiteman/homepage/articles/Silcox2011Atmospheric%20Environment.pdf,0,0,0
