1030810,The Dnmt3a PWWP domain reads histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation and guides DNA methylation,2010,Arunkumar Dhayalan and Arumugam Rajavelu and Philipp Rathert and Raluca Tamas and Renata Z Jurkowska and Sergey Ragozin and Albert Jeltsch,285,Journal of Biological Chemistry,34,26114-26120,Elsevier,The Dnmt3a DNA methyltransferase contains in its N-terminal part a PWWP domain that is involved in chromatin targeting. Here. we have investigated the interaction of the PWWP domain with modified histone tails using peptide arrays and show that it specifically recognizes the histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation mark. H3K36me3 is known to be a repressive modification correlated with DNA methylation in mammals and heterochromatin in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These results were confirmed by equilibrium peptide binding studies and pulldown experiments with native histones and purified native nucleosomes. The PWWP-H3K36me3 interaction is important for the subnuclear localization of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-fused Dnmt3a.

A detailed knowledge of the target modifications of reading domains. including enhancing and inhibiting secondary modifications. will lead to a better understanding of the biological signaling processes mediated by reading domains. We describe the application of Celluspots peptide arrays which contain 384 histone peptides carrying 59 post translational modifications in different combinations as an inexpensive. reliable and fast method for initial screening for specific interactions of reading domains with modified histone peptides. To validate the method. we tested the binding specificities of seven known epigenetic reading domains on Celluspots peptide arrays. viz. the HP1ß and MPP8 Chromo domains. JMJD2A and 53BP1 Tudor domains. Dnmt3a PWWP domain. Rag2 PHD domain and BRD2 Bromo domain. In general. the binding results agreed with literature data with respect to the primary specificity of the reading domains. but in almost all cases we obtained additional new information concerning the influence of secondary modifications surrounding the target modification.

Triacylglycerols (TAGs) were found to oxidise much faster in the presence of β-carotene and slower in the presence of astaxanthin. while β-carotene degradation was much faster than that of astaxanthin. Astaxanthin was found to protect the TAGs of olive oils for up to 10 h of thermal treatment. Both carotenoids were found to significantly increase peroxide values at higher exposure time. A total of 11 TAGs oxidised species were identified. including a new class of oxidised species (hydroxy epidioxides). reported here for the first time. The effect of carotenoids on the formation of oxidised TAGs illustrates that the pro-oxidant action of β-carotene was much stronger than that of astaxanthin.

1030830,Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of carotenoids in plant and animal samples,2010,Alam Zeb and Michael Murkovic,23,,,94-103,Springer International Publishing,Carotenoids are among the most widespread and important pigments in living organisms. They are found in common foods and vegetables. The characteristic pattern of alternating single and double bonds in the polyene backbone enables them to absorb excess energy from other molecules. The nature of the specific end groups on carotenoids may effect their polarity. thus solubility ranges from acetone to hexane. Because of this wide range of polarity. specific extraction and separation procedures are required. In these procedures use of planar chromatography in food analysis might seem a minor aspect of carotenoid analysis.

Recent evidence shows that Arf1/COPI can bud nano-LDs (∼60 nm diameter) from phospholipid-covered oil/water interfaces in vitro. We show that Arf1/COPI proteins localize to cellular LDs. are sufficient to bud nano-LDs from cellular LDs. and are required for targeting specific TG-synthesis enzymes to LD surfaces. Cells lacking Arf1/COPI function have increased amounts of phospholipids on LDs. resulting in decreased LD surface tension and impairment to form bridges to the ER.

In vitro import assays performed on tryptically digested yeast mitochondria showed reduced Bim insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) indicating that protein receptors may be involved in the import process. However. RNAi against components of TOM (Tom40. Tom70.

In isolated yeast mitochondria. lack of Tom70 or the TOM-components Tom20 or Tom22 alone did not affect the import of Bim into the outer mitochondrial membrane. In yeast. expression of Bim can sensitize the cells to Bax-dependent killing. This sensitization was unaffected by the absence of Tom70 or by an experimental reduction in Tom40.

To verify VEGF-C mRNA expression. reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out. The expression of VEGF-C correlated with lymphatic involvement. lymph nodes metastasis. and depth of invasion. On the other hand. correlations were nil with regard to gender of the patients. histologic type. venous involvement. and liver metastasis. The expression of VEGF-C in metastatic lymph nodes was fairly consistent with this expression in the primary tumour. Survival time was shorter for VEGF-C positive groups …,True,JcGtlSQAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,425,https://www.nature.com/articles/6691396,15986455554350882226,/scholar?cites=15986455554350882226,,https://www.nature.com/articles/6691396.pdf?origin=ppub,0,0,0
1030846,Cellular mechanisms regulating protein synthesis and skeletal muscle hypertrophy in animals,2009,Mitsunori Miyazaki and Karyn A Esser,106,,4,1367-1373,American Physiological Society,Growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle mass is critical for long-term health and quality of life. Skeletal muscle is a highly adaptable tissue with well-known sensitivities to environmental cues such as growth factors. cytokines. nutrients. and mechanical loading. All of these factors act at the level of the cell and signal through pathways that lead to changes in phenotype through multiple mechanisms. In this review. we discuss the animal and cell culture models used and the signaling mechanisms identified in understanding regulation of protein synthesis in response to mechanical loading/resistance exercise. Particular emphasis has been placed on 1) alterations in mechanical loading and regulation of protein synthesis in both in vivo animal studies and in vitro cell culture studies and 2) upstream mediators regulating mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and protein synthesis during skeletal muscle hypertrophy.,True,JcGtlSQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,207,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.91355.2008,8388799654754894009,/scholar?cites=8388799654754894009,,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.91355.2008,0,0,0

The protein kinase mTORC1 has been shown to be a key signalling hub through which different anabolic factors (i.e. growth factors. nutrients and mechanical strain) contribute to the regulation of protein synthesis. In this study. we use an in vivo model of muscle hypertrophy to delineate the contribution of different input pathways regulating mTORC1. We found that the insulin/insulin like growth factor 1 pathway is not necessary for early activation of mTORC1 signalling but this probably occurs through activation of the ERK/TSC2 pathway. Knowledge of the key upstream pathways that modulate mTORC1 activity in vivo will provide the necessary foundation for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass.,True,JcGtlSQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,175,https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.2011.205658,5078511729376469523,/scholar?cites=5078511729376469523,,https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1113/jphysiol.2011.205658,0,0,0

In this study. we determined that the stress responsive gene REDD2 (regulated in development and DNA damage responses 2) is a negative regulator of mTOR signaling and is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle. Overexpression of REDD2 in muscle cells significantly inhibited basal mTOR signaling and diminished the response of mTOR to leucine addition or mechanical stretch. The inhibitory function of REDD2 on mTOR signaling seems to be mediated downstream or independent of Akt signaling and upstream of Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain). Knock down of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) using small interfering (si)RNA potently activated mTOR signaling and was sufficient to rescue REDD2 inhibition of mTOR activity. suggesting that REDD2 functions by modulating …,True,JcGtlSQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,66,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpcell.00464.2008,7610310190694381954,/scholar?cites=7610310190694381954,,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpcell.00464.2008,0,0,0

Woon et al. (2007) linked the circadian clock gene Bmal1 to hypertension and metabolic dysfunction in the SHR. Building on these findings. we compared the expression pattern of several core-clock genes in the gastrocnemius muscle of aged SHR (80 weeks; overt heart failure) compared to aged-matched control WKY strain. Heart failure was associated with marked effects on the expression of Bmal1. Clock and Rora in addition to several non-circadian genes important in regulating skeletal muscle phenotype including Mck. Ttn and Mef2c. We next performed circadian time-course collections at a young age (8 weeks; pre-hypertensive) and adult age (22 weeks; hypertensive) to determine if clock gene expression was disrupted in gastrocnemius. heart and liver tissues prior to or after the rats became hypertensive. We found that hypertensive/hypertrophic SHR showed a dampening of peak Bmal1 and Rev-erb expression in the liver. and the clock-controlled gene Pgc1α in the gastrocnemius. In addition. the core-clock gene Clock and the muscle-specific. clock-controlled gene Myod1. no longer maintained a circadian pattern of expression in gastrocnemius from the hypertensive SHR. These findings provide a framework to suggest a mechanism whereby chronic heart failure leads to skeletal muscle pathologies; prolonged dysregulation of the molecular clock in skeletal muscle results in altered Clock.

Although this signaling pathway has been the subject of much study. the molecular mechanisms linking IGF‐1 binding to mTOR activation remain poorly defined in muscle. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that IGF‐1 activation of mTOR in C2C12 myotubes requires a phosphorylation‐dependent. altered distribution of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1/TSC2 complex from the membrane to the cytosol. We found that IGF‐1 treatment does not affect complex formation between TSC1 and TSC2. but rather IGF‐1 induces an altered distribution of the TSC1/TSC2 complex in C2C12 myotubes.

Our aim was to investigate the functional role of CaN as a regulator of muscle growth and/or muscle fiber type under conditions of recovery from inactivity. METHODS: Female ICR mice (8 wk of age. 28-32 g) were used. To examine the effects of hindlimb suspension (HS) and reloading on skeletal muscle fiber size and muscle fiber type. animals were designated to 8 wk of HS and subsequent reloading for 4 wk. During reloading. animals were treated with pharmacological inhibitors for CaN (FK506) by intraperitoneal administration (3-5 mg. kg. d). After each experimental period. antigravitational soleus muscle was analyzed. RESULTS: HS treatment resulted in obvious muscle atrophy and slow-to-fast fiber-type transformation in the soleus muscle. Subsequent reloading for 4 wk following HS induced muscle regrowth and fiber-type reversion toward a slow profile. FK506 administration prevented this kind of reloading-induced transformation of muscle fiber type. Furthermore. it was confirmed that FK506 administration attenuated maintenance of fiber cross-sectional area and reloading-induced fiber regrowth. specifically in slow-type muscle fibers. CONCLUSION: Reloading-induced fiber-type reversion toward a slow profile is prevented by the pharmacological inhibition of CaN. Additionally. inhibition of CaN prevented maintenance and regrowth of slow-type muscle fibers. These results implicate that the CaN signaling pathway is required in the slow-type muscle fiber program under …,True,JcGtlSQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,35,https://europepmc.org/article/med/16775546,16020534112511597650,/scholar?cites=16020534112511597650,,,0,0,0

Here we investigated the effect of treatment with a CaN-specific inhibitor. FK506. on skeletal muscle fiber-type transition in functionally overloaded muscles. The overloaded plantaris muscle showed fast-to-slow muscle fiber type transition. ie. a decrease in myosin heavy chain (MHC) IIb. an increase in MHCIIa+ d/x. and new expression of MHCI. In the FK506-administered group. however. overload-induced muscle fiber-type transition was completely prevented.

Although disregarded for many years. there is increasing experimental evidence demonstrating that oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) makes a significant contribution to ATP supply in many cancer cell types and under a variety of conditions. Substrates oxidized by normal mitochondria such as amino acids and fatty acids are also avidly consumed by cancer cells. In this regard. the proposal that cancer cells metabolize glutamine for anabolic purposes without the need for a functional respiratory chain and OxPhos is analyzed considering thermodynamic and kinetic aspects for the reductive carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase.

It was found that the uptake of the dye into the cytoplasmic compartment was translated into an increased fluorescence. and the uptake by the mitochondria produced a quenching of the fluorescence. The experiments to measure uptake showed that a large amount of the dye was taken up by the cells under “deenergized” conditions. The uptake of the cyanine. however. was significantly reduced by the omission of the substrate. by deenergization of the mitochondria. or by the addition of K+. but not by Na+.

This protein export pathway is used by two different bacterial nanomachines: the flagellum and the injectisome. An indispensable component of these secretion systems is an ATPase similar to the F1-ATPase β subunit. Here we characterize EscN. an enteropathogenic Escherichia coli type III ATPase. A recombinant version of EscN. which was fully functional in complementation tests. was purified to homogeneity. Our results demonstrate that EscN is a Mg2+-dependent ATPase (kcat 0.35 s−1). We also define optimal conditions for the hydrolysis reaction.

Structure. stability and dynamics,1996,Magdalena Eriksson and Peter E Nielsen,29,,4,369-394,Cambridge University Press,Growing interest in gene targeting drugs has inspired the development of a multitude of nucleic acid analogues. many of which feature substitutions in the phosphodiester moiety of the backbone (reviewed by Mesmaeker et al. 1995 and Nielsen. 1995). Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is an example of a more radical redesign of DNA. The entire sugar-phosphate backbone is substituted by a chain of peptide-like N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units so that an achiral and uncharged DNA-mimic is obtained (Fig. 1; Nielsen et al. 1991). The synthesis is based on standard peptide chemistry (Christensen et al. 1995) and has been automated. PNA can relatively easily be modified to include modifications of the backbone as well as of the bases (Hyrup & Nielsen. 1996). PNA is chemically stable and. in contrast to natural nucleic acids and peptides.

The preferred helicity of such a duplex is determined by a chiral amino acidattached to the C-terminus. We here show that the induced helicity. as measured by circular dichroism (CD). is drastically dependent on the nucleobase sequence proximal to the chiral center. Chemically linked PNA tetramer duplexes of all 16 combinations of the two bases proximal to a carboxy terminal lysine residue were studied by CD. We conclude that the base next to the chiral center must be either a guanine or a cytosine for efficientstabilization of one helical sense. In case of cytosine. the subsequent base should preferably be a purine. We also show that the side chain properties of the C-terminal amino acid influence the resulting sense of helicity.

Microcephaly is the outcome of a smaller but architecturally normal brain; the cerebral cortex exhibits a significant decrease in size. MCPH is a neurogenic mitotic disorder. though affected patients demonstrate normal neuronal migration. neuronal apoptosis and neural function.

Numerous evidences have established the role of neuroinflammation in the AD and PD pathology. The inflammatory components such as microglia. astrocytes. complement system and cytokines are linked to neuroinflammation in the CNS. More specifically. cytokines have been found to play a central role in the neuroinflammation of AD and PD.

Multiple biological processes are linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as depletion or insufficient synthesis of neurotransmitters. oxidative stress. abnormal ubiquitination. Furthermore. damaging of blood brain barrier (BBB) in the CNS also leads to various CNS-related diseases. Even though synthetic drugs are used for the management of Alzheimer’s disease. Parkinson’s disease. autism. and many other chronic illnesses. they are not without side effects. The attentions of researchers have been inclined towards the phytochemicals. many of which have minimal side effects. Phytochemicals are promising therapeutic agents because many phytochemicals have anti-inflammatory. antioxidative as well as anticholinesterase activities. Various drugs of either synthetic or natural origin applied in the treatment of brain disorders need to cross the BBB before they can be used.

Cancer stem cells have been depicted as tumorigenic cells that can differentiate and self-renew. Cancer stem cells are thought to be resistant to conventional therapy like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy damage carcinomic DNA cells. Because of the ability of cancer stem cells to self-renew and reproduce malignant tumors. they are the subject of intensive research. In this review. CSCs radioresistant mechanisms which include DNA damage response and natural radiosensitizers have been summed up. Reactive oxygen species play an important role in different physiological processes. ROS scavenging is responsible for regulation of reactive oxygen species generation. A researcher has proved that microRNAs regulate tumor radiation resistance. Ionizing radiation does not kill the cancer cells; rather. IR just slows down the signs and symptoms. Ionizing radiation damages DNA directly/indirectly. IR is given mostly in combination with other chemo/radiotherapies. We briefly described here the behavior of cancer stem cells and radioresistance therapies in cancer treatment. To overcome radioresistance in treatment of cancer. strategies like fractionation modification. treatment in combination. inflammation modification. and overcoming hypoxic tumor have been practiced.

Inc.,The proteasome is the primary contributor in intracellular proteolysis. Oxidized or unstructured proteins can be degraded via a ubiquitin- and ATP-independent process by the free 20S proteasome (20SPT). The mechanism by which these proteins enter the catalytic chamber is not understood thus far. although the 20SPT gating conformation is considered to be an important barrier to allowing proteins free entrance. We have previously shown that S-glutathiolation of the 20SPT is a post-translational modification affecting the proteasomal activities. Aims: The goal of this work was to investigate the mechanism that regulates 20SPT activity. which includes the identification of the Cys residues prone to S-glutathiolation. Results: Modulation of 20SPT activity by proteasome gating is at least partially due to the S-glutathiolation of specific Cys residues.

Rhodnius prolixus. Increased urate levels are observed in the days following a blood meal. Injecting hemin into the hemocoel increases both urate titer and TBARS formation in the hemolymph. The urate response to hemin injection seems to arise from increased synthesis by the fat body as urate secretion by this organ is stimulated in vitro by incubation with hemin. and markedly counteracted by allopurinol. Allopurinol injection also results in increased TBARS formation in the hemolymph. High O2 atmospheric conditions also increases hemolymph urate levels. confirming that urate release represents an antioxidant response.

Many technologies have been developed for the measurement of this protein adduct including immunoassays. high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. and a newly developed isotope-dilution mass spectrometry method. Irrespective of the technology used to determine this adduct level. an important question remains about the long-term stability of this damage product in stored samples. To address this issue. 19 human serum samples that had been previously analyzed for the aflatoxin B1-lysine adduct by high-performance liquid chromatography–fluorescence in 1989 were re-analyzed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry after storage at −80°C. The adduct concentrations measured by these two …,True,iS2dgNAAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,66,https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/17/6/1436.short,8297244524545156735,/scholar?cites=8297244524545156735,,https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/cebp/17/6/1436.full.pdf,0,0,0

Digestion of adducted albumin releases AFB1-lysine. a biomarker of exposure status. AF-albumin adducts have been most frequently measured in precipitated serum albumin using an immunoassay (ELISA); however. a sensitive and specific isotope dilution mass spectrometric (IDMS) assay for measurement of AFB1-lysine in serum has recently been developed. The ELISA and IDMS methods were compared using 20 human sera collected in Guinea. West Africa. where AF exposure is endemic. Measurement of AFB1-lysine adduct concentrations by IDMS in serum and albumin precipitated from the same sample revealed that precipitation has no effect on the measured adduct levels.

Heidelberg,Iron metabolism is essential for cell function and potentially toxic because iron can catalyze oxygen radical production. Malaria-attributable anemia and iron deficiency anemia coincide as being treatable diseases in the developing world. In absolute amounts. more than 95% of Plasmodium metal biochemistry occurs in the acidic digestive vacuole where heme released from hemoglobin catabolism forms heme crystals. The antimalarial quinolines interfere with crystallization. Despite the completion of the Plasmodium genome. many ‘gene gaps’ exist in components of the metal pathways described in mammalian or yeast cells. Present evidence suggests that parasite bioavailable iron originates from a labile erythrocyte cytosolic pool rather than from abundant heme iron. Indeed the parasite has to make its own heme within two separate organelles. the mitochondrion and the apicomplast.

Environmental ultraviolet rays (UV) from the sun might potentially play a more active role in regulating several important biological responses in the context of global warming. UV rays first encounter the uppermost epidermal keratinocytes causing apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms of UV-induced apoptosis of keratinocytes include direct DNA damage (intrinsic). clustering of death receptors on the cell surface (extrinsic). and generation of ROS. When apoptotic keratinocytes are processed by adjacent immature Langerhans cells (LCs). the inappropriately activated Langerhans cells could result in immunosuppression. Furthermore. UV can deplete LCs in the epidermis and impair their migratory capacity. leading to their accumulation in the dermis. Intriguingly. receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) activation of LCs by UV can induce the pro-survival and anti-apoptotic signals due to the upregulation of Bcl-xL. leading to the generation of regulatory T cells. Meanwhile. a physiological dosage of UV can also enhance melanocyte survival and melanogenesis. Analogous to its effect in keratinocytes. a therapeutic dosage of UV can induce cell cycle arrest. activate antioxidant and DNA repair enzymes. and induce apoptosis through translocation of the Bcl-2 family proteins in melanocytes to ensure genomic integrity and survival of melanocytes. Furthermore. UV can elicit the synthesis of vitamin D. an important molecule in calcium homeostasis of various types of skin cells contributing to DNA repair and …,True,taQytHIAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,192,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/14/3/6414,12619830842281776515,/scholar?cites=12619830842281776515,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/14/3/6414/pdf,0,0,0

In order to unravel the molecular mechanism involved in the alteration of energy metabolism under oxidative stress. we treated normal human skin fibroblasts (CCD-966SK cells) with sub-lethal doses of H2O2. The results showed that several glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase type II (HK II). lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) were up-regulated in H2O2-treated normal skin fibroblasts.

During the aging process. a wide spectrum of alterations in mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been observed in somatic tissues of humans and animals. This is associated with the decline in mitochondrial respiratory function; excess production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS); increase in the oxidative damage to mtDNA. lipids and proteins in mitochondria; accumulation of point mutations and large-scale deletions of mtDNA; and altered expression of genes involved in intermediary metabolism. It has been demonstrated that the ROS may cause oxidative damage and mutations of mtDNA and alterations of the expression of several clusters of genes in aging tissues and senescent cells. We found that intracellular levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxidative damage to DNA in the tissue cells and skin fibroblasts of old donors were higher than those of young donors. In H2O2-induced senescent skin fibroblasts. we observed an increase in the protein expression and activity levels of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase and a concurrent decrease in the activity of cytochrome c oxidase and the rate of oxygen consumption. Moreover. the mRNA and protein expression levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were decreased but those of PDH kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were increased in senescent skin fibroblasts.

Two-component system (TCS) signal transduction pathways are the dominant mechanisms by which micro-organisms sense and respond to external as well as internal environmental changes. These systems respond to a wide range of stimuli by triggering diverse physiological adjustments. including alterations in gene expression. enzymatic reactions. or protein-protein interactions. We present P2CS (Prokaryotic 2-Component Systems). an integrated and comprehensive database of TCS signal transduction proteins. which contains a compilation of the TCS genes within 755 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes and 39 metagenomes. P2CS provides detailed annotation of each TCS gene including family classification. sequence features. functional domains. as well as genomic context visualization. To bypass the generic problem of gene underestimation during genome annotation. we also constituted and searched an ORFeome. which improves the recovery of TCS proteins compared to searches on the equivalent proteomes.

1031117,The genetic organisation of prokaryotic two-component system signalling pathways,2010,Robert HN Williams and David E Whitworth,11,BMC genomics,1,1-12,BioMed Central,Two-component systems (TCSs) are modular and diverse signalling pathways. involving a stimulus-responsive transfer of phosphoryl groups from transmitter to partner receiver domains. TCS gene and domain organisation are both potentially informative regarding biological function. interaction partnerships and molecular mechanisms. However. there is currently little understanding of the relationships between domain architecture. gene organisation and TCS pathway structure. Here we classify the gene and domain organisation of TCS gene loci from 1405 prokaryotic replicons (>40.000 TCS proteins). We find that 200 bp is the most appropriate distance cut-off for defining whether two TCS genes are functionally linked.

Carrying out these reactions at rates that exceed the rate of solar insolation for the extended periods of time required for useful applications presents a major challenge. Water oxidation is the key “other” half reaction in these schemes and it is dominated by PCET given its multi-electron. multi-proton character. 2H2O → O2 + 4e− + 4H+. Identification of PCET was an offshoot of experiments designed to investigate energy conversion by electron transfer quenching of molecular excited states.

An important issue is how excited state reactivity can be integrated with PCET to carry out solar fuel reactions such as water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen or water reduction of CO2 to methanol or hydrocarbons. The principles behind PCET and concerted electron–proton transfer (EPT) pathways are reasonably well understood.

However. the reliance on fossil fuels leads to the significant depletion of natural resources of buried combustible geologic deposits and to negative effects on the global climate with emissions of greenhouse gases. Accordingly. enormous efforts are directed to transition from fossil fuels to nonpolluting and renewable energy sources. One potential alternative is biohydrogen (H 2). a clean energy carrier with high-energy yields; upon the combustion of H 2. H 2 O is the only major by-product. In recent decades. the attractive and renewable characteristics of H 2 led us to develop a variety of biological routes for the production of H 2. Based on the mode of H 2 generation. the biological routes for H 2 production are categorized into four groups: photobiological fermentation. anaerobic fermentation. enzymatic and microbial electrolysis. and a combination of these processes. Thus. this review primarily focuses on the evaluation of the biological routes for the production of H 2. In particular. we assess the efficiency and feasibility of these bioprocesses with respect to the factors that affect operations. and we delineate the limitations. Additionally. alternative options such as bioaugmentation. multiple process integration. and microbial electrolysis to improve process efficiency are discussed to address industrial-level applications.

Each subunit in hPAH contains an N-terminal regulatory domain (Ser2−Ser110). a catalytic domain (Asp112−Arg410). and an oligomerization domain (Ser411−Lys452) including dimerization and tetramerization motifs. Two partially overlapping transitions are seen in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms for wild-type hPAH in 0.1 M Na−Hepes buffer. 0.1 M NaCl. pH 7.0. Although these transitions are irreversible. studies on their scan-rate dependence support that the equilibrium thermodynamics analysis is permissible in this case.

The present results show that gastric lipase also acts in solution on vinyl butyrate. with an optimum activity above pH 7. which suggests that gastric lipase is able to hydrolyze ester bonds via the classical mechanism of serine hydrolases. These results support previous structural studies in which the catalytic triad of gastric lipase was reported to show no specific features. The optimum activity of gastric lipase shifted toward lower pH values. however. when the vinyl butyrate concentration was greater than the solubility limit. Experiments performed with long-chain triglycerides showed that gastric lipase binds optimally to the oil−water interface at low pH values.

The lectin administered prophylactically before tumour implantation regressed tumour size. however. this activity was less potent than that of the A. vera leaf pulp extract previously shown in our laboratory. Accordingly. serum sialic acid and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) levels. chosen as tumour markers. were decreased significantly by the prophylactic administration of the lectin. The increase in spleen and thymus weights in the group given only Aloctin I. could be explained by the immunomodulatory and mitogenic effects of lectins.

As a result. the monitoring of phosphoproteins in cells represents an important goal for proteomics research. To facilitate phosphoprotein detection. the first enzymatic phosphorylation-dependent biotinylation reaction of proteins is described. Specifically. kinase enzymes were coupled with an ATP-biotin conjugate to efficiently biotinylate substrate peptides and proteins after phosphate transfer. The kinase-mediated biotinylation reaction enables efficient detection of phosphoproteins in cell lysates or phosphopeptides after trypsin proteolysis. demonstrating its utility for proteomics research.

We have recently developed a SECIS-free selenoprotein synthesis system that site-specifically—using the UAG amber codon—inserts Sec depending on the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Here. we describe the engineering of EF-Tu for improved selenoprotein synthesis. A Sec-specific selection system was established by expression of human protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (hAGT). in which the active site cysteine codon has been replaced by the UAG amber codon.

1031194,Taxonomy of methanogens,2010,Y Liu,,,,547-558,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Methanogens are strictly anaerobic. methane-producing Archaea. They all belong to the phylum Euryarchaeota. Although methanogens share a set of physiological characteristics. they are phylogenetically very diverse. The current taxonomy classifies methanogens into five well-established orders: Methanobacteriales. Methanococcales. Methanomicrobiales. Methanosarcinales. and Methanopyrales. This taxonomy is supported by 16S rRNA gene sequences as well as a number of physiological properties. e.g.. substrates for methanogenesis. nutritional requirements. morphologies. and structures of cell envelopes. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the strain SANAE. a representative of the clone lineage Rice Cluster I. suggests that it represents a novel order of methanogens. Methanocellales. Methanogens are abundant in a wide variety of anaerobic environments where they catalyze the terminal step in the anaerobic food chain by converting methanogenic substrates into methane. The complexity of methanogenesis pathways suggests an ancient monophyletic origin of methanogens. a hypothesis. which is supported by phylogenetic analyses based upon DNA sequences.,True,JzEycd4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,37,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.springer-08fb18bf-7d43-3c86-8958-c11ddb4e33f9,8213774787778411255,/scholar?cites=8213774787778411255,,,0,0,0

EHEC-induced reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). a measure of barrier function disruption. is significantly slower and more modest in comparison to that induced by EPEC.

1031210,A structural view on the mechanism of the ribosome-catalyzed peptide bond formation,2009,Miljan Simonović and Thomas A Steitz,1789,,9-10,612-623,Elsevier,The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein particle that translates genetic information encoded in mRNA into specific proteins. Its highly conserved active site. the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC). is located on the large (50S) ribosomal subunit and is comprised solely of rRNA. which makes the ribosome the only natural ribozyme with polymerase activity. The last decade witnessed a rapid accumulation of atomic-resolution structural data on both ribosomal subunits as well as on the entire ribosome. This has allowed studies on the mechanism of peptide bond formation at a level of detail that surpasses that for the classical protein enzymes. A current understanding of the mechanism of the ribosome-catalyzed peptide bond formation is the focus of this review.

Indeed. the time- and dose-dependent increase of apoptosis is associated to an early enhancement of the reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) plays a crucial role in the defence against ROS. thus protecting against several apoptotic stimuli. Diclofenac decreased the protein levels and the enzymatic activity of SOD2. without any significant impairment of the corresponding mRNA levels in the SH-SY5Y extracts. When cells were incubated with an archaeal exogenous thioredoxin. an attenuation of the diclofenac-induced apoptosis was observed. together with an increase of SOD2 protein levels. Furthermore. diclofenac impaired the mitochondrial membrane potential. leading to a release of cytochrome c.

However. the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not completely understood. One mechanism that has been suggested is induction of phase II detoxification enzymes. Expression of phase II enzymes is regulated by the antioxidant response element (ARE) and the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2-related factor 2). In this study. we determined the role of this transcription system in the induction of phase II enzymes by carotenoids.

Some of the motors operate within the nucleus to assemble and elongate the bipolar spindle. Others operate on the cytoplasmic microtubules to effect spindle and nuclear positioning within the cell. This study reveals that kinesin-related Kar3p and Kip3p are unique in that they perform roles both inside and outside the nucleus. Kar3p. like Kip3p. was found to be required for spindle positioning in the absence of dynein. The spindle positioning role of Kar3p is performed in concert with the Cik1p accessory factor. but not the homologous Vik1p. Kar3p and Kip3p were also found to overlap for a function essential for the structural integrity of the bipolar spindle.

In quasistatic cycling experiments. samples containing SP-A require less compression to achieve low surface tensions even during the first compression cycle.

However. conversely. plant growth can also be induced by treatments with various abiotic and biotic elicitors. Carrageenans are sulfated linear polysaccharides that represent major cellular constituents of seaweeds belonging to red algae (Rhodophyta). Recent research has unraveled the biological activity of carrageenans and of their oligomeric forms. the oligo carrageenans (OCs). as promoters of plant growth and as elicitors of defense responses against pests and diseases. In this review. we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which carrageenans and OCs mediate plant growth and plant defense responses. Carrageenans and OCs improve plant growth by regulating various metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and ancillary pathways. cell division. purine and pyrimidine synthetic pathways as well as metabolic pathways involved in nitrogen and sulfur assimilation. Carrageenans and OCs also induce plant defense responses against viroids. viruses. bacteria. fungi and insects by modulating the activity of different defense pathways. including salicylate. jasmonate and ethylene signaling pathways. Further studies will likely substantiate the beneficial effects of carrageenans and of OCs on plant growth and plant defense responses and open new avenues for their use in agriculture and horticultural industry.,True,qTCL_-gAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,56,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2016.00081/full,5726109113585419612,/scholar?cites=5726109113585419612,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2016.00081/full,0,0,0

In the secretory pathway the folding status of glycoproteins passing through the endoplasmic reticulum is marked by the composition of the N-glycan. The different glycoforms are recognized by specialized lectins. The folding sensor UGGT acts as an unusual molecular chaperone and covalently modifies the Man9 N-glycan of a misfolded protein by adding a glucose moiety and converts it to Glc1Man9 that rebinds the lectin calnexin. However. further links between the folding status of a glycoprotein and the composition of the N-glycan are unclear.

While the underlying mechanisms vary. overexpression of WNTs was found to mediate active signalling in some of these diseases. Other cancers show a mutation in pathway members further downstream. such as APC. Axin or β-catenin. leading to aberrant signalling activation. Another mechanism initiating activation of WNT/β-catenin signalling is the silencing of expression of negative WNT/β-catenin regulators. such as DKK and WIF1. by. for example. promoter hypermethylation.

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) possesses a role in this apoptotic block. although underlying functional mechanisms and the involvement of the microenvironment are unclear. In this study. the VEGF status in CLL was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence. VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) phosphorylation was determined flow cytometrically and by immunofluorescence. For co-culture. CLL cells were cultivated on a monolayer of the bone marrow-derived stromal cell (BMSC) line HS5. Secreted VEGF was neutralized using the monoclonal antibody mAb293 (R&D Systems. Minneapolis. MN. USA). To block protein secretion. we used Brefeldin A. VEGF was downregulated in BMSCs by small interfering RNA (siRNA). and we assessed survival by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining. CLL cells express and secrete VEGF and possess phosphorylated VEGFR2. This positive VEGF status is not sufficient to prevent spontaneous apoptosis in vitro. Coculture with BMSCs. which secrete vast amounts of VEGF. maintains in vitro CLL cell survival. Blockage of secreted VEGF using the monoclonal antibody mAb293 significantly reduced the survival support for cocultured CLL cells. Both general blockage of protein secretion by Brefeldin A in BMSCs. but not in CLL cells. and siRNA-mediated downregulation of VEGF in BMSCs. significantly reduced the coculture-mediated survival support for CLL cells.

I present several studies that dispute this contention and two studies that suggest that passive diffusion is of little practical significance. even in young children.

Steps regulated by these hormones were defined by measuring transcriptional activity with the nuclear run-on assay and multiple fragments of the malic enzyme gene as probes. T3 alone caused a significant increase in transcription within 1 h. with a maximal increase of 30-40-fold occurring by 24 h. When T3 was added with insulin. 80% of the maximum rate was reached in 1 h. Insulin alone had no effect on transcription of the malic enzyme gene; it amplified the response to T3 in the first few hours after adding T3 but did not alter T3's maximal effect.

Our data suggest that CDT is secreted to the bacterial culture supernatant via outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released from the bacteria. All three subunits (the CdtA. CdtB. and CdtC proteins) were detected by immunogold labeling and electron microscopy of OMVs. Subcellular fractionation of the bacteria indicated that. apart from the majority of CDT detected in the cytoplasmic compartment. appreciable amounts (20-50%) of the cellular pool of CDT proteins were present in the periplasmic compartment. In the bacterial culture supernatant. we found that a majority of the extracellular CDT was tightly associated with the OMVs. Isolated OMVs could exert the cell distending effects typical of CDT on a human intestinal cell line. indicating that CDT is present there in a biologically active form. Our results strongly suggest that the release of outer membrane vesicles is functioning as a route of C. jejuni to deliver all the subunits of CDT toxin (CdtA.

It secretes the protease PrtV. which protects the bacterium from invertebrate predators but reduces the ability of Vibrio-secreted factor(s) to induce interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by human intestinal epithelial cells. The aim was to identify the secreted component(s) of V. cholerae that induces an epithelial inflammatory response and to define whether it is a substrate for PrtV.  Methodology/Principal Findings Culture supernatants of wild type V. cholerae O1 strain C6706. its derivatives and pure V. cholerae cytolysin (VCC) were analyzed for the capacity to induce changes in cytokine mRNA expression levels. IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion. permeability and cell viability when added to the apical side of polarized tight monolayer T84 cells used as an in vitro model for human intestinal epithelium. Culture supernatants were also analyzed for hemolytic activity and for the presence of PrtV and VCC by immunoblot analysis.  Conclusions/Significance We suggest that VCC is capable of causing an inflammatory response characterized by increased permeability and production of IL-8 and TNF-α in tight monolayers. Pure VCC at a concentration of 160 ng/ml caused an inflammatory response that reached the magnitude of that caused by Vibrio-secreted factors. while higher concentrations caused epithelial cell death. The inflammatory response was totally abolished by treatment with PrtV. The findings suggest that low doses of VCC initiate a local immune defense reaction while high doses lead to intestinal epithelial lesions. Furthermore.

This study investigated the temporal and anatomical distributions of amyloid-β and tau abnormalities from 1 h to 24 h post injury in the same model. Intra-axonal amyloid-β accumulation in the fimbria was detected as early as 1 hour and increased monotonically over 24 hours following injury. Tau immunoreactivity in the fimbria and amygdala had a biphasic time course with peaks at 1 hour and 24 hours. while tau immunoreactivity in the contralateral CA1 rose in a delayed fashion starting at 12 hours after injury. Furthermore. rapid intra-axonal amyloid-β accumulation was similarly observed post controlled cortical injury in APP/PS1 mice. another transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model.

The two partially unfolded forms show the same secondary structure and similar tryptophanyl fluorescence emission and polarization but exhibit marked differences in the tyrosine contributions to the near-ultraviolet circular dichroism and in the degree of solvent accessibility to tyrosyl residues. The molecular characterization of the two structural forms indicates that acids disorganize the 80–146 molecular domain identified in the myoglobin molecule to a great extent with respect to that induced by low guanidine concentration. whereas the structure of the 1–79 domain appears to be quite similar in the two molecular forms.,True,ud22E00AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,102,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003986186906144,5750271406633502995,/scholar?cites=5750271406633502995,,,0,0,0

The majority of glutathione redox research has been based on the chemical analysis of whole-cell extracts. which unavoidably destroy subcellular compartment–specific information.

However. until recently. the study of these processes has been impeded by a lack of appropriate tools and methodologies that afford the necessary redox species specificity and spatiotemporal resolution. Recently developed genetically encoded fluorescent redox probes now allow dynamic real-time measurements. of defined redox species. with subcellular compartment resolution. in intact living cells.

Bothrops snakes account for most snake bites in humans. and the recommended treatment is administration of multispecific Bothrops antivenom (SAB – soro antibotrópico). However. Bothrops snakes are very diverse with regard to their venom composition. which raises the issue of which venoms should be used as immunizing antigens for the production of pan-specific Bothrops antivenoms. In this study. we simultaneously compared the composition and reactivity with SAB of venoms collected from six species of snakes. distributed in pairs from three distinct phylogenetic clades: Bothrops. Bothropoides and Rhinocerophis. We also evaluated the neutralization of Bothrops atrox venom. which is the species responsible for most snake bites in the Amazon region. but not included in the immunization antigen mixture used to produce SAB.

Highly crosslinked hydrogels containing amine-terminated functionalities were formed and used to covalently attach antibodies specific for staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB).

METHODOLOGY: We have studied 44 gastric cancer patients submitted to surgery. There were 13 proximal tumors. 16 located in the middle third and 15 in the distal one. Overall survival was 26% at 6 years. Metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase concentrations were investigated by means of ELISA in frozen samples of tumoral and normal gastric mucosa. RESULTS: Mean concentration of metalloproteinase-9 in tumoral tissue was 42 ng/mg of total protein. and this value was 6.9 times greater than the mean concentration in non-tumoral tissue. Cancer tissue also expressed higher levels of TIMP-1. 7.25 versus 4.39 ng/mg of protein. Higher levels of metalloproteinase expression in tumoral tissue. greater [metalloproteinase in tumor]/[metalloproteinase in non-tumor] ratio and greater [metalloproteinase]/[inhibitor] ratio in tumor cells. were all of them statistically related to a worse prognosis when T1 and T2 tumors were considered.

Using our modified reaction conditions and the mixed-phase assay. less than 0.000010 unit of CAT activity in transfected cells can be reliably detected. The mixed-phase assay is based on the inability of the polar [3H] acetyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) substrate to partition out of a urea containing aqueous phase into the nonpolar scintillation fluor. while the [3H] chloramphenicol reaction products partition into the toluene scintillation fluor and are quantitated by scintillation counting. The increased sensitivity of this assay is due to the optimization of the acetyl-CoA concentration. to a urea-containing aqueous phase which lowers the assay background. and to the use of extract blanks.

Deletion of either ERE effectively abolishes estrogen-dependent transcription of the vitellogenin promoter. Neither replacement of the two imperfect EREs with a single consensus ERE at -334. nor insertion of one or two consensus EREs at -359. restores full estrogen responsiveness to the mutant promoter. In competition gel mobility shift assays using the DNA binding domain of the Xenopus estrogen receptor. the consensus ERE was a severalfold more effective competitor than the two imperfect B1 EREs.

Studies using the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 indicated that attenuation of apoptosis was mediated through glucocorticoid receptors. Dexamethasone not only suppressed the apoptosis-associated upregulation of Bcl-xS but also enhanced the basal level of Bcl-xL in the cells. In addition. bcl-x mRNA stability was significantly extended in the presence of dexamethasone.

1031928,Effect and mechanism of ginsenosides CK and Rg1 on stimulation of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes,2010,Yu-Chuan Huang and Cheng-Yu Lin and Su-Fen Huang and Han-Ching Lin and Wen-Liang Chang and Tsu-Chung Chang,58,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,10,6039-6047,American Chemical Society,The glucoregulatory activities of ginsenosides compound K (CK) and Rg1 were investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Both compounds significantly enhanced glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose−response manner. which is correlated with increased GLUT4 translocation from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane in adipocytes. The stimulating effects of CK and Rg1 on glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation are associated with activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways; both are key pathways in mediating glucose uptake in animal cells.

High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is the most lethal form of high altitude illness. The present study was designed to investigate the ability of Rhodiola crenulata extract (RCE). an herbal medicine traditionally used as an antiacute mountain sickness remedy. to attenuate hypoxia-induced pulmonary injury. Exposure of animals to hypobaric hypoxia led to a significant increase in pathological indicators for pulmonary edema. including the lung water content. disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier. and protein-rich fluid in the lungs. In addition. hypobaric hypoxia also increased oxidative stress markers. including (ROS) production. (MDA) level. and (MPO) activity. Furthermore. overexpression of plasma (ET-1). (VEGF) in (BALF). and (HIF-1α) in lung tissue was also found. However. pretreatment with RCE relieved the HAPE findings by curtailing all of the hypoxia-induced lung injury parameters. These findings suggest that RCE confers effective protection for maintaining the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier by alleviating the elevated ET-1 and VEGF levels; it does so by reducing hypoxia-induced oxidative stress.

The activities of CAPE and its novel synthetic derivatives. caffeic acid octyl ester (CAO) and 1-octyl caffeamide (CAN-8). were investigated in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cultured human cells were incubated with or without these compounds. The effect of these compounds on cell apoptosis. intracellular level of hydrogen peroxide and mitochondrial potential were analyzed. Western blot analysis was used to study the effect of alterations in protein level of caspases. Bcl-2 family. p21. p53 and c-Jun upon drug treatment. RESULTS: These compounds arrested cell proliferation. triggered cell apoptosis and caused a marked scavenging effect of hydrogen peroxide. Apoptosis induced by CAPE or CAO is associated with increased expression of p53. p21 and c-Jun. While the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were relatively unchanged. these compounds induced a marked reduction in Mcl-1 level. The CAPE-or CAO-induced apoptosis was also accompanied by a rapid loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8. suggesting a mitochondrial-dependent mechanism. In causing these cellular actions. CAO was shown to be comparable or more potent than CAPE. whereas the amide analogue CAN-8 displayed much weaker activities than both CAPE and CAO.

1031947,How algae produce hydrogen—news from the photosynthetic hydrogenase,2009,Sven T Stripp and Thomas Happe,,,45,9960-9969,Royal Society of Chemistry,Green algae are the only known eukaryotes capable of oxygenic photosynthesis which are equipped with a hydrogen metabolism. Hydrogen production is light-dependent. since the [FeFe] hydrogenases are coupled to the photosynthetic electron transport chain via ferredoxin. Algal [FeFe] hydrogenases are one of the most active biocatalysts for the evolution of hydrogen. Therefore. special interest exists in the biophysical characterization and biotechnological usage of these [Fe-S] enzymes. This review traces the discovery of this interesting class of proteins. Recent findings allow insight into the electronic structure and configuration of the [FeFe] hydrogenase active site (H-cluster). Emphasis is placed on novel discoveries of the hydrogenase interaction with its natural electron donor ferredoxin and the mechanism of enzyme inactivation through oxygen.,True,ZtfyzRoAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,81,https://pubs.rsc.org/lv/content/articlehtml/2009/dt/b916246a,10042070683259402572,/scholar?cites=10042070683259402572,,http://jupiter.chem.uoa.gr/thanost/papers/papers7/DT_2009_B916246A.pdf,0,0,0

Three of the four presumed catalytic intermediates (H ox. H red/H red and H sred) were characterized. using various spectroscopic techniques. However. in catalytically active enzyme. the state containing the hydrido-species. which is eponymous for the proposed heterolytic mechanism. has yet only been speculated about.

Due to the absence of additional FeS clusters as found in bacterial [FeFe] hydrogenases. it was possible to specifically study its catalytic iron−sulfur cluster (H-cluster) by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Fe K-edge. The XAS analysis revealed that the CrHydA1 H-cluster consists of a [4Fe4S] cluster and a diiron site. 2FeH. which both are similar to their crystallographically characterized bacterial counterparts. Determination of the individual Fe−Fe distances in the [4Fe4S] cluster (∼2.7 Å) and in the 2FeH unit (∼2.5 Å) was achieved.

The FDX genes are differentially expressed under various environmental conditions such as the availability of oxygen. copper. iron and ammonium. Recently. the anaerobically induced Fdx5 as well as Fdx2. which is involved in nitrite reduction were characterized in more detail. Moreover. it was shown that PetF. the central and most abundant FDX of C. reinhardtii. is a suitable partner of the hydrogenase HydA1. Using mutant variants of both PetF and HydA1. amino acid residues essential for the interaction of both proteins could be identified.

Thus. a precursor of the whole H-cluster is assembled on HydF.

Barley leaves are not cyanogenic. i.e. they do not possess the ability to release hydrogen cyanide. because they lack a cyanide releasing β-d-glucosidase. Cyanogenesis was reconstituted in barley leaf epidermal cells through single cell expression of a cDNA encoding dhurrinase-2. a cyanogenic β-d-glucosidase from sorghum. This resulted in a 35–60% reduction in colonization rate by an obligate parasite Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei. the causal agent of barley powdery mildew.

Although it has been known for over 30 years that complement is responsible for FHS-induced death. the link between complement activation and triggering of PCD has not been established. We have previously shown that the mitochondrion participates in the orchestration of PCD in this model. Several changes in mitochondrial function were described. and in particular it was shown that mitochondrion-derived O2•− (superoxide radical) is necessary for PCD.

Guanine is the base that is most susceptible to oxidation. due to its low redox potential. and 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is the most common lesion. These characteristics make 8-oxoG a good cellular biomarker to indicate the extent of oxidative stress. If not repaired. 8-oxoG can pair with adenine and cause a G:C to T:A transversion. When 8-oxoG is inserted during DNA replication. it could generate double-strand breaks. which makes this lesion particularly deleterious. Trypanosoma cruzi needs to address various oxidative stress situations. such as the mammalian intracellular environment and the triatomine insect gut where it replicates. We focused on the MutT enzyme. which is responsible for removing 8-oxoG from the nucleotide pool. To investigate the importance of 8-oxoG during parasite infection of mammalian cells. we characterized the MutT gene in T. cruzi (TcMTH) and generated T. cruzi parasites heterologously expressing Escherichia coli MutT or overexpressing the TcMTH enzyme. In the epimastigote form. the recombinant and wild-type parasites displayed similar growth in normal conditions. but the MutT-expressing cells were more resistant to hydrogen peroxide treatment. The recombinant parasite also displayed significantly increased growth after 48 hours of infection in fibroblasts and macrophages when compared to wild-type cells. as well as increased parasitemia in Swiss mice.

Herein. we performed a functional assessment of mitochondrial metabolism in the following two distinct evolutive forms of T. cruzi: the insect stage epimastigote and the freshly isolated bloodstream trypomastigote. We observed that in comparison to epimastigotes. bloodstream trypomastigotes facilitate the entry of electrons into the electron transport chain by increasing complex II-III activity.

Recent discoveries in several filamentous fungi suggest mechanisms for the clustering and co-regulation of secondary metabolite genes or pathogenicity islands. An extreme case of this may be fungal ‘accessory’. ‘conditionally dispensable’. or ‘supernumerary’ chromosomes that often confer beneficial traits. Fungal supernumerary chromosomes may be derived by similar mechanisms as animal or plant B chromosomes. and we thus propose that this term should be reconsidered to capture the wide variety of fungal accessory chromosomes. In some fungi. both the ‘ends’ of chromosomes and these ‘odd B chromosomes are enriched with a silencing histone modification.

We first found that Lcn2 levels were consistently associated with invasive breast cancer in human tissue and urine samples. To investigate the function of Lcn2 in breast cancer progression. Lcn2 was overexpressed in human breast cancer cells and was found to up-regulate mesenchymal markers. including vimentin and fibronectin. down-regulate the epithelial marker E-cadherin. and significantly increase cell motility and invasiveness. These changes in marker expression and cell motility are hallmarks of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In contrast.

Drug resistance has made development of new antimicrobials critical. Many approaches to discovering new antimicrobials. such as structure-based drug design and whole cell phenotypic screens followed by lead refinement. require high-resolution structures of proteins essential to the parasite.   Methodology/Principal Findings We experimentally identified 406 putative essential genes in B. thailandensis. a low-virulence species phylogenetically similar to B. pseudomallei. the causative agent of melioidosis. using saturation-level transposon mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing (Tn-seq). We selected 315 protein products of these genes based on structure-determination criteria. such as excluding very large and/or integral membrane proteins. and entered them into the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infection Disease (SSGCID) structure determination pipeline. To maximize structural coverage of these targets. we applied an “ortholog rescue” strategy for those producing insoluble or difficult to crystallize proteins. resulting in the addition of 387 orthologs (or paralogs) from seven other Burkholderia species into the SSGCID pipeline. This structural genomics approach yielded structures from 31 putative essential targets from B. thailandensis. and 25 orthologs from other Burkholderia species. yielding an overall structural coverage for 49 of the 406 essential gene families. with a total of 88 depositions into the Protein Data Bank.

Argonautes use the nucleotide sequences in miRNAs as guides for identifying target messenger RNAs for repression. Here. we used single-molecule FRET to directly visualize how human Argonaute-2 (Ago2) searches for and identifies target sites in RNAs complementary to its miRNA guide. Our results suggest that Ago2 initially scans for target sites with complementarity to nucleotides 2–4 of the miRNA.

The two forms of NEIL1 are shown here to have distinct enzymatic properties. The edited form removes thymine glycol from duplex DNA 30 times more slowly than the form encoded in the genome. whereas editing enhances repair of the guanidinohydantoin lesion by NEIL1. In addition. we show that the NEIL1 recoding site is a preferred editing site for the RNA editing adenosine deaminase ADAR1. The edited adenosine resides in an A-C mismatch in a hairpin stem formed by pairing of exon 6 to the immediate upstream intron 5 sequence. As expected for an ADAR1 site. editing at this position is increased in human cells treated with interferon α.

An enigmatic feature of many conserved mammalian miRNA target sites is that an adenosine (A) nucleotide opposite miRNA nucleotide-1 confers enhanced target repression independently of base pairing potential to the miRNA. In this study. we show that human Argonaute2 (Ago2) possesses a solvated surface pocket that specifically binds adenine nucleobases in the 1 position (t1) of target RNAs. t1A nucleotides are recognized indirectly through a hydrogen-bonding network of water molecules that preferentially interacts with the N6 amine on adenine. t1A nucleotides are not utilized during the initial binding of Ago2 to its target. but instead function by increasing the dwell time on target RNA. We also show that N6 adenosine methylation blocks t1A recognition. revealing a possible mechanism for modulation of miRNA target site potency.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07646.001,True,nOWbh_QAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,75,https://elifesciences.org/articles/07646,12555403528444509840,/scholar?cites=12555403528444509840,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/07646.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. we identified C. sinensis paramyosin (CsPmy) from the cyst wall proteins of metacercariae by proteomic approaches and characterized the expressed recombinant pET-26b-CsPmy protein (101 kDa). Bioinformatics analysis indicated that full-length sequences of paramyosin are conserved in helminthes and numerous B-cell/T-cell epitopes were predicted in amino acid sequence of CsPmy. Western blot analysis showed that CsPmy was expressed at four life stages of C. sinensis. both cyst wall proteins and soluble tegumental components could be probed by anti-CsPmy serum. Moreover. immunolocalization results revealed that CsPmy was specifically localized at cyst wall and excretory bladder of metacercaria. as well as the tegument. oral sucker and vitellarium of adult worm. Both immunoblot and immunolocalization results demonstrated that CsPmy was highly expressed at the stage of adult worm. metacercariae and cercaria. which could be supported by real-time PCR analysis. Both recombinant protein and nucleic acid of CsPmy showed strong immunogenicity in rats and induced combined Th1/Th2 immune responses. which were reflected by continuous high level of antibody titers and increased level of IgG1/IgG2a subtypes in serum.

When tested against MDA-MB-231 and HCT-8 cancer cell lines. the extracts of leaves and bark showed remarkable anti-cancer properties while surprisingly. seed extracts exhibited hardly any such properties. Cell survival was significantly low in both cells lines when treated with leaves and bark extracts. Furthermore. a striking reduction (about 70–90%) in colony formation as well as cell motility was observed upon treatment with leaves and bark. Additionally. apoptosis assay performed on these treated breast and colorectal cancer lines showed a remarkable increase in the number of apoptotic cells; with a 7 fold increase in MD-MB-231 to an increase of several fold in colorectal cancer cell lines. However. no significant apoptotic cells were detected upon seeds extract treatment.

METHODS: This nationwide cross-sectional study covered all 5 military regions of KSA. It included a multistage stratified random sample of 10.500 active military personnel. The World Health Organization STEP wise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance (STEPS) was used in the design of the data collection tool. The project lasted from January 2009 to February 2011. RESULTS: The response rate was 97.4%; 40.9% of the participants were overweight. 29% obese. and 42.4% had central obesity. Multivariate analysis revealed age. education years. and family history of diabetes or hypertension as statistically significant positive predictors of body mass index. while higher military rank. smoking. eating fruits more than twice per week. and heavy physical activities were negative predictors. CONCLUSION: Obesity is a major health problem among military personnel in this survey especially among soldiers. and is associated with unhealthy dietary and physical activity habits. Prompt action must be taken by the military medical services department in terms of intervention programs primarily directed to soldiers and overweight personnel to control obesity and mitigate its consequences.

The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamics of miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks during exercise and the subsequent recovery period. Here we monitored the transcriptome changes using microarray analysis of the whole blood of eight highly trained athletes before and after 30 min of moderate exercise followed by 30 min and 60 min of recovery period. We combined expression profiling and bioinformatics and analysed metabolic pathways enriched with differentially expressed mRNAs and mRNAs which are known to be validated targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. Finally we revealed four dynamically regulated networks comprising differentially expressed miRNAs and their known target mRNAs with anti-correlated expression profiles over time. The data suggest that hsa-miR-21-5p regulated TGFBR3. PDGFD and PPM1L mRNAs. Hsa-miR-24-2-5p was likely to be responsible for MYC and KCNJ2 genes and hsa-miR-27a-5p for ST3GAL6. The targets of hsa-miR-181a-5p included ROPN1L and SLC37A3. All these mRNAs are involved in processes highly relevant to exercise response. including immune function. apoptosis. membrane traffic of proteins and transcription regulation.

This feature indicates a key role for a simple network based on the consumption of IL-2 by T reg cells in their suppressor function. However. congenital deficiency in IL-2R results in reduced expression of the T reg cell lineage–specification factor Foxp3. which has confounded experimental efforts to understand the role of IL-2R expression and signaling in the suppressor function of T reg cells. Using genetic gain-and loss-of-function approaches. we found that capture of IL-2 was dispensable for the control of CD4+ T cells but was important for limiting the activation of CD8+ T cells. and that IL-2R-dependent activation of the transcription factor STAT5 had an essential role in the suppressor function of T reg cells separable from signaling via the T cell antigen receptor.,True,Gv9PrN0AAAAJ:FiDNX6EVdGUC,358,https://www.nature.com/articles/ni.3540,2809420702896772964,/scholar?cites=2809420702896772964,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5071159/,0,0,0

Regulatory T (Treg) cells. which express the transcription factor Foxp3. suppress fatal autoimmunity throughout the lifespan of animals. Here. we show that a dedicated Foxp3 intronic element CNS2 maintains Treg cell lineage identity by acting as a sensor of the essential Treg cell growth factor IL-2 and its downstream target STAT5. CNS2 sustains Foxp3 expression during division of mature Treg cells when IL-2 is limiting and counteracts proinflammatory cytokine signaling that leads to the loss of Foxp3.

Unfortunately. in spite of its advantages. chemistry has great disadvantages as well. Insecticides are threatening the long-term survival of major ecosystems by disruption of ecological relationships between organisms and loss of biodiversity. On the other hand. agriculture. as the largest consumer of freshwater and as a major cause of reduction of surface and groundwater resources through erosion and chemical runoff. are close related to the loss of water quality (Wauchope. 1978). The processing industry associated to agriculture is also a significant source of organic pollution in most countries. Conventionally. in most countries. all types of agricultural practices and land use. including animal farming. are treated as nonpoint sources. The main characteristics of non-point sources are not simply determined or controlled directly and therefore. are difficult to regulate their impacts on ecosystem health (Garciaetal.. 2001). Non-pointsourcepollutantsaremainlytransportedoverland andthrough the soil by runoff (Dubus et al.. 2000). These pollutants ultimately find their way into groundwater. wetlands. rivers and lakes and. finally. to oceans in the form of sediment and chemical loads carried by rivers (Albanis et al.. 1998; EPA. 2003; Aydın and Köprücü. 2005).

1032207,Mitochondria. oxidative metabolism and cell death in stroke,2010,Neil R Sims and Hakan Muyderman,1802,,1,80-91,Elsevier,Stroke most commonly results from occlusion of a major artery in the brain and typically leads to the death of all cells within the affected tissue. Mitochondria are centrally involved in the development of this tissue injury due to modifications of their major role in supplying ATP and to changes in their properties that can contribute to the development of apoptotic and necrotic cell death. In animal models of stroke. the limited availability of glucose and oxygen directly impairs oxidative metabolism in severely ischemic regions of the affected tissue and leads to rapid changes in ATP and other energy-related metabolites. In the less-severely ischemic “penumbral” tissue. more moderate alterations develop in these metabolites. associated with near normal glucose use but impaired oxidative metabolism.

Glu can induce an increase in astroglial cell volume with a resulting decrease of the extracellular space. and thereby alter the concentration of extracellular substances. Many lines of evidence show that K+ can be buffered within the astroglial gap-junction-coupled network. and recent results show that gap junctions are permeable for Glu. All these events occur dynamically: the astroglial network has the capacity to interfere actively with neurotransmission. thereby contributing to a high signal-to-noise ratio for the Glu transmission. High-quality neuronal messages during normal physiology can then be maintained.

Conventional optical tweezers have proven useful for manipulating microscale objects but cannot exert enough force to manipulate dielectric materials smaller than about 100 nm. Recently. several near-field optical trapping techniques have been developed that can provide higher trapping stiffness. but they tend to be limited in their ability to reversibly trap and release smaller materials due to a combination of the extremely high electromagnetic fields and the resulting local temperature rise. Here. we have developed a new form of photonic crystal “nanotweezer” that can trap and release on-command Wilson disease proteins. quantum dots. and 22 nm polymer particles with a temperature rise less than ∼0.3 K. which is below the point where unwanted fluid mechanical effects will prevent trapping or …,True,HoBSxUQAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,164,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl204561r,322643103015019987,/scholar?cites=322643103015019987,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3461583/,0,0,0

Such organization protects bacteria from the environment and gives rise to multidrug resistance. We report a kinetic model that accurately describes the permeation properties of this system. The model predicts complex non-linear patterns of drug uptake complete with a bifurcation. which recapitulate the known experimental anomalies. We introduce two kinetic parameters. the efflux and barrier constants. which replace those of Michaelis and Menten for trans-envelope transport. Both compound permeation and efflux display transitions. which delineate regimes of efficient and inefficient efflux. The first transition is related to saturation of the transporter by the compound and the second one behaves as a bifurcation and involves saturation of the outer membrane barrier. The bifurcation was experimentally observed in live bacteria. We further found that active efflux of a drug can be orders of magnitude faster than its diffusion into a cell and that the efficacy of a drug depends both on its transport properties and therapeutic potency. This analysis reveals novel physical principles in the behavior of the cellular envelope. creates a framework for quantification of small molecule permeation into bacteria. and should invigorate structure-activity studies of novel antibiotics.,True,HoBSxUQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,34,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184671,11089451254647010140,/scholar?cites=11089451254647010140,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184671,0,0,0

Rubisco,2011,Spencer M Whitney and Robert L Houtz and Hernan Alonso,155,Plant physiology,1,27-35,American Society of Plant Biologists,There is a growing impetus in developing novel strategies to address global concerns regarding food security. As crop productivity gains through traditional breeding begin to lag and arable land becomes scarcer. it seems that we are heading for unsustainable global populations. It has been foreshadowed that global food production will need to rise more than 50% before 2050 to meet the ever-increasing demand. Compounding the problem are the uncertainties of climate change and its impact on agriculture. Strategies to improve crop yield potential have begun to examine aspects of supercharging photosynthesis to drive a new “green revolution.” Central to many of these strategies is addressing the limitation of nature’s CO2-fixing enzyme.

However. some characteristics of Rubisco make it surprisingly inefficient and compromise photosynthetic productivity. For example. Rubisco catalyses a wasteful reaction with oxygen that leads to the release of previously fixed CO2 and NH3 and the consumption of energy during photorespiration. Furthermore. Rubisco is slow and large amounts are needed to support adequate photosynthetic rates. Consequently. Rubisco has been studied intensively as a prime target for manipulations to ‘supercharge’ photosynthesis and improve both productivity and resource use efficiency.

Biotic and abiotic Oxidative stresses can also artificially induce senescence and increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) specifically in chloroplast. One of the important oxidative stresses is paraquat that induces deviation of electron from photosynthesis electron chain and lead to the production of more ROS in chloroplast. Plants have evolved special adoptive mechanism to reallocate nutrient to reproductive and juvenile organs in senescence and different oxidative stresses. Rubisco seems to be the most abundant protein in plants and is involved in many changes during senescence. In the present study. the effects of ROS on Rubisco during senescence and oxidative stresses were evaluated by measuring photosynthesis factors such as net photosynthesis rate (Pn). stomatal conductance (G). evaporation rate (E). intra cellular CO2 concentration (Ci). fluorescence and total protein during three stages of development. Our results showed that in paraquat treated plants. CO2 assimilation is the most effective factor that refers to Rubisco damages. The highest correlation and regression coefficient belonged to Ci. while correlation coefficient between photosynthesis rate and total protein was much smaller.

Neither a cure nor effective long-term therapy exist and the lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms responsible for PD development is a major impediment to therapeutic advances. The protein αSynuclein is a central component in PD pathogenesis yet its cellular targets and mechanism of toxicity remains unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also a common theme in PD patients and this review explores the strong possibility that αSynuclein and mitochondrial dysfunction have an inter-relationship responsible for underlying the disease pathology. Amplifying cycles of mitochondrial dysfunction and αSynuclein toxicity can be envisaged. with either being the disease-initiating factor yet acting together during disease progression. Multiple potential mechanisms exist in which mitochondrial dysfunction and αSynuclein could interact to exacerbate their neurodegenerative properties.

Using RNP granules as an example. we provide evidence for an assembly mechanism of large cellular structures wherein specific protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions act together with promiscuous interactions of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). This synergistic assembly mechanism illuminates RNP granule assembly and explains why many components of RNP granules. and other large dynamic assemblies. contain IDRs linked to specific protein-protein or protein-RNA interaction modules. We suggest assemblies based on combinations of specific interactions and promiscuous IDRs are common features of eukaryotic cells.,True,0dONQi0AAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC,0,https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/v692t6791,,,,,0,0,0

Their ability to release antimicrobial peptides. such as cathelicidin. protects against bacterial infections when the epithelial barrier is breached. We recently described that MCs defend against bacterial and viral infections through the release of cathelicidin during degranulation. In this study. we hypothesize that cathelicidin expression is induced in MCs by the activation of TLR2 from bacterial products (lipoteichoic acid) produced by commensal bacteria at the epithelial surface. Our research shows that signaling through TLR2 increases the production and expression of cathelicidin in mast cells. thereby enhancing their capacity to fight vaccinia virus. MCs deficient in cathelicidin were less efficient in killing vaccinia virus after lipoteichoic acid stimulation than wild-type cells. Moreover. the activation of TLR2 increases the MC recruitment at the skin …,True,qPbHiI4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,63,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/189/4/1551.short,4246009699967495030,/scholar?cites=4246009699967495030,,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/189/4/1551.full.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. it is shown that Bcl-3 is inducible by the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and is overexpressed in lesional skin of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. Bcl-3 was shown to be important to cutaneous innate immune responses as silencing of Bcl-3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the downregulatory effect of IL-4 on the HBD3 expression. Bcl-3 silencing enhanced vitamin D3 (1.25D3)-induced gene expression of cathelicidin AMP in keratinocytes. suggesting a negative regulatory function on cathelicidin transcription.

During the past 15 years. particularly aggressive strains transmitted among CF patients have been identified. initially in Europe and more recently in Canada. The aim of this study was to generate high-quality genome sequences for 7 isolates of the Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) from the United Kingdom and Canada representing different virulence characteristics in order to: (1) associate comparative genomics results with virulence factor variability and (2) identify genomic and/or phenotypic divergence between the two geographical locations. We performed phenotypic characterization of pyoverdine. pyocyanin. motility. biofilm formation. and proteolytic activity. We also assessed the degree of virulence using the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model. Comparative genomics analysis revealed at least one large deletion (40–50 kb) in 6 out of the 7 isolates compared to the reference genome of LESB58. These deletions correspond to prophages. which are known to increase the competitiveness of LESB58 in chronic lung infection. We also identified 308 non-synonymous polymorphisms. of which 28 were associated with virulence determinants and 52 with regulatory proteins. At the phenotypic level. isolates showed extensive variability in production of pyocyanin. pyoverdine. proteases and biofilm as well as in swimming motility. while being predominantly avirulent in the amoeba model. Isolates from the two continents were phylogenetically and phenotypically undistinguishable.

S25800,SAGE Publications,Small colony variant (SCV) bacteria arise spontaneously within apparently homogeneous microbial populations. largely in response to environmental stresses. such as antimicrobial treatment. They display unique phenotypic characteristics conferred in part by heritable genetic changes. Characteristically slow growing. SCVs comprise a minor proportion of the population from which they arise but persist by virtue of their inherent resilience and host adaptability. Consequently. SCVs are problematic in chronic infection. where antimicrobial treatment is administered during the acute phase of infection but fails to eradicate SCVs. which remain within the host causing recurrent or chronic infection.

Species-specific identification. which is relevant for the complex of different toxins production. by traditional methods of microscopy is difficult due to the high morphological variability. and thus different morphotypes can be easily misinterpreted.

Loss of this isoform results in relaxed chromatin structure. rapid cell-cycle checkpoint …,True,xMlT-40AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,217,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12147,1012953559929952920,/scholar?cites=1012953559929952920,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3683358/,0,0,0

These consist of the well-characterized ATR (Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad-3 related)/CHK1 and ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated)/CHK2 pathways in addition to a newly identified ATM/ATR/p38MAPK/MK2 checkpoint. Crucial to maintaining the integrity of the genome is the S-phase checkpoint that functions to prevent DNA replication until damaged DNA is repaired. Inappropriate expression of the proto-oncogene c-Myc is known to cause DNA damage. One mechanism by which c-Myc induces DNA damage is through binding directly to components of the prereplicative complex thereby promoting DNA synthesis. resulting in replication-associated DNA damage and checkpoint activation due to inappropriate origin firing. Here we show that following etoposide-induced DNA damage translation of c-Myc is …,True,xMlT-40AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,185,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/12/5375.short,18335690104948335622,/scholar?cites=18335690104948335622,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/107/12/5375.full.pdf,0,0,0

However. eukaryotic cells have evolved complex mechanisms of genomic surveillance and DNA damage repair to counteract the effects of UVB radiation. We show that following UVB DNA damage. there is an overall inhibition of protein synthesis and translational reprogramming. This reprogramming allows selective synthesis of DDR proteins. such as ERCC1. ERCC5. DDB1. XPA. XPD. and OGG1 and relies on upstream ORFs in the 5′ untranslated region of these mRNAs.

Cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage requires downregulation of Myc via a p53-independent signaling pathway. Here we have used siRNA screening of the human kinome to identify MAPKAPK5 (MK5. PRAK) as a negative regulator of Myc expression. MK5 regulates translation of Myc. since it is required for expression of miR-34b and miR-34c that bind to the 3′UTR of MYC. MK5 activates miR-34b/c expression via phosphorylation of FoxO3a. thereby promoting nuclear localization of FoxO3a and enabling it to induce miR-34b/c expression and arrest proliferation.

In a cancer cachexia model we have shown that protein depletion in the skeletal muscle. which is a prominent feature of the syndrome. is mostly due to enhanced proteolysis. There is consensus on the views that the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway plays an important role in such metabolic response and that cytotoxic cytokines such as TNFα are involved in its triggering (Costelli and Baccino. 2000). yet the mechanisms by which the relevant extracellular signals are transduced into protein hypercatabolism are largely unknown.

We now report that a calpain-calpastatin association can occur also in the absence of Ca2+ or at very low Ca2+ concentrations. reflecting the physiological conditions under which calpain retains its inactive conformational state. The calpastatin binding region is localized in the non-inhibitory L-domain containing the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 4-7. This calpastatin region recognizes a calpain sequence located near the end of the DII-domain.

Extremely reactive to amino acid side chains. these oxidants cause widespread protein unfolding and aggregation. It is therefore not surprising that cells draw on a variety of different strategies to counteract the damage and maintain a healthy proteome. Orchestrated largely by direct changes in the thiol oxidation status of key proteins. the response strategies involve all layers of protein protection.

We have biochemically purified and identified SCAPER. a novel protein that specifically interacts with cyclin A/Cdk2 in vivo. Its expression is cell cycle independent. and it associates with cyclin A/Cdk2 at multiple phases of the cell cycle. SCAPER localizes primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum. Ectopic expression of SCAPER sequesters cyclin A from the nucleus and results specifically in an accumulation of cells in M phase of the cell cycle. RNAi-mediated depletion of SCAPER decreases the cytoplasmic pool of cyclin A and delays the G1/S phase transition upon cell cycle re-entry from quiescence.

This article outlines the general nature of the DNA replication machinery. but also points out important and key differences. The most complex organisms. eukaryotes. have to coordinate the initiation of DNA replication from many origins in each genome and impose regulation that maintains genomic integrity. not only for the sake of each cell. but for the organism as a whole. In addition. DNA replication in eukaryotes needs to be coordinated with inheritance of chromatin. developmental patterning of tissues. and cell division to ensure that the genome replicates once per cell division cycle.,True,6WODoEoAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,252,https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/5/7/a010108.short,4287163914541515588,/scholar?cites=4287163914541515588,,https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/5/7/a010108.full.pdf,0,0,0

We reconstituted Saccharomyces cerevisiae replication forks and found that CMG helicase selects polymerase (Pol) ɛ to the exclusion of Pol δ on the leading strand. Even if Pol δ assembles on the leading strand. Pol ɛ rapidly replaces it. Pol δ–PCNA is distributive with CMG. in contrast to its high stability on primed ssDNA. Hence CMG will not stabilize Pol δ. instead leaving the leading strand accessible for Pol ɛ and stabilizing Pol ɛ. Comparison of Pol ɛ and Pol δ on a lagging-strand model DNA reveals the opposite. Pol δ dominates over excess Pol ɛ on PCNA-primed ssDNA. Thus. PCNA strongly favors Pol δ over Pol ɛ on the lagging strand. but CMG over-rides and flips this balance in favor of Pol ɛ on the leading strand.,True,6WODoEoAAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC,152,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.2851,8323791194250660587,/scholar?cites=8323791194250660587,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4482249/,0,0,0

We find that Escherichia coli translesion DNA polymerase II (Pol II) and polymerase IV (Pol IV) function with DnaB helicase and regulate its rate of unwinding. slowing it to as little as 1 bp/s. Furthermore. Pol II and Pol IV freely exchange with the polymerase III (Pol III) replicase on the β-clamp and function with DnaB helicase to form alternative replisomes. even before Pol III stalls at a lesion. DNA damage-induced levels of Pol II and Pol IV dominate the clamp. slowing the helicase and stably maintaining the architecture of the replication machinery while keeping the fork moving. We propose that these dynamic actions provide additional time for normal excision repair of lesions before the replication fork reaches them and also enable the appropriate translesion polymerase to sample each lesion as it is encountered.,True,6WODoEoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,109,https://www.pnas.org/content/106/15/6031.short,3232698850704130539,/scholar?cites=3232698850704130539,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/15/6031.full.pdf,0,0,0

This study identifies a process unprecedented in bacterial replisomes. While bacteria and phage simply recruit polymerases to the fork. we find that suppression mechanisms are used to position the distinct eukaryotic polymerases on their respective strands. Hence. Pol ε is active with CMG on the leading strand. but it is unable to function on the lagging strand. even when Pol δ is not present. Conversely. Pol δ-PCNA is the only enzyme capable of extending Okazaki fragments in the presence of Pols ε and α. We have shown earlier that Pol δ-PCNA is suppressed on the leading strand with CMG . We propose that CMG. the 11-subunit helicase. is responsible for one or both of these suppression mechanisms that spatially control polymerase occupancy at the fork.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04988.001,True,6WODoEoAAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C,104,https://elifesciences.org/articles/04988,2489494133696501327,/scholar?cites=2489494133696501327,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/04988,0,0,0

Discovery that replisomes repeatedly discard sliding clamps and assemble a new clamp to start each Okazaki fragment provided the first hint that the replisome structure changes during replication. Recent studies reveal that the replisome is more dynamic than ever thought possible. Replisomes can utilize many different polymerases; the helicase is regulated to travel at widely different speeds; leading and lagging strands need not always act in a coupled fashion with DNA loops; and the replication fork does not always exhibit semi-discontinuous replication. We review some of these findings here and discuss their implications for cell physiology as well as enzyme mechanism.,True,6WODoEoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,76,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/cc.8.17.9390,16570706116220906964,/scholar?cites=16570706116220906964,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/cc.8.17.9390,0,0,0

Glucagon also plays a role in limiting hepatic glucose uptake and producing the hyperglycaemic phenotype associated with insulin deficiency and insulin resistance. In response to a physiological rise in glucagon. HGP is rapidly stimulated. This increase in HGP is entirely attributable to an enhancement of glycogenolysis. with little to no acute effect on gluconeogenesis. This dramatic rise in glycogenolysis in response to hyperglucagonemia wanes with time. A component of this waning effect is known to be independent of hyperglycemia. though the molecular basis for this tachyphylaxis is not fully understood.

1032441,The interaction properties of the human Rab GTPase family–A comparative analysis reveals determinants of molecular binding selectivity,2012,Matthias Stein and Manohar Pilli and Sabine Bernauer and Bianca H Habermann and Marino Zerial and Rebecca C Wade,7,PloS one,4,e34870,Public Library of Science,Background Rab GTPases constitute the largest subfamily of the Ras protein superfamily. Rab proteins regulate organelle biogenesis and transport. and display distinct binding preferences for effector and activator proteins. many of which have not been elucidated yet. The underlying molecular recognition motifs. binding partner preferences and selectivities are not well understood.   Methodology/Principal Findings Comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional electrostatic and hydrophobic molecular interaction fields of 62 human Rab proteins revealed a wide range of binding properties with large differences between some Rab proteins. This analysis assists the functional annotation of Rab proteins 12. 14. 26. 37 and 41 and provided an explanation for the shared function of Rab3 and 27. Rab7a and 7b have very different electrostatic potentials. indicating that they may bind to different effector proteins and thus. exert different functions. The subfamily V Rab GTPases which are associated with endosome differ subtly in the interaction properties of their switch regions. and this may explain exchange factor specificity and exchange kinetics.   Conclusions/Significance We have analysed conservation of sequence and of molecular interaction fields to cluster and annotate the human Rab proteins. The analysis of three dimensional molecular interaction fields provides detailed insight that is not available from a sequence-based approach alone. Based on our results. we predict novel functions for some Rab proteins and provide insights into their divergent functions and the determinants of their binding partner selectivity.,True,IfMiCHYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,41,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034870,6255357287596977188,/scholar?cites=6255357287596977188,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034870,0,0,0

Whereas in HTS. lysine (0.166%) was the first and methionine (0.176%) was the second limiting amino acid. Methionine contents in LTS. MTS. and HTS were 0.114%. 0.182%. and 0.176%. respectively. Although crude protein was lower in HTS (10%) than the other SG. histidine. methionine. and isoleucine were higher for HTS as compared to LTS and MTS. TAAA decreased when tannin content increased and all amino acids had a lower availability in HTS than in LTS and MTS (p< 0.05). Methionine in HTS and LTS had the highest availability as had glutamic acid in MTS. The availability of proline was most affected by tannin. which was 91.55% for LTS. 84.82% for MTS. and 22.82% for HTS (p< 0.05).,True,LZ9q1yYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,59,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.483.6771&rep=rep1&type=pdf,15999470782800663964,/scholar?cites=15999470782800663964,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.483.6771&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Treatments were included soybean oil at 0. 2.5. 5 and 7.5% levels and crude protein levels were NRC (1994) recommendation and 10 percent more than NRC recommendation (NRC× 1.10). Each treatment replicated four times. Inclusion of soybean oil in diet had no significant effect on feed intake in chicks in NRC protein level. Feeding high protein diet resulted to more feed intake than NRC. Increasing diet protein up to 10% more than NRC recommendation could not improve body weight gain in broiler chickens except for 7-21d old chicks that fed a diet containing no soybean oil and high protein level that resulted to highest weight gain. In 7-21 d old chicks feeding a diet with 2.5% soybean oil and a protein level 10% more than NRC recommendation resulted to lowest feed conversion ratio.

The host protease furin cleaves the full-length precursor S glycoprotein into two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2. Cleavage of S generates a polybasic Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg carboxyl-terminal sequence on S1. which conforms to a C-end rule (CendR) motif that binds to cell surface neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2 receptors. We used x-ray crystallography and biochemical approaches to show that the S1 CendR motif directly bound NRP1. Blocking this interaction by RNA interference or selective inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and infectivity in cell culture.

To enter a new host cell. the majority of viruses take advantage of the endocytic mechanisms of the cell and wait until reaching endocytic vacuoles or other cytoplasmic compartments before penetrating into the cytosol. After penetration. viruses and viral capsids exploit the cytoplasmic transport systems of the cell. moving to sites of replication within the cytosol (most RNA viruses) or the nucleus (most DNA viruses). The final step in the entry process generally involves uncoating of the viral genome. After numerous entry studies with a variety of viruses in different cell systems. the overall picture of entry of animal virus into the host cell is becoming increasingly complete. There are essentially six locations for penetration.

Using siRNA silencing. we found that histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8). a cytoplasmic enzyme. efficiently promoted productive entry of IAV into tissue culture cells. whereas HDAC1 suppressed it. HDAC8 enhanced endocytosis. acidification. and penetration of the incoming virus. In contrast. HDAC1 inhibited acidification and penetration. The effects were connected with dramatic alterations in the organization of the microtubule system. and. as a consequence. a change in the behavior of LEs and lysosomes (LYs). Depletion of HDAC8 caused loss of centrosome-associated microtubules and loss of directed centripetal movement of LEs. dispersing LE/LYs to the cell periphery. For HDAC1. the picture was the opposite. To explain these changes. centrosome cohesion emerged as the critical factor. Depletion of HDAC8 caused centrosome splitting. which could also be induced by depleting a centriole-linker protein. rootletin. In both cases. IAV infection was inhibited. HDAC1 depletion reduced the splitting of centrosomes. and enhanced infection. The longer the distance between centrosomes. the lower the level of infection. HDAC8 depletion was also found to inhibit infection of Uukuniemi virus (a bunyavirus) suggesting common requirements among late penetrating enveloped viruses.

An isoform of AE1 is also present in the kidney. Specific mutations in human AE1 cause several types of hereditary hemolytic anemias and/or distal renal tubular acidosis. Here we report the crystal structure of the band 3 anion exchanger domain (AE1CTD) at 3.5 angstroms. The structure is locked in an outward-facing open conformation by an inhibitor. Comparing this structure with a substrate-bound structure of the uracil transporter UraA in an inward-facing conformation allowed us to identify the anion-binding position in the AE1CTD. and to propose a possible transport mechanism that could explain why selected mutations lead to disease.,True,rEQLIrcAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,142,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6261/680.abstract,14044032649746799302,/scholar?cites=14044032649746799302,,,0,0,0

Here we focused on mDia2. an mDia isoform involved in cytokinesis of NIH 3T3 cells. and analyzed mechanisms of its localization in cytokinesis. We found that targeting of mDia2 to the cleavage furrow requires not only its binding to RhoA but also its diaphanous-inhibitory domain (DID).

Complex traits such as crop yield are likely multigenic. and the exhaustive screening of random gene combinations to achieve yield gains is not realistic. Clearly. smart approaches must be developed. In silico analyses of plant metabolism and gene networks can move a trait discovery program beyond trial-and-error approaches and towards rational design strategies. Metabolic models employing flux-balance analysis are useful to determine the contribution of individual genes to a trait. or to compare. optimize. or even design metabolic pathways.

Distinct classes of enzymes generate different forms of inositol pyrophosphates. The biosynthesis of these substances principally involves phosphorylation of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) to generate the pyrophosphate IP7.

1032640,U2AF binding selects for the high conservation of the C. elegans 3′ splice site,2005,Courtney Hollins and Diego AR Zorio and Margaret MacMorris and Thomas Blumenthal,11,Rna,3,248-253,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,Caenorhabditis elegans is unusual among animals in having a highly conserved octamer sequence at the 3′ splice site: UUUU CAG/R. This sequence can bind to the essential heterodimeric splicing factor U2AF. with U2AF65 contacting the U tract and U2AF35 contacting the splice site itself (AG/R). Here we demonstrate a strong correspondence between binding to U2AF of RNA oligonucleotides with variant octamer sequences and the frequency with which such variations occur in splice sites. C. elegans U2AF has a strong preference for the octamer sequence and exerts much of the pressure for 3′ splice sites to have the precise UUUUCAG/R sequence. At two positions the splice site has a very strong preference for U even though alternative bases can also bind tightly to U2AF. suggesting that evolution can select against sequences that may have a relatively modest reduction in binding.

U2AF. is an essential splicing factor required for recognition of the polypyrimidine tract and subsequent U2 snRNP assembly at the branch point. Because Caenorhabditis elegans introns lack both polypyrimidine tract and branch point consensus sequences but have a very highly conserved UUUUCAG/R consensus at their 39 splice sites. we hypothesized that U2AF might serve to recognize this sequence and thus promote intron recognition in C. elegans. Here we report the cloning of the gene for the large subunit of U2AF. uaf-1. Three classes of cDNA were identified.

The subsequence -hydrophobic residue-1-hydrophobic residue- is required for folding in the context of a nucleated two-stranded parallel β-sheet structure.

Ltd.,The effect of soybean flour on gluten‐free bread quality was studied. Full‐fat enzyme‐active. semiactive and inactive soybean flours were evaluated. Active soybean flour improved the volume and structure of gluten‐free bread. while semiactive and inactive soybean flours did not have positive effects on bread quality. The particle size and concentration of the soybean flours also affected bread quality. Levels of addition between 125 and 150 g kg−1 and particle sizes between 90 and 120 µm of active soybean flour yielded the best results. Heating the active soybean flour destroyed its improving effect. The analysis of proteins by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography showed that heating soybean flour at 60–200°C caused protein aggregation.

Dough rheology and bread quality were affected in different ways by the addition of hydrocolloids. Pectin and λ-carrageenan strengthened wheat dough and sodium alginate augmented the extensibility of dough. In addition. sodium alginate and pectin improve loaf volume and all the hydrocolloids tested decreased the initial bread crumb firmness and chewiness.

Following a method developed previously. the resultant light scattering and spectroscopic data were synthesized into an empirical phase diagram that visually and simultaneously represents the entire data set. Using this empirically-based phase diagram. screening assays were developed to identify potential vaccine stabilizers. Various compounds are shown by these assays to inhibit the temperature-induced aggregation of viral particles. and also to protect the integrity of the viral envelope. Accelerated stability assays show that. upon thermal challenge. MV formulated with these excipients retains its infectivity to a significant extent.

Although secondary metabolites and their secretory structures are commonly assumed to have a defensive function. evidence that they benefit plant fitness under herbivore attack is scarce. especially below ground. Here. we tested whether latex secondary metabolites produced by the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale agg.) decrease the performance of its major native insect root herbivore. the larvae of the common cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha). and benefit plant vegetative and reproductive fitness under M. melolontha attack. Across 17 T. officinale genotypes screened by gas and liquid chromatography. latex concentrations of the sesquiterpene lactone taraxinic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G) were negatively associated with M. melolontha larval growth. Adding purified TA-G to artificial diet at ecologically relevant concentrations reduced larval feeding. Silencing the germacrene A synthase ToGAS1. an enzyme that was identified to catalyze the first committed step of TA-G biosynthesis. resulted in a 90% reduction of TA-G levels and a pronounced increase in M. melolontha feeding. Transgenic. TA-G-deficient lines were preferred by M. melolontha and suffered three times more root biomass reduction than control lines.

For example. the bark beetle Ips typographus and its associated blue-staining fungus. Ceratocystis polonica. frequently kill mature Norway spruce (Picea abies). the most abundant conifer in the boreal and temperate forests of Eurasia. The risk of fatal attack from I. typographus and other bark beetles is expected to increase due to stress-induced tree susceptibility.[1. 2] However. it has been shown that certain Norway spruce genotypes are more resistant to bark beetles or their fungal associates than others.[3] Norway spruce synthesizes an array of chemical defense compounds [4] that have been intensively studied to identify the causes of effective resistance.[5. 6] The best-studied defensive chemicals in spruce are the components of oleoresin (reviewed in ref.[6]). This viscous mixture of mono-. sesqui-. and diterpenoids is stored in specialized ducts lined with terpenoid-producing epithelial cells. Upon actual or simulated attack by herbivores or pathogens. terpenoids accumulate. and the oleoresin mixture changes in composition.[7. 8] De-novo-synthesized oleoresin can contribute significantly towards a tree’s resistance to bark beetle attack.[9–11] However. Norway spruce also produces very diverse polyphenolics. including phenylpropanoids. stilbenes. and flavonoids. Yet the defensive role of polyphenols has been less investigated than that of oleoresin. even though the former are almost as abundant as terpenoids in spruce tissues.

Cerebral edema resulting from AQP4 over expression is considered to be one of the major determinants for progressive neuronal insult during cerebral ischemia. Although. both upregulation and downregulation of AQP4 expression is associated with brain pathology. over expression of AQP4 is one of the chief contributors of water imbalance in brain during ischemic pathology. We have found that Piroxicam binds to AQP4 with optimal binding energy value. Thus. we hypothesized that Piroxicam is neuroprotective in the rodent cerebral ischemic model by mitigating cerebral edema via AQP4 regulation.  Methods Rats were treated with Piroxicam OR placebo at 30 min prior. 2 h post and 4 h post 60 minutes of MCAO followed by 24 hour reperfusion.

Cu. Ag. or Al (50–60 nm. 50 mg/kg. i.p. daily for 1 week) alter blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and induce brain pathology in adult rats (age 18 to 22 weeks). However. effects of size-dependent neurotoxicity of NPs in vivo are still largely unknown. In present investigation. we examined the effects of different size ranges of the above-engineered NPs on brain pathology in rats. Furthermore. the fact that age is also an important factor in brain pathology was also investigated in our rat model. Our results showed that small-sized NPs induced the most pronounced BBB breakdown (EBA +480 to 680 %; radioiodine +850 to 1025 %). brain edema formation (+4 to 6 %) and neuronal injuries (+30 to 40 %). glial fibrillary acidic protein upregulation (+40 to 56 % increase). and myelin vesiculation (+30 to 35 % damage …,True,89_XQ-QAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,58,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-013-8500-0,14465339051233104534,/scholar?cites=14465339051233104534,,,0,0,0

An increased availability of the drug for longer periods to the brain or spinal cord and/or a decrease in the drug metabolism altogether could lead to potentiation of the pharmacological activity of the nano-delivered compounds.

The intracellular calcium overload resulting from glutamate excitotoxicity is considered a major determinant for neuronal loss during cerebral ischemia. Moreover. ASIC1a activation due to acidosis also promotes intracellular calcium overload during ischemic insult. Interestingly. ASIC1a was found to be inhibited by some flavonoids which carry an anti-inflammatory property particularly quercetin. which could be exploited in hypoxic conditions like cerebral ischemia. This encourages us to investigate the neuroprotective effect of quercetin besides its possible downstream signaling mechanism in focal cerebral ischemia.

However. the neurochemical basis of edema formation in CHI is still obscure. Previous studies from our laboratory show that blockade of serotonin synthesis prior to CHI in a rat model attenuates brain edema. indicating a prominent role for serotonin in head injury. Thus. neutralization of endogenous serotonin activity and/or blocking of its receptors will induce neuroprotection in CHI. Since serotonin has more than 14 receptors and selective serotonin antagonists are still not available. we used serotonin antiserum to neutralize its in vivo effects before or after CHI in a rat model.

Membrane bending by proteins is necessary for the generation of intracellular transport carriers and for the maintenance of otherwise intrinsically unstable regions of high membrane curvature in cell organelles. Understanding the mechanisms by which proteins curve membranes is therefore of primary importance. Here we suggest. for the first time to our knowledge. a quantitative mechanism of lipid membrane bending by hydrophobic or amphipathic rodlike inclusions which simulate amphipathic α-helices—structures shown to sculpt membranes. Considering the lipid monolayer matrix as an anisotropic elastic material. we compute the intramembrane stresses and strains generated by the embedded inclusions. determine the resulting membrane shapes. and the accumulated elastic energy.

Env interactions with cellular receptors trigger refolding of gp41. which induces close apposition of viral and cellular membranes leading to membrane fusion. The energy released during refolding is used to overcome the kinetic barrier and drives the fusion reaction. Here. we report the crystal structure at 2 Å resolution of the complete extracellular domain of gp41 lacking the fusion peptide and the cystein-linked loop. Both the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR) and the membrane proximal external region (MPER) form helical extensions from the gp41 six-helical bundle core structure. The lack of regular coiled-coil interactions within FPPR and MPER splay this end of the structure apart while positioning the fusion peptide towards the outside of the six-helical bundle and exposing conserved hydrophobic MPER residues. Unexpectedly. the section of the MPER. which is juxtaposed to the transmembrane region (TMR). bends in a 90°-angle sideward positioning three aromatic side chains per monomer for membrane insertion. We calculate that this structural motif might facilitate the generation of membrane curvature on the viral membrane. The presence of FPPR and MPER increases the melting temperature of gp41 significantly in comparison to the core structure of gp41. Thus. our data indicate that the ordered assembly of FPPR and MPER beyond the core contributes energy to the membrane fusion reaction.

PKD. at the TGN. promotes the production of phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate (PI4P) by activating the lipid kinase phophatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIß (PI4KIIIß). PI4P recruits proteins such as oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP) and ceramide transport protein (CERT) that control sphingolipid and sterol levels at the TGN. CERT mediated transport of ceramide to the TGN. we suggest. is used for increasing the local production and concentration of DAG. Once the crucial concentration of DAG is achieved. OSBP and CERT dissociate from the TGN on phosphorylation by PKD and DAG is sequentially converted into phosphatidic acid (PA) and lyso-PA (LPA).

1032749,Model for curvature-driven pearling instability in membranes,2007,Fèlix Campelo and Aurora Hernández-Machado,99,Physical review letters,8,088101,American Physical Society,A phase-field model for dealing with dynamic instabilities in membranes is presented. We use it to study curvature-driven pearling instability in vesicles induced by the anchorage of amphiphilic polymers on the membrane. Within this model. we obtain the morphological changes reported in recent experiments. The formation of a homogeneous pearled structure is achieved by consequent pearling of an initial cylindrical tube from the tip. For high enough concentration of anchors. we show theoretically that the homogeneous pearled shape is energetically less favorable than an inhomogeneous one. with a large sphere connected to an array of smaller spheres.,True,ygbUkhkAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,78,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.088101,15310640606247021218,/scholar?cites=15310640606247021218,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.2573,0,0,0

The observed membrane shaping can be simple deformations of existing shapes or membrane remodeling involving fission or fusion. Here we describe several mechanistic principles by which membrane shaping proteins act. We especially consider models for membrane bending and fission by EHD2 proteins and membrane bending by N-BAR domains.

Our data reveal that a TANGO1 ring is organized by its radial interaction with COPII. and lateral interactions with cTAGE5. TANGO1-short or itself. Of particular interest is the finding that TANGO1 recruits ERGIC membranes for collagen export via the NRZ (NBAS/RINT1/ZW10) tether complex. Therefore.

The presence of this enzyme in pathogenic gram-positive bacteria prevents the successful use of gentamicin C and most other aminoglycosides as therapeutic agents.In an effort to understand the mechanism of aminoglycoside modification. we expressed AAC(6′)-APH(2″) in Bacillus subtilis. The purified enzyme is monomeric with a molecular mass of 57 kDa and displays both the expected aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferase and O-phosphotransferase activities. Structure-function analysis with various aminoglycosides substrates reveals an enzyme with broad specificity in both enzymatic activities. accounting for AAC(6′)-APH(2″)'s dramatic negative impact on clinical aminoglycoside therapy.

O-adenylation or N-acetylation. Aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APHs) catalyze the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of these antibiotics. Two particular enzymes in this class. APH(3′)-IIIa and AAC(6′)-APH(2″). are produced in gram-positive cocci and have been shown to phosphorylate aminoglycosides on their 3′ and 2″ hydroxyl groups. respectively. The three-dimensional structure of APH (3′)-IIIa is strikingly similar to those of eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs). and the observation. reported previously. that APH(3′)-llla and AAC(6′)-APH(2″) are effectively inhibited by EPK inhibitors suggested the possibility that these aminoglycoside kinases might phosphorylate EPK substrates.Our data demonstrate …,True,Di7mGiIAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,99,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552199800167,9963377900627578732,/scholar?cites=9963377900627578732,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552199800167/pdf?md5=be964f568a63530d689e3cbae511e4ff&pid=1-s2.0-S1074552199800167-main.pdf&_valck=1,0,0,0

F.. et al. (1998) Nat. Biotechnol. 16. 851]. Proteins of the YjeQ family contain all sequence motifs typical of the vast class of P-loop-containing GTPases. but show a circular permutation. with a G4−G1−G3 pattern of motifs as opposed to the regular G1−G3−G4 pattern seen in most GTPases. All YjeQ family proteins display a unique domain architecture. which includes a predicted N-terminal OB-fold RNA-binding domain. the central permuted GTPase module. and a zinc knuckle-like C-terminal cysteine cluster. This domain architecture suggests a possible role for YjeQ as a regulator of translation. YjeQ was overexpressed. purified to homogeneity. and shown to contain 0.6 equiv of GDP.

We report here the first use of multicopy suppression as a forward genetic method to determine cellular targets and potential resistance mechanisms for novel antibacterial compounds identified through high-throughput screening. A screen of 8640 small molecules for growth inhibition of a hyperpermeable strain of Escherichia coli led to the identification of 49 leads for suppressor selection from clones harboring an E. coli genomic library. The majority of suppressors were found to encode the multidrug efflux pump AcrB. indicating that those compounds were substrates for efflux.

We created a yloQ deletion strain. which exhibited a slow growth phenotype and formed chains of filamentous cells. Additionally. we constructed a conditional mutant in yloQ. where growth was dependent on inducible expression from a complementing copy of the gene. In phenotypic studies. depletion of yloQ sensitized cells to antibiotics that bind at the peptide channel or peptidyl transferase centre. providing the first chemical genetic evidence linking this GTPase to ribosome function.
