1279116,Imaging vector fields using line integral convolution,1993,Brian Cabral and Leith Casey Leedom,,,,263-270,,Imaging vector fields has applications in science. art. image processing and special effects. An effective new approach is to use linear and curvilinear filtering techniques to locally blur textures along a vector field. This approach builds on several previous texture generation and filtering techniques [8. 9. 11. 14. 15. 17. 23]. It is. however. unique because it is local. one-dimensional and independent of any predefined geometry or texture. The technique is general and capable of imaging arbitrary two-and three-dimensional vector fields. The local one-dimensional nature of the algorithm lends itself to highly parallel and efficient implementations. Furthermore. the curvilinear filter is capable of rendering detail on very intricate vector fields. Combining this technique with other rendering and image processing techniques—like periodic motion filtering—results in richly informative and striking images. The technique can also …,True,pAHgZ2kAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,1860,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/166117.166151,5657881540599787128,/scholar?cites=5657881540599787128,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10185520-hIb0EP/,0,0,0
1279117,Accelerated volume rendering and tomographic reconstruction using texture mapping hardware,1994,Brian Cabral and Nancy Cam and Jim Foran,,,,91-98,,Volume rendering and reconstruction centers around solving two related integral equations: a volume rendering integral (a generalized Radon transform) and a filtered back projection integral (the inverse Radon transform). Both of these equations are of the same mathematical form and can be dimensionally decomposed and approximated using Riemann sums over a series of resampled images. When viewed as a form of texture mapping and frame buffer accumulation. enormous hardware enabled performance acceleration is possible.,True,pAHgZ2kAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,1408,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/197938.197972,4701486551004878629,/scholar?cites=4701486551004878629,,,http://www.employees.org/~drich/SGI/DeveloperForum95/Silicon_Graphics_Developer_Forum_95_The_CD_Volume_2/documents/Accelerated_Volume_Rendering.ps,0,0,0
1279118,Bidirectional reflection functions from surface bump maps,1987,Brian Cabral and Nelson Max and Rebecca Springmeyer,,,,273-281,,The Torrance-Sparrow model for calculating bidirectional reflection functions contains a geometrical attenuation factor to account for shadowing and occlusions in a hypothetical distribution of grooves on a rough surface. Using an efficient table-based method for determining the shadows and occlusions. we calculate the geometric attenuation factor for surfaces defined by a specific table of bump heights. Diffuse and glossy specular reflection of the environment can be handled in a unified manner by using an integral of the bidirectional reflection function times the environmental illumination. over the hemisphere of solid angle above a surface. We present a method of estimating the integral. by expanding the bidirectional reflection coefficient in spherical harmonics. and show how the coefficients in this expansion can be determined efficiently by reorganizing our geometric attenuation calculation.,True,pAHgZ2kAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,343,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/37401.37434,7679085034089574716,/scholar?cites=7679085034089574716,,,http://dumay.info/pdf/Reflectionmapping/4.pdf,0,0,0
1279119,Reflection space image based rendering,1999,Brian Cabral and Marc Olano and Philip Nemec,,,,165-170,,High quality. physically accurate rendering at interactive rates has widespread application. but is a daunting task. We attempt to bridge the gap between high-quality offline and interactive rendering by using existing environment mapping hardware in combination with a novel Image Based Rendering (IBR) algorithm. The primary contribution lies in performing IBR in reflection space. This method can be applied to ordinary environment maps. but for more physically accurate rendering. we apply reflection space IBR to radiance environment maps. A radiance environment map pre-integrates a Bidirectional Reflection Distribution Function (BRDF) with a lighting environment. Using the reflection-space IBR algorithm on radiance environment maps allows interactive rendering of arbitrary objects with a large class of complex BRDFs in arbitrary lighting environments. The ultimate simplicity of the final algorithm suggests …,True,pAHgZ2kAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,200,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/311535.311553,11115549627986487179,/scholar?cites=11115549627986487179,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.440.4999&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This paper proposes generalizations of the ART to describe two-dimensional images and three-dimensional models. First. we propose an 2D extension. called GART. which allows applying ART to images while insuring robustness to all possible rotations and to perspective deformations. Then. we generalize the ART to index 3D models. This new 3D shape descriptor. so called 3D ART. has the same properties that the original transform: robustness to rotation. translation. noise and scaling while keeping a compact size and a good retrieval cost. The size of the descriptor is an essential evaluation parameter on which depends the response time of a content-based retrieval system.

Berlin. Heidelberg,In this paper. we propose a novel approach for action classification in soccer videos using a recurrent neural network scheme. Thereby. we extract from each video action at each timestep a set of features which describe both the visual content (by the mean of a BoW approach) and the dominant motion (with a key point based approach). A Long Short-Term Memory-based Recurrent Neural Network is then trained to classify each video sequence considering the temporal evolution of the features for each timestep. Experimental results on the MICC-Soccer-Actions-4 database show that the proposed approach outperforms classification methods of related works (with a classification rate of 77 %). and that the combination of the two features (BoW and dominant motion) leads to a classification rate of 92 %.,True,JQVn75cAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC,128,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15822-3_20,3881364222241931213,/scholar?cites=3881364222241931213,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.675.8084&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1279421,Segmentation and superquadric modeling of 3D objects,2003,Laurent Chevalier and Fabrice Jaillet and Atilla Baskurt,,,,,UNION Agency–Science Press,A new model for representing an unorganised 3D data points set is proposed. Based on superquadrics. this model allows to describe the points set with a union of superellipsoids. Two different segmentation and modeling methods are developed in order to determine the whole model: a region growing approach and a split and merge one. This second method leads to a low sensitive model compared to the one obtained by the region growing. The model is simple and compact: only 11 parameters are needed per superellipsoid. It seems promising for 3D object compression and 3D object indexing and retrieval. As the topological relations of the superellipsoids are known. the model can be associated to a graph. The graph theory can thus be used in order to compare and to measure the similarity between 3D objects.,True,JQVn75cAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,120,https://otik.uk.zcu.cz/handle/11025/1637,10155246129171529857,/scholar?cites=10155246129171529857,,,https://otik.uk.zcu.cz/bitstream/11025/1637/1/D71.pdf,0,0,0

However the classical way of comparing two Zernike descriptors only takes into account the magnitude of the moments and loses the phase information. The novelty of our approach is to take advantage of the phase information in the comparison process while still preserving the invariance to rotation. This new Zernike comparator provides a more accurate similarity measure together with the optimal rotation angle between the patterns. while keeping the same complexity as the classical approach. This angle information is particularly of interest for many applications. including 3D scene understanding through images. Experiments demonstrate that our comparator outperforms the classical one in terms of similarity measure. In particular the robustness of the retrieval against noise and geometric deformation is …,True,JQVn75cAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,114,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4522555/,11051157110079819946,/scholar?cites=11051157110079819946,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01437606/file/Liris-3433.pdf,0,0,0

The watermarking primitive is an intrinsic 3D shape descriptor: the analytic and continuous geometric volume moment. During watermark embedding. the input mesh is first normalized to a canonical and robust spatial pose by using its global volume moments. Then. the normalized mesh is decomposed into patches and the watermark is embedded through a modified scalar Costa quantization of the zero-order volume moments of some selected candidate patches.

Here. we pair recent advances in cloud computing using the geospatial platform of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) with optical remote sensing technology using the open Sentinel-2 archive. obtaining low-cost in situ collected data to develop an empirical preprocessing workflow for estimating satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). The workflow implements widely used and well-established algorithms. including cloud. atmospheric. and sun glint corrections. image composition and radiometric normalisation to address intra-and inter-image interferences before training. and validation of four SDB algorithms in three sites of the Aegean Sea in the Eastern Mediterranean. Best accuracy values for training and validation were R 2= 0.79. RMSE= 1.39 m. and R 2= 0.9. RMSE= 1.67 m. respectively. The increased accuracy highlights the importance of the radiometric normalisation given spatially independent calibration and validation datasets. Spatial error maps reveal over-prediction over low-reflectance and very shallow seabeds. and under-prediction over high-reflectance (< 6 m) and optically deep bottoms (> 17 m).

In this work. we present an alternative approach for traffic monitoring during disaster and mass events. which is based on an airborne optical sensor system. With this system. optical image sequences are automatically examined on board an aircraft to estimate road traffic information. such as vehicle positions. velocities and driving directions. The traffic information. estimated in real time on board. is immediately downlinked to a ground station. The airborne sensor system consists of a three-head camera system. a real-time-capable GPS/INS unit. five industrial PCs and a downlink unit. The processing chain for automatic extraction of traffic information contains modules for the synchronization of image and navigation data streams. orthorectification and vehicle detection and tracking modules. The vehicle detector is based on a combination of AdaBoost and support vector machine classifiers. Vehicle tracking relies on shape-based matching operators. The processing chain is evaluated on a large number of image sequences recorded during several campaigns. and the data quality is compared to that obtained from induction loops. In summary. we can conclude that the achieved overall quality of the traffic data extracted by the airborne system is in the range of 68% and 81%.

The weights are based on image features and represent the affinity between different pixels in the image. By prescribing different formulas for the weights. one can generalize many local and nonlocal linear denoising algorithms. including the nonlocal means filter and the bilateral filter. In this framework one can easily show that continuous iterations of the generalized filter obey certain global characteristics and converge to a constant solution. The linear operator associated with the Euler–Lagrange equation of the functional is closely related to the graph Laplacian.

VLsM,,,,Denoising algorithms based on gradient dependent energy functionals. such as Perona-Malik and total variation denoising. modify images towards piecewise constant functions. Although edge sharpness and location is well preserved. important information. encoded in image features like textures or certain details. is often compromised in the process of denoising. We propose a mechanism that better preserves fine scale features in such denoising processes. This is accomplished by adding a spatially varying fidelity term that locally controls the extent of denoising over image regions according to their content. Local variance measures of the oscillatory part of the signal are used to compute the adaptive fidelity term. Our results show improvement in the signal-tonoise ratio over scalar fidelity term processes. and they are more appealing visually.

Heidelberg,We address the issue of regularizing Osher and Rudin’s shock filter. used for image deblurring. in order to allow processes that are more robust against noise. Previous solutions to the problem suggested adding some sort of diffusion term to the shock equation. We analyze and prove some properties of coupled shock and diffusion processes. Finally we propose an original solution of adding a complex diffusion term to the shock equation. This new term is used to smooth out noise and indicate inflection points simultaneously. The imaginary value. which is an approximated smoothed second derivative scaled by time. is used to control the process.

In this review. we consider together fluorescence microscopy and optical/infrared astronomy because of two common features: in both cases the imaging system can be described. with a sufficiently good approximation. by a convolution operator. whose kernel is the so-called point-spread function (PSF); moreover. the data are affected by photon noise. described by a Poisson process. This statistical property of the noise. that is common also to emission tomography. is the basis of maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches introduced in the mid eighties. From then on. a huge amount of literature has been produced on these topics.

We present two methods for achieving such a result in the case of 3‐D fluorescent objects.The first method applies to conventional CSLM. where the image is detected only on the optical axis for any scanning position.

To keep a good level of security. reliable spoofing detection tools are necessary. preferably implemented as software modules. The research in this field is very active. with local descriptors. based on the analysis of microtextural features. gaining more and more popularity. because of their excellent performance and flexibility. This paper aims at assessing the potential of these descriptors for the liveness detection task in authentication systems based on various biometric traits: fingerprint. iris. and face.

Countless applications are possible. some of which raise a legitimate alarm. calling for reliable detectors of fake videos. In fact. distinguishing between original and manipulated video can be a challenge for humans and computers alike. especially when the videos are compressed or have low resolution. as it often happens on social networks. Research on the detection of face manipulations has been seriously hampered by the lack of adequate datasets. To this end. we introduce a novel face manipulation dataset of about half a million edited images (from over 1000 videos). The manipulations have been generated with a state-of-the-art face editing approach. It exceeds all existing video manipulation datasets by at least an order of magnitude. Using our new dataset. we introduce benchmarks for classical image forensic tasks. including classification and segmentation. considering videos compressed at various quality levels. In addition. we introduce a benchmark evaluation for creating indistinguishable forgeries with known ground truth; for instance with generative refinement models.,True,HItjEd0AAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC,154,https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09179,7741775166534199368,/scholar?cites=7741775166534199368,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09179,0,0,0

SAR images. however. suffer from strong fluctuations due to the speckle phenomenon inherent to coherent imagery. Hence. all derived parameters display strong signal-dependent variance. preventing the full exploitation of such a wealth of information. Even with the abundance of despeckling techniques proposed over the last three decades. there is still a pressing need for new methods that can handle this variety of SAR products and efficiently eliminate speckle without sacrificing the spatial resolution. Recently. patch-based filtering has emerged as a highly successful concept in image processing.

1279476,Noiseprint: a CNN-based camera model fingerprint,2020,Davide Cozzolino and Luisa Verdoliva,,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,,,,Forensic analyses of digital images rely heavily on the traces of in-camera and out-camera processes left on the acquired images. Such traces represent a sort of camera fingerprint. If one is able to recover them. by suppressing the high-level scene content and other disturbances. a number of forensic tasks can be easily accomplished. A notable example is the PRNU pattern. which can be regarded as a device fingerprint. and has received great attention in multimedia forensics. In this paper we propose a method to extract a camera model fingerprint. called noiseprint. where the scene content is largely suppressed and model-related artifacts are enhanced. This is obtained by means of a Siamese network. which is trained with pairs of image patches coming from the same (label+ 1) or different (label-1) cameras. Although noiseprints can be used for a large variety of forensic tasks. here we focus on image forgery localization. Experiments on several datasets widespread in the forensic community show noiseprint-based methods to provide state-of-the-art performance.,True,HItjEd0AAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC,128,https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08396,10213241576955169251,/scholar?cites=10213241576955169251,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08396,0,0,0

Rain streaks impair visibility of an image and introduce undesirable interference that can severely affect the performance of computer vision algorithms. Rain streak removal can be formulated as a layer decomposition problem. with a rain streak layer superimposed on a background layer containing the true scene content. Existing decomposition methods that address this problem employ either dictionary learning methods or impose a low rank structure on the appearance of the rain streaks. While these methods can improve the overall visibility. they tend to leave too many rain streaks in the background image or over-smooth the background image. In this paper. we propose an effective method that uses simple patch-based priors for both the background and rain layers. These priors are based on Gaussian mixture models and can accommodate multiple orientations and scales of the rain streaks. This simple approach removes rain streaks better than the existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Our core ideas lie in our new rain image model and new deep learning architecture. We add a binary map that provides rain streak locations to an existing model. which comprises a rain streak layer and a background layer. We create a model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation (where individual streaks cannot be seen. and thus visually similar to mist or fog). and another component representing various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks. which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the model. we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the binary rain streak map. the appearance of rain streaks. and the clean background. which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is critically beneficial. since its loss function can provide additional strong information to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again. a phenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks. we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal network that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation iteratively and progressively. In each recurrence of our method. a new contextualized dilated network is developed to exploit regional contextual information and to produce better representations for rain detection.

1279494,Attentive generative adversarial network for raindrop removal from a single image,2018,Rui Qian and Robby T Tan and Wenhan Yang and Jiajun Su and Jiaying Liu,,,,2482-2491,,Raindrops adhered to a glass window or camera lens can severely hamper the visibility of a background scene and degrade an image considerably. In this paper. we address the problem by visually removing raindrops. and thus transforming a raindrop degraded image into a clean one. The problem is intractable. since first the regions occluded by raindrops are not given. Second. the information about the background scene of the occluded regions is completely lost for most part. To resolve the problem. we apply an attentive generative network using adversarial training. Our main idea is to inject visual attention into both the generative and discriminative networks. During the training. our visual attention learns about raindrop regions and their surroundings. Hence. by injecting this information. the generative network will pay more attention to the raindrop regions and the surrounding structures. and the discriminative network will be able to assess the local consistency of the restored regions. This injection of visual attention to both generative and discriminative networks is the main contribution of this paper.

Statistics-based methods require many surface colors and become error prone when there are only a few surface colors. In contrast. dichromatic-based methods can successfully handle uniformly colored surfaces but cannot be applied to highly textured surfaces. since they require precise color segmentation. We present a single integrated method to estimate illumination chromaticity from single-colored and multicolored surfaces.

1279497,Nighttime haze removal with glow and multiple light colors,2015,Yu Li and Robby T Tan and Michael S Brown,,,,226-234,,This paper focuses on dehazing nighttime images. Most existing dehazing methods use models that are formulated to describe haze in daytime. Daytime models assume a single uniform light color attributed to a light source not directly visible in the scene. Nighttime scenes. however. commonly include visible lights sources with varying colors. These light sources also often introduce noticeable amounts of glow that is not present in daytime haze. To address these effects. we introduce a new nighttime haze model that accounts for the varying light sources and their glow. Our model is a linear combination of three terms: the direct transmission. airlight and glow. The glow term represents light from the light sources that is scattered around before reaching the camera. Based on the model. we propose a framework that first reduces the effect of the glow in the image. resulting in a nighttime image that consists of direct transmission and airlight only. We then compute a spatially varying atmospheric light map that encodes light colors locally. This atmospheric map is used to predict the transmission. which we use to obtain our nighttime scene reflection image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our nighttime haze model and correction method on a number of examples and compare our results with existing daytime and nighttime dehazing methods' results.,True,MOD0gv4AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,128,https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/html/Li_Nighttime_Haze_Removal_ICCV_2015_paper.html,4322878443020855291,/scholar?cites=4322878443020855291,,,https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Li_Nighttime_Haze_Removal_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf,0,0,0

However. in the real world. the presence of specular reflections is inevitable since there are many dielectric inhomogeneous objects which have both diffuse and specular reflections. To resolve this problem. we present a method to separate the two reflection components. The method is principally based on the distribution of specular and diffuse points in a two-dimensional maximum chromaticity-intensity space. We found that. by utilizing the space and known illumination color. the problem of reflection component separation can be simplified into the problem of identifying diffuse maximum chromaticity. To be able to identity the diffuse maximum chromaticity correctly. an analysis of the noise is required since most real images suffer from it.

Unlike previous approaches that learn Mahalanobis-like distance metrics in some transformed feature space. we propose to learn a dictionary that is capable of discriminatively and sparsely encoding features representing different people. Our approach directly addresses two key challenges in person re-identification: viewpoint variations and discriminability. First. to tackle viewpoint and associated appearance changes. we learn a single dictionary to represent both gallery and probe images in the training phase. We then discriminatively train the dictionary by enforcing explicit constraints on the associated sparse representations of the feature vectors. In the testing phase. we re-identify a probe image by simply determining the gallery image that has the closest sparse representation to that of the probe image in the Euclidean sense.

This paper proposes two ways to deal with this problem. One way is to reuse the features in blocks to construct the HOG features for intersecting detection windows. Another way is to utilize sub-cell based interpolation to efficiently compute the HOG features for each block. The combination of the two ways results in significant increase in detecting humans—more than five times better. To evaluate the proposed method. we have established a top-view human database.

Degraded underwater images show some limitations when they are used for display and analysis. For example. underwater images with low contrast and color cast decrease the accuracy rate of underwater object detection and marine biology recognition. To overcome those limitations. a systematic underwater image enhancement method. which includes an underwater image dehazing algorithm and a contrast enhancement algorithm. is proposed. Built on a minimum information loss principle. an effective underwater image dehazing algorithm is proposed to restore the visibility. color. and natural appearance of underwater images.

Interference between directed eye movements and manual probes is used to trace both the capacity utilization and spatial distribution of attention during eye movements.

In this study. when the security returns are taken as trapezoidal. triangular. and Gaussian fuzzy numbers. several crisp equivalent models of the VaR-FPSM are derived. which can be handled by any linear programming solvers. In general situations. an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm on the basis of fuzzy simulation is designed to search for the approximate optimal solutions. To illustrate the proposed model and the behavior of the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. two numerical examples are provided. and the results are discussed. Furthermore. the proposed algorithm is compared with some existing approaches …,True,pU-e-HoAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,99,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5752840/,10823837193306758899,/scholar?cites=10823837193306758899,,,,0,0,0
1279539,Building confidence-interval-based fuzzy random regression models,2009,Junzo Watada and Shuming Wang and Witold Pedrycz,17,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,6,1273-1283,IEEE,In real-world regression analysis. statistical data may be linguistically imprecise or vague. Given the co-existence of stochastic and fuzzy uncertainty. real data cannot be characterized by using only the formalism of random variables. In order to address regression problems in the presence of such hybrid uncertain data. fuzzy random variables are introduced in this study to serve as an integral component of regression models. A new class of fuzzy regression models that is based on fuzzy random data is built. and is called the confidence-interval-based fuzzy random regression model (CI-FRRM). First. a general fuzzy regression model for fuzzy random data is introduced. Then. using expectations and variances of fuzzy random variables. sigma-confidence intervals are constructed for fuzzy random input-output data. The CI-FRRM is established based on the sigma-confidence intervals.

In this paper. a two-stage fuzzy facility location problem with value-at-risk (VaR). called VaR-FFLP. is proposed. which results in a two-stage fuzzy zero-one integer programming problem. Some properties of the VaR-FFLP. including the value of perfect information (VPI). the value of fuzzy solution (VFS). and the bounds of the fuzzy solution. are discussed. Since the fuzzy parameters of the location problem are represented in the form of continuous fuzzy variables. the determination of VaR is inherently an infinite-dimensional optimization problem that cannot be solved analytically. Therefore. a method based on the discretization of the fuzzy variables is proposed to approximate the VaR.

Soft-computing methodologies are widely employed in financial engineering. Many problems of decision-making in investment have mainly been studied from optimizing points of view. As the investment is much influenced by the disturbance of a social and economical circumstances. optimization approach is not always the best. It is because problems used to be ill-structured under such influences. Therefore. a satisfaction approach is much better than an optimization one. In this discussion. we employ the aspiration level on the base of past experiences and knowledge possessed by a decision maker to treat a problem. That is. the aspiration level of the decision maker should be considered to solve a problem from the perspective of satisfaction strategy.

Many of these systems suffer from high false-alarm rates (often hundreds of false alarms per day) and poor detection of new attacks. Poor performance can be improved using a combination of discriminative training and generic keywords. Generic keywords are selected to detect attack preparations. the actual break-in. and actions after the break-in. Discriminative training weights keyword counts to discriminate between the few attack sessions where keywords are known to occur and the many normal sessions where keywords may occur in other contexts.

We develop. analyze. and apply a new finite mixture model based on a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution. The generalized Dirichlet distribution has a more general covariance structure than the Dirichlet distribution and offers high flexibility and ease of use for the approximation of both symmetric and asymmetric distributions. We show that the mathematical properties of this distribution allow high-dimensional modeling without requiring dimensionality reduction and. thus. without a loss of information. This makes the generalized Dirichlet distribution more practical and useful. We propose a hybrid stochastic expectation maximization algorithm (HSEM) to estimate the parameters of the generalized Dirichlet mixture.

1279569,Human action recognition using factorized spatio-temporal convolutional networks,2015,Lin Sun and Kui Jia and Dit-Yan Yeung and Bertram E Shi,,,,4597-4605,,Human actions in video sequences are three-dimensional (3D) spatio-temporal signals characterizing both the visual appearance and motion dynamics of the involved humans and objects. Inspired by the success of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification. recent attempts have been made to learn 3D CNNs for recognizing human actions in videos. However. partly due to the high complexity of training 3D convolution kernels and the need for large quantities of training videos. only limited success has been reported. This has triggered us to investigate in this paper a new deep architecture which can handle 3D signals more effectively. Specifically. we propose factorized spatio-temporal convolutional networks (FstCN) that factorize the original 3D convolution kernel learning as a sequential process of learning 2D spatial kernels in the lower layers (called spatial convolutional layers). followed by learning 1D temporal kernels in the upper layers (called temporal convolutional layers). We introduce a novel transformation and permutation operator to make factorization in FstCN possible. Moreover. to address the issue of sequence alignment. we propose an effective training and inference strategy based on sampling multiple video clips from a given action video sequence. We have tested FstCN on two commonly used benchmark datasets (UCF-101 and HMDB-51). Without using auxiliary training videos to boost the performance.

1279575,DL-SFA: Deeply-learned slow feature analysis for action recognition,2014,Lin Sun and Kui Jia and Tsung-Han Chan and Yuqiang Fang and Gang Wang and Shuicheng Yan,,,,2625-2632,,Most of the previous work on video action recognition use complex hand-designed local features. such as SIFT. HOG and SURF. but these approaches are implemented sophisticatedly and difficult to be extended to other sensor modalities. Recent studies discover that there are no universally best hand-engineered features for all datasets. and learning features directly from the data may be more advantageous. One such endeavor is Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) proposed by Wiskott and Sejnowski. SFA can learn the invariant and slowly varying features from input signals and has been proved to be valuable in human action recognition. It is also observed that the multi-layer feature representation has succeeded remarkably in widespread machine learning applications. In this paper. we propose to combine SFA with deep learning techniques to learn hierarchical representations from the video data itself. Specifically. we use a two-layered SFA learning structure with 3D convolution and max pooling operations to scale up the method to large inputs and capture abstract and structural features from the video. Thus. the proposed method is suitable for action recognition. At the same time. sharing the same merits of deep learning. the proposed method is generic and fully automated.

Accuracies of under 1 of visual angle are achieved over a field of view of 14x12x20 cm and over various hardware configurations. camera resolutions and frame rates.,True,nDpk_zMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,257,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1117309.1117349,11455654769077664993,/scholar?cites=11455654769077664993,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97.40&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

We present precise formulas for the NVF which enable a fast computation during the watermark encoding and decoding process. In order to determine the optimal NVF. we first consider the watermark as noise. Using a classical MAP image denoising approach. we show how to estimate the ”noise”.

This recalls an emerging demand in highly efficient counter-measures. i.e. steganalysis methods. Modern steganography is presented by a broad spectrum of various data-hiding techniques. Therefore development of corresponding steganalysis methods is rather a complex problem and challenging task. Moreover. in many practical steganalysis tasks second Kerckhoff’s principle is not applicable because of absence of information about the used steganography method. This motivates to use blind steganalysis. which can be applied to the certain techniques where one can specify at least statistics of the hidden data. This paper focuses on the class of supervised steganalysis techniques developed for the additive steganography. which can be described as y = f(x. s. K) = x + g(s.

Since then. the morphological profile has largely proved to be a powerful tool able to model spatial information (e.g.. contextual relations) of the image. However. due to the shortcomings of using the morphological profiles. many variants. extensions. and refinements of its definition have appeared stating that the morphological profile is still under continuous development. In this case. recently introduced theoretically sound attribute profiles (APs) can be considered as a generalization of the morphological profile. which is a powerful tool to model spatial information existing in the scene. Although the concept of the AP has been introduced in remote sensing only recently. an extensive literature on its use in different applications and on different types of data has appeared.

First. the dimensionality of the original face image is reduced by using the DCT and the large area illumination variations are alleviated by discarding the first few low-frequency DCT coefficients. Next. the truncated DCT coefficient vectors are clustered using the proposed clustering algorithm. This process makes the subsequent FLD more efficient. After implementing the FLD. the most discriminating and invariant facial features are maintained and the training samples are clustered well. As a consequence. further parameter estimation for the RBF neural networks is fulfilled easily which facilitates fast training in the RBF neural networks.

In this paper. a weighted guided image filter (WGIF) is introduced by incorporating an edge-aware weighting into an existing guided image filter (GIF) to address the problem. The WGIF inherits advantages of both global and local smoothing filters in the sense that: 1) the complexity of the WGIF is O(N) for an image with N pixels. which is same as the GIF and 2) the WGIF can avoid halo artifacts like the existing global smoothing filters. The WGIF is applied for single image detail enhancement. single image haze removal. and fusion of differently exposed images. Experimental results show that the resultant algorithms produce images with better visual quality and at the same time halo artifacts can be reduced/avoided from appearing in the final images with negligible increment on running times.,True,wBNGkEMAAAAJ:b2v3RnpdjZkC,319,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6957555/,12266759837613794583,/scholar?cites=12266759837613794583,,,https://oar.a-star.edu.sg/jspui/bitstream/123456789/1545/1/IEEETIPWGIF_Double_3rdRound.pdf,0,0,0

Applications in civil. industrial and healthcare fields are thus reaching a high level of technical performance. The relationship between body temperature and disease was documented since 400 bc. In many diseases there are variations in blood flow. and these in turn affect the skin temperature. IR imaging offers a useful and non-invasive approach to the diagnosis and treatment (as therapeutic aids) of many disorders. in particular in the areas of rheumatology. dermatology. orthopaedics and circulatory abnormalities.

To tackle this problem. a skin heat transfer (SHT) model based on thermal physiology is derived in this paper. The proposed model converts the facial thermograms into blood-perfusion data. which is revealed to reduce the within-class scatter of face images. The advantage of the derived blood-perfusion data over the raw thermograms for recognition is analyzed by the normalized reverse cumulative histogram. It is shown that blood-perfusion data are more consistent in representing facial features.

Although there is no consensus about what a good view means in Computer Graphics. the quality of a viewpoint is intuitively related to how much information it gives us about a scene. In this paper we use the theoretical basis provided by Information Theory to define a new measure. viewpoint entropy. that allows us to compute good viewing positions automatically.

The user selects a focus. i.e.. object of interest. from a set of pre-defined features. Our system automatically determines the most expressive view on this feature. A characteristic viewpoint is estimated by a novel information-theoretic framework which is based on the mutual information measure. Viewpoints change smoothly by switching the focus from one feature to another one. This mechanism is controlled by changes in the importance distribution among features in the volume. The highest importance is assigned to the feature in focus. Apart from viewpoint selection. the focusing mechanism also steers visual emphasis by assigning a visually more prominent representation. To allow a clear view on features that are normally occluded by other parts of the volume. the focusing for example incorporates cut-away views,True,oSNQVNgAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC,244,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4015449/,14364218957696028432,/scholar?cites=14364218957696028432,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.169.7484&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Inc, In the last decade a new family of methods. namely Image‐Based Rendering. has appeared. These techniques rely on the use of precomputed images to totally or partially substitute the geometric representation of the scene. This allows to obtain realistic renderings even with modest resources. The main problem is the amount of data needed. mainly due to the high redundancy and the high computational cost of capture. In this paper we present a new method to automatically determine the correct camera placement positions in order to obtain a minimal set of views for Image‐Based Rendering. The input is a 3D polyhedral model including textures and the output is a set of views that sample all visible polygons at an appropriate rate.

In this framework. a feature subset is selected based on the corresponding score (subset-level score). which is calculated in a trace ratio form. Since the number of all possible feature subsets is very huge. it is often prohibitively expensive in computational cost to search in a brute force manner for the feature subset with the maximum subset-level score. Instead of calculating the scores of all the feature subsets. traditional methods calculate the score for each feature. and then select the leading features based on the rank of these feature-level scores. However. selecting the feature subset based on the feature-level score cannot guarantee the optimum of the subset-level score.

How to conduct semi-supervised feature selection on large-scale datasets has become a challenging research problem.

In that work. a greedy strategy was applied due to the difficulty of directly solving the l1-norm maximization problem. which is easy to get stuck in local solution. In this paper. we first propose an efficient optimization algorithm to solve a general l1-norm maximization problem. and then propose a robust principal component analysis with non-greedy l1-norm maximization.

In practice. due to lacking labeled data. the unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithms are more desired. Among them. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the most widely used approach. In recent research. several robust PCA algorithms were presented to enhance the robustness of PCA model. However. all existing robust PCA methods incorrectly center the data using the L2-norm distance to calculate the mean. which actually is not the optimal mean due to the L1-norm used in the objective functions. It is non-trivial to remove the optimal mean in the robust PCA. because of the sparsity-inducing norms used in the robust formulations. In this paper. we propose novel robust PCA objective functions with removing optimal mean automatically. We naturally integrate the mean calculation into the dimensionality reduction optimization. such that the optimal mean can be obtained to enhance the dimensionality reduction.

Zhang,44,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,1,40-53,IEEE,This paper investigates how to use prediction strategies to improve the performance of multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithms in dealing with dynamic environments. Prediction-based methods have been applied to predict some isolated points in both dynamic single objective optimization and dynamic multiobjective optimization. We extend this idea to predict a whole population by considering the properties of continuous dynamic multiobjective optimization problems. In our approach. called population prediction strategy (PPS). a Pareto set is divided into two parts: a center point and a manifold. A sequence of center points is maintained to predict the next center. and the previous manifolds are used to estimate the next manifold. Thus. PPS could initialize a whole population by combining the predicted center and estimated manifold when a change is detected. We systematically compare PPS with a …,True,E4GQv5cAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,222,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6471286/,960021307472840171,/scholar?cites=960021307472840171,,,,0,0,0

Berlin. Heidelberg,Optimization in changing environment is a challenging task. especially when multiple objectives are to be optimized simultaneously. The basic idea to address dynamic optimization problems is to utilize history information to guide future search. In this paper. two strategies for population re-initialization are introduced when a change in the environment is detected. The first strategy is to predict the new location of individuals from the location changes that have occurred in the history. The current population is then partially or completely replaced by the new individuals generated based on prediction. The second strategy is to perturb the current population with a Gaussian noise whose variance is estimated according to previous changes. The prediction based population re-initialization strategies. together with the random re-initialization method. are then compared on two bi-objective test problems …,True,E4GQv5cAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,180,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-70928-2_62,7640653956408725620,/scholar?cites=7640653956408725620,,,http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/532831/1/EMO07.pdf,0,0,0
1279672,Approximating the set of Pareto-optimal solutions in both the decision and objective spaces by an estimation of distribution algorithm,2009,Aimin Zhou and Qingfu Zhang and Yaochu Jin,13,IEEE transactions on evolutionary computation,5,1167-1189,IEEE,Most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms aim at approximating the Pareto front (PF). which is the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the objective space. In many real-life applications. however. a good approximation to the Pareto set (PS). which is the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the decision space. is also required by a decision maker. This paper considers a class of multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). in which the dimensionalities of the PS and the PF manifolds are different so that a good approximation to the PF might not approximate the PS very well. It proposes a probabilistic model-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. called MMEA. for approximating the PS and the PF simultaneously for an MOP in this class.

This paper proposes a global replacement scheme which assigns a new solution to its most suitable subproblems.

Resource allocation in decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms,2015,Aimin Zhou and Qingfu Zhang,20,IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation,1,52-64,IEEE,Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) decompose a multiobjective optimization problem into a set of scalar objective subproblems and solve them in a collaborative way. A naïve way to distribute computational effort is to treat all the subproblems equally and assign the same computational resource to each subproblem. This paper proposes a generalized resource allocation (GRA) strategy for decomposition-based MOEAs by using a probability of improvement vector. Each subproblem is chosen to invest according to this vector. An offline measurement and an online measurement of the subproblem hardness are used to maintain and update this vector. Utility functions are proposed and studied for implementing a reasonable and stable online resource allocation strategy.

To improve the algorithm performance. the ensemble of multiple operators has become popular. Most ensemble techniques achieve this goal by choosing an operator according to a probability learned from the previous experience. In contrast to these ensemble techniques. in this paper we propose a cheap surrogate model-based multioperator search strategy for evolutionary optimization. In our approach. a set of candidate offspring solutions are generated by using the multiple offspring reproduction operators. and the best one according to the surrogate model is chosen as the offspring solution. Two major advantages of this approach are: 1) each operator can generate a solution for competition compared to the probability-based approaches and 2) the …,True,E4GQv5cAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,94,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7132771/,12902206740013722929,/scholar?cites=12902206740013722929,,,,0,0,0

There is considerable evidence that phasic dopamine signals encode prediction error (differences between expected and actual outcomes). with reinforcement learning theories being based on prediction error-mediated learning of associations. It has been hypothesized that abnormal encoding of neural prediction error signals could underlie anhedonia in depression and negative symptoms in schizophrenia by disrupting learning and blunting the salience of rewarding events. and contribute to psychotic symptoms by promoting aberrant perceptions and the formation of delusions.

An accepted theory. which broadly accounts for features of the syndrome. and its delayed response to antidepressant medication. is lacking. One possibility. which has received considerable attention. is that depressive illness is associated with a specific underlying deficit: a blunted or impaired ability to respond to feedback information. Unlike healthy controls. if patients with a depressive illness commit an error. they can be at increased risk of committing a subsequent error. possibly due to a failure to adjust performance in order to reduce the risk of error. In some speeded tasks. performance adjustment in humans is reliably associated with trial-to-trial change in reaction times (RTs). such as ‘post-error slowing’.

We term this problem on-line plan recognition under uncertainty and view it generally as probabilistic inference on the stochastic process representing the execution of the agent's plan. Our contributions in this paper are twofold. In terms of probabilistic inference. we introduce the Abstract Hidden Markov Model (AHMM). a novel type of stochastic processes. provide its dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) structure and analyse the properties of this network. We then describe an application of the Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter to the AHMM which allows us to construct an efficient. hybrid inference method for this model. In terms of plan recognition. we propose a novel plan recognition framework based on the AHMM as the plan execution model. The Rao-Blackwellised hybrid inference for AHMM can take advantage of the independence properties inherent in a model of plan execution. leading to an algorithm for online probabilistic plan recognition that scales well with the number of levels in the plan hierarchy. This illustrates that while stochastic models for plan execution can be complex. they exhibit special structures which. if exploited. can lead to efficient plan recognition algorithms.

1279692,Recognizing and monitoring high-level behaviors in complex spatial environments,2003,Nam Thanh Nguyen and Hung Hai Bui and S Venkatsh and Geoff West,2,,,II-620,IEEE,The recognition of activities from sensory data is important in advanced surveillance systems to enable prediction of high-level goals and intentions of the target under surveillance. The problem is complicated by sensory noise and complex activity spanning large spatial and temporal extents. The paper presents a system for recognizing high-level human activities from multi-camera video data in complex spatial environments. The Abstract Hidden Markov mEmory Model (AHMEM) is used to deal with noise and scalability. The AHMEM is an extension of the Abstract Hidden Markov Model (AHMM) that allows us to represent a richer class of both state-dependent and context-free behaviors. The model also supports integration with low-level sensory models and efficient probabilistic inference.

1279693,Hierarchical recognition of intentional human gestures for sports video annotation,2002,Graeme S Chambers and Svetha Venkatesh and Geoff AW West and Hung Hai Bui,2,,,1082-1085,IEEE,We present a novel technique for the recognition of complex human gestures for video annotation using accelerometers and the hidden Markov model. Our extension to the standard hidden Markov model allows us to consider gestures at different levels of abstraction through a hierarchy of hidden states. Accelerometers in the form of wrist bands are attached to humans performing intentional gestures. such as umpires in sports. Video annotation is then performed by populating the video with time stamps indicating significant events. where a particular gesture occurs. The novelty of the technique lies in the development of a probabilistic hierarchical framework for complex gesture recognition and the use of accelerometers to extract gestures and significant events for video annotation.,True,Sr_EY38AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,130,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1048493/,16640517743591702960,/scholar?cites=16640517743591702960,,,http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30044650/venkatesh-hierarchicalrecognition-2002.pdf,0,0,0
1279694,Tracking and surveillance in wide-area spatial environments using the Abstract Hidden Markov Model,2001,Hung H Bui and Svetha Venkatesh and Geoff West,,,,177-195,,In this paper. we consider the problem of tracking an object and predicting the object's future trajectory in a wide-area environment. with complex spatial layout and the use of multiple sensors/cameras. To solve this problem. there is a need for representing the dynamic and noisy data in the tracking tasks. and dealing with them at different levels of detail. We employ the Abstract Hidden Markov Models (AHMM). an extension of the well-known Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a special type of Dynamic Probabilistic Network (DPN). as our underlying representation framework. The AHMM allows us to explicitly encode the hierarchy of connected spatial locations. making it scalable to the size of the environment being modeled. We describe an application for tracking human movement in an office-like spatial layout where the AHMM is used to track and predict the evolution of object trajectories at different levels of detail.,True,Sr_EY38AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,129,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812797605_0009,16722522221164639872,/scholar?cites=16722522221164639872,,,,0,0,0

One is based on a robust z-score and the other uses a Mahalanobis type robust distance.

The methods estimate the best-fit-plane based on most probable outlier free. and most consistent. points set in a local neighbourhood. Then the normal and curvature from the best-fit-plane will be highly robust to noise and outliers.

Applications include automatic inspection. surveying. remote sensing and photogrammetry. Sensors. at the present time. require subpixel methods to improve the resolution above that available given the spacing of sensing elements and the analogue to digital conversion resolution. This paper reviews proposed subpixel methods in the context of an increasingly important application. namely. the determination of the position of a laser spot on a sensing array for triangulation. A number of techniques are chosen and analysed experimentally. Their performances are compared and contrasted with respect to spatial resolution. quantisation accuracy and noise.
