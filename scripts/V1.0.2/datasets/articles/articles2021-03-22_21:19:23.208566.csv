1212519,Scanning tomographic particle image velocimetry applied to a turbulent jet,2013,TA Casey and J Sakakibara and Sigurdur T Thoroddsen,25,Physics of fluids,2,025102,American Institute of Physics,We introduce a modified tomographic PIV technique using four high-speed video cameras and a scanning pulsed laser-volume. By rapidly illuminating adjacent subvolumes onto separate video frames. we can resolve a larger total volume of velocity vectors. while retaining good spatial resolution. We demonstrate this technique by performing time-resolved measurements of the turbulent structure of a round jet. using up to 9 adjacent volume slices. In essence this technique resolves more velocity planes in the depth direction by maintaining optimal particle image density and limiting the number of ghost particles. The total measurement volumes contain between 1 ×106 and 3 ×106 velocity vectors calculated from up to 1500 reconstructed depthwise image planes. showing time-resolved evolution of the large-scale vortical structures for a turbulent jet of Re up to 10 000.,True,FS0jZm4AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,37,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4790640,15670357122781565796,/scholar?cites=15670357122781565796,,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/552108/1.4790640.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Since combustion diagnostics and flame control strategies based on electric fields depend on the amount of current drawn from flames. there is significant interest in modeling and understanding i− V curves. We implement and apply a detailed model for the simulation of the production and transport of ions and electrons in one-dimensional premixed flames. An analytical reduced model is developed based on the detailed one. and analytical expressions are used to gain insight into the characteristics of the i− V curve for various flame configurations. In order for the reduced model to capture the spatial distribution of the electric field accurately. the concept of a dead zone region. where voltage is constant. is introduced. and a suitable closure for the spatial extent of the dead zone is proposed …,True,FS0jZm4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,17,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748916300566,5922994085310277071,/scholar?cites=5922994085310277071,,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/617074/paper.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Often. the uncertainty in transport data is either not considered or not quantified when validating kinetic mechanisms. Although different methods have been implemented in which molecular parameters are used to calculate the coefficients of diffusion. viscosity. and thermal conductivity subsequently used in chemical kinetic models. the molecular parameters themselves are subject to experimental uncertainty and thus their effects on combustion simulations should be quantified. For this initial framework. we examine decades of experiments in the literature and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate uncertainties on the collision diameters and well depths of molecules frequently encountered in combustion simulations.

1212526,Electric field effects in combustion with non-thermal plasma,2016,Tiernan Albert Casey,,,,,,Chemically reacting zones such as flames act as sources of charged species and can thus be considered as weakly-ionized plasmas. As such. the action of an externally applied electric field has the potential to affect the dynamics of reaction zones by enhancing transport. altering the local chemical composition. activating reaction pathways. and by providing additional thermal energy through the interaction of electrons with neutral molecules. To investigate these effects. one-dimensional simulations of reacting flows are performed including the treatment of charged species transport and non-thermal electron chemistry using a modified reacting fluid solver. A particular area of interest is that of plasma assisted ignition. which is investigated in a canonical one-dimensional configuration. An incipient ignition kernel. formed by localized energy deposition into a lean mixture of methane and air at atmospheric pressure. is subjected to sub-breakdown electric fields by applied voltages across the domain. resulting in non-thermal behavior of the electron sub-fluid formed during the discharge. Strong electric fields cause charged species to be rapidly transported from the ignition zone across the domain in opposite directions as charge fronts. augmenting the magnitude of the electric field in the fresh gas during the pulse through a dynamic-electrode effect. This phenomenon results in an increase in the energy of the electrons in the fresh mixture with increasing time. accelerating electron impact dissociation processes.

1212542,Uncertainty of transport parameters in flame models: a database from virial coefficient measurements,2017,Daniel I Pineda and Tiernan A Casey and Xian Shi and Jyh-Yuan Chen,,,,,,In combustion models. the uncertainty in transport data is often either not considered or not quantified when validating chemical kinetic mechanisms. The molecular parameters used to determine the coefficients of diffusivity. viscosity. and thermal conductivity are subject to experimental uncertainty and thus can influence model predictions. In this study. we build on previous efforts establishing a framework for quantifying the uncertainty in flame models due to transport. We examine decades of experimental data on the coefficients of the virial equation of state for several key combustion molecules. and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to generate a distribution of possible fits consistent with the data. With these distributions. we establish a new publicly-available transport database and combine it with a relatively untuned mechanism in the literature. propagating the distributions through transport models and flame models to obtain uncertainties on species diffusivities and flame speed. Results show significant differences from established parameter values for some species. and that the uncertainty in flame behavior from transport uncertainty is largely governed by the species that dominate the fresh gas mixture. along with species involved in rate-limiting reactions.

In order to obtain an uncertain representation of this reaction rate in the absence of actual experimental data. we perform an inference procedure employing maximum entropy and approximate Bayesian computation methods to discover hypothetical data from a target shock-tube experiment designed to measure the reverse reaction rate. This method attempts to invert the fitting procedure from noisy measurement data to parameters. with associated uncertainty specifications. to arrive at candidate noisy data sets consistent with these reported parameters and their uncertainties. The uncertainty structure of the Arrhenius parameters is obtained by fitting each hypothetical data set in a Bayesian framework and pooling the resulting joint parameter posterior densities to arrive at a consensus density. We highlight the advantages of working with a data-centric representation of the experimental uncertainty with regards to model choice and consistency. and the ability for combining experimental evidence from multiple sources.

The CP measurements are compared with measurements using an infrared (IR) camera; it was observed that the CP measurements were more accurate than IR measurements because IR measurements need knowledge of the surface’s emissivity.

In this work. the flaming ignition behavior of powdered cellulose fuel beds by hot steel and aluminum spheres of various diameters and initial temperatures was studied. Understanding ignition in this scenario could offer insight into the mechanisms by which metal particles initiate wildland fires and fires in industrial settings. Earlier work on this topic has shown that ignition propensity has a relationship with the temperature and diameter of the sphere.

We also observed that in the range of sphere diameters from 4-8 mm. aluminum spheres of a given diameter are more likely to cause ignition than their steel counterparts.

As cylindrical shrubs and twigs are typical fuel loads in wildfires. it is important to understand how the diameter and arrangement of cylindrical fuels affect ignition behaviors. In this work. the piloted ignition of cylindrical wood rods with different diameters (3.2 ~15.9 mm) are conducted under the irradiation up to 50 kW/m2. Three fuel groups are tested: (I) single vertical rod. (II) single horizontal rod. and (III) horizontal rod bed attached to the ground. For a single vertical rod. the measured ignition time decreases as the diameter is decreased from 15.9 mm to 6.4 mm. showing a thermally-thin behavior. However. the ignition of the 3.2-mm rod is more difficult than the 9.5-mm rod. because of the enhanced convective cooling by the smaller curvature. Nevertheless. when the rod fuels are placed horizontally on the ground. the curvature-enhanced convective cooling becomes limited. For a single rod. when both the fuel diameter and the irradiation are small. only smoldering ignition occurs. and eventually the sample collapses. For the rod bed. flaming ignition always occurs. and it is easier to ignite because of a smaller convective cooling. For both horizontal configurations. the fuel ignition temperature increases almost linearly with the diameter from 270℃ (3.2 mm) to 330℃ (15.9 mm) but is insensitive to the irradiation level. This research quantifies the effect of fuel diameter and arrangement on the piloted ignition and reveals that the traditional classification of thermally thin and thick fuel …,True,OuSyt3SI9NoC:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,7,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2019.00054/full,7621344719263080654,/scholar?cites=7621344719263080654,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2019.00054/full,0,0,0

The combustion reaction may be either a homogeneous gas phase reaction (flaming ignition) or a heterogeneous surface reaction (smolder ignition). For either combustion reaction to occur. the temperature of the fuel and air must first be elevated above a certain value. often termed the “ignition temperature.” so that the heat released by the combustion reaction is larger than the heat losses from the reaction.

This process occurs when embers from a fire upwind land on a fuel downwind. These embers may initiate a fire directly or a smolder. which later may transition to a flame in the fuel. The Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) plays an important role in determining whether a firebrand will ignite the fuel. In this work. the effect of FMC on the smoldering ignition of coastal redwood sawdust by a firebrand is studied experimentally. flaming ignition was not studied or observed. The firebrands were made from wooden cylinders of various sizes from 1.6 to 11 mm in diameter and length.

1212566,Ignition Behavior of Hot Spheres Landing in Combustible Fuel Beds,,Casey D Zak and James L Urban and A Carlos Fernandez-Pello,,,,,,According to the National Fire Protection Association of the United States. wild land fires caused more than $600 million dollars in property damage and killed 65 civilians in the year 2011 [1]. These fires are also responsible for significant biomass consumption and a large source of combustion emissions to the atmosphere [2. 3]. Clearly. wildland and Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) fires have caused significant environmental and property damage. as well as the loss of life. Some of these fires allegedly begin when hot metallic particles land in combustible fuel beds. such as duff. litter or sawdust. These particles can be the result of powerline interactions. grinding or other industrial activities. Currently. the exact process by which this ignition occurs and the conditions necessary to initiate a spot fire are not well understood. Consequently. current wildland fire models lack capabilities for accurately predicting the initiation of spot fires [4. 5]. A greater understanding of the ignition process and the conditions necessary for ignition could lead to improved predictive models and reduced losses due to fire.There are only a few studies published on the ignition of fuel beds by hot metal particles [6–10]. The work presented here focuses on the ignition of powdered cellulose fuel beds by hot metallic spheres. The goal of this approach is to use a simplified laboratory case to understand the controlling parameters and underlying mechanisms at work in real world ignition scenarios. We utilized high-speed radial Schlieren video to investigate ignition behavior over a range of sphere diameters and temperatures.

Before such cycles can be realized. fundamental research on fuel injection into argon and laboratory-scale engine tests are needed. We investigated non-reacting methane jets into argon and nitrogen atmospheres in a constant volume chamber using high-speed schlieren imaging. We subsequently assessed the feasibility of methane direct-injection in a modified single cylinder research engine with an argon-oxygen mixture as the working fluid. We compared engine performance by measuring fuel flow. in-cylinder pressure. torque. and emissions. Results show that the penetration depth and spread angles of methane jets are notably different but not significantly reduced in argon compared to nitrogen. Additionally. running the modified engine with an argon-oxygen mixture in compression ignition operation leads to improvements in efficiency up to 50 percent relative to spark-ignited air cycles. and NOX emissions are nearly eliminated. The results encourage more studies in which the exhausted argon is recycled into the intake.,True,ZiyqsoEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,5,http://danielipineda.com/Daniel_I._Pineda_files/USnational_2017_APC_DI.pdf,15733586251136530320,/scholar?cites=15733586251136530320,,http://danielipineda.com/Daniel_I._Pineda_files/USnational_2017_APC_DI.pdf,0,0,0

To avoid huge grid investments. coordinated charging of those vehicles is a must. In this paper. we assess algorithms to schedule charging of plug-in (hybrid) electric vehicles as to minimize the additional peak load they might cause. We first introduce two approaches. one based on a classical optimization approach using quadratic programming. and a second one. market based coordination. which is a multi-agent system that uses bidding on a virtual market to reach an equilibrium price that matches demand and supply. We benchmark these two methods against each other. as well as to a baseline scenario of uncontrolled charging.

In contrast to classical optical network design problems. it is typical of optical Grids that the destination of traffic (jobs) is not known beforehand. This leads to so-called anycast routing of jobs. For network dimensioning. this implies the absence of a clearly defined (source. destination)-based traffic matrix. since only the origin of Grid jobs (and their data) is known. but not their destination. The latter depends not only on the state of Grid resources. including network. storage. and computational resources. but also the Grid scheduling algorithm used.

To monitor residential energy consumption cost-effectively. i.e.. without relying on per-device monitoring equipment. non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) provides an elegant solution. The aim of NILM is to disaggregate the total power consumption (as measured. e.g.. by smart meters at the grid connection point of the household) into individual devices’ power consumption. using machine learning techniques. An essential building block of NILM is event detection: detecting when appliances are switched on or off. Current state-of-the-art methods face two open issues.

Because this can be impractical. a surrogate model is often used to approximate the dynamic behavior of the original simulator. This model can then be used as a cheap. drop-in replacement for the simulator.

Sequential design strategies offer a huge advantage over one-shot experimental designs because they can use information gathered from previous data points in order to determine the location of new data points.

Objective video quality metrics try to estimate perceived quality with high accuracy and in an automated manner. In traditional approaches. these metrics model the complex properties of the human visual system. More recently. however. it has been shown that machine learning approaches can also yield competitive results. In this paper. we present a novel no-reference bitstream-based objective video quality metric that is constructed by genetic programming-based symbolic regression.

It enables the analysis of small. simple as well as large and more complex systems in order to assess whether they function according to the intended design and as seen in simulation. Data science approaches have been successfully applied to analyze networked interactions in several research areas such as large-scale social networks. advanced business and healthcare processes. Wireless networks can exhibit unpredictable interactions between algorithms from multiple protocol layers. interactions between multiple devices. and hardware specific influences.

To tackle this. we employ a hybrid spectrum allocation approach whereby the spectrum is split between the macrocell and its nearby interfering femtocells based on their resource demands. whereas the distant femtocells share the entire spectrum. A multiobjective problem is formulated for resource allocation between femtocells and is decomposed using a lexicographic optimization approach into two subproblems. A greedy algorithm of reasonably low complexity is proposed to solve these subproblems sequentially.

However. the selfishness of autonomous users under such framework may lead to throughput unfairness which only benefits certain users. To alleviate this unfairness problem. the authors propose a payment-based power control scheme using game theory where each user announces a set of price coefficients that reflects different compensations paid by other users for the interference they produce. Users who generate higher interference are required to pay more by transmitting at a lower power to give other users a fairer chance of sharing the throughput. Without any incentive to play fairly. users could misbehave by broadcasting high price coefficients to force other users to transmit at a lower power.

To prove the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium (NE) in the proposed non-cooperative CA and PC game (NCPG). the authors break the NCPG into a CA subgame and a PC subgame.

However. the simulation of complex systems with multiple input and output parameters can be a very time-consuming process. Many of these high-fidelity simulators need minutes. hours or even days to perform one simulation. The goal of global surrogate modeling is to create an approximation model that mimics the original simulator. based on a limited number of expensive simulations. but can be evaluated much faster. The set of simulations performed to create this model is called the experimental design.

However. high-fidelity simulations may take hours or even days to compute. Because this can be impractical. a surrogate model is often used to approximate the dynamic behavior of the original simulator. This model can then be used as a cheap. drop-in replacement for the simulator.

Due to their compact formulation they are cheap to evaluate and thus readily facilitate visualization. design space exploration. rapid prototyping. and sensitivity analysis. They can also be used as accurate building blocks in design packages or larger simulation environments. Consequently. there is great interest in techniques that facilitate the construction of such approximation models while minimizing the computational cost and maximizing model accuracy.

Typically the model parameter (=hyperparameter) optimization problem as part of global surrogate modeling is formulated in a single objective way. Models are generated according to a single objective (accuracy). However. this requires an engineer to determine a single accuracy target and measure upfront. which is hard to do if the behavior of the response is unknown. Likewise. the different outputs of a multi-output system are typically modeled separately by independent models. Again. a multiobjective approach would benefit the domain expert by giving information about output correlation and enabling automatic model type selection for each output …,True,DBKrC1kAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C,63,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00366-009-0138-1.pdf,10567553420219165893,/scholar?cites=10567553420219165893,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/989126/file/989132.pdf,0,0,0

Yet. a major challenge is how to efficiently incorporate commonsense knowledge into such models. A recent approach regularizes relation and entity representations by propositionalization of first-order logic rules. However. propositionalization does not scale beyond domains with only few entities and rules. In this paper we present a highly efficient method for incorporating implication rules into distributed representations for automated knowledge base construction. We map entity-tuple embeddings into an approximately Boolean space and encourage a partial ordering over relation embeddings based on implication rules mined from WordNet. Surprisingly. we find that the strong restriction of the entity-tuple embedding space does not hurt the expressiveness of the model and even acts as a regularizer that improves generalization. By incorporating few commonsense rules. we achieve an increase of 2 percentage points mean average precision over a matrix factorization baseline. while observing a negligible increase in runtime.,True,x_0MCH4AAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,92,https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08359,5609500749880845472,/scholar?cites=5609500749880845472,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08359,0,0,0

Thus. the performance of such joint models depends on the quality of the features obtained from these NLP tools. However. these features are not always accurate for various languages and contexts. In this paper. we propose a joint neural model which performs entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously. without the need of any manually extracted features or the use of any external tool.

Traditional text similarity methods such as tf-idf cosine-similarity. based on word overlap. mostly fail to produce good results in this case. since word overlap is little or non-existent.

1212681,Adversarial sets for regularising neural link predictors,2017,Pasquale Minervini and Thomas Demeester and Tim Rocktäschel and Sebastian Riedel,,33rd Conf. on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2017),,,,In adversarial training. a set of models learn together by pursuing competing goals. usually defined on single data instances. However. in relational learning and other non-iid domains. goals can also be defined over sets of instances. For example. a link predictor for the is-a relation needs to be consistent with the transitivity property: if is-a (x_1. x_2) and is-a (x_2. x_3) hold. is-a (x_1. x_3) needs to hold as well. Here we use such assumptions for deriving an inconsistency loss. measuring the degree to which the model violates the assumptions on an adversarially-generated set of examples. The training objective is defined as a minimax problem. where an adversary finds the most offending adversarial examples by maximising the inconsistency loss. and the model is trained by jointly minimising a supervised loss and the inconsistency loss on the adversarial examples. This yields the first method that can use function-free Horn clauses (as in Datalog) to regularise any neural link predictor. with complexity independent of the domain size. We show that for several link prediction models. the optimisation problem faced by the adversary has efficient closed-form solutions.

Particular attention is devoted to elucidate the validity of the quasi-TM model and the approximations that have to be invoked to obtain this model. A new derivation of the complex capacitance matrix is given. especially taking into account the presence of semiconductors. This derivation automatically leads to a nonclassical circuit signal current definition and demands for a formulation of the complex inductance problem consistent with that definition.

1212697,Using active learning and semantic clustering for noise reduction in distant supervision,2014,Lucas Sterckx and Thomas Demeester and Johannes Deleu and Chris Develder,,,,1-6,,The use of external databases to generate training data. also known as Distant Supervision. has become an effective way to train supervised relation extractors but this approach inherently suffers from noise. In this paper we propose a method for noise reduction in distantly supervised training data. using a discriminative classifier and semantic similarity between the contexts of the training examples. We describe an active learning strategy which exploits hierarchical clustering of the candidate training samples. To further improve the effectiveness of this approach. we study the use of several methods for dimensionality reduction of the training samples. We find that semantic clustering of training data combined with cluster-based active learning allows filtering the training data. hence facilitating the creation of a clean training set for relation extraction. at a reduced manual labeling cost.,True,x_0MCH4AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,13,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5786759/file/5786768.pdf,17992279006342342727,/scholar?cites=17992279006342342727,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5786759/file/5786768.pdf,0,0,0

We propose a 4-step approach to solve this. First. a classifier is trained to determine whether a Twitter user is likely to post tweets about newsworthy stories. Second. tweets posted by these users during the time interval of interest are clustered into topics. For this clustering. the cosine similarity between a boosted tf-idf representation of the tweets is used. Third. we use a classifier to estimate the confidence that the obtained topics are newsworthy.

The amount of manual labeling can be significantly reduced by applying distant supervision. which generates training data by aligning large text corpora with existing knowledge bases. This typically results in a highly noisy training set. where many training sentences do not express the intended relation. In this paper. we propose to combine distant supervision with minimal human supervision by annotating features (in particular shortest dependency paths) rather than complete relation instances. Such feature labeling eliminates noise from the initial training set. resulting in a significant increase of precision at the expense of recall.

Unlike P-25 TiO2. nonporous. nanoscale TiO2 catalysts are composed mainly of mesopores with pore sizes in the range of 35–44 nm.

Catalysts treated at such a temperature display relatively low activity. Results of competitive adsorption of water and toluene on TiO2 samples confirm that TiO2 has a highly hydrophilic surface. which intrinsically suppresses the oxidation rate of toluene at high water content in the feed stream. Severe deactivation of TiO2 catalysts is due to the accumulation of partially oxidized intermediates. such as benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. on active sites.

Herein. we review various aspects of this technology including chemical reactions. physiochemical conditions and photocatalyst types such as metal oxides. sulfides. nitrides. nanocomposites. and doped materials followed by recent advances in computational modeling of photoactive materials. As the best-known catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution. TiO 2 is discussed in a separate section. along with its challenges such as the wide band gap. large overpotential for hydrogen evolution. and rapid recombination of produced electron-hole pairs. Various approaches are addressed to overcome these shortcomings. such as doping with different elements. heterojunction catalysts. noble metal deposition. and surface modification. Development of a photocatalytic corrosion resistant. visible light absorbing. defect-tuned material with small particle size is the key to complete the sunlight to hydrogen cycle efficiently. Computational studies have opened new avenues to understand and predict the electronic density of states and band structure of advanced materials and could pave the way for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. Future directions are focused on developing innovative junction architectures. novel synthesis methods and optimizing the existing active materials to enhance charge transfer. visible light absorption. reducing the gas evolution overpotential and maintaining chemical and physical stability.

Here we show that the chiral d-ribityl phosphate chain of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) induces a right-handed helix that enriches the left-handed SWNTs for all suspended (n.m) species. Such enantioselectivity stems from the sp3 hybridization of the N atom anchoring the sugar moiety to the flavin ring. This produces two FMN conformations (syn and anti) analogous to DNA. Electrostatic interactions between the neighboring uracil moiety and the 2′-OH group of the side chain provide greater stability to the anti-FMN conformation that leads to a right-handed FMN helix. The right-handed twist that the FMN helix imposes to the underlying nanotube. similar to “Indian burn”. causes diameter dilation of only the left-handed SWNTs. whose improved …,True,QJyJmDQAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,32,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja305250g,5954515790359787060,/scholar?cites=5954515790359787060,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3476938/,0,0,0

CO2 is more strongly adsorbed and also diffuses faster compared to methane and nitrogen in a carbon-based adsorbent. Hence such adsorbents are suitable for methane recovery. Carbon molecular sieve adsorbents were employed for testing the technical feasibility of the adsorption process.

A three-dimensionally porous composite consisting of eggplant-CDs and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was first synthesized via one-pot hydrothermal process. The as-synthesized RGO/CD hybrid was further deoxygenated with HI acid to enhance ionic conductivity and introduce iodine dopants in the structure. The I-doped graphene/CD composite exhibited specific capacitances of 432 and 460 F g⁻¹ at 2 mV s⁻¹ and 1 A g⁻¹ with excellent capacitance retention of 68.4% and 76.5%. as the scan rate and current density increased from 2 to 1000 mV s⁻¹ and from 1 to 100 A g⁻¹. respectively. Superior cycling stability of 94.6% capacitance retention over 10 000 cycles at 10 A g⁻¹ was measured. As an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M KOH. the composite demonstrated an onset potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE and a kinetic limiting current density of 19.8 mA cm⁻² at 0.1 V vs. RHE with an average electron transfer number of 3.57.

However. in some conditions. for highly viscous fluids. the transition from supercritical to subcritical flow occurs with non-circular shapes such as polygons. Indeed. a quick rotational wave appears on the circular jump before the formation of a polygonal form. which may be related to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. In this paper. stable polygonal jumps are studied to complete this research. The region of stability is defined for polygonal jumps. and the dependence of this region on the flow governing dimensionless groups is determined experimentally. The results confirm the multistability (hysteresis) of the polygonal jumps. and imply that polygonal jumps with different corner numbers can be created in a certain parameter regime.

Internal heat transfer which is caused by phase change is strongly irreversible and has unwanted effects on turbine efficiency. Also. the strike of formed droplets on the surfaces results in large amounts of mechanical damages. Condensation heat release to supersonic flow is named condensation shock and leads to a considerable pressure rise which in turn reduces the outlet velocity and occasionally causes severe oscillations and makes the flow supercritical.

Furthermore. obtained aerodynamic results have been used in order to analyze the trajectories of the projectiles dynamically. The considered pellets have the same caliber of 4.5mm. but different nose shapes. The first pellet is a wadcutter. while the two other ones are a sharp pointed and a domed head respectively. These pellets have been geometrically simulated by means of a precise photography and a digitizer software application for the accurate determination of the plots and grid generation purposes. The aerodynamic results contain the streamlines. drag and pressure coefficients as well as pressure and Mach contours. These results demonstrate how drag coefficient changes versus the Mach number of the free stream flow which is a key point for the governing equations of the projectile motion. Dynamic results. which consist of trajectory and the Mach reduction diagrams of the pellets in various Mach numbers. have been acquired and compared in various Mach numbers. Relying on these analyses. from both aerodynamic and dynamic points of view. the third pellet in a variety range of Mach numbers is the most dominant projectile; however. the selection of superior pellet between the first and the second one strongly depends on considered Mach numbers at which the pellet travels its effective range of fly.

1213193,Entropy generation analysis for film boiling: A simple model of quenching,2016,Ali Lotfi and Esmail Lakzian,131,The European Physical Journal Plus,4,1-10,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,In this paper. quenching in high-temperature materials processing is modeled as a superheated isothermal flat plate. In these phenomena. a liquid flows over the highly superheated surfaces for cooling. So the surface and the liquid are separated by the vapor layer that is formed because of the liquid which is in contact with the superheated surface. This is named forced film boiling. As an objective. the distribution of the entropy generation in the laminar forced film boiling is obtained by similarity solution for the first time in the quenching processes. The PDE governing differential equations of the laminar film boiling including continuity. momentum. and energy are reduced to ODE ones. and a dimensionless equation for entropy generation inside the liquid boundary and vapor layer is obtained.

The model is an extension of one developed by Bussmann et al. [Phys.

Surface tension is modeled as a volume force acting on fluid near the free surface. Contact angles are applied as a boundary condition at liquid–solid contact lines. The energy equations in both the liquid and solid portions of the droplet are solved using the Enthalpy method. Heat transfer within the substrate is by conduction alone.

Initial substrate temperatures were varied from 50°C to 120°C (low enough to prevent boiling in the drop) and impact velocities from 0.5 to 4 m/s.

Numerical calculations of droplet shape and substrate temperature during impact agreed well with experimental results. Both simulations and experiments show that increasing impact velocity enhances heat flux from the substrate by only a small amount. The principal effect of raising droplet velocity is that it makes the droplet spread more during impact. increasing the wetted area across which heat transfer takes place.

Based on an exergy analysis. a computer program has been developed to investigate improving the performance of an ABC cycle by calculating the irreversibility in the corresponding devices of the system. In this study. we suggest two new cycles where an air bottoming cycle along with the steam injection are used.

Velocity fields associated to the free surface vortex were obtained at three horizontal planes and four Reynolds numbers. i.e. between 2400 and 11.000 (calculated with reference to the exit hole diameter and the mean exit velocity). Due to the unsteady behavior of the flow field. the vortex center positions have been identified and the vortex paths were reconstructed for all experiments. Average velocity fields have been calculated by aligning the vortex centers at each frame. in order to derive radial and tangential velocity profiles. to be compared at different Reynolds numbers and measurement planes. The results show that the radial motion assumes a potential behavior when it is near the exit hole. scaling quite well with the average exit velocity (thus with the corresponding Reynolds number).

The treatment of both neutron scattering in graphite and resonance capture are complex and not adequately captured using the methods traditionally used in High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGR) and commonly used in Light Water Reactors (LWR). For transient analysis. temperature feedback is a function of the TRISO fuel form. but full core models cannot resolve phenomena at this scale without averaging over space and energy.

Equilibrium moments in moment space are derived from an incompressible BGKLB method. The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations can be recovered through the Chapman-Enskog multi-scale expansion without artificial compressible effects. To compare the performance of proposed model. several benchmark problems (such as a cubic lid-driven cavity flow. flow over a backward-facing step. and a double shear flow) are solved and the results are compared with those of both 19-bit Incompressible BGK Lattice Boltzmann (IBGKLB) method and existing CFD simulations. It is shown that the stability and accuracy of the 19-bit IGLB method is better than those of the 19-bit IBGKLB method; in fact with the IGLB model we can increase the Reynolds number by factor of 2.5 and still get stable results. The proposed 3-D IGLB method is successfully expanded and applied to simulation of the 3-D incompressible buoyancy driven flows. The results of the 3-D steady-state natural convection in an air-filled differentially heated cubic cavity obtained by the extended model comply well with the existing data in literature.

In this work. a compressible LBM in conjunction with the explicit Taylor-series expansion and least squares-based lattice Boltzmann method (TLLBM) is used to simulate two-dimensional microflows.

Monash University. Malaysia. CF THAN. Monash University. Malaysia. YW OOI. Monash University. Malaysia. The ability of the Kenics static mixer. a commercially available mixer that does not involve the use of mechanical agitation. in mixing of two immiscible liquids has been investigated. The model object is a length of pipe containing the Kenics static mixer elements each resembling a short helix. The two modeled phases were palm oil triglyceride in the continuous phase and methanol in the discrete phase. This process mimics the pre-mixing process before the transesterification process which takes place in the biodiesel production. The flow field was simulated numerically using the commercially available Computational Fluid Dynamics software package. Fluent. In the preprocessing phase. the modeling of the model object incorporated both tetrahedral and hexahedral meshing schemes to discretize the model geometry. Solving the flow fields involved choosing the appropriate models. These included choosing between the various laminar and turbulent models. an appropriate multiphase model as well as an appropriate drop breakage model. Postprocessing was concerned with extracting relevant information from the flow field to evaluate the performance of the Kenics static mixer and involved assessing its effectiveness in mixing the two fluids by statistical means and estimating the pressure drop across the mixer. Simulated data predicted that the Kenics mixer with an RL (successive elements were installed with an alternate twist) configuration is the most effective static mixer.

The cavity is filled with TiO2-water nanofluid and is get under a uniform magnetic field at different angles with respect to horizontal plane. The proposed numerical scheme is solved the flow field and the temperature field using MRT-D2Q9 and MRT-D2Q5 lattice model. respectively. So. the main objective of this work is to show the effectiveness of this model to predict the effects of pertinent parameters such as the Rayleigh number (103< Ra< 107). the solid volume fraction (0%< φ< 5%). the Hartmann number (0< Ha< 60) and the magnetic field angle (0<< 90) on the flow field and temperature field and the heat transfer performance of the cavity. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method is a powerful approach to simulate the MHD natural convection of nanofluids in a square cavity. Also the numerical results show that for Ra= 105 and for the range of Hartmann number of this study. the heat transfer and fluid flow depend strongly upon the direction of magnetic field.

Multi-reference frame (MRF) methods and k-å turbulence model were used to solve turbulent flow equations. It was found that turbulent flow field in reactor is non-homogenous. This non-homogeneity is especially common among three compartments of a reactor based on turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate. A compartment around the impeller with very high rate of TKE dissipation (impeller zone). a compartment around the baffles with a relatively high rate of TKE dissipation (baffle zone) and a relatively big compartment in bulk of flow with low TKE dissipation rate (circulation flow). Therefore a three-compartment model was used to explain the non-homogeneity of turbulent flow field. The parameters of this model are compartment volume ratios (m i and m b). compartment energy dissipation ratios (l b and l i) and exchange flow rates (Q i and Q b). which were obtained from simulations for different agitation rates.,True,sic9CMAAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,2,https://www.sid.ir/en/journal/ViewPaper.aspx?id=271340,11022981338162503422,/scholar?cites=11022981338162503422,,https://www.sid.ir/EN/VEWSSID/J_pdf/102420120205.pdf,0,0,0

1213350,Thermal conductivity of nanoparticles filled polymers,2012,Hassan Ebadi-Dehaghani and Mehra Nazempour,,,,,InTech,Thermal conductivity of polymers is an important thermal property for both polymer applications and processing. Polymers typically have intrinsic thermal conductivity much lower than those for metals or ceramic materials. and therefore are good thermal insulators. Further enhancement of this thermal insulating quality can be achieved by foaming polymers. In other applications which require higher thermal conductivity. such as in electronic packaging and encapsulations. satellite devices. and in areas where good heat dissipation. low thermal expansion and light weight are needed. polymers reinforced with fillers. organic or inorganic. are becoming more and more common in producing advanced polymer composites for these applications (Hodgin & Estes. 1999; Tavman. 2004; Lee & Eun. 2004; Liu & Mather. 2004; Ishida & Heights. 1999; Frank & Phillip. 2002; Hermansen. 2001; Ishida. 2000). Most polymeric materials are processed and fabricated at elevated temperatures. often above their melting temperatures. This process may be long and expensive because of the low thermal conductivity of polymers.

The standard method for natural gas dehydration is absorption of water using triethylene glycol (TEG). TEG is used in about 95% of the glycol dehydration units for natural gas streams. Glycol dehydration units conventionally consist of a contactor. and a regenerator. An alternate approach for the enhancement of stripping column performance is the use of stripping agent. In this approach a volatile hydrocarbon liquid is added into the glycol regeneration system instead of stripping gas. Reduction of TEG loss and its regeneration is one of the most important processes in gas refinery industry because it is an expensive chemical component.

The objective of this experimental study is to discuss production. stability and thermal conductivity examination of water/graphene oxide nanofluid considered as a new nanofluid used in machining process instead of common coolant. In this research. for thermal conductivity enhancement of a basic fluid (Deionized water). a nanofluid development method composed of two steps as well as particles of nano dimension consisting water/graphene oxide is used. Producing 16 different nanofluid samples. the sample having a higher stability than others is considered for examining the thermal conductivity. The Zeta potential measurement is used in order to precisely determine stability of the final sample of water/graphene oxide nanofluid. Considering the obtained results. a highly acceptable level of stability is concluded.

1213432,Thermal conductivity of nanoparticles filled polymers,2012,Hassan Ebadi-Dehaghani and Monireh Nazempour,,,,,INTECH Open Access Publisher,Thermal conductivity of polymers is an important thermal property for both polymer applications and processing. Polymers typically have intrinsic thermal conductivity much lower than those for metals or ceramic materials. and therefore are good thermal insulators. Further enhancement of this thermal insulating quality can be achieved by foaming polymers. In other applications which require higher thermal conductivity. such as in electronic packaging and encapsulations. satellite devices. and in areas where good heat dissipation. low thermal expansion and light weight are needed. polymers reinforced with fillers. organic or inorganic. are becoming more and more common in producing advanced polymer composites for these applications (Hodgin & Estes. 1999; Tavman. 2004; Lee & Eun. 2004; Liu & Mather. 2004; Ishida & Heights. 1999; Frank & Phillip. 2002; Hermansen. 2001; Ishida. 2000). Most polymeric materials are processed and fabricated at elevated temperatures. often above their melting temperatures. This process may be long and expensive because of the low thermal conductivity of polymers. Subsequently. the cooling process or annealing may also be controlled by heat transport properties of polymers. which eventually affect the physical properties of the materials. One example is crystalline polymers. for which the structural and morphological features may be significantly changed with the speed of cooling.

Effect of blend composition on oxygen permeability through compression molded films was investigated and correlated to the microstructure. Two blends. PP-rich (75/25) and PLA-rich (25/75). were selected in order to consider the effect of incorporation of clay and compatibilization on the permeability. The PP-rich blends had greater oxygen barrier properties compared to those of PLA-rich blends. Several proposed models of permeability for blends and nanocomposites were examined. These models failed to predict the permeability values. especially for PLA-rich blends. The failure was attributed to the immiscibility issue leading to appearance of microvoids at the interface.

Then a minimum length scale is determined such that the hydrodynamic behavior based on standard DPD formulation is modeled correctly. Almost all of the previous studies assume the DPD particles as point centers of repulsion with no intrinsic size. Hence to prescribe the size of a simulating sphere. a structure of frozen DPD particles is created. In this paper two effective radii. Stokes-Einstein radius and a radius based on the Stokes law. for DPD particles are introduced. For small Reynolds numbers; it is proved that the two radii approach each other. Finally in spite of the typical simulations which assume DPD particles as point centers of repulsion. it is concluded that each of the individual DPD particles interact with other particles as a sphere with non-zero radius. It results the reduction of the required number of particles and eventuates more economical simulations.

Thesurfactants are modeled with special chemical structure and bending stiffness. To confirm that the novel model is physical. we determine the interaction parameters based on matching the compressibility and solubility of the DPD system with real physics of the fluid. To match the mutual solubility for binary fluids. we use the relation between DPD parameters and -parameters in Flory-Huggins-type models. Unsaturated bonds can change the stiffness of a lipid membrane which is modeled by introducing a bond bending potential. To verify our model we investigate the effect of surfactant structure like chain length and stiffness of those molecules on the properties of the modeled membrane as area per surfactant. To validate our results. we also compare them with the theoretical calculations as well as with the experimental and other existing simulations results.

1213474,Deformable bubbles in a free shear layer,1997,E Loth and M Taeibi-Rahni and G Tryggvason,23,International journal of multiphase flow,5,977-1001,Pergamon,The flow in and around three-dimensional deformable bubbles subjected to a non-linear planar free shear layer was simulated using a finite difference/front tracking scheme with the full Navier-Stokes equations including surface tension. This allowed detailed resolution of the flow around and inside the bubble. The bubble size and response time is comparable to the thickness and timescale of the free shear layer and we have investigated increased deformation by systematically lowering surface tension. The interaction between the bubble wake and the shear layer led to complex three-dimensional flows past and within the bubble surface. The resulting hydrodynamic forces and trajectories of the fully resolved bubble simulation could be qualitatively compared with those expected from quasi-steady classical predictions. In general. the quasi-steady drag began to underpredict the actual drag as deformation …,True,Op7G8YoAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301932297000256,7609715830596568395,/scholar?cites=7609715830596568395,,,0,0,0

This choice warrants to reduce the nonlinearities arose in treating the system of conservative equations. The use of a new Favre-averaging like technique plays a key role to render this benefit.

The role of large bubbles in modifying low Reynolds number (∼ 250) shear flow structures is investigated. specifically for bubbles whose diameter approaches the scale of the largest liquid eddies. The results indicate that duration of eddy crossing is the main mechanism for flow modulation. which is typically characterized by decreased vortex coherency and size. modified fluctuation statistics and significant variations in pairing/merging phenomena.

A Wiley Company,An attempt was made to introduce a new approach for evaluating mass transfer during drop formation via definition of a parameter related to the extent of the convective mixing within the growing drop. For this purpose it was assumed that the entrance of the dispersed flow into the growing drop from the nozzle is analogous to the entrance of the flow from a smaller channel to a larger one. This transfer mechanism has been dubbed the “flow expansion.” A global time‐dependent Reynolds number of growing drop (Regd) was defined based on the equivalent diameter of growing drop as a length scale and also on a velocity scale. which is obtained using this flow expansion assumption. The results show that (Regd) has an important role on the mass transfer coefficient.

Various styles of gold mineralization occur throughout the range. Mineralization at Gandy occurs in close spatial relation with rhyolitic domes in a caldera setting in a series of narrow brecciated veins. Two mineralogically and spatially different argillic alterations have affected the volcano-sedimentary host unit. The first is a pervasive advanced argillic alteration (kaolinite+ quartz) and the other is a vein-controlled quartz with illite assemblage. Ore minerals comprise gold. silver. base metal sulfides and sulfosalt minerals are accompanied by carbonates. quartz and barite. Fluid inclusions in coarse-grained sphalerite have homogenization temperatures ranging from 139 to 345 C and salinities from 7.9 to 16 wt% NaCl equiv. Data suggest that the main ore deposition mechanism is the mixing of a< 200 C and moderately low-salinity fluid resulting from condensation of magmatic volatiles in ground water with a> 300 C magmatic fluid. Mineralization at Gandy is the product of ascending gas and saline fluid exsolved from crystallizing magma. possibly due to transition from plastic into brittle regime resulting from emplacement of the rhyolitic intrusion. consequent condensation in ground water and mixing. Characteristics of the Gandy deposit are similar to those of gold and base metal-rich epithermal deposits of intermediate-sulfidation state.,True,xCIN_MgAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,18,https://www.sid.ir/en/journal/ViewPaper.aspx?id=52238,2428952229578329442,/scholar?cites=2428952229578329442,,https://www.sid.ir/en/VEWSSID/J_pdf/97320060404.pdf,0,0,0

The intrinsic difference between fuel cells (electrochemical systems) and heat engines (combustion engines) efficiencies is a fundamental one with regard to the conversion of chemical energy of reactions into electrical work.

1213635,Enhanced Casting Procedure to Improve Casting Yield and to Reduce Radioactive Wastes,2018,Seoung Woo Kuk and Sung Chan Park and Young Mo Ko and Jeong-Yong Park,,KNS,,,,The injection casting procedure is one of the most promising procedures used to fabricate fuel slugs for fast reactors [1-2]. U-Zr based alloys are investigated to improve the safety and economy of the metallic fuel system. It is appropriate for recycled fuel to improve the thermal conductivity. Therefore. it is necessary to investigate Rare-Earths (REs) including U-Zr alloys. to research surrogates of recycled fuel ingots. The RE including U-Zr alloys are highly reactive to interact with a crucible during casting. Therefore. casting crucibles were coated using yttrium oxide to prevent interactions between a crucible and the coating layer. However. the coating layer of previous research was easily damaged and detached during heating [3]. In this research. enhanced U-Zr-RE fuel slug fabrication systems were investigated to demonstrate contamination during casting. The casting chamber and crucibles were degassed using a diffusion pump of the casting machine. The degassing time and temperature were controlled to improve the inert air condition of the chamber. Ar gas was charged in the chamber to prevent oxidation of the material during heating. Microstructures at the edge of the melt-residue were analyzed to verify the improved casting condition system. Control of the casting condition can be used not only to protect the crucible coating layers. but also to prevent the RE oxidation effects during heating by the engineering and technical development of the system.

Herein. we demonstrate the inhibition of photoconversion activity in ZnO-graphene core-shell quantum dots (QD)(ZGQDs) agglomerated by 4-aminophenol (4-AP) used as a linker. The ZnO-graphene quantum dots (QD) aggregates (ZGAs) were synthesized using a facile solvothermal process. The ZGAs revealed an increased absorbance in the wavelengths between 350 and 750 nm as compared with the ZGQDs. Against expectation. the calculated average photoluminescence lifetime of ZGAs was 7.37 ns. which was 4.65 ns longer than that of ZGQDs and was mainly due to the high contribution of a slow (τ 2. τ 3) component by trapped carriers in the functional groups of graphene shells and 4-AP. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells and photodetectors (PDs) were fabricated to investigate the influence of ZGAs on the photoconversion activity. The photocurrent density of PEC cells with ZGAs was obtained as 0.04 mA/cm 2 at 0.6 V. which was approximately 3.25 times lower than that of the ZGQDs. The rate constant value of the photodegradation value of rhodamine B was also decreased by around 1.4 times. Furthermore. the photoresponsivity of the PDs with ZGAs (1.54 μA· mW− 1) was about 2.5 times as low as that of the PDs with ZGQDs (3.85 μA· mW− 1). Consequently. it suggests that the device performances could be degraded by the inhibition phenomenon of the photoconversion activity in the ZGAs due to an increase of trap sites.

The conjugation of the ZnO QDs to the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). the graphene to the ZnO QDs and the fullerene (C60) to the ZnO QDs led to PL quenching of about 80%. 65% and 98%. respectively. which can be attributed to the efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons from the ZnO QDs to the MWCNT. from the ZnO QDs to the C60 or from the ZnO QDs to the graphene through Zn–O–C chemical bonding.,True,mNsPyUgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,3,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asp/jnn/2016/00000016/00000011/art00172,7734639954904303018,/scholar?cites=7734639954904303018,,,0,0,0
1213687,Inhibition of Photoconversion Activity in Self-Assembled ZnO-Graphene Quantum Dots Aggregated by 4-Aminophenol Used as a Linker,2020,Kyu Seung Lee and Young Jae Park and Jaeho Shim and Guh-Hwan Lim and Sang-Youp Yim and Jin Won Seo and Jae Hyoung Ryu and Dong Ick Son,25,Molecules,12,2802,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The aggregation of zinc oxide nanoparticles leads to an increased absorbance in the ultraviolet-visible region by an induced light scattering effect. Herein. we demonstrate the inhibition of photoconversion activity in ZnO-graphene core-shell quantum dots (QD)(ZGQDs) agglomerated by 4-aminophenol (4-AP) used as a linker. The ZnO-graphene quantum dots (QD) aggregates (ZGAs) were synthesized using a facile solvothermal process. The ZGAs revealed an increased absorbance in the wavelengths between 350 and 750 nm as compared with the ZGQDs. Against expectation. the calculated average photoluminescence lifetime of ZGAs was 7.37 ns. which was 4.65 ns longer than that of ZGQDs and was mainly due to the high contribution of a slow (τ 2. τ 3) component by trapped carriers in the functional groups of graphene shells and 4-AP. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells and photodetectors (PDs) were fabricated to investigate the influence of ZGAs on the photoconversion activity. The photocurrent density of PEC cells with ZGAs was obtained as 0.04 mA/cm 2 at 0.6 V. which was approximately 3.25 times lower than that of the ZGQDs. The rate constant value of the photodegradation value of rhodamine B was also decreased by around 1.4 times. Furthermore. the photoresponsivity of the PDs with ZGAs (1.54 μA· mW− 1) was about 2.5 times as low as that of the PDs with ZGQDs (3.85 μA· mW− 1). Consequently. it suggests that the device performances could be degraded by the inhibition phenomenon of the photoconversion activity in the ZGAs due to an increase of trap sites.

Compared to other recent reports. a much lower growth temperature of 400 °C is required for this procedure. The chemical vapor deposition of MoS2 on the graphene surface gives rise to single crystalline hexagonal flakes with a typical lateral size ranging from several hundred nanometers to several micrometers. The precursor (ammonium thiomolybdate) together with solvent was transported to graphene surface by a carrier gas at room temperature. which was then followed by post annealing. At an elevated temperature. the precursor self-assembles to form MoS2 flakes epitaxially on the graphene surface via thermal decomposition.

The van Hove singularity transitions (E11S. E22S.

The work function was downshifted up to 0.42 eV by a strong charge transfer from the SWCNTs to AuCl3 by a high level of p-doping. We propose that this large work function shift forces the Fermi level of the SWCNTs to be located deep in the valence band. i.e.. highly degenerate. creating empty van Hove singularity states. and hence the work function shift invokes a new asymmetric transition in the absorption spectroscopy from a deeper level to newly generated empty states.,True,6U3tdAYAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,234,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja8038689,8633042574302559818,/scholar?cites=8633042574302559818,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47550098/Fermi_level_engineering_of_single-walled20160726-9879-1q2lmf4.pdf,0,0,0
