1274599,Data clustering: a review,1999,Anil K Jain and M Narasimha Murty and Patrick J Flynn,31,ACM computing surveys (CSUR),3,264-323,Acm,Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns (observations. data items. or feature vectors) into groups (clusters). The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However. clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially. and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective. with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques. and identify  cross-cutting themes and recent advances.

1274601,Statistical pattern recognition: a review,2000,Anil K Jain and Robert PW Duin and Jianchang Mao,1,"IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, PAMI-22",,4-37,,The primary goal of pattern recognition is supervised or unsupervised classification. Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated. the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently. neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes. sensing environment. pattern representation. feature extraction and selection. cluster analysis. classifier design and learning. selection of training and test samples. and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field. the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation. location. and scale remains unsolved.

1274602,Data clustering: 50 years beyond K-means,2010,Anil K Jain,31,Pattern recognition letters,8,651-666,North-Holland,Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example. a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain. kingdom. phylum. class. etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping. or clustering. objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers. i.e.. class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields.

1274610,Self-organizing maps,2012,Teuvo Kohonen,30,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Since the second edition of this book came out in early 1997. the number of scientific papers published on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) has increased from about 1500 to some 4000. Also. two special workshops dedicated to the SOM have been organized. not to mention numerous SOM sessions in neural network conferences. In view of this growing interest it was felt desirable to make extensive revisions to this book. They are of the following nature. Statistical pattern analysis has now been approached more carefully than earlier. A more detailed discussion of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of symmetric matrices. which are the type usually encountered in statistics. has been included in Sect. 1.1. 3: also. new probabilistic concepts. such as factor analysis. have been discussed in Sect. 1.3. 1. A survey of projection methods (Sect. 1.3. 2) has been added. in order to relate the SOM to classical paradigms. Vector Quantization is now discussed in one main section. and derivation of the point density of the codebook vectors using the calculus of variations has been added. in order to familiarize the reader with this otherwise com plicated statistical analysis. It was also felt that the discussion of the neural-modeling philosophy should include a broader perspective of the main issues. A historical review in Sect. 2.2. and the general philosophy in Sects. 2.3. 2.5 and 2.14 are now expected to especially help newcomers to orient themselves better amongst the profusion of contemporary neural models.,True,rGF6-WkAAAAJ:tai-Ft5GzhwC,36305,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=M-zxCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:gpokrRnaLWEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Pn6zsNEIxl&sig=NVHGNPCm4PRCLvSHWB-XEpdqYpM,7002492799444884098,/scholar?cites=7002492799444884098,,,http://www.cis.hut.fi/research/reports/quinquennial/ch1.ps,0,0,0
1274611,Image super-resolution via sparse representation,2010,Jianchao Yang and John Wright and Thomas S Huang and Yi Ma,19,IEEE transactions on image processing,11,2861-2873,IEEE,This paper presents a new approach to single-image superresolution. based upon sparse signal representation. Research on image statistics suggests that image patches can be well-represented as a sparse linear combination of elements from an appropriately chosen over-complete dictionary. Inspired by this observation. we seek a sparse representation for each patch of the low-resolution input. and then use the coefficients of this representation to generate the high-resolution output. Theoretical results from compressed sensing suggest that under mild conditions. the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signals. By jointly training two dictionaries for the low- and high-resolution image patches. we can enforce the similarity of sparse representations between the low-resolution and high-resolution image patch pair with respect to their own dictionaries. Therefore. the sparse …,True,rGF6-WkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,4886,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5466111/,2778014145405889223,/scholar?cites=2778014145405889223,,,https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/16479/yang_jianchao.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

This paper presents a simple but effective coding scheme called Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) in place of the VQ coding in traditional SPM. LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system. and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier. the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM. achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22]. the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution.

1274614,Linear spatial pyramid matching using sparse coding for image classification,2009,Jianchao Yang and Kai Yu and Yihong Gong and Thomas Huang,,,,1794-1801,IEEE,Recently SVMs using spatial pyramid matching (SPM) kernel have been highly successful in image classification. Despite its popularity. these nonlinear SVMs have a complexity O(n 2  ~ n 3 ) in training and O(n) in testing. where n is the training size. implying that it is nontrivial to scaleup the algorithms to handle more than thousands of training images. In this paper we develop an extension of the SPM method. by generalizing vector quantization to sparse coding followed by multi-scale spatial max pooling. and propose a linear SPM kernel based on SIFT sparse codes. This new approach remarkably reduces the complexity of SVMs to O(n) in training and a constant in testing. In a number of image categorization experiments. we find that. in terms of classification accuracy. the suggested linear SPM based on sparse coding of SIFT descriptors always significantly outperforms the linear SPM kernel on histograms. and …,True,rGF6-WkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,3705,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5206757/,12120686043328243937,/scholar?cites=12120686043328243937,,,http://webia.lip6.fr/~thomen/Teaching/RDFIA/CVPR09-ScSPM.pdf,0,0,0

Many visual feature representations have been explored and many systems built. While these research efforts establish the basis of CBIR. the usefulness of the proposed approaches is limited.

1274621,Image quality assessment: from error visibility to structural similarity,2004,Zhou Wang and Alan C Bovik and Hamid R Sheikh and Eero P Simoncelli,13,IEEE transactions on image processing,4,600-612,IEEE,Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene. we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept. we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples. as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.

Bovik,9,IEEE Signal Processing Letters,3,81-84,IEEE,We propose a new universal objective image quality index. which is easy to calculate and applicable to various image processing applications. Instead of using traditional error summation methods. the proposed index is designed by modeling any image distortion as a combination of three factors: loss of correlation. luminance distortion. and contrast distortion. Although the new index is mathematically defined and no human visual system model is explicitly employed. our experiments on various image distortion types indicate that it performs significantly better than the widely used distortion metric mean squared error.

1274623,Multiscale structural similarity for image quality assessment,2003,Zhou Wang and Eero P Simoncelli and Alan C Bovik,2,,,1398-1402,IEEE,The structural similarity image quality paradigm is based on the assumption that the human visual system is highly adapted for extracting structural information from the scene. and therefore a measure of structural similarity can provide a good approximation to perceived image quality.

The message we are trying to send here is not that one should abandon use of the MSE nor to blindly switch to any other particular signal fidelity measure. Rather. we hope to make the point that there are powerful. easy-to-use. and easy-to-understand alternatives that might be deployed depending on the application environment and needs.

Current state-of-the-art “general purpose” no reference (NR) IQA algorithms require knowledge about anticipated distortions in the form of training examples and corresponding human opinion scores.

MRI intensity inhomogeneities can be attributed to imperfections in the radio-frequency coils or to problems associated with the acquisition sequences. The result is a slowly varying shading artifact over the image that can produce errors with conventional intensity-based classification. Our algorithm is formulated by modifying the objective function of the standard fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm to compensate for such inhomogeneities and to allow the labeling of a pixel (voxel) to be influenced by the labels in its immediate neighborhood.

This is a book for those learning plasma physics for the first time and could care less about the fine points.

Our variational formulation consists of an internal energy term that penalizes the deviation of the level set function from a signed distance function. and an external energy term that drives the motion of the zero level set toward the desired image features. such as object boundaries. The resulting evolution of the level set function is the gradient flow that minimizes the overall energy functional. The proposed variational level set formulation has three main advantages over the traditional level set formulations. First. a significantly larger time step can be used for numerically solving the evolution partial differential equation. and therefore speeds up the curve evolution.

The motivation for regularizing with the TV norm is that it is extremely effective for recovering edges of images as well as some blurring functions. e.g.. motion blur and out-of-focus blur. An alternating minimization (AM) implicit iterative scheme is devised to recover the image and simultaneously identify the point spread function (PSF). Numerical results indicate that the iterative scheme is quite robust. converges very fast (especially for discontinuous blur). and both the image and the PSF can be recovered under the presence of high noise level.

MICs of colistin against A. baumannii indicate its significant activity. However. resistance to colistin in A. baumannii has been reported recently. Clonotypes of 16 clinical A. baumannii isolates and ATCC 19606 were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). and colistin MICs were measured. The time-kill kinetics of colistin against A. baumannii ATCC 19606 and clinical isolate 6 were investigated. and population analysis profiles (PAPs) were conducted. Resistance development was investigated by serial passaging with or without exposure to colistin. Five different PFGE banding patterns were found in the clinical isolates. MICs of colistin against all isolates were within 0.25 to 2 μg/ml. Colistin showed early concentration-dependent killing. but …,True,L1if3T8AAAAJ:xj5OetCc6CwC,611,https://aac.asm.org/content/50/9/2946.short,12667915983916631047,/scholar?cites=12667915983916631047,,,https://aac.asm.org/content/aac/50/9/2946.full.pdf,0,0,0

Within the context of this cosmology. the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination. the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter. and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be θ∗ = (1.04147 ± 0.00062) × 10-2.

Neighborhoods of coefficients at adjacent positions and scales are modeled as the product of two independent random variables: a Gaussian vector and a hidden positive scalar multiplier. The latter modulates the local variance of the coefficients in the neighborhood. and is thus able to account for the empirically observed correlation between the coefficient amplitudes. Under this model. the Bayesian least squares estimate of each coefficient reduces to a weighted average of the local linear estimates over all possible values of the hidden multiplier variable.

The model is parameterized by a set of statistics computed on pairs of coefficients corresponding to basis functions at adjacent spatial locations. orientations. and scales. We develop an efficient algorithm for synthesizing random images subject to these constraints. by iteratively projecting onto the set of images satisfying each constraint. and we use this to test the perceptual validity of the model. In particular. we demonstrate the necessity of subgroups of the parameter set by showing examples of texture synthesis that fail when those parameters are removed from the set.

1274681,Shiftable multiscale transforms,1992,Eero P Simoncelli and William T Freeman and Edward H Adelson and David J Heeger,38,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,2,587-607,IEEE,One of the major drawbacks of orthogonal wavelet transforms is their lack of translation invariance: the content of wavelet subbands is unstable under translations of the input signal. Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal and. in two dimensions. rotations of the input signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. In the spatial domain. shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus. the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains. particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale. and a 2-D …,True,MplR7_cAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1912,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/119725/,14714856519668394037,/scholar?cites=14714856519668394037,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA508206.pdf,0,0,0

1274690,A two-bit differentiated services architecture for the Internet,1999,Kathleen Nichols and Van Jacobson and Lixia Zhang,,,,,RFC 2638. July,This document presents a differentiated services architecture for the internet. Dave Clark and Van Jacobson each presented work on differentiated services at the Munich IETF meeting [2. 3]. Each explained how to use one bit of the IP header to deliver a new kind of service to packets in the internet. These were two very different kinds of service with quite different policy assumptions. Ensuing discussion has convinced us that both service types have merit and that both service types can be implemented with a set of very similar mechanisms. 2 We propose an architectural framework that permits the use of both of these service types and exploits their similarities in forwarding path mechanisms. The major goals of this architecture are each shared with one or both of those two proposals: keep the forwarding path simple. push complexity to the edges of the network to the extent possible. provide a service that avoids assumptions about the type of traffic using it. employ an allocation policy that will be compatible with both long-term and short-term provisioning. make it possible for the dominant Internet traffic model to remain best-effort.The major contributions of this document are to present two distinct service types. a set of general mechanisms for the forwarding path that can be used to implement a range of differentiated services and to propose a flexible framework for provisioning a differentiated services network. It is precisely this kind of architecture that is needed for expedient deployment of differentiated services: we need a framework and set of primitives that can be implemented in the short-term and provide interoperable services. yet can provide …,True,M2dHb-4AAAAJ:vgb0g4rEShEC,1382,https://ee.lbl.gov/papers/2bitarch.pdf,15972583956307004542,/scholar?cites=15972583956307004542,,,https://ee.lbl.gov/papers/2bitarch.pdf,0,0,0

1274704,Digital step edges from zero crossing of second directional derivatives,1987,Robert M Haralick,,,,216-226,Morgan Kaufmann,–We use the facet model to accomplish step edge detection. The essence of the facet model is that any analysis made on the basis of the pixel values in some neighborhood has its final authoritative interpretation relative to the underlying gray tone intensity surface of which the neighborhood pixel values are observed noisy samples. With regard to edge detection. we define an edge to occur in a pixel if and only if there is some point in the pixel's area having a negatively sloped zero crossing of the second directional derivative taken in the direction of a nonzero gradient at the pixel's center. Thus. to determine whether or not a pixel should be marked as a step edge pixel. its underlying gray tone intensity surface must be estimated on the basis of the pixels in its neighborhood.

As opposed to PCA. 2DPCA is based on 2D image matrices rather than 1D vectors so the image matrix does not need to be transformed into a vector prior to feature extraction. Instead. an image covariance matrix is constructed directly using the original image matrices. and its eigenvectors are derived for image feature extraction. To test 2DPCA and evaluate its performance. a series of experiments were performed on three face image databases: ORL. AR. and Yale face databases. The recognition rate across all trials was higher using 2DPCA than PCA.

The well-known structural similarity index brings IQA from pixel- to structure-based stage.

Considering that PC is contrast invariant while the contrast information does affect HVS' perception of image quality. the image gradient magnitude (GM) is employed as the secondary feature in FSIM.

A local region is represented by its center pixel and a local difference sign-magnitude transform (LDSMT). The center pixels represent the image gray level and they are converted into a binary code. namely CLBP-Center (CLBP_C). by global thresholding. LDSMT decomposes the image local differences into two complementary components: the signs and the magnitudes. and two operators. namely CLBP-Sign (CLBP_S) and CLBP-Magnitude (CLBP_M). are proposed to code them.

1274724,Contrast-based image attention analysis by using fuzzy growing,2003,Yu-Fei Ma and Hong-Jiang Zhang,,,,374-381,ACM,Visual attention analysis provides an alternative methodology to semantic image understanding in many applications such as adaptive content delivery and region-based image retrieval. In this paper. we propose a feasible and fast approach to attention area detection in images based on contrast analysis. The main contributions are threefold: 1) a new saliency map generation method based on local contrast analysis is proposed; 2) by simulating human perception. a fuzzy growing method is used to extract attended areas or objects from the saliency map; and 3) a practicable framework for image attention analysis is presented. which provides three-level attention analysis. ie. attended view. attended areas and attended points. This framework facilitates visual analysis tools or vision systems to automatically extract attentions from images in a manner like human perception.

Using binary Bayesian classifiers. we attempt to capture high-level concepts from low-level image features under the constraint that the test image does belong to one of the classes. Specifically. we consider the hierarchical classification of vacation images; at the highest level. images are classified as indoor or outdoor; outdoor images are further classified as city or landscape; finally. a subset of landscape images is classified into sunset. forest. and mountain classes. We demonstrate that a small vector quantizer (whose optimal size is selected using a modified MDL criterion) can be used to model the class-conditional densities of the features. required by the Bayesian methodology.

An objective function is defined to impose a localization constraint. in addition to the non-negativity constraint in the standard NMF. This gives a set of bases which not only allows a non-subtractive (part-based) representation of images but also manifests localized features. An algorithm is presented for the learning of such basic components. Experimental results are presented to compare LNMF with the NMF and PCA methods for face representation and recognition. which demonstrates advantages of LNMF.,True,u6wmNbQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/990477/,2906870774698379415,/scholar?cites=2906870774698379415,,,http://www.ai.mit.edu/courses/6.899/papers/3B_04.PDF,0,0,0

Our algorithm is based on the locality preserving projection (LPP) algorithm. which aims at finding a linear approximation to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the face manifold. However. LPP is nonorthogonal. and this makes it difficult to reconstruct the data. The orthogonal locality preserving projection (OLPP) method produces orthogonal basis functions and can have more locality preserving power than LPP. Since the locality preserving power is potentially related to the discriminating power. the OLPP is expected to have more discriminating power than LPP.

The original snake. when it is not close enough to contours. is not attracted by them and straightens to a line. Our model makes the curve behave like a balloon which is inflated by an additional force. The initial curve need no longer be close to the solution to converge.

It detects the global minimum of an active contour model’s energy between two end points. Initialization is made easier and the curve is not trapped at a local minimum by spurious edges. We modify the “snake” energy by including the internal regularization term in the external potential term. Our method is based on finding a path of minimal length in a Riemannian metric. We then make use of a new efficient numerical method to find this shortest path.It is shown that the proposed energy. though based only on a potential integrated along the curve. imposes a regularization effect like snakes.

Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene. we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept. we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples. as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.

Instead of using traditional error summation methods. the proposed index is designed by modeling any image distortion as a combination of three factors: loss of correlation. luminance distortion. and contrast distortion. Although the new index is mathematically defined and no human visual system model is explicitly employed. our experiments on various image distortion types indicate that it performs significantly better than the widely used distortion metric mean squared error.

By contrast. designing objective No-Reference (NR) quality measurement algorithms is a very difficult task. Currently. NR quality assessment is feasible only when prior knowledge about the types of image distortion is available. This research aims to develop NR quality measurement algorithms for JPEG compressed images. First. we established a JPEG image database and subjective experiments were conducted on the database. We show that Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). which requires the reference images. is a poor indicator of subjective quality. Therefore. tuning an NR measurement model towards PSNR is not an appropriate approach in designing NR quality metrics.

While significant progress has been made in measuring local image quality/distortion. the pooling stage is often done in ad-hoc ways. lacking theoretical principles and reliable computational models. This paper aims to test the hypothesis that when viewing natural images. the optimal perceptual weights for pooling should be proportional to local information content. which can be estimated in units of bit using advanced statistical models of natural images.

Despite the strong clinical correlation. breast density has not been causally linked to tumorigenesis. largely because no animal model has existed for studying breast tissue density. Importantly. regions of high breast density are associated with increased stromal collagen. Thus. the influence of the extracellular matrix on breast carcinoma development and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not understood. To study the effects of collagen density on mammary tumor formation and progression. we utilized a bi-transgenic tumor model with increased stromal collagen in mouse mammary tissue. Imaging of the tumors and tumor-stromal interface in live tumor tissue was performed with multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy to generate multiphoton excitation and spectrally resolved fluorescent lifetimes of endogenous fluorophores. Second harmonic generation was utilized to image stromal collagen. Herein we demonstrate that increased stromal collagen in mouse mammary tissue significantly increases tumor formation approximately three-fold (p < 0.00001) and results in a significantly more invasive phenotype with approximately three times more lung metastasis (p < 0.05). Furthermore. the increased invasive phenotype of tumor cells that arose within collagen-dense mammary tissues remains after tumor explants are cultured within reconstituted three-dimensional collagen gels.

In particular. new developments in light microscopy that provide the potential to image the dynamics of biological events have had significant impact. Optical sectioning techniques allow three‐dimensional information to be obtained from living specimens noninvasively. When used with multimodal fluorescence microscopy. advanced optical sectioning techniques provide multidimensional image data that can reveal information not only about the changing cytoarchitecture of a cell but also about its physiology. These additional dimensions of information. although providing powerful tools. also pose significant visualization challenges to the investigator.

Identification of these images using automated image analysis with high accuracy is important for obtaining a clean. unbiased image dataset. Complicating this task is the fact that image focus quality is only well-defined in foreground regions of images. and as a result. most previous approaches only enable a computation of the relative difference in quality between two or more images. rather than an absolute measure of quality. We present a deep neural network model capable of predicting an absolute measure of image focus on a single image in isolation. without any user-specified parameters. The model operates at the image-patch level. and also outputs a measure of prediction certainty. enabling interpretable predictions. The model was trained on only 384 in-focus Hoechst (nuclei) stain images of U2OS cells. which were synthetically defocused to one of 11 absolute defocus levels during training. The trained model can generalize on previously unseen real Hoechst stain images. identifying the absolute image focus to within one defocus level (approximately 3 pixel blur diameter difference) with 95% accuracy. On a simpler binary in/out-of-focus classification task. the trained model outperforms previous approaches on both Hoechst and Phalloidin (actin) stain images (F-scores of 0.89 and 0.86. respectively over 0.84 and 0.83). despite only having been presented Hoechst stain images during training.

Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms. signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression. regularization in inverse problems. feature extraction. and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques have been considered. but this topic is largely still open.

The approach taken is based on sparse and redundant representations over trained dictionaries. Using the K-SVD algorithm. we obtain a dictionary that describes the image content effectively. Two training options are considered: using the corrupted image itself. or training on a corpus of high-quality image database. Since the K-SVD is limited in handling small image patches. we extend its deployment to arbitrary image sizes by defining a global image prior that forces sparsity over patches in every location in the image. We show how such Bayesian treatment leads to a simple and effective denoising algorithm.

In particular. we aim for the sparsest representation possible. In general. this requires a combinatorial optimization process. Previous work considered the special case where D is an overcomplete system consisting of exactly two orthobases and has shown that. under a condition of mutual incoherence of the two bases. and assuming that S has a sufficiently sparse representation. this representation is unique and can be found by solving a convex optimization problem: specifically. minimizing the ℓ1 norm of the coefficients γ̱.

However. in general. the problem of finding sparse representations must be unstable in the presence of noise. This paper establishes the possibility of stable recovery under a combination of sufficient sparsity and favorable structure of the overcomplete system. Considering an ideal underlying signal that has a sufficiently sparse representation. it is assumed that only a noisy version of it can be observed. Assuming further that the overcomplete system is incoherent. it is shown that the optimally sparse approximation to the noisy data differs from the optimally sparse decomposition of the ideal noiseless signal by at most a constant multiple of the noise level.

Heidelberg,This paper deals with the single image scale-up problem using sparse-representation modeling. The goal is to recover an original image from its blurred and down-scaled noisy version. Since this problem is highly ill-posed. a prior is needed in order to regularize it. The literature offers various ways to address this problem. ranging from simple linear space-invariant interpolation schemes (e.g.. bicubic interpolation). to spatially-adaptive and non-linear filters of various sorts. We embark from a recently-proposed successful algorithm by Yang et. al. [1.2]. and similarly assume a local Sparse-Land model on image patches. serving as regularization.

The volcano curve is also consistent with Pt being the most efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.© 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

For cases with a deletion mutation. the “reading frame” hypothesis predicts that BMD patients produce a semifunctional. internally deleted dystrophin protein. whereas DMD patients produce a severely truncated protein that would be unstable. To test the validity of this theory. we analyzed 258 independent deletions at the DMD/BMD locus. The correlation between phenotype and type of deletion mutation is in agreement with the “reading frame” theory in 92% of cases and is of diagnostic and prognostic significance. The distribution and frequency of deletions spanning the entire locus suggests that many “in-frame” deletions of the dystrophin gene are not detected because the individuals bearing them are either asymptomatic or exhibit non-DMD/non-BMD clinical features.,True,sYoITQ8AAAAJ:VwjN40uvqCUC,1150,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1683519/,16599034751405816114,/scholar?cites=16599034751405816114,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1683519/pdf/ajhg00107-0016.pdf,0,0,0

In each case investigated. the Pt surface d-band was broadened and lowered in energy by interactions with the subsurface 3d metals. resulting in weaker dissociative adsorption energies of hydrogen and oxygen on these surfaces. The magnitude of the decrease in adsorption energy was largest for the early 3d transition metals and smallest for the late 3d transition metals. In some cases. dissociative adsorption was calculated to be endothermic. The surfaces investigated in this study had no lateral strain in them. demonstrating that strain is not a necessary factor in the modification of bimetallic surface properties.

Let K denote the total number of frequencies in the signal. and let W denote its band limit in hertz.

SRC first codes a testing sample as a sparse linear combination of all the training samples. and then classifies the testing sample by evaluating which class leads to the minimum representation error. While the importance of sparsity is much emphasized in SRC and many related works. the use of collaborative representation (CR) in SRC is ignored by most literature. However. is it really the l 1 -norm sparsity that improves the FR accuracy?

The standard nuclear norm minimization regularizes each singular value equally to pursue the convexity of the objective function. However. this greatly restricts its capability and flexibility in dealing with many practical problems (eg. denoising). where the singular values have clear physical meanings and should be treated differently. In this paper we study the weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) problem. where the singular values are assigned different weights. The solutions of the WNNM problem are analyzed under different weighting conditions. We then apply the proposed WNNM algorithm to image denoising by exploiting the image nonlocal self-similarity.

Existing methods use various constraints/priors to get plausible dehazing solutions. The key to achieve haze removal is to estimate a medium transmission map for an input hazy image. In this paper. we propose a trainable end-to-end system called DehazeNet. for medium transmission estimation. DehazeNet takes a hazy image as input. and outputs its medium transmission map that is subsequently used to recover a haze-free image via atmospheric scattering model. DehazeNet adopts convolutional neural network-based deep architecture. whose layers are specially designed to embody the established assumptions/priors in image dehazing.

However. the performance of SVM-based relevance feedback is often poor when the number of labeled positive feedback samples is small. This is mainly due to three reasons: 1) an SVM classifier is unstable on a small-sized training set. 2) SVM's optimal hyperplane may be biased when the positive feedback samples are much less than the negative feedback samples. and 3) overfitting happens because the number of feature dimensions is much higher than the size of the training set. In this paper. we develop a mechanism to overcome these problems. To address the first two problems. we propose an asymmetric bagging-based SVM (AB-SVM).

1274823,A survey on multi-view learning,2013,Chang Xu and Dacheng Tao and Chao Xu,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1304.5634,,,,In recent years. a great many methods of learning from multi-view data by considering the diversity of different views have been proposed. These views may be obtained from multiple sources or different feature subsets. In trying to organize and highlight similarities and differences between the variety of multi-view learning approaches. we review a number of representative multi-view learning algorithms in different areas and classify them into three groups: 1) co-training. 2) multiple kernel learning. and 3) subspace learning. Notably. co-training style algorithms train alternately to maximize the mutual agreement on two distinct views of the data; multiple kernel learning algorithms exploit kernels that naturally correspond to different views and combine kernels either linearly or non-linearly to improve learning performance; and subspace learning algorithms aim to obtain a latent subspace shared by multiple views by assuming that the input views are generated from this latent subspace. Though there is significant variance in the approaches to integrating multiple views to improve learning performance. they mainly exploit either the consensus principle or the complementary principle to ensure the success of multi-view learning. Since accessing multiple views is the fundament of multi-view learning. with the exception of study on learning a model from multiple views. it is also valuable to study how to construct multiple views and how to evaluate these views. Overall. by exploring the consistency and complementary properties of different views. multi-view learning is rendered more effective. more promising. and has better generalization ability than …,True,RwlJNLcAAAAJ:TlpoogIpr_IC,891,https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5634,5044993526050160522,/scholar?cites=5044993526050160522,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5634,0,0,0

A powerful and efficient Integrated Correlation Filter (ICF) is employed in the short-term store for short-term tracking.

In this paper. we develop ""Go Decomposition"" (GoDec) to efficiently and robustly estimate the low-rank part L and the sparse part 5 of a matrix X = L + S + G with noise G. GoDec alternatively assigns the low-rank approximation of X - S to L and the sparse approximation of X - L to S. The algorithm can be significantly accelerated by bilateral random projections (BRP). We also propose GoDec for matrix completion as an important variant. We prove that the objective value ∥X - L - S∥F2 converges to a local minimum. while L and S linearly converge to local optimums. Theoretically. we analyze the influence of L. S and G to the asymptotic/convergence speeds in order to discover the robustness of GoDec.

One of the most important subspace approaches is the linear dimensionality reduction step in the Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA). which has been successfully employed in many fields such as biometrics. bioinformatics. and multimedia information management. However. the linear dimensionality reduction step in FLDA has a critical drawback: for a classification task with c classes. if the dimension of the projected subspace is strictly lower than c - 1. the projection to a subspace tends to merge those classes. which are close together in the original feature space. If separate classes are sampled from Gaussian distributions. all with identical covariance matrices. then the linear dimensionality reduction step in FLDA maximizes the mean value of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between different classes …,True,RwlJNLcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,590,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4479477/,9030002187112165257,/scholar?cites=9030002187112165257,,,,0,0,0

Recent methods have gained significant improvement by exploring image-level information and hierarchical features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). These methods model depth estimation as a regression problem and train the regression networks by minimizing mean squared error. which suffers from slow convergence and unsatisfactory local solutions. Besides. existing depth estimation networks employ repeated spatial pooling operations. resulting in undesirable low-resolution feature maps. To obtain high-resolution depth maps. skip-connections or multi-layer deconvolution networks are required. which complicates network training and consumes much more computations. To eliminate or at least largely reduce these problems. we introduce a spacing-increasing discretization (SID) strategy to discretize depth and recast depth network learning as an ordinal regression problem. By training the network using an ordinary regression loss. our method achieves much higher accuracy and faster convergence in synch. Furthermore. we adopt a multi-scale network structure which avoids unnecessary spatial pooling and captures multi-scale information in parallel. The proposed deep ordinal regression network (DORN) achieves state-of-the-art results on three challenging benchmarks. ie. KITTI [16].
