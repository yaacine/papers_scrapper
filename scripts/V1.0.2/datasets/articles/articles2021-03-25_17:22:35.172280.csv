1223731,A slow RNA polymerase II affects alternative splicing in vivo,2003,Manuel de la Mata and Claudio R Alonso and Sebastián Kadener and Juan P Fededa and Matıas Blaustein and Federico Pelisch and Paula Cramer and David Bentley and Alberto R Kornblihtt,12,Molecular cell,2,525-532,Cell Press,Changes in promoter structure and occupation have been shown to modify the splicing pattern of several genes. evidencing a coupling between transcription and alternative splicing. It has been proposed that the promoter effect involves modulation of RNA pol II elongation rates. The C4 point mutation of the Drosophila pol II largest subunit confers on the enzyme a lower elongation rate. Here we show that expression of a human equivalent to Drosophila's C4 pol II in human cultured cells affects alternative splicing of the fibronectin EDI exon and adenovirus E1a pre-mRNA. Most importantly. resplicing of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax is stimulated in Drosophila embryos mutant for C4. which demonstrates the transcriptional control of alternative splicing on an endogenous gene.

Here we show that ultraviolet irradiation (UV) affects cotranscriptional AS in a p53-independent way. through the hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) and a subsequent inhibition of transcriptional elongation. estimated in vivo and in real time. Phosphomimetic CTD mutants not only display lower elongation but also duplicate the UV effect on AS. Consistently. nonphosphorylatable mutants prevent the UV effect. Apoptosis promoted by UV in cells lacking p53 is prevented when the change in AS of the apoptotic gene bcl-x is reverted. confirming the relevance of this mechanism.

Several postsplicing activities have been described for a subset of shuttling SR proteins. including regulation of mRNA export and translation. Using the fibronectin gene to study the links between signal-transduction pathways and SR protein activity. we show that growth factors not only modify the alternative splicing pattern of the fibronectin gene but also alter translation of reporter messenger RNAs in an SR protein–dependent fashion. providing two coregulated levels of isoform-specific amplification. These effects are inhibited by specific small interfering RNAs against SR proteins and are mediated by the AKT kinase. which elicits opposite effects to those evoked by overexpressing SR protein kinases Clk and SRPK.

However. their implication in small RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing in the mammalian cell nucleus is less understood. We have recently shown that intronic siRNAs cause chromatin modifications that inhibit RNA polymerase II elongation and modulate alternative splicing in an Argonaute-1 (AGO1)-dependent manner. Here we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to investigate the genome-wide distribution of AGO1 nuclear targets. Unexpectedly. we found that about 80% of AGO1 clusters are associated with cell-type-specific transcriptional enhancers. most of them (73%) overlapping active enhancers.

To this end. we used a series of chemical compounds that modulate PI3K/Akt pathway and monitored the activity of the three UPR branches: PERK. IRE1 and ATF6. The antiproliferative and antiviral drug Akt-IV strongly and persistently activated all three branches of the UPR. We present evidence that activation of PERK/eIF2α requires Akt and that PERK is a direct Akt target. Chemical activation of this novel Akt/PERK pathway by Akt-IV leads to cell death. which was largely dependent on the presence of PERK and IRE1.

Recently. the way in which FXN interacts with the rest of the subunits of the supercomplex was uncovered. This opens a window to explore relationships between structural dynamics and function. In this study. we prepared a set of FXN variants spanning a broad range of conformational stabilities. Variants S160I. S160M and A204R were more stable than the wild-type and showed similar biological activity. Additionally. we prepared SILCAR. a variant that combines S160I. L203C and A204R mutations.

In the last few years. novel Akt posttranslational modifications have been found. However. how these modification patterns affect Akt subcellular localization. target specificity and function is not thoroughly understood. Here. we postulate and experimentally demonstrate by acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay and 3H-palmitate labeling that Akt is S-palmitoylated. a modification related to protein sorting throughout subcellular membranes. Mutating cysteine 344 into serine blocked Akt S-palmitoylation and diminished its phosphorylation at two key sites. T308 and T450. Particularly. we show that palmitoylation-deficient Akt increases its recruitment to cytoplasmic structures that colocalize with lysosomes. a process stimulated during autophagy. Finally. we found that Akt1 cysteine 344 is important for proper Akt function. since Akt1-C344S was unable to support adipocyte cell differentiation in vitro.

1223766,Target RNAs strike back on microRNAs,2018,Federico Fuchs Wightman and Luciana E Giono and Juan Pablo Fededa and Manuel de la Mata,9,,,435,Frontiers,MicroRNAs are extensively studied regulatory non-coding small RNAs that silence animal genes throughout most biological processes. typically doing so by binding to partially complementary sequences within target RNAs. A plethora of studies has described detailed mechanisms for microRNA biogenesis and function. as well as their temporal and spatial regulation during development. By inducing translational repression and/or degradation of their target RNAs. microRNAs can contribute to achieve highly specific cell- or tissue-specific gene expression. while their aberrant expression can lead to disease. Yet an unresolved aspect of microRNA biology is how such small RNA molecules are themselves cleared from the cell. especially under circumstances where fast microRNA turnover or specific degradation of individual microRNAs are required. In recent years. it was unexpectedly found that binding of specific target RNAs to microRNAs with extensive complementarity can reverse the outcome. triggering degradation of the bound microRNAs. This emerging pathway. named TDMD for Target RNA-Directed MicroRNA Degradation. leads to microRNA 3’-end tailing by the addition of A/U non-templated nucleotides. trimming or shortening from the 3’ end. and highly specific microRNA loss. providing a new layer of microRNA regulation.

Our group in studies performed on the fibronectin gene originally described promoter control of alternative splicing. Recently. other labs extended our findings to the cystic fibrosis. CD44 and CGRP genes strongly supporting a coupling between transcription and pre-mRNA processing. A possible model for promoter control of alternative splicing involves modulation of RNA pol II (pol II) processivity. In fact. transcriptional activators such as VP-16 and HIV-Tat. that enhance pol II elongation. stimulate exon skipping while chromatin compaction elicited by template replication provokes lower pol II processivities which result in higher exon inclusion rates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies to pol II showed that exon inclusion correlates with higher pol II densities in upstream gene regions. Furthermore. we proved the processivity model with a direct tool: the C4 mutation (R741H) of the Drosophila pol II largest subunit that confers the enzyme a lower elongation rate. Expression of a human equivalent (R749H) of the Drosophila C4 pol II in cultured cells inhibits skipping of the fibronectin EDI exon and favours the use of distal 5! sites in adenovirus E1a splicing. In addition. re-splicing of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax is stimulated in fly embryos mutant for C4. Interestingly the C4 mutation has been described to enhance the ultrabithorax phenotype.

We dissected and measured sources of variation in system output. analysing thousands of individual. genetically identical cells. Only a small proportion of total cell-to-cell variation is caused by random fluctuations in gene transcription and translation during the response (‘expression noise’). Instead. variation is dominated by differences in the capacity of individual cells to transmit signals through the pathway (‘pathway capacity’) and to express proteins from genes (‘expression capacity’). Cells with high expression capacity express proteins at a higher rate and increase in volume more rapidly.

We investigated the splicing of the ED I exon. which encodes a facultative type III repeat of fibronectin. whose inclusion is regulated during development and in proliferative processes. We used an alternative splicing assay combined with promoter swapping to demonstrate that the extent of ED I splicing is dependent on the promoter structure from which the transcript originated and that this regulation is independent of the promoter strength.

Fungal hosts are preferred for organic acid production because they tolerate lignocellulosic hydrolysates and low pH. allowing economic production and recovery of the free acid. However. cell death caused by cytosolic acidification constrains productivity. Cytosolic acidification affects cells asynchronously. suggesting that there is an underlying cell-to-cell heterogeneity in acid productivity and/or in resistance to toxicity. We used fluorescence microscopy to investigate the relationship between enzyme concentration. cytosolic pH. and viability at the single-cell level in Saccharomyces cerevisiae engineered to synthesize xylonic acid.

All members of the class are terrestrial. but they attained terrestriality independently of insects. Myriapoda is the only arthropod class not represented by a sequenced genome. We present an analysis of the genome of the centipede Strigamia maritima. It retains a compact genome that has undergone less gene loss and shuffling than previously sequenced arthropods. and many orthologues of genes conserved from the bilaterian ancestor that have been lost in insects. Our analysis locates many genes in conserved macro-synteny contexts. and many small-scale examples of gene clustering. We describe several examples where S. maritima shows different solutions from insects to similar problems. The insect olfactory receptor gene family is absent from S. maritima. and olfaction in air is likely effected by expansion of other receptor gene families. For some genes S. maritima has evolved paralogues to generate coding sequence diversity. where insects use alternate splicing. This is most striking for the Dscam gene. which in Drosophila generates more than 100.000 alternate splice forms. but in S. maritima is encoded by over 100 paralogues. We see an intriguing linkage between the absence of any known photosensory proteins in a blind organism and the additional absence of canonical circadian clock genes.

We found that mutation of a single miRNA locus (miR-iab4/iab8) in Drosophila larvae affects the animal’s capacity to correct its orientation if turned upside down (self-righting). One of the miRNA targets involved in this behavior is the Hox gene Ultrabithorax. whose derepression in two metameric neurons leads to self-righting defects. In vivo neural activity analysis reveals that these neurons. the self-righting node (SRN). have different activity patterns in wild type and miRNA mutants. whereas thermogenetic manipulation of SRN activity results in changes in self-righting behavior. Our work thus reveals a miRNA-encoded behavior and suggests that other miRNAs might also be involved in behavioral control in Drosophila and other species.,True,0l__eQEAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,49,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6262/815.abstract,4877690333960801297,/scholar?cites=4877690333960801297,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4902127/,0,0,0

To test this model. we used telomere-specific quantitative proteomics on cells with heterochromatin deficiencies. In contrast to expectations. we found that ALT does not result from a lack of heterochromatin; rather. ALT is a consequence of heterochromatin formation at telomeres. which is seeded by the histone methyltransferase SETDB1. Heterochromatin stimulates transcriptional elongation at telomeres together with the recruitment of recombination factors. while disrupting heterochromatin had the opposite effect.

These changes in accessibility were not exclusive to distal enhancers. but also occurred at promoter regions. suggesting a role for promoters in mediating cell-state transitions. Notably. we found that a subset of immune genes already exhibited chromatin accessibility in OPCs ex vivo and in vivo. suggesting a primed chromatin state in OLG compatible with rapid transitions to an immune-competent state. Several primed genes presented bivalency of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at promoters in OPCs. with loss of H3K27me3 upon IFN-gamma treatment. Inhibition of JMJD3/Kdm6b. mediating removal of H3K27me3. led to the inability to activate these genes upon IFN-gamma treatment. Importantly.

Chromatin has been shown to impact this recruitment. However. a limited number of histone marks have been studied at a global level. In this work. a machine learning approach. applied to extensive epigenomics datasets in human H1 embryonic stem cells and IMR90 foetal fibroblasts. has identified eleven chromatin modifications that differentially mark alternatively spliced exons depending on the level of exon inclusion. These marks act in a combinatorial and position-dependent way. creating characteristic splicing-associated chromatin signatures (SACS). In support of a functional role for SACS in coordinating splicing regulation. changes in the alternative splicing of SACS-marked exons between ten different cell lines correlate with changes in SACS enrichment levels and recruitment of the splicing …,True,xzVpLYoAAAAJ:uPCvBZYD9qUC,0,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-20979-x,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-20979-x,0,0,0

Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced. the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20.000-23.000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution. while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example. the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements. both non-coding and coding. Notably. many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes.

The experiment had two major goals: the assessment of the accuracy of computational methods to predict protein coding genes; and the overall assessment of the completeness of the current human genome annotations as represented in the ENCODE regions. For the computational prediction assessment. eighteen groups contributed gene predictions. We evaluated these submissions against each other based on a 'reference set' of annotations generated as part of the GENCODE project. These annotations were not available to the prediction groups prior to the submission deadline. so that their predictions were blind and an external advisory committee could perform a fair assessment. The best methods had at least one gene transcript correctly predicted for close to 70% of the annotated genes. Nevertheless. the multiple transcript accuracy. taking into account alternative splicing. reached only approximately 40% to 50% accuracy. At the coding nucleotide level. the best programs reached an accuracy of 90% in both sensitivity and specificity. Programs relying on mRNA and protein sequences were the most accurate in reproducing the manually curated annotations.

Splicing of introns is directed by three main splicing signals: the 5′ splice site (5′ss). the branch site (BS). and the polypyrimdine tract/3′splice site (PPT-3′ss). To study the evolution of these splicing signals. we have conducted a systematic comparative analysis of these signals in over 1.2 million introns from 22 eukaryotes. Our analyses suggest that all these signals have dramatically evolved: The PPT is weak among most fungi. intermediate in plants and protozoans. and strongest in metazoans. Within metazoans it shows a gradual strengthening from Caenorhabditis elegans to human. The 5′ss and the BS were found to be degenerate among most organisms. but highly conserved among some fungi.

In mammals. the degeneracy of the motif combined with the lack of a large set of experimentally verified BPs complicates the task of modeling it in silico. and therefore of predicting the location of natural BPs. Consequently. BPs have been disregarded in a considerable fraction of the genome-wide studies on the regulation of splicing in mammals. We present a new computational approach for mammalian BP prediction. Using sequence conservation and positional bias we obtained a set of motifs with good agreement with U2 snRNA binding stability. Using a Support Vector Machine algorithm. we created a model complemented with polypyrimidine tract features. which considerably improves the prediction accuracy over previously published methods. Applying our algorithm to human introns. we show that BP position is highly dependent on the presence of AG dinucleotides in the 3′ end of introns. with distance to the 3′ splice site and BP strength strongly correlating with alternative splicing. Furthermore. experimental BP mapping for five exons preceded by long AG-dinucleotide exclusion zones revealed that. for a given intron. more than one BP can be chosen throughout the course of splicing. Finally. the comparison between exons of different evolutionary ages and pseudo exons suggests a key role of the BP in the pathway of exon creation in human. Our computational and experimental analyses suggest that BP recognition is more flexible than previously assumed. and it appears highly dependent on the presence of downstream polypyrimidine tracts …,True,LiojlGoAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,161,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001016,7609919501081241440,/scholar?cites=7609919501081241440,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001016,0,0,0

Silencing of the TOC1 gene causes arrhythmia in constant darkness and in various intensities of red light. whereas in blue light. the clock runs faster in silenced plants than in wild-type plants. Increments in TOC1 gene dosage delayed the pace of the clock. whereas TOC1 overexpression abolished rhythmicity in all light conditions tested. Our results show that TOC1 RNA interference and toc1-2 mutant plants displayed an important reduction in sensitivity to red and far-red light in the control of hypocotyl elongation. whereas increments in TOC1 gene dosage clearly enhanced light sensitivity.

Ltd,The RNA-binding protein hnRNP A1 is a splicing regulator produced by exclusion of alternative exon 7B from the A1 pre-mRNA. Each intron flanking exon 7B contains a high-affinity A1-binding site. The A1-binding elements promote exon skipping in vivo. activate distal 5! splice site selection in vitro and improve the responsiveness of pre-mRNAs to increases in the concentration of A1. Whereas the glycine-rich C-terminal domain of A1 is not required for binding. it is essential to activate the distal 5! splice site. Because A1 complexes can interact simultaneously with two A1-binding sites. we propose that an interaction between bound A1 proteins facilitates the pairing of distant splice sites.

Here we show that intronic hnRNP A/B–binding sites (ABS) can stimulate the in vitro splicing of pre-mRNAs containing artificially enlarged introns. Stimulation of in vitro splicing could also be obtained by providing intronic ABS in trans through the use of antisense oligonucleotides containing a non-hybridizing ABS-carrying tail. ABS-tailed oligonucleotides also improved the in vivo inclusion of an alternative exon flanked by an enlarged intron. Notably. binding sites for hnRNP F/H proteins (FBS) replicate the activity of ABS by improving the splicing of an enlarged intron and by modulating 5′ splice-site selection. One hypothesis formulated to explain these effects is that bound hnRNP proteins self-interact to bring in closer proximity the external pair of splice sites. Consistent with this model. positioning FBS or ABS at both ends of an intron was required to stimulate splicing of some pre-mRNAs. In addition. a computational analysis of the configuration of putative FBS and ABS located at the ends of introns supports the view that these motifs have evolved to support cooperative interactions.

In vitro splicing assays indicate that a conserved element (CE1) from the central portion of the intron shifts selection toward the distal donor site when positioned in between the 59 splice sites of exon 7 and 7B. In vivo. the CE1 element promotes exon 7B skipping. A 17-nucleotide sequence within CE1 (CE1a) is sufficient to activate the distal 59 splice site.

We noted that conserved sequences in HSURs 1 and 2 constitute potential binding sites for three host-cell microRNAs (miRNAs).

T‐Ag‐mediated replication. reported to inhibit RNA polymerase II elongation. provokes a 10‐to 30‐fold increase in the inclusion of the fibronectin EDI exon into mature mRNA. The T‐Ag effect is exon specific. occurs in cis and depends strictly on DNA replication and not on cell transformation. VP16. an activator of transcriptional initiation and elongation. has a similar effect on transcription but the opposite effect on splicing: EDI inclusion is inhibited by 35‐fold.

HSUR2 inhibits apoptosis in infected cells by recruiting host miRNAs miR-142–3p and miR-16 to mRNAs encoding apoptotic factors. HSUR2’s target recognition mechanism is not understood. It is also unknown why HSUR2 utilizes miR-16 to downregulate only a subset of transcripts. We developed a general method for individual-nucleotide resolution RNA-RNA interaction identification by crosslinking and capture (iRICC) to identify sequences mediating interactions between HSUR2 and target mRNAs in vivo. Mutational analyses confirmed identified HSUR2-mRNA interactions and validated iRICC as a method that confidently determines sequences mediating RNA-RNA interactions in vivo. We show that HSUR2 does not display a ‘seed’ region to base-pair with most target mRNAs. but instead uses different regions to interact with different transcripts. We further demonstrate that this versatile mode of interaction via variable base-pairing provides HSUR2 with a mechanism for differential miRNA recruitment.,True,xzHni00AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,2,https://elifesciences.org/articles/50530,17240550520814840155,/scholar?cites=17240550520814840155,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/50530.pdf,0,0,0
1224005,Novel roles for Sm-class RNAs in the regulation of gene expression,2018,Demián Cazalla,15,,7,856-862,Taylor & Francis,Viruses masterfully regulate host gene expression during infection. Many do so. in part. by expressing non-coding RNAs. Recent work has shown that HSUR 2. a viral non-coding RNA expressed by the oncogenic Herpesvirus saimiri. regulates mRNA expression through a novel mechanism. HSUR 2 base pairs with both target mRNAs and host miRNAs in infected cells. This results in HSUR 2-dependent recruitment of host miRNAs and associated Ago proteins to target mRNAs. and the subsequent destabilization of target mRNAs. Using this mechanism. this virus regulates key cellular pathways during viral infection. Here I discuss the evolution of our thinking about HSUR function and explore the implications of recent findings in relation to the current views on the functions of interactions between miRNAs and other classes of non-coding RNAs. the potential advantages of this mechanism of regulation of gene …,True,xzHni00AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,2,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15476286.2018.1467176,13366575010586074030,/scholar?cites=13366575010586074030,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15476286.2018.1467176,0,0,0

1224009,Functional characterisation of a novel arginine/serine-rich splicing factor,2003,Demián Cazalla,,,,,,Using a modified gene trap strategy. a novel factor involved in mRNA processing. USSRp58. was identified. Analysis of the USSRp58 sequence revealed that it contains an RS domain. common to factors involved in pre-mRNA splicing. and more generally in RNA processing. The subcellular localisation of the endogenous USSRp58 protein. as well of transiently expressed epitope-tagged USSRp58 protein. revealed that this protein localises to nuclear speckles. which suggests a potential role in pre-mRNA splicing. Two-hybrid analysis and immunoprecipitation/We stern blot assays have been used to demonstrate that USSRp58 interacts with different proteins that have either potential or clearly defined functions in splicing. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that USSRp58 also interacts with spliceosomal snRNPs. indicating that it is physically associated with the splicing apparatus. Using in vivo and in vitro splicing assays. USSRp58 was shown to be functionally involved in splicing. Transient overexpression of USSRp58 in cultured cells and analysis of the alternative splicing of an adenovirus E1A reporter indicated that the protein can regulate 5' splice site selection in vivo. Furthermore. nuclear extracts immunodepleted of USSRp58 are unable to perform the second step of splicing in vitro. suggesting that this protein is necessary for this step.   A final set of results describing a nuclear retention signal (NRS) in the RS domain of SC35 was also included in this thesis. Chimeric proteins in which the RS domain of a nonshuttling SR protein.

A key question in plant splicing is the role of AU sequences and how and at what stage they are involved in spliceosome assembly. Clearly. intronic U- or AU-rich and exonic GC- and AG-rich elements can influence splice site selection and splicing efficiency and are likely to bind proteins. It is becoming clear that splicing of a particular intron depends on a fine balance in the “strength” of the multiple intron signals involved in splice site selection. Individual introns contain varying strengths of signals and what is critical to splicing of one intron may be of less importance to the splicing of another.

We observed significant correlations of days to heading (flowering) and height with seasonal temperature and dryness variables in common garden experiments. suggesting that these traits were major drivers of environmental adaptation in the sampled germplasm.

The diversity and complexity of this gene family continues to expand with the discovery of snoRNAs with non-rRNA or unknown targets. Plants contain more snoRNAs than other eukaryotes and have developed novel expression and processing strategies. The increased number of modifications. which will influence ribosome function. and the novel modes of expression might reflect the environmental conditions to which plants are exposed.

All of the characterized mutants discussed here contain base substitutions in either the 5'splice site: GU or 3'splice site AG: dinucleotides or broader splice site consensus sequences. Many of these mutations lead to the activation of cryptic splice sites. usually upstream or downstream of the authentic 5'and 3'splice sites respectively. often with reduced efficiency. This splicing behaviour is in agreement with detailed splicing analyses of test plant introns. However. some of the Arabidopsis mutations lead to more complex splicing patterns often involving exon skipping. These mutations illustrate the complexity of the splicing reaction (where the final splicing event reflects the characteristics such as splice site sequence. intron size and composition. and their interactions with spliceosomal components) and how single nucleotide mutations can affect the strength and balance of interactions to alter splicing patterns. The splicing patterns observed in the Arabidopsis mutants parallel those seen in mutations causing some human genetic disorders underlining the emerging similarities in mechanisms of splice site selection and intron/exon definition between plant and vertebrate systems. Analysis of the Arabidopsis intron mutations exhibiting complex splicing patterns will help to address fundamental questions in plant splicing. such as splice site selection and exon scanning.

Within the mammalian cell nucleus. most splicing factors are concentrated in 20–40 distinct domains called speckles 3. The function of speckles and the organization of cellular transcription and pre-mRNA splicing in vivo are not well understood. We have investigated the dynamic properties of splicing factors in nuclei of living cells. Here we show that speckles are highly dynamic structures that respond specifically to activation of nearby genes. These dynamic events are dependent on RNA polymerase II transcription. and are sensitive to inhibitors of protein kinases and Ser/Thr phosphatases. When single genes are transcription-ally activated in living cells. splicing factors leave speckles in peripheral extensions and accumulate at the new sites of transcription.

Normally silent repeat regions are active in ESCs. and tissue-specific genes are sporadically expressed at low levels. Whole-genome tiling arrays demonstrate widespread transcription in coding and noncoding regions in ESCs. whereas the transcriptional landscape becomes more discrete as differentiation proceeds.

Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a major component of heterochromatin and thus is a candidate for establishing and maintaining the transcriptionally repressive heterochromatin structure. Here we demonstrate that maintenance of stable heterochromatin domains in living cells involves the transient binding and dynamic exchange of HP1 from chromatin. HP1 exchange kinetics correlate with the condensation level of chromatin and are dependent on the histone methyltransferase Suv39h. The chromodomain and the chromoshadow domain of HP1 are both required for binding to native chromatin in vivo. but they contribute differentially to binding in euchromatin and heterochromatin.

At onset of the mitochondrial permeability transition. mitochondria depolarize. uncouple. and undergo large amplitude swelling due to opening of permeability transition pores. which may form by aggregation of damaged. misfolded membrane proteins.

One reason for this is that although these organelles are inherent to all cells. drugs are being developed that selectively target the mitochondria of malignant cells without adversely affecting those of normal cells. Such anti-cancer drugs destabilize cancer cell mitochondria and these compounds are referred to as mitocans. classified into several groups according to their mode of action and the location or nature of their specific drug targets. Many mitocans selectively interfere with the bioenergetic functions of cancer cell mitochondria. causing major disruptions often associated with ensuing overloads in ROS production leading to the induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

1224071,Metabolic control analysis: a tool for designing strategies to manipulate metabolic pathways,2008,Rafael Moreno-Sánchez and Emma Saavedra and Sara Rodríguez-Enríquez and Viridiana Olín-Sandoval,2008,,,,Hindawi,The traditional experimental approaches used for changing the flux or the concentration of a particular metabolite of a metabolic pathway have been mostly based on the inhibition or over-expression of the presumed rate-limiting step. However. the attempts to manipulate a metabolic pathway by following such approach have proved to be unsuccessful. Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) establishes how to determine. quantitatively. the degree of control that a given enzyme exerts on flux and on the concentration of metabolites. thus substituting the intuitive. qualitative concept of rate limiting step.  Moreover. MCA helps to understand (i) the underlying mechanisms by which a given enzyme exerts high or low control and (ii) why the control of the pathway is shared by several pathway enzymes and transporters. By applying MCA it is possible to identify the steps that should be modified to achieve a successful alteration of flux or metabolite concentration in pathways of biotechnological (e.g.. large scale metabolite production) or clinical relevance (e.g.. drug therapy).  The different MCA experimental approaches developed for the determination of the flux-control distribution in several pathways are described.

However. the attempts to manipulate a metabolic pathway by following such approach have proved to be unsuccessful. Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) establishes how to determine. quantitatively. the degree of control that a given enzyme exerts on flux and on the concentration of metabolites. thus substituting the intuitive. qualitative concept of rate limiting step.  Moreover. MCA helps to understand (i) the underlying mechanisms by which a given enzyme exerts high or low control and (ii) why the control of the pathway is shared by several pathway enzymes and transporters. By applying MCA it is possible to identify the steps that should be modified to achieve a successful alteration of flux or metabolite concentration in pathways of biotechnological (e.g.. large scale metabolite production) or clinical relevance (e.g.. drug therapy).  The different MCA experimental approaches developed for the determination of the flux-control distribution in several pathways are described.

Changes in ER homeostasis lead to stress responses with an activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The Entamoeba histolytica endomembrane system is simple compared to those of higher eukaryotes. as a canonical ER is not observed. During amoebiasis. an infection of the human intestine and liver by E. histolytica. nitric oxide (NO) triggers an apoptotic-like event preceded by an impairment of energy production and a loss of important parasite pathogenic features. We address the question of how this ancient eukaryote responds to stress induced by immune components (i.e. NO) and whether stress leads to ER changes and subsequently to an UPR. Gene expression analysis suggested that NO triggers stress responses marked by (i) dramatic up-regulation of hsp genes although a bona fide UPR is absent; (ii) induction of DNA repair and redox gene expression and iii) up-regulation of glycolysis-related gene expression. Enzymology approaches demonstrate that NO directly inhibits glycolysis and enhance cysteine synthase activity. Using live imaging and confocal microscopy we found that NO dramatically provokes extensive ER fragmentation. ER fission in E. histolytica appears as a protective response against stress. as it has been recently proposed for neuron self-defense during neurologic disorders.

This is based on biochemical analyses and molecular modelling. revealing similar or stronger interaction energy of α-TOS compared to that of UbQ for the Q P and Q D sites. respectively. CybL-mutant cells with dysfunctional CII failed to accumulate ROS and underwent apoptosis in the presence of α-TOS. Similar resistance was observed when CybL was knocked down with siRNA.

Many advances have recently been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which plants take up and accumulate micronutrients such as iron. zinc. copper and manganese. Some of these mechanisms however. also facilitate the accumulation of non-essential toxic elements such as cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As). In humans. Cd and As intake has been associated with multiple disorders including kidney failure. diabetes. cancer and mental health issues. Recent studies have shown that some transporters can discriminate between essential metals and non-essential elements. Furthermore. sequestration of non-essential elements in roots has been described in several plant species as a key process limiting the translocation of non-essential elements to aboveground edible tissues. including seeds. Increasing the concentration of bioavailable micronutrients (biofortification) in grains while lowering the accumulation of non-essential elements will likely require the concerted action of several transporters. This review discusses the most recent advances on mineral nutrition that could be used to preferentially enrich seeds with micronutrients and also illustrates how precision breeding and transport engineering could be used to enhance the nutritional value of crops by re-routing essential and non-essential elements to separate sink tissues (roots and seeds).,True,7LaHkYgAAAAJ:Dmoar05iI2YC,65,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2014.00051/full,15471393942587854341,/scholar?cites=15471393942587854341,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2014.00051/full,0,0,0

As a legume. common bean also has the economic and environmental benefit of associating with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. thus reducing the use of synthetic fertilizers. which is key for sustainable agriculture. Despite significant advances in the plant nutrition field. the mechanisms underlying the adaptation of common bean to low nutrient input remains largely unknown. The recent release of the common bean genome offers. for the first time. the possibility of applying techniques and approaches that have been exclusive to model plants to study the adaptive responses of common bean to challenging environments. In this review. we discuss the hallmarks of common bean domestication and subsequent distribution around the globe. We also discuss recent advances in phosphate. iron. and zinc homeostasis. as these nutrients often limit plant growth. development and yield. In addition. iron and zinc are major targets of crop biofortification to improve human nutrition. Developing common bean varieties able to thrive under nutrient limiting conditions will have a major impact on human nutrition. particularly in countries where dry beans are the main source of carbohydrates. protein and minerals.,True,7LaHkYgAAAAJ:WgvcDLhf7hwC,47,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.00600/full,7627224676385679903,/scholar?cites=7627224676385679903,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.00600/full,0,0,0

These concentrations are strongly influenced by soil conditions. as shown here by quantifying the concentration of 14 elements in seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown under four different soil conditions: standard. or modified with NaCl. heavy metals. or alkali. Each of the modified soils resulted in a unique change to the seed ionome (the mineral nutrient content of the seeds). To help identify the genetic networks regulating the seed ionome. changes in elemental concentrations were evaluated using mutants corresponding to 760 genes as well as 10 naturally occurring accessions. The frequency of ionomic phenotypes supports an estimate that as much as 11% of the A. thaliana genome encodes proteins of functional relevance to ion homeostasis in seeds. A subset of mutants were analyzed with two independent alleles. providing five examples of genes important for regulation of the seed ionome: SOS2. ABH1. CCC. At3g14280 and CNGC2. In a comparison of nine different accessions to a Col-0 reference. eight accessions were observed to have reproducible differences in elemental concentrations. seven of which were dependent on specific soil conditions.

Contamination of soil and water by chromium (Cr) is of recent concern. Toxicity of Cr to plants depends on its valence state: Cr(VI) is highly toxic and mobile whereas Cr(III) is less toxic.

Plasmid genetic determinants for chromate resistance have been described in several bacterial genera. most notably in Pseudomonas. Resistance to chromate is associated with decreased chromate transport by the resistant cells. The genes for a hydrophobic polypeptide.

The high toxicity of arsenic derivatives converts this element in a serious problem of public health worldwide. There is a global arsenic geocycle in which microbes play a relevant role. Ancient exposure to arsenic derivatives. both inorganic and organic. has represented a selective pressure for microbes to evolve or acquire diverse arsenic resistance genetic systems. In addition. arsenic compounds appear to have been used as a toxin in chemical warfare for a long time selecting for an extended range of arsenic resistance determinants. Arsenic resistance strategies rely mainly on membrane transport pathways that extrude the toxic compounds from the cell cytoplasm. The ars operons. first discovered in bacterial R-factors almost 50 years ago. are the most common microbial arsenic resistance systems. Numerous ars operons. with a variety of genes and different combinations of them. populate the prokaryotic genomes. including their accessory plasmids. transposons. and genomic islands. Besides these canonical. widespread ars gene clusters. which confer resistance to the inorganic forms of arsenic. additional genes have been discovered recently. which broadens the spectrum of arsenic tolerance by detoxifying organic arsenic derivatives often used as toxins.

Testing biochemistry,2000,Bas Teusink and Jutta Passarge and Corinne A Reijenga and Eugenia Esgalhado and Coen C Van der Weijden and Mike Schepper and Michael C Walsh and Barbara M Bakker and Karel Van Dam and Hans V Westerhoff and Jacky L Snoep,267,,17,5313-5329,Blackwell Science Ltd,This paper examines whether the in vivo behavior of yeast glycolysis can be understood in terms of the in vitro kinetic properties of the constituent enzymes. In nongrowing. anaerobic. compressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae the values of the kinetic parameters of most glycolytic enzymes were determined. For the other enzymes appropriate literature values were collected. By inserting these values into a kinetic model for glycolysis. fluxes and metabolites were calculated. Under the same conditions fluxes and metabolite levels were measured.In our first model. branch reactions were ignored. This model failed to reach the stable steady state that was observed in the experimental flux measurements. Introduction of branches towards trehalose. glycogen. glycerol and succinate did allow such a steady state. The predictions of this branched model were compared with the empirical behavior.

In the resting state of respiration. nearly all control is exerted by the passive permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane to protons. In the intermediate states and even in the active state of respiration. control is distributed among different steps including the adenine nucleotide translocator and cytochrome c oxidase.

Yet. the challenge for biology overall is to understand how organisms function. By discovering how function arises in dynamic interactions. systems biology addresses the missing links between molecules and physiology. Top-down systems biology identifies molecular interaction networks on the basis of correlated molecular behavior observed in genome-wide ‘omics’ studies. Bottom-up systems biology examines the mechanisms through which functional properties arise in the interactions of known components.

The emerging picture is overwhelmingly complex. Molecules out of many parallel signal transduction pathways are involved. Their activities appear to be controlled by multiple factors.

We here develop a method to quantitate the relative contributions of metabolic and hierarchical regulation.

We developed a molecular genetic tool that specifically induces ATP hydrolysis in living cells without interfering with other aspects of metabolism. Genes encoding the F1 part of the membrane-bound (F1F0) H+-ATP synthase were expressed in steadily growing Escherichia coli cells. which lowered the intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] ratio. This resulted in a strong stimulation of the specific glycolytic flux concomitant with a smaller decrease in the growth rate of the cells. By optimizing additional ATP hydrolysis. we increased the flux through glycolysis to 1.7 times that of the wild-type flux. The results demonstrate why attempts in the past to increase the glycolytic flux through overexpression of glycolytic enzymes have been unsuccessful: the majority of flux control (>75%) resides not inside but outside the …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,340,https://jb.asm.org/content/184/14/3909.short,2586283591667975679,/scholar?cites=2586283591667975679,,https://jb.asm.org/content/jb/184/14/3909.full.pdf,0,0,0

Such a `turbo' principle is useful but also contains an inherent risk. This is illustrated by a detailed kinetic analysis of a paradoxical Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant; the mutant fails to grow on glucose because of overactive initial enzymes of glycolysis. but is defective only in an enzyme (trehalose 6-phosphate synthase) that appears to have little relevance to glycolysis. The ubiquity of pathways that possess an initial activation step. suggests that there might be many more genes that. when deleted. cause rather paradoxical regulation phenotypes (i.e. growth defects caused by enhanced utilization of growth substrate).,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,273,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000498012055,14119445763699419769,/scholar?cites=14119445763699419769,,http://arquivo.ufv.br/dbv/pgfvg/BVE684/htms/pdfs_revisao/metabolismo/dangerturbodesign.pdf,0,0,0

1224212,Why cytoplasmic signalling proteins should be recruited to cell membranes,2000,Boris N Kholodenko and Jan B Hoek and Hans V Westerhoff,10,,5,173-178,Elsevier Current Trends,It has been suggested that localization of signal-transduction proteins close to the cell membrane causes an increase in their rate of encounter after activation. We maintain that such an increase in the first-encounter rate is too small to be responsible for truly enhanced signal transduction. Instead. the function of membrane localization is to increase the number (or average lifetime) of complexes between cognate signal transduction proteins and hence increase the extent of activation of downstream processes. This is achieved by concentrating the proteins in the small volume of the area just below the plasma membrane. The signal-transduction chain is viewed simply as operating at low default intensity because one of its components is present at a low concentration. The steady signalling level of the chain is enhanced 1000-fold by increasing the concentration of that component.

Recently. it was shown that control of signalling cannot reside in a single gene product. and might well be dispersed over many components. Which of the reactions in these complex networks are most important. and how can the existing molecular information be used to understand why particular genes are oncogenes whereas others are not?

Here we show that PII. encoded by the glnB gene. is not always essential; for instance upon ammonia deprivation of a glnB deletion strain. glutamine synthetase can be deadenylylated as effectively as in the wild‐type strain. We describe a new operon. glnK amtB. which encodes a homologue of PII and a putative ammonia transporter. We cloned and overexpressed glnK and found that the expressed protein had almost the same molecular weight as PII. reacted with polyclonal PII antibody. and was 67% identical in terms of amino acid sequence with Escherichia coli PII.

They can be a part of the sample itself. or may be deliberately added to adapt the sample to a given technique. so that the desired property can be measured. In all cases. matrix effects must be taken into account for data interpretation. Therefore. the physical and the chemical interactions between the target compounds and the matrix during the excitation must be clearly understood. Mass spectrometry. on the contrary. until recently made no use of what is generally considered as a matrix. except perhaps in gas chromatography and chemical ionization in which the carrier or reactant gas is mixed with the samples.

Cette réflexion fait souvent fi de la mise en oeuvre de véritables stratégies motivationnelles. Pourtant. lorsqu'on demande à un enseignant pourquoi il souhaite mettre un cours en ligne. il invoque souvent le fait de chercher à motiver ses étudiants. Nous distinguerons ici le maintien de la motivation. du renforcement de la motivation des étudiants. Les risques de démotivation et d'abandon sont très nombreux dans l'enseignement à distance. même avec le soutien des nouvelles technologies. Il est donc essentiel de veiller à maintenir constamment la motivation initiale de l'apprenant. Si le maintien de cette motivation fait appel à des moyens. des trucs. des recettes de tutorat. il n'en va pas de même du renforcement de la motivation. En effet. il s' agit ici de mettre au point. dès la phase de conception du cours. de véritables stratégies motivationnelles.Quels sont les risques de démotivation des étudiants? Comment les éviter? Quelles bases théoriques peuvent nous guider dans notre mise au point des stratégies motivationnelles? Quelles pistes motivationnelles le concepteur peut-il emprunter. et dans quelles perspectives? Sur base des théories de la motivation. notre recension des données bibliographiques vise à préciser les questions que doivent se poser les concepteurs de cours à distance.

The aim of aeration was primarily to cool down the grain and then to prevent its deterioration by reducing the number of insects. In Belgium. the mild winters enable insects to survive to the next season. In autumn. the progressive lowering of temperature has an acclimation effect on stored-product insects. The present study was undertaken to determine the survival at low temperatures of non cold-acclimated and laboratory-and field-cold-acclimated insects.

To assess the field-cold-acclimation in autumn and in winter. insects were monthly taken from a bin and transferred to 5 degrees C for 6 weeks. S. granarius adults were more cold-hardy than O. surinamensis. but O. surinamensis adults compensated their cold-sensibility by a great ability to acclimate.

The ability of metallophytes to tolerate extreme metal concentrations commends them for revegetation of mines and metal‐contaminated sites. Metallophytes can also be exploited in environmental technologies. for example. phytostabilization. phytoremediation. and phytomining.

Cobalt accumulation is also observed in a limited number of nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator plants occurring on ultramafic soils around the world. None of the putative Cu or Co hyperaccumulator plants appears to comply with the fundamental principle of hyperaccumulation. as foliar Cu–Co accumulation is strongly dose‐dependent.

Hyperaccumulators are confined exclusively to the Copper Belt of Zaïre/Zambia and number 15 cobaltophytes and 12 cuprophytes.

Zaïre. About 4O% of the cobalt and copper was extractable into deionized water and a further 4O% was extractable in 0.2M hydrochloric acid. It was concluded that copper and cobalt are bound to several different ligands instead of a single ligand as in the case of nickel hyperaccumulators. Proton microprobe studies on the cobalt accumulator Haumaniastrum robertii showed a strong inverse correlation between the spatial distributions of cobalt and potassium. as well as a direct relationship between cobalt and calcium.

The Hague/Kluwer Academic Publishers,Pot trials were carried out on plants ofHaumaniastrum katangense. Haumaniastrum robertii andAeolanthus biformifolius. These metallophytes from Zaïre were grown in substrates containing from 0–10.000 μg/g (0–1%) copper or cobalt. The tolerance of each species was determined and for cobalt was highest inH. robertii (4000 μg/g) and for copper was highest inAeolanthus biformifolius (9000 μg/g). Discontinuities in the plant-soil curves for each element indicate an exclusion mechanism operating for all three species at lower concentrations of the element in the soil. All species would grow in soils containing only traces of cobalt or copper and this indicated that uptake of heavy metals was not linked to a physiological requirement for either element.

The expression of MN protein in HeLa cells is regulated by cell density. In HeLa x fibroblast cell hybrids its expression correlates with tumorigenicity. Using a specific monoclonal antibody we have identified a cDNA clone coding for MN. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed strong structural homology between the central region of the MN protein and carbonic anhydrases (CA). MN sequence retains the conserved zinc-binding site as well as the enzyme's active center. In accord with these findings. MN protein from HeLa cells was found to bind zinc and to have carbonic anhydrase activity. The N-terminal region of MN shares some similarity with DNA binding proteins of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family. and the protein was found to have affinity for DNA by DNA-cellulose chromatography. The region between the CA-like domain and the putative HLH domain is rich in imperfect repeats of serine. proline. glycine and acidic residues with few hydrophobic amino acids. resembling thus an activation region of transcription factors. The fact that MN protein is detectable in several types of human carcinomas. but not in corresponding non-cancerous tissues. suggests its possible role in neoplasia.

Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is known to thrive principally in shrubby and arboreal habitats. This study focuses on the occurrence of this exotic species and its seasonal abundance in various field crops. The abundance of adults. larvae and pupae of H. axyridis was evaluated over a three-year period. from 2009 to 2011. in four important agronomical crops (wheat. corn. broad bean and potato) in Belgium. From May to September. 48 1-m² quadrats were visually inspected in each of the fields sampled on several farms every seven days. H. axyridis colonized and reproduced in all of the four crops studied. with the largest numbers recorded in corn and broad bean crops. Larvae and adults of H. axyridis were recorded mainly in corn and to a much less extent in wheat and potato crops.

Harmonia axyridis (Pallas). native to Asia. is an invasive species in many European and American countries. Initially introduced as a biological control agent against aphids and coccids in greenhouses. this alien species rapidly invaded many habitats such as forests. meadows. wetlands. and agricultural crops. This paper reviews the habitats (forests. crops. herbs. gardens and orchards) where H. axyridis has been observed. either during insect samplings or as part of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs. Studies have referenced H. axyridis on 106 plant taxa (35 arboreal species. 21 crop species. 27 herbaceous species. 11 ornamental species. and 12 orchard species) and have identified 89 plant-prey relationships (34 arboreal species. 16 crop species. 13 herbaceous species. 10 ornamental species. and 16 orchard species) in different countries. Harmonia axyridis is more abundant in forest areas. principally on Acer. Salix. Tilia and Quercus. than in agroecosystems.

These species can cause economical and ecological damages. The Multicoloured Asian ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Pallas)(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is one of these species which was intentionally introduced for biological control and has spread from its native range in Central and Eastern Asia to large parts of North and South America. Europe and Africa. The decline of native species is linked to the spread and the aggressive behaviour of H. axyridis. The objective of this thesis is the evaluation of aphid's predator population densities and predator diversities. with a special focus on H. axyridis in agroecosystems in Wallonia. in the South of Belgium. First. field crops preferences of H. axyridis were determined. Later aphid's predator population changes during time were evaluated.

H. axyridis numbers were found to increase over the first four inventoried year. reaching in 2012 86% for adult stage (119. 7±7. 8 adults/100m2) and 76% for larvae stages (242. 8±14. 2 larvae/100m2) of the aphid predators. while in 2009 these ratios were 14% and 23% respectively. For C. septempunctata and P. quatuordecimpunctata the population densities decrease at the end of the five years period. Population densities of C. carnea and E. balteatus were variable during the sampling period but increased in 2013.

Harmonia axyridis Pallas in Belgian corn,2014,Axel Vandereycken and Bérénice Fassotte and Fanny Barsics and Delphine Durieux and Emilie Joie and Frédéric Francis and Eric Haubruge and François Verheggen,,,,,,[en] Several insect species are known to have different morphotypes. an adaptation to heterogeneities in changing environments. This phenotypic plasticity could be a factor used by the Multicoloured Asian Ladybird. which is considered as an invasive species in Europe since its introduction in the 80’s. Harmonia axyridis has four major morphotypes: 2 melanic forms. conspicua and spectabilis; and 2 non-melanic. succinea and axyridis. In Belgium. only the three first are observed. Literature reports variations in morphotype frequencies. across native and introduced strains. These variations seem to be linked to climate (geographical and seasonal variation). with non-melanic forms being the most abundant in hot and arid climate.This study focused on the variation of morphotype abundance in H. axyridis according to season. field and gender. Adult ladybirds were caught from mid-July to mid-October 2012 into 5 corn fields. The proportions of observed morphotypes were compared according to the sampling season. The abundance of morphotypes was not significantly different through the fields; the observed ratios were 81.6%. 15% and 3.4% for succinea. spectabilis and conspicua respectively. Succinea was the most observed morphotype (χ2= 755.8; P< 0.001). The total number of collected males and females was the same with ratios of 48.2% and 51.8%:(χ2= 0.93; P= 0.33). The sex ratio was also not significantly different for each morphotype. There was no evolution of melanic and non-melanic form ratio according to the season. with 25.6% of melanic form in summer and 20.6% in autumn (χ2= 1.22; P= 0.27).

Ltd.,While extensive research has examined plant defense responses to attack by herbivores and pathogens. plant responses to parasitism by other plants are not well characterized. The expression of induced plant defenses is mediated by complex signaling networks in which the plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) play key roles. In general. JA‐mediated signaling pathways are implicated in the regulation of antiherbivore defenses. while the SA pathway is associated with defense responses against pathogens. However. there are many exceptions to this basic framework. and recent work suggests that interactions between the JA and SA pathways may play important roles in fine‐tuning defense responses. The few studies that have addressed plant responses to parasitism by other plants suggest that both salicylates and jasmonates can mediate effective defenses.

The increasing probability of land cover mixtures with decreasing resolution is defined as heterogeneity. which is a key concept in scaling studies. The effect of pixel heterogeneity on spectral reflectances and LAI retrievals is investigated with 1-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data aggregated to different coarse spatial resolutions.

Vietnam,2014,V Tran Thi and A Tien Thi Xuan and H Phan Nguyen and F Dahdouh-Guebas and N Koedam,11,Biogeosciences,14,3781-3795,Copernicus GmbH, Mui Ca Mau at the southern tip of Vietnam supports a large area of mangroves and has a high value for biodiversity and scenic beauty. This area is affected by erosion along the East Sea and accretion along the Gulf of Thailand. leading to the loss of huge stretches of mangroves along the East Sea and. in some cases. loss of environmental and ecosystem services provided by mangroves. In this study. we used remotely sensed aerial (1953). Landsat (1979. 1988 and 2000) and SPOT (1992. 1995. 2004. 2008. 2009 and 2011) images and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to quantify the rate of mangrove shoreline change for a 58 yr period. There were 1129 transects sampled at 100 m intervals along the mangrove shoreline and two statistical methods. namely end point rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR). were used to calculate the rate of change of mangrove shorelines and distance from 1953 to 2011. The study confirms that erosion and accretion. respectively. are significant at the East Sea and Gulf of Thailand sides of Mui Ca Mau. The East Sea side had a mean erosion LRR of 33.24 m yr−1. The accretion trend at the Gulf of Thailand side had an average rate of 40.65 m yr−1.

Sitobion avenae. Aphid natural enemies. such as the marmalade hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus and the multicolored Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis. eavesdrop on aphid chemical communication and utilize (E)-ß-farnesene as a kairomone to localize their immediate or offspring preys. These aphid-predator systems are important models to study how the olfactory systems of distant insect taxa process the same chemical signal. We postulated that odorant-binding proteins (OBPs). which are highly expressed in insect olfactory tissues and involved in the first step of odorant reception. have conserved regions involved in binding (E)-ß-farnesene.   Methodology We cloned OBP genes from the English grain aphid and two major predators of this aphid species. We then expressed these proteins and compare their binding affinities to the alarm pheromone/kairomone. By using a fluorescence reporter. we tested binding of (E)-ß-farnesene and other electrophysiologically and behaviorally active compounds. including a green leaf volatile attractant.

Recent research shows that male ejaculate expenditure is dynamic in both time and space. and that males are sensitive to risks of sperm competition and can vary ejaculate size accordingly.

Here we present a comparative study whose aim is to investigate the effect of relative intensity of sperm competition on investment in spermatogenesis and the number and size of sperm produced. We find that both the gonadosomatic index (GSI = [gonad weight/body weight] x 100) and sperm numbers increase with intensity of sperm competition across species but that sperm length decreases. These new findings are consistent with a raffle‐based mode of sperm competition in fishes.

The relation between sperm competition intensity and sperm expenditure can be radically different across species from that within a species. Across species. the average ejaculate expenditure will increase with the average intensity of sperm competition. But within a species. the reverse trend is generally predicted for greater than two males competing for the same set of eggs. These effects are demonstrated with three sperm competition game models.

Such differences in mating advantage generate asymmetries in risk of sperm competition between the male strategies. Theoretical sperm competition models predict that males typically mating in disfavoured roles (here. the parr strategy) should be selected to offset this disadvantage by investing more into spermatogenesis to achieve fertilization success.

Accordingly. sperm have evolved to function in a non‐self environment (in contrast to somatic cells) and sperm morphometry is predicted to be optimized independently of the individual male producing them. but is the result of selective forces arising directly from the fertilization and competitive environment in which sperm will operate.

Male and female reproductive optima invariably differ because the potential reproductive rate of males almost always exceeds that of females: females are selected to maximize mate ‘quality’. while males can increase fitness through mate ‘quantity’. A dynamic. sexually selected conflict therefore exists in which ‘competitive’ males are selected to override the preference tactics evolved by ‘choosy’ females. The wide variation across taxa in mating systems therefore generates variance in the outcome of intrasexual conflict and the strength of sexual selection: monandry constrains reproductive heterozygosity and allows female choice to select and maintain particular (preferred) genes; polyandry promotes reproductive heterozygosity and will more likely override female choice.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1459,2333-2337,The Royal Society,There is increasing evidence that normal male reproductive function can be disrupted by exposure to pollutants in the environment that can exogenously mimic. antagonize or block sex–hormone function. One possible consequence of exposure to these xenobiotics is disruption to spermatogenesis. but results thus far provide only indirect and inconsistent evidence. In this study we exposed adult male guppies (Poeciliidae: Teleostei) to environmentally relevant levels of the common xenobiotics tributyltin (11.2–22.3 ng l–1) and bisphenol A (274–549 μg l–1) in experimental aquaria. After 21 days of exposure. we found significant declines (by 40–75%) in total sperm counts for male fishes exposed to tributyltin and bisphenol A compared with controls. This short–term decline in sperm count is unlikely to be the result of endocrine–mediated alteration of the germ line. and we found no change in testis size or sperm …,True,jZN3u4IAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,128,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2000.1288,12962840798027964398,/scholar?cites=12962840798027964398,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1690805/pdf/11413652.pdf,0,0,0

The ability to tailor responses to the presence of rivals allows males to increase investment in reproduction only when necessary. This is important given that reproduction imposes costs [2] that limit male reproductive capacity. particularly when sperm competition occurs [3. 4]. Fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) males exposed to rivals subsequently mate for longer and thus accrue fitness benefits under increased competition [5]. in line with theory [6. 7]. Here. we show that male D. melanogaster detect rivals by using a suite of cues and that the resulting responses lead directly to significant fitness benefits. We used multiple techniques to systematically remove auditory. olfactory. tactile. and visual cues. first singly and then in all possible combinations.

In the absence of a known cause. this syndrome was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive epizootiological study in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD.  Methods and Principal Findings Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology. pathogen loads. and pesticide levels). no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations. suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies.  Conclusions/Significance This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. We present evidence that this condition is contagious or the result of exposure to a common risk factor. Potentially important areas for future hypothesis-driven research. including the possible legacy effect of mite parasitism and the role of honey bee resistance to pesticides. are highlighted.,True,PR9Y-isAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1245,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006481,6031503547857267375,/scholar?cites=6031503547857267375,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006481,0,0,0

Domesticated honey bees face numerous pests and pathogens. tempting hypotheses that colony collapses arise from exposure to new or resurgent pathogens. Here we explore the incidence and abundance of currently known honey bee pathogens in colonies suffering from Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). otherwise weak colonies. and strong colonies from across the United States. Although pathogen identities differed between the eastern and western United States. there was a greater incidence and abundance of pathogens in CCD colonies. Pathogen loads were highly covariant in CCD but not control hives. suggesting that CCD colonies rapidly become susceptible to a diverse set of pathogens. or that co-infections can act synergistically to produce the rapid depletion of workers that characterizes the disorder. We also tested workers from a CCD-free apiary to confirm that significant positive correlations among pathogen loads can develop at the level of individual bees and not merely as a secondary effect of CCD. This observation and other recent data highlight pathogen interactions as important components of bee disease. Finally. we used deep RNA sequencing to further characterize microbial diversity in CCD and non-CCD hives. We identified novel strains of the recently described Lake Sinai viruses (LSV) and found evidence of a shift in gut bacterial composition that may be a biomarker of CCD.

The two important measures of a queen's mating number are her actual number of mates and her effective number of mates. Estimating the effective number of mates is mathematically identical to the problem of estimating the effective number of alleles in population genetics. a common measure of genetic variability introduced by Kimura & Crow (1964). We derive a new bias‐corrected estimator of effective number of types (mates or alleles) and compare this new method to previous methods for estimating true and effective numbers of types using Monte Carlo simulations.

Apis mellifera. colonies replace their queens by constructing many queen cells and then eliminating supernumerary queens until only one remains. The ages of the queens and the variation in their reproductive potential are important factors in the outcome of such events. Selection would favour colonies that requeen as quickly as possible to minimize the brood hiatus. therefore selecting for queens reared from older larvae. Conversely. reproductive potential (queen ‘quality’) is maximized by rearing queens from younger larvae. This potential trade-off was tested during two phases of queen replacement. namely queen rearing and polygyny reduction. Our results suggest that queen age is a significant element during both queen rearing and polygyny reduction. whereas queen quality. at least to the magnitude tested in this experiment. has little impact on the outcome of either process.

1224479,Effects of insemination quantity on honey bee queen physiology,2007,Freddie-Jeanne Richard and David R Tarpy and Christina M Grozinger,2,PloS one,10,e980,Public Library of Science,Mating has profound effects on the physiology and behavior of female insects. and in honey bee (Apis mellifera) queens. these changes are permanent. Queens mate with multiple males during a brief period in their early adult lives. and shortly thereafter they initiate egg-laying. Furthermore. the pheromone profiles of mated queens differ from those of virgins. and these pheromones regulate many different aspects of worker behavior and colony organization. While it is clear that mating causes dramatic changes in queens. it is unclear if mating number has more subtle effects on queen physiology or queen-worker interactions; indeed. the effect of multiple matings on female insect physiology has not been broadly addressed. Because it is not possible to control the natural mating behavior of queens. we used instrumental insemination and compared queens inseminated with semen from either a single drone (single-drone inseminated. or SDI) or 10 drones (multi-drone inseminated. or MDI). We used observation hives to monitor attraction of workers to SDI or MDI queens in colonies. and cage studies to monitor the attraction of workers to virgin.

In the absence of a known cause. this syndrome was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive epizootiological study in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD.  Methods and Principal Findings Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology. pathogen loads. and pesticide levels). no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations. suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies.  Conclusions/Significance This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors.

1224491,Four common pesticides. their mixtures and a formulation solvent in the hive environment have high oral toxicity to honey bee larvae,2014,Wanyi Zhu and Daniel R Schmehl and Christopher A Mullin and James L Frazier,9,PloS one,1,e77547,Public Library of Science,Recently. the widespread distribution of pesticides detected in the hive has raised serious concerns about pesticide exposure on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health. A larval rearing method was adapted to assess the chronic oral toxicity to honey bee larvae of the four most common pesticides detected in pollen and wax - fluvalinate. coumaphos. chlorothalonil. and chloropyrifos - tested alone and in all combinations. All pesticides at hive-residue levels triggered a significant increase in larval mortality compared to untreated larvae by over two fold. with a strong increase after 3 days of exposure. Among these four pesticides. honey bee larvae were most sensitive to chlorothalonil compared to adults. Synergistic toxicity was observed in the binary mixture of chlorothalonil with fluvalinate at the concentrations of 34 mg/L and 3 mg/L. respectively; whereas. when diluted by 10 fold. the interaction switched to antagonism. Chlorothalonil at 34 mg/L was also found to synergize the miticide coumaphos at 8 mg/L.

1224492,What have pesticides got to do with it?,2008,Maryann Frazier and Chris Mullin and Jim Frazier and Sara Ashcraft,148,American Bee Journal,6,521-524,[Hamilton. Ill.: Dadant & Sons]. 1861-,There is agreement among beekeepers and scientists that the health of honey bees has been in decline for years. and the rate of decline appears to be accelerating. A 2007 survey estimated a loss of about 1/3 of US honey bee colonies during the winter of’06-’07 (vanEngelsdorp et al. 2007). It is generally agreed that varroa mites are playing a key role in the demise of honey bee health; additionally. the interaction between diseases and varroa and the newly identified Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) are likely important contributing factors (Cox-Foster et al.. 2007). However. the past year’s research into the newest malady. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). supports an emerging hypothesis that no one factor alone is responsible for the dramatic losses of honey bees in general or CCD specifically.A 2007 publication by the National Academy of Sciences documents a decline in many North American pollinators (Committee on the Status of Pollinators in North America. 2007). Another study published in the journal Science documented a loss not only of pollinators in Great Britain and the Netherlands. but also in the plants that are dependent on them for pollination (Biesmeijer et al. 2006). Clearly the phenomenon of pollinator decline is not limited to honey bees or to the US and the consequences are far reaching for agriculture and our food supply.,True,hfVjkzUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,161,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jim-Frazier/publication/242418397_What_Have_Pesticides_Got_to_Do_with_It/links/55928f7908ae5af2b0eb32a3/What-Have-Pesticides-Got-to-Do-with-It.pdf,11488906188541352230,/scholar?cites=11488906188541352230,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jim-Frazier/publication/242418397_What_Have_Pesticides_Got_to_Do_with_It/links/55928f7908ae5af2b0eb32a3/What-Have-Pesticides-Got-to-Do-with-It.pdf,0,0,0

Important structural features for inhibition include two hydrophobic moieties preferably orientating in a trans manner from an electrophilic center such as an activated olefin or epoxide. with the epoxide giving maximal activity. Synthesis of chalcone oxide derivatives bearing a single p-substituent on either phenyl ring has led to very potent inhibitors of the enzyme. the best being 4-phenylchalcone oxide (50% inhibition at 6.4 × 10−8m).

Apis mellifera (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Japanese orchard bees. Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). The pesticides were acetamiprid (Assail 30SG). λ-cyhalothrin (Warrior II). dimethoate (Dimethoate 4EC). phosmet (Imidan 70W). and imidacloprid (Provado 1.6F). At least 5 doses of each chemical. diluted in distilled water. were applied to freshly-eclosed adult bees. Mortality was assessed after 48 hr. Dose-mortality regressions were analyzed by probit analysis to test the hypotheses of parallelism and equality by likelihood ratio tests. For A. mellifera. the decreasing order of toxicity at LD50 was imidacloprid. λ-cyhalothrin. dimethoate. phosmet. and acetamiprid. For O. cornifrons. the decreasing order of toxicity at LD50 was dimethoate. λ-cyhalothrin. imidacloprid. acetamiprid. and phosmet. Interaction of imidacloprid or acetamiprid with the fungicide fenbuconazole (Indar 2F) was also tested in a 1∶1 proportion for each species. Estimates of response parameters for each mixture component applied to each species were compared with dose-response data for each mixture in statistical tests of the hypothesis of independent joint action. For each mixture. the interaction of fenbuconazole (a material non-toxic to both species) was significant and positive along the entire line for the pesticide.

The adjuvants themselves are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are therefore subject to minimal scrutiny and toxicological testing by regulatory agencies. Honey bees are exposed to a wide array of pesticides as they conduct normal foraging operations. meaning that they are likely exposed to spray adjuvants as well. It was previously unknown whether these agrochemicals have any deleterious effects on honey bee behavior.   Methodology/Principal Findings An improved. automated version of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay with a high degree of trial-to-trial reproducibility was used to measure the olfactory learning ability of honey bees treated orally with sublethal doses of the most widely used spray adjuvants on almonds in the Central Valley of California. Three different adjuvant classes (nonionic surfactants. crop oil concentrates. and organosilicone surfactants) were investigated in this study. Learning was impaired after ingestion of 20 µg organosilicone surfactant. indicating harmful effects on honey bees caused by agrochemicals previously believed to be innocuous. Organosilicones were more active than the nonionic adjuvants. while the crop oil concentrates were inactive. Ingestion was required for the tested adjuvant to have an effect on learning. as exposure via antennal contact only induced no level of impairment.

Lack of disclosure of adjuvant and formulation ingredients coupled with a lack of adequate analytical methods constrains the assessment of total chemical load on beneficial organisms and the environment. Adjuvants generally enhance the pesticidal efficacy and inadvertently the non-target effects of the active ingredient. Spray adjuvants are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are not registered by the USA EPA. leaving their regulation and monitoring to individual states. Organosilicone surfactants are the most potent adjuvants and super-penetrants available to growers. Based on the California Department of Pesticide Regulation data for agrochemical applications to almonds. there has been increasing use of adjuvants. particularly organosilicone surfactants. during bloom when two-thirds of USA honey bee colonies are present. Increased tank-mixing of these with ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors and other fungicides. and with insect growth regulator insecticides may be associated with recent USA honey bee declines. This database archives every application of a spray tank adjuvant with detail that is unprecedented globally.

In the absence of a known cause. this syndrome was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive epizootiological study in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD.  Methods and Principal Findings Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology. pathogen loads. and pesticide levels). no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations. suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies.  Conclusions/Significance This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. We present evidence that this condition is contagious or the result of exposure to a common risk factor.

Domesticated honey bees face numerous pests and pathogens. tempting hypotheses that colony collapses arise from exposure to new or resurgent pathogens. Here we explore the incidence and abundance of currently known honey bee pathogens in colonies suffering from Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). otherwise weak colonies. and strong colonies from across the United States. Although pathogen identities differed between the eastern and western United States. there was a greater incidence and abundance of pathogens in CCD colonies. Pathogen loads were highly covariant in CCD but not control hives. suggesting that CCD colonies rapidly become susceptible to a diverse set of pathogens. or that co-infections can act synergistically to produce the rapid depletion of workers that characterizes the disorder. We also tested workers from a CCD-free apiary to confirm that significant positive correlations among pathogen loads can develop at the level of individual bees and not merely as a secondary effect of CCD. This observation and other recent data highlight pathogen interactions as important components of bee disease. Finally. we used deep RNA sequencing to further characterize microbial diversity in CCD and non-CCD hives.

Queens and workers are alternative forms of the adult female honey bee and represent one of the best known examples of insect polyphenism. Hormonal regulation of caste determination in honey bees has been studied in detail. but little is known about the proximate molecular mechanisms underlying this process. or any other such polyphenism. We report the success of a molecular-genetic approach for studying queen- and worker-specific gene expression in the development of the honey bee (Apis mellifera).

Apis mellifera. are currently affected by abrupt depopulation during winter and many factors are suspected to be involved. either alone or in combination. Parasites and pathogens are considered as principal actors. in particular the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor. associated viruses and the microsporidian Nosema ceranae. Here we used long term monitoring of colonies and screening for eleven disease agents and genes involved in bee immunity and physiology to identify predictive markers of honeybee colony losses during winter. The data show that DWV. Nosema ceranae. Varroa destructor and Vitellogenin can be predictive markers for winter colony losses. but their predictive power strongly depends on the season.

Apis mellifera,2006,Yanping Chen and Jay Evans and Mark Feldlaufer,92,,3,152-159,Academic Press,The most crucial stage in the dynamics of virus infections is the mode of virus transmission. In general. transmission of viruses can occur through two pathways: horizontal and vertical transmission. In horizontal transmission. viruses are transmitted among individuals of the same generation. while vertical transmission occurs from mothers to their offspring. Because of its highly organized social structure and crowded population density. the honey bee colony represents a risky environment for the spread of disease infection. Like other plant and animal viruses. bee viruses use different survival strategies. including utilization of both horizontal and vertical routes. to transmit and maintain levels in a host population. In this review. we explore the current knowledge about the honey bee viruses and transmission routes of bee viruses.

As only a few Metazoan genomes are approaching finished quality (human. mouse. fly and worm). there is room for improvement of most genome assemblies. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) genome. published in 2006. was noted for its bimodal GC content distribution that affected the quality of the assembly in some regions and for fewer genes in the initial gene set (OGSv1.0) compared to what would be expected based on other sequenced insect genomes. Here. we report an improved honey bee genome assembly (Amel_4.5) with a new gene annotation set (OGSv3.2). and show that the honey bee genome contains a number of genes similar to that of other insect genomes. contrary to what was suggested in OGSv1.0. The new genome assembly is more contiguous and complete and the new gene set includes ~5000 more protein-coding genes. 50% more than previously reported. About 1/6 of the additional genes were due to improvements to the assembly. and the remaining were inferred based on new RNAseq and protein data. Lessons learned from this genome upgrade have important implications for future genome sequencing projects.

Components of the innate immune system are hardly known in this insect. which is in a key phylogenetic position to inform us about genetic innovations accompanying the evolution of holometabolous insects. We have annotated immunity-related genes and compared them with homologous molecules from other species. Around 300 candidate defense proteins are identified based on sequence similarity to homologs known to participate in immune responses. In most cases. paralog counts are lower than those of Drosophila melanogaster or Anopheles gambiae but are substantially higher than those of Apis mellifera. The genome contains probable orthologs for nearly all members of the Toll. IMD. and JAK/STAT pathways. While total numbers of the clip-domain serine proteinases are approximately equal in the fly (29). mosquito (32) and beetle (30). lineage-specific expansion of the family is discovered in all three species. Sixteen of the thirty-one serpin genes form a large cluster in a 50 kb region that resulted from extensive gene duplications. Among the nine Toll-like proteins. four are orthologous to Drosophila Toll. The presence of scavenger receptors and other related proteins indicates a role of cellular responses in the entire system.

We determined if the collection of resins. complex plant secretions with diverse antimicrobial properties. acts as a colony‐level immune defense by honey bees. Exposure to extracts from two sources of honey bee propolis (a mixture of resins and wax) led to a significantly lowered expression of two honey bee immune‐related genes (hymenoptaecin and AmEater in Brazilian and Minnesota propolis. respectively) and to lowered bacterial loads in the Minnesota (MN) propolis treated colonies.

Honey bee declines could reflect increased pressures from parasites and pathogens. The incidence of the microsporidian pathogen Nosema ceranae has increased significantly in the past decade. Here we present a draft assembly (7.86 MB) of the N. ceranae genome derived from pyrosequence data. including initial gene models and genomic comparisons with other members of this highly derived fungal lineage. N. ceranae has a strongly AT-biased genome (74% A+T) and a diversity of repetitive elements. complicating the assembly. Of 2.614 predicted protein-coding sequences. we conservatively estimate that 1.366 have homologs in the microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi. the most closely related published genome sequence. We identify genes conserved among microsporidia that lack clear homology outside this group. which are of special interest as potential virulence factors in this group of obligate parasites. A substantial fraction of the diminutive N. ceranae proteome consists of novel and transposable-element proteins.

In the absence of a known cause. this syndrome was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive epizootiological study in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD.  Methods and Principal Findings Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology. pathogen loads. and pesticide levels). no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations. suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies.  Conclusions/Significance This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. We present evidence that this condition is contagious or the result of exposure to a common risk factor.

In non-treatment bees. varroa parasitization combined with increased viral levels altered survivorship curves from long-survival to shorter-survival types. After challenge with live Escherichia coli. the survivorship of mite-parasitized bees was significantly lower than mite-free bees. Deformed-wing. mite-parasitized bees died on average within 1 day. even without E. coli challenge. This was correlated with the absence of an important enzyme activity in insect immunity. phenol oxidase. lacking even in those bees challenged with immuno-elicitors.

Since fall 2006. honey bees in the U.S. have faced a serious population decline. due in part to a phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). which is a disease syndrome that is likely caused by several factors. Data from an initial study in which investigators compared pathogens in honey bees affected by CCD suggested a putative role for Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus. IAPV. This is a single stranded RNA virus with no DNA stage placed taxonomically within the family Dicistroviridae. Although subsequent studies have failed to find IAPV in all CCD diagnosed colonies. IAPV has been shown to cause honey bee mortality. RNA interference technology (RNAi) has been used successfully to silence endogenous insect (including honey bee) genes both by injection and feeding. Moreover. RNAi was shown to prevent bees from succumbing to infection from IAPV under laboratory conditions. In the current study IAPV specific homologous dsRNA was used in the field. under natural beekeeping conditions in order to prevent mortality and improve the overall health of bees infected with IAPV. This controlled study included a total of 160 honey bee hives in two discrete climates. seasons and geographical locations (Florida and Pennsylvania). To our knowledge. this is the first successful large-scale real world use of RNAi for disease control.,True,p3nOyO8AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,192,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001160,3206386802614290091,/scholar?cites=3206386802614290091,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001160,0,0,0

The dynamics of accumulation differed between the 3 congeners tested. By subcellular fractionation of primary adipocytes. we demonstrate that these pollutants were almost exclusively recovered within the lipid droplet fraction and practically not associated to cell membranes. The absence of caveolin-1 expression in primary adipocytes from cav-1 deficient mice did not modify lipid droplet selective targeting of PCBs. In cav-1 KO MEF differentiated adipocytes. PCB accumulation was decreased. which correlated with reduced cell triglyceride content.

The production and chitin content of Daphnia magna Straus. the dominant species of the zooplanktonic community (by number and biomass). were assessed over the same period. From December to February. the microcrustacean biomass was low. varying from 0.035 to 0.440 gm-2. High biomass values were observed in April and June (about 4.3 gm-2) as a consequence of phytoplankton blooms and an increase in temperature. In November. despite the scarcity of algal food. the Daphnia magna biomass peaked up to 5.5 gm-2 due to the ability of these organisms to use bacteria and detritus for food.

The usage of PIC for water treatment has many challenges which are related to the well-drained nature of highly porous filters and the corresponding increase in hydraulic conductivity (shorter contact time). In this article. the extent of (i) iron exhaustion and (ii) porosity loss in four filtration systems are critically discussed. The considered filtration systems are:(i) Fe 0 alone.(ii) PIC alone.(iii) Fe 0/sand and (iv) Fe 0/pumice. In all four systems. mono-sized granular spherical particles are assumed. Sand and Fe 0 are compact (f= 0%) whereas PIC and pumice are porous (eg f= 40%). Results demonstrated that under anoxic conditions (Fe 3 O 4 as major corrosion products) Fe 0 depletion is possible in all systems except Fe 0 alone. Under oxic conditions (eg formation of Fe (OH) 3). the PIC system exhibited the highest level of Fe 0 depletion (58%). The increasing order of sustainability was: Fe 0< Fe 0/sand< Fe 0/PM< PIC.

A special culture vessel made it possible to simulate a one‐dimensional macroscopic rhizosphere by developing a root mat on a polyamide net. This root mat was laid down on a mica‐agar substrate that was cut into slices 0.5 mm thick (parallel to the root mat) after 1. 2. 3. and 4 d of contact. The phlogopite mica was the sole source of both K and Mg for the plants. Whereas there was no significant release of Mg as a consequence of the roots' activity. K was released and concomitantly the mica lattice expanded after 3 d of continuous exposure to the root mat. in response to K uptake by plants. After 4 d. the vermiculitization of the phlogopite was detectable up to 1.5 mm from the root surface (i.e.. the root mat) by x‐ray diffractometry.

The model takes into account ammonification. nitrification. and immobilization; and predicts that the 15N/14N ratios of nitrate and ammonium ion depend in part upon the ratio of the rates of immobilization and ammonification. The ratio of the rates of immobilization to nitrification under field conditions is unlikely to be the same as under the conditions of laboratory incubation experiments. Therefore. this prediction provides a possible explanation for differences observed between the 15N/14N ratio of nitrate extracted from soil cores and that of nitrate released during laboratory incubation of the same soils.The model described is ammenable to experimental test.

This study assesses the phosphate and organic phosphorus removal capacity of an iron oxide–gypsum compound (named OX) in batch trials. Phosphate solutions ranging from 0.001 to 10 mg P l−1 were tested and OX proved to be an effective fixing agent. Solutions with different ionic strengths did not affect this reactivity. Phosphate removal was not altered by pH values between 4 and 8. but increased significantly with higher values. Near-completion of this reaction was observed after some minutes. The combined effects of precipitation with calcium (gypsum) and sorption onto the oxide explain these interesting properties. The phosphate removal capacity was demonstrated on field samples.

These soil clays. which differ mainly in their contents of halloysite and kaolinite. represent the types of secondary constituents characteristic of different weathering stages in soils derived from such volcanic materials under humid tropical conditions. On these clays. Ca2+-K+ exchange equilibria were performed at pH 6 and 0.01 N chloride concentration. The amounts of K+ specific sites were estimated through a two-site modelling of the exchange isotherm curves. The total and external surface areas of the clays were measured by EGME retention and by the BET treatment of the N 2 adsorption isotherm. respectively. Relative halloysite content was found to be directly related to all measured surface charge properties. ie CEC. amount of K+ specific sites. and total and internal surface areas. It was also observed that thermal collapse of halloysitic layers reduced both the CEC and the amount of K+ specific sites. All the surface properties observed point to the presence of smectite units intimately associated with halloysite in these clays. The results further suggest that the layer charge of these smectite units differs in different samples.Hydrated halloysites are clay minerals that are widespread in soils derived from pyroclastic materials.

The downward movement of dolomite. kieserite and a mixture of CaCO3 and kieserite was investigated by monitoring the leachates and exchangeable cation composition from single and combined horizon columns. reconstructed from an acid brown forest soil profile (0–15 cm). Upon entering the soil. Mg ions from kieserite displaced base cations and acidity (H and Al ions) from exchange sites. which subsequently moved down with the mobile SO4 2− anions. Total leaching during the initial SO4 2− pulse was similar with the CaCO3 + kieserite mixture. Compared to the single kieserite treatment. the joint application of CaCO3 greatly increased the proportion of Ca in the leachates from all horizons.

Nevertheless. the long-term evolution of these effects is unknown and of critical importance because biochar persists in soil for centuries. We selected nine charcoal kiln sites (CKS) from forest (4 sites) and cropland (5 sites) and determined microbial properties of their topsoil. largely enriched with charcoal for > 150 years. Adjacent soils were used as references unaffected by charcoal production. Soils were incubated in controlled conditions and emissions of CO2 were measured during 138 days. At day 68. an aliquot was sampled from each soil to determine microbial abundance and community structure by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Before the extraction. one standard PLFA (C21:0 PC) was added to soil to test the influence of charcoal on PLFAs recovery. The content of uncharred SOC and pH explained a main part of the variance of soil CO2 emissions. which supports the view that charcoal had a limited effect on soil respiration. The recovery of C21:0 PC was increased in presence of aged charcoal. which contrasts with the decreased recovery recorded shortly after biochar application. This underlines that properties of charcoal evolve dramatically over time. and that a long-term vision is critical in the perspective of amending soils with biochar. Land-use had an overriding control on microbial community structure. surpassing the effect of a vast amount of charcoal present in the soil.

Allophanic soils high in organic matter (Troporthents. Hydrandepts) exhibit a low selectivity for K-ions. Potassium is adsorbed specifically in the halloysitic soils (Humitropepts). A positive relationship exists between the affinity for K+ and the halloysite content. This relation is most likely due to the close association of 1∶1 hydrated phyllosilicates with 2∶1 smectitic clay minerals. A lower selectivity for K was observed in the kaolinitic soil materials (Dystropepts).

Studies at the cellular level,2000,PJ Marie and D Jones and L Vico and A Zallone and Maurice Hinsenkamp and R Cancedda,67,,1,2-9,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Mechanical loading is known to be essential for the maintenance of skeletal integrity. Both microgravity and reduction of mechanical load lead to rapid bone loss resulting from uncoupling between bone resorption and formation. The huge loss of bone mass (and structural mechanical efficiency) induced by complete immobilization or weightlessness occur despite the normal. healthy condition of the endocrine systems. Although an endocrine-metabolic equilibrium is essential for normal skeletal development and structural integrity. endocrine-metabolic imbalances usually act as disturbers of the mechanostatic feedback mechanism [1]. Bone remodeling is a life-long process aiming at maintaining the skeleton at its best for what concerns mechanical properties. The mechanical quality of bone is mainly genetically determined [2]. however. it may change considerably over time as a function of the remodeling rate [3]. The amount and the distribution of mineral. as well as bone architecture. ie. the density and spatial orientation of the trabeculae. also play a very important role in bone stiffness and strength.Bone remodeling results from the coupled bone resorption/formation activity that substitutes tiny pieces of old bone on trabecular surfaces and within cortical bone [4]. Systemic hormones and local factors regulate bone remodeling. and the aim of this continuous activity is to replace old bone. often not sufficiently vascularized or not in line with new mechanical situations of the body with new mineralized matrix.

Moreover the use of controlateral limbs as a control series avoid inter-individual variations and staining artefacts.The results show that the electromagnetic signal used produces modifications in the morphology and the metabolism of the different components of the bone. The modifications observed in the stimulated limbs are: a thicker proliferative layer of chondrocytes. a better lining up of the trabecula and a better configuration of the cartilage. These modifications are probably due to a change in the components of the cartilaginous matrix.

For clinical implantation the two main options are demineralised bone matrix (DBM) and recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins (rhBMP). Many clinical studies agree on an equivalent osteoinductive effect between DBM. BMPs and autologous bone graft; however. the different origins and processing of DBM and rhBMP may introduce some fluctuations. Their respective characteristics are reviewed and possible interactions with their effectiveness are analysed. The main difference concerns the concentration of BMPs. which varies to an order of magnitude of 106 between DBM and rhBMPs. This may explain the variability in efficiency of some products and the adverse effects.

1224688,Enzymatic antinutritive defenses of the tomato plant against insects,1991,Sean S Duffey and Gary W Felton,,,,166-197,,The tomato plant. Lycopersicon esculentum. contains constitutive and inducible chemical defenses that play a significant role in protection from attack by a variety of insects and pathogens. Most studies on chemical bases of resistance of the tomato plant against insects have focused on constitutive. single-factor components which exert their effect upon the insect by directly poisoning it. We discuss an approach to resistance which relies upon the simultaneous action of multi-component constitutive and inducible defenses which indirectly retard insect growth by depriving the insect of essential nutrients. The driving force of this resistance is predominantly derived from oxidative enzymes which. upon damage to the plant. activate certain constitutive components to highly reactive alkylating agents (electrophiles). which in turn render dietary protein and other essential or limiting nutrients unutilizable.

Cuscuta pentagona seedlings exhibit directed growth toward nearby tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) and toward extracted tomato-plant volatiles presented in the absence of other cues. Impatiens (Impatiens wallerana) and wheat plants (Triticum aestivum) also elicit directed growth.

Ltd.,While extensive research has examined plant defense responses to attack by herbivores and pathogens. plant responses to parasitism by other plants are not well characterized. The expression of induced plant defenses is mediated by complex signaling networks in which the plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) play key roles. In general. JA‐mediated signaling pathways are implicated in the regulation of antiherbivore defenses. while the SA pathway is associated with defense responses against pathogens. However. there are many exceptions to this basic framework. and recent work suggests that interactions between the JA and SA pathways may play important roles in fine‐tuning defense responses.

But. almost no empirical work has explored the implications of such apparent manipulation for interactions among co-infecting pathogens. We examined single and mixed infections of two potyviruses. watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) and zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV). that frequently co-occur in cucurbitaceae populations and share the same aphid vectors. We found that ZYMV isolates replicated at similar rates in single and mixed infections. whereas WMV strains accumulated to significantly lower levels in the presence of ZYMV. Furthermore. ZYMV induced changes in leaf colour and volatile emissions that enhanced aphid (Aphis gossypii) recruitment to infected plants. By contrast.

For example. some parasitic plants grow toward volatile cues from their host plants. and other plants have been shown to exhibit enhanced defense capability after exposure to volatile emissions from herbivore-damaged neighbors.

ECM provides the bulk. shape and strength of many tissues in vivo. such as basement membrane. bone and cartilage. In vitro. most animal cells can only grow when they are attached to surfaces through ECM. ECM is also the substrate for cell migration. However. ECM provides much more than just mechanical and structural support. with implications in developmental patterning. stem cell niches and cancer. ECM imparts spatial context for signalling events by various cell surface growth factor receptors and adhesion molecules such as integrins. The external physical properties of ECM may also have a role in the signalling process. ECM molecules can be flexible and extendable. and mechanical tension can expose cryptic sites. which could further interact with growth factors or their receptors. ECM proteins and structures can determine the cell behaviour. polarity. migration. differentiation. proliferation and survival by communicating with the intracellular cytoskeleton and transmission of growth factor signals.

This difficulty results from a lack of technology for establishing structure−activity relationships. which in turn is due to the structural complexity of natural heparan sulfate (HS) and difficulties of preparing well-defined HS oligosaccharides. To address this deficiency. we developed a modular approach for the parallel combinatorial synthesis of HS oligosaccharides that utilizes a relatively small number of selectively protected disaccharide building blocks. which can easily be converted into glycosyl donors and acceptors.

Further refinements in sequence analysis are needed to corroborate the simplified model proposed in Fig. 4. It is still not clear why evolution has favoured a structural motif of widely spaced sulphated domains. Presumably. some advantages must accrue to the organism from this design. and one idea. that we have discussed previously. is that the polysaccharide functions as a"" template"" for the organisation of structural proteins in the ECM and for the binding and presentation of growth factors within the matrix polymer network. The sulphated regions are likely to display considerable conformational versatility as a result of the presence of the iduronate residues. and this property may be very important for the protein-binding properties of the polysaccharides (Casu et al.. 1988). Sulphation patterns within these regions could favour oligosaccharide conformations necessary for specific protein interactions. An important question in this context is why different cells express on their surfaces HS with subtle differences in sulphation pattern. Perhaps the polymorphic features of HS are involved in higher-order tissue-and organ-specific mechanisms controlling cellular recognition and morphogenesis.

To compare these theoretical results to experimental data. gold nanoparticles in the size range of 5 to 100 nm were synthesized and characterized with TEM and UV−vis. Excellent agreement was found between theory and experiment. It is shown that the data produced here can be used to determine both size and concentration of gold nanoparticles directly from UV−vis spectra. Equations for this purpose are derived. and the precision of various methods is discussed. The major aim of this work is to provide a simple and fast method to determine size and concentration of nanoparticles. ,True,pK_qvc0AAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,2913,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac0702084,9893252832215576219,/scholar?cites=9893252832215576219,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Nazarkovsky/post/I_got_a_peak_at_422_423_nm_in_UV_spectra_What_is_the_size_of_my_Ag_nanoparticle/attachment/59d62c97c49f478072e9e138/AS%3A273548038344705%401442230343226/download/Au+particles.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,Two samples of polymer‐coated cobalt nanoparticles were synthesized and dispersed in agarose gel and water. The relaxivities r1 and r2 of the two samples were obtained at different temperatures (25. 37 and 40°C) and magnetic field strengths (1.5 and 3 T). The average cobalt core diameters of the two samples were 3.3 and 3.9 nm (measured by transmission electron microscopy); the corresponding average total diameters (cobalt core + polymer coating) were 13 and 28 nm (measured by dynamic light scattering). The larger particles had the higher r1 relaxivity. whilst r2 was similar for the two samples. There was no significant change in r1 or r2 relaxivities with temperature but r1 at 1.5 T was approximately double the value at 3 T.

If we had the ability to control precisely the surface properties of nanoparticles. we could direct their assembly into higher order structures to provide a route to new materials and devices. as well as synthetic analogues of biological macromolecular complexes. The scope of this review is to discuss and overview the current knowledge base and approaches that are used to control the surface properties of nanoparticles and to impart recognition functions to the nanoparticles that can drive self-assembly processes. The approaches discussed focus on the self-assembly and the self-organisation of ligands. in solution …,True,3C3hLOcAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,58,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2011/jm/c1jm11945a,5162832505908826539,/scholar?cites=5162832505908826539,,,0,0,0

For cell tracking applications. the cells of interest are labeled with the contrast agent prior to injection. However. after uptake into cells by endocytosis. the confinement and high concentration in endosomes leads to plasmon band broadening and reduced absorbance. This would limit the potential of multispectral optoacoustic tomography in terms of spectral processing and. consequently. sensitivity. Here. we show that steric hindrance provided by silica coating of the nanorods leads to the preservation of their spectral properties and improved photoacoustic sensitivity.

We demonstrate how photothermal microscopy can be used to follow the cellular uptake of SPIONs by direct imaging of the iron oxide core. This offers two important advantages when compared with current strategies employed to image magnetic cores: first. it is nondestructive and is therefore suitable for studies of live cells and. second. it offers a higher sensitivity and resolution. thus allowing for the identification of low levels of SPIONs within a precise subcellular location. We have shown that this technique may be applied to the imaging of both cell monolayers and cryosections.

Inspired by structural biology. a strategy based on chemical cross‐linking is introduced to probe proximity between functional peptides embedded in a mixed self‐assembled monolayer at the surface of a nanoparticle. The physical basis of the proximity measurement is a transition from intramolecular to intermolecular cross‐linking as the functional peptides get closer. Experimental investigations of a binary peptide self‐assembled monolayer show that this transition happens at an extremely low molar ratio of the functional versus matrix peptide. Molecular dynamics simulations of the peptide self‐assembled monolayer are used to calculate the volume explored by the reactive groups.

As cell membranes are impermeable to most molecular cargos. viral peptides have been used to bolster their internalisation through endocytosis and help their release to the cytosol by bursting the endosomal vesicles. However. conflicting results have been reported on the extent of the cytosolic delivery achieved. To evaluate their potential. we used gold nanoparticles as model cargos and systematically assessed how the functionalisation of their surface by either or both of the viral peptides TAT and HA2 influenced their intracellular delivery. We evaluated the number of gold nanoparticles present in cells after internalisation using photothermal microscopy and their subcellular localisation by electron microscopy.

This stripe morphology has been proposed to strongly affect the physicochemical and biochemical properties of the particles. We critique the published evidence for striped nanoparticles in detail. with a particular focus on the interpretation of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) data (as this is the only technique which ostensibly provides direct evidence for the presence of stripes). Through a combination of an exhaustive re-analysis of the original data. in addition to new experimental measurements of a simple control sample comprising entirely unfunctionalised particles. we show that all of the STM evidence for striped nanoparticles published to date can instead be explained by a combination of well-known instrumental artefacts. or by issues with data acquisition/analysis protocols. We also critically re-examine the evidence for the presence of ligand stripes which has been claimed to have been found from transmission electron microscopy. nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. small angle neutron scattering experiments. and computer simulations.

Monocolonization with the commensal Escherichia coli NC101 promoted invasive carcinoma in azoxymethane (AOM)–treated Il10−/− mice. Deletion of the polyketide synthase (pks) genotoxic island from E. coli NC101 decreased tumor multiplicity and invasion in AOM/Il10−/− mice. without altering intestinal inflammation. Mucosa-associated pks+E. coli were found in a significantly high percentage of inflammatory bowel disease and CRC patients.

It shows here that the presence of the galactoside-binding galectin-3. whose concentration is markedly increased in the blood circulation of cancer patients. increases cancer cell homotypic aggregation under anchorage-independent conditions by interaction with the oncofetal Thomsen-Friedenreich carbohydrate (Galβ1.3GalNAcα-. TF) antigen on the cancer-associated transmembrane mucin protein MUC1. The galectin-3-MUC1 interaction induces MUC1 cell surface polarization and exposure of the cell surface adhesion molecules including E-cadherin. The enhanced cancer cell homotypic aggregation by galectin-MUC1 interaction increases the survival of the tumour cells under anchorage-independent conditions by allowing them to avoid initiation of anoikis (suspension-induced apoptosis). These results suggest that the interaction between free circulating galectin-3 and cancer-associated MUC1 promotes embolus formation and survival of disseminating tumour cells in the circulation. This provides new information into our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancer cell haematogenous dissemination and suggests that targeting the interaction of circulating galectin-3 with MUC1 in the circulation may represent an effective therapeutic approach for preventing metastasis.,True,9fke4QsAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,194,https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-4598-9-154,1168088965544719149,/scholar?cites=1168088965544719149,,https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-4598-9-154,0,0,0

1224873,Mucosal barrier. bacteria and inflammatory bowel disease: possibilities for therapy,2014,Yvette Merga and Barry J Campbell and Jonathan M Rhodes,32,,4,475-483,Karger Publishers,The mucosal barrier has three major components. the mucus layer. the epithelial glycocalyx and the surface epithelium itself. whose integrity largely depends on tight junction function. In health. there is relatively little direct interaction between the luminal microbiota and the epithelium - the continuous mucus layer in the colon keeps the surface epithelium out of contact with bacteria and the ileo-caecal valve ensures that the distal small intestine is relatively microbe free. Most interaction takes place at the Peyer's patches in the distal ileum and their smaller colonic equivalents. the lymphoid follicles. Peyer's patches are overlain by a ‘dome' epithelium. 5% of whose cells are specialised M (microfold) epithelial cells. which act as the major portal of entry for bacteria. There are no goblet cells in the dome epithelium and M cells have a very sparse glycocalyx allowing easy microbial interaction.

Although it is conventional to emphasise differences between IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer. such as a lower rate of Adenomatosis Polyposis Coli mutations and earlier p53 mutations. IBD-associated cancer has a similar dysplasia-cancer sequence to sporadic colon cancer. similar frequencies of major chromosomal abnormalities and of microsatellite instability and similar glycosylation changes.

It shows here that the presence of the galactoside-binding galectin-3. whose concentration is markedly increased in the blood circulation of cancer patients. increases cancer cell homotypic aggregation under anchorage-independent conditions by interaction with the oncofetal Thomsen-Friedenreich carbohydrate (Galβ1.3GalNAcα-. TF) antigen on the cancer-associated transmembrane mucin protein MUC1. The galectin-3-MUC1 interaction induces MUC1 cell surface polarization and exposure of the cell surface adhesion molecules including E-cadherin. The enhanced cancer cell homotypic aggregation by galectin-MUC1 interaction increases the survival of the tumour cells under anchorage-independent conditions by allowing them to avoid initiation of anoikis (suspension-induced apoptosis). These results suggest that the interaction between free circulating galectin-3 and cancer-associated MUC1 promotes embolus formation and survival of disseminating tumour cells in the circulation.

Although it is conventional to emphasise differences between IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer. such as a lower rate of Adenomatosis Polyposis Coli mutations and earlier p53 mutations. IBD-associated cancer has a similar dysplasia-cancer sequence to sporadic colon cancer. similar frequencies of major chromosomal abnormalities and of microsatellite instability and similar glycosylation changes. This suggests that IBD-associated colon cancer and sporadic colon cancer might have similar pathogenic mechanisms. Because the normal colon is arguably in a continual state of low-grade inflammation in response to its microbial flora. it is reasonable to suggest that both IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer may be the consequence of …,True,uM1ydiUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,142,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022240107040,14138495885791357403,/scholar?cites=14138495885791357403,,,0,0,0

ECM provides the bulk. shape and strength of many tissues in vivo. such as basement membrane. bone and cartilage. In vitro. most animal cells can only grow when they are attached to surfaces through ECM. ECM is also the substrate for cell migration. However. ECM provides much more than just mechanical and structural support. with implications in developmental patterning. stem cell niches and cancer. ECM imparts spatial context for signalling events by various cell surface growth factor receptors and adhesion molecules such as integrins. The external physical properties of ECM may also have a role in the signalling process. ECM molecules can be flexible and extendable. and mechanical tension can expose cryptic sites. which could further interact with growth factors or their receptors. ECM proteins and structures can determine the cell behaviour. polarity. migration. differentiation. proliferation and survival by communicating with the intracellular cytoskeleton and transmission of growth factor signals. Integrins and proteoglycans are the major ECM adhesion receptors which cooperate in signalling events. determining the signalling outcomes. and thus the cell fate.

Both Sulf1 and Sulf2 knockout mice show impairments in brain development and neurite outgrowth deficits in neurons.   Methodology and Main Findings To analyze the molecular mechanisms behind these impairments we focused on the postnatal cerebellum. whose development is mainly characterized by proliferation. migration. and neurite outgrowth processes of precursor neurons. Primary cerebellar granule cells isolated from Sulf1 or Sulf2 deficient newborns are characterized by a reduction in neurite length and cell survival. Furthermore. Sulf1 deficiency leads to a reduced migration capacity. The observed impairments in cell survival and neurite outgrowth could be correlated to Sulf-specific interference with signaling pathways. as shown for FGF2. GDNF and NGF. In contrast. signaling of Shh. which determines the laminar organization of the cerebellar cortex. was not influenced in either Sulf1 or Sulf2 knockouts. Biochemical analysis of cerebellar HS demonstrated. for the first time in vivo. Sulf-specific changes of 6-O-. 2-O- and N-sulfation in the knockouts. Changes of a particular HS epitope were found on the surface of Sulf2-deficient cerebellar neurons. This epitope showed a restricted localization to the inner half of the external granular layer of the postnatal cerebellum. where precursor cells undergo final maturation to form synaptic contacts.

Dodecyl sulfide-capped gold clusters have been prepared and subjected to ligand exchange reactions in perdeuterated benzene by addition of dodecanethiol and subsequently dodecyl disulfide. It is shown by 1H NMR spectroscopy that dodecanethiol molecules are readily taken up as ligands producing characteristic broad signals corresponding to the α-methylene and S−H protons. with chemical shifts close to those found for thiol in solution; these signals are absent in spectra of thiolate-capped clusters. Addition of excess disulfide to such clusters capped with both dialkyl sulfides and thiols leads to the appearance of sharp signals for free dialkyl sulfide and intact thiol. Amounts of thiols up to 50% of the ligand shell are. however. taken up by the clusters under rapid and irreversible loss of hydrogen. ,True,swGJv4wAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,247,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0120577,4721751757989374632,/scholar?cites=4721751757989374632,,,0,0,0

On first immersion at the open circuit potential (OCP) the samples are shown to have a “duplex” two-layer oxide film. composed of an amorphous hydroxide outer layer separated from the Ni substrate by NiO 1–2 layers thick that display a NiO(1 1 1) orientation. The NiO layer is thinner than that for the air-formed oxide implying that a proportion of the NiO is converted to Ni(OH)2 following immersion in 1 M KOH. This duplex oxide formed at the OCP is not removed at negative potentials up to onset of hydrogen evolution implying that more extensive reduction within hydrogen evolution is necessary to reduce the oxide.

A pronounced temperature dependence of the conductance. which scales logarithmically with T−1. is observed in the temperature range between 293 and 353 K. It is proposed that the origin of this dependence is the change in distribution between molecular conformers rather than changes in either the conduction mechanism or the electronic structure of the molecule.

Chemical shifts of protons linked to carbons changed by up to 1 ppm on substitution with O- and N-sulfate or acetyl groups. Differences up to 10 ppm were detected for 13C chemical shifts in substituted glucosamine. but a less clear dependence was found in iduronate. 1JCH values formed two groups. corresponding to either sulfation or non-sulfation at positions 2 and 3 of glucosamine. O-sulfation caused increases up to 6 Hz in 1JCH and N-sulfation decreases up to 4 Hz. N-acetylation gave similar 1JCH values to N-sulfation.

Eliminating averaging over the broad size and shape distributions produced by even the best of current synthesis methods. these studies hold great promise for gaining a deeper insight into many of the properties of metal nanoparticles. notably electronic and vibrational relaxation. All methods are based on detection of a scattered wave emitted either by the particle itself. or by its close environment. Direct absorption and interference techniques rely on the particle’s scattering and have similar limits in signal-to-noise ratio. The photothermal method uses a photo-induced change in the refractive index of the environment as an additional step to scatter a wave with a different wavelength.

However. it remains unknown whether receptor recycling influences AMPAR lateral diffusion and whether EZs are important for the expression of synaptic potentiation. Here. we demonstrate that the presence of both EZs and AMPAR recycling maintain a large pool of mobile AMPARs at synapses. In addition. we find that synaptic potentiation is accompanied by an accumulation and immobilization of AMPARs at synapses resulting from both their exocytosis and stabilization at the PSD.

Although each neurotransmitter receptor family has its own trafficking characteristics. two main modes of receptor delivery to the synapse have emerged: endoexocytotic cycling and surface diffusion [eg. for glutamatergic receptors. see Bredt and Nicoll (2003) and Groc and Choquet (2006)].

Neuromelanin accumulates during aging and is the catecholamine-derived pigment of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and norepinephrine neurons of the locus coeruleus. the two neuronal populations most targeted in Parkinson's disease. Many cellular redox reactions rely on iron. however an altered distribution of reactive iron is cytotoxic. In fact. increased levels of iron in the brain of Parkinson's disease patients are present. Dopamine accumulation can induce neuronal death; however. excess dopamine can be removed by converting it into a stable compound like neuromelanin. and this process rescues the cell.

We investigated the potential capacity of such complex to reduce molecular oxygen. The addition of SOD to a solution containing Cu(I)–glutathione led to a sustained decline of the basal oxygen level. Such effect was partially reverted by the addition of catalase. The complex was able to induce the reduction of cytochrome c and the oxidation of dyhydroethidium into 2-hydroxyethidium. Both effects were totally blocked by SOD. The ability of the complex to generate superoxide radicals was confirmed by EPR spin-trapping.

They can be crosslinked with one another. or they can be derivatized to produce monomers that can form linear or branched networks. Moreover. they can form inclusion complexes with polymers and different substrates. modifying their physicochemical properties. This review shows the different applications using polymers with cyclodextrins. either by forming inclusion complexes. ternary complexes. networks. or molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). On one hand. the use of cyclodextrins enhances the properties of each polymer. and on the other the use of polymers decreases the amount of cyclodextrins required in different formulations. Both cyclodextrins and polymers contribute synergistically in several applications such as pharmacological. nutritional. environmental. and other industrial fields.

The extracellular protein Reelin. expressed by Cajal-Retzius cells during cortical development. plays critical roles on cortical lamination and synaptic maturation. and its deregulation has been associated with maladaptive conditions. In the present study. we address the effect of prenatal restraint stress (PNS) upon Reelin expression and signaling in pregnant rats during the last 10 days of pregnancy. Animals from one group. including control and PNS exposed fetuses. were sacrificed and analyzed using immunohistochemical. biochemical. cell biology and molecular biology approaches. We scored changes in the expression of Reelin. its signaling pathway and in the methylation of its promoter. A second group included control and PNS exposed animals maintained until young adulthood for behavioral studies. Using the optical dissector. we show decreased numbers of Reelin-positive neurons in cortical layer I of PNS exposed animals. In addition. neurons from PNS exposed animals display decreased Reelin expression that is paralleled by changes in components of the Reelin-signaling cascade. both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore.

Different oxidative stress-related markers were determined to assess their implication in the KC pathophysiology. Total antioxidant capacity and total nitrites present in the samples were assayed. Furthermore. lipid peroxidation products and the glutathione contents were determined. together with 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) immunohistochemistry. to establish the relationship between KC and oxidative stress.Results.: The antioxidant capacity and glutathione content in KC corneas were decreased significantly when compared with healthy corneas. Moreover. the total nitrites and lipid peroxidation were significantly elevated in the corneas with KC when compared with the controls. There was a statistically significant difference in the amount of HNE-positive cells in KC corneas when compared with healthy corneas by immunohistochemistry. Post-LASIK ectatic corneas and KC corneas showed similar results.Conclusions.: The increased levels of oxidative stress markers and the decreased antioxidant capacity and antioxidant defenses in KC corneas. as well as in the post-LASIK ectatic corneas. indicate that oxidative stress might be involved in the development of this disease and may provide new insights for its prevention and treatment in the future.,True,O9yPOqIAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,126,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2186731,7341600200313166504,/scholar?cites=7341600200313166504,,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2186731,0,0,0

Apoptotic signal is driven by a family of cysteine proteases called caspases. The β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is directly and efficiently cleaved by caspases during apoptosis. resulting in elevated β-amyloid peptide formation. Cerebellar neurons from rat pups were treated with the aged Aβ25–35 at 1 and 5 μM and fluorescence assays of caspase activity performed over 4 days. We observed an increase in caspase activity after 48 h treatment in both 1 and 5 μM treated cells. then (72–96 h) caspase activity decreased to control values.

One important mediator of sensitization is bradykinin (BK). a peptide released as a consequence of tissue damage. BK enhances the membrane ionic current activated by heat in nociceptive neurons. using a pathway that involves activation of protein kinase C (PKC). We find that five PKC isoforms are present in sensory neurons but that only PKC-ε is translocated to the cell membrane by BK. The heat response is sensitized when constitutively active PKC-ε is incorporated into nociceptive neurons. Conversely. BK-induced sensitization is suppressed by a specific peptide inhibitor of PKC-ε.

In order to manipulate the IGF system in the treatment of certain disorders. we must understand the protein–protein interactions at a molecular level.

1225480,The subtle side to hypoxia inducible factor (HIFα) regulation,2003,Rebecca L Bilton and Grant W Booker,270,,5,791-798,Blackwell Science Ltd,The transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor α‐subunit (HIFα) is pivotal in the cellular response to the stress of hypoxia. Post‐translational modification of HIFα by hydroxylase enzymes has recently been identified as a key ‘oxygen sensing’ mechanism within the cell. The absence of the substrate oxygen prevents the hydroxylases from modifying HIFα during hypoxia and allows dramatic up‐regulation of both HIFα protein stability and transcriptional activation capability. In addition to this oxygen‐dependent response. increased HIFα protein levels and/or enhanced transcriptional activity during normoxic conditions can be stimulated by various receptor‐mediated factors such as growth‐factors and cytokines (insulin. insulin‐like growth factor 1 or 2. endothelial growth factor. tumour necrosis factor α. angiotensin‐2).

IGF-II binds both the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) with high affinity. Interestingly both IGF-II and the IR-A are often upregulated in cancer and IGF-II acts via both receptors to promote cancer proliferation. There is relatively little known about the mechanism of ligand induced activation of the insulin (IR) and IGF-1R. The recently solved IR structure reveals a folded over dimer with two potential ligand binding pockets arising from residues on each receptor half. Site-directed mutagenesis has mapped receptor residues important for ligand binding to two separate sites within the ligand binding pocket and we have recently shown that the IGFs have two separate binding surfaces which interact with the receptor sites 1 and 2.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we describe a series of partial IGF-1R and IR agonists generated by mutating Glu12 of IGF-II. By comparing receptor binding affinities. abilities to induce negative cooperativity and potencies in receptor activation. we provide evidence that residue Glu12 bridges the two receptor halves leading to receptor activation.

However. IGF-II can also bind with high affinity to. and effectively activate. an isoform of the insulin receptor (IR-A) that lacks a sequence at the carboxyl-terminal end of the extracellular α subunit due to the alternative splicing of exon 11. This isoform is poorly activated by IGF-I. Here. we show that IGF-II. but not IGF-I. induces potent autophosphorylation of residues Y1158.

KRAS mutations account for approximately 30% to 40% patients who are not responsive. The serine-threonine kinase BRAF is the principal effector of KRAS. We hypothesized that. in KRAS wild-type patients. BRAF mutations could have a predictive/prognostic value. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed objective tumor responses. time to progression. overall survival (OS). and the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in 113 tumors from cetuximab-or panitumumab-treated metastatic CRC patients. The effect of the BRAF V600E mutation on cetuximab or panitumumab response was also assessed using cellular models of CRC. Results: KRAS mutations were present in 30% of the patients and were associated with resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab (P=. 011).

We have determined the crystal structure of CHIP bound to an Hsp90 C-terminal decapeptide. The structure explains how CHIP associates with either chaperone type and reveals an unusual asymmetric homodimer in which the protomers adopt radically different conformations. Additionally. we identified CHIP as a functional partner of Ubc13-Uev1a in formation of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. extending CHIP's roles into ubiquitin regulation as well as targeted destruction. The structure of Ubc13-Uev1a bound to the CHIP U box domain defines the basis for selective cooperation of CHIP with specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.

By precisely specifying the nucleotide sequence. optimal codon usage for the expression host can be ensured and convenient restriction sites incorporated as required. facilitating cassette mutagenesis and subcloning. The synthesis of even a relatively small gene has generally been considered a difficult and time consuming task. best left to specialist laboratories. In this paper. a new cost and labour saving PCR technique is described which greatly simplifies the process of gene synthesis and has the potential for the synthesis of significantly larger genes than currently established techniques. Synthetic genes are conventionally assembled by concatenation of shorter oligonucleotides. Generally. both DNA strands are completely synthesized as short overlapping oligonucleotides which are phosphorylated. annealed and ligated to generate the full-length product (Edge et al.. 1981; Ferretti et al.. 1986; Bell etal.. 1988). The cost of the synthesis can be reduced by synthesizing oligonucleotides representing the partial sequence of each strand. and the gaps in the annealed product'filled in'using DNA polymerase prior to ligation (Rink et al.. 1984). In practice. both methods give a low yield of the full-length product and require amplification by cloning before any further manipulation of the synthesized gene.Recently. a PCR procedure has been described in which a 234 base oligonucleotide was chemically synthesized and primers used to amplify any full …,True,oZwWly4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,359,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chrisostomos_Prodromou/publication/21867369_Recursive_PCR_A_novel_technique_for_total_gene_synthesis/links/0fcfd50eac94ebfe4f000000/Recursive-PCR-A-novel-technique-for-total-gene-synthesis.pdf,15206444644699409589,/scholar?cites=15206444644699409589,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chrisostomos_Prodromou/publication/21867369_Recursive_PCR_A_novel_technique_for_total_gene_synthesis/links/0fcfd50eac94ebfe4f000000/Recursive-PCR-A-novel-technique-for-total-gene-synthesis.pdf,0,0,0

Repair of uracil-DNA is achieved in a base-excision pathway initiated by a uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) enzyme of which four families have so far been identified. Family-1 enzymes are active against uracil in ssDNA and dsDNA. and recognise uracil explicitly in an extrahelical conformation via a combination of protein and bound-water interactions. Extrahelical recognition requires an efficient process of substrate location by ‘base-sampling’ probably by hopping or gliding along the DNA.

Ltd,Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone essential for the activation and assembly of many key eukaryotic signalling and regulatory proteins. Hsp90 is assisted and regulated by co‐chaperones that participate in an ordered series of dynamic multiprotein complexes. linked to Hsp90s conformationally coupled ATPase cycle. The co‐chaperones Aha1 and Hch1 bind to Hsp90 and stimulate its ATPase activity. Biochemical analysis shows that this activity is dependent on the N‐terminal domain of Aha1. which interacts with the central segment of Hsp90. The structural basis for this interaction is revealed by the crystal structure of the N‐terminal domain (1–153) of Aha1 (equivalent to the whole of Hch1) in complex with the middle segment of Hsp90 (273–530).

Rac. and Rho in MDCK cells.,1995,Anne J Ridley and Paolo M Comoglio and Alan Hall,15,Molecular and cellular biology,2,1110-1122,American Society for Microbiology Journals,Scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) stimulates the motility of epithelial cells. initially inducing centrifugal spreading of cell colonies followed by disruption of cell-cell junctions and subsequent cell scattering. These responses are accompanied by changes in the actin cytoskeleton. including increased membrane ruffling and lamellipodium extension. disappearance of peripheral actin bundles at the edges of colonies. and an overall decrease in stress fibers. The roles of the small GTP-binding proteins Ras. Rac. and Rho in regulating responses to SF/HGF were investigated by microinjection.

Recently. hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). a potent growth factor for hepatocytes involved in liver regeneration. has been proposed as a ligand. In this paper. the physiological role of the human Met/HGF receptor is investigated by studying its specific distribution in normal and neoplastic tissues. Northern blot analysis has shown that the MET gene is selectively expressed in several epithelial tissues. High levels of MET mRNA have been found in liver. gastrointestinal tract. thyroid and kidney. Western blot analysis has shown that the levels of the Met protein generally correspond to those of the mRNA. However. in the thyroid. where there is a high level of MET mRNA. the protein was barely detectable. suggesting translational or post-translational regulation. The protein was also detected in the brain. Normal or increased levels of MET mRNA and Met protein were consistently found in fresh samples of carcinomas as well as in epithelial tumor cell lines. In thyroid carcinomas of a specific histiotype the amount of Met protein. almost undetectable in the normal counterpart. was found to be increased more than 100-fold. The tissue distribution of the Met/HGF receptor indicates that this molecule is involved in growth control of epithelial cells other than hepatocytes and suggests that its increased expression may confer a growth advantage to neoplastic cells.,True,x6cT9mEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,605,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1719465,3640400602408775641,/scholar?cites=3640400602408775641,,,0,0,0

We demonstrate here that Met selectively associates with α6β4. In carcinoma cells expressing Met alone. HGF does not exert significant biological effects. Ectopic expression of α6β4 restores HGF-regulated processes. Following Met activation. α6β4 is tyrosine phosphorylated and combines with Shc and PI3K. generating an additional signaling platform that potentiates HGF-triggered activation of Ras- and PI3K-dependent pathways. In the presence of an α6β4 mutant defective for Shc recruitment. Met cannot sustain HGF-mediated responses. Surprisingly. a truncated β4 unable to bind laminins retains the activity of wild-type α6β4.

Data collected from digestion of 10-. 2-. 1-. and 0.2-μg portions of a protein standard mixture indicated that an organic−aqueous solvent system containing 80% acetonitrile consistently provided the most complete digestion. producing more peptide identifications than the other solvent systems tested. For example. a 1-h digestion in 80% acetonitrile yielded over 52% more peptides than the overnight digestion of 1 μg …,True,w__JyvMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,208,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac051348l,12474445870396664605,/scholar?cites=12474445870396664605,,https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/Paper_2006_Strader_Digestion.pdf,0,0,0
1225649,Proteome research: mass spectrometry,2000,Peter James,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Recent advances in large scale DNA sequencing technology have made it possible to sequence the entire genome of an organism. Attention is now turning to the analysis of the product of the genome. the proteome. which is the set of proteins being expressed by a cell. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for the rapid large-scale identification of these proteomes and their modifications.

1225650,Similarity among tandem mass spectra from proteomic experiments: detection. significance. and utility,2003,David L Tabb and Michael J MacCoss and Christine C Wu and Scott D Anderson and John R Yates,75,Analytical chemistry,10,2470-2477,American Chemical Society,Liquid chromatography paired with tandem mass spectrometry is a standard technique for identifying peptides from complex protein mixtures. Most fragment ion spectra acquired by this technique are unique. but some are repeated. Similarities among the spectra from 1D and 2D liquid chromatography experiments were calculated by the dot product algorithm. Similar spectra were grouped. and the degree of duplication was calculated for each sample. In 1D liquid chromatography data from 1D gel bands. 18% of the fragment ion spectra were duplicates. A six-cycle 2D liquid chromatographic separation of more than 200 proteins produced 28% duplicate spectra. A rat hippocampal homogenate analyzed by a 12-cycle 2D liquid chromatographic separation contained 25% duplicate spectra. Removal of these duplicate spectra. however. resulted in fewer peptides being successfully identified by SEQUEST.

However. recent studies revealed that in the in vitro context of isolated brush borders. myosin-1a (myo1a) powers the sliding of microvillar membrane along core actin bundles. This activity also leads to the shedding of small vesicles from microvillar tips. suggesting that microvilli may function as vesicle-generating organelles in vivo. In this study. we present data in support of this hypothesis. showing that enterocyte microvilli release unilamellar vesicles into the intestinal lumen; these vesicles retain the right side out orientation of microvillar membrane. contain catalytically active brush border enzymes. and are specifically enriched in intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Moreover. myo1a knockout mice demonstrate striking perturbations in vesicle production. clearly …,True,w__JyvMAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,185,https://rupress.org/jcb/article/185/7/1285/35451,3162868930016064550,/scholar?cites=3162868930016064550,,https://rupress.org/jcb/article/185/7/1285/35451,0,0,0
1225652,Influence of basic residue content on fragment ion peak intensities in low-energy collision-induced dissociation spectra of peptides,2004,David L Tabb and Yingying Huang and Vicki H Wysocki and John R Yates,76,Analytical chemistry,5,1243-1248,American Chemical Society,The primary utility of trypsin digestion in proteomics is that it cleaves proteins at predictable locations. but it is also notable for yielding peptides that terminate in basic arginine and lysine residues. Tryptic peptides fragment in ion trap tandem mass spectrometry to produce prominent C-terminal y series ions. Alternative proteolytic digests may produce peptides that do not follow these rules. In this study. we examine 2568 peptides generated through proteinase K digestion. a technique that produces a greater diversity of basic residue content in peptides. We show that the position of basic residues within peptides influences the peak intensities of b and y series ions; a basic residue near the N-terminus of a peptide can lead to prominent b series peaks rather than the intense y series peaks associated with tryptic peptides. The effects of presence and position for arginine. lysine. and histidine are explored separately and …,True,w__JyvMAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,179,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac0351163,12017455045277292622,/scholar?cites=12017455045277292622,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2813199/,0,0,0

Tabb and John R Yates,16,Current protocols in bioinformatics,1,13.4. 1-13.4. 14,,DTASelect provides a means by which complex SEQUEST results can be filtered. organized. and viewed. A single sample may produce tens of thousands of tandem mass spectra. Manually perusing and selecting SEQUEST matches among such a mass of data carries a risk of inconsistency. DTASelect allows the user to set complex criteria for acceptance or rejection of individual spectrum results. It also features rules for dealing with multiple. identical peptide matches and for removing proteins that are insufficiently evidenced. It provides its sorted and filtered summary as HTML and text documents for easy review and also offers several auxiliary reports.

Applied to data sets from replicate LC-MS/MS analyses. these metrics displayed consistent. reasonable responses to controlled perturbations. The metrics typically displayed variations less than 10% and thus can reveal even subtle differences in performance of system components.
