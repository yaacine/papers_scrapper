1098381,New natures: joining environmental history with science and technology studies,2013,Dolly Jørgensen and Finn Arne Jørgensen and Sara B Pritchard,,,,,University of Pittsburgh Pre,New Natures broadens the dialogue between the disciplines of science and technology studies (STS) and environmental history in hopes of deepening and even transforming understandings of human-nature interactions. The volume presents richly developed historical studies that explicitly engage with key STS theories. offering models for how these theories can help crystallize central lessons from empirical histories. facilitate comparative analysis. and provide a language for complicated historical phenomena. Overall. the collection exemplifies the fruitfulness of cross-disciplinary thinking. The chapters follow three central themes: ways of knowing. or how knowledge is produced and how this mediates our understanding of the environment; constructions of environmental expertise. showing how expertise is evaluated according to categories. categorization. hierarchies. and the power afforded to expertise; and lastly. an analysis of networks. mobilities. and boundaries. demonstrating how knowledge is both diffused and constrained and what this means for humans and the environment. Contributors explore these themes by discussing a wide array of topics. including farming. forestry. indigenous land management. ecological science. pollution. trade. energy. and outer space. among others. The epilogue. by the eminent environmental historian Sverker Sörlin. views the deep entanglements of humans and nature in contemporary urbanity and argues we should preserve this relationship in the future.

1098382,Drought and declining reservoirs: Comparing media discourse in Arizona and New Mexico. 2002–2004,2006,John Sonnett and Barbara J Morehouse and Thomas D Finger and Gregg Garfin and Nicholas Rattray,16,Global Environmental Change,1,95-113,Pergamon,Media discourses about drought impacts on lakes and reservoirs in Arizona and New Mexico between 2002 and 2004 are compared to show how discursive contexts shape the framing of drought in temporal and spatial scales. Discursive contexts in the two states are shaped by their cultural and political histories and the differential development of water delivery infrastructures. Quantitative mapping of keywords in the states’ main newspapers shows how New Mexico experienced more conflict and Arizona more surprise about the drought. Qualitative case studies link these patterns to variation in framing between the states. In particular. the shorter temporal scale in New Mexico is linked to a greater sense of emergency. while the longer temporal scale in Arizona reflects the buffering of urban populations from drought through water delivery infrastructure. The finer spatial scale in Arizona. focusing on urban concerns …,True,7fQCKjcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,66,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378005000750,11699508904327063383,/scholar?cites=11699508904327063383,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43872858/2006.sonnett.gec.pdf,0,0,0

Study 1 suggested that negative mood increased the preference for consonant over dissonant information after decisions. whereas positive mood led to a more balanced information search. In Study 2. participants in negative mood rated consonant information as more pleasant and dissonant information as more annoying than participants in positive mood. In addition. the results suggested that mood regulation processes took place.

Ltd,We investigated the assumption that independent versus interdependent self‐construals yield different manifestations of psychological reactance in different group contexts. We expected collectivists (interdependent) to value the collective freedom of an ingroup more in face of an outgroup threat than individualists (independent) who should be protective of their individual freedom especially within an ingroup. In Study 1. we showed that collectivists (Taiwanese students) did not show reactance when a threat to their freedom of choice originated in the ingroup. but they did show reactance when it originated in an outgroup.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging. we investigated the processing of surrealistic and naturalistic images in visual artworks. Looking at naturalistic paintings leads to a significantly higher activation in the visual cortex and in the precuneus. Humans apparently own a sensitive mechanism even for artistic representations of the visual world to separate the impossible from what potentially matches physical reality.

In two studies. it was found that in comparison to a social inclusion manipulation. a social exclusion manipulation caused women to report significantly more positive inclinations towards traditional. gendered work allocations (Studies 1 and 2). Moreover. seeking meaning in life mediated the relationship between social exclusion and the perceived attractiveness of the roles of mother and housewife (Study 2). In a third study. adherence to family-related concepts was examined in both socially excluded and included men. but no difference was found between the two groups. It thus appears that social exclusion does not enhance the attractiveness of familial relationships for men.

In Study 1. working on a problem-solving task. participants were initially free to choose their strategy. but for a second task were told to change their strategy. The message to change was embedded in either an approach or avoidance frame. When confronted with an avoidance compared to an approach frame. the participants’ reactance toward the request was greater and. in turn. led to impaired performance. The role of reactance as a response to threat to freedom was explicitly examined in Study 2. in which participants evaluated a potential change in policy affecting their program of study herein explicitly varying whether a restriction was present or absent and whether the message was embedded in an approach versus avoidance frame. When communicated with an avoidance frame and as a restriction. participants showed the highest resistance in terms of reactance. message agreement and evaluation of the communicator. The difference in agreement with the change was mediated by reactance only when a restriction was present. Overall. avoidance goal frames were associated with more resistance to change on different levels of experience (reactance. performance. person perception). Reactance mediated the effect of goal frame on other outcomes only when a restriction was present.,True,vIKfCMgAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,10,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00632/full,13239396510512524989,/scholar?cites=13239396510512524989,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00632/full,0,0,0

Despite the controversy regarding drought changes in the last decades [1–3]. increases in drought intensity are clearly identified in some areas [4] and it is believed that although increased heating from global warming may not directly cause droughts. it is expected that when droughts occur. they are likely to set in quicker and be more intense [5].Throughout its history. China has frequently suffered from drought disasters due to its monsoon climate and was regularly hit hard by droughts over the last decades. Although little evidence of an expansion of the area affected by droughts was found in China over the last 50 years [6]. severe droughts in southwestern China in 2010 and the middle/lower Yangtze Basin and Huaihe River Basin in 2011 have drawn more attention from the research community as well as from the public and governments alike on the impacts and problems brought on by drought. Poor performance by China’s emergency response management during recent major drought events highlights the necessity of improving both drought preparedness and emergency response skills.

The basic principle of such dams is that water is stored sub-surface instead of at the surface. Evaporation losses and contamination risks are thus greatly reduced. The sub-surface reservoirs are recharged through flash floods originating from rainfall events. A simple groundwater-flow model was developed to understand hydrological processes and flows around the dam. Two different situations in Kenya were studied with the model. The first case in Voi shows how the groundwater levels upstream of the dam and in the adjacent riverbanks are strongly influenced when the sub-surface water is used for relatively intensive irrigation. The second case in Kitui shows the relatively mild effects of household water use on groundwater levels. The model results appear to be realistic.

Generally. human decision-making is either modeled on a yearly basis or lumped together as collective social structures. Both responses are problematic. as human decision-making is more complex and organizations are the result of human agency and cannot be used as explanatory forces. A way out of the dilemma of how to include human agency is to go to the largest societal and environmental clustering possible: society itself and climate. with time steps of years or decades. In the paper. another way out is developed: to face human agency squarely. and direct the modeling approach to the agency of individuals and couple this with the lowest appropriate hydrological level and time step. This approach is supported theoretically by the work of Bruno Latour. the French sociologist and philosopher. We discuss irrigation archaeology. as it is in this discipline that the issues of scale and explanatory force are well discussed. The issue is not just what scale to use: it is what scale matters. We argue that understanding the arrangements that permitted the management of irrigation over centuries requires modeling and understanding the small-scale. day-to-day operations and personal interactions upon which they were built.

Engineering education is an important mechanism in this process of preference‐guided selection of design solutions.

In our reconstructions. institutions are approximated by the scale of ""cooperation"". be it in the form of the extent of trade. sophisticated irrigation networks. a central state or a loosely held state with a common cultural identity. We study changes in institutions brought about by changes in factors like rainfall. population density. and land-use-induced water resource availability. in a proximate manner. These factors either change naturally or are changed by humans; in either case we contend that the changes affect the stability of cooperative structures over time. We relate the quantitative dimensions of water access by ancient populations to the co-evolution of water access and the socioeconomic and sociopolitical organizations. In doing so. we do not claim that water manipulation was the single most significant factor in stimulating social development and complexity – this would be highly reductionist. Nonetheless. we provide a discussion with the aim to enhance our understanding of the complexity of coupled human–hydrological systems.

Emergence of an engineering irrigation design approach in the Netherlands East Indies and its legacy. 1830-1990,2005,Maurits Willem Ertsen,,,,,,The apparent persistency of colonial irrigation elements in Dutch irrigation practice and education is the main source of inspiration for this book; the Netherlands East Indian irrigation regime. consisting of explicit and implicit rules for irrigation design is its subject. The book explains how the Netherlands East Indian irrigation regime developed and how (dis)continuities in irrigation education and practice after Indonesian independence can be understood. The idea of persistency in engineering is not new; engineering has been analyzed as being influenced by design schools. in which certain preferences for solutions and/or methods are maintained. The question of continuity is studied applying the concept of technological regime. which is defined in chapter 1 as a set of rules that structure activities of actors (engineers) involved in development and use of a certain technology (irrigation). Five categories of rules are distinguished: (1) founding premises or guiding principles; (2) promises and expectations about a future technology; (3) design requirements. functions to be fulfilled; (4) design tools. knowledge. design heuristics. methods and approaches; and (5) artefacts and operation. results of any design activity. The second chapter discusses guiding principles and promises and expectations for some selected colonial irrigation development processes in India and Africa.

In the Río Dulce basin. the irrigation area known as the Proyecto Río Dulce (PRD. command area 350.000 hectares) is the main irrigated area. An interesting characteristic of the PRD is that the larger landowners are mainly situated in tail end areas. Despite this potentially disadvantageous position. downstream farmers do not encounter problems in terms of water availability. This should not be regarded as self-evident: the hydraulic properties of the canals induce a need for downstream farmers to take deliberate action to ensure proper water delivery to their farms.

Gezira continues to be in use up to date. Its story shows how the abstract concept'development'is shaped through the agency of humans and non-humans alike in government offices and muddy fields. Gezira provides a well-suited starting point for moving into the networks of development without any pre-suggested division in terms of levels. contexts or relations.

Generally. human decision-making is either modeled on a yearly basis or lumped together as collective social structures. Both 5 responses are problematic. as human decision making is more complex and organizations are the result of human agency and cannot be used as explanatory forces. A way out of the dilemma how to include human agency is to go to the largest societal and environmental clustering possible: society itself and climate. with time steps of years or decades. In the paper. the other way out is developed: to face human 10 agency squarely. and direct the modeling approach to the human agency of individuals and couple this with the lowest appropriate hydrological level and time step. This approach is supported theoretically by the work of Bruno Latour. the French sociologist and philosopher. We discuss irrigation archaeology. as it is in this discipline that the issues of scale and explanatory force are well discussed. The issue is not just what scale 15 to use: it is what scale matters. We argue that understanding the arrangements that permitted the management of irrigation over centuries. requires modeling and understanding the small-scale. day-to-day operations and personal interactions upon which they were built. This effort. however. must be informed by the longer-term dynamics as these provide the context within which human agency. is acted out. 20,True,tZ33GM8AAAAJ:37UQlXuwjP4C,8,https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/10/14265/2013/hessd-10-14265-2013.pdf,6670462565012315669,/scholar?cites=6670462565012315669,,https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/10/14265/2013/hessd-10-14265-2013.pdf,0,0,0

PSCs are readily isolatable through fluorescent-activated cell sorting from adipose tissue and have been previously shown to be indistinguishable from MSCs in the phenotype and differentiation potential. PSCs consist of two distinct cell populations: (1) pericytes (CD146+. CD34−. and CD45−). which surround capillaries and microvessels. and (2) adventitial cells (CD146−. CD34+. and CD45−). found within the tunica adventitia of large arteries and veins.

1098478,Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling is critical for human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic differentiation,2016,Chen-Shuang Li and Zhong Zheng and Xiao-Xia Su and Fei Wang and Michelle Ling and Min Zou and Hong Zhou,2016,BioMed research international,,,Hindawi,Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) are recognized as candidate progenitor cells for bone regeneration. However. the mechanism of hUCMSC osteogenesis remains unclear. In this study. we revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling is involved in hUCMSC osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Particularly. the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 signaling pathways maintained a consistent level in hUCMSCs through the entire 21-day osteogenic differentiation period. At the same time. the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signaling significantly increased from day 5. peaked at day 9. and declined thereafter. Moreover. gene profiling of osteogenic markers. alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity measurement. and alizarin red staining demonstrated that the application of U0126. a specific inhibitor for ERK activation. completely prohibited hUCMSC osteogenic differentiation. However. when U0126 was removed from the culture at day 9. ERK activation and osteogenic differentiation of hUCMSCs were partially recovered. Together. these findings demonstrate that the activation of ERK signaling is essential for hUCMSC osteogenic differentiation. which points out the significance of ERK signaling pathway to regulate the osteogenic differentiation of hUCMSCs as an alternative cell source for bone tissue engineering.,True,OADxk5oAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C,14,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/3764372/abs/,6971892259467120281,/scholar?cites=6971892259467120281,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/3764372/abs/,0,0,0

For instance. in recent years. the influences of different surgical techniques on orthodontic tooth movement in the ipsilateral side of surgery were intensively investigated. Here. we attempt to examine if corticotomy could also affect the rate of tooth movement in the contralateral side of the surgery by using a rodent model. Materials and Methods. 72 eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups as follows: the Control group (orthodontic treatment devices delivered only. no tooth movement). the orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) group (orthodontic treatment devices delivered and orthodontic treatment performed). and the Corticotomy + OTM group (remote corticotomy performed. orthodontic treatment devices delivered. followed by orthodontic treatment). The surgical procedure was conducted on the right side of the maxilla at the time of appliance placement and a force of 60 g was applied between the maxillary left first molar and maxillary incisors using nickel-titanium springs to stimulate OTM.

In the dermis. basal cell carcinomas can be identified by masses of autofluorescent cells with relatively large nuclei and marked peripheral palisading. In the normal dermis. SHG from dermal collagen contributes largely to the multiphoton signal. However. within the cancer stroma. SHG signals diminish and are replaced by autofluorescent signals. indicating that normal collagen structures responsible for SHG have been altered. To better delineate the cancer cells and cancer stroma from the normal dermis. a quantitative MF to SHG index is developed. We demonstrate that this index can be used to differentiate cancer cells and adjacent cancer stroma from the normal dermis.

This suggests that they may be used to heal defects of the craniofacial or appendicular skeleton. We sought to substantiate the use of undifferentiated hASCs in the regeneration of a non-healing mouse skeletal defect.  Methodology/Principal Findings Human ASCs were harvested from female lipoaspirate. Critical-sized (4 mm) calvarial defects were created in the parietal bone of adult male nude mice. Defects were either left empty. treated with an apatite coated PLGA scaffold alone. or a scaffold with human ASCs. MicroCT scans were obtained at stratified time points post-injury. Histology. in situ hybridization. and histomorphometry were performed. Near complete healing was observed among hASC engrafted calvarial defects. This was in comparison to control groups that showed little healing (*P<0.01). Human ASCs once engrafted differentiate down an osteogenic lineage. determined by qRT-PCR and histological co-expression assays using GFP labeled cells. ASCs were shown to persist within a defect site for two weeks (shown by sex chromosome analysis and quantified using Luciferase+ ASCs). Finally. rBMP-2 was observed to increase hASC osteogenesis in vitro and osseous healing in vivo.  Conclusions/Significance Human ASCs ossify critical sized mouse calvarial defects without the need for pre-differentiation. Recombinant differentiation factors such as BMP-2 may be used to supplement hASC mediated repair. Interestingly.

In the realm of therapeutic bone regeneration. the defect or injured tissues are frequently inflamed with an abnormal expression of inflammatory mediators. Growing evidence suggests that proinflammatory cytokines inhibit osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. Thus. for successful MSC-mediated repair. it is important to overcome the inflammation-mediated inhibition of tissue regeneration.

Interestingly. increased FMOD levels have been correlated with decreased transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 expression in multiple fetal and adult rodent models. Our previous studies demonstrated that FMOD-deficiency in adult animals results in delayed wound closure and increased scar size accompanied by loose package collagen fiber networks with increased fibril diameter. In addition. we found that FMOD modulates in vitro expression and activities of TGF-β ligands in an isoform-specific manner.

During the inflammatory stage. elevated inflammatory infiltration accompanied by increased type I TGF-β receptor levels in individual inflammatory cells was observed in FMOD-null wounds. This increased inflammation was correlated with accelerated epithelial migration during the proliferative stage. On the other hand. significantly more robust expression of TGF-β3 and TGF-β receptors in FMOD-null wounds during the proliferative stage was associated with delayed dermal cell migration and proliferation. which led to postponed granulation tissue formation and wound closure and increased scar size.

YY0411 is the first bispecific antibody constructed in IgG‐Decoy receptor format. It efficiently identifies and combines both HER2 and VEGF protein. YY0411 is believed to be a candidate tumor suppressor as it significantly inhibits the colony formation ability of human cancer cells (Calu‐3. MDA‐MB‐453. and NCI‐N87 cells). The phosphorylation of HER2 and VEGF downstream components are also decreased in these cells with the treatment of YY0411. Similar to other antibodies. YY0411 has the ability to promote the secretion of IFN‐γ by T lymphocytes. In addition.

The poxvirus proteins serine proteinase inhibitor 2 (SPI-2) and cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) are involved in multiple poxvirus evasion strategies. SPI-2 and CrmA target caspase-1 to prevent apoptosis and cytokine activation. Here. we identified SPI-2 and CrmA as negative regulators of virus-triggered induction of IFN-β. Ectopic expression of SPI-2 or CrmA inhibited virus-triggered induction of IFN-β and its downstream genes. Consistently. knockdown of SPI-2 by RNAi potentiated VACV-induced transcription of antiviral genes.

Ectodysplasin (EDA) is the causative gene of XLHED.The current study reported a large Chinese XLHED pedigree. The genomic DNA of adult and fetus was extracted from peripheral blood and shed chorion cell respectively. The nucleotide variation in EDA gene was screened through direct sequencing the coding sequence. The methylation state of EDA gene’s promoter was evaluated by pyrosequencing.This Chinese XLHED family had two male patients and three carriers. All of them were with a novel EDA frameshift mutation. The mutation. c.172-173insGG. which leads to an immediate premature stop codon in exon one caused severe structural changes of EDA. Prenatal diagnosis suggested that the fetus was a female carrier. The follow-up observation of this child indicated that she had mild hypodontia of deciduous teeth at age six. The methylation level of EDA gene’s promoter was not related to carriers’ phenotype changes in this family.We reported a new frameshift mutation of EDA gene in a Chinese family.

To investigate the relationship between black tooth stain and the oral microbiota. we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare the microbial composition of dental plaque and saliva among caries-free children with and without black stain. Dental plaque and saliva. as well as black stain. were sampled from 10 children with and 15 children without black stain. Data were analyzed using the pipeline tool MOTHUR. Student’s t-test was used to compare alpha diversities and the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the relative abundances of the microbial taxa. A total of 10 phyla. 19 classes. 32 orders. 61 families and 102 genera were detected in these samples. Shannon and Simpson diversity were found to be significantly lower in saliva samples of children with black stain. Microbial diversity was reduced in the black stain compared to the plaque samples. Actinomyces. Cardiobacterium. Haemophilus. Corynebacterium. Tannerella and Treponema were more abundant and Campylobacter less abundant in plaque samples of children with black stain. Principal component analysis demonstrated clustering among the dental plaque samples from the control group. while the plaque samples from the black stain group were not and appeared to cluster into two subgroups.

1098646,Review of signaling pathways governing MSC osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation,2013,Aaron W James,2013,,,,Hindawi,Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are multipotent cells. functioning as precursors to a variety of cell types including adipocytes. osteoblasts. and chondrocytes. Between osteogenic and adipogenic lineage commitment and differentiation. a theoretical inverse relationship exists. such that differentiation towards an osteoblast phenotype occurs at the expense of an adipocytic phenotype. This balance is regulated by numerous. intersecting signaling pathways that converge on the regulation of two main transcription factors: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). These two transcription factors. PPARγ and Runx2. are generally regarded as the master regulators of adipogenesis and osteogenesis. This review will summarize signaling pathways that govern MSC fate towards osteogenic or adipocytic differentiation. A number of signaling pathways follow the inverse balance between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation and are generally proosteogenic/antiadipogenic stimuli. These include β-catenin dependent Wnt signaling. Hedgehog signaling. and NELL-1 signaling. However. other signaling pathways exhibit more context-dependent effects on adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. These include bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling and insulin growth factor (IGF) signaling. which display both proosteogenic and proadipogenic effects. In summary. understanding those factors that govern osteogenic versus adipogenic MSC differentiation has significant implications in diverse areas of human health. from obesity to osteoporosis to regenerative medicine.,True,fyKa2zEAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,421,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scientifica/2013/684736/abs/,3043134478479157416,/scholar?cites=3043134478479157416,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scientifica/2013/684736/abs/,0,0,0

1098648,Human adipose derived stromal cells heal critical size mouse calvarial defects,2010,Benjamin Levi and Aaron W James and Emily R Nelson and Dean Vistnes and Benjamin Wu and Min Lee and Ankur Gupta and Michael T Longaker,5,PloS one,6,e11177,Public Library of Science,Background Human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASCs) represent a multipotent cell stromal cell type with proven capacity to differentiate along an osteogenic lineage. This suggests that they may be used to heal defects of the craniofacial or appendicular skeleton. We sought to substantiate the use of undifferentiated hASCs in the regeneration of a non-healing mouse skeletal defect.  Methodology/Principal Findings Human ASCs were harvested from female lipoaspirate. Critical-sized (4 mm) calvarial defects were created in the parietal bone of adult male nude mice. Defects were either left empty. treated with an apatite coated PLGA scaffold alone. or a scaffold with human ASCs. MicroCT scans were obtained at stratified time points post-injury. Histology. in situ hybridization. and histomorphometry were performed. Near complete healing was observed among hASC engrafted calvarial defects. This was in comparison to control groups that showed little healing (*P<0.01). Human ASCs once engrafted differentiate down an osteogenic lineage. determined by qRT-PCR and histological co-expression assays using GFP labeled cells. ASCs were shown to persist within a defect site for two weeks (shown by sex chromosome analysis and quantified using Luciferase+ ASCs). Finally. rBMP-2 was observed to increase hASC osteogenesis in vitro and osseous healing in vivo.

Here. we provide evidence that each lineage contributes a unique stem cell population to the regeneration of injured adult bones. Using Wnt1Cre::Z/EG mice we found that the neural crest-derived mandible heals with neural crest-derived skeletal stem cells. whereas the mesoderm-derived tibia heals with mesoderm-derived stem cells. We tested whether skeletal stem cells from each lineage were functionally interchangeable by grafting mesoderm-derived cells into mandibular defects. and vice versa. All of the grafting scenarios. except one. healed through the direct differentiation of skeletal stem cells into osteoblasts; when mesoderm-derived cells were transplanted into tibial defects they differentiated into osteoblasts but when transplanted into mandibular defects they differentiated into chondrocytes.

1098660,A review of hedgehog signaling in cranial bone development,2013,Angel Pan and Le Chang and Alan Nguyen and Aaron W James,4,,,61,Frontiers,During craniofacial development. the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is essential for mesodermal tissue patterning and differentiation. The Hedgehog family consists of three protein ligands: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). Indian Hedgehog (IHH). and Desert Hedgehog (DHH). of which two are expressed in the craniofacial complex (IHH and SHH). Dysregulations in HH signaling are well documented to result in a wide range of craniofacial abnormalities. including holoprosencephaly. hypotelorism. and cleft lip/palate. Furthermore. mutations in HH effectors. co-receptors. and ciliary proteins result in skeletal and craniofacial deformities. Cranial suture morphogenesis is a delicate developmental process that requires control of cell commitment. proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on both what is known and what remains unknown regarding HH signaling in cranial suture morphogenesis and intramembranous ossification. As demonstrated from murine studies. expression of both SHH and IHH is critical to the formation and fusion of the cranial sutures and calvarial ossification. SHH expression has been observed in the cranial suture mesenchyme and its precise function is not fully defined. although some postulate SHH to delay cranial suture fusion. IHH expression is mainly found on the osteogenic fronts of the calvarial bones. and functions to induce cell proliferation and differentiation. Unfortunately. neonatal lethality of deficient mice precludes a detailed examination of their postnatal calvarial phenotype.

Overexpression of NELL-1 results in craniosynostosis in humans and mice. whereas lack of Nell-1 expression is associated with skeletal undermineralization. Here we show that Nell-1-haploinsufficient mice have normal skeletal development but undergo age-related osteoporosis. characterized by a reduction in osteoblast: osteoclast (OB: OC) ratio and increased bone fragility. Recombinant NELL-1 binds to integrin β1 and consequently induces Wnt/β-catenin signalling. associated with increased OB differentiation and inhibition of OC-directed bone resorption.

In particular. trauma and burn often lead to severe hypertrophic scarring with disfigurement and dysfunction. The persistence and accumulation of myofibroblasts after reepithelization have been considered to play a critical role in excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and scar contraction that comprise hypertrophic scarring.

Nucleic acid-based aptamers offer many advantageous features relative to protein-based affinity reagents. including well-established chemical synthesis. thermostability. and low production cost.

However. the selection process typically used to generate aptamers (SELEX) often requires significant resources and can fail to yield aptamers with sufficient affinity and specificity. A number of seminal theoretical models and numerical simulations have been reported in the literature offering insights into experimental factors that govern the effectiveness of the selection process. Though useful. these previous models have not considered the full spectrum of experimental factors or the potential impact of tuning these parameters at each round over the course of a multi-round selection process. We have developed an improved mathematical model to address this important question. and report that both target concentration and the degree of non-specific background binding are critical determinants of SELEX efficiency. Although smaller target concentrations should theoretically offer superior selection outcome. we show that the level of background binding dramatically affect the target concentration that will yield maximum enrichment at each round of selection. Thus. our model enables experimentalists to determine appropriate target concentrations as a means for protocol optimization. Finally. we perform a comparative analysis of two different selection methods over multiple rounds of selection. and show that methods with inherently lower background binding offer dramatic advantages in selection efficiency.,True,I60C7iUAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C,56,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043940,6194520445589481180,/scholar?cites=6194520445589481180,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043940,0,0,0

Although many high‐quality aptamers have been previously reported. it is difficult to routinely generate aptamers that possess both high affinity and specificity. One of the reasons is that conventional aptamer selection can only be performed either for affinity (positive selection) or for specificity (negative selection). but not both simultaneously.

Golgi structure/function. macroautophagy and metabolism. However. how AGS3 is regulated is little known. We demonstrate here that AGS3 interacts with a ubiquitin specific protease USP9x. and this interaction is at least partially mediated through the C-terminal G protein regulatory domain of AGS3. Knockdown of USP9x causes a moderate reduction in the level of AGS3. In contrast. overexpression of either USP9x or its deubiquitinating domain UCH increases the amount of AGS3. whereas expression of the mutant UCH domain that lacks deubiquitinating activity does not have the same effect. As previously observed in AGS3 knockdown cells. the localization of several marker proteins of the late Golgi compartments is disturbed in cells depleted of USP9x. Taken together. our study suggests that USP9x can modulate the level of a subpopulation of AGS3. and this modulation plays a role in regulating the structure of the late Golgi compartments. Finally. we have found that levels of AGS3 and USP9x are co-regulated in the prefrontal cortex of rats withdrawn from repeated cocaine treatment.

Nair,21,Protein Science,10,1403-1417,the Protein Society,Quorum sensing is used by a large variety of bacteria to regulate gene expression in a cell‐density‐dependent manner. Bacteria can synchronize population behavior using small molecules called autoinducers that are produced by cognate synthases and recognized by specific receptors. Quorum sensing plays critical roles in regulating diverse cellular functions in bacteria. including bioluminescence. virulence gene expression. biofilm formation. and antibiotic resistance. The best‐studied autoinducers are acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules. which are the primary quorum sensing signals used by Gram‐negative bacteria. In this review we focus on the AHL‐dependent quorum sensing system and highlight recent progress on structural and mechanistic studies of AHL synthases and the corresponding receptors.

One such PTM is lysine succinylation. which is regulated by sirtuin 5 (SIRT5). Although numerous proteins are modified by lysine succinylation. the physiological significance of lysine succinylation and SIRT5 remains elusive. Here. by profiling acyl-CoA molecules in various mouse tissues. we have discovered that different tissues have different acyl-CoA profiles and that succinyl-CoA is the most abundant acyl-CoA molecule in the heart. This interesting observation has prompted us to examine protein lysine succinylation in different mouse tissues in the presence and absence of SIRT5. Protein lysine succinylation predominantly accumulates in the heart when Sirt5 is deleted. Using proteomic studies. we have identified many cardiac proteins regulated by SIRT5.

We show that bacterial IspGs function in solution as (AB)2 dimers and that mutations in either both A or both B domains block activity. Chimeras harboring an A-mutation in one chain and a B-mutation in the other have 50% of the activity seen in wild-type protein. because there is still one catalytically active AB domain. However. a plant IspG functions as an AA*B monomer.

In most cases. Wnt ligands promote bone growth. which has led to speculation that Wnt factors could be used to stimulate bone healing. We gained insights into the mechanism by which Wnt signaling regulates adult bone repair through the use of the mouse strain Axin2LacZ/LacZ in which the cellular response to Wnt is increased. We found that bone healing after injury is accelerated in Axin2LacZ/LacZ mice. a consequence of more robust proliferation and earlier differentiation of skeletal stem and progenitor cells. In parallel. we devised a biochemical strategy to increase the duration and strength of Wnt signaling at the sites of skeletal injury. Purified Wnt3a was packaged in liposomal vesicles and delivered to skeletal defects. where it stimulated the proliferation of skeletal progenitor cells and accelerated their differentiation into …,True,v3MhInIAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,231,https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/29/29ra30.short,10932622178877592121,/scholar?cites=10932622178877592121,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philipp_Leucht/publication/43351839_Wnt_Proteins_Promote_Bone_Regeneration/links/54a043860cf256bf8bae185d/Wnt-Proteins-Promote-Bone-Regeneration.pdf,0,0,0

We hypothesize that interaction between osteoblasts and chondrocytes is important in regenerating the osteochondral interface on tissue-engineered osteochondral grafts. We describe here a sequential co-culturing model which permits cell–cell contact and paracrine interaction between osteoblast and chondrocytes in 3-D culture. This model was used to determine the effects of co-culture on the phenotypic maintenance of osteoblasts and chondrocytes.

All cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 C. Osteoblast-Chondrocyte Co-culture Model: High density chondrocyte micromasses were formed by plating primary chondrocytes on glass slides (2x105cells/micromass). After the micromass had adhered. osteoblasts were directly added to the top of the micromass (5x105cells/micromass). Osteoblasts alone and chondrocyte-only micromasses served as controls. The samples were grown in supplemented DMEM+ 50µg/ml of ascorbic acid. Media with 3 mM ß-glycerophosphate was added to the co-culture and osteoblast controls on day 7.

A recent area of research in the treatment of osteoarthritis is the formation of osteochondral grafts [2. 3] and the design of functional interfaces facilitating bone and cartilage integration. Recreation of the osteochondral interface is believed to be critical in initial graft integration and in ensuring long term functionality. In addition to formulating in vitro co-culture models of osteoblasts and chondrocytes [4]. we are also developing implantable osteochondral grafts by co-culturing osteoblasts and chondrocytes on degradable polymer-ceramic scaffolds. The objective of this study is to examine the interaction of these two cell types on a composite scaffold of polylactide-co-glycolide and bioactive glass (PLAGA-BG). The PLAGA-BG scaffold system (Fig. 1a) is biodegradable and osteointegrative. and has been shown to support the growth and phenotypic expression of osteoblasts in vitro [5]. Since the interaction between osteoblasts and chondrocytes as well as the mechanisms of these interactions are not well understood. this study will focus on examining the viability. attachment morphology. and growth of osteoblasts and chondrocytes during coculture on the 3-D scaffold system (Figs. 1b. 1c).

However. the relationship between substance P and degenerative tendinopathy development remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of substance P in the pathogenesis of tendinopathy. Healthy and tendinopathy tendon were harvested from human and tenocytes were cultured individually. The expression levels of genes associated with tendinopathy were compared. Next. substance P was exogenously administered to the healthy tenocyte and the effect was evaluated. The results showed that tendinopathy tenocytes had higher levels of COL3A1. MMP1. COX2. SCX. ACTA2. and substance P gene expression compared to healthy tenocytes. Next. substance P treatment on the healthy tenocyte displayed similar changes to that of the tendinopathy tenocytes. These differences between the two groups were also determined by Western blot. Additionally. cells with substance P had the tendinopathy change morphologically although cellular proliferation was significantly higher compared to that of the control group. In conclusion. substance P enhanced cellular proliferation. but concomitantly increased immature collagen (type 3 collagen). Substance P plays a crucial role in tendinopathy development and could be a future therapeutic target for treatment.

One perspective proposes that trust in the context replaces trust in individual firms and their representatives. This view suggests that firm/representative trust is not always critical. especially for customers with high trust in the context. An alternative perspective is that trust in the context fosters and legitimates trust in firms and their representatives.

However. PHA still have only a very limited market. Because of the availability of large amount of shale gas. petroleum will not raise dramatically in price. this situation makes PHA less competitive compared with low cost petroleum based plastics. Therefore. two strategies have been adopted to meet this challenge: first. the development of a super PHA production strain combined with advanced fermentation processes to produce PHA at a low cost; second. the construction of functional PHA production strains with technology to control the precise structures of PHA molecules. this will allow the resulting PHA with high value added applications.

Dordrecht,Ruminant animals have two metabolic systems that differ in their nutrient requirements: microbial metabolism in the rumen and mammalian metabolism in the tissues. Maximizing or optimizing ruminant productivity involves meeting requirements in proper amounts and balance for both metabolic systems. Ruminant nutritionists formulate diets with an intention of providing the animal with optimal levels of nutrients to achieve the optimal or maximal level of performance. Ideally. most of the dietary constituents should be digested. absorbed and utilized by the tissues as completely as possible. However. in reality. feed components are digested incompletely. more so with feedstuffs fed to ruminants than to non-ruminants.

In this review we consider one of the possible alternatives: natural plant products including essential oils. saponins and related compounds. Essential oils have been used by man for many years. Their main effects in the rumen involve reduction of protein and starch degradation and an inhibition of amino acid degradation. due to selective action on certain rumen microorganisms. specifically some bacteria. One mode of action suggested for essential oils is an effect on the pattern of bacterial colonisation of. in particular starch rich. substrates as they enter the rumen. A second possible mode of action is their inhibition of “hyper ammonia producing bacteria” involved in amino acid deamination.

1098883,Natural products as manipulators of rumen fermentation,2002,R John Wallace and Neil R McEwan and Freda M McIntosh and Belete Teferedegne and C James Newbold,15,Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences,10,1458-1468,Asian-Australasian Association of Animal Production Societies,There is increasing interest in exploiting natural products as feed additives to solve problems in animal nutrition and livestock production. Essential oils and saponins are two types of plant secondary compounds that hold promise as natural feed additives for ruminants. This paper describes recent advances in research into these additives. The research has generally concentrated on protein metabolism. Dietary essential oils caused rates of NH3 production from amino acids in ruminal fluid taken from sheep and cattle receiving the oils to decrease. yet proteinase and peptidase activities were unchanged. Hyper-ammonia-producing (HAP) bacteria were the most sensitive of ruminal bacteria to essential oils in pure culture. Essential oils also slowed colonisation and digestion of some feedstuffs. Ruminobacter amylophilus may be a key organism in mediating these effects. Saponin-containing plants and their extracts appear to be useful as a means of suppressing the bacteriolytic activity of rumen ciliate protozoa and thereby enhancing total microbial protein flow from the rumen. The effects of some saponins seems to be transient. which may stem from the hydrolysis of saponins to their corresponding sapogenin aglycones. which are much less toxic to protozoa. Saponins also have selective antibacterial effects which may prove useful in. for example. controlling starch digestion.

Rumen protozoa with their striking appearance were assumed to be important for the welfare of their host. However. despite contributing up to 50% of the bio-mass in the rumen. the role of protozoa in rumen microbial ecosystem remains unclear. Phylogenetic analysis of 18S rDNA libraries generated from the rumen of cattle. sheep. and goats has revealed an unexpected diversity of ciliated protozoa although variation in gene copy number between species makes it difficult to obtain absolute quantification. Despite repeated attempts it has proven impossible to maintain rumen protozoa in axenic culture. Thus it has been difficult to establish conclusively a role of ciliate protozoa in rumen fibre degradation. The development of techniques to clone and express ciliate genes in  phage. together with bioinformatic indices to confirm the ciliate origin of the genes has allowed the isolation and characterisation of fibrolytic genes from rumen protozoa. Elimination of the ciliate protozoa increases microbial protein supply by up to 30% and reduces methane production by up to 11%. Our recent findings suggest that holotrich protozoa play a disproportionate role in supporting methanogenesis whilst the small entodiniium are responsible for much of the bacterial protein turnover. As yet no method to control protozoa in the rumen that is safe and practically applicable has been developed. however a range of plant extract capable of controlling if not completely eliminating rumen protozoa have been described.,True,MskhsQcAAAAJ:1DsIQWDZLl8C,265,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01313/full,7160088181524517637,/scholar?cites=7160088181524517637,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01313/full,0,0,0

1098899,Manipulating rumen microbiome and fermentation through interventions during early life: a review,2015,David R Yáñez-Ruiz and Leticia Abecia and Charles J Newbold,6,,,1133,Frontiers,The nutritional manipulations of the rumen microbiome to enhance productivity and health are rather limited by the resilience of the ecosystem once established in the mature rumen. Based on recent studies. it has been suggested that the microbial colonisation that occurs soon after birth opens a possibility of manipulation with potential to produce lasting effects into adult life. This paper presents the state-of-the-art in relation to early-life nutritional interventions by addressing three areas: the development of the rumen as an organ in regards to the nutrition of the new-born. the main factors that determine the microbial population that first colonizes and establishes in the rumen. and the key immunity players that contribute to shaping the commensal microbiota in the early stage of life to understand host-microbiome specificity. The development of the rumen epithelium and muscularization are differently affected by the nature of the diet and special care should be taken with regards to transition from liquid (milk) to solid feed. The rumen is quickly colonized by all type of microorganisms straight after birth and the colonization pattern may be influenced by several factors such as presence/absence of adult animals. the first solid diet provided. and the inclusion of compounds that prevent/facilitate the establishment of some microorganisms or the direct inoculation of specific strains. The results presented show how early-life events may be related to the microbial community structure and/or the rumen activity in the animals post-weaning.

More than 4000 ESTs were sequenced from representatives of the two major groups of rumen Cilates: the order Entodiniomorphida (Entodinium simplex. Entodinium caudatum. Eudiplodinium maggii. Metadinium medium. Diploplastron affine. Polyplastron multivesiculatum and Epidinium ecaudatum) and the order Vestibuliferida. previously called Holotricha (Isotricha prostoma. Isotricha intestinalis and Dasytricha ruminantium). A comparison of the sequences with the completely sequenced genomes of Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes. followed by large-scale construction and analysis of phylogenies. identified 148 ciliate genes that specifically cluster with genes from the Bacteria and Archaea. The phylogenetic clustering with bacterial genes. coupled with the absence of close relatives of these genes in the Ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. indicates that they have been acquired via Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) after the colonization of the gut by the rumen Ciliates. Among the HGT candidates. we found an over-representation (>75%) of genes involved in metabolism. specifically in the catabolism of complex carbohydrates. a rich food source in the rumen. We propose that the acquisition of these genes has greatly facilitated the Ciliates' colonization of the rumen providing evidence for the role of HGT in the adaptation to new niches.,True,MskhsQcAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C,154,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-7-22,872910375335969102,/scholar?cites=872910375335969102,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-7-22,0,0,0

Reducing excreted nitrogen (N) and degradable organic carbon (C) by diet manipulation to improve the balance of nutrient inputs with production is an effective practice to reduce CH4 and N2O emissions. Most CH4 is produced during manure storage; therefore. reducing storage time. lowering manure temperature by storing it outside during colder seasons. and capturing and combusting the CH4 produced during storage are effective practices to reduce CH4 emission. Anaerobic digestion with combustion of the gas produced is effective in reducing CH4 emission and organic C content of manure; this increases readily available C and N for microbial processes creating little CH4 and increased N2O emissions following land application.

In this review we consider one of the possible alternatives: natural plant products including essential oils. saponins and related compounds. Essential oils have been used by man for many years. Their main effects in the rumen involve reduction of protein and starch degradation and an inhibition of amino acid degradation. due to selective action on certain rumen microorganisms. specifically some bacteria. One mode of action suggested for essential oils is an effect on the pattern of bacterial colonisation of. in particular starch rich. substrates as they enter the rumen. A second possible mode of action is their inhibition of “hyper ammonia producing bacteria” involved in amino acid deamination.

1098933,Manipulating rumen microbiome and fermentation through interventions during early life: a review,2015,David R Yáñez-Ruiz and Leticia Abecia and Charles J Newbold,6,,,1133,Frontiers,The nutritional manipulations of the rumen microbiome to enhance productivity and health are rather limited by the resilience of the ecosystem once established in the mature rumen. Based on recent studies. it has been suggested that the microbial colonisation that occurs soon after birth opens a possibility of manipulation with potential to produce lasting effects into adult life. This paper presents the state-of-the-art in relation to early-life nutritional interventions by addressing three areas: the development of the rumen as an organ in regards to the nutrition of the new-born. the main factors that determine the microbial population that first colonizes and establishes in the rumen. and the key immunity players that contribute to shaping the commensal microbiota in the early stage of life to understand host-microbiome specificity. The development of the rumen epithelium and muscularization are differently affected by the nature of the diet and special care should be taken with regards to transition from liquid (milk) to solid feed. The rumen is quickly colonized by all type of microorganisms straight after birth and the colonization pattern may be influenced by several factors such as presence/absence of adult animals. the first solid diet provided. and the inclusion of compounds that prevent/facilitate the establishment of some microorganisms or the direct inoculation of specific strains. The results presented show how early-life events may be related to the microbial community structure and/or the rumen activity in the animals post-weaning.

These microbes interact closely to breakdown plant material that is inedible for humans. whilst providing metabolic energy to the host and producing methane. Consequently. ruminants produce meat and milk. which are rich in high quality protein. vitamins and minerals and therefore contribute to food security. As world population is predicted to reach approximately 9.7 billion by 2050. ruminant production has to increase to satisfy global protein demand. despite limited land availability. whilst ensuring environmental impact is minimised. These goals can be met by deepening our understanding of the rumen microbiome. Attempts to manipulate the rumen microbiome to benefit global agricultural challenges have been ongoing for decades with limited success. mostly due to the lack of a detailed understanding of this microbiome and our limited ability to culture most of these microbes outside the rumen. The potential to manipulate the rumen microbiome and meet global livestock challenges through animal breeding and introduction of dietary interventions during early life have recently emerged as promising new technologies. Our inability to phenotype ruminants in a high-throughput manner has also hampered progress. although the recent increase in ‘omic’ data may allow further development of mathematical models and rumen microbial gene biomarkers as proxies.

1098954,Board-invited review: The hepatic oxidation theory of the control of feed intake and its application to ruminants,2009,MS Allen and BJ Bradford and M Oba,87,,10,3317-3334,Oxford University Press,Feed and energy intake of ruminant animals can change dramatically in response to changes in diet composition or metabolic state. and such changes are poorly predicted by traditional models of feed intake regulation. Recent work suggests that temporal patterns of fuel absorption. mobilization. and metabolism affect feed intake in ruminants by altering meal size and frequency. Research with nonruminants suggests that meals can be terminated by signals carried from the liver to the brain via afferents in the vagus nerve and that these signals are affected by hepatic oxidation of fuels and generation of ATP. We find these results consistent with the effects of diet on feed intake of ruminants. Of fuels metabolized by the ruminant liver. propionate is likely a primary satiety signal because its flux to the liver increases greatly during meals. Propionate is utilized for gluconeogenesis or oxidized in the liver and …,True,Q8RxFXwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,493,https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-abstract/87/10/3317/4563378,10089372583122092719,/scholar?cites=10089372583122092719,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3fb4/2da012978485a7629435eb42175407e151a6.pdf,0,0,0

Although sugars ferment faster than starch or fibre in the rumen. the rates of disaccharide hydrolysis and monosaccharide fermentation vary greatly depending on the type of sugar and rumen environment. Despite rapid fermentation in the rumen and their potential to provide greater fermentable energy to enhance microbial protein production. feeding sugars in place of dietary starch sources may not decrease rumen pH or improve N utilization efficiency and milk protein production in dairy cows.

Because the endosperm of the barley kernel is surrounded by the pericarp. which is extremely resistant to microbial degradation in the rumen. dry barley grain needs to be processed to improve its utilization by beef and dairy cattle. Dry rolling is a common processing method. and increases ruminal digestibility of grain and productivity of animals. but the grain kernels often shatter during processing. producing many fine particles. which has been associated with inconsistent animal performance.

The influence of diet type (total mixed ration- vs. pasture-based diet) on concentrations of individual fatty acids was examined. Pairwise correlations for concentrations (g/kg) of individual fatty acids in milk showed that almost all of the individual de novo fatty acids were significantly correlated with each other and with the total concentration of de novo fatty acids. Concentrations of individual unsaturated preformed fatty acids were generally positively correlated with each other but were negatively correlated with concentrations of total de novo fatty acids.

1098991,Metagenomic predictions: from microbiome to complex health and environmental phenotypes in humans and cattle,2013,Elizabeth M Ross and Peter J Moate and Leah C Marett and Ben G Cocks and Ben J Hayes,8,PloS one,9,e73056,Public Library of Science,Mammals have a large cohort of endo- and ecto- symbiotic microorganisms (the microbiome) that potentially influence host phenotypes. There have been numerous exploratory studies of these symbiotic organisms in humans and other animals. often with the aim of relating the microbiome to a complex phenotype such as body mass index (BMI) or disease state. Here. we describe an efficient methodology for predicting complex traits from quantitative microbiome profiles. The method was demonstrated by predicting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) status and BMI from human microbiome data. and enteric greenhouse gas production from dairy cattle rumen microbiome profiles. The method uses unassembled massively parallel sequencing (MPS) data to form metagenomic relationship matrices (analogous to genomic relationship matrices used in genomic predictions) to predict IBD. BMI and methane production phenotypes with useful accuracies (r = 0.423. 0.422 and 0.466 respectively). Our results show that microbiome profiles derived from MPS can be used to predict complex phenotypes of the host. Although the number of biological replicates used here limits the accuracy that can be achieved. preliminary results suggest this approach may surpass current prediction accuracies that are based on the host genome. This is especially likely for traits that are largely influenced by the gut microbiota. for example digestive tract disorders or metabolic functions such as enteric methane production in cattle.,True,Sn39xGIAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC,97,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073056,13177954950624922310,/scholar?cites=13177954950624922310,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073056,0,0,0

The presence of foliar proanthocyanidin (PA. condensed tannin) in species such as Onobrychis and Lotus correlated with foams of negligible compressive strength and persistence and also with a reputation for bloat safety in the field. PA purified from forage legume leaves significantly decreased the compressive strength of protein foams produced from purified red clover leaf protein. The decrease in the compressive strength was related to the concentration of added PA in a dose-dependent manner. A ratio of PA to protein of 0.1 reduced the compressive strength by approximately half relative to the strength of the PA-free control. Purified PAS with different chemical structures had similar effects on the compressive strength of protein foams.

Calorimeter measurements of 220 cows show a linear increase in enteric methane to increasing feed intake. over a range of forage based diets. with an average enteric methane yield of 21.4 g CH4/kg DMI (n= 220. R2= 0.70). Adoption of this empirical methane yield. rather than the equation currently used in the Australian greenhouse gas inventory would reduce the methane emissions attributed to the Australian dairy industry by approximately 10%. Analysis of additional data showed that enteric methane yield declined linearly by 0.093±0.0174 CH4 (g CH4/kg DMI) per gram increase in dietary lipid concentration. In addition. enteric methane yield also decreased markedly as the proportion of wheat in the diet increased. It is estimated that in 1980. the Australian Dairy industry produced approximately 185.000 tonnes of enteric methane and enteric methane intensity was approximately 34.1 g CH4/L milk. In 2010. the estimated production of enteric methane was 182.000 tonnes. but the enteric methane intensity had declined by approximately 40% to 20.2 g CH4/L milk. This remarkable decline in enteric methane intensity was mainly achieved by increased per-cow milk …,True,jzVQUnkAAAAJ:hNSvKAmkeYkC,12,https://www.academia.edu/download/43732915/Mitigation_of_enteric_methane_emissions_20160314-13711-r8s72u.pdf,9793420110849587501,/scholar?cites=9793420110849587501,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43732915/Mitigation_of_enteric_methane_emissions_20160314-13711-r8s72u.pdf,0,0,0

The ingestion of soil (F) (93% of dietary F) at a rate of 1562 mg F day–1 by mature dairy cows over 63 days. when compared with animals on basal diet (no soil) providing 110 mg F day–1. resulted in an increase in mean serum F concentrations from 0.10 to 0.22 mg litre–1. and no detectable change in mean metacarpal F concentrations (1125 mg F kg–1 DM). while the apparent absorption of soil F was 44%. However. an intake of soil F (77% of dietary F) at 446 mg F day–1 had no detectable effect on mean serum or bone F concentrations of the dairy cows. The relationship between soil F intake (x) and serum F concentration (y) was curvilinear (y = 0.0837e0.0007x). The observed changes in serum and bone concentrations indicate that the potential risk of fluorosis occurring in grazing dairy cows is very low.,True,jzVQUnkAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,12,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00288233.2005.9513627,17004405869109753131,/scholar?cites=17004405869109753131,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00288233.2005.9513627,0,0,0

Mean CH4 yield determined via the two techniques did not differ (P= 0.265) although results from the SF6 tracer technique were generally numerically greater than those from the respiration chambers (Figure 1).Conclusions Based on the high concordance between results for individual cows when measured by the SF6 tracer and respiration techniques. we conclude that our implementation of the SF6 tracer technique can be used to accurately measure the CH4 yield (g/kg DM intake) of individual cows. While previous studies have reported similar results (eg Grainger et al. 2007). most implemented the SF6 tracer technique within respiration chambers or reported only correlations between the two techniques. The observed concordance between techniques indicates that our implementation of the SF6 technique enables accurate determination of the CH4 emissions of individual animals.

The energy released by bacteria in the process of methane formation can be used for bacterial cell formation. Methane formation acts as an electron sink into which the hydrogen from all ruminal microorganisms drains. allowing a higher yield of adenosine triphosphate. Factors such as the type of carbohydrate in the diet. level of feed intake. digesta passage rate presence of ionophores or lipids in the diet. and ambient temperature influence the emission of methane from ruminants. Methanobrevibacter spp. appear to be the major methanogens in the rumen. but it is likely that phytogenetic analyses will identify new species.

Beef is a nutrient-rich food. providing good quality protein. vitamins B-6 and B-12. niacin. iron. and zinc. However. animal fats have gained the reputation of being less healthy. The identification of the anticarcinogenic effects of beef extracts due to the presence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has heightened interest in increasing the amount of CLA deposited in beef. Beef cattle produce CLA and deposit these compounds in the meat; thus. beef consumers can receive bioformed CLA. Beef contains both of the bioactive CLA isomers. namely. cis-9. trans-11 and trans-10. cis-12. The relative content of these CLA isomers in beef depends on the feeds consumed by the animals during production.

At high feed intake levels. the proportion of energy lost as CH4 decreases as the digestibility of the diet increases. Therefore. improving forage digestibility may improve productivity as DM and energy intake are increased. A zero-grazing experiment was conducted to determine the effect of sward DM digestibility (DMD) on DMI. CH4 emissions. and indices of rumen fermentation of beef animals.

1099076,New feed additives for ruminants-A European perspective,2006,CJ Newbold and SM Duval and NR McEwan and DR Yanez-Ruiz and KJ Hart,,"Proc. Pac. NW Anim. Nutr. Conf. Vancouver, Canada",,,,The digestive anatomy and physiology of cattle and other ruminants is markedly different to that of monogastric animals such as man. The ruminant has two additional digestive organs at the anterior end of the tract. namely the rumen and omasum. which allow the host to extract and absorb energy from fibrous plant material not otherwise available to mammalian enzymes. Digestion of food in the rumen occurs by a combination of microbial fermentation and physical breakdown during regurgitation of the food by rumination. Microbial attack is carried out by a mixed population of bacteria and ciliate protozoa. together with a smaller. but possibly mechanically important. population of anaerobic fungi (Dehority. 2004). As a result of the location of the rumen. anterior to the abomasum. feedstuffs consumed by ruminants are exposed to microbial attack prior to gastric and intestinal digestion. The rumen is essentially a fermentation chamber in which microbial attack helps digest the diet. The partly fermented food and the micro-organisms then pass through the omasum. into the abomasum and then into the small intestine. Thus unlike hindgut fermenters the products of microbial fermentation. mainly volatile fatty acids (VFA) and microbial protein. are available for absorption. Indeed VFA formed in the rumen can supply the majority of the animal's energy requirement. while microbial protein leaving the rumen can account for much. if not all. of the protein entering the small intestine. In view of the importance of the rumen in the nutrition of the host. it is perhaps not surprising that a great deal of effort has been devoted to investigating methods for manipulating …,True,AEOtlGQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,10,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Newbold/publication/288258272_New_feed_additives_for_ruminants-a_European_perspective/links/56816f8d08ae1e63f1edd5d1.pdf,17495320462723948740,/scholar?cites=17495320462723948740,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Newbold/publication/288258272_New_feed_additives_for_ruminants-a_European_perspective/links/56816f8d08ae1e63f1edd5d1.pdf,0,0,0

NO3 could serve as an alternative hydrogen sink when being reduced through nitrite to ammonia. Stochiometrically each 100g of supplemented nitrate can reduce 25.8 grams of methane. The aim was to test effects of dietary LO and NO3 supplementation on methane productions and rumen fermentation in lactating dairy cows in two separate experiments different in geographical location and basal diet.

Each period lasted 28 days. Animals were housed in slatted floor pens and individually fed using Calan Broadbent feed gates. Feed was offered in 2 equal portions at 08: 00 and 16: 00h daily. Steers were fed a 50: 50 forage: concentrate diet. with barley straw as the forage source. Intakes were restricted to 95% of voluntary intake. Three concentrates were manufactured to supply fish oil at 0. 1 or 2% DMI and all diets were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous (14% CP DM). The fish oil contained 43% EPA and 19% DHA. Dry matter intake was measured daily. Forage DM. was determined daily by oven drying at 55 C for 72h and concentrate was sampled daily. bulked by treatment to provide three samples from each experimental period and stored at-20 C prior to subsequent analysis. Following a 21-day dietary adaptation period. daily CH4 emissions were measured on all steers on days 23-27 of each period using the sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer technique of Johnson et al.(1994).

The present experiment investigated the influence of roughage to concentrate proportions and the effect of concentrate types on milk fat composition. Respectively. six lactating dairy cows were fed one of three isoenergetic (5.4±0.05 MJ net energy for lactation/kg dry matter; DM) and isonitrogenous (215±3.5 g crude protein/kg DM) diets. consisting of ryegrass hay only (33 g fatty acids/kg DM; ALA-rich. no concentrate). maize (straw. whole maize pellets and gluten; 36 g fatty acids/kg DM; LA-rich; 560 g concentrate/kg DM). or barley (straw and grain plus soybean meal; 19 g fatty acids/kg DM; LA-rich; 540 g concentrate/kg DM). The fatty acid composition of feeds and resulting milk fat were determined by gas chromatography. The ALA concentration in milk fat was highest (P< 0.001) with the hay-diet. but the proportionate transfer of ALA from diet to milk was lower (P< 0.001) than with the maize-or barley-diets. The LA concentration in milk fat was highest with the maize-diet (P< 0.05. compared with hay) but relative transfer rate was lower (P= 0.01). The transfer rates of ALA and LA were reciprocal to the intake of individual fatty acids which thus contributed more to milk fat composition than did roughage to concentrate proportions.

Because their rapid accumulation results in ruminal acidosis. enhancement of the absorption of SCFA and lactate across reticuloruminal wall is instrumental in increasing energy supply and preventing ruminal acidosis in cattle. This study investigated whether the reticuloruminal absorption of SCFAs and lactate was altered by different strategies of high concentrate feeding. Eight rumen-cannulated. non-lactating Holstein cows were fed a forage-only diet (baseline) and then gradually adapted over 6 d to a 60% concentrate level. Thereafter. this concentrate-rich diet was fed for 4 wk either continuously (Con; n = 8) or interruptedly (Int; n = 8). Absorption of SCFAs and lactate was determined in vivo from the experimental buffer introduced into the washed reticulorumen. The buffer contained acetate. propionate. butyrate and lactate at a concentration of 60. 30. 10 and 5 mmol/L. respectively and Cr-EDTA as a marker for correcting ruminal water fluxes.

This study aimed to investigate shifts in the BEBM during a long-term transient SARA model consisting of two concentrate-diet-induced SARA challenges separated by a one-week challenge break. Eight cows were fed forage and varying concentrate amounts throughout the experiment. In total. 32 rumen papilla biopsies were taken for DNA isolation (4 sampling time points per cow: at the baseline before concentrate was fed. after the first SARA challenge. after the challenge break. and after the second SARA challenge). Ruminal pH was continuously monitored. The microbiome was determined using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V345 region). In total 1.215.618 sequences were obtained and clustered into 6.833 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Campylobacter and Kingella were the most abundant OTUs (16.5% and 7.1%). According to ruminal pH dynamics. the second challenge was more severe than the first challenge. Species diversity estimates and evenness increased during the challenge break compared to all other sampling time points (P<0.05). During both SARA challenges. Kingella- and Azoarcus-OTUs decreased (0.5 and 0.4 fold-change) and a dominant Ruminobacter-OTU increased during the challenge break (18.9 fold-change; P<0.05). qPCR confirmed SARA-related shifts.

The structure of the third (C-terminal) repeat obtained by NMR analysis has a conformation related to the helix-turn-helix motif. To identify the role of each repeat in the sequence recognition of DNA. we analyzed specific interactions between c-Myb and DNA by measuring binding affinities for systematic mutants of Myb-binding DNA sites and various truncated c-Myb mutants. We found that specific interactions are localized unevenly in the AACTGAC region in the consensus binding site of c-Myb: The first adenine. third cytosine. and fifth guanine are involved in very specific interactions. in which any base substitutions reduce the binding affinity by > 500-fold.

Regulatory proteins are known to recognize specific DNA sequences directly through atomic contacts (intermolecular readout) and/or indirectly through the conformational properties of the DNA (intramolecular readout). However. little is known about the respective contributions made by these so-called direct and indirect readout mechanisms. We addressed this question by making use of information extracted from a structural database containing many protein–DNA complexes. We quantified the specificity of intermolecular (direct) readout by statistical analysis of base–amino acid interactions within protein–DNA complexes.

AUG) and    the features of the 5′ Untranslated Regions    (5′ UTRs) are important for understanding translation    regulation in eukaryotic mRNAs and for accurate prediction of the    coding region in genomic and cDNA sequences. The presence of AUG    triplets in 5′ UTRs (upstream AUGs) might effect the    initiation rate and. in the context of gene prediction. could reduce    the accuracy of the identification of the authentic start. To reveal    potential connections between the presence of upstream AUGs and    other features of 5′ UTRs. such as their length and the    start codon context. we undertook a systematic analysis of the    available eukaryotic 5′ UTR sequences.Results: We show that a large fraction of 5′ UTRs in    the available cDNA sequences. 15–53% depending on the    organism. contain upstream ATGs.

The Hsp70 family of chaperones represents an example of proteins in which ATP binding and hydrolysis at the Nucleotide Binding Domain (NBD) modulate substrate recognition at the Substrate Binding Domain (SBD). Herein. a comparative analysis of an allosteric (Hsp70-DnaK) and a non-allosteric structural homolog (Hsp110-Sse1) of the Hsp70 family is carried out through molecular dynamics simulations. starting from different conformations and ligand-states. Analysis of ligand-dependent modulation of internal fluctuations and local deformation patterns highlights the structural and dynamical changes occurring at residue level upon ATP-ADP exchange. which are connected to the conformational transition between closed and open structures. By identifying the dynamically responsive protein regions and specific cross-domain hydrogen-bonding patterns that differentiate Hsp70 from Hsp110 as a function of the nucleotide. we propose a molecular mechanism for the allosteric signal propagation of the ATP-encoded conformational signal.,True,N-tQzdIAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,53,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002844,7485769934056913617,/scholar?cites=7485769934056913617,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002844,0,0,0

To analyse a mutational spectra we apply an algorithm based on the SEM subclass approach (Simulation. Expectation. Maximization). The algorithm tries to classify the mutational sites according to different mutation probabilities. and each site should belong to one class. Each class is approximated to binomial distribution and thus any real mutational spectrum is regarded as a mixture of binomial distributions. The separation process runs iteratively. Each iteration includes the simulation. maximization and estimation procedures. To evaluate the quality of the classification results. theX2test is used.

Among modern biomaterials. calcium phosphates represent the best bone substitutes. due to their chemical features emulating the mineral phase of bone tissue. Although many studies on stem cells differentiation mechanisms have been performed involving calcium-based scaffolds. results often focus on highlighting production of in vitro bone matrix markers and in vivo tissue ingrowth. while information related to the biomolecular mechanisms involved in the early cellular calcium-mediated differentiation is not well elucidated yet. Genetic programs for osteogenesis have been just partially deciphered. and the description of the different molecules and pathways operative in these differentiations is far from complete. as well as the activity of calcium in this process. The present work aims to shed light on the involvement of extracellular calcium in MSC differentiation: a better understanding of the early stage osteogenic differentiation program of MSC seeded on calcium-based biomaterials is required in order to develop optimal strategies to promote osteogenesis through the use of new generation osteoconductive scaffolds.

Although this method is simple and widely used. a major drawback of IUPAC strings is that they necessarily remove much of the information originally present in the set of sequences.

Modern simulation tools make the analysis of key components and their interactions very effective. This paper focuses on the role of small modules and feedbacks in the gene–protein network governing the G1/S transition in mammalian cells. Mutations in this network may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Bifurcation analysis helps to identify the key components of this extremely complex interaction network. Results: We identify various positive and negative feedback loops in the network controlling the G1/S transition. It is shown that the positive feedback regulation of E2F1 and a double activator–inhibitor module can lead to bistability.

Identification and comprehensive analysis of regulatory SNPs in human gene promoters will help quantify the effects of these SNPs on human health. Based on our experimental and computer-aided study of SNPs in TATA boxes and the use of literature data. we have derived an equation for TBP/TATA equilibrium binding in three successive steps: TATA-binding protein (TBP) sliding along DNA due to their nonspecific affinity for each other ↔ recognition of the TATA box ↔ stabilization of the TBP/TATA complex. Using this equation. we have analyzed TATA boxes containing SNPs associated with human diseases and made in silico predictions of changes in TBP/TATA affinity. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)-based experimental study performed under the most standardized conditions demonstrates that the experimentally measured values are highly correlated with the predicted values: the coefficient of linear correlation. r. was 0.822 at a significance level of α<10−7 for equilibrium KD values. (-ln KD). and 0.785 at a significance level of α<10−3 for changes in equilibrium KD (δ) due to SNPs in the TATA boxes (). It has been demonstrated that the SNPs associated with increased risk of human diseases such as α-. β- and δ-thalassemia. myocardial infarction and thrombophlebitis. changes in immune response. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. lung cancer and hemophilia B Leyden cause 2–4-fold changes in TBP/TATA affinity in most cases.

Genotyping of patients with subsequent searching for SNPs more frequent than in norm is the only commonly accepted method for identification of SNP markers within the framework of translational research. The bioinformatics applications aimed at millions of unannotated SNPs of the “1000 Genomes” can make this search for SNP markers more focused and less expensive. We used our Web service involving Fisher’s -score for candidate SNP markers to find a significant change in a gene’s expression. Here we analyzed the change caused by SNPs in the gene’s promoter via a change in affinity of the TATA-binding protein for this promoter.

Those motifs are commonly located by matches to IUPAC strings derived from consensus sequences. Although this method is simple and widely used. a major drawback of IUPAC strings is that they necessarily remove much of the information originally present in the set of sequences. Nucleotide distribution matrices retain most of the information and are thus better suited to evaluate new potential sites. However. sufficiently large libraries of pre-compiled matrices are a prerequisite for practical application of any matrix-based approach and are just beginning to emerge.

Alarmingly. resistance to polymyxins has been increasingly reported worldwide recently. To rescue this last-resort class of antibiotics. it is necessary to systematically understand how P. aeruginosa alters its metabolism in response to polymyxin treatment. thereby facilitating the development of effective therapies. To this end. a genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) was used to analyze bacterial metabolic changes at the systems level.A high-quality GSMM iPAO1 was constructed for P. aeruginosa PAO1 for antimicrobial pharmacological research.

In particular. the techniques allowing the reconstruction of associative networks of various biological objects and events can be useful. In this publication. the combination of different techniques to create such a network associated with an abstract cell environment is discussed in order to gain insights into the functional as well as spatial interrelationships.

Therefore. these presentations are usually accompanied by strong side-effects. such as motion sickness which is often caused by a disturbed stereoscopic vision. The reason is that the stereoscopic visualization is usually optimized for the only head-tracked person in the CAVE – the navigator – ignoring the needs of the real target group – the audience. To overcome this misconception. this work proposes an alternative to the head tracking-based stereoscopic effect optimization.

Proteins from diverse cellular compartments are often involved in similar signaling networks.

Using data from the databases STRING. ANDSystem. IntAct and UniProt. a PPI frequency matrix of intra/inter-compartmental interactions efficiencies was constructed. This matrix included 15 human-specific cellular compartments. An approach for estimating pathway efficiency using the matrix of intra/inter-compartmental PPI frequency. based on analysis of reactions efficiencies distribution was suggested. An investigation of KEGG pathway efficiencies was conducted using the developed method. The clusterization and the ranking of KEGG pathways based on their efficiency were performed. ""Amino acid metabolism"" and ""Genetic information processing"" revealed the highest efficiencies among other functional classes of KEGG pathways. ""Nervous system"" and ""Signaling molecules interaction"" contained the most inefficient pathways.

The AIS is present in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) but absent in all other taxa. including jawless vertebrates (agnathans). We argue that the AIS has been assembled from elements that have primarily evolved to serve other functions and incorporated existing molecular cascades. resulting in the appearance of new organs and new types of cells. Some molecules serving other functions have been appropriated by the AIS. whereas others have been modified to serve new functions. either after the duplication of their encoding genes or through the acquisition of an additional function without gene duplication. A few molecules may have been created de novo. The deployment and integration of the ready-made elements gives the impression of a sudden origin of the AIS.

Relative to extant elephants. the extinct woolly mammoth. Mammuthus primigenius. had a dense hair cover and extremely long hair. which likely were adaptations to its subarctic habitat. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects hair length in a diverse set of mammalian species. Mutations in FGF5 lead to recessive long hair phenotypes in mice. dogs. and cats; and the gene has been implicated in hair length variation in rabbits. Thus. FGF5 represents a leading candidate gene for the phenotypic differences in hair length notable between extant elephants and the woolly mammoth. We therefore sequenced the three exons (except for the 3' UTR) and a portion of the promoter of FGF5 from the living elephantid species (Asian. African savanna and African forest elephants) and. using protocols for ancient DNA. from a woolly mammoth. Between the extant elephants and the mammoth. two single base substitutions were observed in FGF5. neither of which alters the amino acid sequence. Modeling of the protein structure suggests that the elephantid proteins fold similarly to the human FGF5 protein. Bioinformatics analyses and DNA sequencing of another locus that has been implicated in hair cover in humans. type I hair keratin pseudogene (KRTHAP1). also yielded negative results. Interestingly.

To answer this question we used two paralogous Hsp70s from mouse and explored whether these highly similar cytosolic molecular chaperones. which apart their temporal expression have been considered functionally interchangeable. are differentiated with respect to their lipid-binding function. We demonstrate that the two proteins bind to diverse lipids with different affinities and therefore are functionally specialized. The observed lipid-binding patterns may be related with the ability of both Hsp70s to induce cell death by binding to a particular plasma-membrane lipid and the potential of only one of them to promote cell survival by binding to a specific lysosomal-membrane lipid.

Researchers and funders alike must make daily judgments on how to best spend their limited time and money–judgments that are becoming increasingly difficult as the volume of scholarly communication increases. Not only does the number of scholarly papers continue to grow. it is joined by new forms of communication from data publications to microblog posts. To deal with incoming information. scholars have always relied upon filters. At first these filters were manually compiled compendia and corpora of the literature. But by the mid-20th century. filters built on manual indexing began to break under the weight of booming postwar science production. Garfield [1] and others pioneered a solution: automated filters that leveraged scientists own impact judgments. aggregating citations as ‘‘pellets of peer recognition.’’[2]. These citation-based filters have dramatically grown in importance and have become the tenet of how research impact is measured. But. like manual indexing 60 years ago. they may today be failing to keep up with the literature’s growing volume. velocity. and diversity [3]. Citations are heavily gamed [4–6] and are painfully slow to accumulate [7]. and overlook increasingly important societal and clinical impacts [8]. Most importantly. they overlook new scholarly forms like datasets. software. and research blogs that fall outside of the scope of citable research objects.

Yet. all phylogenetic reconstructions so far have presented microbial trees rather than networks. Here. we present a first attempt to reconstruct such an evolutionary network. which we term the “net of life.” We use available tree reconstruction methods to infer vertical inheritance. and use an ancestral state inference algorithm to map HGT events on the tree. We also describe a weighting scheme used to estimate the number of genes exchanged between pairs of organisms. We demonstrate that vertical inheritance constitutes the bulk of gene transfer on the tree of life. We term the bulk of horizontal gene flow between tree nodes as “vines.” and demonstrate that multiple but mostly tiny vines interconnect the tree.

However. recent evidence points toward a selective mode of autophagy mediated by the so-called selective autophagy receptors (SARs). SARs act by recognizing and sorting diverse cargo substrates (e.g.. proteins. organelles. pathogens) to the autophagic machinery. Known SARs are characterized by a short linear sequence motif (LIR-. LRS-. or AIM-motif) responsible for the interaction between SARs and proteins of the Atg8 family. Interestingly. many LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs) are also involved in autophagosome formation and maturation and a few of them in regulating signaling pathways.

These measures are either computed in the time domain or in the spectral domain. Since the computation of time domain measures is rather cumbersome we resort to spectral domain methods. A new measure of distance is proposed and it is based on the so-called cepstral coefficients which carry information about the log spectrum of a stationary time series.

To comprehensively assess the range of possible functions of Y-Nups. we delimit their structural and functional properties by high-specificity sequence profiles and tissue-specific expression patterns. Our analysis establishes the presence of Y-Nups across eukaryotes with novel composite domain architectures. supporting new moonlighting functions in DNA repair.

GC content and gene silencing in Salmonella,2009,Nikolas Papanikolaou and Kalliopi Trachana and Theodosios Theodosiou and Vasilis J Promponas and Ioannis Iliopoulos,10,BMC genomics,1,1-10,BioMed Central,Genes of conserved order in bacterial genomes tend to evolve slower than genes whose order is not conserved. In addition. genes with a GC content lower than the GC content of the resident genome are known to be selectively silenced by the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) in Salmonella. In this study. we use a comparative genomics approach to demonstrate that in Salmonella. genes whose order is not conserved (or genes without homologs) in closely related bacteria possess a significantly lower average GC content in comparison to genes that preserve their relative position in the genome. Moreover. these genes are more frequently targeted by H-NS than genes that have conserved their genomic neighborhood. We also observed that duplicated genes that do not preserve their genomic neighborhood are. on average. under less selective pressure. We establish a strong association between gene order. GC content and gene silencing in a model bacterial species. This analysis suggests that genes that are not under strong selective pressure (evolve faster than others) in Salmonella tend to accumulate more AT-rich mutations and are eventually silenced by H-NS.

Although the idea that tissue-specific expression is indicative of gene function in mammals is widely accepted. it has not been objectively tested nor compared with the related but distinct strategy of correlating gene co-expression as a means to predict gene function. We generated microarray expression data for nearly 40.000 known and predicted mRNAs in 55 mouse tissues. using custom-built oligonucleotide arrays. We show that quantitative transcriptional co-expression is a powerful predictor of gene function. Hundreds of functional categories. as defined by Gene Ontology 'Biological Processes'. are associated with characteristic expression patterns across all tissues. including categories that bear no overt relationship to the tissue of origin. In contrast. simple tissue-specific restriction of expression is a poor predictor of which genes are in which functional categories. As an example. the highly conserved mouse gene PWP1 is widely expressed across different tissues but is co-expressed with many RNA-processing genes; we show that the uncharacterized yeast homolog of PWP1 is required for rRNA biogenesis.

We identify here the translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) as the predominant nuclear export substrate of RanBP21/exportin 5 (Exp5). This cargo–exportin interaction is rather un usual in that eEF1A binds the exportin not directly. but instead via aminoacylated tRNAs. Exp5 thus represents the second directly RNA‐binding exportin and mediates tRNA export in parallel with exportin‐t. It was suggested recently that 10–15% of the cellular translation would occur in the nucleus.

Import receptors such as importin β or transportin bind their substrates at low RanGTP levels in the cytoplasm and release them upon encountering RanGTP in the nucleus. where a high RanGTP concentration is predicted. This substrate release is. in the case of import by the importin α/β heterodimer. coupled directly to importin β release from the NPCs. If the importin β –RanGTP interaction is prevented. import intermediates arrest at the nuclear side of the NPCs [5]. [6].

We have devised a versatile. broadly applicable in vivo system for the analysis of RNA–protein interactions in yeast. TRAP (translational repression assay procedure) is based on the translational repression of a reporter mRNA encoding green fluorescent protein by an RNA-binding protein for which a cognate binding site has been introduced into the 5′ untranslated region. Because protein binding to the 5′ untranslated region can sterically inhibit ribosome association. expression of the cognate binding protein causes significant reduction in the levels of green fluorescent protein fluorescence. By using RNA–protein interactions with affinities in the micromolar to nanomolar range. we demonstrate the specificity of TRAP as well as its ability to recover …,True,z8qxix4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,54,https://www.pnas.org/content/95/3/951.short,11649397700937203148,/scholar?cites=11649397700937203148,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/95/3/951.full.pdf,0,0,0

Bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are considered to possess lung tissue repair and vascular remodeling properties.   Objectives The study aimed to assess early EPCs levels and EPCs endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in IPF. In order to examine alterations in the mobilization of EPCs from the bone marrow we measured plasma VEGF.   Main Results Twenty-three patients with IPF and fifteen healthy subjects were included. The number of early EPCs colonies was markedly reduced in IPF patients vs controls (6.00±6.49 vs 49.68±16.73. respectively. p<0.001). EPCs were further decreased in patients presenting systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP)≥35 mmHg. The number of colonies per well correlated negatively with P(A-a)O2 (r = −0.750. p<0.001). Additionally. VEGF mRNA levels were significantly increased in IPF patients. There were no differences observed in VEGF plasma levels in IPF patients when compared to controls.   Conclusions The current data suggest that inadequate levels of early EPCs may potentially contribute to suppressed repair and recovery of the damaged pulmonary endothelium and thereby may drive the sequence of events in profibrogenic direction. Increased VEGFmRNA levels in the clinical context of IPF may represent a compensatory mechanism to overcome reduced EPCs levels.,True,z8qxix4AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,52,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053658,10138191736412710261,/scholar?cites=10138191736412710261,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053658,0,0,0

The HIF target gene repertoire includes genes responsible for the regulation of metabolism. oxygen delivery and cell survival. Although the involvement of HIFs in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism and the switch to anaerobic glycolysis under hypoxia is well established. their role in the control of lipid anabolism and catabolism remains still relatively obscure. Recent evidence indicates that many aspects of lipid metabolism are modified during hypoxia or in tumor cells in a HIF-dependent manner. contributing significantly to the pathogenesis and/or progression of cancer and metabolic disorders. However. direct transcriptional regulation by HIFs has been only demonstrated in relatively few cases. leaving open the exact and isoform-specific mechanisms that underlie HIF-dependency. This review summarizes the evidence for both direct and indirect roles of HIFs in the regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism as well as the involvement of HIFs in various diseases as demonstrated by studies with transgenic animal models.

1099638,Human microRNA targets,2004,Bino John and Anton J Enright and Alexei Aravin and Thomas Tuschl and Chris Sander and Debora S Marks,2,,11,e363,Public Library of Science,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with target mRNAs at specific sites to induce cleavage of the message or inhibit translation. The specific function of most mammalian miRNAs is unknown. We have predicted target sites on the 3′ untranslated regions of human gene transcripts for all currently known 218 mammalian miRNAs to facilitate focused experiments. We report about 2.000 human genes with miRNA target sites conserved in mammals and about 250 human genes conserved as targets between mammals and fish. The prediction algorithm optimizes sequence complementarity using position-specific rules and relies on strict requirements of interspecies conservation. Experimental support for the validity of the method comes from known targets and from strong enrichment of predicted targets in mRNAs associated with the fragile X mental retardation protein in mammals. This is consistent with the hypothesis that miRNAs act as sequence-specific adaptors in the interaction of ribonuclear particles with translationally regulated messages. Overrepresented groups of targets include mRNAs coding for transcription factors. components of the miRNA machinery. and other proteins involved in translational regulation. as well as components of the ubiquitin machinery. representing novel feedback loops in gene regulation. Detailed information about target genes. target processes. and open-source software for target prediction (miRanda) is available at http://www.microrna.org.

Network connectivity was predictive of function because interactions often occurred among functionally related genes. and similar patterns of interactions tended to identify components of the same pathway. The genetic network exhibited dense local neighborhoods; therefore. the position of a gene on a partially mapped network is predictive of other genetic interactions.

Here. we provide evidence for a new paradigm for the determinants of migration destination. As adults. sea turtles show fidelity to their natal nesting areas and then at the end of the breeding season may migrate to distant foraging sites. For a major rookery in the Mediterranean. we simulated hatchling drift by releasing 288 000 numerical particles in an area close to the nesting beaches. We show that the pattern of adult dispersion from the breeding area reflects the extent of passive dispersion that would be experienced by hatchlings. Hence. the prevailing oceanography around nesting areas may be crucial to the selection of foraging sites used by adult sea turtles. This environmental forcing may allow the rapid evolution of new migration destinations if ocean currents alter with climate change.,True,H2bfcx0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,180,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsif.2010.0009,1769792169370310404,/scholar?cites=1769792169370310404,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894886/,0,0,0

The most important threat for the loggerhead nesting areas. in Zakynthos. is the uncontrolled development of tourism (Arianoutsou. 1988). On Zakynthos. all of the areas adjacent to nesting beaches are privately owned. The Greek State. in order to stem the destruction of the sea turtles’ nesting areas. has implemented restrictive legal measures since 1984. However. legislation is poorly enforced and the failure of the state to compensate the affected by restrictions landowners. has led to uncontrolled development adjacent to nesting beaches (Charalambides. 1990; Dimopoulos. 1991).

Here. we provide evidence for a new paradigm for the determinants of migration destination. As adults. sea turtles show fidelity to their natal nesting areas and then at the end of the breeding season may migrate to distant foraging sites. For a major rookery in the Mediterranean. we simulated hatchling drift by releasing 288 000 numerical particles in an area close to the nesting beaches. We show that the pattern of adult dispersion from the breeding area reflects the extent of passive dispersion that would be experienced by hatchlings. Hence. the prevailing oceanography around nesting areas may be crucial to the selection of foraging sites used by adult sea turtles.

However. the accuracy of models that just incorporate climatic information to predict future species habitat use is widely debated. Alternatively. environmental conditions may simply need to be above some minimum threshold of climatic suitability. at which point. other factors drive population size. Using the example of nesting sites of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Mediterranean (n = 105). we developed climatic niche models to examine whether a climatic suitability threshold could be identified as a climatic indicator in order for large populations of a widespread species to exist. We then assessed the climatic suitability of sites above and below this threshold in the past (∼1900) and future (∼2100).

In this paper we investigate the correlation between network metrics and accuracy of different prediction methods. We selected six time-stamped real-world social networks and ten most widely used link prediction methods. The results of the experiments show that the performance of some methods has a strong correlation with certain network metrics. We managed to distinguish “prediction friendly” networks. for which most of the prediction methods give good performance. as well as “prediction unfriendly” networks. for which most of the methods result in high prediction error. Correlation analysis between network metrics and prediction accuracy of prediction methods may form the basis of a metalearning system where based on network characteristics it will be able to recommend the right prediction method for a given network.,True,LUU0EFgAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,70,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sp/2015/172879/abs/,14730299064697037365,/scholar?cites=14730299064697037365,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sp/2015/172879/abs/,0,0,0

To elucidate the mechanism of an inflammatory reaction. we have developed a mathematical model for immune cell interactions via the specific. dose-dependent cytokine production rates of cell populations. The model describes the criteria required for normal and pathological immune system responses and suggests that alterations in the cytokine production rates can lead to various stable levels which manifest themselves in different disease phenotypes. The model predicts that pairs of interacting immune cell populations can maintain homeostatic and elevated extracellular cytokine concentration levels. enabling them to operate as an immune system switch. The concept described here is developed in the context of psoriasis. an immune-mediated disease. but it can also offer mechanistic insights into other inflammatory pathologies as it explains how interactions between immune cell populations can lead to disease phenotypes.,True,LUU0EFgAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,64,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001024,5256089642479308139,/scholar?cites=5256089642479308139,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001024,0,0,0

A large number of methods have been successfully proposed. based on various methodologies. including linear regression. support vector regression. neural network. piece-wise regression. etc. In terms of piece-wise regression. the existing methods in literature are usually restricted to problems of very small scale. due to their inherent non-linear nature. In this work. a more efficient piece-wise linear regression method is introduced based on a novel integer linear programming formulation.

Although certain clinical phenotypes. such as plaque psoriasis. are well defined. it is currently unclear whether there are molecular subtypes that might impact on prognosis or treatment outcomes. We present a pipeline for patient stratification through a comprehensive analysis of gene expression in paired lesional and non-lesional psoriatic tissue samples. compared with controls. to establish differences in RNA expression patterns across all tissue types. Ensembles of decision tree predictors were employed to cluster psoriatic samples on the basis of gene expression patterns and reveal gene expression signatures that best discriminate molecular disease subtypes. This multi-stage procedure was applied to several published psoriasis studies and a comparison of gene expression patterns across datasets was performed. Overall. classification of psoriasis gene expression patterns revealed distinct molecular sub-groups within the clinical phenotype of plaque psoriasis. Enrichment for TGFb and ErbB signaling pathways. noted in one of the two psoriasis subgroups. suggested that this group may be more amenable to therapies targeting these pathways. Our study highlights the potential biological relevance of using ensemble decision tree predictors to determine molecular disease subtypes. in what may initially appear to be a homogenous clinical group.

Tree-based regression models are popular in literature due to their flexibility to model higher order non-linearity and great interpretability.

A delay in correct diagnosis is common for these lesions. This reflects the absence of specific blood biomarkers to detect NENs. Measurement of the neuroendocrine secretory peptide Chromogranin A (CgA) is used. but is a single value. is non-specific and assay data are highly variable. To facilitate tumor detection. we developed a multi-transcript molecular signature for PCR-based blood analysis. NEN transcripts were identified by computational analysis of 3 microarray datasets: NEN tissue (n = 15). NEN peripheral blood (n = 7). and adenocarcinoma (n = 363 tumors). The candidate gene signature was examined in 130 blood samples (NENs: n = 63) and validated in two independent sets (Set 1 [n = 115. NENs: n = 72]; Set 2 [n = 120. NENs: n = 58]). Comparison with CgA (ELISA) was undertaken in 176 samples (NENs: n = 81). 51 significantly elevated transcript markers were identified. Gene-based classifiers detected NENs in independent sets with high sensitivity (85–98%). specificity (93–97%). PPV (95–96%) and NPV (87–98%). The AUC for the NEN gene-based classifiers was 0.95–0.98 compared to 0.64 for CgA (Z-statistic 6.97–11.42. p<0.0001). Overall. the gene-based classifier was significantly (χ2 = 12.3. p<0.0005) more accurate than CgA.

The two main IBD subtypes are Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). We present the to-date largest microarray gene expression study on IBD encompassing both inflamed and un-inflamed colonic tissue. A meta-analysis including all available. comparable data was used to explore important aspects of IBD inflammation. thereby validating consistent gene expression patterns.   Methods Colon pinch biopsies from IBD patients were analysed using Illumina whole genome gene expression technology. Differential expression (DE) was identified using LIMMA linear model in the R statistical computing environment. Results were enriched for gene ontology (GO) categories. Sets of genes encoding antimicrobial proteins (AMP) and proteins involved in T helper (Th) cell differentiation were used in the interpretation of the results. All available data sets were analysed using the same methods. and results were compared on a global and focused level as t-scores.   Results Gene expression in inflamed mucosa from UC and CD are remarkably similar. The meta-analysis confirmed this. The patterns of AMP and Th cell-related gene expression were also very similar. except for IL23A which was consistently higher expressed in UC than in CD. Un-inflamed tissue from patients demonstrated minimal differences from healthy controls.   Conclusions There is no difference in the Th subgroup involvement between UC and CD.

We analysed data derived from Kenya Wildlife Service records of reported incidences of injured elephants over a ten-year period (1998-2007) from all conservation areas in Kenya. A total of 397 elephants were reported with different types of injuries. Human inflicted injuries were the most prevalent (66.2%) and consisted of deep intra-dermal gashes. The most affected parts were the forelegs with 37.2% of the injury incidences. Adult males were predominantly injured with 84% prevalence. compared to 17% for females.

1099875,The influence of body mass index. age and sex on inflammatory disease risk in semi-captive Chimpanzees,2014,Vincent Obanda and George Paul Omondi and Patrick Ilukol Chiyo,9,PLoS One,8,e104602,Public Library of Science,Obesity and ageing are emerging issues in the management of captive primates. including Chimpanzees. Pan troglodytes. Studies on humans show that obesity and old age can independently increase the risk of inflammatory-associated diseases indicated by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cells and proteins in the blood of older or obese compared to levels in younger or non-obese individuals. In humans. sex can influence the outcomes of these risks. Health management of these problems in chimpanzee populations requires an understanding of similarities and differences of factors influencing inflammatory disease risks in humans and in chimpanzees. We examined the relationship between age. sex and Body Mass Index (BMI) with hematological biomarkers of inflammatory disease risk established for humans which include the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). and neutrophil. white blood cell (WBC). platelet microparticle and platelet counts. We found that higher values of NLR. neutrophil count and platelet microparticle count were associated with higher BMI values and older age indicating increased inflammation risk in these groups; a similar pattern to humans. There was a strong sex by age interaction on inflammation risk. with older males more at risk than older females. In contrast to human studies. total WBC count was not influenced by BMI. but like humans. WBC and platelet counts were lower in older individuals compared to younger individuals. Our findings are similar to those of humans and suggest that further insight on managing chimpanzees can be gained from extensive studies of ageing and obesity in humans.

On the other hand. local communities live in close proximity to elephants and hence can play a positive role in elephant conservation by informing the authorities of the presence of injured elephants.  Methodology/Principal Findings Between 2007 and 2011. 129 elephants were monitored in Masai Mara (Kenya). of which 54 had various types of active (intentionally caused) or passive (non-intentionally caused) injuries. Also studied were 75 random control samples of apparently unaffected animals. The observed active injuries were as expected biased by age. with adults suffering more harm; on the other hand. no such bias was observed in the case of passive injuries. Bias was also observed in elephant sex since more males than females were passively and actively injured. Cases of passive and active injuries in elephants were negatively related to the proximity to roads and farms; the distribution of injured elephants was not affected by the presence of either human settlements or water sources. Overall more elephants were actively injured during the dry season than the wet season as expected. Local communities play a positive role by informing KWS authorities of the presence of injured elephants and reported 43% of all cases of injured elephants.

However. it is possible that other factors such as parasitism could be acting in synergy with drought and result in mortality. During the severe drought of 2009 in the Laikipia-Samburu ecosystem in Kenya. 38 young elephants (5–8 years old) died. Necropsy of 11 fresh elephant carcasses revealed pathological lesions on the intestinal mucosa and haemorrhages which were linked to parasitism. A nematode. Grammocephalus clathratus. from the bile duct. a trematode. Protofasciola robusta. from the duodenum and a complex of unidentified nematodes from the lower gut were isolated from the elephants.

Mosquitoes are the traditional vectors for WNV; however. the virus has also been isolated from tick species in North Africa and Europe which could be a means of introduction and spread of the virus over long distances through migratory birds. Although WNV has been isolated in mosquitoes in Kenya. paucity of genetic and pathogenicity data exists. We previously reported the isolation of WNV from ticks collected from livestock and wildlife in Ijara District of Kenya. a hotspot for arbovirus activity. Here we report the full genome sequence and phylogenetic investigation of their origin and relation to strains from other regions. A total of 10.488 ticks were sampled from animal hosts. classified to species and processed in pools of up to eight ticks per pool. Virus screening was performed by cell culture. RT-PCR and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out to determine the evolutionary relationships of our isolate. Among other viruses. WNV was isolated from a pool of Rhipicephalus pulchellus sampled from cattle. sequenced and submitted to GenBank (Accession number: KC243146). Comparative analysis with 27 different strains revealed that our isolate belongs to lineage 1 and clustered relatively closely to isolates from North Africa and Europe. Russia and the United States. Overall. Bayesian analysis based on nucleotide sequences showed that lineage 1 strains including the Kenyan strain had diverged 200 years ago from lineage 2 strains of southern Africa.

In the present study we report for the first time an outbreak of traumatic cutaneous myiasis (caused by Old World screwworm. Chrysomyia bezziana and blowfly. Lucilia sp.) in free-ranging common elands (Taurotragus oryx). The infestation affected both animal sexes and different age classes. and had a negative impact on individual fitness as well as the overall health. Severely affected individuals were euthanized. while others were clinically treated. and apparently recovered. This study indicates that myiasis-causing flies still exist in Kenya and are able to cause severe outbreaks of clinical cutaneous myiasis in wild animals.

Stephanofilaria dinniki has been implicated in the past as the causal agents for such lesions.

The nature of plant-driven nutrient depletions and the mechanisms by which these might occur are relatively poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that the proliferation of the commonly introduced coconut palm. Cocos nucifera. interrupts the flow of allochthonous marine subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems via an indirect effect: impact on birds. Birds avoid nesting or roosting in C. nucifera. thus reducing the critical nutrient inputs they bring from the marine environment. These decreases in marine subsidies then lead to reductions in available soil nutrients. decreases in leaf nutrient quality. diminished leaf palatability. and reduced herbivory.

Most existing large-scale manipulations of LMH presence/absence consist of a single exclusion treatment. and few are replicated across environmental gradients. Thus. important questions remain about the functional roles of different LMH. and how these roles depend on abiotic context. In September 2008. we constructed a series of 1-ha herbivore-exclusion plots across a 20-km rainfall gradient in central Kenya. Dubbed ""UHURU"" (Ungulate Herbivory Under Rainfall Uncertainty). this experiment aims to illuminate the ecological effects of three size classes of LMH. and how rainfall regimes shape the direction and magnitude of these effects. UHURU consists of four treatments: total-exclusion (all ungulate herbivores). mesoherbivore-exclusion (LMH >120-cm tall). megaherbivore-exclusion (elephants and giraffes). and unfenced open plots. Each treatment is replicated three times at three locations (“sites”) along the rainfall gradient: low (440 mm/year). intermediate (580 mm/year). and high (640 mm/year). There was limited variation across sites in soil attributes and LMH activity levels. Understory-plant cover was greater in plots without mesoherbivores. but did not respond strongly to the exclusion of megaherbivores. or to the additional exclusion of dik-dik and warthog.

Exactly 40 years ago. scientists from 50 nations met at the First World Climate Conference (in Geneva 1979) and agreed that alarming trends for climate change made it urgently necessary to act. Since then. similar alarms have been made through the 1992 Rio Summit. the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. and the 2015 Paris Agreement. as well as scores of other global assemblies and scientists’ explicit warnings of insufficient progress (Ripple et al. 2017). Yet greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are still rapidly rising. with increasingly damaging effects on the Earth’s climate. An immense increase of scale in endeavors to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis (IPCC 2018). Most public discussions on climate change are based on global surface temperature only. an inadequate measure to capture the breadth of human activities and the real dangers stemming from a warming planet (Briggs et al. 2015). Policymakers and the public now urgently need access to a set of indicators that convey the effects of human activities on GHG emissions and the consequent impacts on climate. our environment. and society.

Taxonomic revisions within mammals are frequent and are often motivated by the discovery of new species. In fact. an analysis of patterns of discovery suggests that complete alpha-taxonomic characterization of living mammals remains a far-off goal. Examination of chronological. geographical. and taxonomic trends in new species discoveries reveals interesting trends. telling biases. and priorities for further study. An average of 223 new valid species have been described per decade since the birth of modem taxonomic nomenclature in 1758. and this rate is increasing. Over 300 new mammal species are expected to be described this decade and some estimates suggest that 7.000+ living species of mammals will eventually be recognized. An analysis of 341 recently described species indicates that the great majority of them are restricted to threatened areas of high endemism• reiterating the biotic richness of these regions. but also indicating that most new species and the regions in which they occur require urgent conservation attention.

A recent publication by Garnett and Christidis [1] expressed concerns regarding the difficulty that taxonomic changes represent for conservation efforts and proposed the establishment of a system to govern taxonomic changes. Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects. They also assert that the lack of governance of taxonomy damages conservation efforts. harms the credibility of science. and is costly to society. Despite its fairly recent release.

To estimate the phylogenetic relationships among modern horses. zebras. asses and donkeys. we generated the first data set including complete mitochondrial sequences from all seven extant lineages within the genus Equus. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic inference confirms that zebras are monophyletic within the genus. and the Plains and Grevy’s zebras form a well-supported monophyletic group. Using ancient DNA techniques. we further characterize the complete mitochondrial genomes of three extinct equid lineages (the New World stilt-legged horses. NWSLH; the subgenus Sussemionus; and the Quagga. Equus quagga quagga). Comparisons with extant taxa confirm the NWSLH as being part of the caballines. and the Quagga and Plains zebras as being conspecific. However. the evolutionary relationships among the non-caballine lineages. including the now-extinct subgenus Sussemionus. remain unresolved. most likely due to extremely rapid radiation within this group. The closest living outgroups (rhinos and tapirs) were found to be too phylogenetically distant to calibrate reliable molecular clocks.

We sampled individuals of three endemic rodent species. Hylomyscus denniae. Hybomys lunaris and Lophuromys woosnami from four localities in the Albertine Rift. We analysed mitochondrial DNA sequence variation from fragments of the cytochrome b and control region genes and found significant phylogeographic structuring for the three taxa examined. The recovered phylogenies suggest that climatic fluctuations and volcanic activity of the Virunga Volcanoes chain have caused the fragmentation of rainforest habitat during the past 2 million years.

Herein. we analyze restriction-site associated DNA-sequences (RAD-Seq) to study recent historical processes in co-distributed mouse (Hylomyscus) and shrew (Sylvisorex) species complexes. with an aim to better determine how historical paleoenvironmental processes might have contributed to the EABH’s high diversity.

Amazonia has been a particular recipient of this treatment in a number of recent studies. We suggest that this type of approach is not necessary at this scale. and we argue that the consequences could be devastating for the largest forests of the world. Among our concerns about the treatment of these forests (Amazonia. the Congo Basin and New Guinea) is that there seems to be a lack of appreciation for. or sufficient study of. important biogeographic subdivisions within these regions.

Among the 13 species recognized from continental Africa. systematic relationships remain poorly understood. Taxonomic uncertainty regarding names. suggestions of polytypic species complexes. and undescribed cryptic diversity all contribute to the current confusion. To gain insights into the systematics of this group. we inferred single locus and multi-locus phylogenies and conducted lineage delimitation analyses using seven unlinked genes for specimens from across Africa. Recent collections from Kenya allowed us to carry out population-level analyses for the diverse assemblage of East African Scotophilus. Multi-locus coalescent delimitation methods indicated strong support for three recently named lineages thought to be restricted to Kenya and Tanzania; it also uncovered two new distinctive lineages at present known only from Kenya. Subsequent taxonomic assessments that integrate these genetic data with phenotypic. distributional. and/or ecological traits are needed to establish these lineages as valid species. Nevertheless. as many as 15 Scotophilus species may occur in continental Africa. 10 of these in Kenya alone.

Nonetheless. the systematic relationships within this family are poorly known. especially among the pipistrelle-like bats of the tribes Vespertilionini and Pipistrellini. Perhaps as a result of their drab pelage and lack of obvious morphological characters. the genus and species limits of pipistrelle-like bats remain poorly resolved. particularly in Africa. where more than one-fifth of all vesper bat species occur. Further exacerbating the problem is the accelerating description of new species within these groups.

The islands subside and erode as the plate carries them to the north‐west. eventually to become coral atolls and seamounts.

K–Ar estimates of the date of an island’s formation provide a maximum age for the taxa inhabiting the island. These ages can be used to calibrate rates of molecular change under the following assumptions: (i) K–Ar dates are accurate; (ii) tree topologies show that derivation of taxa parallels the timing of island formation; (iii) populations do not colonize long after island emergence; (iv) the coalescent point for sister taxa does not greatly predate the formation of the …,True,DUywBPsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,514,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00364.x,6519755963869297290,/scholar?cites=6519755963869297290,,http://dna.ac/filogeografia/PDFs/divtime/Fleischer%26l_98_Hawaii_evol_rates.pdf,0,0,0

The dialects are partially isolated by unsuitable habitat and are unusual because they differ via lexical rather than the less extreme phonetic differences that characterize song dialects in most other species. Because males whistle just before copulating. whistles may function in mate choice. Since flight whistles are also used over long distances. we predicted and confirmed that males within the same dialect have quantitative whistle differences of potential value for individual recognition.

This report does not make recommendations on listing status. or on management. and is solely focused on identifying the best available science. and the most appropriate interpretations of that science. The focus is on new information developed since the time of listing (1990).The review process was comprehensive and critical. and involved a core panel of 8 scientific experts. plus 9 other contributing scientists. Four public meetings were held to discuss and analyze results and their interpretation. Over 1100 documents were read. critiqued. and discussed. Outside input was solicited. and external peer review was also obtained. Some new analyses were commissioned. and additional information was collected at our request. The final report represents a synthesis of all the available information. including a full discussion of points where data are conflicting. or where there is uncertainty in interpretations.

Given this attention. it is not surprising that the few bird species that exhibit little or no parental care have become especially noteworthy. In the case of the widespread and brood-parasitic Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater). much of the notoriety has been combined with loathing. because not only does the cowbird not care for its young but its breeding activities usually result in the death of some or all of the “innocent” young of its hosts. Dawson (1923. p. 77). for example. denounced the female cowbird as “destitute of all natural affection...” and as “... the unchaste mother of a race gone wrong. an enemy of bird society.

To enhance our knowledge of the viral diversity present in bats. we initially surveyed 415 sera from African and Central American bats. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing revealed the presence of a highly diverse group of bat-derived viruses related to hepaciviruses and pegiviruses within the family Flaviridae. Subsequent PCR screening of 1.258 bat specimens collected worldwide indicated the presence of these viruses also in North America and Asia. A total of 83 bat-derived viruses were identified. representing an infection rate of nearly 5%.

Although it is generally accepted that RABV evolved originally in bats and further shifted to carnivores. mechanisms of such host shifts are poorly understood. and examples are rarely present in surveillance data. Outbreaks in carnivores caused by a RABV variant. associated with big brown bats. occurred repeatedly during 2001–2009 in the Flagstaff area of Arizona. After each outbreak. extensive control campaigns were undertaken. with no reports of further rabies cases in carnivores for the next several years. However. questions remained whether all outbreaks were caused by a single introduction and further perpetuation of bat RABV in carnivore populations. or each outbreak was caused by an independent introduction of a bat virus. Another question of concern was related to adaptive changes in the RABV genome associated with host shifts. To address these questions. we sequenced and analyzed 66 complete and 20 nearly complete RABV genomes. including those from the Flagstaff area and other similar outbreaks in carnivores. caused by bat RABVs. and representatives of the major RABV lineages circulating in North America and worldwide.

In N'Djaména. the capital of Chad. rabies is endemic with an incidence of 1.71/1.000 dogs (95% C.I. 1.45–1.98). The gold standard of rabies diagnosis is the direct immunofluorescent antibody (DFA) test. requiring a fluorescent microscope. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC. Atlanta. United States of America) developed a histochemical test using low-cost light microscopy. the direct rapid immunohistochemical test (dRIT).Methodology/Principal FindingsWe evaluated the dRIT in the Chadian National Veterinary Laboratory in N'Djaména by testing 35 fresh samples parallel with both the DFA and dRIT. Additional retests (n = 68 in Chad. n = 74 at CDC) by DFA and dRIT of stored samples enhanced the power of the evaluation. All samples were from dogs. cats. and in one case from a bat. The dRIT performed very well compared to DFA. We found a 100% agreement of the dRIT and DFA in fresh samples (n = 35). Results of retesting at CDC and in Chad depended on the condition of samples. When the sample was in good condition (fresh brain tissue). we found simple Cohen's kappa coefficient related to the DFA diagnostic results in fresh tissue of 0.87 (95% C.I. 0.63–1) up to 1.

All mammals are susceptible to infection. but lyssavirus reservoirs are represented by several species of Carnivora. with viral global diversity and distribution in toto driven by a wide variety of the Chiroptera.

We focused on RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (L) and non-coding regions. because other genes of these viruses have been described previously. The L protein is organized into six conserved blocks (I–VI). previously detected in all Mononegavirales. Furthermore. lyssaviruses have two additional conserved regions. L1 and L2. located in the COOH part of the L. L1 may be responsible for methylation of viral mRNA cap structures. whereas the significance of L2 is unclear.

Of all the species. only six namely Stoechospermum marginatum. Sargassum swartzii. S. binderi. Spatoglossum asperum. Stokeyia indica (brown) and Caulerpa racemosa (green) showed significant activity. n‐Hexane‐soluble fractions of the ethanol extract of S. marginatum and S. swartzii were found to be responsible for the activity. whereas the methanol‐soluble fractions of S. asperum and S. binderi were most active. The water extract of S. indica and C. racemosa exhibited the most prominent activity (LC50 value below 70 µg/mL) when compared with the ethanol extracts and their fractions.

Vegetable crops are vulnerable to a range of pathogenic organisms that reduce yield by killing the plant or damaging the product. thus making it unmarketable. Soil-borne diseases are among the major factors contributing to low yields of organic produce. Apart from chemical pesticides there are several methods that can be used to protect crops from soil-borne pathogens. These include the introduction of biocontrol agents against soil-borne plant pathogens. plants with therapeutic effects and organic soil amendments that stimulate antagonistic activities of microorganisms to soil-borne diseases. The decomposition of organic matter in soil also results in the accumulation of specific compounds that may be antifungal or nematicidal.

J. Bot,6,3191-3198,,Chili (Capsicum annuum) is an important vegetable and spice crop worldwide produced and consumed as fresh or processed. However production is increasingly constrained by chili plant diseases. The four diseases that lead to wilting in chili are Phytophthora root rot. Verticillium wilt. Rhizoctonia root rot. and Fusarium wilt. The association of Fusarium species with Rhizoctonia solani or root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) caused huge losses. In this study. seven strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from inner roots of healthy chili plants growing under field condition. In vitro test cell free culture filtrate of some strains showed nematicidal activity against Meloidogyne javanica root knot nematode by killing the 2nd stage juveniles and by retarding the egg hatching. In dual culture plate assay. one strain of P. aeruginosa inhibited the radial growth of all the four test root rotting fungi Macrophomina phaseolina. Rhizoctonia solani. Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum by producing the zone of inhibition. While other strains caused growth inhibition of at least 2 or 3 test fungi. Some bacterial strains also caused lysis of fungal hyphae. In screen house. application of some of these bacterial strains caused significant suppressive effect on root rotting fungi and root knot nematode infecting chili roots. Some Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains also showed positive impact on plant growth by increasing the plant height and fresh shoot weight and were found to produce indole-acetic acid at varying degree.,True,--icKtsAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,33,http://www.pakbs.org/pjbot/PDFs/41(6)/PJB41(6)3191.pdf,8501400350253514583,/scholar?cites=8501400350253514583,,http://www.pakbs.org/pjbot/PDFs/41(6)/PJB41(6)3191.pdf,0,0,0

Castor beans (Ricinus communis) are important non-edible oilseed plants. cultivated worldwide for its seed oils and its adaptability to growth conditions. In this study. we identified and characterized a total of 48 GRAS genes based on the castor bean genome. Combined with phylogenetic analysis. the castor bean GRAS members were divided into 13 distinct groups. Functional divergence analysis revealed the presence of mostly Type-I functional divergence. The gene structures and conserved motifs. both within and outside the GRAS domain. were characterized. Gene expression analysis. performed in various tissues and under a range of abiotic stress conditions. uncovered the potential functions of GRAS members in regulating plant growth development and stress responses. The results obtained from this study provide valuable information toward understanding the potential molecular mechanisms of GRAS proteins in castor beans.

The seed weight distribution was asymmetrical (negatively skewed) and platykurtic. Out of 101 seeds sawn (seed weight: 33.7-515.8 mg). twenty seven seeds of seed weight varying from 33.7 to 245.5 mg could not germinate. Within the range from 248.6 to 515.8 mg. the seed weight appears not to influence the final seedling emergence percentage. The critical seed weight to affect emergence. therefore. appeared to be around 248 mg. Larger seeds gave rise to larger seedlings. The cotyledons developing from larger seeds were larger in size. The hypocotyl length related with seed size in curvilinear fashion but varied greatly and their lengths could be accounted for only around 10% by the seed weights. The seed size. on the other hand. influenced stem dry weight quite effectively. The dry weight of the seedlings (roots+ stem+ cotyledons+ leaves) increased significantly (r= 0.6582. p< 0.00001) with the increase in seed weight.

Plants were grown in clay pots filled with sandy loam soil and irrigated by saline water (0. 50 and 100mM NaCl) with and without tea compost amendments. Soil evapotranspiration (ET). vegetative and reproductive growth and biochemical parameters were studied in this experiment. ET rate was increased with increasing salinity. whereas. it decreased with application of tea compost under all salinity. Vegetative (shoot height. number of leaves. fresh and dry biomass) and reproductive (number of seeds per plant) growth significantly decline under increasing salinity levels. Tea compost treatment helped in improving all these parameters. Total photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a. b. carotenoids and total chlorophyll content) showed reduction under raising salinity levels. while betterment was recorded with application of tea compost. Organic solutes (soluble sugars. proteins. free amino acids and phenolic content) increased with increasing salinity (50-100mM NaCl). Increased soluble sugars were found with tea compost treatment under non-saline control and decreased in salinity.

Such dopants reduce the recombination of e−cb and h+vb and decrease the band gap or create intra-band gap states. which result in more light absorption. Moreover. the addition of these dopants can alter the surface properties of TiO2 catalyst such as surface acidity and surface area. Therefore. the photocatalysis on modified TiO2 can be promoted using visible light. An important role in this process is played by molecular oxygen and other active species such as O2−. HO2.

Results We found that O. majorana extract (OME) was able to inhibit the viability of the MDA-MB-231 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The effect of OME on cellular viability was further confirmed by the inhibition of colony growth. We showed. depending on the concentration used. that OME elicited different effects on the MDA-MB 231 cells. Concentrations of 150 and 300 µg/mL induced an accumulation of apoptotic–resistant population of cells arrested in mitotis and overexpressing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. p21 and the inhibitor of apoptosis. survivin. On the other hand. higher concentrations of OME (450 and 600 µg/mL) triggered a massive apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway. including the activation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). caspase 8. caspase 3. and cleavage of PARP. downregulation of survivin as well as depletion of the mutant p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore. OME induced an upregulation of γ-H2AX. a marker of double strand DNA breaks and an overall histone H3 and H4 hyperacetylation.

This review encompasses the most important spectroscopic studies of different azo dyes categorized by their structures within the last few years (2010–2014).

It provides a brief account of solvent–dye interactions and their effect on the spectral behavior. The factors that affect solvatochromism are discussed. Some of these factors are inherent to the dye molecule. such as equilibria of tautomer/resonance structures and substituent effects. Others are associated to the solvent properties like solvent polarity. stabilization of charges in the solvation sphere and solvent interactions with the dye in the ground and excited state. The effect of temperature on the solvent–dye interactions is also examined. Another important aspect of solvatochromic studies. namely the fitting of spectroscopic values to solvent parameters and the use of mathematical models to correlate with polarity scales. is also highlighted.,True,-dDF-NAAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,33,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286013002731,4400000890390990624,/scholar?cites=4400000890390990624,,,0,0,0

Two alleles of Avr3a encode secreted proteins that differ in only three amino acid residues. two of which are in the mature protein. Avirulent isolates carry the Avr3a allele. which encodes AVR3aKI (containing amino acids C19. K80 and I103). whereas virulent isolates express only the virulence allele avr3a. encoding AVR3aEM (S19.

1100171,A catalogue of the effector secretome of plant pathogenic oomycetes,2006,Sophien Kamoun,44,,,,,The oomycetes form a phylogenetically distinct group of eukaryotic microorganisms that includes some of the most notorious pathogens of plants. Oomycetes accomplish parasitic colonization of plants by modulating host cell defenses through an array of disease effector proteins. The biology of effectors is poorly understood but tremendous progress has been made in recent years. This review classifies and catalogues the effector secretome of oomycetes.

We posit. however. that guarded effector targets are evolutionarily unstable in plant populations polymorphic for resistance (R) genes. Depending on the absence or presence of the R gene. guarded effector targets are subject to opposing selection forces (1) to evade manipulation by effectors (weaker interaction) and (2) to improve perception of effectors (stronger interaction). Duplication of the effector target gene or independent evolution of a target mimic could relax evolutionary constraints and result in a decoy that would be solely involved in effector perception.

Until recently. available tools for introducing site-specific double strand DNA breaks were restricted to zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TAL effector nucleases (TALENs).

Breeding broad-spectrum disease resistance (R) genes into potato (Solanum tuberosum) is the best strategy for genetically managing late blight but current approaches are slow and inefficient. We used a repertoire of effector genes predicted computationally from the P. infestans genome to accelerate the identification. functional characterization. and cloning of potentially broad-spectrum R genes. An initial set of 54 effectors containing a signal peptide and a RXLR motif was profiled for activation of innate immunity (avirulence or Avr activity) on wild Solanum species and tentative Avr candidates were identified. The RXLR effector family IpiO induced hypersensitive responses (HR) in S. stoloniferum. S. papita and the more distantly related S. bulbocastanum. the source of the R gene Rpi-blb1. Genetic studies with S. stoloniferum showed cosegregation of resistance to P. infestans and response to IpiO. Transient co-expression of IpiO with Rpi-blb1 in a heterologous Nicotiana benthamiana system identified IpiO as Avr-blb1. A candidate gene approach led to the rapid cloning of S. stoloniferum Rpi-sto1 and S. papita Rpi-pta1. which are functionally equivalent to Rpi-blb1.

INF1 elicitin. INF1 induces a hypersensitive response in a restricted number of plants. particularly those of the genus Nicotiana. In virulence assays with different P. infestans isolates. five Nicotiana species displayed resistance responses.

Plant nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) immunoreceptors recognize specific pathogen effectors directly or indirectly. Little is known about how NB-LRR proteins recognize effectors of filamentous plant pathogens. such as Phytophthora infestans. AVR2 belongs to a family of 13 sequence-divergent P. infestans RXLR effectors that are differentially recognized by members of the R2 NB-LRR family in Solanum demissum. We report that the putative plant phosphatase BSU-LIKE PROTEIN1 (BSL1) is required for R2-mediated perception of AVR2 and resistance to P. infestans. AVR2 associates with BSL1 and mediates the interaction of BSL1 with R2 in planta. possibly through the formation of a ternary complex.

Haustoria are thought to enable the secretion of effector proteins into the plant cells. Haustorium biogenesis. therefore. is critical for pathogen accommodation in the host tissue. Haustoria are enveloped by a specialized host-derived membrane. the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM). which is distinct from the plant plasma membrane. The mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of the EHM are unknown. Remarkably. several plasma membrane-localized proteins are excluded from the EHM. but the remorin REM1.3 accumulates around P. infestans haustoria.

1100207,The Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans translocates the CRN8 kinase into host plant cells,2012,Mireille Van Damme and Tolga O Bozkurt and Cahid Cakir and Sebastian Schornack and Jan Sklenar and Alexandra ME Jones and Sophien Kamoun,8,PLoS Pathog,8,e1002875,Public Library of Science,Phytopathogenic oomycetes. such as Phytophthora infestans. secrete an arsenal of effector proteins that modulate plant innate immunity to enable infection. We describe CRN8. a host-translocated effector of P. infestans that has kinase activity in planta. CRN8 is a modular protein of the CRN effector family. The C-terminus of CRN8 localizes to the host nucleus and triggers cell death when the protein is expressed in planta. Cell death induction by CRN8 is dependent on its localization to the plant nucleus. which requires a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS). The C-terminal sequence of CRN8 has similarity to a serine/threonine RD kinase domain. We demonstrated that CRN8 is a functional RD kinase and that its auto-phosphorylation is dependent on an intact catalytic site. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CRN8 forms a dimer or multimer. Heterologous expression of CRN8 in planta resulted in enhanced virulence by P. infestans. In contrast. in planta expression of the dominant-negative CRN8R469A;D470A resulted in reduced P. infestans infection. further implicating CRN8 in virulence. Overall. our results indicate that similar to animal parasites. plant pathogens also translocate biochemically active kinase effectors inside host cells.,True,HivuxGAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,85,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002875,7392232157553766961,/scholar?cites=7392232157553766961,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002875,0,0,0

However. our knowledge of PTI suppression by filamentous plant pathogens. i.e. fungi and oomycetes. remains fragmentary. Previous work revealed that the co-receptor BAK1/SERK3 contributes to basal immunity against the potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Moreover BAK1/SERK3 is required for the cell death induced by P. infestans elicitin INF1. a protein with characteristics of PAMPs. The P. infestans host-translocated RXLR-WY effector AVR3a is known to supress INF1-mediated cell death by binding the plant E3 ligase CMPG1. In contrast. AVR3aKI-Y147del. a deletion mutant of the C-terminal tyrosine of AVR3a. fails to bind CMPG1 and does not suppress INF1-mediated cell death. Here. we studied the extent to which AVR3a and its variants perturb additional BAK1/SERK3-dependent PTI responses in N. benthamiana using the elicitor/receptor pair flg22/FLS2 as a model. We found that all tested variants of AVR3a suppress defense responses triggered by flg22 and reduce internalization of activated FLS2. Moreover. we discovered that AVR3a associates with the Dynamin-Related Protein 2 (DRP2). a plant GTPase implicated in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly. silencing of DRP2 impaired ligand-induced FLS2 internalization but did not affect internalization of the growth receptor BRI1.

This revealed that the NRC4 N-terminal 29 amino acids are sufficient to induce hypersensitive cell death. This region is defined by the consensus MADAxVSFxVxKLxxLLxxEx (MADA motif) that is conserved at the N-termini of NRC family proteins and ~20% of coiled-coil (CC)-type plant NLRs. The MADA motif matches the N-terminal α1 helix of Arabidopsis NLR protein ZAR1. which undergoes a conformational switch during resistosome activation.

Here. we show that during infection. ATG8CL/Joka2 labelled defense-related autophagosomes are diverted toward the perimicrobial host membrane to restrict pathogen growth. PexRD54 also localizes to autophagosomes across the perimicrobial membrane. consistent with the view that the pathogen remodels host-microbe interface by co-opting the host autophagy machinery. Furthermore. we show that the host-pathogen interface is a hotspot for autophagosome biogenesis. Notably. overexpression of the early autophagosome biogenesis protein ATG9 enhances plant immunity.

Like most plant parasites. aphids require intimate associations with their host plants to gain access to nutrients. Aphid feeding induces responses such as clogging of phloem sieve elements and callose formation. which are suppressed by unknown molecules. probably proteins. in aphid saliva. Therefore. it is likely that aphids. like plant pathogens. deliver proteins (effectors) inside their hosts to modulate host cell processes. suppress plant defenses. and promote infestation. We exploited publicly available aphid salivary gland expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to apply a functional genomics approach for identification of candidate effectors from Myzus persicae (green peach aphid). based on common features of plant pathogen effectors.

Yet they both produce secretory virulence and pathogenic proteins that alter host cell functions. In P. falciparum. export of parasite proteins to the host erythrocyte is mediated by leader sequences shown to contain a host-targeting (HT) motif centered on an RxLx (E. D. or Q) core: this motif appears to signify a major pathogenic export pathway with hundreds of putative effectors. Here we show that a secretory protein of P. infestans. which is perceived by plant disease resistance proteins and induces hypersensitive plant cell death. contains a leader sequence that is equivalent to the Plasmodium HT-leader in its ability to export fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the P. falciparum parasite to the host erythrocyte. This export is dependent on an RxLR sequence conserved in P. infestans leaders. as well as in leaders of all ten secretory oomycete proteins shown to function inside plant cells. The RxLR motif is also detected in hundreds of secretory proteins of P. infestans. Phytophthora sojae. and Phytophthora ramorum and has high value in predicting host-targeted leaders. A consensus motif further reveals E/D residues enriched within ~25 amino acids downstream of the RxLR. which are also needed for export.

1100237,Using hierarchical clustering of secreted protein families to classify and rank candidate effectors of rust fungi,2012,Diane GO Saunders and Joe Win and Liliana M Cano and Les J Szabo and Sophien Kamoun and Sylvain Raffaele,7,PloS one,1,e29847,Public Library of Science,Rust fungi are obligate biotrophic pathogens that cause considerable damage on crop plants. Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. the causal agent of wheat stem rust. and Melampsora larici-populina. the poplar leaf rust pathogen. have strong deleterious impacts on wheat and poplar wood production. respectively. Filamentous pathogens such as rust fungi secrete molecules called disease effectors that act as modulators of host cell physiology and can suppress or trigger host immunity. Current knowledge on effectors from other filamentous plant pathogens can be exploited for the characterisation of effectors in the genome of recently sequenced rust fungi. We designed a comprehensive in silico analysis pipeline to identify the putative effector repertoire from the genome of two plant pathogenic rust fungi. The pipeline is based on the observation that known effector proteins from filamentous pathogens have at least one of the following properties: (i) contain a secretion signal. (ii) are encoded by in planta induced genes. (iii) have similarity to haustorial proteins. (iv) are small and cysteine rich. (v) contain a known effector motif or a nuclear localization signal. (vi) are encoded by genes with long intergenic regions. (vii) contain internal repeats. and (viii) do not contain PFAM domains. except those associated with pathogenicity. We used Markov clustering and hierarchical clustering to classify protein families of rust pathogens and rank them according to their likelihood of being effectors. Using this approach. we identified eight families of candidate effectors that we consider of high value for functional characterization.

However. how plant pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes is unknown. Here. we show that PexRD54. an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans. binds host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes and interferes with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense. Thus. a plant pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10856.001,True,Tkj-6eYAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC,137,https://elifesciences.org/articles/10856,12956716370876919607,/scholar?cites=12956716370876919607,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/10856.pdf,0,0,0

We show that 26% of the Pba genome exhibited differential transcription in a QS (expI-) mutant. compared to the wild-type. suggesting that QS may make a greater contribution to pathogenesis than previously thought. We identify novel components of the QS regulon. including the Type I and II secretion systems. which are involved in the secretion of PCWDEs; a novel Type VI secretion system (T6SS) and its predicted substrates Hcp and VgrG; more than 70 known or putative regulators. some of which have been demonstrated to control pathogenesis and. remarkably. the Type III secretion system and associated effector proteins. and coronafacoyl-amide conjugates. both of which play roles in the manipulation of plant defences. We show that the T6SS and a novel potential regulator. VirS. are required for full virulence in Pba. and propose a model placing QS at the apex of a regulatory hierarchy controlling the later stages of disease progression in Pba.

The Crinkler (CRN) gene family encodes a ubiquitous but understudied class of effectors with possible but as of yet unknown roles in infection. To appreciate CRN effector function in Phytophthora. we devised a simple Crn gene identification and annotation pipeline to improve effector prediction rates. We predicted 84 full-length CRN coding genes and assessed CRN effector domain diversity in sequenced Oomycete genomes. These analyses revealed evidence of CRN domain innovation in Phytophthora and expansion in the Peronosporales. We performed gene expression analyses to validate and define two classes of CRN effectors. each possibly contributing to infection at different stages. CRN localisation studies revealed that P. capsici CRN effector domains target the nucleus and accumulate in specific sub-nuclear compartments. Phenotypic analyses showed that few CRN domains induce necrosis when expressed in planta and that one cell death inducing effector. enhances P. capsici virulence on Nicotiana benthamiana. These results suggest that the CRN protein family form an important class of intracellular effectors that target the host nucleus during infection. These results combined with domain expansion in hemi-biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. suggests specific contributions to pathogen lifestyles.

We identified three Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). the first in a region encompassing the spike architecture gene Vrs1 on chromosome 2H. the second in an uncharacterised centromeric region on chromosome 3H. and the third in a region of chromosome 5H coinciding with the previously described dwarfing gene Breviaristatum-e (Ari-e). Barley cultivars in North-western Europe largely contain either of two dwarfing genes; Denso on chromosome 3H. a presumed ortholog of the rice green revolution gene OsSd1. or Breviaristatum-e (ari-e) on chromosome 5H.

We have developed a new 50k Illumina Infinium iSelect genotyping array for barley. a cereal crop species of major international importance. The majority of SNPs on the array have been extracted from variants called in exome capture data of a wide range of European barley germplasm. We used the recently published barley pseudomolecule assembly to map the exome capture data. which allowed us to generate markers with accurate physical positions and detailed gene annotation. Markers from an existing and widely used barley 9k Infinium iSelect array were carried over onto the 50k chip for backward compatibility. The array design featured 49.267 SNP markers that converted into 44.040 working assays. of which 43.461 were scorable in GenomeStudio. Of the working assays. 6.251 are from the 9k iSelect platform. We validated the SNPs by comparing the genotype calls from the new array to legacy datasets. Rates of agreement averaged 98.1%. and 93.9% respectively for the legacy 9k iSelect SNP set (Comadran et al.. 2012) and the exome capture SNPs. To test the utility of the 50k chip for genetic mapping. we genotyped a segregating population derived from a Golden Promise x Morex cross (Liu et al.. 2014) and mapped over 14.000 SNPs to genetic positions which showed a near exact correspondence to their known physical positions.

The R genes provide higher but less durable resistance than the quantitative trait loci. Consequently. exploring quantitative or partial resistance has become a favorable alternative for controlling disease. Four quantitative trait loci for partial resistance to leaf rust have been identified in the doubled haploid Steptoe (St)/Morex (Mx) mapping population. Further investigations are required to study the molecular mechanisms underpinning partial resistance and ultimately identify the causal genes.  Methodology/Principal Findings We explored partial resistance to barley leaf rust using a genetical genomics approach. We recorded RNA transcript abundance corresponding to each probe on a 15K Agilent custom barley microarray in seedlings from St and Mx and 144 doubled haploid lines of the St/Mx population. A total of 1154 and 1037 genes were. respectively. identified as being P. hordei-responsive among the St and Mx and differentially expressed between P. hordei-infected St and Mx. Normalized ratios from 72 distant-pair hybridisations were used to map the genetic determinants of variation in transcript abundance by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping generating 15685 eQTL from 9557 genes. Correlation analysis identified 128 genes that were correlated with resistance. of which 89 had eQTL co-locating with the phenotypic quantitative trait loci (pQTL).

Here. we describe the differential regulation of three different BAK1-dependent signaling pathways by a novel allele of BAK1. bak1-5. Innate immune signaling mediated by the BAK1-dependent RKs FLS2 and EFR is severely compromised in bak1-5 mutant plants. However. bak1-5 mutants are not impaired in BR signaling or cell death control. We also show that. in contrast to the RD kinase BRI1. the non-RD kinases FLS2 and EFR have very low kinase activity. and we show that neither was able to trans-phosphorylate BAK1 in vitro. Furthermore. kinase activity for all partners is completely dispensable for the ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS2 or EFR with BAK1 in planta. revealing another pathway specific mechanistic difference. The specific suppression of FLS2- and EFR-dependent signaling in bak1-5 is not due to a differential interaction of BAK1-5 with the respective ligand-binding RK but requires BAK1-5 kinase activity.

Such patterns are recognized by immune receptors that are cytoplasmic or localized at the plasma membrane. Cell surface receptors are represented by receptor-like kinases (RLKs) that frequently contain extracellular leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular kinase domain for activation of downstream signaling. as well as receptor-like proteins (RLPs) that lack this signaling domain. It is therefore hypothesized that RLKs are required for RLPs to activate downstream signaling.

In this study. we quantify and interpret changes in global gene expression patterns in the human prostate gland before. during and after a 12 month broccoli-rich diet.Methods and FindingsVolunteers were randomly assigned to either a broccoli-rich or a pea-rich diet.

Effectors can be recognized by hosts leading to immunity. One such effector is AvrPtoB of Pseudomonas syringae. which degrades host protein kinases. such as tomato Fen. through an E3 ligase domain. Pto kinase. which is highly related to Fen. recognizes AvrPtoB in conjunction with the resistance protein Prf.

AvrPtoB ubiquitinated Fen within the catalytic cleft. leading to its breakdown and loss of the associated Prf protein. Pto avoids this by phosphorylating and inactivating the AvrPtoB E3 domain.

Here we describe the map‐based cloning of DMR6 (At5g24530). which was found to encode a 2‐oxoglutarate (2OG)‐Fe(II) oxygenase of unknown function. DMR6 transcription is locally induced during infections with both compatible and incompatible H. parasitica isolates. High DMR6 transcript levels were also observed in constitutive defense mutants and after treatment with salicylic acid analog BTH. suggesting that DMR6 has a role during plant defense. Expression analysis of dmr6 mutants. using DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR. showed the enhanced expression of a subset of defense‐associated genes. including DMR6 itself. suggesting dmr6‐mediated resistance results from the activation of plant defense responses.

An alternative form of resistance is mediated by recessive downy mildew resistant 1 (dmr1) alleles in Arabidopsis thaliana. Map-based cloning revealed that DMR1 encodes homoserine kinase (HSK). Six independent dmr1 mutants each carry a different amino acid substitution in the HSK protein. Amino acid analysis revealed that dmr1 mutants contain high levels of homoserine that is undetectable in wild-type plants. Surprisingly. the level of amino acids downstream in the aspartate (Asp) pathway was not reduced in dmr1 mutants. Exogenous homoserine does not directly affect pathogen growth but induces resistance when infiltrated in Arabidopsis. We provide evidence that homoserine accumulation in the chloroplast triggers a novel form of downy mildew resistance that is independent of known immune …,True,IuRT3gcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,97,http://www.plantcell.org/content/21/7/2179.short,16214679504299754340,/scholar?cites=16214679504299754340,,http://www.plantcell.org/content/plantcell/21/7/2179.full.pdf,0,0,0

We describe CRN8. a host-translocated effector of P. infestans that has kinase activity in planta. CRN8 is a modular protein of the CRN effector family. The C-terminus of CRN8 localizes to the host nucleus and triggers cell death when the protein is expressed in planta. Cell death induction by CRN8 is dependent on its localization to the plant nucleus. which requires a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS). The C-terminal sequence of CRN8 has similarity to a serine/threonine RD kinase domain. We demonstrated that CRN8 is a functional RD kinase and that its auto-phosphorylation is dependent on an intact catalytic site. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CRN8 forms a dimer or multimer. Heterologous expression of CRN8 in planta resulted in enhanced virulence by P. infestans. In contrast. in planta expression of the dominant-negative CRN8R469A;D470A resulted in reduced P. infestans infection. further implicating CRN8 in virulence. Overall. our results indicate that similar to animal parasites. plant pathogens also translocate biochemically active kinase effectors inside host cells.,True,IuRT3gcAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,85,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002875,7392232157553766961,/scholar?cites=7392232157553766961,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002875,0,0,0

The coordination and regulation of both host and pathogen gene expression is essential for pathogens to infect and cause disease. One mode of gene regulation is RNA silencing. This biological process is widespread in the natural world. present in plants. animals and several pathogens. In RNA silencing. small (20–40 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs (small-RNAs. sRNAs) accumulate and regulate gene expression transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally in a sequence-specific manner.

1100337,Genetic analysis of disease susceptibility in the Arabidopsis-Hyaloperonospora parasitica interaction,2007,MMA van Damme,,,,,,On a global scale the impact and costs of plant diseases on agriculture is enormous. highlighting the importance of the research on this topic. Plant disease is the result of a compatible interaction between plants and adapted pathogens. The knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying compatibility or disease susceptibility is limited. The aim of this study was to identify Arabidopsis genes required for disease susceptibility to the oomycete Hyaloperonospora parasitica. We have undertaken a forward genetics approach to study susceptibility to downy mildew. Seeds of the susceptible Arabidopsis Ler eds1-2 line were mutagenised and twenty independent downy mildew resistant (dmr) Arabidopsis mutants were isolated of which eight were further characterized (described in chapter 2). Three dmr mutants. dmr1. dmr2 and dmr6. showed no induced expression of the defence-associated gene PR-1. and absence of programmed cell death and reactive oxidative intermediates. suggesting they are susceptibility mutants. In contrast. PR-1 expression was elevated in the dmr3. dmr4. and dmr5 mutants indicating that these mutants have an enhanced defence-response. The dmr1. dmr2. dmr5. and dmr6 mutants were still susceptible to other pathogens. such as the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and the fungus Golovinomyces orontii. For two candidate susceptibility mutants. dmr1 and dmr6. the corresponding genes have been cloned (chapters 3 and 4). The DMR1 gene.

Recent studies uncovered the TALe code in which two amino acid residues of each repeat define specific pairing to UPT boxes.• Here we employed the TALe code to predict potential UPT boxes in TALeinduced host promoters and analyzed these via b-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).• We demonstrate that the Xa13. OsTFX1 and Os11N3 promoters from rice are induced directly by the Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae TALes PthXo1. PthXo6 and AvrXa7. respectively.

The related plant Nicotiana benthamiana is a model system to study plant-pathogen interactions. and the susceptibility of N. benthamiana to Phytophthora species varies from susceptible to resistant. Little is known about the extent to which plant basal immunity. mediated by membrane receptors that recognise conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). contributes to P. infestans resistance.   Principal Findings We found that different species of Phytophthora have varying degrees of virulence on N. benthamiana ranging from avirulence (incompatible interaction) to moderate virulence through to full aggressiveness. The leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) BAK1/SERK3 is a major modulator of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis thaliana and N. benthamiana. We cloned two NbSerk3 homologs. NbSerk3A and NbSerk3B. from N. benthamiana based on sequence similarity to the A. thaliana gene. N. benthamiana plants silenced for NbSerk3 showed markedly enhanced susceptibility to P. infestans infection but were not altered in resistance to Phytophthora mirabilis. a sister species of P. infestans that specializes on a different host plant. Furthermore. silencing of NbSerk3 reduced the cell death response triggered by the INF1. a secreted P. infestans protein with features of PAMPs.

1100393,Amplification of cox2 (~ 620 bp) from 2 mg of up to 129 years old herbarium specimens. comparing 19 extraction methods and 15 polymerases,2008,Sabine Telle and Marco Thines,3,PLoS One,10,e3584,Public Library of Science,During the past years an increasing number of studies have focussed on the use of herbarium specimens for molecular phylogenetic investigations and several comparative studies have been published. However. in the studies reported so far usually rather large amounts of material (typically around 100 mg) were sampled for DNA extraction. This equals an amount roughly equivalent to 8 cm2 of a medium thick leaf. For investigating the phylogeny of plant pathogens. such large amounts of tissue are usually not available or would irretrievably damage the specimens. Through systematic comparison of 19 DNA extraction protocols applied to only 2 mg of infected leaf tissue and testing 15 different DNA polymerases. we could successfully amplify a mitochondrial DNA region (cox2; ~620 bp) from herbarium specimens well over a hundred years old. We conclude that DNA extraction and the choice of DNA polymerase are crucial factors for successful PCR amplification from small samples of historic herbarium specimens. Through a combination of suitable DNA extraction protocols and DNA polymerases. only a fraction of the preserved plant material commonly used is necessary for successful PCR amplification. This facilitates the potential use of a far larger number of preserved specimens for molecular phylogenetic investigation and provides access to a wealth of genetic information in preserved in specimens deposited in herbaria around the world without reducing their scientific or historical value.,True,8jgvb8IAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,91,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003584,11259987676791614609,/scholar?cites=11259987676791614609,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003584,0,0,0

An ortholog of Yap1. MoAP1. was recently identified from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae genome. We found that MoAP1 is highly expressed in conidia and during invasive hyphal growth. The Moap1 mutant was sensitive to H2O2. similar to S. cerevisiae yap1 mutants. and MoAP1 complemented Yap1 function in resistance to H2O2. albeit partially. The Moap1 mutant also exhibited various defects in aerial hyphal growth. mycelial branching. conidia formation. the production of extracellular peroxidases and laccases. and melanin pigmentation. Consequently. the Moap1 mutant was unable to infect the host plant. The MoAP1-eGFP fusion protein is localized inside the nucleus upon exposure to H2O2. suggesting that MoAP1 also functions as a redox sensor. Moreover. through RNA sequence analysis. many MoAP1-regulated genes were identified. including several novel ones that were also involved in pathogenicity. Disruption of respective MGG_01662 (MoAAT) and MGG_02531 (encoding hypothetical protein) genes did not result in any detectable changes in conidial germination and appressorium formation but reduced pathogenicity. whereas the mutant strains of MGG_01230 (MoSSADH) and MGG_15157 (MoACT) showed marketed reductions in aerial hyphal growth. mycelial branching. and loss of conidiation as well as pathogenicity. similar to the Moap1 mutant.

Avirulence (Avr) effectors that trigger plant ETI as a result of recognition by plant resistance (R) gene products have been identified in many plant pathogenic oomycetes and fungi. However. the virulence functions of oomycete and fungal Avr effectors remain largely unknown. Here. we combined bioinformatics and genetics to identify Avr3b. a new Avr gene from Phytophthora sojae. an oomycete pathogen that causes soybean root rot. Avr3b encodes a secreted protein with the RXLR host-targeting motif and C-terminal W and Nudix hydrolase motifs. Some isolates of P. sojae evade perception by the soybean R gene Rps3b through sequence mutation in Avr3b and lowered transcript accumulation. Transient expression of Avr3b in Nicotiana benthamiana increased susceptibility to P. capsici and P. parasitica. with significantly reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) around invasion sites. Biochemical assays confirmed that Avr3b is an ADP-ribose/NADH pyrophosphorylase. as predicted from the Nudix motif. Deletion of the Nudix motif of Avr3b abolished enzyme activity. Mutation of key residues in Nudix motif significantly impaired Avr3b virulence function but not the avirulence activity. Some Nudix hydrolases act as negative regulators of plant immunity. and thus Avr3b might be delivered into host cells as a Nudix hydrolase to impair host immunity.

Now. we have identified the Phytophthora sojae avirulence genes Avr1a and Avr3a and demonstrate how each of these Avr genes display copy number variation in different strains of P. sojae. The Avr1a locus is a tandem array of four near-identical copies of a 5.2 kb DNA segment. Two copies encoding Avr1a are deleted in some P. sojae strains. causing changes in virulence. In other P. sojae strains. differences in transcription of Avr1a result in gain of virulence. For Avr3a. there are four copies or one copy of this gene. depending on the P. sojae strain. In P. sojae strains with multiple copies of Avr3a. this gene occurs within a 10.8 kb segmental duplication that includes four other genes. Transcriptional differences of the Avr3a gene among P. sojae strains cause changes in virulence. To determine the extent of duplication within the superfamily of secreted proteins that includes Avr1a and Avr3a. predicted RXLR effector genes from the P. sojae and the P. ramorum genomes were compared by counting trace file matches from whole genome shotgun sequences. The results indicate that multiple. near-identical copies of RXLR effector genes are prevalent in oomycete genomes. We propose that multiple copies of particular RXLR effectors may contribute to pathogen fitness.

The avirulence (Avr) genes of P. sojae control race-cultivar compatibility. In this study. we identify the P. sojae Avr3c gene and show that it encodes a predicted RXLR effector protein of 220 amino acids. Sequence and transcriptional data were compared for predicted RXLR effectors occurring in the vicinity of Avr4/6. as genetic linkage of Avr3c and Avr4/6 was previously suggested. Mapping of DNA markers in a F2 population was performed to determine whether selected RXLR effector genes co-segregate with the Avr3c phenotype. The results pointed to one RXLR candidate gene as likely to encode Avr3c. This was verified by testing selected genes by a co-bombardment assay on soybean plants with Rps3c. thus demonstrating functionality and confirming the identity of Avr3c. The Avr3c gene together with eight other predicted genes are part of a repetitive segment of 33.7 kb. Three near-identical copies of this segment occur in a tandem array. In P. sojae strain P6497. two identical copies of Avr3c occur within the repeated segments whereas the third copy of this RXLR effector has diverged in sequence. The Avr3c gene is expressed during the early stages of infection in all P. sojae strains examined. Virulent alleles of Avr3c that differ in amino acid sequence were identified in other strains of P. sojae. Gain of virulence was acquired through mutation and subsequent sequence exchanges between the two copies of Avr3c. The results illustrate the importance of segmental duplications and RXLR effector evolution in the control of race-cultivar compatibility in the P …,True,-8X8AUUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,108,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005556,14179620916450388258,/scholar?cites=14179620916450388258,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005556,0,0,0

University of California,The doubly labeled water method for measuring CO2 production and water flux rates is being used with increasing frequency in studies of energy and material balance in animals living in their natural habitats. Nathan Lifson and his colleagues originated and developed this method beginning more than 30 years ago. and they summarized their efforts in 1966 (Lifson and McClintock 1966). However. few investigators used this method during the 1960s. apparently because of the high costs and technical difficulties involved. More recently. isotope costs have declined as much as 90X (for 18O). technical aspects of sample analysis have been streamlined and improved (Wood et al. 1975). and potential errors have been evaluated (Nagy 1980.

NY,The measurable variations in the isotopic composition of strontium in ecosystems. unlike those of the lighter elements discussed in this volume. are entirely caused by the mixing of strontium derived from different geologic regimes of differing isotopic composition and are not due to fractionation by biological processes. The values and variation of strontium isotope ratios within an ecosystem can therefore yield information about the sources of strontium to and the patterns of strontium flow within the ecosystem. The lack of measurable isotopic fractionation of strontium means that information about processes is not obtainable directly. but must be inferred from mixing calculations. The lack of measurable isotopic fractionation also means that there must be variations in isotopic composition between various sources of strontium to an ecosystem in order for there to be any internal variation in isotopic composition.,True,vQ00fbMAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C,267,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-3498-2_28,1595394216145695277,/scholar?cites=1595394216145695277,,,0,0,0

A central issue is the extent to which reproduction is fuelled by long‐term energy stores (“capital” breeding) versus recently‐acquired resources (“income” breeding). Our data on free‐living aspic vipers show that there is no simple answer to this question: reproductive frequency is determined by long‐term energy stores. offspring size is influenced by maternal food intake immediately before ovulation. and litter size is influenced by both long‐term stores and short‐term energy acquisition. Thus. offspring size in free‐living vipers reflects the mother's energy balance over the preceding year (via a trade‐off between litter size and offspring size) as well as her energy balance in the current breeding season.

Children are strongly influenced by the media. notably the internet. about biodiversity and conservation issues. However. most media focus on a few iconic. appealing. and usually exotic species.

Focusing our analyses on local versus exotic species. we examined the level of knowledge and the level of diversity of the animals that French schoolchildren are willing to protect. and whether these perceptions are mainly guided by information available in the internet. For that. we collected and compared two complementary data sets: 1) a questionnaire was administered to schoolchildren to assess their knowledge and consideration to protect animals. 2) an internet content analysis (i.e. Google searching sessions using keywords) was performed to assess which animals are the most often represented. Our results suggest that the knowledge of children and their consideration to protect animal are mainly limited to internet contents. represented by a few exotic and charismatic species.

Data from an eight‐year mark–recapture study on free‐ranging vipers suggest that potential costs of reproduction were high for these animals. in terms of survival as well as growth and energy storage. Females that reproduced experienced higher mortality rates than nonreproductive females and. hence. exhibited a tendency toward semelparity. grew less. and devoted most of their energy stores to reproduction. Both the depletion of body reserves and the low survival of reproductive females translated into significant costs (decrements of lifetime reproductive success [LRS]).

Males allocate relatively little to gamete production and. thus. can reproduce successfully with only minor energy investment. In contrast. females of many species experience high fecundity-independent costs of reproduction (such as migration to nesting sites). so they need to amass substantial energy reserves before initiating reproductive activity. Thus. we expect that the relationship between energy reserves and the intensity of reproductive behavior involves a threshold effect in females. but a gradual (or no) effect in males.

Los Angeles,Physiological ecology can be broadly defined as the study of the physiological. morphological. and behavioral attributes by which organisms interact with the chemical and physical aspects of their environments. A classical paradigm of physiological ecology holds that each population of animals has evolved physiological adaptations to the particular climatic and physiographic conditions of its geographic distribution. Such adaptations. which allow individuals to survive and reproduce. naturally are most striking in species which inhabit harsh or physiologically challenging environments (Bartholomew 1964). The Mojave desert of southwestern North America is such an environment. Animals inhabiting the Mojave desert must cope with a severe scarcity of water over most of the year. as well as the extreme seasonal temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations characteristic of the region. These challenges to the maintenance of homeostasis are particularly formidable for herbivorous animals. because their food resources usually become almost completely desiccated by the middle of the warm season. and also typically are high in electrolytes. which can complicate water stress problems (Nagy 1973).

A classical paradigm of physiological ecology holds that each population of animals has evolved physiological adaptations to the particular climatic and physiographic conditions of its geographic distribution. Such adaptations. which allow individuals to survive and reproduce. naturally are most striking in species which inhabit harsh or physiologically challenging environments (Bartholomew 1964). The Mojave desert of southwestern North America is such an environment.

This problem is extensively recognized but not for invalid or incorrectly identified species. sample mixed-up. and contamination. DNA barcoding is a powerful tool for identifying and confirming species and one very important application involves forensics. In this study. we use DNA barcoding to detect erroneous sequences in GenBank by evaluating deep intraspecific and shallow interspecific divergences to discover possible taxonomic problems and other sources of error. We use the mitochondrial DNA gene encoding cytochrome b (Cytb) from turtles to test the utility of barcoding for pinpointing potential errors. This gene is widely used in phylogenetic studies of the speciose group. Intraspecific variation is usually less than 2.0% and in most cases it is less than 1.0%. In comparison. most species differ by more than 10.0% in our dataset. Overlapping intra- and interspecific percentages of variation mainly involve problematic identifications of species and outdated taxonomies. Further. we detect identical problems in Cytb from Insectivora and Chiroptera. Upon applying this strategy to 47.524 mammalian CoxI sequences. we resolve a suite of potentially problematic sequences. Our study reveals that erroneous sequences are not rare in GenBank and that the DNA barcoding can serve to confirm sequencing accuracy and discover problems such as misidentified species. inaccurate taxonomies. contamination. and potential errors in sequencing.,True,QEe4n9kAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC,129,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057125,13039243173882622494,/scholar?cites=13039243173882622494,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057125,0,0,0

With these large quantities of data comes the increasing challenge regarding the best methods of analysis. We review the current trends in molecular phylogenetic analysis. focusing specifically on the topics of multiple sequence alignment and methods of tree reconstruction. We suggest that traditional methods are inadequate for these highly heterogeneous data sets and that researchers employ newer more sophisticated search algorithms in their analyses.

UT,An investigation of the genealogical relationships among 30 species of rattlesnakes. including all three species of Sistrurus and 27 species of Crotalus. used sequences of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b. ND5. 12S RNA. tRNAVal. and 16S RNA genes. Two species of Agkistrodon were used as outgroup taxa. The data were analyzed using maximum parsimony methods. Significant character covariance was located using nodal permutation tail probabilities. Support for clades was evaluated using jackknife monophyly index. bootstrapping. decay index. and successive approximations. Analysis of the total combined unweighted data yielded two most-parsimonious trees. A preferred tree. which was not the most parsimonious explanation of the sequence data. was obtained by weighting transversions three times transitions. and using S. catenatus and S. miliarius as a functional outgroup. Our analysis failed to find support for any species group as currently defined. Evidence for the paraphyly of Sistrurus was strong and S. ravus is considered to be a species of Crotalus. The C. triseriatus group. composed of largely central and southern Mexican montane species. was paraphyletic and contained two groups of taxa. one of which includes the Sidewinder. C. cerastes.

1100526,Parallel evolution of auditory genes for echolocation in bats and toothed whales,2012,Yong-Yi Shen and Lu Liang and Gui-Sheng Li and Robert W Murphy and Ya-Ping Zhang,8,PLoS Genetics,6,e1002788,Public Library of Science,The ability of bats and toothed whales to echolocate is a remarkable case of convergent evolution. Previous genetic studies have documented parallel evolution of nucleotide sequences in Prestin and KCNQ4. both of which are associated with voltage motility during the cochlear amplification of signals. Echolocation involves complex mechanisms. The most important factors include cochlear amplification. nerve transmission. and signal re-coding. Herein. we screen three genes that play different roles in this auditory system. Cadherin 23 (Cdh23) and its ligand. protocadherin 15 (Pcdh15). are essential for bundling motility in the sensory hair. Otoferlin (Otof) responds to nerve signal transmission in the auditory inner hair cell. Signals of parallel evolution occur in all three genes in the three groups of echolocators—two groups of bats (Yangochiroptera and Rhinolophoidea) plus the dolphin. Significant signals of positive selection also occur in Cdh23 in the Rhinolophoidea and dolphin. and Pcdh15 in Yangochiroptera. In addition. adult echolocating bats have higher levels of Otof expression in the auditory cortex than do their embryos and non-echolocation bats. Cdh23 and Pcdh15 encode the upper and lower parts of tip-links. and both genes show signals of convergent evolution and positive selection in echolocators. implying that they may co-evolve to optimize cochlear amplification. Convergent evolution and expression patterns of Otof suggest the potential role of nerve and brain in echolocation. Our synthesis of gene sequence and gene expression analyses reveals that positive selection. parallel evolution. and perhaps co-evolution and gene …,True,QEe4n9kAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC,93,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002788,2402435425294493701,/scholar?cites=2402435425294493701,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002788,0,0,0

Adding to the previous arguments. four problems are discussed: (1) independent losses of relatively primitive alleles are considered as synapomorphies; (2) loci having a greater number of alleles are given a correspondingly higher weight in the tree reconstruction; (3) unnecessary character conflicts arise when no alleles are shared between the ingroup and outgropu; and (4) polymorphism in the outgropu may result in erroenous hypotheses. This coding method can result in the resolution of a less parsimonious solution than could be obtained by using the locus as the character.

The desert tortoise. Gopherus agassizii. inhabits the Mojave and Sonoran deserts of North America. Desert tortoises face many threats to their continued survival. including habitat loss and fragmentation. I used mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers to examine genetic structure within and among populations of desert tortoises. I found that both the Mojave and Sonoran populations of desert tortoise exhibit similar patterns of population genetic structure. Gene flow among localities within each region is part of the evolutionary history of the desert tortoise and dispersal events probably play an important role in the long-term maintenance of populations. Movement barriers caused by anthropogenic landscape changes have the potential to effect desert tortoise population viability.

Unlike disease severity. age and sex played lesser roles in serological responses. All cases. including asymptomatic individuals. seroconverted by 2 weeks post-PCR confirmation. RBD- and S2-specific and neutralizing antibody titers remained elevated and stable for at least 2-3 months post-onset. whereas those against N were more variable with rapid declines in many samples. Testing of 5882 self-recruited members of the local community demonstrated that 1.24% of individuals showed antibody reactivity to RBD. However. 18% (13/73) of these putative seropositive samples failed to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each of the neutralizing. but only 1 of the non-neutralizing samples. also displayed potent reactivity to S2.

A total of 1.476 species in 14 families are currently known from all zoogeographical regions (except Antarctica). including 1.306 species in eight exclusively freshwater families (Pseudothelphusidae. Trichodactylidae. Potamonautidae. Deckeniidae. Platythelphusidae. Potamidae. Gecarcinucidae and Parathelphusidae). Estimates of true freshwater crab diversity including likely numbers of undescribed taxa suggest that the field remains largely in a ‘‘discovery’’phase.

For organisms exhibiting a vicariant biogeographic pattern—achieving their current distribution by riding on the plates of former supercontinents—this view is largely inspired by the belief that Pangaea lacked geographical or ecological barriers. or that extinctions and dispersal would have erased any biogeographic signal since the early Mesozoic. We here present a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of Onychophora (velvet worms). an ancient and exclusively terrestrial panarthropod group distributed throughout former Pangaean landmasses.

The cichlids in the East African lakes have received considerable scientific attention. leading to an increase of our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of these fish. as well as of the mechanisms underlying the rapid radiations of their species flocks (Kocher. 2004; Kornfield and Smith. 2000). Species relationships and evolutionary processes in other endemic species-rich groups in Africa’s Rift lakes. however. are less well studied and remain poorly understood (but see Martens. 1994; Michel. 2000; West and Michel. 2000; Wilson et al.. 2004). Lake Tanganyika is the only lake in the world that harbors a decapod crustacean radiation (Martens and Schön. 1999). The lake and its catchment are a hotspot of freshwater crab biodiversity. representing 44% of the species known from East Africa (N. Cumberlidge. personal communication). Of the 10 species of freshwater crabs endemic to Lake Tanganyika. nine are in the family Platythelphusidae (Cumberlidge et al.. 1999; Marijnissen et al.. 2004) and one.

However. few studies have examined the extent to which populations are genetically structured.

Cladogram estimation.,1992,Alan R Templeton and Keith A Crandall and Charles F Sing,132,Genetics,2,619-633,Oxford University Press,We previously developed a cladistic approach to identify subsets of haplotypes defined by restriction endonuclease mapping or DNA sequencing that are associated with significant phenotypic deviations. Our approach was limited to segments of DNA in which little recombination occurs. In such cases. a cladogram can be constructed from the restriction site or sequence data that represents the evolutionary steps that interrelate the observed haplotypes. The cladogram is used to define a nested statistical design to identify mutational steps associated with significant phenotypic deviations. The central assumption behind this strategy is that any undetected mutation causing a phenotypic effect is embedded within the same evolutionary history that is represented by the cladogram. The power of this approach depends upon the confidence one has in the particular cladogram used to draw inferences.

This endeavour has often been accomplished by the use of genealogies upon which geographical information is incorporated in the search of association among genetic variation and geographical distribution (see Avise 1998). However. a particular population genetic structure can be the result of distinct processes acting in different points through time and space and may reflect historical rather than ongoing population level processes (Gerber & Templeton 1996). Templeton (1993) and Templeton et al.(1995) describe a methodology (cladistic nested analysis) in which population structure can be separated from population history when it is assessed through rigorous and objective statistical tests upon an estimated nested cladogram (see Templeton et al. 1992). GeoDis is a computer program that implements the cladistic nested analysis. The simplest test for geographical association is to treat sample locations as categorical variables. An exact permutational contingency test is performed for any clade at each nesting level.

Single individuals from both organisms have numts of the COI gene. many of which are highly divergent from orthologous mtDNA sequences. and DNA barcoding analysis incorrectly overestimates the number of unique species based on the standard metric of 3% sequence …,True,nccuYroAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,840,https://www.pnas.org/content/105/36/13486.short,15782870851741272519,/scholar?cites=15782870851741272519,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/105/36/13486.full.pdf,0,0,0
1100596,The causes and consequences of HIV evolution,2004,Andrew Rambaut and David Posada and Keith A Crandall and Edward C Holmes,5,,1,52-61,Nature Publishing Group,Understanding the evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is crucial for reconstructing its origin. deciphering its interaction with the immune system and developing effective control strategies. Although it is clear that HIV-1 and HIV-2 originated in African primates. dating their transmission to humans is problematic. especially because of frequent recombination. Our ability to predict the spread of drug-resistance and immune-escape mutations depends on understanding how HIV evolution differs within and among hosts and on the role played by positive selection. For this purpose. extensive sampling of HIV genetic diversity is required. and is essential for informing the design of HIV vaccines.,True,nccuYroAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,736,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1246,16260090643021812141,/scholar?cites=16260090643021812141,,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1246,0,0,0

Inc.,We have developed a modified BOOTSCAN algorithm that may be used to screen nucleotide sequence alignments for evidence of recombination without prior identification of nonrecombinant reference sequences. The algorithm is fast and includes a Bonferroni corrected statistical test of recombination to circumvent the multiple testing problems encountered when using the BOOTSCAN method to explore alignments for evidence of recombination.

While discussion of the various methodologies has previously been restricted mostly to taxonomists. the demarcation of species is also crucial for conservation biology. Unfortunately. different methods of diagnosing species can arrive at different entities. Most prominently. it is widely thought that use of a phylogenetic species concept may lead to recognition of a far greater number of much less inclusive units. As a result. studies of the same group of organisms can produce not only different species identities but also different species range and number of individuals. To assess the impact of different definitions on conservation issues. we collected instances from the literature where a group of organisms was categorized both under phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic concepts.

Traditional phylogenetic methods assume that a single history underlies the data. If recombination is present. can we expect the inferred phylogeny to represent any of the underlying evolutionary histories? We examined this question by applying traditional phylogenetic reconstruction methods to simulated recombinant sequence alignments. The effect of recombination on phylogeny estimation depended on the relatedness of the sequences involved in the recombinational event and on the extent of the different regions with different phylogenetic histories.

The application of such techniques is especially troublesome at the interface of these levels because phylogenetic relationships are often difficult to estimate. The use of a technique developed to estimate intraspecific cladograms combined with more traditional methods of phylogenetic estimation can improve the estimate in data sets containing a range of diversity when the lower bound of the range approaches 0% divergence. For nucleotide sequence data from the 16S region of the mitochondrial DNA from 72 individuals representing 37 species. this combined-procedures approach improved the estimate of phylogenetic relationships using maximum-parsimony. maximum-likelihood. and neighbor-joining methods.

Cissampelos capensis. Geranium incanum and three Gethyllis species. were subjected to phytochemical screening and testing for cytotoxicity using the brine shrimp lethality bioassay. and antimicrobial activity assays against nine microbes. which included three fungal species. three Gram negative and three Gram positive bacteria.The majority of the extracts tested positive for the presence of tannins. phenolics and flavonoids. while in selected cases. phytochemical tests suggested the presence of essential oils. glycosides or alkaloids. The methanol extract of Gethyllis gregoriana displayed the highest cytotoxicity levels. Generally. the highest levels of biological activity were shown to reside in the methanolic extracts. while hexane extracts revealed very low to zero activity.

Carpobrotus mellei is endemic to the south-Western Cape of South Africa. and also used for various ailments. To date no scientific validation and information has been reported on C. mellei. This study investigated the antimicrobial potential of C. mellei against Staphylococcus aureus. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Candida albicans and Mycobacterium smegmatis. and determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) by two-fold serial dilution. C. mellei showed antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and M. smegmatis in the disc diffusion method. Eight chemical compounds showed clear zones of inhibition in the bioautograms. seven against S. aureus and three compounds were active against M. smegmatis. The ethyl acetate extracts have MIC values of 7.5 mg/ml and 15 mg/ml against S. aureus and M. smegmatis. respectively. Phytochemical tests indicated the presence of flavonoids. hydrolysable tannins. phytosterols and aromatic acids.

The study compares MDR-TB treatment outcomes between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. It involved patients admitted for treatment of MDR-TB between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2006. From 363 patients selected. 268 (177 males and 91 females) had MDR-TB and 95 patients (59 males and 36 females) were co-infected with HIV. Children in the HIV-negative group were 41 and 7 in the HIV-positive group. The HIV-infection was treated with Stavudine. Lamivudine and Efavirenz in 54 patients. Kanamycin. Ethionamide. Ofloxacin. Terizidone. Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol were used for MDR-TB treatment.

South Africa.,2005,Quinton I Joshua and Margaretha D Hofmeyr and Brian T Henen and Frans M Weitz,101,South African journal of science,,,,Climatic and landscape diversity are major determinants of vegetation distribution. structure and composition. 1. 2 Climatic parameters. such as the proportional contribution of winter rainfall. summer aridity. 3 and moisture availability. 4 have been used successfully to differentiate southern African biomes. The fynbos biome is characterized by a high proportion of winter rainfall and a moderate to low summer aridity index. 5 However. regional gradients in climate. physiography and soils are reflected in compositional changes of plant communities. The decline in rainfall from coast to interior is associated with asteraceous and restioid fynbos replacing proteoid and ericaceous elements. while an increasing abundance of grasses from west to east is associated with decreasing summer aridity. 5. 6 The composition of vegetation communities can change seasonally in response to environmental fluctuations. The magnitude of change is more pronounced in communities with a strong annual component. When perennials are present. interand intra-specific competition determines spacing among perennial plants. which in turn influences the abundance of annuals. 7. 8 Prolonged drought. 9 grazing. 10 and other disturbances11 can also change the composition of plant communities; usually perennial shrubs decrease whereas annuals and succulents increase in abundance.

In the plasma membrane.‘cave-like’structures. called caveolae are present. Within these structures. the caveolae associated protein. polymerase-1 and transcript release factor (PTRF). is reported to be involved in the formation of caveolae. Expression of PTRF is lost in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues but it is unclear whether the loss of this gene will promote the progression of prostate cancer. Aim: This study investigates the role of PTRF in normal prostate epithelial cells using siRNA. Methods: Cells were treated with 120 nM of PTRF siRNA and control cells received scrambled siRNA. Seventy 2 h post transfection. PTRF expression was quantified using western analysis. MTT assays were used to measure cell proliferation and transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the presence of caveolae. Cell migration and invasion were also investigated. Results: Treatment with PTRF siRNA significantly reduced PTRF expression and this was accompanied by a reduction in the number of caveolae (p< 0.05). Increased cell proliferation (p< 0.05). migration (p< 0.05) and invasion (p< 0.01) were observed in PTRF siRNA treated cells compared with controls. Furthermore. upregulation of expression of caveolin-1 but not caveolin-2 was observed. Conclusion: These data confirm the role of PTRF in the regulation of caveolae formation. They also suggest that a reduction in PTRF expression and/or the accompanying decrease in caveolae may result in the cells developing a malignant phenotype.,True,O_wkoBAAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Manuel_Lozano_Sanchez/publication/305226923_Dynamic_testing_with_recombinant_human_chorionic_gonadotropin_HCGr_for_challenge_dysfunctional_Leydig_cell_at_male_infertility_with_hypogonadism/links/5785a6c208ae3949cf5390f2/Dynamic-testing-with-recombinant-human-chorionic-gonadotropin-HCGr-for-challenge-dysfunctional-Leydig-cell-at-male-infertility-with-hypogonadism.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Manuel_Lozano_Sanchez/publication/305226923_Dynamic_testing_with_recombinant_human_chorionic_gonadotropin_HCGr_for_challenge_dysfunctional_Leydig_cell_at_male_infertility_with_hypogonadism/links/5785a6c208ae3949cf5390f2/Dynamic-testing-with-recombinant-human-chorionic-gonadotropin-HCGr-for-challenge-dysfunctional-Leydig-cell-at-male-infertility-with-hypogonadism.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we develop DNA primers for a suite of nine sympatric freshwater turtles. and use it to test whether turtle eDNA can be successfully detected in samples from aquaria and an outdoor pond. We also conduct a cost comparison between eDNA detection and detection through traditional survey methods. using data from field surveys at two sites in our target area. We find that eDNA from turtles can be detected using both conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). and that the cost of detection through traditional survey methods is 2–10X higher than eDNA detection for the species in our study range. We summarize necessary future steps for application of eDNA surveys to turtle monitoring and conservation and propose specific cases in which the application of eDNA could further the conservation of threatened turtle species.,True,UDXyuU4AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,108,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130965,16105247423575700031,/scholar?cites=16105247423575700031,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130965,0,0,0

Thus. this discipline also holds great promise for improving the conservation of wildlife. To measure progress towards this promise. we investigated the degree to which movement ecology research is connected to conservation goals as well as the proportion of studies that were incorporated into federal and international status assessments for mobile species at risk. We examined 13.349 “movement ecology” papers published between 1990 and 2014 and found that explicit connections to conservation and management were made in 35% (n = 4. 672) of these papers. with the number of connections increasing over time. We then measured the uptake of movement ecology research into species status assessment and recovery plans (n = 72 documents) produced by three different governance agencies for 12 endangered mobile species. We found that on average 60 % of available movement ecology research was used in the status assessment process. demonstrating that when movement ecology research is available. it is generally being utilized in conservation planning. However. for 25% of these species. there was little movement research available to be used. highlighting that knowledge gaps remain for some at-risk species despite the general growth of movement ecology research.

Rates of nest predation could be influenced through modification of the cues used to find nests. but this requires a clear understanding of how nests are located. Here. we used a buffet-style choice experiment to test the relative role of three cue types (visual. tactile. and chemosensory) on the detection and depredation of Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina (L.. 1758)) nests by a suite of predators dominated by raccoons (Procyon lotor (L.. 1758)). We created sets of artificial nests along an authentic nesting site. presenting single or multiple cues. We interspersed artificial nests with authentic nests and monitored predation rates on both.

The species-specific. case-by-case approaches and small sample sizes inherent to applied conservation measures are not well suited to scientific evaluations of outcomes. Debates about whether a method “works” become entrenched in a vote-counting framework. Furthermore. population-level replication is rare but necessary for disentangling the effects of an intervention from other drivers of population change. Turtle headstarting is a conservation tool that has attracted strong opinions but little robust data.

1100673,Host-parasite relationships of Paramphistomum microbothrium Fischoeder. 1901. in experimentally infested ruminants. with particular reference to sheep,1967,Ivan Gerard Horak,,,,,Pretoria: The Government Printer,The life cycle of Paramphistomum microbothrium Fischoeder. 1901. in experimentally infested sheep. goats and cattle was compared and discussed. It is concluded. that of these domestic ruminants. cattle are the normal definitive hosts of P. microbothrium. The worms in cattle grow larger. migrate more rapidly. lay more eggs. live longer and the percentage take after migration is higher than that in either sheep or goats. Massive infestation of sheep and cattle resulted in retarded growth and migration of the worms. Metacercariae exposed to X-rays were dosed to sheep and the effects on the life cycle studied. The pathological anatomy. clinical pathology and symptoms of acute paramphistomiasis are described in detail and their inter-relationship is discussed. Adult cattle and sheep were successfully immunized by repeated dosage of small numbers of metacercariae (500 to I.500). Adult cattle were readily immunized either with single doses of 40.000 to 176.000 un-irradiated metacercariae or with single or divided doses of 40.000 irradiated metacercariae. Although adult sheep could be immunized. this was only completely successful with a single or divided dose of 40.000 metacercariae. Immunization of adult goats was successful with a single or divided dose of 40.000 metacercariae. The effects of immunity on paramphistomes are a marked reduction in numbers. retarded growth and rate of migration. The intradermal allergic test. a modification of the complement fixation test and the formation of precipitates around live worms incubated in sera from infested hosts were investigated.,True,oFrKXnIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,87,https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/53907,9887477658255694583,/scholar?cites=9887477658255694583,,https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/53907/18horak1967_2.pdf?sequence=5,0,0,0

In humans. segmentation is most obvious at the level of the vertebral column and its associated muscles. and also in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Functionally. segmentation is critical to ensure the movements of a rod‐like structure. such as the vertebral column.

The recent sequencing of its genome has shed new light on the evolution of vertebrate genomes and on the process that govern species diversification. Surprisingly. the patterns of genetic diversity within natural populations of this widespread and abundant North American lizard remain relatively unknown. In the present study. we use 10 novel nuclear DNA sequence loci (N = 62 to 152) and one mitochondrial locus (N = 226) to delimit green anole populations and infer their historical demography. We uncovered four evolutionarily distinct and geographically restricted lineages of green anoles using phylogenetics. Bayesian clustering. and genetic distance methods. Molecular dating indicates that these lineages last shared a common ancestor ∼2 million years ago. Summary statistics and analysis of the frequency distributions of DNA polymorphisms strongly suggest range-wide expansions in population size. Using Bayesian Skyline Plots. we inferred the timing of population size expansions. which differ across lineages. and found evidence for a relatively recent and rapid westward expansion of green anoles across the Gulf Coastal Plain during the mid-Pleistocene. One surprising result is that the distribution of genetic diversity is not consistent with a latitudinal shift caused by climatic oscillations as is observed for many co-distributed taxa. This suggests that the most recent Pleistocene glacial cycles had a limited impact on the geographic distribution of the green anole at the …,True,YpgxmDMAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,48,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038474,9046613658936515019,/scholar?cites=9046613658936515019,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038474,0,0,0

Retrotransposons and DNA transposons are represented by multiple active families. contributing to the very diverse repetitive landscape of the lizard. Surprisingly. ancient transposon copies are relatively rare suggesting that the transposon copy number is tightly controlled in lizard. This bias in favor of young copies results from the joint effect of purifying selection acting on novel insertions and a high rate of DNA loss.

1100737,Lizards and LINEs: Phylogeography and genome evolution of the green anole (Anolis carolinensis),2013,Marc Tollis,,,,,,The sequencing of the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis) genome has already provided insights into how vertebrate genomes have evolved since the phylogenetic split between reptiles and mammals~ 300 million years ago. For instance. the diversity and abundance transposable elements (TEs) in the Anolis genome. particularly the non-LTR retrotransposons (nLTR-LTs). shows more similarity to fish than to mammals. which suggests that mammals have significantly diverged from the amniote ancestor in terms of genome structure. The fate of TEs in a genome relies on the relative strengths of purifying selection against deleterious elements and genetic drift in host populations. Surprisingly. the geographic distribution and demographic history of populations within A. carolinensis has largely escaped scrutiny. We studied the patterns of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences and found that there are five evolutionary lineages of green anoles. which diverged~ 2 million years ago. Climatic shifts during the early Pleistocene may have driven their early diversification. particularly on ancient island refugia in what is now Florida. where a remarkable phylogeographic diversity of green anoles is found. More recently. the dispersal of green anoles onto the continental mainland led to a dramatic westward range expansion across the Gulf Coastal Plain. These insights into the evolutionary history of A. carolinensis allowed us to infer the population dynamics of nLTR-RTs in the Anolis genome.

We suggest a middle-Miocene marine embayment could explain the deposition of reworked marine microfossils and speciation ages and distributions of Gulf endemics. Assessment of the Pleistocene-age mid-peninsular seaway hypothesis reveals that the uplift age of the Baja peninsula and strong genetic discordance of highly dispersive taxa render this hypothesis unlikely. Finally. we document the distribution patterns of 527 plants disjunct between the mainland and Baja California peninsula and suggest postglacial responses that underlie these patterns.

The advent of highly contiguous draft genomes of nonmodel organisms enables study of such gene families through analysis of synteny and sequence identity. Here. we analyze TLR genes from the genomes of 22 tetrapod species. Findings reveal a TLR8 gene expansion in crocodilians and turtles (TLR8B). and a second duplication (TLR8C) specifically within turtles. followed by pseudogenization of that gene in the nonfreshwater species (desert tortoise and green sea turtle).

This can mislead downstream analyses reliant on synteny. such as linkage-based analyses. Recently. the Mojave Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) draft genome was published as a resource to advance conservation efforts for the threatened species and discover more about chelonian biology and evolution. Here. we illustrate steps taken to improve the desert tortoise draft genome by removing contaminating sequences—actions that are typically carried out after the initial release of a draft genome assembly. We used information from NCBI’s Vecscreen output to remove intra-scaffold contamination and trim heading and trailing Ns. We then reordered and renamed scaffolds. and transferred the gene annotation onto this assembly. Finally. we describe the tools developed for this pipeline. freely available on Github (https://github. com/thw17/G_agassizii_reference_update). which facilitate post-assembly processing of other draft genomes.

The “proto-Gulf” scenario based on microfossil evidence outlines a mid-Miocene (ca. 11.6 Ma) marine setting in the present-day northern Gulf. Conversely. geochronological and tectonic evidence supports a “young Gulf”(ca. 6.5 Ma) opening.New evidence reported here from the fossil record of central Baja California. along with results about origination of fish lineages in the northern Gulf may support an older “proto-Gulf” scheme. First. fossil evidence from diatoms and echinoids suggests the base of Angel Mesa near the town of San Ignacio is marine and about 9 Ma. Secondly. in order to supplement existing geological work. a potentially fruitful new line of thought will be presented. based upon the age of origination and range distribution of several living Gulf of California fish species. The evolutionary histories of these fish lineages are inferred from modern DNA sequence data. These results are discussed here because the formation of new marine fish species may be the product of the initial opening of the Gulf and subsequent isolation of the original fish lineages.

We used RNA-Seq to explore the systemic response of Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) gene expression to three levels of Mycoplasma infection to better understand the host response to this bacterial pathogen. We found over an order of magnitude more genes differentially expressed between male and female tortoises (1.037 genes) than differentially expressed among immune groups (40 genes). There were 8 genes differentially expressed among both variables that can be considered sex-biased immune genes in this tortoise. Among experimental immune groups we find enriched GO biological processes for cysteine catabolism. regulation of type 1 interferon production. and regulation of cytokine production involved in immune response. Sex-biased transcription involves iron ion transport. iron ion homeostasis. and regulation of interferon-beta production to be enriched. More detailed work is needed to assess the seasonal response of the candidate genes found here. How seasonal fluctuation of testosterone and corticosterone modulate the immunosuppression of males and their susceptibility to Mycoplasma infection also warrants further investigation. as well as the importance of iron in the immune function and sex-biased differences of this species.

This question. at its heart. is one of causation. Causal structures are used to explain the cause-effect relations within natural systems and can be quantitatively evaluated through structural equation modeling. Here. I suggest that causality provides an organizing framework for linking extrinsic (geological) processes with genetic diversification and species richness that can be broadly applied. By using causal structures within individualistic taxonomic and geographic studies. we can tackle higher-order questions to reveal how Earth shapes life through time. Causal diagrams and structural equation modeling allow the abstraction of variables to accommodate (1) the heterogeneity of individual study systems. and (2) the need to reduce the complexity in interdisciplinary studies. Using directed acyclic graphs to articulate these relationships yield actionable hypotheses that feed directly back into Earth-life theory. I suggest many classically studied features. such as mountain ranges. are aggregate features whose causal effects can be decomposed into networks of indirect causal paths that are empirically testable. Formalizing causal relationships mitigates against the risk of mis-assigning causality. which can cloud our understanding of how the Earth-life system functions. Finally. this approach formalizes a way to test ideas about the top-down causation of biodiversity.

Many factors control habitat distribution and the position of the Pacific and Gulf of California shorelines since the late Miocene. including older volcanic topography and vertical crustal motions driven by rift-related uplift. faulting. and magmatism. Deciphering the spatiotemporal patterns of landscape evolution and evaluating the causes of genetic divergence in central BC hinges on understanding its paleogeography through detailed geologic mapping and sedimentology. At the latitude of San Ignacio-Santa Rosalía. the peninsular topographic divide is a low (~ 400–500 m asl) and broad (15–20 km) pass. This topographic low continues to the SW through San Ignacio as a broad embayment between older constructional Miocene volcanic topography. At the divide we map tuff breccias of the early to middle Miocene Comondú Formation overlain by a sequence of mafic lavas. non-marine conglomerate. and eolian sandstone.

Reconnaissance mapping north of the San Ignacio gap reveals eroded arc stratovolcanic core and medial facies of the well-known Comondú Formation. These Miocene (22-12 Ma) andesitic and dacitic intrusive domes. peléean domes. lavas. block-and-ash-flow deposits and lahars make up the bulk of the 1400 m-high Sierra San Francisco (SSF) that forms the topographic spine of the peninsula. In this part of Baja California Sur. stratovolcano cores host broad erosional. amphitheater valleys. including the Santa Martha valley (7x7 km) within the SSF. 29 km N of San Ignacio. and the El Tajo valley (13x16 km) within the Sierra Santa Lucia. 45 km ESE of San Ignacio. These valleys may be the result of preferential near-vent hydrothermal alteration and erosion.The Comondú Formation in the SSF forms an oblong NNW-elongate and deeply-eroded major volcanic center with gentle radial dips.

However. it is unclear when this behaviour evolved relative to the evolution of viviparity. A preadaptation hypothesis suggests that maternal thermophily was a preadaptation to viviparity. Oviparous squamates are unique among oviparous reptiles for generally retaining their eggs until the embryos achieve one fourth of their development. As a result. maternal thermophily by gravid squamates may provide the same thermoregulatory benefits. at least during early development. that have been associated with viviparity.

Snakes mate in the spring and fall. and females undergo vitellogenesis exclusively in the spring. ovulate in the early summer. and give birth in the late summer. Although parturition occurs at the same time of year in all rattlesnake species studied. females of most species initiate vitellogenesis in the fall. and it is unusual for females to delay this process until the spring. No females gave birth more than once in this study. indicating that reproduction is less than annual. Litter sizes range from 2–7 neonates (mean = 4.5). The sex ratio of the neonates was approximately equal. but male neonates were longer in snout–vent length and heavier than female neonates.

This ability is enabled by a complex digital adhesive mechanism (adhesive toepads) that employs van der Waals based adhesion. augmented by frictional forces. Numerous morphological traits and behaviors have evolved to facilitate deployment of the adhesive mechanism. maximize adhesive force and enable release from the substrate. The complex digital morphologies that result allow geckos to interact with their environment in a novel fashion quite differently from most other lizards. Details of toepad morphology suggest multiple gains and losses of the adhesive mechanism. but lack of a comprehensive phylogeny has hindered efforts to determine how frequently adhesive toepads have been gained and lost. Here we present a multigene phylogeny of geckos. including 107 of 118 recognized genera. and determine that adhesive toepads have been gained and lost multiple times. and remarkably. with approximately equal frequency. The most likely hypothesis suggests that adhesive toepads evolved 11 times and were lost nine times. The overall external morphology of the toepad is strikingly similar in many lineages in which it is independently derived. but lineage-specific differences are evident. particularly regarding internal anatomy. with unique morphological patterns defining each independent derivation.,True,_vVCy3AAAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC,244,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039429,14857617030415291251,/scholar?cites=14857617030415291251,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039429,0,0,0

THE ISLAND remained poorly known. even mysterious. to much of the rest of the world. By the late-Nineteenth Century the geological and biological distinctiveness of the island were becoming evident. but it has not been until recently that the truly unique character of New Caledonia has generally been acknowledged. In addition to its status as a rainforest “hotspot.” and its claim to an endemic family of birds. the most basal flowering plant. and one of the largest and most diverse barrier reef systems in the world. New Caledonia is also home to one of the most highly endemic and species-rich herpetofaunas in the tropical Pacific. This fauna was reviewed by Bavay in 1869 and again by Roux in 1913. When we began our research programs in the region in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Roux’s work was still the most current comprehensive treatment of the reptilian fauna of the island. Our first experiences in New Caledonia made it clear that much remained to be done and that the composition. relationships. distribution. and biology of the herpetofauna remained largely unexplored.

1100806,Familia Gekkonidae (Reptilia. Sauria). Part I: Australia and Oceania,2011,Aaron M Bauer,,,,,Walter de Gruyter,In the years since the previous treatment of the Gekkonidae in Das Tierreich (WERMUTH 1965) many new taxa have been described. and many others resurrected from. or reduced to. synonymy. The net result is an increase of more than two hundred generally recognized species. In addition. the literature. both taxonomic and biological. has continued to proliferate at an ever increasing rate. In order to effectively treat this large group of reptiles the family Gekko nidae has been broken up along geographic lines. with a total of five volumes devoted to the family as a whole. In planned order of completion these volumes cover: Oceania (including Australia and New Guinea); the Americas; Europe. north Africa and palearctic Asia; central and southern Africa and the islands of the Indian Ocean; and tropical Asia. Taxa occurring in more than one region will be treated in each appropraite volume. The present volume includes all of the gecko species occurring in Australia. New Zealand. New Guinea and the islands of Oceania. All islands to the north and west of Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya. as well as the Paciñc islands under Japanese and Philippine control. the Galapagos Islands and the nearshore islands of the Americas are excluded. Australia’s island territories. including those in the Indian Ocean are. however. covered. Whereas all islands groups politically part of Papua New Guinea have been included. the only portions of Indonesia incorporated in this volume are mainland Irian Jaya and its immediately adjacent nearshore islands.

1100807,Global taxonomic diversity of living reptiles,2013,Daniel Pincheira-Donoso and Aaron M Bauer and Shai Meiri and Peter Uetz,8,PloS one,3,e59741,Public Library of Science,Reptiles are one of the most ecologically and evolutionarily remarkable groups of living organisms. having successfully colonized most of the planet. including the oceans and some of the harshest and more environmentally unstable ecosystems on earth. Here. based on a complete dataset of all the world’s diversity of living reptiles. we analyse lineage taxonomic richness both within and among clades. at different levels of the phylogenetic hierarchy. We also analyse the historical tendencies in the descriptions of new reptile species from Linnaeus to March 2012. Although (non-avian) reptiles are the second most species-rich group of amniotes after birds. most of their diversity (96.3%) is concentrated in squamates (59% lizards. 35% snakes. and 2% amphisbaenians). In strong contrast. turtles (3.4%). crocodilians (0.3%). and tuataras (0.01%) are far less diverse. In terms of species discoveries. most turtles and crocodilians were described early. while descriptions of lizards. snakes and amphisbaenians are multimodal with respect to time. Lizard descriptions. in particular. have reached unprecedented levels during the last decade. Finally. despite such remarkably asymmetric distributions of reptile taxonomic diversity among groups. we found that the distributions of lineage richness are consistently right-skewed. with most clades (monophyletic families and genera) containing few lineages (monophyletic genera and species. respectively). while only a few have radiated greatly (notably the families Colubridae and Scincidae. and the lizard genera Anolis and Liolaemus).

Reconsideration of the types of this taxon reveals another interpretation that maintains nomenclatural stability for both taxa. A lectotype is selected for Lacerta punctata that fixes this name to the Asian species currently known as Lygosoma punctatum. The first type designation for Euprepis is invalid and the oldest valid designation places Euprepis in the synonymy of Mabuya sensu stricto.

Nocturnality is presumed to have evolved early in gecko evolution and geckos possess numerous adaptations to functioning in low light and at low temperatures. However. not all gecko species are nocturnal and most diurnal geckos have their own distinct adaptations to living in warmer. sunlit environments. We reconstructed the evolution of gecko activity patterns using a newly generated time-calibrated phylogeny. Our results provide the first phylogenetic analysis of temporal activity patterns in geckos and confirm an ancient origin of nocturnality at the root of the gecko tree. We identify multiple transitions to diurnality at a variety of evolutionary time scales and transitions back to nocturnality occur in several predominantly diurnal clades.

The proposal to split the genus does not conform to the recently proposed guidelines for publishing new genera. Concise amended characterizations are provided for the monophyletic family Amanitaceae and its two monophyletic genera Amanita and Limacella. 2 The characterization of Amanita rests on a single. unique synapomorphy—schizohymenial ontogeny in its agaricoid and secotioid taxa. We propose a minimal reorganization of Amanita—removal of stirps Hesleri from subsection Vittadiniae. Some open issues in Amanita systematics are discussed. Amanita is an emblematic genus and the focus of diverse research programs. Taxonomists and users of taxonomic and systematic products are used to. and rely on. Amanita as a genus with meaningful. morphologically defined subdivisions. easy to teach and easy to use.

More precisely. the Korean Peninsula offers a unique model to assess patterns and processes of speciation as it hosts the northern-and eastern-most distribution limit of some widespread Asian taxa. Despite this. studies addressing phylogeographic patterns and population genetics in the peninsula and surrounding countries are few and studies for most families are lacking.

Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are highly polymorphic. and play a key role in the adaptive immune response against pathogens. MHC polymorphism has been linked to balancing selection or heterogeneous selection promoting local adaptation. However. spatial patterns of MHC polymorphism are also influenced by gene flow and drift. Wolverines are highly vagile. inhabiting varied ecoregions that include boreal forest. taiga. tundra. and high alpine ecosystems. Here. we investigated the immunogenetic variation of wolverines in Canada as a surrogate for identifying local adaptation by contrasting the genetic structure at MHC relative to the structure at 11 neutral microsatellites to account for gene flow and drift. Evidence of historical positive selection was detected at MHC using maximum likelihood codon-based methods. Bayesian and multivariate cluster analyses revealed weaker population genetic differentiation at MHC relative to the increasing microsatellite genetic structure towards the eastern wolverine distribution. Mantel correlations of MHC against geographical distances showed no pattern of isolation by distance (IBD: r = -0.03. p = 0.9). whereas for microsatellites we found a relatively strong and significant IBD (r = 0.54. p = 0.01).

We used genotypes at 11 microsatellite loci to reveal the genetic structure of. and directional gene flow among. populations to predict the likely future spread of the pathogen in the northwest and to estimate effective population size (Ne). We also pyrosequenced the DRB1-like exon 2 of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in 160 individuals to explore immunogenetic selection by WNS.

Reliable evaluations of genetic structure require sound sampling schemes because inappropriate sampling may over- and under-estimate spatial patterns of genetic structure. Sampling bias has been investigated through computer simulations mostly for animal species with continuous distributions. For tree species that have different life history traits. results from such studies may not apply. Here. I used spatially explicit landscape genetic simulations to assess the effects of spatial sampling scheme (random. systematic. and cluster). sampling intensity (35. 50. 65. and 80%). and the number of microsatellite loci (8. 14. and 20) on inferences of genetic structure under isolation by distance (IBD) in two forest tree species with varying dispersal distances and patchy distributions.

By determining which gene variants are favored in local interactions among populations with and without disease. spatially explicit adaptive responses to pathogens can be elucidated. Much of our current understanding of host responses to disease comes from a small number of genes associated with an immune response. High‐throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies. such as genotype‐by‐sequencing (GBS). facilitate expanded explorations of genomic variation among populations.

Challenges to the recovery of this species include an incomplete understanding of the threats most responsible for its decline. insufficient information on the effectiveness of management actions. and the intractability of threats across a large geographical range and multiple jurisdictions. Recognition that these challenges require long-term conservation efforts to ensure the species' persistence—with or without the protections of the ESA—necessitates a more structured approach to recovery. including broad stakeholder participation.

Simulations showed that Program CAPTURE's Jackknife and Darroch estimators are robust to variations in capturability. which confound most commonly used estimators (e.g.. Lincoln-Petersen). Mean capturability determines which estimator is most appropriate for a given population. These methods were applied to data from several tortoise populations.

Averill-Murray and Catherine R Darst and Nathan Strout and Martin Wong,8,Herpetological Conservation and Biology,1,1-15,,Conservation of Mojave Desert Tortoises is founded on a set of tortoise conservation areas (TCAs) established across the range of the species. Limitations of the existing reserve design and increasing development pressures on the intervening habitat matrix underscore the need to conserve linkages between existing TCAs. We modeled linkages between TCAs using least-cost corridors based on an underlying model of suitable tortoise habitat. Results indicate that TCAs contain 55% of total historic habitat (45.340 km2). A minimum linkage network would contain 16.282 km2 of habitat (20% historic). This combined area of 61.622 km2 represents an initial framework to develop a conservation network for the species. taking into account large areas of existing high-intensity human uses such as military operations and off-highway-vehicle recreation. Models that assume more permeable habitat to tortoise connectivity reveal much broader linkages. but approximately 700 km2 of habitat within the minimum linkages are already at risk of permanent habitat loss through solar energy development. Additional conservation of occupied habitat adjacent to the minimum linkages and existing TCAs would provide security against edge effects and population declines within conservation areas. especially given limitations in existing reserve architecture. Application of these linkage models will require refinement at the local level. and questions remain about the ultimate ability of a conservation network based on these models to support viable tortoise populations and accommodate climate change.

Cochise County.Western Hog-nosed Snakes are generally active during mornings and evenings. retreating to belowground shelter at night and during mid-day. When seeking shelter. the snake uses its specialized rostral scale as a spade to dig into loose sandy or loamy soil.

They also use small rodent burrows. but hog-nosed snakes rarely take cover below logs. boards. or other surface objects (Werler and Dixon 2000). The hognosed snake’s digging adaptation and behavior also facilitate foraging for amphibians (mostly toads and frogs). reptiles. and the occasional mammal or bird.

A drop in PCE from ∼15% to ∼5% was observed when the concentration of LMWFs of the PM6 polymer was increased from 1% to 52%. The drop in PCEs is found to be due to the lowering of the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill …,True,1GDoIakAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC,10,https://pubs.rsc.org/no/content/articlehtml/2020/ee/d0ee01896a,16670746290699482128,/scholar?cites=16670746290699482128,,,0,0,0

Ltd.,The scalar coupled proton NMR spectra of many organic molecules possessing more than one phenyl ring are generally complex due to degeneracy of transitions arising from the closely resonating protons. in addition to several short‐ and long‐range couplings experienced by each proton. Analogous situations are generally encountered in derivatives of halogenated benzanilides. Extraction of information from such spectra is challenging and demands the differentiation of spectrum pertaining to each phenyl ring and the simplification of their spectral complexity. The present study employs the blend of independent spin system filtering and the spin‐state selective detection of single quantum (SQ) transitions by the two‐dimensional multiple quantum (MQ) methodology in achieving this goal.

However. the analysis of targeted APIs in intact tablet formulations is less straightforward due to the coexistence of excipients as major components and different APIs at dilute concentrations (often below 10​ wt% loading). Although solid-state (ss) NMR spectroscopy is widely used to investigate short-range order. polymorphism. and pseudo-polymorphism in neat pharmaceutical compounds. the analysis of complex drug formulations is often limited by overlapped signals that originate from structurally different APIs and excipients.

It was found that the electrical response to chemical vapours adsorbed on the various nanoparticle films varied markedly and was determined by the surface functional groups. Ellipsometric studies revealed that the film thickness increased during exposure to the chemical vapours. These thickness changes of the films correlate with the changes in electrical conductivity. Two physical effects are believed to play a role in determining these conductivity changes. Under high partial pressure. the change in nanoparticle core-core separation is the main contribution to the change in conductivity and generally leads to a reduction in the conductivity.

We determined the extinction coefficients at both high photon energy (3.1 eV) and at the first excitonic transition band for CIS-QDs. ranging in size from 2.5 nm to 5.1 nm. Both coefficient trends displayed a power-law size dependence for the QDs. These data allow the in situ assessment of the CIS-QD concentration via routine optical absorption measurements. which is an important parameter for many applications. The formation of ZnS on the surface of CIS-QDs dramatically increases the photoluminescence quantum yield. while also blue-shifting the photoluminescent emission.

UV(B)-photolysis of the cured films gave rise to IR bands in the carbonyl region at ca 1706 cm-1 and a UV band at 310 nm attributed to formation of a quinone methide. an assignment supported by the development of new IR bands at 1595. 1650. and 1695 cm-1 which are typical of this chromophore. In addition. intensification of a band at 1171 cm-1 is attributed to cross-linking of the soft segments in the polymer.Plots of the growth of the 1706 cm-1 band on irradiation over time showed the usual profile for conversion of CH2 groups to carbonyl: these were normalised against the band at 2900 cm-1 of the polymer to give the carbonyl index (CI).

The success of radical mediated transformations in synthesis has in part been due to the neutral nature of the reactions. which allow a wide degree of functionality to be tolerated in substrates. The majority of published work has focused upon the reactions of carbon centered radicals1. with the reactions of nitrogen substituted radicals receiving much less attention2. Cyclisation of aminyl radicals is often problematic due to their potential reversibility and in addition the nucleophilic nature of the radical often facilitates competitive trapping of the initial radical by tributylstannane. These problems can be overcome by using amidyl radicals instead of nucleophilic aminyl radicals. Recently. two new procedures for the generation of amidyl radicals have been reported. The use of N-acyl sulpheneamides as radical precursors has been reported by Newcomb3. while the use of O-benzoyl hydroxamic acid derivatives has been explored by Zard4.

The X-ray structure showed that 16 units of G 2 and 4 equiv of alkali picrate form the lipophilic G-quadruplex. The quadruplex has a filled cation channel. with three K+ ions and one Cs+ ion located along its central axis. The quadruplex is formed by a pair of head-to-tail (G 2)8-K+ octamers. Both octamers use eight carbonyl oxygens to coordinate K+. The two (G 2)8-K+ octamers are of opposite polarity. being coaxially stacked in a head-to-head orientation. A Cs+ cation. with an unusual coordination geometry. caps the cation channel. The Cs+ is coordinated to four acetonitrile solvent molecules in an η2-fashion.

The use of PFG-NMR to measure diffusion coefficients for the different aggregates allowed us to observe the influences of cation. solvent and anion on the self-assembly process. Three case studies are presented. In the first study. diffusion NMR confirmed formation of a hexadecameric G-quadruplex [G1] 16· 4K+· 4 picÀ in CD3CN. Furthermore. hexadecamer formation from 5’-TBDMS-2’. 3’-isopropylidene G1 and K+ picrate was shown to be a cooperative process in CD3CN. In the second study. diffusion NMR studies on 5’-(3. 5-bis (methoxy) benzoyl)-2’. 3’-isopropylidene G4 showed that hierarchical self-association of G8-octamers is controlled by the K+ cation. Evidence for formation of both discrete G8-octamers and G16-hexadecamers in CD2Cl2 was obtained. The position of this octamer–hexadecamer equilibrium was shown to depend on the K+ concentration. In the third case. diffusionNMR was used to determine the size of a guanosine self-assembly where NMR signal integration was ambiguous.

From earlier information. including the use of site-directed irreversible inhibitors. several of the amino acids likely to form part of the active auxin-binding site were provisionally assigned. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of the auxin-binding protein showed a short region containing all but one of these amino acids. We find that antisera raised against a synthetic peptide encompassing this region recognize all isoforms of the maize auxin-binding protein together with homologous polypeptides in other species. We further find that the antibodies hyperpolarize protoplast transmembrane potential in an auxin-like manner.

Auxin action and auxin-binding proteins,1995,Richard M Napier and Michael A Venis,,,,167-201,Cambridge University Press,The plant growth regulator auxin mediates an enormous range of developmental and growth responses. some of which are manifest rapidly and others manifest only after considerable lag periods. The protein that perceives auxin. the auxin receptor. has been sought by many laboratories and the search has identified a good number of candidates. However. a receptor must not only bind auxin. but also transduce the auxin stimulus into the responses we recognize. Finding evidence for this second condition has always proved very demanding. A key requisite is a convenient assay for auxin activity and preferably one involving a rapid response because this is likely to be linked directly to the perception event. For one auxin-binding protein (ABP1) there is growing evidence that it is a functional auxin receptor. The assays used in this work have been rapid auxin-induced changes in protoplast electrophysiology There …,True,2C1Tx8EAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,115,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2558693,74175559928788244,/scholar?cites=74175559928788244,,,0,0,0

Implicitly or explicitly. interest in such proteins resides in their possible role as auxin receptors. Many of these proteins are characterized as ABPs solely by their susceptibility to covalent photolabeling by tritiated azido-indole-3-acetic acid. In most cases where the labeled polypeptides have been identified. they turn out to have roles unconnected with primary auxin perception. It seems likely that auxin is binding to sites of catholic specificity in these cases and the influence of experimental protocols on the data is discussed. Because the term ABP implies that auxin binding affects the function of that protein. the importance of establishing further criteria before photolabeled peptides can be termed ABPs is emphasized.

The swelling response to the natural auxin IAA showed a biphasic dose response curve but that to the synthetic auxin 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) showed a simple bell-shaped dose response curve. The responses to IAA and NAA were further analyzed using antibodies raised against ABP1 (auxin-binding protein 1). and their dependency on extracellular ions was investigated.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,This article describes the synthesis and characterization of a variety of new poly(2‐oxazoline)s. With regard to functional polymers. 2‐oxazolines represent an interesting class of monomers because of the easy variation of the substituent in 2‐position. Starting from the corresponding nitriles. different 2‐oxazolines were obtained containing a diverse set of 2‐substituents. including thioether bonds (M11). trifluoromethyl groups (M8. M10). and alkyl‐ or aryl groups (M1–M7). The subsequent polymerization of the majority of these monomers proceeded in a living manner. which was demonstrated by linear first‐order kinetics. a linear increase of molar mass with conversion. and relatively narrow molar mass distributions. In addition. selected thermal and surface properties of the polymers were studied utilizing DSC and contact‐angle measurements to determine the effects of different 2‐substituents on the macroscopic …,True,AXESPJwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,66,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pola.23448,12561955491327561590,/scholar?cites=12561955491327561590,,,0,0,0

1101129,Foldamers: a manifesto,1998,Samuel H Gellman,31,,4,173-180,American Chemical Society,Nature relies on large molecules to carry out sophisticated chemical operations. such as catalysis. tight and specific binding. directed flow of electrons. or controlled crystallization of inorganic phases. The polymers entrusted with these crucial tasks. mostly proteins but sometimes RNA. are unique relative to other biological and synthetic polymers in that they adopt specific compact conformations that are thermodynamically and kinetically stable. These folding patterns generate “active sites” via precise three-dimensional arrangement of functional groups. In terms of covalent connectivity. the groups that comprise the active site are often widely spaced along the polymer backbone.The remarkable range of chemical capabilities that evolution has elicited from proteins suggests that it might be possible to design analogous capabilities into unnatural polymers that fold into compact and specific conformations. Since biological evolution has operated under many constraints. the functional properties of proteins and RNA should be viewed as merely exemplifying the potential of compactly folded polymers. The chemist’s domain includes all possible combinations of the elements. and the biological realm. vast and complex though it may be. is only a small part of that domain. Therefore. realization of the potential of folding polymers may be limited more by the human imagination than by physical barriers. I use the term “foldamer” to describe any polymer with a strong tendency to adopt a specific compact conformation.

We postulate that thedesired folding behavior will be most likely if intramolecular hydrogen bonds are unfavorable between nearest neighbor amide groups on the polymer backbone. Previous work from other laboratories and our own has shown that this criterion applies to-amino acid polymers.

1101145,Rules for Antiparallel β-Sheet Design:  d-Pro-Gly Is Superior to l-Asn-Gly for β-Hairpin Nucleation1,1998,Heather E Stanger and Samuel H Gellman,120,Journal of the American Chemical Society,17,4236-4237,American Chemical Society,Folded proteins display considerable conformational diversity at the tertiary structural level. but only a few secondary structures with long-range order are observed: helices (R and 310) and sheets (parallel and antiparallel). 2a Understanding the origins of helix and sheet conformational stability is therefore a prerequisite for understanding the origins of protein folding preferences. The R-helix has been extensively examined with model systems. because there are well-established rules for designing peptides that adopt helical conformations in solution. 2b These model systems allow one to determine the effects of sequence. length. side chain-side chain interactions. solvent. and other variables on helix stability in the absence of a tertiary context. Relationships between β-sheet stability and sequence. length. or other factors are much less well-documented. because it has been difficult to generate peptides that adopt β-sheet conformations without aggregating in aqueous solution. 3. 4 This difficulty has also hindered de novo design of β-sheet-rich protein tertiary structures. 5The prospects for rational design of small. soluble β-sheet increments have been advanced by the identification of several short. linear peptides (e16 residues) that display partial β-hairpin formation in aqueous solution. 6 A β-hairpin contains two antiparallel strands and a short connecting loop. and it must be possible to specify the location and size of the loop if β-hairpins are to be useful model systems for exploring antiparallel β-sheet stability.

Recent work from Hamuro et al. has shown that oligomers of β-amino acids (“β-peptides”) that can adopt an amphiphilic helix defined by 14-membered ring hydrogen bonds (“14-helix”) are active against Escherichia coli [Hamuro.

We have created two series of cationic 9- and 10-residue amphiphilic β-peptides to probe the effect of 14-helix stability on antimicrobial and hemolytic activity. 14-Helix stability within these series is modulated by varying the proportions of rigid trans-2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) residues and flexible acyclic residues.

Conformational instability arises because the forces that promote folding. like hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. are insufficient to overcome the entropic cost of ordering the oligo-R-amino acid backbone. β-Amino acid oligomers (“β-peptides”) provide an interesting alternative to conventional peptides for design purposes. since the β-peptide backbone offers greater opportunity for conformational rigidification. 1 Short β-peptides have recently been shown to adopt each of the three types of regular secondary structure (helix. sheet. and turn) that are observed in proteins. 2-4 but these results have been obtained in organic solvents.

MA) has been studied using 1-phenylethyl dithiobenzoate (1-PEDB) and 2-(2-cyanopropyl) dithiobenzoate (CPDB) as RAFT agents at 60 °C. Rate retardation with increasing initial RAFT agent concentrations is common to both 1-PEDB- and CPDB-mediated MA polymerizations and occurs in comparable magnitude. A pronounced inhibition period is observed in 1-PEDB-mediated MA polymerizations. whereas the corresponding CPDB-mediated polymerizations show considerably less inhibition. The cause for this inhibition may either be associated with the leaving group of the initial RAFT agent or with the slow fragmentation of the initial intermediate macroRAFT radical. The present experimental data suggest that slow fragmentation is the probable cause for inhibition.

J-Coupling analysis of the 1D and 2D 1H and 13C spectra was used to determine the conformation of the ring systems in the molecule. It appeared that at low temperature (283 K) the deoxyribose sugars adopt a N-type conformation. The geometry is best described by an intermediate between the 3 (2) T and 3E forms. In addition. we were able to derive all other torsion angles in the phosphate backbone ring system. ie. alpha+. beta t. gamma+. delta (= 89 degrees). epsilon t. and zeta+.

UV-melting experiments indicate that two molecules can form a dimer in which the adenine bases are intercalated. The feasibility of this structure is indicated by molecular mechanics calculations.

This is demonstrated in this paper by synthesis and characterisation of a cholestrol based initiator and macroinitiators based on mono and difunctional polymers of ethylene and butylene. Polymerization of styrene and methacrylates using Schiff base ligands in conjunction with Cu (I) Br proceeds in a controlled manner yielding homopolymers.

This has been achieved via two new synthetic processes. Firstly. a PIB macroinitiator was synthesised from PIB that is primarily terminated by an α-olefin. hydroboration/oxidation of the terminal α-olefin followed by esterification with α-bromoisobutyryl bromide furnished the desired macroinitiator. The PIB macroinitiator was then utilised to polymerise DMAEMA by SET-LRP at different block lengths of PDMAEMA. However. end fidelity of the PIB macroinitiator was low (60%) and as such synthesising a block of PDMAEMA with a predictable degree of polymerisation was not possible.

The Cnr mutation results in colorless fruits with a substantial loss of cell-to-cell adhesion. The nature of the mutation and the identity of the Cnr gene were previously unknown. Using positional cloning and virus-induced gene silencing. here we demonstrate that an SBP-box (SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein–like) gene resides at the Cnr locus. Furthermore. the Cnr phenotype results from a spontaneous epigenetic change in the SBP-box promoter. The discovery that Cnr is an epimutation was unexpected. as very few spontaneous epimutations have been described in plants 3. 4.

This type of intron mobility is referred to as ‘intron homing’. and depends on restriction endonucleases (ENases) encoded by the mobile introns. The ENase cleaves the intron-minus allele near the site of intron insertion. thereby initiating gene conversion.

The main aim of the current review is to identify ways of meeting this objective. After reviewing current irrigation practices. discussion is centred on the sensitivity of crops to water deficit. the finding that growth of many crops is unaffected by considerable lowering of soil water content and. on this basis. the creation of improved means of irrigation scheduling. Subsequently. attention is focused on irrigation problems associated with spatial variability in soil water and the often slow infiltration of water into soil. especially the subsoil. As monitoring of soil water is important for estimating irrigation requirements. the attributes of the two main types of soil water sensors and their most appropriate uses are described.

Leaf area was reduced and root:shoot ratio increased in response to increasing salinity in the absence of changes in leaf turgor for both genotypes. Stomatal conductance was however reduced suggesting that a non-hydraulic factor may be coordinating responses to the salinity in the rooting medium.

Low polymorphism at the DNA level conflicts with the wealth of morphological variation. Fruits vary widely in size. shape and colour. In contrast. genetic variation between the 16 wild relatives is tremendous. Several large seed banks provide tomato germplasm for both domesticated and wild accessions of tomato. Recently. the genomes of the inbred cultivar “Heinz 1706” (≈900 Mb) and S. pimpinellifolium (739 Mb) were sequenced. Genomic markers and genome re-sequencing data are available for >150 cultivars and accessions. Transformation of tomato is relatively easy and T-DNA insertion line collections are available. Tomato is widely used as a model crop for fruit development but also for diverse physiological. cellular. biochemical. molecular and genetic studies. It can be easily grown in greenhouses or growth chambers. Plants grow. flower. and develop fruits well at daily light lengths between 8-16 hours. The required daily light integral of an experiment depends on growth stage and temperature investigated. Temperature must be 10-35°C. relative humidity 30-90 % and CO2 concentration 200-1500 µmol mol-1. Temperature determines the speed of the phenological development while daily light integral and CO2 concentration affect photosynthesis and biomass production.

It allows rapid acquisition of novel functions by transmission of adaptive genes between related species. However. the frequency of homologous recombination between bacterial species decreases sharply with the extent of DNA sequence divergence between the donor and the recipient. In Bacillus andEscherichia. this sexual isolation has been shown to be an exponential function of sequence divergence. Here we demonstrate that sexual isolation in transformation between Streptococcus pneumoniae recipient strains and donor DNA from related strains and species follows the described exponential relationship. We show that the Hex mismatch repair system poses a significant barrier to recombination over the entire range of sequence divergence (0.6 to 27%) investigated. Although mismatch repair becomes partially saturated. it …,True,MMn5etwAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,218,https://jb.asm.org/content/182/4/1016.short,12612322694741778501,/scholar?cites=12612322694741778501,,https://jb.asm.org/content/jb/182/4/1016.full.pdf,0,0,0

S. suis infections occur sporadically in human Europe and North America. but a recent major outbreak has been described in China with high levels of mortality. The mechanisms of S. suis pathogenesis in humans and pigs are poorly understood.  Methodology/Principal Findings The sequencing of whole genomes of S. suis isolates provides opportunities to investigate the genetic basis of infection. Here we describe whole genome sequences of three S. suis strains from the same lineage: one from European pigs. and two from human cases from China and Vietnam. Comparative genomic analysis was used to investigate the variability of these strains. S. suis is phylogenetically distinct from other Streptococcus species for which genome sequences are currently available. Accordingly. ∼40% of the ∼2 Mb genome is unique in comparison to other Streptococcus species. Finer genomic comparisons within the species showed a high level of sequence conservation; virtually all of the genome is common to the S. suis strains. The only exceptions are three ∼90 kb regions. present in the two isolates from humans. composed of integrative conjugative elements and transposons. Carried in these regions are coding sequences associated with drug resistance. In addition. small-scale sequence variation has generated pseudogenes in putative virulence and colonization factors.

The populations of veterinary and human isolates overlap. suggesting that most veterinary sources should be considered reservoirs of pathogenic campylobacters. There were some associations between source and sequence type complex. indicating that host or source adaptation may exist. The pig isolates formed a distinct group by MLST and may well represent a potential pig-adapted clone of C. jejuni.

As both strains expressed the serotype 23F capsule. were very closely related in overall genotype. and possessed identical or closely related mosaic pbp1a. pbp2x. and pbp2b genes. it is likely that they have arisen from a recent common ancestor.

The ethoxy groups of the poly(diethoxysiloxane) were removed via a triethylamine-catalyzed interfacial hydrolysis and sol−gel reaction. The organic components were removed via a calcination step. The two-stage templating route provided siliceous microcapsules of which the capsule walls were decorated on either the outside or inside with nanocapsules composed of Laponite clay. ,True,dN7j8g8AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,113,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la7016769,5479091775251887245,/scholar?cites=5479091775251887245,,,0,0,0

Joan Mott Prize Lecture,2020,Gareth W Price and Joe A Potter and Bethany M Williams and Chelsy L Cliff and Paul E Squires and Claire E Hills,105,,2,219-229,,The ability of cells to communicate and synchronise their activity is essential for the maintenance of tissue structure. integrity and function. A family of membrane‐bound proteins called connexins are largely responsible for mediating the local transfer of information between cells. Assembled in the cell membrane as a hexameric connexon. they either function as a conduit for paracrine signalling. forming a transmembrane hemi‐channel. or. if aligned with connexons on neighbouring cells. form a continuous aqueous pore or gap junction. which allows for the direct transmission of metabolic and electrical signals. Regulation of connexin synthesis and activity is critical to cellular function. and a number of diseases are attributed to changes in the expression and/or function of these important proteins. A link between hyperglycaemia. connexin expression. altered nucleotide concentrations and impaired function highlights …,True,MfPzu5kAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC,2,https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/EP087770,14293448657372781008,/scholar?cites=14293448657372781008,,https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1113/EP087770,0,0,0

New York. NY,Cell-to-cell communication is an essential process for the efficient function of cells and tissues. Central to this is the purinergic transmission of purines. with ligands such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Altered cell-to-cell communication. and in particular changes in the paracrine release of extracellular ATP. plays crucial roles in pathophysiological conditions. such as diabetes. ATP biosensing provides a reliable. real-time measurement of local extracellular ATP concentrations. This allows the detection of altered ATP release. which underlies the progression of inflammation and fibrosis and is a potential therapeutic target. Here we describe in a step-by-step basis how to utilize sensitive microelectrode biosensors to detect low. real-time concentrations of ATP. in vitro.,True,MfPzu5kAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC,0,https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/7651_2020_297,,,,,0,0,0
