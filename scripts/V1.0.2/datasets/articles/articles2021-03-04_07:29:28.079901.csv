1118358,Polyhydroxylated alkaloids—natural occurrence and therapeutic applications,2001,Alison A Watson and George WJ Fleet and Naoki Asano and Russell J Molyneux and Robert J Nash,56,,3,265-295,Pergamon,Over one hundred polyhydroxylated alkaloids have been isolated from plants and micro-organisms. These alkaloids can be potent and highly selective glycosidase inhibitors and are arousing great interest as tools to study cellular recognition and as potential therapeutic agents.

However it is not clear whether the placebo response is reproducible within individuals and what role personality traits might play in predicting it. We induced placebo analgesia by conditioning subjects to expect pain reduction following a sham-treatment in the guise of a local anaesthetic cream applied to one arm.

In this study we aimed to identify the brain structures activated during placebo conditioning and subsequent placebo analgesia. We induced placebo analgesia by associating a sham treatment with pain reduction and used fMRI to measure brain activity associated with three stages of the placebo response: before. during and after the sham treatment. while participants anticipated and experienced brief laser pain. In the control session participants were explicitly told that the treatment was inactive. The sham treatment group reported a significant reduction in pain rating (p = 0.012).

Behavioral. psychophysiological. and neuroimaging results have largely contributed to accepting the placebo response as real. A major aspect of recent and future advances in placebo research is to demonstrate linkages between behavior. brain. and bodily responses.

We stimulated both forearms and recorded laser-evoked potentials from 18 healthy volunteers treated on one arm with a sham analgesic cream and an inactive cream on the other (treatment group). and 13 volunteers with an inactive cream on both arms (controls).

Various chromatographic methods have replaced the classical fractional crystallization. seeding and enzymatic procedures. Of these. t.l.c. provides a direct. simple. and inexpensive method for resolution of enantiomers of amino acids and their derivatives. Ligand exchange. ion exchange. and molecular inclusion complexation have been the basis of t.l.c. resolution of enantiomers of amino acids and their derivatives.

Dichloro-s-triazines (DCTs) were used as CDRs for derivatization of α-amino acids under basic conditions at room temperature (30 °C) while derivatization with monochloro-s-traizine (MCT) reagents was carried out at 80 °C. The resultant diastereomers were separated on a reversed-phase C18 column using mixtures of acetonitrile and aqueous-trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The separation results for the two were compared. One DCT reagent was optimized for derivatization kinetics with respect to the effects of pH. reagent excess. temperature and reaction time on derivatization yield. In most of the cases. DCT reagents provided better separation of diastereomers in comparison to MCT reagents.

N.N-dimethyl-l-phenylalanine (N.N-Me2-l-Phe). and l-tryptophan (l-Trp) on commercial precoated normal phase plates.

1118405,Resolution of enantiomers with achiral phase chromatography,1992,J Martens and R Bhushan,15,Journal of Liquid Chromatography & Related Technologies,1,1-27,Taylor & Francis Group,Resolution of enantiomers is of widely accepted importance. Since there have been sporadic reports on liquid chromatographic resolution of enantiomers using achiral stationary phase in conjunction with a mobile phase having no external chiral compound the present paper focuses on such achiral phase resolutions of enantiomers along with their possible explanations. At the same time it introduces to the present day practice of resolution of enantiomers by liquid chromatography which makes use of a chiral selector either bound to the stationary phase or added to the mobile phase. The mechanisms for chiral phase chromatographic methods are also discussed.,True,-fE0yDwAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,40,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10826079208018806,10623827306089660745,/scholar?cites=10623827306089660745,,,0,0,0
