Beyond the tumor margin at the tumor microenvironment (TME). there is an orchestra of immune cells and soluble mediators known as the cellular and non-cellular components of TME that shape the tumor architecture. Several reports have focused on immune cells influencing the cellular components of the TME. therefore the main focus of our chapter will be the noncellular components of TME. The non-cellular components of TME include cytokines. chemokines. growth factors. inflammatory and extra-cellular matrix remodeling enzymes that are released by the tumor cells or associated immune cells in the TME. These soluble mediators outline the progression of the disease by mediating the communication taking place between the tumor cell itself and its surrounding. Considering that TME is a critical determinant in unraveling the complexity of cancer cells. thus. zooming in at the TME would definitely help us pave the road for new combinatory immuno-oncological interventions incorporating the TME in their mechanism of action and thus lowering the chances of relapse rates among cancer patients.,True,ZfynoIMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=scDvDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA18&dq=info:jl1d5a7pmKoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=rl5Ep-Vrv4&sig=o8fbZZWm9da5H2ayB-J62XsgMok,,,,,0,0,0

This paper presents the results of an experimental spinach (Spinacia oleracea) drying study in a new solar dryer. It is an indirect solar dryer with forced convection was developed and improved at the Food Science laboratory. Drying spinach leaves to a final moisture content of 2% from 93.2%(wet basis). with an air-drying speed equal to 1m/s. This study made it possible to determine the drying kinetics of spinach leaves. the evolution of the temperature profile and the influence of drying air recycling (0. 50 and 90%) on drying time. The curves of drying obtained show that the drying rate increased marginally with the increase in fraction of air recycled. It is reduced 3 to 4 hours. by increasing the fraction air recycled from 50 to 90% respectively. with a significant profit of thermal energy. The drying temperature is higher and stable in the drying chamber of the order of 55 to 65 C (90% air recycled).,True,wLRXtTcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12581356789259177442&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

These wetlands consist of a c. 35 km2 area of mangroves and tidal mudflats which were designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA) within the West Malagasy Wetlands Endemic Bird Area (EBA) in 2001. However. recent and detailed information on their avifauna remains lacking. We used a boat to survey three 4 km stretches of the IBA’s river system on four repeated occasions each year. supplemented by opportunistic observations made in various parts of the study area. In total. we detected 59 species in Ankobohobo Wetland through c. 608 h of observation effort. This includes 26 Malagasy endemics. two Near Threatened species. three Endangered species (Malagasy Sacred Ibis Threskiornis bernieri. Malagasy Pond Heron Ardeola idae. and Humblot’s Heron Ardea humbloti). and the Critically Endangered Madagascan Fish Eagle Haliaeetus vociferoides. These constitute substantial additions to the inventory of the established Ankobohobo Wetland IBA. which previously stood at 19 species including one Malagasy endemic. We summarise these records here. providing additional details for threatened species. We also report observed threats to the wetlands. particularly with regards to the breeding H. vociferoides population. and highlight Ankobohobo as an important conservation priority.,True,cSESWyoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/scopus/article/view/198313,,,,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/scopus/article/download/198313/187003,0,0,0

The first predation event was recorded in a storage cabin at a field station in Sainte Luce (-24.780976; 47.171012; 15 m asl) on 5 June 2017. At 16h54. an adult M. meridionalis (approx. 650 mm TL.~ 90 g weight) was seen consuming an adult rat (approx. 320 mm body length. estimated 100–110 g weight). Total ingestion from the point of discovery (Fig. 2A) took 21 minutes and seemed to take considerable effort with this relatively large prey item. approximately 115–125% the mass of the snake. The second observation took place within a protected littoral forest fragment (-24.773984; 47.173716; 18 m asl) at approximately 17: 00 h on 15 November 2017. An adult M. meridionalis (approx. 750 mm TL.~ 100 g weight) was observed on a sandy forest path consuming an adult male R. rattus (approx. 350 mm body length. estimated 130 g weight) for roughly 30 minutes until all but the tail remained visible (Fig. 2B). We estimated that this adult rat made up approx. 120% of the mass of the snake and seriously impeded the snake’s ability to move; normal locomotion was impossible. The snake appeared to be using a body knotting technique. similar to that used by moray eels and sea snakes (Karthikeyan and Balasubramanian. 2008; Malcolm. 2016). to swallow this relatively large prey item.Lastly. we report the predation of an adult Webb’s tufted-tailed rat (Eliurus webbi Ellerman 1949) by M. meridionalis (Fig. 3A). The event took place on 21 February 2012 at night. While walking on a sandy forest path (-24.771117; 47.171600; 7 m asl). we observed the adult snake already consuming its prey (at 22: 26 h).

I present a unique temporal study of phytoplankton. nutrient and environmental dynamics that focussed on the transitional period between sea-ice cover conditions and open waters in a coastal inlet of the Canadian Arctic during 2016. I also compared the 2016 experimental data with continuous observations made by the Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) underwater observatory. Surface seawater sampling was conducted in Cambridge Bay with high temporal resolution from June 16 to August 3. to measure phytoplankton carbon and nitrate utilisation. silica production. phytoplankton biomass. phytoplankton taxonomy and dissolved nutrients. Throughout the study period. nitrate concentrations averaged 0.67  0.08 µmol L-1. and chlorophyll a and primary production were low at 0.11  0.005 µg L-1 and 0.25  0.02 µmol C L-1 d-1. respectively. The presence of sea-ice reduced physical mixing. which resulted in low surface nitrate concentrations. Phytoplankton assemblages. production rates and biomass were dominated by small flagellated cells (<5 µm) until late July. yet increases in temperature and nitrate later in the season enabled larger Chaetoceros spp. diatoms to bloom. The Chaetoceros bloom coincided with a peak in silica production (0.429 µmol Si L-1 d-1). which was otherwise low. but variable. The time series was divided into three phases based on changes in environmental conditions. these phases were used to evaluate changes in biological dynamics. Phase I was characterised by sea-ice. low nitrate and increasing phytoplankton biomass and primary production.

Here. we have scrutinized the correlation between serum levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in PIH.Methods: Serum samples were collected from 80 Iraqi women (40 women with PIH as patients group. 20 normotensive pregnant women as a positive control. and 20 normotensive non-pregnant women as a negative control) all groups were diagnosed clinically.Results: Serum of H2O2 and SOD levels was measured for all studied groups. Results showed that there were no significant variances in age and gestational age distribution between all studied groups. Furthermore. result showed that the serum level of SOD was a highly significant decrease in PIH in compared to control groups while H2O2 was a highly significant increase in PIH in compared with control groups. The obtained results also indicated that there was a negative correlation between SOD and H2O2 PIH women while no correlation in other control groups.Conclusion: Our study showed that there was a correlation between H2O2 levels and SOD in PIH. These imbalance lead to generate oxidative stress that could be responsible for starting and progression of pathological processes related to PIH and may be a critical determinant of diseases. Testing for SOD and H2O2 level can be a monitoring instrument for oxidative stress in early pregnancy. and they could help in the detection and consequently prevent future hypertension in pregnancy.,True,X0U4ZKIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lina_Salih4/publication/333150066_HYDROGEN_PEROXIDE_LEVELS_CORRELATE_WITH_SUPEROXIDE_DISMUTASE_IN_IRAQI_WOMEN_WITH_PREGNANCY-INDUCED_HYPERTENSION/links/5cddf232458515712eb06d05/HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE-LEVELS-CORRELATE-WITH-SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE-IN-IRAQI-WOMEN-WITH-PREGNANCY-INDUCED-HYPERTENSION.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lina_Salih4/publication/333150066_HYDROGEN_PEROXIDE_LEVELS_CORRELATE_WITH_SUPEROXIDE_DISMUTASE_IN_IRAQI_WOMEN_WITH_PREGNANCY-INDUCED_HYPERTENSION/links/5cddf232458515712eb06d05/HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE-LEVELS-CORRELATE-WITH-SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE-IN-IRAQI-WOMEN-WITH-PREGNANCY-INDUCED-HYPERTENSION.pdf,0,0,0

These releases have negative effects on the carbon cycle. which has a direct effect on the life over the Earth. The urbanization causes a wide pie on the chart of carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore; architects and engineers have to look for new solutions in their designs and products to achieve zero emission release. But it is generally overlooked that the process of construction has its own big slice. around 40%. resulting in emissions. during the construction process itself (from materials extraction. processing. transportation. assembly etc.). Thus it usually harms the carbon cycle in the environment and is considered to have an impact on climate change.This paper aims to investigate if another kind of architecture is possible by linking biodesign and bioarchitecture concepts and using them to rehabilitate the carbon cycle. It focuses on two case studies of bio-design in architecture which offers novel low carbon emission construction process by creating the product by or within the nature itself; Neri Oxman’s Silk Pavilion and Wolf Hilbertz’s Sea-Autopia Ampere (Eco-Island City) proposals.“A new approach to eco-construction methods can be achieved by Bio-Architecture”; is the hypothesis of the study.

There are a number of approaches to this problem ranging from detailed shading and orientation calculations to adaptive structures. This paper investigates learning from fibrous structures in nature to regulate the sun with case studies including Jenny Sabin’s MOMA PS1 pavilion. Stuttgart University’s Elytra pavilion and Neri Oxman’s silk pavilion. Neri Oxman’s silk pavilion made use of seasonal sun-path diagram mapping of solar trajectories in space to compute the material organization and also made use of live silkworms to deposit silk on a 3D fibrous filament frame. Jenny Sabin’s Pavilion was used to hold concerts and only humidification mechanism was necessary for climate moderation. In the Elytra Pavilion. the designers dynamically kept track of the temperature and lighting changes inside and showed that the design succeeded in providing the desired solar control. All of the cases showcase innovative automated 3D construction technologies from linear elements to create complex geometries generated by computer simulations.

Irvine (UCI) community. We describe a system for wide dissemination of the Stop the Bleedsm campaign that could be used for any university or large business setting.Introduction: Following a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 that resulted in twenty-eight fatalities. twenty of which were children. the Joint Committee to Create a National Policy to Enhance Survivability from Intentional Mass-Casualty and Active Shooter Events was founded. 1 The American College of Surgeons (ACS) led the committee. which included representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. the Major Cities Chiefs Association. and the Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC). It followed the guiding principle that no one should die from uncontrolled bleeding at an intentional mass-casualty or active shooter event. 2 In 2015. the committee modified its focus from relying solely on law enforcement and professional first responders to empowering the general public through education in hemorrhage control. This new approach allowed the number of immediate responders who could provide hemorrhage control to increase significantly. 3 Together with the White House. they developed the Stop the Bleedsm campaign. which teaches participants to provide hemorrhage control and. as a result. receive certification in Bleeding Control (B-Con) Basic. 4. 5,True,JMUat5oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://escholarship.org/content/qt27v488hp/qt27v488hp.pdf,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt27v488hp/qt27v488hp.pdf,0,0,0

1093097,Effect of Environment Factors on Life Cycle of Forensic Entomology: A Review.,2020,Nassreen N Mzhr and Zaid Raad Abbas and Zaid Naji Hassan,14,,4,,,Pests play an important ecological part in organic matter decomposition. As a natural means of survival. sarcosaprophagous fly usually prefers to locate and consume a food source such as a cadaver as a natural means of survival. Sarcosaprohagous fly larvae are frequently encountered by judicial entomologists during post mortem investigations. The most relevant colonizers are the oldest individuals derived from the first eggs placed on the body. The stage of the oldest maggots provides the accurate estimate of post mortem interval. Judicial entomology is predictable in numerous countries as a serious tool for forensic investigations. Judicial entomology requires extensive information on the local pest population. is subject to many environmental factors (temperature being one of the principle variables). and they need access to the bodies.

This study aims to evaluate the potential of using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to monitor vegetation cover change over Babylon governorate for the period of 2000-2016. The study focused also on minimizing the effects of soil background by using the standard adjustment factor L= 0.5 and improving vegetation canopy spectra. A Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of spatial resolution 250 m was used to derive NDVI. SAVI and NDWI indices. The NDVI values were strongly responded to seasonality with highest NDVI values during winter and spring periods in compared with the lowest values during the 5-months summer period from May to September. The shape of NDVI and SAVI trend was quite parallel and SAVI values were more than NVDI values for the seventeen studies years. The results showed that NDWI was more sensitive to the vegetation cover variation in compared to NDVI and SAVI. According to NDVI.

Ensuring that an egg is fertilized by a single sperm is essential for progression through embryogenesis. Eggs therefore have multiple mechanisms to prevent sperm entry into an already fertilized egg. In the slow polyspermy block. fertilization induces exocytosis of cortical granules. which are enriched with compounds that transform the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding eggs into a barrier impenetrable by sperm. The underlying mechanisms that enable the creation of this protective barrier are largely-unknown. We hypothesize that extracellular zinc may contribute to the slow block. It has recently been shown in mice. primates. and humans that cortical granules are enriched with zinc; furthermore …,True,th3uGQ8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(18)34095-5.pdf,,,,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(18)34095-5.pdf,0,0,0

In a subsequent work we will examine further on the biology of the group and on the life history of this genus. taxon by taxon. Taxonomy–The Buteos are a genus in the family Acciptridae. The beta taxonomy of this family is rather ambiguous. I will not go in depth with the current practice of puttiing this family in its own order (Acciptriformes) separate completely from the Falcons (Falconiformes: Falconidae). This seems largely superfluous to me. and having the two families in separate Parvorders (in the same order) makes much more sense. However. I will not debate this now. but at sometime in the near future. I will release a perspective debating this issue. and presenting logical evidences for this arrangement.

It has a volume of 1.4× 1015 km3 (the volume of about 1300 Earths). a density of 1.3 g/cm3 (which is 4 times less dense than the Earth). a surface gravity of 20.9 m/s2. a surface area of 62.179.600.600 km2. a circumference of 449.197 km. with an average temperature of-148 C. It has a 9: 55 rotational period. and an orbital period of 4333 Earth rotational periods. Its Mass is 1.90× 1027 kg. more than double that of all the other planets combined. Though not yet verified. scientists believe that the atmospheric pressure on Jupiter could be 30 million times that of the Earth (1.03 kg/cm2). 1 Jupiter has three known rings. They were Discovered by Voyager 1 in 1979. They are not visible from Earth. but when backlit against the Sun. the rings are easily distinguishable. The Composition of Jupiter is essentially Hydrogen (H) and Helium (He). with traces of Methane (CH4). Ammonia (NH3). Hydrogen Sulfide (H2SO3). and Dihydrogen monoxide (H2O). Sulfur (S) and Phosphorous (P) may also be present. 2 Jupiter’s Atmospheric Depth is highly debated. Some scientist believe that the Atmosphere has three layers that together equal about 44 miles in depth. 3 Another,True,Vc1V25wAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Avery_Forrest/publication/338084012_Descriptive_Planetary_Cosmology_1_Jupiter_a_Solaris_V/links/5dfd3127a6fdcc283731a19c/Descriptive-Planetary-Cosmology-1-Jupiter-a-Solaris-V.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Avery_Forrest/publication/338084012_Descriptive_Planetary_Cosmology_1_Jupiter_a_Solaris_V/links/5dfd3127a6fdcc283731a19c/Descriptive-Planetary-Cosmology-1-Jupiter-a-Solaris-V.pdf,0,0,0

1093187,EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND APPLIED GROWTH REGULATORS ON GROWTH. CYTOKININ PRODUCTION AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES OF PEPPERS (CAPSICUM ANNUUM L.)(ARIZONA).,1985,Sami Reshak Laibi,,,,,The University of Arizona.,Pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L.) were grown in field and a greenhouse in Arizona to determine the effects of water stress. root temperature. and exogenously applied growth regulators on cytokinin production and the resulting growth. Research showed that vegetative plants were significantly higher in cytokinin activity and growth parameters than fruiting plants. Also. in root-pruned fruiting plants. cytokinin activity was less than that of intact fruiting plants. In vegetative plants. the competition between removed sinks and the rest of the shoot was reduced and. hence. more cytokinin came from the roots to the shoots. Besides. additional carbohydrates were available and recycled to the roots. In respect to temperature effect. elevating temperature from 15 to 30°C had a pronounced effect of increasing the growth rate and cytokinin activity. The measured parameters declined when temperature exceeded 30°C. Temperatures between 25 and 30°C were found to be optimum. Under experimental conditions. growth regulators (Cytex® and Burst®) applied to the soil or foliage had no significant effect on growth rates or cytokinin activity in roots. Also. applying Burst® or kinetin to the nutrient medium had inconsistent and statistically nonsignificant effects on photosynthesis and transpiration.,True,zAqDo-UAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/188004,,,,https://repository.arizona.edu/bitstream/handle/10150/188004/azu_td_8522815_sip1_w.pdf?sequence=6,0,0,0

Both treatments were compared to bare soil with drip and to a furrow treatment. The crop response was significantly greater for mulched treatments as indicated by number of flowers and fruits. yield and fresh and dry weights. Chili responded less to mulch than green bell. Defective fruits were associated more with bare soil except with sunburn fruits which appeared more in green bell on aluminum mulch. The favorable response to aluminum appears to be a result of a favorable microclimate around the plant brought about by water conservation. soil temperature modification and light redistribution.,True,zAqDo-UAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://repository.arizona.edu/bitstream/handle/10150/274711/azu_td_1320395_sip1_m.pdf?sequence=1,,,,https://repository.arizona.edu/bitstream/handle/10150/274711/azu_td_1320395_sip1_m.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

They rarely exist in nature as free aglycons. instead. they attach to one or more sugar moieties. Anthocyanins are found within different plant organs; flowers. leaves. fruits. roots. tubers and grains. They appear in different attractive colours depending on their structure. pH. and other factors. These compounds gained a lot of attention in the last few years as food colourants replacing chemical dyes. besides their role in enhancing plant tolerance against many abiotic stresses such as salinity. drought. excessive light. ultraviolet radiation and cold stress. Besides. previous studies demonstrated the importance of anthocyanins in human health and their protective properties against chronic diseases. Hence. this review focuses on anthocyanins as one of the most important pigments having beneficial roles in health for plants and humans.,True,dPuMrB4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://au.edu.sy/images/files/ipubs/2020/k-t-10-3.pdf,,,,https://au.edu.sy/images/files/ipubs/2020/k-t-10-3.pdf,0,0,0

Pasien sepsis dengan infeksi bakteri penghasil ESBL 57. 4% terinfeksi E. coli. 21. 35% terinfeksi Enterobacter sp. dan 21. 3% terinfeksi Klebsiella sp. Sepsis dapat diperberat oleh peningkatan kuman yang multiresisten terhadap bermacam antibiotik. seperti E. coli ESBL dan K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Selama infeksi bakteri. faktor virulen diproduksi dan disekresikan dari patogen dan memicu sinyal apoptosis. Penelitian mengenai caspase 3 dianggap penting. karena caspase 3 merupakan efektor caspase terpenting yang bertanggungjawab atas morfologi dan perubahan biologis yang terlihat pada sel apoptosis. Jenis penelitian ini adalah true experimental dengan rancangan penelitian post test only control group design. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa ekspresi caspase 3 pada limpa mencit yang diinfeksi KPC adalah 65. 25±12. 69%. sedangkan yang diinfeksi E. coli ESBL adalah 33. 75±3.862%. hal tersebut diduga karena adanya kapsul polisakarida yang mengelilingi KPC dan melindungi dirinya terhadap aksi fagositosis dan bakterisidal serum yang dapat dianggap sebagai penentu virulensi paling penting dari KPC dan menyebabkan mitokondria melepaskan ROS. Infeksi bakteri tersebut menyebabkan mitokondria memproduksi ROS dan memicu pelepasan sitokrom c.

This study evaluates the spatial variation of benthic macrofaunal communities. sediments. and heavy metals in the sub-Arctic coastal ecosystems around Sept-Îles (Québec. Canada)—a major port area in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Physical sediment properties varied in the studied area. with a general sandy-silty profile except for specific locations in Baie des Sept Îles where higher organic matter and heavy metal concentrations were detected. Macrofaunal assemblages were evaluated for two taxa size classes (organisms> 0.5 mm and> 1 mm) and linked to habitat parameters using regression models. Communities of smaller organisms showed signs of perturbation for one assemblage close to industrial activities at Baie des Sept Îles. with an increased number of tolerant and opportunistic species. contrasting to neighboring regions whose compositions were similar to other ecosystems in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

With the end of that timeframe in sight. and despite major advancements in biodiversity conservation. evidence suggests that the majority of the Targets are unlikely to be met. This article is part of a series of perspective pieces from the 4th World Conference on Marine Biodiversity (May 2018. Montréal. Canada) to identify next steps towards successful biodiversity conservation in marine environments. We specifically reviewed holistic environmental assessment studies (HEA) and their contribution to reaching the Targets. Our analysis was based on multiple environmental approaches which can be considered as holistic. and we discuss how HEA can contribute to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in the near future. We found that only a few HEA articles considered a specific Biodiversity Target in their research. and that Target 11. which focuses on marine protected areas. was the most commonly cited. We propose five research priorities to enhance HEA for marine biodiversity conservation beyond 2020:(i) expand the use of holistic approaches in environmental assessments.(ii) standardize HEA vocabulary.(iii) enhance data collection. sharing and management.(iv) consider ecosystem spatio-temporal variability and (v) integrate ecosystem services in HEA. The consideration of these priorities will promote the value of HEA and will benefit the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity.,True,EX1b0Q8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://peerj.com/articles/8171/,,,,https://peerj.com/articles/8171/,0,0,0

This study addressed the gap of knowledge on the effect of air pollutants on sperm DNA fragmentation. comparing the seminal parameters from men living in locations with different levels of air pollution. The detrimental effects of environmental pollution in the Taranto area are alarming: the high level of pollutants released from the steel plants in the atmosphere can cause health and fertility issues. Our study analyzed sperm samples from three groups of patients: i) workers of Taranto steel plants; ii) Taranto residents; iii) Palermo residents. assumed as controls. Results demonstrate that patients from the “steel plants workers” group. constantly exposed to environmental pollutants for professional reasons. show a mean percentage of sperm DNA fragmentation above 30%. In contrast. patients from the “Taranto residents” group and controls show mean percentages ranging between 16.8% and 25%. respectively. We suggest that sperm DNA evaluation can either be an indicator of individual reproductive health. and a suitable tool to connect the surrounding environment with its effects. On the other end. preliminary data of the Eco Food Fertility project3 indicated an impairment of several semen quality parameters. including increased sperm DNA damage. in clinically healthy male volunteers living in areas with high environmental impact. Since the methods to study pollutants effects have still to be validated. we suggest that studying sperm DNA fragmentation could serve as a valuable biomarker of the presence and …,True,IlROStqWiFQC:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://iris.unipa.it/handle/10447/238012,,,,,0,0,0

The industrialization and urbanization has already brought a change in the society wherein the women also have started to earn for a living which is not only because of ambition but in order to run their homes. The joint families are breaking and more and more nuclear families are coming into existence. Thus in such changing times it is the children who become the bait of parents struggle and stress. In such conditions the preschools should offer something which provides them more then education. The researcher in this paper has tried to come out with a solution that can provide kids with support. love and care and take care of their social and emotional needs which they can get deprived off. The educationist. psychologists and theorists have given a lot of principles on which today’s early childhood education is based on. All this literature is like a goldmine from within which the present researchers can still extract lots of gold. The researcher has done the same. After going through all these theories the researcher has tried to extract some tenets that can be applied for the social and emotional development and learning.

These also include various indigenous cartoon shows. The global research indicates that 85 percent of a child’s core brain structure is already complete in the early years. Hence these are the years where extra care needs to be taken regarding what we are showing our kids. how we are behaving in front of them. giving them enough opportunities of in hand experiences etc. It becomes very important that the environment in which we are upbringing them is happy. healthy. safe and filled with love and is far-far away from violence.

One of the best known and widely utilized polycultures is the milpa cropping system-the cultivation of maize. beans. and squash together as “the three sisters.” Milpa has been utilized by the indigenous population of Central America for millennia due to its consistent abundant harvests; today it remains a cornerstone of the region’s tradition. diet. and economic growth. Likely contributing to this legacy is the known association of polycultures and heightened resistance to disease. yet the mechanism underlying this relationship in milpa has largely been unexplored. To assess the health of farm soil exposed to milpa monocrops. bicrops. and multicrops. we measured the growth of two bacterial strains: a Burkholderia strain symbiotic of Anasa tristis (the squash bug. an agricultural pest) and a plant pathogenic Serratia strain that is the primary causal agent of cucurbit yellow vine disease (CYVD). We found that after one week in both the polyculture (corn. bean. and squash) soil and the corn monoculture soil. the growth of Burkholderia was significantly inhibited. However. in both corn & bean and bean & squash biculture soils. the growth of the strain was significantly enhanced. The growth of the Serratia strain did not yield any significant increase or decrease after one week in any milpa soil. We conclude that the cultivation of milpa in its polyculture configuration demonstrates antibiotic activity towards the Burkholderia strain SQ4A.

The results were revealded that vegetable crops are easy-to-root with variation in rooting percentage. so the highest rooting response was represented by pumpkin squash and the lower was represented by Watermelon. On the other hand fruit trees and ornamentals can be divided into three groups according to their easy or difficult to rooting response: 1-) Easy-to-root cuttings in presence or absence of auxin. such as Mours 2)-Easy–to–root cuttings in presence of auxin (100%) and to half of that (50%) in the absence of auxin such as pink Oleander. 3)-Difficult-to-root cuttings are divided into two groups: A)-Absolute-difficulty-to-root cuttings even in case of supplying auxin such as orange and Pear. B)-difficult-to–root cuttings at rate of 25% in absence of auxin and 37% in presence of auxin such as White oleander. Consequently. the difficulty–to-root cuttings might be attributed to the presence of inhibitors as cutting exudates. To verity this suggestion.

TNF stimulation leads to the formation of two distinct signalling complexes. a well-defined membrane bound complex (complex 1). and a less well characterised cytosolic death inducing complex (complex 2). Using mass spectrometry. we identified the ADP-ribosyltransferase. tankyrase-1 (TNKS1/TNKS/ARTD5/PARP5a) as a novel native complex 2 component. Following a TNF-induced death stimulus TNKS1 is recruited to complex 2. resulting in complex 2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). Tankyrase inhibitors sensitise cells to TNF-induced death. which is correlated with increased complex 2 assembly. Tankyrase-mediated PARylation promotes recruitment of the E3 ligase RNF146 and RNF146 deficiency or proteasome inhibition results in increased levels of complex 2. suggesting that RNF146 causes proteasomal degradation of complex 2. Several viruses express ADP-ribose binding macrodomain proteins. and expression of the SARS-CoV-2 or VEEV macrodomain markedly sensitises cells to TNF-induced death. This suggests that ADP-ribosylation serves as yet another mechanism to detect pathogenic interference of TNF signalling and retaliate with an inflammatory cell death.,True,u4kG97oAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.09.430424v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/02/09/2021.02.09.430424.full.pdf,0,0,0

In this process. T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) activation stimulates translocation of the downstream kinase PKCθ to the membrane. leading to NF-κB activation and thus transcription of relevant genes. However. the details of how PKCθ is recruited to the membrane remain enigmatic. It is known that annexin A5 (ANXA5). a calcium-dependent membrane-binding protein. has been reported to mediate PKCδ activation by interaction with PKCδ. a homologue of PKCθ. which implicates a potential role of ANXA5 involved in PKCθ signaling.

Although the development of IELs has been studied in some detail. the molecular cues controlling their local development remain unclear. Here. we demonstrate that FADD. a classic adaptor protein required for death-receptor-induced apoptosis. is a critical regulator of the intestinal IEL development. The mice with a dominant negative mutant of FADD (FADD-DN) display an abnormal development of intestinal IELs with a marked reduction in the numbers of CD8αα+TCRγδ+ T cells. As a precursor for CD8αα+ development. lamina propria lymphocytes in lin-negative expression (lin- LPLs) were analyzed and the massive accumulation of IL-7R-lin- LPLs was observed in FADD-DN mice. As IL-7R is one of Notch1-target genes. we further observed that the level of Notch1 expression was lower in Lin- LPLs from FADD-DN mice compared with normal mice. The downregulation of Notch1 expression induced by FADD-DN overexpression was also confirmed in Jurkat T cells. Considering that IL-7 and its receptor IL7-R play a differentiation inducing role in the development of intestinal IELs. the influence of FADD via its DD domain on Notch1 expression might be a possible molecular signal involved in the early IELs development. In addition. loss of γδ T-IELs in FADD-DN mice aggravates DSS-induced colitis. suggesting that FADD is a relevant contribution to the field of mucosal immunology and intestinal homeostasis.,True,u4kG97oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02038/full,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02038/full,0,0,0

The population/sample for the study was sixty (60) Biology students comprising of 32 males and 28 females were randomly drawn from one of the secondary schools in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. Three (3) research questions were answered in the study and two (2) hypotheses were tested at a significant level of 0.05. The instrument used to collect relevant data from the students is GAT (Genetics Achievement Test). Mean. standard deviation and t-test statistical analysis were used to analyze the two hypotheses formulated for the study. The result of the analysis revealed that: there is significant difference between the post-test mean scores of students taught genetics using concept-mapping and those taught using demonstration method. The results also showed that there is no significant difference between the post-test mean scores of male and female students taught genetics using cooperative method. The recommendations derived from this study includes; Biology teachers should adopt the used of concept-mapping method in the teaching of genetics in the secondary schools. Curriculum planners should incorporate concept mapping in the curriculum and Teachers should be train and re-trained on how to effectively use the concept mapping method in the teaching of genetics and biology in general.,True,MxpfLHgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,http://ijhumas.com/ojs/index.php/kiuhums/article/view/428,,,,http://ijhumas.com/ojs/index.php/kiuhums/article/download/428/400,0,0,0

Salmonella typhi is a bacterium that causes typhoid fever. Antibiotic treatment is often used but fails due to bacterial resistance to antibiotics. An alternative treatment is required to gradually substitute synthetic antibiotic. One of this potential is given by turmeric (Curcuma longa). The purpose of this research was to know the potential of turmeric as in silico antibacterial agent for Salmonella typhi using docking method. Docking result showed that the five compounds produced different values​​ on the affinity and rmsd binding parameters. The highest affinity binding value was the Ciprofloxacin compound. the lowest was Bisdemethoxycurcumin compound. The highest rmsd value was Demethoxycurcumin. while the lowest was Xanthorrhizol. and the result revealed that all compounds have bioaffinity properties. Based on the results. three compounds derived from turmeric (demethoxycurcumin. bisdemethoxy curcumin and xanthorrizol) are still not effectively used as antibacterial agent for Salmonella typhi due to the absence of equality of amino acid residues between alternative compounds turmeric with compounds which has been clinically tested as a drug and ineffective use of receptor proteins that result in less optimal alternative compounds.,True,ZIXyBRwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://jurnal.unej.ac.id/index.php/BIOED/article/view/9476,,,,https://jurnal.unej.ac.id/index.php/BIOED/article/download/9476/6292,0,0,0

Insect wing architectural design is believed to be an excellent system for studying morphological variation because of their firm or solidly cleared structures. It has been the center of geometric morphometric investigation in the past since insect’s wing pattern can provide details on their evolutionary history and flight performance. Wing shape and size disparity of fifty-nine individuals of bumblebee was explored to explain and figure out biological structure variation within similar species. Examination in both left and right forewings and hind wings was also considered to find out if phenotypic sexual dimorphism exists. The outline-based geometric morphometric technique was employed in this study to measure and evaluate wing shape and size variation among bumblebees. Results from mean shapes and scatter plot diagrams analysis revealed that individuals of bumblebee differ less with respect to shape. Overlapping of individuals is visible on both wings in both sexes. which,True,y2jlvD0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/36204140/Published_Paper.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/36204140/Published_Paper.pdf,0,0,0

1093355,OUTLINE BASED GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF WING SHAPE AND SIZE IN SELECTED SPECIES OF BEES,2014,Ray Vincent E Araña,,,,,,The complex shape of an organism cannot easily be summarized by using linear measurements as in traditional morphometrics (Pavlinov 2001). Because these measurements are highly correlated with size. much effort was spent for size correction (Zelditch et al. 2004). But there is no consensus on different size correction methods and several difficulties remain. For instance. the homologies of linear distances are difficult to assess and the same set of distance measures can be obtained from totally different shapes (Zelditch et al. 2004). In general. it is not feasible to generate graphical representations of shapes from the linear distances (Adams et al. 2004).Morphological features are an important source of information for many areas of biological investigation. including systematics and taxonomy. Most studies in these areas are done using meristic and morphometric characteristics. Meristic characteristics are generally countable and informative for species. genera and higher taxonomic levels. However. in interspecific and populational studies. these measurements are not informative and it is therefore necessary to obtain information on morphometric characteristics (Bookstein et al. 1985). These characteristics are generally quantitative phenotypic values obtained from continuous measurements and ratios in which classes are often defined based on means and standard,True,y2jlvD0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/36359508/Outline_Based_Geometric_Morphometric_Analysis_of_Bees_Wings.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/36359508/Outline_Based_Geometric_Morphometric_Analysis_of_Bees_Wings.pdf,0,0,0

Many waste streams and effluents contain high concentrations of valuable nutrients. but chemical treatments and recovery processes are both fiscally and energetically expensive. Microalgae are well-studied for use in biological nutrient recovery systems. but conventional culture techniques still have significant shortcomings. especially regarding energy balancing. This study sampled microalgae and photosynthetic consortia from the local environment and artificially adapted them to blended. untreated wastewaters using a stepwise bioprospecting approach. Liquid biogas digestate (BD) was selected for its high phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and difficulties associated with recycling. while aquaculture effluent (ACE) was selected to dilute BD for its slightly acidic pH. low …,True,sO30fkoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,3,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894720316958,9074138782282202756,/scholar?cites=9074138782282202756,,,0,0,0

This makes these production systems vulnerable to ecological disturbances. Quantifying the densities of feral honey bees is key to determining the reliance of free pollination services and system vulnerability. Current methods for estimating densities of feral honey bee hives are based on the number of haplotypes identified from drones caught using a pheromone lure. This method assumes that all hives contribute to the drone population. and that the area over which they are attracted is known. To test these assumptions the estimates based on drone capture should be compared to the genetic composition of hives in the same area. We developed a flag and pole method to sample worker sting DNA from feral hives in trees.

1093406,The Saltpan Microbiome Is Structured by Sediment Depth and Minimally Influenced by Variable Hydration,2020,Eric A Weingarten and Lauren A Lawson and Colin R Jackson,8,Microorganisms,4,538,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Saltpans are a class of ephemeral wetland characterized by alternating periods of inundation. rising salinity. and desiccation. We obtained soil cores from a saltpan on the Mississippi Gulf coast in both the inundated and desiccated state. The microbiomes of surface and 30 cm deep sediment were determined using Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Bacterial and archaeal community composition differed significantly between sediment depths but did not differ between inundated and desiccated states. Well-represented taxa included marine microorganisms as well as multiple halophiles. both observed in greater proportions in surface sediment. Functional inference of metagenomic data showed that saltpan sediments in the inundated state had greater potential for microbial activity and that several energetic and degradation pathways were more prevalent in saltpan sediment than in nearby tidal marsh sediment. Microbial communities within saltpan sediments differed in composition from those in adjacent freshwater and brackish marshes. These findings indicate that the bacterial and archaeal microbiomes of saltpans are highly stratified by sediment depth and are only minimally influenced by changes in hydration. The surface sediment community is likely isolated from the shallow subsurface community by compaction. with the microbial community dominated by marine and terrestrial halophiles.

1093408,Bacteria in Salt Pans Along the Mississippi Gulf Coast,2019,Lauren A Lawson,,,,,,Salt pans form in shallow depressions in the ground where salt water evaporates leaving a hypersaline environment remaining. These pans become flooded during extremely high tides and as time progresses. this additional salt water is evaporated leaving behind more salt deposits. Marine salt pans can provide habitat for halophilic microorganisms and provide an interesting environment for study as conditions can change with both sediment and water depth. Towards the surface of sediment in salt pans. oxygen is still available. however. deeper sediments have limited oxygen availability and are likely anaerobic. Deeper sediments can also have higher salt concentrations so may provide an optimal environment for anaerobic halophiles. Samples were taken in July and October 2018. when the salt pans were dry and flooded. and from the surface and 30cm deep in the sediment. DNA was extracted and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene sequenced to determine the bacterial microbiome. Bacterial communities were compared between the surface and deeper samples and flooded and dry samples. Samples taken from surface sediments had more bacterial sequences than those taken from deeper into the sediment. and surface samples accounted for 73% of the 105.000 sequences in the dataset. Salt pan bacterial communities were primarily composed of members of the Proteobacteria. Bacteroidetes. Cyanobacteria. and Planctomycetes. although a total of 21 distinct bacterial phyla were detected. These phyla differed in their distributions. with members of the Bacteroidetes. Cyanobacteria.

Corporate governance mechanisms examined comprise board size. board meetings. audit committee independence. audit committee meetings. big 4 audit firms and managerial ownership.  While earnings management is measured through discretionary accruals measured in accordance with the Modified Jones Model (1995). Results of the study indicate that larger board encourages earnings management through increased board diligence appears to have a controlling impact on profits manipulation by management. Further. we find that lower percentage of insider shareholding encourages earnings manipulation. This could stem from the overriding influence of larger block holders and institutional shareholders on the smaller shareholders for the achievement of short term profits by firm leading to earnings management. While more independent members on audit committees encourage earnings manipulation which is in line with the findings related to board size. We also find that more the board members meet. would reduce the earnings management practices. It suggests that board and audit committee members may encourage earnings manipulation from the need to protect their credibility and reputations in the markets by showing robust earnings and firm performance.

The animals responses to such stress determines its fitness. physiology and in case of chemical signals also its behaviour. If physical or chemical changes in the ecosystem make the detection of such a chemical impossible. then it can be reasonably assumed that vital behaviours of the animal will be significantly altered. Plastics are lighter. more durable. stronger and cheaper than other materials used for the same purposes. making them most suitable for producing a very broad range of goods and products. However. these same properties also make them serious environmental hazards i.e. they are easily carried and dispersed by water over long distances. and stopped by barriers and settle in the form of sediments that can persist for centuries. Phthalate esters are widely used as additives to offer flexibility to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins (Graham. 1973).

USSR,Data are presented concerning the action of N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) and diethyl sulfate (DES) on barley during the cultivation of M/sub 1/plants at an altitude of 2600 m and M/sub 2/plants at altitudes of 2600 and 3860 m above sea level. The frequency of morphophysiological mutations in the treated variants was higher and the range of variability was wider under mid-altitude (2600 m) conditions than under high-altitude conditions (3860 m). The number of semi-sterile and sterile plants was higher when the mutagen-treated variants were cultivated at an altitude of 3800 m. A brief description is presented of certain mutants which are of interest from the point of view of selection and genetics. Such mutants include dwarf forms. with dense ears and with a rye-like ear. and having variegated and glossy leaves.,True,iJDQHwcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5600721,,,,,0,0,0

Epstein-Barr virus is a well-known oncogenic virus. it is responsible for 10% of gastric carcinomas across the world. The aim of study was to determine the prevalence of EBV associated with GC in Sudanese patients.Method:Fifty Paraffin embedded blocks of gastric biopsy specimens diagnosed as gastric carcinoma were collected from Soba university hospital and Ribat teaching hospital. Khartoum. Sudan. DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue. and then Epstein-Barr virus gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Result:Among the gastric biopsy specimens 27 (54.0%) were of male and 23 (46.0%) were of female. Eleven EBV positive samples were found in gastric carcinomas (22.0%). 8 (72.7%) were of male and 3 (27.2%) were of female. The mean age of the patients was 56 years. the most positive cases were between 50-59 years old. and (10%) of them are alive in Khartoum.Conclusions:There exists an association between EBV and gastric carcinoma in some Sudanese patients.Accepted 22 Sep 2016; Published 28 Oct 2016;Academic Editor: Charlic Gourley.

Stroke is one of its most devastating complications. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 gene postulated to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of SS disease. Previous evidence has demonstrated that the nonsynonymous SNP. VCAM11238G˃ C (rs3783613). may be associated with protection from stroke while1594T˃ C (rs1041163) SNP had an association with stroke. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional. randomized study that included 131 patients diagnosed with (SCA). among them 40 subjects with history of clinical stroke and 91 subjects with other complications of (SCA). Genotyping of the VCAM1 SNPs was carried out using PCR-RFLP technique and confirmed by sequencing a subset of samples. The results were analyzed using bioinformatics tools. The aim of the present study was to detect the presence of VCAM1 SNPs (rs3783613) and (rs1041163) among Sudanese patients with (SCA) with and without ischemic stroke respectively to determine whether it has an influence on the risk of stroke. Results: Molecular analysis revealed presence of VCAM1 T1594 C mutant genotype among the stroke study group in only 21/40 (52.5%). We also found almost complete absence of VCAM1 G1238C polymorphism among the non-stroke patients. Conclusion: No association between VCAM1 1594Cvariant and stroke in our population of patients.

Because mammals are endothermic. body temperature can be used as a health marker for primates. Using a method previously tested on chimpanzees and humans. we estimated body temperature of wild Bornean orangutans by measuring the internal temperature of fecal samples. Upon quickly collecting a fecal sample after defecation. we recorded internal temperature of the sample at 20-sec intervals for six minutes. Data included a series of temperatures for each sample that we fitted to a sigmoid curve. which was used to estimate body temperature. Estimated body temperature was not affected by sex (F (2. 92)= 0.431. P= 0.651). weather (F (2. 92)= 1.175. P= 0.313). or collection time (r=-0.074. N= 95. P= 0.468). Estimated body temperature was higher for fecal samples that fell from lower estimated heights (r=-0.23. N= 95. P= 0.0004) and were heavier (r= 0.23. N= 75. P= 0.0475). We compare these results from the field to captive fecal samples. taking place on the ground. to determine the accuracy of this field method. From our field samples (N= 95). orangutans appear to have a lower internal body temperature (33.44±1.74 C) on average than either chimpanzees or humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that orangutans have a lower metabolic rate than other great apes. Lower body temperature may serve as a metabolic adaptation of orangutans to survive extended periods of low food availability when energy needs to be conserved.,True,purTTvUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10110993,10632411960608613723,/scholar?cites=10632411960608613723,,,0,0,0

Internal body temperature. a marker of health in endotherms. has been tested in humans and chimpanzees using two different fecal temperature methods: using the peak internal temperature (PIT) or applying a sigmoid curve (SC). We tested both methods on wild and rehabilitant Bornean orangutans to determine if either is a feasible methodology for arboreal mammals. The SC method involves a series of temperatures for each sample that we fitted to a sigmoid curve. whereas the PIT method involved a single peak temperature recording. Estimates from the two methods were not significantly different in either our wild (T (88)=-2.0781. P= 0.0406) or rehabilitant (T (29)=-2.8404. P= 0.0082) samples. Adult rehabilitant body temperatures (N= 9; 34.62±1.32 C) were estimated to be hotter than those in the wild (N= 107; 33.59±1.66 C). although not significantly different (T (115)= 1.9859; P= 0.0493). In our model. testing a number of factors. we found height of fecal drop (P= 0.0071). fecal weight (P= 0.0198). and time of day (P= 0.0029) to significantly affect body temperature estimates. Our field sample (N= 107) indicates that wild orangutans have an internal fecal temperature. ranging between 29.5 and 37.3 C. lower than mean temperatures for chimpanzees or humans. This supports the finding that orangutans have lower metabolic rates than do most other eutherian mammals.

Using a method tested on chimpanzees and humans. we estimated temperature of fecal samples of Bornean orangutans as a proxy for body temperature. Upon defecation. we recorded peak internal temperature of the samples. Estimated body temperature was influenced by height of defecation (r=-0.23. N= 95. P= 0.0004) and sample weight (r= 0.23. N= 75. P= 0.0475). These estimates were not affected by sex (F (2. 92)= 0.431. P= 0.651) or weather (F (2. 92)= 1.175. P= 0.313).

Cellulases are promising to be applied in natural products which may improve the yield of bioactive in plant extract through cellulose depolymerization. Cellulases from mixed culture of Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei can produce a high cellulase activity because of the synergism activity among endoglucanase. exoglucanase. and also β-glucoside. Cellulase production and partial purification of monoculture and mixed culture (1: 1) of these fungi on carboxymethylcellulose media were investigated in this study. Total cellulase activity was measured by filter paper assay followed by protein estimation with Bradford method. The crude extract of Aspergillus niger monoculture has the highest cellulase activity (0.131 U/mL. P< 005) followed by mixed culture (0.109 U/mL) and Trichoderma reesei (0.106 U/mL). The cellulase activity of partially purified cellulase from mixed culture significantly increased (0.335. 0.348. 0.374 U/mL.
