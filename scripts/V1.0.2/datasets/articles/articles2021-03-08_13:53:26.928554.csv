1172210,The persuasive effects of source credibility in buy and lease situations,1982,Robert R Harmon and Kenneth A Coney,19,Journal of Marketing research,2,255-260,SAGE Publications,The persuasive impact of source credibility is examined in two situations. A highly credible source was more effective than a moderately credible source when the communication recommended buying a product. an advocacy which message recipients viewed unfavorably. The moderately credible source was more persuasive when the message advocated leasing the product. a position subjects generally supported. These findings are interpreted in terms of cognitive response theory.

This article presents initial consumer evaluations of mobile location-based advertising (LBA). LBA is a new form of marketing communication that uses location-tracking technology in mobile networks to target consumers with location-specific advertising on their cell phones. We use an experimental setting to test the effects of LBA characteristics on privacy concerns about location tracking. perceived benefits. value. and intentions to try LBA. LBA was described as a free. opt-in service from cell phone service providers. Results indicate that privacy concerns are high. and perceived benefits and value of LBA are low.

1172212,Sustainable IT services: Assessing the impact of green computing practices,2009,Robert R Harmon and Nora Auseklis,,,,1707-1717,IEEE,Green computing refers to the practice of using computing resources more efficiently while maintaining or increasing overall performance. Sustainable IT services require the integration of green computing practices such as power management. virtualization. improving cooling technology. recycling. electronic waste disposal. and optimization of the IT infrastructure to meet sustainability requirements. Recent studies have shown that costs of power utilized by IT departments can approach 50% of the overall energy costs for an organization. While there is an expectation that green IT should lower costs and the firm’s impact on the environment. there has been far less attention directed at understanding the strategic benefits of sustainable IT services in terms of the creation of customer value. business value and societal value.

Pricing strategies are one of the most important challenges and decisions for today's IT service providers. Pricing strategies for IT services have traditionally focused on covering costs. achieving desired margins and meeting the competition. These pricing schemes range from simple approaches. easily copied by competitors. to complex models with high management costs. In order to be successful in today's competitive business world. the service providers need to define their pricing strategies by considering the customer's perceived value from the service they receive rather than using traditional cost-based pricing strategies.

This paper presents a formal comparison of TFDEA with a previously published application from Technological Forecasting and Social Change by Joseph Martino. Using the data and multiple-regression model from Martino. we compare results obtained from TFDEA to those previously published. Both techniques predict the first flights of fighter jets introduced between 1960 and 1982 by using first-flight data of aircraft introduced between 1944 and 1960. TFDEA was found to better predict the first-flight dates than the multiple-regression forecast.

1172223,Value-based pricing for new software products: strategy insights for developers,2005,Robert Harmon and David Raffo and Stuart Faulk,,the Proceedings of the Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology,,,,Software pricing has traditionally been focused on the vendor’s internal business objectives of covering costs. achieving specified margins. and meeting the competition. Pricing methods such as flat price. tiered pricing. MIPS-based. usage-based. per user. per seat. and pay as you go. are often tactical in nature and easily matched by competitors. which can undermine profitability by accelerating the commoditization process. Conversely. a value-based approach charges a price based on the customer’s perceived value of the benefits received. Value-based pricing methodologies can be used to estimate the market value of new software concepts at various stages of the development process in addition to pricing new products for launch. This paper describes a value-based approach to pricing that is dependent on the firm’s commitment to invest in the development of its long-term “pricing capital.” This investment in methodologies. infrastructure. and processes to create. measure. analyze. and capture customer value is the key to successful long-term pricing strategy.,True,L8rqv0EAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,57,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.135.8014&rep=rep1&type=pdf,14692674471589703241,/scholar?cites=14692674471589703241,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.135.8014&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1172235,Price sensitivity measurement and new product pricing: A cognitive response approach,2007,Robert R Harmon and Ramaprasad Unni and Timothy R Anderson,,,,1961-1967,IEEE,Understanding the price sensitivity of potential buyers is a requirement for successfully determining the price for a new product. Marketers desire to set a price that will maximize demand and ensure a profitable business result. The price sensitivity measurement approach to price setting provides a methodology for mapping the upper and lower bounds of acceptable prices from the customer's perspective. Price sensitivity measurement is based on value perceptions and is a useful tool for pricing new products.

Criteria affecting the decisions are taken from the literature. but were reviewed with energy authorities in Oregon in order to define the interactions.,True,kq4fXRYAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,18,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786451.2012.744311,12505764041393194214,/scholar?cites=12505764041393194214,,,0,0,0
1172256,Prediction of aircraft failure times using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms,2014,Ayca Altay and Omer Ozkan and Gulgun Kayakutlu,51,Journal of Aircraft,1,47-53,American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,The aviation industry lived through the global economic crisis by mergers and a review of cost cent factors. Maintaining a fleet is more delicate than ever because low price is the focus of demand. but providing safety is the greatest cost. These facts lead to dynamic maintenance of the aircraft in order to eliminate excessive maintenance costs while ensuring safety. Preemptive maintenance can be run only if the failure times of aircraft are predicted ahead of occurrence. This study aims to predict when the failure will happen by aircraft type and age. An application of 60 aircraft. which lived through 532 failures. is modeled with artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. which are known to be the preferred forecasting tools. The model proposed gives a good forecast correlation rate between the target and actual failure schedules of aircraft.,True,kq4fXRYAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,18,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.C031793,1611711703124993268,/scholar?cites=1611711703124993268,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayca_Altay/publication/260546605_Prediction_of_Aircraft_Failure_Times_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks_and_Genetic_Algorithms/links/54bd10ab0cf218d4a1696cd7/Prediction-of-Aircraft-Failure-Times-Using-Artificial-Neural-Networks-and-Genetic-Algorithms.pdf,0,0,0

The increase in knowledge-based resources request new assessment models. This study aims to demonstrate the divergence in value of the knowledge resources for different role players. Thus. knowledge management strategies can be reviewed as to support the future of the company. The case study is performed in a Turkish utility company. where. the role players have comparable influences on the future of the business. An integrated Delphi and fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based framework is used in analysis which also helps prioritising the balancing factors according to the different role players. Achievements in the case study led for a mind-shift of considering the accordance of the sustainability and the resource balancing goals for the utility sector.,True,kq4fXRYAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,14,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544208000285,5691065671842496210,/scholar?cites=5691065671842496210,,,0,0,0
1172258,Technology Assessment of Two Energy Portfolios Using with a Hierarchical Decision Model,2009,Donggyu Lim and Lawrence Carter and Noah Third and Willi Schweinfort and Paul Tibbot,,,,,,Nations take great interest in their energy policy as it ensures the quality of life for its people and also has a major impact on their economy. Within the context of the European Union. many benchmarks have been set in terms of increasing the use of renewable energy sources. but this alone is not adequate in providing base-load electricity supply. Member nations have chosen to go in different directions in addressing this issue based on factors such as political. economic and technological issues. Two nations that represent the vast extremes of national energy mix are France and Germany. France. due to low fossil fuel reserves. has chosen to develop and rely on nuclear energy as its primary source. Germany. on the other hand. has gone the way of renewable sources but still relies heavily on coal. The search for a technical assessment regarding these countries and their energy mix proved unsuccessful. but developing a Hierarchical Decision Model could prove to be beneficial for energy departments. It was thought a model could be built using the available information regarding the various energy mixes of the countries. Using the technologies as alternatives. and determining the criteria which each satisfied. a model was developed to show what each nation weighted as high importance. The study showed a couple results. First was that social/political factors were overwhelmingly low importance. It was also found to not completely reflect the countries’ portfolios. suggesting more research must be done to refine and extend the model. Also. experts need to be consulted and areas such as public opinion need to be quantified.

The problem becomes difficult mainly because the match has to be seen with the objectives of both sides. Assignment methods fail to respond to a multi-objective. multi-constraint problem with complicated match; whereas. metaheuristics is preferable based on computational simplicity. A conditional genetic algorithm is developed in this study to propose both global and composite match using different fitness functions. This algorithm kills the infeasibilities to achieve the maximum number of matches. The proposed algorithm is applied on an academic problem of multi-alternative candidates and multi-alternative tasks (m × n problem) in two stages. In the first stage. four different fitness functions are evaluated and in the second stage using one of the fitness …,True,kq4fXRYAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,9,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X0900417X,11782877156826292399,/scholar?cites=11782877156826292399,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X0900417X,0,0,0

The present study selected seven States and used the same districts and villages studied in the NFHS-2. to see if the reported reduction in prevalence of anaemia was due to health and nutrition inputs and/or due to a different method for haemoglobin estimation.Methods: A total of 1751 women (1148 pregnant and 603 lactating-exclusively breastfeeding up to3 months of age). from seven States-Himachal Pradesh and Haryana in north; Assam and Orissa in east; Kerala and Tamil Nadu in south and Madhya Pradesh in central India. were selected. Haemoglobin was estimated by the cyanmethaemoglobin method. so that comparison was possible with earlier studies. Data on socio-demographic characteristics. pregnancy. nutritional status and dietary intakes were collected.Results: Prevalence as well as severity of anaemia was significantly higher in the present study as compared to the NFHS-2 study data. The difference could be due to haemocue method. which gives higher haemoglobin values. The contributing factors found on multiple regression analysis for anaemia in pregnancy and lactation were: literacy. occupation and standard living index of the study women; their awareness about anaemia. its prevention by regular consumption of ironfolate tablets and increase in food intake. Maternal height. age of marriage. parity and foetal loss also contributed to haemoglobin level.

The APC deposits C3b on possible Ags. and the interaction with factor H determines whether the initial C3b activates the APC. Factor H is composed of a linear array of 20 homologous short consensus repeats (SCR) domains with many functional sites. Three of these sites are involved in binding C3b and regulating complement activation; others bind to sialic acid and/or heparin and are responsible for host recognition. Using site-directed mutations we have examined the contributions of each of these sites to target discrimination and to functional activities of factor H. Decay acceleration by SCR1–4 of C3/C5 convertases bound to nonactivators was strongly dependent on SCR domains 11–15 and 16–20.

Assuming a fixed active set. the optimal solution can be expressed in a general state‐feedback closed form. which corresponds to a piecewise linear controller for the linear model case. Changes in the original unconstrained solution by the active constraints and other effects related to the loss of degrees of freedom are depicted in this analysis. In addition to modifications in the unconstrained feedback gain. we show that the presence of active output constraints can introduce extra feedback terms in the predictive controller.

Mass. energy and pressure balances are performed for each of these sections.Simulation results for steady state are presented and compared qualitatively to those obtained from previous FCC models. The dynamic behaviour of the system is explored through two perturbations in open loop. one on the fresh feed flow rate and one on the air flow rate to the first regenerator.

This design problem is characterized by considerable complexity. high dimensionality. nonlinear behavior of the physical models. and multi-objective nature. To avoid most of these limitations. a two-step methodology is introduced. where the problem is initially reformulated in terms of some of the decision variables used. In the second phase. the determination of the remaining complicating variables is completed. from the solution obtained during the previous step.

Here a multiple shooting formulation is proposed. where a process model is integrated separately inside each sampling interval. and the corresponding equality constraints are added directly to the optimization problem. It is shown that the resulting formulation provides a more reliable framework for the solution of predictive control problems. both in the linear and nonlinear cases.

1172457,Adaptive grid semidefinite programming for finding optimal designs,2018,Belmiro PM Duarte and Weng Kee Wong and Holger Dette,28,Statistics and Computing,2,441-460,Springer US,We find optimal designs for linear models using a novel algorithm that iteratively combines a semidefinite programming (SDP) approach with adaptive grid techniques. The proposed algorithm is also adapted to find locally optimal designs for nonlinear models. The search space is first discretized. and SDP is applied to find the optimal design based on the initial grid. The points in the next grid set are points that maximize the dispersion function of the SDP-generated optimal design using nonlinear programming. The procedure is repeated until a user-specified stopping rule is reached. The proposed algorithm is broadly applicable. and we demonstrate its flexibility using (i) models with one or more variables and (ii) differentiable design criteria. such as A-. D-optimality. and non-differentiable criterion like E-optimality. including the mathematically more challenging case when the minimum eigenvalue of the …,True,iAXRSzcAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,5,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-017-9741-y,16313272470702707371,/scholar?cites=16313272470702707371,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt0p9068t9/qt0p9068t9.pdf,0,0,0
1172458,Moving finite elements method applied to dynamic population balance equations,2008,Belmiro PM Duarte and Cristina MSG Baptista,54,AIChE journal,3,673-692,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. A Wiley Company,A moving finite elements scheme is developed and used for solving 1‐D dynamic population balance equations (PBE). The method stands on the weighted finite‐elements based approach. and the local solutions are represented by cubic Hermite polynomials. The weighting function is the gradient of residuals with respect to time derivatives of the solution at the nodes and nodal velocities. The general PBE considered includes nucleation. growth. aggregation and breakage terms. The accuracy of the moving finite elements method (MFEM) is evaluated by comparing the results to the analytical solution in problems involving combinations of the first three phenomena considered. The formulation addressed was successful when used for solving a two‐ phase system representing a semibatch precipitation reactor. The MFEM enables one to achieve accurate results at reasonable CPU times. thus. showing to be …,True,iAXRSzcAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,5,https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aic.11384,14625823486469634807,/scholar?cites=14625823486469634807,,https://estudogeral.uc.pt/bitstream/10316/8175/1/obra.pdf,0,0,0
1172459,A neuro-fuzzy system for modelling of a bleaching plant,1998,RP Paiva and A Dourado and B Duarte,3,Proceedings of the European Congress on Fuzzy and Intelligent Technologies-EUFIT’98,,1539-1543,,In paper industry. pulp bleaching is a most important concern in order to effectively respond to the high quality standards demanded by market requirements. Thus. a good knowledge of the bleaching plant is vital to achieve those goals. In this paper a neuro-fuzzy strategy is proposed to aid bleaching quality by predicting the outlet brightness. It consists of two phases: in the first one. a fuzzy clustering technique is applied to extract a set of fuzzy rules; in the second one. the centres and widths of the membership functions are tuned by means of a fuzzy neural network trained with backpropagation. This technique seems promising since it permits good results with large nonlinear plants. Furthermore. it describes the plant using a set of linguistic rules. which have the advantage of being closer to natural human language. so. more intuitive for operators. Preliminary promising results are presented and discussed.,True,iAXRSzcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,5,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.33.3992&rep=rep1&type=pdf,11846805354577666277,/scholar?cites=11846805354577666277,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.33.3992&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

T) phase diagram of sulfur have been assessed through empirical equations commonly used. This treatment shows insufficiencies. namely those leading to significant uncertainties in the coordinates of the low-pressure triple points. An alternative way to try and find reliable equations for the phase equilibrium curves is provided by the exact integration of Clapeyron equation established and developed in a previous work. No fitting to (p. T) experimental data is then necessary. According to this method equations have been found to all the sulfur low-pressure equilibrium lines. and at the same time providing the enthalpies of transition between the phases as functions of temperature. and reliable values for the coordinates of the low-pressure triple points.

Among other evidence for a mechanism of evaporation at work on the ground. dry lakebeds have been discovered. Recent Cassini infrared observations of these empty lakes have revealed a surface composition poor in water ice compared to that of the surrounding terrains—suggesting the existence of organic evaporites deposits. The chemical composition of these possible evaporites is unknown. In this paper. we study evaporite composition using a model that treats both organic solids dissolution and solvent evaporation. Our results suggest the possibility of large abundances of butane and acetylene in the lake evaporites.

Results show that polymers of medium charge density are more adequate to be used as retention aids since lower drainage time and higher filler retention are obtained at short contact time and low flocculant dosage. The branched polymers exhibited better performance than the linear polymers: drainage performance is significantly improved because highly branched polymers produce small flocs with a more open structure.,True,Ok9CjroAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,50,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie801216t,16609127564946327456,/scholar?cites=16609127564946327456,,https://www.eq.uc.pt/~jafgas/Paper_13.pdf,0,0,0

The model considers simultaneously aggregation. breakage and flocs restructuring to describe the PCC flocculation by bridging mechanism. The maximum collision efficiency factor. a parameter related with the fragmentation rate and a time constant for flocs restructuring have been taken as fitting parameters. These fitting parameters are optimized to get the best fit between experimental data obtained by LDS in a previous study and the modelled results. The optimized parameters were correlated with flocculant concentration. flocs structure and polymer branching.

In this work. we determined the rheology of long- and short-fiber bleached kraft pulp suspensions by using a new rotational viscometer especially designed for their analysis. The experimental rheograms were adjusted to the Herschel-Bulkley model. We established the dependence of the rheological parameters on temperature. fiber length. and pulp consistency. to evaluate the relative influence of these factors and the corresponding interactions in the rheological parameters. In addition. we defined a mathematical model that enables the estimation of rheological parameters as a function of the different input factors. We validated this model with some preliminary experimental data.

Poor understanding of the suspensions’ flow dynamics means the industrial equipment design is usually conservative and frequently oversized. thus contributing to excessive energy consumption in the plants. Our study aim was to obtain additional knowledge about the dynamic behavior of industrial pulp suspensions in order to evaluate the relative importance of the factors that influence pressure drop. To obtain mathematical correlations to quantify pressure drop for the transport of pulp suspensions. we studied four different industrial pulp suspensions (recycled pulp. eucalypt bleached kraft pulp. pine unbleached kraft pulp. and eucalypt [90%] + pine [10%] bleached kraft pulp) in a pilot rig specially designed and built for the effect.

As xylose was the main monosaccharide Pichia stipitis was selected to produce bioethanol. Two methods were tested. with different alkalis. to reduce hydrolysates toxicity and adjust pH. A two-step method using Ca(OH)2 leads to better fermentation results. Acid hydrolysates promoted higher ethanol concentrations (12 g L−1) with high productivity and yield values (0.22 geth L−1h−1 and 0.48 geth/gxyl eqs). whilst auto-hydrolysates. even after a secondary hydrolysis. gave low ethanol concentrations (2–4 g L−1).

Ltd.,BACKGROUND: The process of chemical pulp bleaching is based for the most part in chlorine dioxide within elemental chlorine free (ECF) technologies. The use of greener alternatives such as bleaching with hydrogen peroxide (P stage) is not widely used owing to selectivity concerns related to transition metal‐catalyzed decomposition reactions. Even at the final stage where peroxide is recognized to boost brightness and improve the brightness stability of the bleached pulp. cellulose degradation often overcomes these advantages.

A caracterização química das pastas envolveu essencialmente a determinação do grau de deslenhificação (IK). da viscosidade intrínseca e do teor de pentosanas. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que o aumento da temperatura ou da carga alcalina provoca uma diminuição de todas as características avaliadas. o mesmo acontecendo quando se aumenta IS em simultâneo com AA.

D0(EOP)D1(EP)D2 and OQ(PO)DP. are compared with respect to the bulk content of lignin. carboxyl. hexeneuronic acids (HexA). and reducing groups after each bleaching stage. HexA groups contribute significantly to the total content of carboxyl groups. and their degradation during chlorine dioxide bleaching is reflected by a decrease of the carboxyl content. The higher degradation using an enhanced use of oxygenbased bleaching chemicals is associated with a higher fiber charge reduction. mainly due to xylan depletion. Additionally. the effect of process variables of a laboratory final hydrogen peroxide stage on the chemical composition of the fully bleached pulp (D0(EOP)D1P and OQ(PO)DP) is studied. The ability of final peroxide bleaching to raise the content of carboxyl groups is dependent on the operating conditions and pulp bleaching history. A balance between carbohydrate oxidation and dissolution of oxidized groups determines the effect on fiber charge. The effect of hydrogen peroxide stabilizers added into the final stage on the content of carboxyl groups is also reported.,True,VxOCIM8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,16,https://eg.uc.pt/handle/10316/14248,7557851523172806729,/scholar?cites=7557851523172806729,,https://eg.uc.pt/bitstream/10316/14248/1/ECF%20bleaching%20with%20a%20final%20hydrogen%20peroxide%20stage.pdf,0,0,0

One of the main research fields is their exploitation as solvents for liquid−liquid extractions. but although ILs cannot vaporize leading to air pollution. they present non-negligible miscibility with water that may be the cause of some environmental aquatic risks. It is thus important to know the mutual solubilities between ILs and water before their industrial applications.

Ternary phase diagrams. tie-lines. tie-line slopes. tie-line lengths. and critical points for the several systems (ionic liquid + water + K3PO4) were determined and reported at 298 K and atmospheric pressure. It is shown that the increase of the cation alkyl chain length enhances the formation of aqueous biphasic systems if alkyl chain lengths until the hexyl are considered.

The experimental data obtained showed extreme negative deviations to ideality causing large melting-temperature depressions (up to 300 K) that are characteristic for deep eutectic systems. The experimental data revealed that cross-interactions between quaternary ammonium salt and fatty acid increase with increasing alkyl chain length of the quaternary ammonium chloride and with increasing chain length of the carboxylic acid. The pronounced decrease of melting temperatures in these deep eutectic systems is mainly caused by strong hydrogen-bonding interactions. and thermodynamic modeling required an approach that takes hydrogen bonding into account.

Targeting their effectiveness. recent investigations have attempted to establish polarity scales capable of ranking ILs according to their chemical behaviours. However. some major drawbacks have been found since polarity scales only report relative ranks because they depend on the set of probe dyes used. and they are sensitive to measurement conditions. such as purity levels of the ILs and procedures employed.

Distinct pairs of PEG polymers and ionic liquids can induce phase separation in aqueous media when dissolved at appropriate concentrations. Phase diagrams have been determined for a large array of systems at 298. 308 and 323K. A comparison of the binodal curves allowed the analysis of the tunable structural features of the ionic liquid (ie. anionic nature. cationic core. cationic alkyl side chain length and functionalisation. and number of alkyl substituents in the cation) and the influence of the molecular weight of the PEG polymer on the ability of these solutes to induce an ABS. It was observed that contrary to typical ABS based on ionic liquids and inorganic salts. in which the phase behaviour is dominated by the formation of the hydration complexes of the ions. the interactions between the PEG polymers and ionic liquids control the phase demixing in the polymer-type ABS studied herein. It is shown that both the ionic liquids and PEG polymers can act as the salting-out species; that is. it is an occurrence that is dependent on the structural features of the ionic liquid. For the first time. PEG/ionic liquid ABS are reported and insight into the major interactions that govern the polymer/ionic liquid phase behaviour in aqueous media are provided.

Conventional photocatalytic tests showed an improved photo-oxidation in the presence of activated carbons. beyond the so-called synergistic effect reported in the literature for carbon/titania composites. A novel approach based on UV irradiation of carbons pre-loaded with phenol was used to demonstrate the anomalous photochemical response of carbon materials towards phenol degradation. Analysis of the catalytic reaction from a different standpoint (inside the carbonaceous matrix) demonstrated the catalytic activity of certain carbon materials for phenol photodegradation. without considering photolytic breakdown and adsorption kinetics.

1172663,LDL-cholesterol signaling induces breast cancer proliferation and invasion,2014,Catarina Rodrigues dos Santos and Germana Domingues and Inês Matias and João Matos and Isabel Fonseca and José Mendes de Almeida and Sérgio Dias,13,Lipids in health and disease,1,1-9,BioMed Central,Lipids and cholesterol in particular. have long been associated with breast cancer (BC) onset and progression. However. the causative effects of elevated lipid levels and breast cancer remain largely undisclosed and were the subject of the present study. We took advantage of well-established in vitro and in vivo models of cholesterol enrichment to exploit the mechanism involved in LDL-cholesterol favouring BC growth and invasiveness. We analyzed its effects in models that mimic different BC subtypes and stages. Our data show that LDL-cholesterol (but not HDL-cholesterol) promotes BC cells proliferation. migration and loss of adhesion. hallmarks of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In vivo studies modeling cholesterol levels showed that breast tumors are consistently larger and more proliferative in hypercholesterolemic mice. which also have more frequently lung metastases. Microarray analysis revealed an over expression of intermediates of Akt and ERK pathways suggesting a survival response induced by LDL. confirmed by WB analyses. Gene expression analysis also evidenced an activation of ErbB2 signaling pathway and decreased expression of adhesion molecules (cadherin-related family member3. CD226. Claudin 7 and Ocludin) in the cells exposed to LDL. Together. the present work shows novel mechanistic evidence that high LDL-cholesterol levels promote BC progression.

With the exception of the phosphonium-based IL. which behaves as an almost ideal solution. the other ionic liquids show strong positive deviations from ideality. resulting from non-favorable interactions between CH4 and the ILs. The results indicate that the non-ideality of the solution increases. and the solubility decreases. with the polarity of the ionic liquid. The effect of the ionic liquid polarity on the CO2/CH4 and H2S/CH4 selectivities is evaluated here. The ionic liquids studied here present the largest CO2/CH4 and H2S/CH4 selectivities ever reported.

We emphasize outlier detection. transformations to normality and the de tection of clusters and unsuspected influential subsets. We then quantify the effect of these departures from normality on procedures such as dis crimination and duster analysis. The normal distribution is central to our book because. subject to our exploration of departures. it provides useful models for many sets of data. However. the standard estimates of the parameters. especially the covari ance matrix of the observations. are highly sensitive to the presence of outliers. This is both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because. if we estimate the parameters with the outliers excluded. their effect is appre ciable and apparent if we then include them for estimation.

The in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for 10 selected aerobic heterotrophic bacterial species. The antimicrobial activity of distinct concentrations of the essential oil based on the highest MIC value was tested in a food system comprising fresh sausage. Batch food samples were also inoculated with a fixed concentration of Escherichia coli and the time course of the product was evaluated with respect to the action of the different concentrations of essential oil.

Two different situations are considered. re-use and regeneration re-use for single contaminants. For re-use. three different methods of targeting are presented. one of them being simultaneously a design method.

Both discrete and continuous-time formulations. based on the general resource task network process (RTN) representation. are employed. For a given cycle time. the proposed discrete-time formulation results in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) program that can be solved to optimality in a reasonable time. even for a fine discretization of the time grid. The optimal cycle time is then determined by solving a sequence of fixed cycle time problems. On the other hand. the continuous-time formulation results in a mixed integer nonlinear (MINLP) problem that under the assumption of constant throughput becomes a MILP.

An algorithm that can be divided in two parts is proposed for finding global optimal solutions to the problem. The first part comprises a new linear program formulation that is used to generate good starting points for the solution of the general non-linear program (second part). Since the starting point is dependent on the treatment sequence. all possible treatment sequences are considered and thus multiple starting points are generated. The best solution of the several non-linear problems that are solved is then assumed to be the global optimal solution. although there is no theoretical guarantee that this is so.

Onset of column kinking agrees quantitatively with the Kruskal-Shafranov limit. and the kink acts as a dynamo which converts toroidal to poloidal flux.

Yamada et al.. Phys. Plasmas 4. 1936 (1997)]. Ion temperature in the layer rises substantially during null-helicity reconnection in which reconnecting field lines are anti-parallel. The plasma outflow is sub-Alfvénic due to a downstream back pressure. An ion energy balance calculation based on the data and including classical viscous heating indicates that ions are heated largely via nonclassical mechanisms. The Ti rise is much smaller during co-helicity reconnection in which field lines reconnect obliquely. This is consistent with a slower reconnection rate and a smaller resistivity enhancement over the Spitzer value.

The fusion burn fraction is linearly proportional to the confinement (or “dwell”) time of the liner-target system at peak compression. and therefore it is important to estimate the dwell time accurately in order to assess the fusion energy yield and gain. In this work. the dwell time has been estimated using the exact solution to a self-similar converging shock model. The dwell time was found to be determined by the sum of the outgoing shock and rarefaction times through the plasma liner at peak compression. and for chosen PLMIF conditions the dwell time was on the order of 1 μs.

The experiments are quite reproducible and involve a distinct sequence. Eight initial flux tubes. corresponding to eight gas injection locations. merge to form the jet. which lengthens. collimates. and eventually kinks. A model developed to explain the collimation process predicts that collimation is intimately related to convection and pile-up of frozen-in toroidal flux convected with the jet. The pile-up occurs when there is an axial non-uniformity in the jet velocity so that in the frame of the jet there appears to be a converging flow of plasma carrying frozen-in toroidal magnetic flux. The pile-up of convected flux at this “stagnation region” amplifies the toroidal magnetic field and increases the pinch force. thereby collimating the jet.,True,0V3IltIAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,42,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-4162-4_29,4964299554035581414,/scholar?cites=4964299554035581414,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.621.2691&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

These experiments were conducted in a collisional regime with very strong guide magnetic field (Bguide⪢Breconnection). which can be adjusted independently of plasma density. current density. and temperature. During initial coalescence. a reconnection current sheet forms between the two flux ropes. and the direction of the current is opposite to the flux rope currents.

The plasma jets are of either an argon/impurity or hydrogen/impurity mixture and are produced by pulsed-power-driven railguns. Based on time- and space-resolved fast-imaging. multi-chord interferometry. and survey-spectroscopy measurements of the overlapping region between the merging jets. we observe that the jets initially interpenetrate. consistent with calculated inter-jet ion collision lengths. which are long. As the jets interpenetrate. a rising mean-charge state causes a rapid decrease in the inter-jet ion collision length. Finally. the interaction becomes collisional and the jets stagnate. eventually producing structures consistent with collisional shocks.

To improve the overprediction of inertial deposition by a boundary treatment that adopts zero-gradient droplet wall velocity. we use a corrected wall velocity. based on an analytical solution of the droplet motion near the wall.

For realistic engineering applications. turbulence is often modeled in the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) framework where closure of the Reynolds stresses is mostly achieved using the turbulent viscosity formulation. It is a well-known problem that at large-scale interfaces between two phases such turbulence modeling breaks down as turbulent viscosity in the vicinity of an interface is over-predicted. To address this issue. we adopt the Egorov approach (Egorov et al.. 2014) which locally damps turbulence near the interface.

1172844,Towards direct numerical simulation of turbulent co-current Taylor bubble flow,2020,Edo Frederix and Jannes A Hopman and Traianos Karageorgiou and Ed MJ Komen,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.03866,,,,This paper present a simulation strategy for DNS of turbulent co-current Taylor bubble flow. This is a continuation of the work presented in [2] in which Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of co-current turbulent Taylor bubble flow was presented. It was observed that one of the main challenges is the physically accurate prediction of the behavior of the Taylor bubble skirt. and the related bubble shedding. An underestimation of the turbulent fluctuations in the wake of the Taylor bubble was observed in the LES results. It was suggested that this is related to over-prediction of the loss of void of the Taylor bubble due to bubble shedding induced by an LES mesh resolution which is not sufficient to capture the break-up and bubble formation accurately. To counter this. in the current work we present a DNS approach of co-current turbulent Taylor bubble flow called RK-Basilisk. based on the Basilisk code with local adaptive grid refinement. This strategy allows for very high mesh resolution near the bubble's interface while elsewhere the grid is allowed to be coarser. Each time step. the mesh is adapted based on a void fraction criterion. Basilisk's underlying data structure which is based on an'octree'allows for much faster solution procedures and. therefore. a much greater number of grid points as compared to the LES simulations which were performed using the more general OpenFOAM code. We compare the results against experimental data of the same setting. as well as the co-current LES OpenFOAM results.

This new method for implicit time stepping is an extension of the conservative symmetry-preserving incremental-pressure projection method for explicit time stepping and unstructured collocated meshes of Trias et al.(2014). In order to assess and compare both methods. we have implemented them within one unified solver in the open source code OpenFOAM. We combine both methods with a Butcher tableau for a family of explicit and diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta temporal schemes. We assess the energy conservation properties of the implemented discretisation methods and the temporal consistency of the selected Runge-Kutta schemes using Taylor-Green vortex and lid-driven cavity flow test cases.Although both implemented methods are based on a symmetry-preserving discretisation. we show that both methods still produce a small amount of numerical dissipation when the total pressure is directly solved from a Poisson equation. This numerical dissipation is mainly caused by the corresponding pressure error which is of . When an incremental-pressure approach is used. where a pressure correction is solved from a Poisson equation. the pressure error reduces to . yielding better conservation properties: both methods are then effectively fully-conservative. Furthermore. we conclude that all selected explicit and implicit higher order temporal schemes suffer from a reduction of the temporal order to …,True,Vp_OJV8AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03931,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03931,0,0,0

A volume-averaged approach to simulating porous media is often used because of its practicality and computational efficiency. Derivation of the volume-averaged porous flow equations introduces additional porous resistance terms to the momentum equation. When discretized these porous resistance terms create a body force discontinuity at the porous-fluid interface. which may lead to spurious oscillations if not accounted for properly. A variety of numerical techniques has been proposed to solve this problem. but few of them have concentrated on collocated grids and segregated solvers. which have wide applications in academia and industry. In this work we discuss the source of the spurious oscillations. quantify their amplitude and apply interface treatments methods that successfully remove the oscillations. The interface treatment methods are tested in a variety of realistic scenarios. including the porous plug and Beaver-Joseph test cases and show excellent results. minimizing or entirely removing the spurious oscillations at the porous-fluid interface.,True,Vp_OJV8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/oscillation-free-methods-for-modeling-fluid-porous-interfaces-usi,,,,,0,0,0

To predict spatially varying statistical properties of such aerosols. eg. the size distribution of the droplets. these processes must be captured accurately. We model nucleation using classical nucleation theory. whereas the con-densational growth is captured with a molecular diffusivity model. The droplet size distribution is discretized using a sectional approach. in which droplets are charac-terized in terms of a number of fixed droplet size bins. Often. in such a formula-tion. the numerical time step restrictions arising from condensation and nucleation are more pronounced than those of the corresponding fluid flow. thereby signifi-cantly limiting the global time step size. We propose a moment-conserving method in which this limitation is avoided. by utilizing the analytical solutions of the spa-tially homogeneous nucleation-condensation subproblem. The method is validated against experimental and numerical data of a laminar flow diffusion chamber. and shows an excellent agreement while being restricted only by a flow-related time step criterion.,True,Vp_OJV8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/characteristics-based-sectional-modeling-of-aerosol-nucleation-co,,,,,0,0,0

We recently developed such a method in [1] and [2] to capture the formation and transport of aerosol. eg. in a doublemixing tee. The sectional model allows to describe the evolution of the size distribution. due to nucleation. condensation. evaporation. coagulation and break-up. without introducing an assumption on the shape of the distribution. The sectional method generally requires more degrees of freedom and correspondingly is computationally more expensive compared to classical moment-based methods in which the shape of the distribution is assumed a priori.We extend our sectional method to include droplet drift. diffusion and deposition. The drift velocity is based on the solution of the particle equation of motion. including Stokes drag and gravity. The diffusion velocity is based on the Stokes-Einstein diffusivity model. We apply a perfectly-absorbing boundary condition for diffusional deposition. and a first-order extrapolation to the wall for convective deposition.

1172853,Large-eddy simulation of the turbulent mixing layer,1997,Bert Vreman and Bernard Geurts and Hans Kuerten,339,Journal of fluid mechanics,,357-390,Cambridge University Press,Six subgrid models for the turbulent stress tensor are tested by conducting large-eddy simulations (LES) of the weakly compressible temporal mixing layer: the Smagorinsky. similarity. gradient. dynamic eddy-viscosity. dynamic mixed and dynamic Clark models. The last three models are variations of the first three models using the dynamic approach. Two sets of simulations are performed in order to assess the quality of the six models. The LES results corresponding to the first set are compared with filtered results obtained from a direct numerical simulation (DNS). It appears that the dynamic models lead to more accurate results than the non-dynamic models tested. An adequate mechanism to dissipate energy from resolved to subgrid scales is essential. The dynamic models have this property. but the Smagorinsky model is too dissipative during transition. whereas the similarity and gradient models are not sufficiently dissipative for the smallest resolved scales. In this set of simulations. at moderate Reynolds number. the dynamic mixed and Clark models are found to be slightly more accurate than the dynamic eddy-viscosity model. The second set of LES concerns the mixing layer at a considerably higher Reynolds number and in a larger computational domain. An accurate DNS for this mixing layer can currently not be performed. thus in this case the LES are tested by investigating whether they resemble a self-similar turbulent flow. It is found that the dynamic models generate better results than the non-dynamic models.

Realizability conditions for the components of this tensor are derived. which hold if and only if the filter function is positive. The spectral cut-off. one of the filters frequently used in large-eddy simulation. is not positive. Consequently. the turbulent stress tensor based on spectrally filtered fields does not satisfy the realizability conditions. which leads to negative values of the generalized turbulent kinetic energy k. Positive filters. eg Gaussian or top-hat. always give rise to a positive k. For this reason. subgrid models which require positive values for k should be used in conjunction with eg the Gaussian or top-hat filter rather than with the spectral cutoff filter. If the turbulent stress tensor satisfies the realizability conditions. it is natural to require that the subgrid model for this tensor also satisfies these conditions. With respect to this point of view several subgrid models are discussed. For eddy-viscosity models a lower bound for the generalized turbulent kinetic energy follows as a necessary condition.

We apply this to large-eddy simulation of homogeneous isotropic decaying turbulence using a Smagorinsky subgrid model and investigate the combined effect of discretization and model errors at coarse subgrid resolutions. We compare four different central finite-volume methods. These discretization methods arise from the four possible combinations that can be made with a second-order and a fourth-order central scheme for either the convective and the viscous fluxes. By systematically varying the simulation resolution and the Smagorinsky coefficient. we determine parameter regions for which a desired number of flow properties is simultaneously predicted with approximately minimal error. We include both physics-based and mathematics-based error definitions. leading to different error-measures …,True,CcQ48twAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,92,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999107003257,2990628717248436157,/scholar?cites=2990628717248436157,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45701061/j.jcp.2007.07.01220160517-17972-1s8d2gk.pdf,0,0,0
1172868,Breakdown of large-scale circulation in turbulent rotating convection,2008,RPJ Kunnen and HJH Clercx and Bernardus J Geurts,84,EPL (Europhysics Letters),2,24001,IOP Publishing,Turbulent rotating convection in a cylinder is investigated both numerically and experimentally at Rayleigh number Ra= 10 9 and Prandtl number σ= 6.4. In this letter we discuss two topics: the breakdown under rotation of the domain-filling large-scale circulation (LSC) typical for confined convection. and the convective heat transfer through the fluid layer. expressed by the Nusselt number. The presence of the LSC is addressed for several rotation rates. For Rossby numbers Ro lesssim 1.2 no LSC is found (the Rossby number indicates relative importance of buoyancy over rotation. hence small Ro indicates strong rotation). For larger Rossby numbers a precession of the LSC in anticyclonic direction (counter to the background rotation) is observed. It is shown that the heat transfer has a maximal value close to Ro= 0.18 being about 15% larger than in the non-rotating case Ro=∞. Since the LSC is no longer present at …,True,CcQ48twAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,85,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/84/24001/meta,4597506131320595260,/scholar?cites=4597506131320595260,,https://research.utwente.nl/files/6545360/epl_lscrot.pdf,0,0,0

We demonstrate the application to the simulation of compressible flat plate flow instabilities. We compare second and fourth order accurate spatial discretization schemes in combination with explicit multistage time stepping for the simulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. We consider Mach numbers 0.5 and 4.5. In the vicinity of the outflow boundary. an efficient buffer domain treatment is introduced. which is suitable in conjunction with an explicit time integration scheme. This treatment requires only a short buffer domain to damp wave reflections at the outflow boundary.

We wish to add to the ongoing discussion in the literature whether temperature acts as an active or passive scalar in turbulent convection. with consequences for structure-function scaling. The simulation results show direct confirmation of the scalings derived by Bolgiano and Obukhov for turbulence with an active scalar for both velocity and temperature statistics. The active-scalar range shifts to larger scales when the forcing parameter (Rayleigh number) is increased. Furthermore. a close inspection of local turbulent length scales (Kolmogorov and Bolgiano lengths) confirms conjectures from earlier studies that the oft-used global averages are not suited for the interpretation of structure functions.

1172871,Quality and reliability of large-eddy simulations,2008,Johan Meyers and Bernard Geurts and Pierre Sagaut,12,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Computational resources have developed to the level that. for the first time. it is becoming possible to apply large-eddy simulation (LES) to turbulent flow problems of realistic complexity. Many examples can be found in technology and in a variety of natural flows. This puts issues related to assessing. assuring. and predicting the quality of LES into the spotlight. Several LES studies have been published in the past. demonstrating a high level of accuracy with which turbulent flow predictions can be attained. without having to resort to the excessive requirements on computational resources imposed by direct numerical simulations. However. the setup and use of turbulent flow simulations requires a profound knowledge of fluid mechanics. numerical techniques. and the application under consideration. The susceptibility of large-eddy simulations to errors in modelling. in numerics. and in the treatment of boundary conditions. can be quite large due to nonlinear accumulation of different contributions over time. leading to an intricate and unpredictable situation. A full understanding of the interacting error dynamics in large-eddy simulations is still lacking. To ensure the reliability of large-eddy simulations for a wide range of industrial users. the development of clear standards for the evaluation. prediction. and control of simulation errors in LES is summoned. The workshop on Quality and Reliability of Large-Eddy Simulations. held October 22-24. 2007 in Leuven.

1172872,Heat flux intensification by vortical flow localization in rotating convection,2006,RPJ Kunnen and HJH Clercx and BJ Geurts,74,Physical Review E,5,056306,American Physical Society,The effect of rotation on turbulent convective flow between parallel plates has been assessed with direct numerical simulations. With increasing rotation-rate an interesting transition is observed in the vertical-velocity skewness. This transition indicates a localization of motion directed away from the wall and correlates well with changes observed in the heat flux. as well as in the thermal and viscous boundary layer thicknesses. The formation of localized intense vortical structures provides for intensified vertical heat transport through Ekman pumping. At higher rotation-rates this is counteracted by the inhibition of vertical motion by rotation as expressed in the geostrophic thermal-wind balance.,True,CcQ48twAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,74,https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.056306,3330693366652825377,/scholar?cites=3330693366652825377,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/21d8/290b29bc8fe0bcb89b1f0a62b94f2973d395.pdf,0,0,0

The boundary integral formulation for Stokes flow is used and the non-Newtonian stress is treated as a source term which yields an extra integral over the domain of the drop. The implementation of the boundary conditions is facilitated by rewriting the domain integral by means of the Gauss divergence theorem. To apply the divergence theorem smoothness assumptions are made concerning the non-Newtonian stress tensor. The correctness of these assumptions in actual simulations is checked with a numerical validation procedure. The method appears mathematically correct and the numerical algorithm is second order accurate. Besides this validation we present simulation results for a Newtonian drop and a drop consisting of an Oldroyd-B fluid …,True,CcQ48twAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,69,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377025795013863,13616922399531756861,/scholar?cites=13616922399531756861,,,0,0,0

The simulations employ a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian computational model in which the momentum and energy transfer between the discrete particles and the continuous fluid phase are fully taken into account. The effect of turbophoresis. resulting in an increased particle concentration near a solid wall due to the inhomogeneity of the wall-normal velocity fluctuations. is shown to be responsible for an increase in heat transfer. As a result of turbophoresis. the effective macroscopic transport properties in the region near the walls differ from those in the bulk of the flow.

The error-landscape approach is extended to heterogeneous compressible turbulence. which is coupled to combustion as described by a flamelet model. The Smagorinsky model formulation is used to model the unknown turbulent stresses. We introduce several measures to quantify the total simulation error and observe a striking ‘valley-structure’ in the error that arises as function of the spatial resolution and the Smagorinsky length parameter.

Exact defiltering of a class of numerical realizations of the top-hat filter is developed. The approach is applied to large-eddy simulation of the temporal mixing layer. Smagorinsky’s model is adopted as base model and the results are compared to the standard dynamic eddy-viscosity model as well as to filtered DNS (direct numerical simulation) results. The difference between the results of the two models for the present application is found to be quite small. This is explained by performing a sensitivity analysis with respect to the dynamic coefficient. which hints towards a “self-restoring” response underlying the observed robustness of the physical predictions.

1172878,Commutator errors in the filtering approach to large-eddy simulation,2005,Fedderik van der Bos and Bernard J Geurts,17,Physics of Fluids,3,035108,American Institute of Physics,We analyze the large-eddy equations that are obtained from the application of a spatially nonuniform filter to the Navier–Stokes equations. Next to the well-known turbulent stress tensor a second group of subgrid terms arises; the so-called commutator errors. These additional subgrid terms emerge in the large-eddy equations solely as a consequence of the nonuniformity of the filter. We compare the magnitude of the divergence of the turbulent stress tensor with that of the commutator errors and pay attention to the role of the explicit filter that is adopted. It is shown that the turbulent stress contributions and the commutator errors display the same scaling behavior on the filter width and its derivative. Correspondingly. the use of higher-order filters is shown not only to decrease the commutator errors but likewise the turbulent stresses are uniformly reduced with increasing filter order.
