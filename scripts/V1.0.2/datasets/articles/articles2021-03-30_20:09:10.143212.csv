Ushie,,India Journal of Physics,,,Springer,In this study. we obtain an approximate solution of the Schrödinger equation in arbitrary dimensions for the generalized shifted Hulthén potential model within the framework of the Nikiforov–Uvarov method. The bound state energy eigenvalues were computed. and the corresponding eigenfunction was also obtained. It is found that the numerical eigenvalues were in good agreement for all three approximations scheme used. Special cases were considered when the potential parameters were altered. resulting in Hulthén potential and Woods–Saxon Potential. respectively. Their energy eigenvalues expressions agreed with the already existing literature. A straightforward extension to the s-wave case for Hulthén potential and Woods–Saxon potential cases is also presented. ,True,lsEyh3wAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,10,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12648-019-01650-0.pdf,8684946334998264207,/scholar?cites=8684946334998264207,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07552,0,0,0

The greater concern among the public is principally over the proximity of mobile base stations (MBS) to residential areas rather than the use of handsets. In this paper. we present an assessment of Radio-Frequency (RF) radiation exposure level measurements and analysis of radiation power density (in W/sq m) from mobile base stations relative to radial distance (in metre). The minimum average power density from individual base station in the town was about 47uW/sq m while the average maximum was about 1.5 mW/sq m. Our result showed that average power density of a base station decreased with increase in distance (away from base station) and that radiation intensity varies from one base station to another even at the same distance away. Our result (obtained signature of power density variation from data) was also compared the with an'expected'signature. It was found that radiation from external sources (indicative) interfered with the reference base station and accounted for the deviation observed in this study.

The radiation dose received by patients from medical X-ray examinations in Nigeria has shown large variations within and among diagnostic centers for similar examinations. This could be traced to lack of imaging protocols and availability of local or national diagnostic reference levels. The purpose of this study is to use film densitometry to estimate radiation absorbed dose to patients undergoing chest X-ray examination in the hospitals where this study was carried out. in order to determine their levels of exposure and compare with internationally recommended limits.

A Lee’s disc apparatus was used to determine the thermal conductivity of the various samples (Loamy Soil. loamy soil+ Urea. Loamy Soil+ Cow dung. Loamy Soil+ Poultry dung and Loamy Soil+ NPK). The results reveal that at no moisture content (after heating). loamy soil sample without additive has a thermal conductivity of 0.096 W/m K and also thermal conductivity values varied with addition of Cow dung (0.135 W/m K). poultry dung (0.231 W/m K). urea (0.140 W/m K) and NPK (0.108 W/m K). It clearly shows that the thermal conductivity of loamy soil increases with additives. It was also observed that loamy soil mixed with fertilizer produced a thermal conductivity higher than loamy soil mixed with organic manure. Therefore farmers are advised to always dope soil in their farmland with (organic or inorganic manure). this will improve yield. since plants growth are influenced by the microclimate which is influenced by thermal properties of soils.,True,lsEyh3wAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,2,https://www.journalajopacs.com/index.php/AJOPACS/article/view/22720,4785150595752073894,/scholar?cites=4785150595752073894,,https://www.journalajopacs.com/index.php/AJOPACS/article/download/22720/42317,0,0,0

While 67.9 Klux of solar radiation. 15.1 x10-1 A of current. and 7.5 V of recorded 65.9% of power efficiency in Port–Harcourt. This result shows that solar panel power efficiency is better in Uyo compare to Port-Harcourt.,True,lsEyh3wAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nneoyi_EGbe/publication/284456883_Comparative_Study_of_Solar_Radiation_Availability_As_It_Affects_Solar_Panel_Power_Efficiency_in_Uyo_and_Port-Harcourt_Nigeria/links/56f31a6c08ae7c1fda2847ce/Comparative-Study-of-Solar-Radiation-Availability-As-It-Affects-Solar-Panel-Power-Efficiency-in-Uyo-and-Port-Harcourt-Nigeria.pdf,10364852071761921007,/scholar?cites=10364852071761921007,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nneoyi_EGbe/publication/284456883_Comparative_Study_of_Solar_Radiation_Availability_As_It_Affects_Solar_Panel_Power_Efficiency_in_Uyo_and_Port-Harcourt_Nigeria/links/56f31a6c08ae7c1fda2847ce/Comparative-Study-of-Solar-Radiation-Availability-As-It-Affects-Solar-Panel-Power-Efficiency-in-Uyo-and-Port-Harcourt-Nigeria.pdf,0,0,0
