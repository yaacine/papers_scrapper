1324346,Phenomenological continuous contact–impact modelling for multibody simulations of pedestrian–vehicle contact interactions based on experimental data,2009,Robert WG Anderson and Alexandra D Long and Thierry Serre,58,Nonlinear Dynamics,1-2,199,Springer Netherlands,Multibody modelling of pedestrian collisions requires the definition of contact–impact between the pedestrian and the vehicle. An examination of relevant impact test data reveals large rate-dependent components of the reaction force. permanent indentation. and concomitant energy loss. Contact–impact models previously used in simulations of pedestrian impacts typically have not adequately modelled one. two or all three of these phenomena. This paper presents a phenomenological contact–impact model based on the Hunt–Crossley model of impact. which includes rate-dependent damping. and is extended to include permanent indentation. The proposed model suitably characterises impact test data in a form that can also be implemented in the multibody simulation code MADYMO (TASS-Safe. Netherlands). The proposed contact–impact model was used to characterise the impact between a legform …,True,ZVI7KQgAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,38,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-009-9471-6,10523469187972261065,/scholar?cites=10523469187972261065,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00506355/file/ts_NLD_2009_58_p.pdf,0,0,0
1324347,Rear end crashes,2005,Matthew Robert Justin Baldock and Alexandra Denise Long and Vicki Lee Ann Lindsay and Jack McLean,,,,,Centre for Automotive Safety Research,Due to the common occurrence of rear end collisions in South Australia. and the costliness of Compulsory Third Party (CTP) claims associated with them. a study was undertaken into the nature of. and possible countermeasures for. rear end collisions. This study included an analysis of five years of police-reported crash data. an analysis of a sample of rear end crashes investigated as part of the CASR metropolitan in-depth crash study. and a literature review concerned with countermeasures for rear end crashes. The most common factors contributing to these types of crashes are the lack of protection for right turning vehicles and the inadequate allocation of attention by drivers to the driving task. Countermeasures are available for both of these contributing factors. Providing greater protection for right turning vehicles requires road-based countermeasures. while the most promising countermeasure for inadequate allocation of attention is the installation in vehicles of collision avoidance systems. However. the latter countermeasure will only be available after further testing and refinement of current prototype systems.,True,ZVI7KQgAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,33,https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/36417,6458448704648162116,/scholar?cites=6458448704648162116,,,https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/36417/1/CASR018.pdf,0,0,0

1324349,Reduction of speed limit from 110 km/h to 100 km/h on certain roads in South Australia: a preliminary evaluation,2006,Alexandra Denise Long and Craig Norman Kloeden and Paul Hutchinson and Jack McLean,,,,,Centre for Automotive Safety Research,In July 2003. the speed limit on approximately 1.100 km of rural arterial roads in South Australia was reduced from 110 km/h to 100 km/h. The crash experience on these roads in the two years before and the two years following the change has been compared with that on other roads where the 100 km/h limit was not changed. It appears that the speed limit reduction has had the effect of reducing casualty crashes by 20 per cent. However. the number of crashes on these roads is small and the time since the change is so short that this estimate is uncertain. It is reasonable to think that in the longer term the change might be anywhere between an increase of 4 per cent and a decrease of 44 per cent. There was a decrease in crashes and casualties on the 100 km/h roads where the speed limit did not change and that has been allowed for in the calculations. At six sites. speed measurements before and after the speed limit reduction were available: an average speed reduction of 2 km/h was found,True,ZVI7KQgAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,15,https://hekyll.services.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/36422,18292498003358230909,/scholar?cites=18292498003358230909,,,https://hekyll.services.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/36422/1/CASR024.pdf,0,0,0

The factors considered in this paper include site and events. characteristics of the cyclist. characteristics of the motor vehicle and its driver. trends over the period 1981-2004. and injury severity. Some of these are frequently tabulated. and so particular attention is given to the site of the crash and characteristics of the motor vehicle and its driver. Findings include the following. Concerning trends. in 1981-1984. those aged 15 and younger made up 45 per cent of bicyclist casualties. In 2001-2004. this proportion had fallen to 16 per cent. Child pedal cyclist casualties reached a maximum in 1982-1987. and have fallen sharply since. from 317 in 1985 to 64 in 2004. Concerning injury severity. vehicles other than cars were involved in the case of 23 per cent of serious casualties. as compared with 18 per cent of total casualties.

With this comes the ever-present risk of oil supply shortages. But Australia is gas-rich and oil-poor. so it makes practical sense to assess how our own gas resources can be used to produce these fuels. Natural gas can be used directly as a fuel. blended with diesel in modified diesel engines. and converted into a conventional liquid fuel--all at a modest cost. This book. written by Australia's leading experts in the field. demonstrates how using natural gas as a transport fuel could increase fuel self-sufficiency to 50-70 percent by 2030.

Unlike other parts of the vehicle. the windscreen may crack as well as bend during an impact. The purpose of this study is to analyse the behaviour of a head impact on a windscreen and to design a multibody contact model of windscreen impact which accounts for rate-dependent damping effects. Subsystem impact tests were used to define contact-impact characteristics that correctly account for damping. Two phases can be distinguished in these characteristics. The first part corresponds to the bending and the fracture of the windscreen whereas the second part corresponds to the bending of the windscreen once it is broken. The characteristics were then implemented in a multibody model and the subsystem impact tests were simulated in order …,True,ZVI7KQgAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://hekyll.services.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/64641,,,,,,0,0,0

1324398,International trade in services and services co-production: An investigation into the nature of services and their political economy consequences on international trade.,2010,Lior Herman,,,,,,Goods and services are bundled together in economic analysis. which largely considers them to be similar despite contrary empirical evidence. Services have been largely absent from international political economy literature. so current explanations of international trade in services liberalisation and integration leave a lot to be desired. Using the WTO framework of the four modes of service supply. this thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of international trade in both healthcare and accountancy services. This empirical investigation sheds light on services' patterns of internationalisation and the relationships between different modes of trade. It finds that services differing from each other in many aspects are nevertheless intemationahsing following similar patterns and particularly through commercial presence. The empirical findings of this study are supported by an enquiry into the nature of services. They form the basis of the development of the theory of services coproduction. whereby the services output is jointly created by producers and consumers and/ or goods under their control. Co-production creates an inherent proximity constraint between producers and consumers. which is explained through the Services Production Trap (SPT). Co-production and the SPT have significant consequences for international political economy. Examination of firms' response to the SPT shows that accountancy firms developed a particular organisational model based on a network of partnerships that has been highly successful for internationalisation.

By examining historical intergovernmental joint development agreements (JDAs). it argues that the prospects for significant hydrocarbon cooperation are slim under current political conditions. as rival states rarely establish such accords. Moreover. creating JDAs is insufficient to prompt actual co-development of shared oil and gas deposits or improvements in states’ broader relations.

1324412,Disconnecting Climate Change from Conflict,2015,Emily Meierding,,,,52,Routledge,In April 2014. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim asserted that “Fights over water and food are going to be the most significant direct impacts of climate change in the next five to ten years. There’s just no question about it’(quoted in Elliott 2014). Such dire predictions have become commonplace among policy-makers. They are also articulated by climate change mitigation advocates who attempt to use the threat of climate conflicts to mobilize political action. A number of widely reported academic studies have also identified linkages between climate change and intrastate armed conflict. Yet most academic research on climate conflicts has produced ambiguous or negative results. Contrary to statements like Kim’s. there is no robust evidence that climate change is linked. directly or indirectly. to violent contention. Most scholars have responded to these analytical ambiguities by calling for more climate conflict research. Underpinning this proposal is a belief that further methodological refinements. aimed at bringing statistical models closer to theorized climate conflict connections. will produce more consistent and reliable empirical findings. This assumption has some merit; the methods employed in quantitative climate conflict research have improved significantly over the last few years and additional advances could enhance our understanding of the connections between climate change and intra-state conflict. However. maintaining the current research agenda also comes at a cost. Basic methodological fixes will not address the normative problems that arise from researchers’ current framing of climate conflicts. Consequently. in this chapter.

Most analyses of international energy geopolitics examine the interests and behaviour of powerful energy-importing countries like the US and China. This chapter begins by examining foreign powers’ expanded exploitation of oil and uranium resources in Sub-Saharan Africa. It goes on to examine how energy importers’ efforts to enhance their energy security through Africa are impacting energy security within Africa. It assesses Sub-Saharan states’ attempts to increase consumption of local oil and uranium reserves. Observing the constraints on these efforts. it then outlines some alternative strategies that have been employed to enhance African energy security. It concludes that. while local community-based development projects have improved the well-being of many households. they are not a sufficient guarantor of energy security.

London,Meierding challenges the popular belief that countries fight over oil resources by demonstrating that most militarized incidents in petroleum-endowed territories are merely ‘oil spats’: mild. brief. and non-lethal confrontations. Countries have only launched major military campaigns. targeting oil fields. on three occasions: Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait (1990). Japan’s invasion of the Dutch East Indies (1941–42). and Germany’s attacks against the Russian Caucasus (1941–42). These conflicts were not intensified oil spats. Instead. countries were fighting for survival; leaders believed that. if they failed to gain control over more oil. their regimes would collapse.

1324418,Environmental scarcity and conflict: Is there a connection,2008,Christopher Haid and Emily Meierding and Steven Wilkinson,,"Center for International Studies, University of Chicago",,,,More than fifteen years after scholars first started doing serious research on the link between environmental scarcity and conflict. we still have very little in the way of cumulative findings on the topic. A combination of poor data. inappropriate statistical models and inadequate general models of conflict within which environmental variables can be integrated are all factors in explaining why previous research efforts—such as the State Failure Task Force—were unable to demonstrate a connection between environmental scarcity and conflict.This project takes advantage of the availability of improved indicators of environmental change over the past decade as well as recent improvements in models of conflict (Fearon & Laitin 2003; Sambanis. 2004) in order to reexamine the relationship between environmental scarcity and conflict. The paper is divided into three parts: 1) an introductory section that summarizes the ‘state of the art’on research on environmental change and conflict; 2) a statistical analysis (using data from 1945-1999) in which we assess the extent to which key indicators of environmental change and scarcity are related to levels of conflict; and 3) several case studies of key countries in the Middle East and South Asia. in which we try to identify ways in which environmental indicators might be related (or not) with levels of conflict.,True,jWMXbjYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,http://jtac.uchicago.edu/products/jtac_2008_wilkinson.pdf,17964988749019966881,/scholar?cites=17964988749019966881,,,http://jtac.uchicago.edu/products/jtac_2008_wilkinson.pdf,0,0,0
1324419,The Oil Wars Myth: Petroleum and the Causes of International Conflict,2020,Emily Meierding,,,,,Cornell University Press,"Do countries fight wars for oil? Given the resource's exceptional military and economic importance. most people assume that states will do anything to obtain it. Challenging this conventional wisdom. The Oil Wars Myth reveals that countries do not launch major conflicts to acquire petroleum resources. Emily Meierding argues that the costs of foreign invasion. territorial occupation. international retaliation. and damage to oil company relations deter even the most powerful countries from initiating"" classic oil wars."" Examining a century of interstate violence. she demonstrates that. at most. countries have engaged in mild sparring to advance their petroleum ambitions. The Oil Wars Myth elaborates on these findings by reassessing the presumed oil motives for many of the twentieth century's most prominent international conflicts: World War II. the two American Gulf wars. the Iran–Iraq War. the Falklands/Malvinas War. and the Chaco War. These case studies show that countries have consistently refrained from fighting for oil. Meierding also explains why oil war assumptions are so common. despite the lack of supporting evidence. Since classic oil wars exist at the intersection of need and greed—two popular explanations for resource grabs—they are unusually easy to believe in. The Oil Wars Myth will engage and inform anyone interested in oil. war. and the narratives that connect them.",True,jWMXbjYAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8224585892578549820&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

1324422,The Geopolitics of Cheap Oil,2017,Emily Meierding,,,,,,In the late 2000s. oil prices seemed poised for a permanent increase. Commentators lamented the end of “cheap oil” and predicted intensifying competition over the world’s dwindling petroleum supplies. However. when oil prices crashed at the end of 2014. the international energy landscape changed dramatically. Suddenly. oil-exporting and importing countries were faced with an oil glut. This talk explains why the price crash occurred and explores its geopolitical implications. In particular. it examines how oil-exporting countries are responding to their growing financial crises and how these responses could impact energy and political security in the United States.,True,jWMXbjYAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,0,https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/57766,,,,,,0,0,0
1324423,Joint development in the South China Sea,2017,Emily Meierding,,,ARTICLE,,,This article evaluates whether the South China Sea's littoral states can cooperatively manage the region's contested oil and natural gas resources. By examining historical intergovernmental joint development agreements (JDAs). it argues that the prospects for significant hydrocarbon cooperation are slim undercurrent political conditions. as rival states rarely establish such accords. Moreover. creating JDAs is insufficient to prompt actual co-development of shared oil and gas deposits or improvements in states' broader relations. Nonetheless. hydrocarbon agreements do have one important positive impact. They prevent resource-related militarized confrontations. thereby reducing the risk of territorial dispute escalation. This incentive. alone. could prompt the South China Sea's claimant states to negotiate JDAs and third party states to encourage these efforts.,True,jWMXbjYAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://repository.graduateinstitute.ch/record/294812/,,,,,,0,0,0

1324427,Uranium and Internal Conflict: A Question of Value,2012,Emily Meierding,,APSA 2012 Annual Meeting Paper,,,,This paper adds to the literature on natural resources and internal conflict by examining the relationships between uranium and intra-state armed contention. It observes that. due to uranium’s relatively low economic value and constraints on resource extraction and sales. many of the conventional causal mechanisms proposed to link natural resources and conflict are unlikely to apply to uranium. Nonetheless. an examination of the historical record reveals a number of cases in which uranium resources encouraged internal contention. Analysis of these cases demonstrates that the most common mechanism linking uranium to intra-state conflict is one that is generally overlooked in the resource–conflict literature: resource defense. The analysis also demonstrates that. to fully capture resource–conflict linkages. resource “value” must be measured as more than just an economic quality and should be evaluated in reference to all actors. including third party states and companies. not just rebels and the central government.,True,jWMXbjYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2106719,,,,,,0,0,0

Mapping by use of prophage deletions.,1975,DH Walker and JT Walker,16,Journal of virology,3,525-534,American Society for Microbiology Journals,One hundred and ten amber mutants of coliphage P1 were isolated and localized into groups with respect to the existing genetic map by use of nonpermissive Escherichia coli K-12 strains lysogenic for P1 with deletions. These lysogens contain one of three types of deletion prophages: P1cry and its derivatives. P1dlacs. and P1dpros. Fourteen such lysogens were tested for their ability to rescue the amber mutants which were then assigned to one of nine deletion segments of the P1 genome defined by the termini of the various prophage deletions. The relationship of the nine deletion segments with the published P1 map is described. two new segments having been added. The deletions of the 14 prophages overlapped sufficiently to indicate that the P1 genetic prophage map should be represented in circular form. which is consistent with the fact that P1 is normally a circular plasmid in the prophage state.

In this method. an electrostatic image is formed on a dielectric member by uni formly charging the dielectric member and then discharging selected areas of the uniform charge to yield an image-wise electrostatic charge pattern. Such discharge is typically accomplished by exposing the uniformly charged dielectric member to actinic radiation provided by selectively activating particular light sources in an LED array or a laser device directed at the dielectric member. After the image-wise charge pattern is formed. resin particles are given a charge.

As the volume of data grows exponentially. the management of these data becomes more complex in proportion. A key point is to handle the complexity of the data life cycle. i.e. the various operations performed on data: transfer. archiving. replication. deletion. etc. Indeed. data-intensive applications span over a large variety of devices and e-infrastructures which implies that many systems are involved in data management and processing.

Such policies impede the optimal allocation of resources from the infrastructure provider viewpoint. Over the last decade. more dynamic and often more efficient policies based. e.g.. on consolidation and load balancing techniques. have been developed. Due to the underlying complexity of cloud infrastructures. these policies are evaluated either using limited scale testbeds/in-vivo experiments or ad-hoc simulators. These validation methodologies are unsatisfactory for two important reasons: they (i) do not model precisely enough real production platforms (size. workload variations. failure. etc.) and (ii) do not enable the fair comparison of different approaches.

Particularly. we explore different ways of constructing a data-driven dynamic workflow and then evaluate the overheads introduced by such design decisions. We evaluate workflows with varying data size. percentage of interesting data. temporal data distribution. and number of tasks triggered. Finally. we provide advice based upon analysis of the evaluation results for users looking to construct data-driven scientific workflows.,True,wmGPuSgAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10381,2967676421037726082,/scholar?cites=2967676421037726082,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10381,0,0,0

Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is an essential component of these facilities. providing the user community with access to data. data products. and services with the potential to transform data into knowledge. However. the timely evolution of the CI available at large facilities is challenging and can result in science communities requirements not being fully satisfied. Furthermore. integrating CI across multiple facilities as part of a scientific workflow is hard. resulting in data silos.In this paper. we explore how science gateways can provide improved user experiences and services that may not be offered at large facility datacenters. Using a science gateway supported by the Science Gateway Community Institute. which provides subscription-based delivery of streamed data and data products from the NSF Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). we propose a system that enables streaming-based capabilities and workflows using data from large facilities. such as the OOI. in a scalable manner. We leverage data infrastructure building blocks. such as the Virtual Data Collaboratory. which provides data and computing capabilities in the continuum to efficiently and collaboratively integrate multiple data-centric CIs. build data-driven workflows. and connect large facilities data sources with NSF-funded CI. such as XSEDE.

1324475,ENOS: a Holistic Framework for Conducting Scientific Evaluations of OpenStack,2016,Ronan-Alexandre Cherrueau and Adrien Lebre and Dimitri Pertin and Anthony Simonet and Matthieu Simonin,,,,,,By massively adopting OpenStack for operating small to large private and public clouds. the industry has made it one of the largest running software project. Driven by an incredibly vibrant community. OpenStack has now overgrown the Linux kernel. However. with success comes an increased complexity; facing technical and scientific challenges. developers are in great difficulty when testing the impact of individual changes on the performance of such a large codebase. which will likely slow down the evolution of OpenStack. In the light of the difficulties the OpenStack community is facing. we claim that it is time for our scientific community to join the effort and get involved in the development and the evolution of OpenStack. as it has been once done for Linux. However. diving into complex software such as OpenStack is tedious: reliable tools are necessary to ease the efforts of our community and make science as collaborative as possible. In this spirit. we developed ENOS. an integrated framework that relies on container technologies for deploying and evaluating OpenStack on any testbed. ENOS allows researchers to easily express different configurations. enabling fine-grained investigations of OpenStack services. ENOS collects performance metrics at runtime and stores them for post-mortem analysis and sharing.

This method first identifies the viability of carbon capture technology in a given system using the concept of prioritised cost. It then allows for calculating the quantity of existing power plants to be retro-fitted. It also takes into account unique aspects of carbon capture technologies: parasitic loss associated with carbon capture units and variation in existing sources that come about with the introduction of a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) unit.

In general. Pinch Analysis is applied to single objective optimization problems. A characterizing parameter. called prioritized cost. has been developed to identify a cost optimal solution with multiple resources. In this work. Pinch Analysis is extended to address multi-objective Pinch Analysis problems with multiple resources. This is achieved by assigning a weighting factor to each objective and calculating the prioritized cost based on this variable. As the weighted prioritized cost is a linear function. it is possible to identify key values of the weighting factor where the order of priorities shifts. This greatly reduces the complexity of the problem and makes it possible to identify all the viable resource combinations. The plots of prioritized cost as a function of weighting factor can be obtained for any number of available resources. Using the prioritizing order given by these plots.

Universidad Nacional de Colombia.,The GERIPA project aimed at generating renewable energy integrated with food production has led to a beneficial option for producing ethanol and electricity. Ethanol has economic. social and environmental potential. Considering just the first one. Brazil consumes 39 billion litres per year-L D/yr of diesel oil. 18% of it being imported. The Federal Government has a recovery programme for the soybean agribusiness aimed at soybean biodiesel (SBD) production in which a 10% addition to diesel has been proposed. This 10% involves producing 10.7 million L SBD/d. Soybean biodiesel production is not self-sustainable and such proposal could require an annual subsidy of up to US $1.33 billion. Soybean plantations would need about 10 to 12 times more land than is necessary for sugarcane plantations to produce the same equivalent thermal energy (ETE). Sixtyseven GERIPA projects (GP) producing 80.000 litres of ethanol per day (GP80) could be set up with the sum of US $1.33 billion; this would substitute current Brazilian biodiesel demand by 4.28%. adding the same value for each new subsidiary. Considering ETE. ethanol-GP cost would be 37% to 50% below that for a litre of SBD on account of its raw material (RM) and region. The diesel cycle's thermal efficiency (η t) yield is around 50% and that of the Otto cycle engine η t is around 37%. The cost per km driven (CKD) by substituting SBD for ethanol-GP80 would thus indicate an 18% minimum and 59% maximum cost reduction for vehicle engines.,True,maGcJ8YAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,6,http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?pid=S0120-56092009000200012&script=sci_arttext&tlng=pt,5326264650519534757,/scholar?cites=5326264650519534757,,,http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?pid=S0120-56092009000200012&script=sci_arttext&tlng=pt,0,0,0

Previously reported water oxidation catalysts have limited activity and selectivity. imposing a bottleneck for broad adoption of this technology.

During the cardiac cycle. changes to vascular pressure induce a compliant response in the vessels as they cyclically stretch and relax. The compliance influences the fluid flow throughout the system. The interaction is influenced by the disease state of the artery. and in particular. a plaque layer can reduce the compliance. In order to properly quantify the fluid-structural response. it is essential to consider whether the tissue surrounding the artery provides a support to the vessel wall. Here. a series of calculations are provided to determine what role the supporting tissue plays in the vessel wall and how much tissue must be included to properly carry out future fluid-structure calculations.

The history of cardiovascular research is rich and although this study is not intended to be a review of the subject. a short summary related to the present work is necessary. Interested readers are invited to review articles such as [1-4]. These studies are representative of the literature which deal with the complexities of hemodynamics. Among the important subtopics are the relationship between the wall and the fluid. The fluid exerts a shear stress on the wall which is believed to be a causing of thickening of the wall and the initiation of cardiovascaular disease. The flow also has an impact on transport through the arterial wall [5-20].In addition to these hemodynamic-focused studies. it has been found that arterial compliance (the distension of an artery wall during the cardiac cycle) is an important indicator of disease progression. In particular. for a diseased artery. the stiffened arterial wall or the rigid plaque layer reduces the otherwise healthy-artery response to pressure fluctuations [21-22].

Just after the Revolution. women were granted numerous legal rights. The revolution weakened the institution of the family in Soviet system. but did not replace it with any other institution. Therefore. women and children became the greatest victims of change and transformation in Russia and countries under its influence. The Bolsheviks tried to change the life style of women in Central Asia. where they regarded as the castle of religious and traditional backwardness. At the beginning they implemented somehow soft politics to change the life style of women and traditional family. But when they could not achieve their target they started to follow aggressive policies towards women and family. The politics followed by the Bolsheviks towards women and family were perceived as politics of assimilation of the people of Muslim countries in the region. and therefore they attempted to protect their traditional values. In this period. the women of the region were under a double attack. They were under the pressure of Bolsheviks on the one hand. and were under the impact of traditional values. which subjugated women to the secondary status to men. on the other.

The research has been conducted over 2040 women working in 306 institutions taken equally from schools. hospitals and banks in 12 different cities determined according to the NUTS-1 classification system. The research data has been obtained through the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods used through investigation. Two basic questions have been tried to shed light over through the research. First. portray of women working in different positions in three institutions. Particularly the rate of women managers has been an important issue in this regard. Second. the problems women face in their worklife that has been originated from their familial life. business environment and social norms. The barriers and obstacles women encounter during their mobilization process is the basic question of this research in this respect. According to the results of the investigation there is a class ceiling syndrome in both three institutions. Even though women keep the majority of employees (over 50 percent in each institution) in different positions. their percentage drop to a range changing between 10-20 percents in managerial positions. In other words. a drastic decrease is seen in the percentage of women managers in education. health and financial sectors. Women face diverse obstacles and barriers during their mobilization process. While some of these barriers are observable and testable an important part of them are. indeed. unobservable and thus hidden.

Therefore. continuous efforts need to be done to improve the cells efficiency by controlling their temperature. For this reason. in the present work. the possibility of adding a cooling system to existing photovoltaic units without changing the original module structure is investigated. The selected cooling methods use water to cool the module front side. To investigate the system behaviour. a steady-state and a PV dynamic model have been firstly developed. The steady-state thermal model is used to compute the module permanent regime temperature in relation to fixed and constant ambient conditions and cooling regime while the dynamic model is used to predict the time-response of the module thermal mass during the variation of external parameters.

CAES plants often operate on electricity spot markets by storing energy when prices are low and generating electricity when prices are high. This paper investigates the operation over a year of two different CAES plants in two different scenarios. The first scenario simulates the operation of a CAES plant as independent plant in the Italian electricity market with the aim of maximizing the earnings. The control method is based on the variation of the hourly price of energy and on the variation of the pressure of the air stored in the cavern. The second scenario simulates the operation of an integrated system built up of a CAES and a wind farm with the aim of maximizing the earnings of the integrated system and the capacity factor of the wind farm. The integration of CAES and the wind farm is considered by means of a non-direct connection. The spot markets prices are referred to the Italian market.

Cycling requirements in terms of fast start-up and number of start-ups per year have considerably increased in the last years. Therefore. nowadays cycling operation is fundamental to be competitive in the electricity market. especially for combined cycle power plants. For this reason a proper procedure is essential to predict the residual life of plant components and assist operators during the planning and production phase. The core of the proposed procedure is the plant dynamic model. The model is used to estimate the variation of thermodynamic parameters during transient condition and start-up/shut-down period. The power plant performances have been evaluated by considering the entire geometry of the heat exchangers and drums. Models are built including the main devices and the mass and energy flows among them and considering the control strategy and the effects of environmental conditions (which can also influence the load of devices). Steady-state and different transient conditions are investigated and the trends of the main thermodynamic parameters are computed.

Multi-modelling approaches facilitate improved understanding of the detailed technology pathways required to meet decarbonisation targets; however. to-date there has been limited attention on the policy roadmaps and enabling measures that might achieve these decarbonisation targets. This paper addresses this gap by developing a multi-model approach using an energy systems optimisation model. a sectoral simulation model together with scrutiny of individual policy measures to explore decarbonisation of the private car sector in the Irish transport system commensurate with an 80% reduction in national carbon emissions by 2050.

A particular emphasis has been given to battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). with many nations investing in improving their charging infrastructure and incentivising electric vehicle purchasing through offering grant schemes and tax relief to consumers. Despite these incentives. the uptake of BEVs and PHEVs has been low. while some countries. such as Ireland and Denmark. are in the process of removing the tax relief currently in place. This initial retraction has already been met with a fall in sales of BEVs and PHEVs. which is expected to continue decreasing as these incentives are further reduced.

Despite a large literature body analysing private car energy use. there has been very little published analysis on freight transport. which itself has largely been limited to one aspect of freight transport. namely heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). This paper focuses on the energy and related CO2 emissions associated with light goods vehicles (LGVs) in Ireland. which contributes to addressing the knowledge gap in freight transport energy use.

1324587,Techno-economic and socio-economic modelling of energy in road transport to inform climate policy,2017,Eamonn Mulholland,,,,,,The release of increasing amounts of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the corresponding global temperature rise has prompted a growing political consensus on a decarbonised future to prevent any sustained economic or environmental harm. Many countries are using modelling tools to develop strategies and policy measures to deliver timely and effective reductions of harmful greenhouse gas emissions across all energy related sectors. Techno-economic models have a track record in developing low carbon pathways from a technical standpoint. though they have generally failed to adequately account for the underlying socio-economic behaviour which drives consumers in their choices. This thesis highlights and addresses this failing in two parts with a focus on road transport. one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise. The first part of this thesis reviews the functionality of techno-economic road transportation models and identifies the limitations associated with their operation.

The largest contributor to Ireland’s energy-related GHG emissions. at 33%. is the transport sector. The transport sector thus has a vital role to play in the decarbonisation of the Irish energy system and subsequent protection of the climate system. Despite national efforts to curb transport emissions. the proportion of transport-related energy demand and. consequentially. GHG emissions. have increased consistently in the past 5 years.The continued rise in transport activity. energy consumption and emissions can be attributed to economic. technological and societal factors.

1324591,Quantifying the Economic Losses From Transport Demand Disruption Due to Climate Change,2019,Eamonn Mulholland and Elena Navajas-Cawood and Aris Christodoulou and Luc Feyen and Juan Carlos Ciscar-Martinez,,,,,,The increasing frequency and severity of weather events shaped by climate change are expected to have an escalating impact on the operation and. in turn. the generalised costs of the transportation system in the coming decades. This disruption will be caused by a plethora of both direct and indirect impacts of worsening climate measures on transport supply and demand. Direct impacts take the form of climate extremes which have an immediate impact on the ability of the transport network to serve demand. such as excessive rainfall reducing visibility and slowing travel speeds. infrastructure failures from excessively hot temperatures (eg. rail buckling) or river and coastal flooding preventing travel along certain critical routes. Indirect measures are a step removed from their direct counterparts and disrupt demand due to issues such as agricultural produce changing the origin of supply. or changes in tourist destinations resulting in a shift in transport demand. Focusing on transport supply. these types of weather events which render infrastructures unusable will induce added travel time through rerouting. thus increasing the cost of freight goods due to an additional cost to transport. and increasing the cost to passengers through additional fuel costs and lost time. There have been a number of studies projecting the effects of future adverse climate conditions on transportation infrastructure (Cochran 2009; Nemry and Demirel 2012; Schweikert.

Technological advancement is on the rise and with increasing policy support. studies present diverse approaches on evaluation of policy mix options to stimulate adoption of these technologies. Of interest to this paper is the agent-based modelling (ABM) approach. which is a methodology that integrates dynamics of behavioural decisions that are largely exhibited in several aspects of transport activities and the energy system. In this regard. we review ABM studies that investigate opportunities for alternative low carbon road transport technologies. In general. the literature shows a large presence of ABM application to transport related studies. with many finding opportunities for diffusion of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). However. most of the studies in literature neglect to explore the emissions savings implications. which is an important. as it provides a scale to compare emissions savings by fuel/vehicle technology type. while providing more convincing findings for transport policy makers through quantitative indicators. Studies that encompass ABM application to AFVs and its emissions implications are quite limited. A systematic literature search resulted in identification of only 7 relevant articles in this regard. Findings suggest research gaps in AFV-ABM studies with opportunity for a model that integrates emissions measure and savings.,True,x_BVIZkAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3702784,,,,,,0,0,0

Therefore. in developing countries. the access to modern conversion technologies would contribute to reduce the poverty. improve health services and promote the economy especially in rural areas. Around 2.5 billion people in these countries use biomass for cooking. However. major concerns are due to the unsustainable use of biomass and the inefficient conversion technologies employed in rural areas. Therefore. the use of locally available biomass in modern biomass conversion technologies would significantly reduce emissions and improve the energy efficiency.

Therefore. this article presents the performance analysis in terms of energy efficiency. economic feasibility. and environmental sustainability of a photovoltaic (PV)/Stirling battery system. The analysis includes the dynamic start-up and cooling phases of the system. and then compares its performance with a hybrid photovoltaic (PV)/diesel/battery system. whose configuration is usually more common. Both systems were initially optimized in size using the well-known energy optimization software tool. HOMER. An estimated demand for a hypothetical case study of electrification for a rural village of 102 households. called “Tacuaral de Mattos”. was also considered. However. since the characteristics of the proposed systems required a detailed analysis of its dynamics. a dynamic model that complemented the HOMER analysis was developed using MATLAB Simulink TM 8.9.

The sensor is based on a micromachined Fabry-Perot device (MFPD) that uses a thin film microcantilever beam as the top mirror and a silicon substrate as the bottom mirror of the optical microcavity. The major effect that the viscosity and density of the air surrounding the MFPD have on the viscous damping provides the mechanism for the detection of the pressure. A major advantage of this configuration is that there is no need for a sealed microcavity since the air is trapped by the viscous damping effects. The sensor has been tested up to 90 psi and pressure sensitivities of about 0·04%/psi with a MFPD sensor with a resonant frequency of about 46·7 kHz have been measured.,True,TjIKIoYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,4,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12046-009-0039-4.pdf,7058807514329251437,/scholar?cites=7058807514329251437,,,https://www.ias.ac.in/public/Volumes/sadh/034/04/0615-0623.pdf,0,0,0

This can be done by optimizing turbine layout as well as optimizing turbine yaw and pitch angles. In particular. wake steering by optimizing yaw angles of wind turbines in farms has received significant attention in recent years. One of the challenges in yaw optimization is developing fast optimization algorithms which can find good solutions in real-time. In this work. we developed a random search algorithm to optimize yaw angles. Optimization was performed on a layout of 39 turbines in a 2 km by 2 km domain. Algorithm specific parameters were tuned for highest solution quality and lowest computational cost. Testing showed that this algorithm can find near-optimal (< 1% of best known solutions) solutions consistently over multiple runs. and that quality solutions can be found under 200 iterations.

In the past 4 years. we have developed capabilities to improve the layout design of wind farms located on complex terrains. as contributions from four major tasks.  The outcome of the first task was the creation of a wake interaction model capable of describing the effects of overlapping wakes that can be used in combination with existing mathematical optimization tools for wind farm layout design. Such a model was derived and evaluated against existing wake interaction methods. This wake interaction model enables a mechanistic approach to account for multiple overlapping wakes while remaining compatible with established mathematical optimization methods.  In the second task. this wake interaction model was used in conjunction with full-scale CFD simulations to design wind farm layouts. We developed an optimization algorithm that intelligently integrates a mathematical optimization approach to design wind farm layout on complex terrains with full-scale CFD simulations.

Previous studies have shown this is possible. that by 2035 the economics of alternative powertrain and energy vectors will have converged. However. they do not address whether the transition is likely or plausible. Using the UK as a case study. we present a systems dynamics model based study informed by transition theory and explore the effects of technology progress. policy-making. user preferences and; for the first time. automated vehicles on this transition. We are not trying to predict the future but to highlight what is necessary in order for different scenarios to become more or less likely. Worryingly we show that current policies with the expected technology progress and expectations of vehicle buyers are insufficient to reach global targets. Faster technology progress. strong financial incentives or a change in vehicle buyer expectations are crucial but still insufficient. In contrast. the biggest switch to alternatively fuelled vehicles could be achieved by the introduction of automated vehicles.

1324628,A simple assessment of housing retrofit policies for the UK: what should succeed the energy company obligation?,2018,Luciana Maria Miu and Natalia Wisniewska and Christoph Mazur and Jeffrey Hardy and Adam Hawkes,11,Energies,8,2070,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Despite the need for large-scale retrofit of UK housing to meet emissions reduction targets. progress to date has been slow and domestic energy efficiency policies have struggled to accelerate housing retrofit processes. There is a need for housing retrofit policies that overcome key barriers within the retrofit sector while maintaining economic viability for customers. funding organizations. and effectively addressing UK emission reductions and fuel poverty targets. In this study. we use a simple assessment framework to assess three policies (the Variable Council Tax. the Variable Stamp Duty Land Tax. and Green Mortgage) proposed to replace the UK’s current major domestic retrofit programme known as the Energy Company Obligation (ECO). We show that the Variable Council Tax and Green Mortgage proposals have the greatest potential for overcoming the main barriers to retrofit policies while maintaining economic viability and contributing to high-level UK targets. We also show that. while none of the assessed schemes are capable of overcoming all retrofit barriers on their own. a mix of all three policies could address most barriers and provide key benefits such as wide coverage of property markets. operation on existing financial infrastructures. and application of a “carrot-and-stick” approach to incentivize retrofit. Lastly. we indicate that the specific support and protection of fuel-poor households cannot be achieved by a mix of these policies and a complementary scheme focused on fuel-poor households is required.

This means that the energy industry will have to adapt their business models in order to capture these pools of value. Recent work explores how changes to the utility business model that include digital. decentralised or service-based offers could both disrupt the market and accelerate low carbon transitions. However. it is unclear whether these business models are technologically feasible. To answer this question. we undertook an expert panel study to determine the readiness levels of key enabling technologies. The result is an analysis of what technologies may hinder electricity business model innovation and where more research or development is necessary. The study shows that none of the business models that are compatible with a low carbon power sector are facing technology barriers that cannot be overcome. but there is still work to be done in the domain of system integration. We conclude that. especially in the field of energy system coordination and operation. there is a need for comprehensive demonstration trials which can iteratively combine and test information and communications technology (ICT) solutions. This form of innovation support would require a new approach to energy system trials.

1324637,Assessing transition policies for the diffusion of electric vehicles,2015,Christoph Mazur,,,,,Imperial College London,Though hybrid. electric or fuel cell cars have the potential to lower carbon emissions in transport. they have not yet penetrated the market sufficiently. Policy makers want to solve that issue but have only limited insights on how to actually allocate their limited resources. To address this. research has started examining the transition of socio-technical systems and the roll-out of past technologies. This has led to the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework. which offers a basis to discuss sustainability transitions. transition patterns and pathways. Though it already has provided relevant insights for policy makers on how they can achieve their transition targets. the MLP currently only offers a qualitative framework that only focuses on a narrative understanding of transitions. Quantitative approaches. however. lack the insights from the MLP research strand. Hence. an appropriate mean to assess the effectiveness of policies or firm strategies with regard to future transition pathways is missing. This PhD addresses these shortcomings. creating links between transition science and modelling to allow the examination of sustainability transitions. The outputs help identify suitable policy measures to achieve desired transitions that are compatible with governments’ targets - hence to create (Mission-Oriented) Transition Policies that satisfy environmental and industrial targets.,True,E1Mh2bEAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC,3,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/27248,13564337913722498131,/scholar?cites=13564337913722498131,,,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/27248/1/Mazur-C-2015-PhD-Thesis.pdf,0,0,0

There still remains uncertainty as to how much a low-carbon energy system costs compared to a high-carbon system. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) show a large range of costs of mitigation towards the 2 C target. with up to an order of magnitude difference between the highest and lowest cost. depending on a number of factors including model structure. technology availability and costs. and the degree of feedback with the wider macro-economy. A simpler analysis potentially serves to highlight where costs fall and to what degree. Here we show that the additional cost of a lowcarbon energy system is less than 1% of global GDP more than a system resulting from low mitigation effort. The proposed approach aligns with some previous IAMs and other projections discussed in the paper. whilst also providing a clearer and more detailed view of the world. Achieving this system by 2050. with CO2 emissions of about 15GtCO2. depends heavily on decarbonisation of the electricity sector to around 100gCO2/kWh. as well as on maximising energy efficiency potential across all sectors. This scenario would require a major mitigation effort in all the assessed world regions. However. in order to keep the global mean surface temperature increase below 1.5 C. it would be necessary to achieve netzero emission by 2050. requiring a much further mitigation effort.,True,E1Mh2bEAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC,0,https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/IEJ%20-%20Vallejo%20et%20al%202021%20-%20updated.pdf,,,,,https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/IEJ%20-%20Vallejo%20et%20al%202021%20-%20updated.pdf,0,0,0

In order to evaluate the impact of different policy instruments on the uptake of energy efficiency measures. an energy-economic model is applied to the building sector. The model needs to incorporate a detailed representation of the building stock including heating and cooling technologies. as well as an explicit representation of various policy instruments. Taking into account the heterogeneity of building owners. who are the decision-makers for refurbishment investments. not only among different Member States but also within countries. the ENTRANZE project has a particular focus on the consideration of stakeholder behaviour and investor-specific barriers in the investment decision process. which also needs to be incorporated into the model.This paper provides an overview of energy-economic models for the building sector focusing on bottom-up approaches and methodologies to simulate stakeholder-specific investment decision-making. There are several existing reviews of building sector modelling. which. however. focus either on different approaches to representing energy demand (Kavgic et al. 2010; Suganthi and Samuel 2012; Swan and Ugursal 2009; Zhao and Magoulès 2012). or on technology choice and decision modelling (Mundaca et al. 2010; Wilson and Dowlatabadi 2007).,True,vSAYPbgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,6,https://www.entranze.eu/files/downloads/D4_1/D41-WP-IntegrationStakeholder_final.pdf,17019890647864323720,/scholar?cites=17019890647864323720,,,https://www.entranze.eu/files/downloads/D4_1/D41-WP-IntegrationStakeholder_final.pdf,0,0,0

Inlet pressure was varied from 0.2 MPa to 1.8 MPa. while sample initial temperature varied from 600°C to 900°C. Beck’s sequential function specification method was utilized to estimate surface heat flux and surface temperature. Inlet pressure has a positive effect on surface heat flux (SHF) within a critical value of pressure. Thickness of the sample affects the maximum achieved SHF negatively. Surface heat flux as high as 0.4024 MW/m2 was estimated for a thickness of 8.5 mm. Insulation effects of vapor film become apparent in the sample initial temperature range of 900°C causing reduction in surface heat flux and cooling rate of the sample. A sensor location near to quenched surface is found to be a better choice to visualize the effects of spray parameters on surface heat flux and surface temperature.

A Fe-P mixed  dumbbell is created in the six symmetric tilt grain boundary (STGB) models. The dumbbells are allowed to migrate at different temperatures from 400 K to 1000 K. with starting positions between 5 Å to 10 Å away from the GB core. The trajectories and mean square displacements (MSD) have been recorded to analyze the diffusion details. The Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method has been used to study the energy barrier at different positions around the GBs. Our simulation results demonstrate that the GB structure affects the diffusion mechanisms of Fe-P dumbbell. The two low Σ favored GBs display significantly weak trapping effect. which is consistent with the formation energy distribution. The reduction in the migration barrier has been observed due to the decrease of distance from the GB center. Furthermore. the barriers of migration towards the GB are lower than the barriers of migration away from the GB. As evident by NEB calculation. absorption sink effect of GB has been observed.

The effect of renewable usage. on the other hand. on global warming is not very clear. For instance. the influence of wind energy usage on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) has been a controversial research topic for the last two-three decades.

1324752,Investigation of Spontaneous Combustion Behaviour of Brown Coal and the Effect of Densification process,2016,Mohammad Reza Parsa,,,,,,Victorian brown coal (VBC). as one of Victorian’s main energy sources. is going to continue serving the Australian economy in to the foreseeable future. VBC is an attractive source of energy because of the enormity of the resource. the low (open-cut) mining cost. high reactivity and low inorganic content. However. the use of VBC is limited by its high moisture content (50 to 70 percent) which provides some serious challenges such as high CO2 emissions. low heating value and high transportation costs as a barrier to export. Thus. if VBC is to be transported over significant distances. it needs to be dried or significantly dewatered first. Generally. though drying the coal increases the risk of spontaneous combustion.     Spontaneous combustion continues to be a major issue in the world's coal industry causing safety issues and material management challenges through each stage of coal handling and utilisation. It is a consequence of self-heating of the coal. where the heat released due to chemical and/or physical processes within coal particles accumulates faster than it dissipates into the environment. Although much valuable work has been carried out to describe the spontaneous combustion behaviour of coal. studies focused on developing a fundamental scientific understanding of its physical and chemical origins are rare. especially for brown coal.     In the present work. to achieve a better understanding of brown coal spontaneous combustion mechanism(s). a variety of experimental strategies were applied.

Albuquerque. NM (United States),Energy storage technologies are positioned to play a substantial role in power delivery systems. They are being touted as an effective new resource to maintain reliability and allow for increased penetration of renewable energy. However. due to their relative infancy. there is a lack of knowledge on how these resources truly operate over time. Data analysis can help ascertain the operational and performance characteristics of these emerging technologies. Rigorous testing and data analysis are important for all stakeholders to ensure a safe. reliable system that performs predictably on a macro level. Standardizing testing and analysis approaches to verifying the performance of energy storage devices. equipment. and systems when integrating them into the grid will improve the understanding and benefit of energy storage over time from technical and economic vantage points.Demonstrating the life-cycle value and capabilities of energy storage systems begins with the data the provider supplies for analysis. After review of energy storage data received from several providers. it has become clear that some of these data are inconsistent and incomplete. raising the question of their efficacy for robust analysis. This report reviews and proposes general guidelines such as sampling rates and data points that providers must supply for robust data analysis to take place.

Golden. CO (United States),Commercial facility utility bills are often a strong function of demand charges--a fee proportional to peak power demand rather than total energy consumed. In some instances. demand charges can constitute more than 50% of a commercial customer's monthly electricity cost. While installation of behind-the-meter solar power generation decreases energy costs. its variability makes it likely to leave the peak load--and thereby demand charges--unaffected. This then makes demand charges an even larger fraction of remaining electricity costs. Adding controllable behind-the-meter energy storage can more predictably affect building peak demand. thus reducing electricity costs. Due to the high cost of energy storage technology. the size and operation of an energy storage system providing demand charge management (DCM) service must be optimized to yield a positive return on investment (ROI). The peak demand reduction achievable with an energy storage system depends heavily on a facility's load profile. so the optimal configuration will be specific to both the customer and the amount of installed solar power capacity. We explore the sensitivity of DCM value to the power and energy levels of installed solar power and energy storage systems.

Golden. CO (United States),Fort Carson. a United States Army installation located south of Colorado Springs. Colorado. is seeking to be a net-zero energy facility. As part of this initiative. the base will be constructing a micro-grid that ties to various forms of renewable energy. To reduce petroleum consumption. Fort Carson is considering grid-connected vehicles (GCVs) such as pure electric trucks to replace some of itson-base truck fleet. As the availability and affordability of distributed renewable energy generation options increase. so will the GCV options (currently. three all-electric trucks are available on the GSA schedule). The presence of GCVs on-base opens up the possibility to utilize these vehicles to provide stability to the base micro-grid. This poster summarizes work to estimate the potentialimpacts of three electric vehicle grid interactions between the electric truck fleet and the Fort Carson micro-grid: 1) full-power charging without management. 2) full-power charging capability controlled by the local grid authority. and 3) full-power charge and discharge capability controlled by the local grid authority. We found that even at relatively small adoption rates. the control ofelectric vehicle charging at Fort Carson will aid in regulation of variable renewable generation loads and help stabilize the micro-grid.,True,lTQS_b4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1011263,,,,,,0,0,0

1324794,The Rent Curse: Natural Resources. Policy Choice. and Economic Development,2019,Richard M Auty and Haydn I Furlonge,,,,,Oxford University Press. USA,The resource curse is a variant of a wider rent curse that can also be driven by geopolitical rent. regulatory rent. and labour rent. Total rent can therefore be from one-tenth to two-fifths of GDP and sometimes more. Rent is detached from the activity that generates it and is up for grabs so it feeds contents for its capture and its deployment can radically impact the development trajectory for better or worse. all too often for worse. The Rent Curse: Natural Resources. Policy Choice. and Economic Development studies two rent driven models to suggest that low rent incentivizes the elite to grow the economy efficiently. whereas high rent encourages rent siphoning for immediate enrichment at the expense of long-term growth. It looks at low rent Mauritius and high rent Trinidad and Tobago to show that low rent stimulates rapid and relatively egalitarian economic growth with incremental democratization. whereas high rent inhibits competitive diversification and frequently causes protracted growth collapses. The post-war prioritization of industry has proved a double edged sword. The Rent Curse employs rent driven models to explain why low rent East Asia has closed the income gap with advanced economies; why rent rich Latin America may be de-industrializing; why agricultural neglect launched sub-Saharan Africa on a false start to economic development; why South Asia pioneers growth through export services; and why governmenets in the oil-rich Gulf states raised the incomes of nationals without conferring the skills to sustain them.,True,ihiFtBsAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,11,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=4oN8DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:95Juthhj6eIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=sOGDijG_M8&sig=JJP-dTkdHKrCarjqbH6ezaTWRc0,16350708879936361207,/scholar?cites=16350708879936361207,,,,0,0,0
1324795,Market and economic assessment of using methanol for power generation in the Caribbean region,2009,RJ Murray and HI Furlonge,38,The Journal of The Associations of Professional Engineers of Trinidad and Tobago,1,88-99,,The cost of electricity is an important factor for sustainable development of countries in the Caribbean region. Due to current reliance on oil derivatives (diesel and fuel oil). these economies are susceptible to high prices and volatility. It is proposed here that methanol. traditionally a feedstock for petrochemicals. is an alternative fuel for power generation. requiring only minor modifications to existing infrastructure (such as plant. storage. import facilities and shipping). Modifications would address the particular fuel properties of methanol in terms of its relatively low heating value. low lubricity and high inflammability. In order to assess its overall economic viability. an integrated economic model of the entire methanol to power (MtP) chain is developed in this paper. Based on preliminary cost estimates. it is shown that the use of methanol in new gas turbine installations or retrofitted turbines and reciprocating engines may be cheaper than conventional fuels due in part to the lower market price on an energy equivalent basis. This is found to be the case especially in smaller markets which currently use fossil fuels only in reciprocating engines. However. certain countries. typically the larger ones. obtain discounted prices for diesel. which makes MtP less favorable. The extent to which renewable energy forms part of a country’s energy mix also impacts MtP’s competitiveness. Nonetheless. a reduction of up to about 10 US cents per KWh can be realised. with a potential regional MtP power market size of about 6000 MW or 16.2 billion kWh of electricity generated annually. Hypothetically. this would result in an incremental methanol market of roughly 7.1 …,True,ihiFtBsAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,7,http://www.apett.org/home/images/stories/pdf/vol38/japett_vol38_no1pp88-99rjmurray.pdf,16701338986870394867,/scholar?cites=16701338986870394867,,,http://www.apett.org/home/images/stories/pdf/vol38/japett_vol38_no1pp88-99rjmurray.pdf,0,0,0

1324803,Optimal distribution of economic value under uncertainty in the LNG business,2008,Haydn I Furlonge,,"Natural Gas Institute of the Americas, The University of Trinidad and Tobago",,,,The LNG industry has been experiencing significant changes in recent years in terms of price volatility. market growth. supply increases and infrastructure expansion (Jensen. 2003). To support these developments. fiscal and business models have been evolving at a relatively fast pace. To this extent. it is common for multiple pricing terms and conditions. taxation regimes. and ownership structures to apply to different LNG trains that are located in the same country. and even on the same industrial site. It is therefore worthwhile to examine the distribution of economic returns and to determine whether there is scope for optimization of some of the key parameters.Given the number of competing interests. value distribution along the LNG Chain poses an interesting optimization problem.

This paper proposes a unique alternative fuel blend. namely methanol and biofuels that have hitherto escaped the purview of policy-makers. Availability of fuel supply. lower environmental impact. job creation and reduction in fuel subsidy are some of the socio-economic benefits. A framework was developed for examining the economic feasibility of this alternative considering the entire energy value chain. The case study used is the power generation markets of the Caribbean. A probabilistic approach using Monte Carlo simulations was adopted to account for uncertainty in key input parameters. The results indicated that the methanol/vegetable oil chain is a feasible alternative for the Caribbean.

1324805,A review of the dynamics between the energy sector and the economy of Trinidad and Tobago,2008,E Bahaw,,,,,,Trinidad and Tobago is a small. energy-based. developing economy of the Caribbean. Using the most recent available data (2007) the energy sector in this country accounts for approximately 87 percent of exports. 48 percent of government revenue and 43 percent of gross domestic product. Historically. the sector has also been the largest recipient of foreign direct investment. Because of the importance of the energy sector to Trinidad and Tobago. an understanding of the dynamics between energy inputs and the economy can be very useful in guiding government planning and policy decision making. This paper uses correlation analysis to investigate the nature of the relationship between key energy sector parameters and macroeconomic variables. The strong degree of correlation among all the variables examined underscores the need for developing an econometric model which links the macroeconomy to the energy sector.,True,ihiFtBsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1695632,13564573866912393430,/scholar?cites=13564573866912393430,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Haydn_Furlonge/publication/228240587_A_Review_of_the_Dynamics_between_the_Energy_Sector_and_the_Economy_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago/links/00b49538f0d256a6db000000/A-Review-of-the-Dynamics-between-the-Energy-Sector-and-the-Economy-of-Trinidad-and-Tobago.pdf,0,0,0

The Mauritian government deployed its modest tapering rent stream to expand a dynamic market economy in Track 1 while postponing reform of the rent-distorted economy in Track 2 until the market economy could absorb it. Mauritius shows how expanding labour-intensive exports absorbs surplus labour. which triggers the labour-market turning point when structural change drives competitive diversification into more skill-intensive manufacturing and a proliferating range of export services (tourism. ICT. and finance). Critically. the omission of the labour-intensive industrialization phase of the competitive diversification model in Trinidad and Tobago prompted governments to combat rising unemployment by deploying rent to subsidize …,True,ihiFtBsAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/downloadpdf/10.1093/oso/9780198828860.001.0001/oso-9780198828860-chapter-5.pdf,,,,,,0,0,0

An extra-parliamentary disturbance combined with large oil windfalls through 1974–78 and 1979–81 to deflect an initially cautious developmental government into executing an overambitious strategy of gas-based industrialization. The economy experienced a growth collapse when oil prices faltered. which was protracted and sharply reduced average incomes. Eventual recovery relied on monetizing natural gas. however. which proved a minimum diversification away from hydrocarbon dependence. testifying to the inertia of rent-seeking once established.

Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the commonly used conjugated polymers for photovoltaics applications. P3HT nanostructures synthesized in soft templates provided by hexagonal mesophases show high photocatalytic activity for degradation of pollutants under both UV and visible light. These photocatalysts are very stable even after repeated cycling. Addition of scavengers and mechanistic studies show that O2− is the main radical responsible for degradation of phenol taken as a model pollutant. P3HT nanostructures can be easily deposited on flat supports such as quartz for photocatalytic applications avoiding a separation step by centrifugation.

There is a dire need to look for alternative fuels that are less potent to greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels offer several advantages with less harmful effects on the environment. Biodiesel is synthesized from the organic wastes produced extensively like edible. non-edible. microbial. and waste oils. This study reviews the feasibility of the state-of-the-art feedstocks for sustainable biodiesel synthesis such as availability. and capacity to cover a significant proportion of fossil fuels. Biodiesel synthesized from oil crops. vegetable oils. and animal fats are the potential renewable carbon-neutral substitute to petroleum fuels. This study concludes that waste oils with higher oil content including waste cooking oil. waste palm oil. and algal oil are the most favorable feedstocks. The comparison of biodiesel production and parametric analysis is done critically. which is necessary to come up with the most appropriate feedstock for biodiesel synthesis. Since the critical comparison of feedstocks along with oil extraction and biodiesel production technologies has never been done before. this will help to direct future researchers to use more sustainable feedstocks for biodiesel synthesis. This study concluded that the use of third-generation feedstocks (wastes) is the most appropriate way for sustainable biodiesel production. The use of innovative costless oil extraction technologies including supercritical and microwave-assisted transesterification method is recommended for oil extraction.

Unlike hard templates. which need a harsh chemical reagent to extract nanomaterials after the synthesis. in soft template hexagonal mesophases. the extraction process of nanomaterials is simple. only by washing with ethanol or 2-propanol. Another interesting property of this class of template lies on its ability to be swollen by controlling the ratio of oil to water.This thesis is divided into three parts: 1) Radiolytic synthesis of metal nanostructures in the aqueous phase of hexagonal mesophases and their application in fuel cells (ethanol oxidation). 2) Synthesis of conjugated polymer nanostructures in the oil phase of hexagonal mesophases for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. 3) Combined synthesis in the oil and water phases of hexagonal mesophases of metal-polymer nanocomposites.Several metal nanostructures such as PdPt nanoballs with controlled composition and porosity.

1324892,A tariff for reactive power,2008,John Kueck and ORNL Fangxing Fran Li,,"Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL); Cooling, Heating and Power Integration Laboratory, Tech. Rep.",,,,Two kinds of power are required to operate an electric power system: real power. measured in watts. and reactive power. measured in volt-amperes reactive or VARs. Reactive power supply is one of a class of power system reliability services collectively known as ancillary services. and is essential for the reliable operation of the bulk power system. Reactive power flows when current leads or lags behind voltage. Typically. the current in a distribution system lags behind voltage because of inductive loads such as motors. Reactive power flow wastes energy and capacity and causes voltage droop. To correct lagging power flow. leading reactive power (current leading voltage) is supplied to bring the current into phase with voltage. When the current is in phase with voltage. there is a reduction in system losses. an increase in system capacity. and a rise in voltage.Reactive power can be supplied from either static or dynamic VAR sources. Static sources are typically transmission and distribution equipment. such as capacitors at substations. and their cost has historically been included in the revenue requirement of the transmission operator (TO). and recovered through cost-of-service rates. By contrast. dynamic sources are typically generators capable of producing variable levels of reactive power by automatically controlling the generator to regulate voltage. Transmission system devices such as synchronous condensers can also provide dynamic reactive power. A class of solid state devices (called flexible AC transmission system devices or FACTs) can provide dynamic reactive power.

1324920,Remote sensing applications: Beyond land-use and land-cover change,2013,Chris W Baynard,2013,,,,Scientific Research Publishing,Remotely sensed (RS) imagery is increasingly being adopted in investigations and applications outside of traditional land-use land-cover change (LUCC) studies. This is due to the increased awareness by governments. NGOs and Industry that earth observation data provide important and useful spatial and temporal information that can be used to make better decisions. design policies and address problems that range in scale from local to global. Additionally. citizens are increasingly adopting spatial analysis into their work as they utilize a suite of readily available geospatial tools. This paper examines some of the ways remotely sensed images and derived maps are being extended beyond LUCC to areas such as fire modeling. coastal and marine applications. infrastructure and urbanization. archeology. and to ecological. or infrastructure footprint analysis. Given the interdisciplinary approach of such work. this paper organizes selected studies into broad categories identified above. Findings demonstrate that RS data and technologies are being widely used in many fields. ranging from fishing to war fighting. As technology improves. costs go down. quality increases and data become increasingly available. greater numbers of organizations and local citizens will be using RS in important everyday applications.,True,xbEb2vIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,13,https://www.scirp.org/html/3-2630047_36011.htm,3698837445614520126,/scholar?cites=3698837445614520126,,,https://www.scirp.org/html/3-2630047_36011.htm,0,0,0

1324922,A geospatial approach to measuring surface disturbance related to oil and gas activities in west Florida. USA,2014,Chris W Baynard and Robert W Schupp and Pingying Zhang and Paul Fadil,3,Advances in Remote Sensing,02,77,Scientific Research Publishing,Oil and gas exploration and production activities (OGEPA) can produce surface disturbances created by the construction of roads. well pads. oil wells. pipelines. production facilities and storage pits. These alterations can range from landscape conversion to transformation depending on location. regulations and enforcement. environmental best practices and state vs. multinational management. Though not known as a major oil and gas state. Florida is ranked 23rd in gas and 24th in oil production nationally. Jay oilfield. located in West Florida’s panhandle region. is the largest and top producer in the state. Though production peaked in 1979. a nationwide upsurge is taking place that could affect Florida. The accounting from above approach proposed here is well suited to understand the role that the infrastructure surface footprint has on West Florida’s landscape and how to monitor potential changes underway. It involves remote sensing. GIS techniques and landscape ecology metrics to quantify surface disturbance in Santa Rosa County’s six oilfields and then ranks each field based on environmental performance (sustainability). Findings suggest that agricultural conversion is the leading driver of land-use and land-cover (LULC) change. while OGEPA have created small-scale surface alterations.

1324925,Assessing landscape disturbance and the ecological situation of energy development in the US and Russia,2016,C Baynard and K Mjachina and R Richardson and A Chibilyev,26,International Environmental Technology,1,44,,Energy development landscape studies often centre on better understanding how oil and gas extraction creates alterations on the land that contribute to habitat fragmentation. colonisation and loss of natural areas. Today. however. energy sources are drawing on renewables such as solar and wind. because they are viewed as cleaner. don’t emit CO2. they receive incentives. and are being increasingly required as part of a balanced energy mix in many US states.Meanwhile. these alternative supplies are seen as creating less adverse environmental effects than oil and gas. Yet they too create a disturbance footprint on the landscape that can lead to permanent loss of habitat. thus affecting carbon stores. ecosystem goods and services and biodiversity. This issue is particularly salient in sensitive areas. such as steppes with unique and diminishing grasslands. Additionally. wind turbines often lead to bird and bat mortalities. Our current research on energy production aims to develop diagnostic indicators for mapping and measuring surface disturbance related to energy development. both hydrocarbon and renewable wind power. As part of our NSF-CRDF grant. American and Russian teams are studying energy landscapes in northeastern Colorado and western Russia. Using remote sensing and GIS data and techniques we examine the Pawnee National Grasslands in Weld County.

1324927,Nuclear bomb testing in the western US: a legacy of environmental and social effects in southern Nevada,2017,Chris Baynard and Adrienne Sebesta,,,,,,This work provides an introduction into the environmental and social effects of the nuclear testing legacy in the western US. For four decades. the US government detonated nuclear bombs in the southern Nevada desert. creating a militarized landscape whose environmental effects endure to the present. A series of over 1.000 mainly underground tests throughout the area has converted this desert environment into what appears as a lunar landscape. pockmarked by numerous clustered craters. These tests also prompted nearly 700 earthquakes ranging up to 5.8 on the Richter scale. Although this area is desert and access restricted. the loss of natural desert shrub vegetation in this sensitive ecosystem resulted in the introduction of pioneer species. changing the character of the landscape. Moreover. nearby towns and communities across 3 states were exposed to nuclear radiation from prevailing winds at the time. resulting in elevated adverse and deadly health effects. Presently. groundwater contamination of a crucial aquifer has placed other communities at risk. The history and trajectory of this area has led to the notion that part of Nevada will become a permanent environmental sacrifice zone. In this work. we adopt geospatial data and techniques used to measure the effects of extractive activities on the landscape. to map and quantify the surface disturbance created by these nuclear-related features. Additionally. we model detonation scenarios across several test site locations to better understand vulnerable communities.

When biomolecules are immobilized on electrode surfaces. it is very important to have a control on all the possible conformational changes that may occur. either upon the recognition of their targets or by undesired alterations. Both enzymes and aptamers immobilized on electrodes are susceptible to conformational changes as a response to the nature of the charge of the surface and of the surrounding environment (pH. temperature. ionic strength. etc.).

The VRES considered are wind. solar photovoltaics (PV) and concentrating solar power (CSP). which by 2030 should provide all together about 45–50% of the total electricity demand in order to comply with the European Union (EU) Directives and the Paris 2016 Climate Agreements. As we will show. these levels of VRES would create important problems of surplus and needed backup energies. especially in the lack of sufficient electricity storage facilities. Therefore. it will be needed during the transition period the parallel use of fossil conventional backup plants. with their corresponding associated emissions.

1324966,Present state and perspectives of variable renewable energies in Spain,2018,Roberto Gómez-Calvet and José Manuel Martínez-Duart and Silvia Serrano Calle,133,The European Physical Journal Plus,3,1-12,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,In accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement (2015) and the more recent European Union Winter Package of November 2016. the European nations have committed to drastically cut CO2 emissions during the next decades. especially in the power sector. To this end. Spain as well as many other European countries are initiating plans for a large deployment of variable renewable energy sources (VRES). especially motivated by the huge lowering in prices of solar and wind installations. In the first part of this work. a detailed analysis of the current Spanish electricity mix is carried out. especially of the present generation by VRES. To this end. we present hourly and daily fan charts. for the different days of the week as well as months or seasons of the year.

1324967,On the Assessment of the 2030 Power Sector Transition in Spain,2019,Roberto Gómez-Calvet and José M Martínez-Duart,12,Energies,7,1369,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Recently. the European Union has recognized that more ambitious plans in reducing emissions are needed in order to comply with the target 1.5–2 warming limit for this century. Along this line. the main objective of this paper is to study the evolution of the power sector in Spain. taking into account the Paris Agreement and the further European Union Directives. In particular. we have studied the substitution by renewable energies of all coal power plants before 2030. For this study. we have applied linear programming techniques to optimize the deployment of the additional wind and solar resources. If. in addition to the substitution of coal power plants. we also consider the expected increase in demand for the period 2019–2030. we find that the present park of renewables should be increased by a factor of about 115%. We have also statistically analyzed the amount of surpluses and shortages in energy. assuming that the demand curve would have a daily shape similar to the present one. As a result. we have found that additional storage capabilities of around 55 GWh for 11 h would be needed in order not to waste more than 25% surplus energy by curtailment. As for backup. we propose in a first step to use the overwhelming amount of gas combined cycle units which are available.

Water is an essential in meaningful experience of the visitors. who have an internal relation with this touristic resource as an attraction. As a cultural resource is associated with symbolic and artistic meanings. In urban areas where water is often ignored and its heritage elements are underestimated. the valorisation of its heritage elements and natural state is essential to create a safeguard and protection attitude towards this vital asset of life. To value is to recognise importance. to understand significance. to act towards conservation in both natural and cultural angles. particularly in cities where the conservation of water resources is critical and ignored in an urban development process. In this perspective. the present study attempts to analyse the water heritage state in the historical city Guimarães with the aim to valorise the water heritage resources linked to traditions and local historical narratives. Giving significance to those historical assets. aims to promote sustainable use and sustainable visit development.

Moreover. users actively engage in social media not only as a means to be informed about products and services but also to share their consumption experiences. Tourism in general. and sustainable tourism in particular. can benefit of the use of social media both as a marketing communication tool and as a venue for travellers to share their travel experiences through user-created content. That is. social media can satisfy both travellers and suppliers regarding sustainable tourism experiences. On the one hand. travellers can use social media not only to be informed about sustainable tourism destinations (pre-trip) but also to share on-trip and post-trip experiences. On the other hand. suppliers can use social media marketing to communicate their offer to travellers and other stakeholders. Nevertheless. despite an increasing academic effort over the last years to better understanding the use of social media in the area of tourism. the research in the specific area of sustainable tourism seems to be scarce. To fill this research gap. the main goal of this study is to gain a better knowledge on how travellers and suppliers are using social media in the context of sustainable tourism.

Berkeley. CA (United States),Reducing energy consumption through investment in advanced technologies and practices can enhance American manufacturing competitiveness. Energy bandwidth studies of US manufacturing sectors serve as general data references to help stakeholders understand the range (or bandwidth) of potential energy savings opportunities. The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has commissioned a series of bandwidth studies to analyze energy-intensive processes and provide technology-based estimates of potential energy savings opportunities. Most recently. AMO has commissioned a bandwidth study to analyze the energy consumption characteristics of desalination systems for municipal water.

Over 50 industrial facilities are participating and 28 facilities have been certified in the SEP program. These facilities find value in the robust. data driven energy performance improvement result that the SEP program delivers. Previous analysis of SEP certified facility data demonstrated the cost effectiveness of SEP and identified internal staff time to be the largest cost component related to SEP implementation and certification. This paper analyzes previously reported and newly collected data of costs and benefits associated with the implementation of an ISO 50001 and SEP certification. By disaggregating “sunk energy management system (EnMS) labor costs”. this analysis results in a more accurate and detailed understanding of the costs and benefits of SEP participation. SEP is shown to significantly improve and sustain energy performance and energy cost savings. resulting in a highly attractive return on investment. To illustrate these results. a payback function has been developed and is presented.

1324988,Energy Savings from Industrial Water Reductions,2015,Prakash Rao and Aimee McKane and Andre de Fontaine,,,LBNL-190943,,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Berkeley. CA (United States),Although it is widely recognized that reducing freshwater consumption is of critical importance. generating interest in industrial water reduction programs can be hindered for a variety of reasons. These include the low cost of water. greater focus on water use in other sectors such as the agriculture and residential sectors. high levels of unbilled and/or unregulated self-supplied water use in industry. and lack of water metering and tracking capabilities at industrial facilities. However. there are many additional components to the resource savings associated with reducing site water use beyond the water savings alone. such as reductions in energy consumption. greenhouse gas emissions. treatment chemicals. and impact on the local watershed. Understanding and quantifying these additional resource savings can expand the community of businesses. NGOs. government agencies. and researchers with a vested interest in water reduction.   This paper will develop a methodology for evaluating the embedded energy consumption associated with water use at an industrial facility. The methodology developed will use available data and references to evaluate the energy consumption associated with water supply and wastewater treatment outside of a facility’s fence line for various water sources. It will also include a framework for evaluating the energy consumption associated with water use within a facility’s fence line. The methodology will develop a more complete picture of the total resource savings associated with water reduction efforts and allow industrial water reduction programs to assess the energy and CO2 savings associated with their efforts.,True,B8zjHvUAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,5,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2w8348pf,14529337642521824941,/scholar?cites=14529337642521824941,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt2w8348pf/qt2w8348pf.pdf,0,0,0

As a first step. estimates of US manufacturing water use are required. A lack of data on manufacturing water use characteristics hampers efforts to make these quantifications. In lieu of primary data. this paper will present a method for better understanding US manufacturing water use characteristics. This methodology consists of three elements. The first element develops the data requirements for developing a manufacturing facility’s water footprint within the context of the watershed. The second element develops top down estimates of the water data identified in the first element at the national. state. and county-levels by subsector. These estimates are developed through leveraging Canadian water use data and correlations to the US based on subsector operational characteristics. The third element uses the data from the second to identify subsectors that are most vulnerable to water access issues. This element recognizes that evaluations based solely on total water use may diminish the importance of water in some sectors. This paper will present preliminary results from applying the first and second elements of this estimation method.

Furthermore. many of the existing data sets focus on motor efficiency and neglect the connected drive and system. Without a comprehensive survey of the installed motor system base. a baseline energy efficiency of a country or region’s motor systems cannot be developed.

1325000,Buoyancy considerations in a fluidized bed of ground particles,2009,Prakash R Rao,,,,,,The research conducted for this thesis determines and quantifies the forces acting on a large submerged object in a gas-solid fluidized bed of Geldart A ground particles at the onset of bubbling. In particular. the additional load from the previously reported defluidized region of particles found above submerged objects in fluidized beds is quantified. A force model was developed and comparisons between this and the experimental data yielded properties of the de-fluidized region. such as the shape and height of the hood. and the angle to which it rises. Drag is measured by comparing forces on objects of different geometries subject to the same conditions. Buoyancy was measured by summing the pressure force acting to push the submerged object out of the bed and the counteracting pressure force of the bed over the submerged object pushing it deeper into the bed. The de-fluidized region is found to have a significant impact on the buoyancy of the object by creating an additional weight force above the object thus increasing the pressure in this region. Explanations for the hood shape and size are made through phenomenological results obtained through visual observations. Particle transport through voidage collapses at the surface. ie “bubbling”. create a secondary particle circulation within the bed adding particles to the top of the hood.

In Europe. the residential sector accounts for 27% of the final energy consumption [1]. and therefore contributes significantly to CO2 emissions. Roadmaps towards energy-efficient buildings have been proposed [2]. In such a context. the detailed characterization of residential building stocks in terms of age. type of construction. insulation level. energy vector. and of evolution prospects appears to be a useful contribution to the assessment of the impact of implementation of energy policies.

In such heat exchangers. it is commonly known that the formation of a frost layer on the surface generates an additional thermal resistance and a flow section reduction. which leads to an overall degradation of the overall unit performance.

Each zone is handled independently and the relative proportion of each zone is determined by means of the exchanger wall temperature. Besides this frost model. a defrost model is also envisaged.

1325036,Designing and testing an air-PCM heat exchanger for building ventilation application coupled to energy storage,2014,Bertrand Dechesne and Samuel Gendebien and Jonathan Martens and Vincent Lemort,,,,,,Due to the increase of energy costs. buildings energy consumption has tended to decrease in the past decades. This gives an opportunity for developing innovative renewable technologies that are more adapted to recent buildings with low energy demand. In this context. one main challenge is to manage non-simultaneous availability of heat source or sink and the energy demand of buildings. Hence. different technologies dedicated to energy storage have been developed recently; one of them is the use of Phase Change Materials (PCM). These materials are considered because they exhibit a high latent energy and a tunable phase change temperature according to their composition. This paper studies a PCM heat exchanger coupled to a building ventilation system. This PCM module can either store heat during the day (eg by cooling solar PV panels) and restore it to the building during the night for space heating purposes or store coolness during the night and give it back during the day and thus act as a free cooling system. This project aims to develop a performing air-PCM heat exchanger providing latent energy storage of 0.5 kWh. this energy is delivered between 15 and 30 C. This heat exchanger is based on corrugated cells that can be easily filled. lined up and then locked in a box. letting the air pass between the cells. The PCM used for the prototype is mainly composed of paraffin. In order to develop an efficient PCM ventilation module. two different ways of investigation were followed and used in parallel. The first one used CFD simulations and the second one. a semi-empirical model based on correlations.

A building ventilation model can be built on a set of resistances and generators in order to handle infiltration. natural ventilation as well as fan driven air flows. The model is able to assess the indoor air humidity level and the building energy balance.Double flow ventilation can be handled through decentralized air handling terminals (DAHT). integrated in window ledges. A model of DAHT can be combined with the model of a whole building envelope. including infiltrations as well as dynamic behaviour. allowing comparisons with classical ventilation systems. such as natural or hybrid systems. or with centralized double flow systems.

The system consists of five components: a simple exhaust ventilation system. an exhaust air heat pump. a backup electrical resistance for space heating only. a domestic hot water storage tank and fan-coil units to heat the building. In that system. the heat source of the heat pump is the air from the ventilation system and the heat pump heating capacity is limited to 1500 W. During the night. the exhaust air heat pump produces the sanitary hot water. which is stored in a water tank. Consequently. the totality of the domestic hot water is produced by the heat pump. During the day. the heat pump can also be used to heat the building. Nevertheless. only a part of the energy requirements related to heating are covered by the machine. due to the limited heating capacity. The remaining heating requirements are covered by the backup electrical resistance. For this reason. this machine is particularly suitable for apartment buildings characterized by a low heating demand and a significant energy demand related to domestic hot water production. In the first part of the paper. the characteristics of the building case study and the different components of the system are presented. The second part of the paper describes the sensors placed in the building used to measure the on-site performance of the machine.

1325054,Performances of a simple exhaust mechanical ventilation coupled to a mini heat pump: modeling and experimental investigations,2015,Frédéric Ransy and Samuel Gendebien and Vincent Lemort,,,,,,[en] According to the European directive 2012/27/EU of October 2012 on energy efficiency. buildings represented 40% of the EU’s final energy consumption in 2011. The major part of this energy consumption is due to the residential sector for space heating and domestic hot water production. Moreover. buildings are crucial to achieve the EU objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990.In order to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions. retrofit measures regarding insulation and air-tightness have to be taken. However. such improvements of the building envelope lead to a relative increase in consumption related to ventilation. Indeed. according to Orme (2001). Roulet et al.(2001) and Fouih et al.(2012). the heating demand due to ventilation can reach more than 50% of the total building heating demand for new and retrofitted buildings.,True,HBkeevgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,1,https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/186742,16889088378103968290,/scholar?cites=16889088378103968290,,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/186742/1/AIVC_Conference_Paper_Frederic_Ransy_Final.pdf,0,0,0

The most common retrofit option concerns the air tightness and the thermal insulation improvement. However. this latter retrofit option could decrease the air indoor quality because of a reduction of air infiltration flow rate. Installation of an air-to-air heat recovery system allows for an efficient combination between consumption reduction due to the air tightness improvement and acceptable air indoor quality. The study presented in this paper has been realized in the frame of the „Green+‟ project. which aims at developing decentralized heat recovery ventilation systems.The present paper focuses on modeling and experimental validation of an air-to-air heat recovery exchanger in partially wet conditions (ie where condensation might occur in one of the two air streams). The knowledge of the thermal performance in dry and wet regimes is essential since it highly impacts on the heat recovered from the vitiated air flow rate (extracted from the building) to the fresh air flow rate (coming from the outdoor).,True,HBkeevgAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,1,https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/104184,11673630611916543885,/scholar?cites=11673630611916543885,,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/104184/1/Paper_587_v2_good.pdf,0,0,0

For instance. previous fluids research emphasized that NPs bring about pore plugging. which reduces pressure transmission and. in turn. fluid inflow. into the shale pore matrix. which ultimately helps stabilize the borehole. However. it is difficult to understand how pore plugging might be accomplished in the absence of any substantial filtration in shales. considering that the minimal permeability of shales does not allow for any appreciable Darcy flow.

This is particularly the case for shallow horizontal wells which are often limited in their extent by torque. By minimizing both wellbore length and torque it is likely that a wellbore designed to reach a specific target can be drilled more quickly and cheaply than other potential trajectories. However. these two objectives are often in conflict with each other and related in a highly non-linear manner.

In conventional drilling. the only widely accepted response to a gas influx is to shut the well in on the BOPs. New Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) technology using the constant bottom-hole pressure (CBHP) technique allows for circulating small and medium-sized influxes out without the need to shut in the well. either by increasing casing back-pressure and/or adjusting pump flow rate. Evident benefits include a faster response to the influx (with clear safety benefits) and a considerable time and cost savings compared to the conventional approach.Unfortunately. there is currently no method available to decide upon the best MPD-CBHP response during an influx. because such a response depends on many parameters. such as Maximum Allowable Surface Pressure (MASP). wellbore geometry. fracture pressure …,True,C0rSmEYAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,23,https://onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-170324-MS,9092654018924093165,/scholar?cites=9092654018924093165,,,,0,0,0

When drilling fluids started to be deliberately used for hole-making. the (in-) compatibility of these fluids with clay-rich shale formations became immediately apparent. and industry scientist have been trying to make sense of it all ever since. With a plethora of possible shale tests available. a key question remains: what are the best. most representative tests to characterize fluid-shale interactions and avoid making decisions based on less sensitive tests that may suffer from artifacts and yield misleading results?This paper argues for the use of a representative set of shale tests that includes accretion tests. cuttings dispersion tests and mud pressure transmission tests. while pointing out issues and problems with other tests such as atmospheric swelling tests and capillary suction tests. which still find widescale application in the industry. Moreover. it introduces a novel. low cost borehole stability test in the form of a modified thick wall cylinder test. This new test exposes a cylindrical shale samples. confined under downhole temperature and pressure. to mud formulations at overbalance for a specified period of time and assesses the failure strength of the sample thereafter.

Current hydraulic models in the industry fail to accurately predict the frictional pressure losses of certain mud formulations in turbulent flow due to the complex behavior of long-chain polymer additives. These additives facilitate friction reduction in certain flow regimes. This reduction depends on several parameters. such as molecular weight and chemical composition of the polymers. making it difficult to quantify using existing models.

This paper shows how fluid rheological behavior can be more accurately monitored for better hydraulics modeling and control using real-time automated rheology measurement. A series of experiments was performed using a fully automated high temperature pipe viscometer in order to understand the effects of long chain polymer-based additives commonly used in drilling. completions. and well intervention operations on fluid behavior in laminar. transitional and turbulent flow. Frictional pressure losses were measured in a cesium formate fluid viscosified with concentrations of xanthan gum up to 2.5 lb/bbl at temperatures ranging from 100–230 F. Results were compared with widely used theoretical models for frictional pressure losses. showing significant discrepancy between current theory and empirical results. First. contrary to expectations. the polymers were observed to shift their role from viscosifier in the laminar range to friction/drag reducer in the transitional and turbulent ranges. Secondly. increasing temperature has a non-trivial effect on pressure loss measurements. Thirdly. shear degradation effects on the polymer need to be accounted for. particularly in fully developed turbulent flow.

Some of the challenges associated with these depleted zones include severe mud loss and associated borehole problems. as well as troublesome cementing and poor zonal isolation. Artificially strengthening the wellbore is now becoming of crucial importance in order to successfully drill and cement deepwater wells in mature fields and any other wells with narrow drilling margins.In this paper. we introduce an innovative thermal wellbore strengthening (TWBS) technique to elevate the tangential stress (also known as the hoop stress) near the wellbore. and consequently increase the fracture gradient. A “thermal fluid”. consisting of a carrier mud with heat-releasing (“exothermic”) coated particles. has been designed to target depleted zones and release heat at exactly the right time to increase near-wellbore thermal stress. which directly elevates the near-wellbore tangential stress and in turn elevates the effective fracture gradient. Ultimately. this lowers the risk of lost circulation and improves the chance of successfully cementing and achieving zonal isolation. For instance. a TWBS treatment can be executed as an integral part of the cement job by using it in an extended spacer train for mud displacement. pumped directly prior to cement placement. The coated exothermic particles were designed such that they could release their “payload” via an extended time-release mechanism. to …,True,C0rSmEYAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/49552263/SPE-180315_Thermal_Strengthening_Finalx5.pdf,,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49552263/SPE-180315_Thermal_Strengthening_Finalx5.pdf,0,0,0

Novel measurement tools and techniques are now making it possible to carry out sophisticated drilling fluid analyses using largely automated equipment. This paper anticipates and highlights the important role that automated particle size analyzers will play in future drilling operations. A comprehensive experimental study was carried out using a new generation of particle size analyzers (PSA) to investigate their utility for automated drilling fluid analysis. The pieces of equipment that were evaluated were the Canty Microflow LPA (which uses imaging microscopy). the Mettler Toledo G400 ParticleTrack (which uses FBRM laser diffraction) and the Malvern Mastersizer and Zetasizer (which use Dynamic Light Scattering). These instruments were used in conjunction with inhouse flow loops and shearing facilities to test (1) degradation of the particle size distribution (PSD) of lost circulation and wellbore strengthening materials under the influence of shear.(2) the behavior of the emulsion droplet size distribution (DSD) of invert emulsion mud systems (oil-based and synthetic-based muds).Verifying and maintaining the PSD of lost circulation/wellbore strengthening materials is of crucial importance to prevent severe mud loss events that still continue to plague the industry at a trouble cost of many billions of dollars per annum. Our PSA analyses show that the PSD’s of such materials. particularly those of medium to coarser sizes. is far from stable and degrades over time. primarily due to the influence of shear.

In conventional drilling. the only widely accepted response to a gas influx is to shut the well in on the BOPs. New Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) technology using the constant bottom-hole pressure (CBHP) technique allows for circulating small and medium-sized influxes out without the need to shut in the well. either by increasing casing back-pressure and/or adjusting pump flow rate. Evident benefits include a faster response to the influx (with clear safety benefits) and a considerable time and cost savings compared to the conventional approach.Unfortunately. there is currently no method available to decide upon the best MPD-CBHP response during an influx. because such a response depends on many parameters. such as Maximum Allowable Surface Pressure (MASP). wellbore geometry. fracture pressure of any weak zones exposed in open hole. type of drilling fluid. influx size. etc. To remedy this situation. we present a fast and accurate decision-making method that overcomes the traditional difficulties and automatically selects a best well control response.

Using annual time-series data covering the period 1971–2016 it is found that financial development increases aggregate CO2. CO2 emissions from the transport sector. and CO2 consumption from liquid fuel but reduces CO2 emissions from manufacturing and construction as well as the residential and building. Natural resource extraction exerts upward pressure on CO2 emissions from the manufacturing and construction sector as well as from the consumption of gaseous fuels whiles the contrary is found for CO2 emissions.

However. researchers seem to have given little attention to Sub-Saharan African (SSA) in this ongoing discourse despite the wide per capita income disparity gap in the region. This present study fills this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of per capita income convergence hypothesis in SSA based on the strict assumption of a closed economy without government activities of the HC-ASM. The hypothesis is further tested by relaxing these restrictive assumptions specifically. by including into the basic model. government spending. FDI and openness to trade.

Over the past four decades. several theoretical and empirical investigations have been conducted aimed at arriving at the exact relationship between economic growth and environmental quality. Such investigations are particularly important given that achieving growth and development that are sustainable also require due consideration of the impact of those growth policies on the environment.Using a panel dataset from 1985-2010 on 36 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. the study examines the environmental impact of economic growth with greater emphasis on disaggregated growth.

Incidentally. the growing commitment by South Africa to achieve greater economic expansion has culminated into consistent increase in economic activities which invariably entail ever-increasing energy consumption and its associated inevitable stern implications on the quality and sustainability of environment especially on CO2 emissions. Clearly. these emissions. which emanate from sources such as transport. residential and commercial activities inter alia. are attributable mainly to human activities that are directly linked with economic growth (activities) and development. Yet. to date. growth in scale of economic activities appears not to have been matched by a comparable growth in environmental protection policies. In the wake of economic expansion and industrial activities in South Africa coupled with rising mining activities. population and rapid urbanisation; energy consumption/demand could be expected to rise monotonically in the years ahead. a situation that could have severe adverse implications on the environment.

1325113,Is Energy Consumption Responsible for Environmental Degradation in Ghana?,2019,Solomon Aboagye,9,Journal of Applied Economics and Business Research,1,38-50,,The quest to achieve greater expansion in the Ghanaian economy has culminated into consistent increase in economic activities which invariably entail ever-increasing energy consumption. Given the theoretical linkages between energy consumption and environmental degradation. then the continual increase in energy in the production. distribution and consumption of goods and services in Ghana could have stern implications on the quality of environment and in particular. on three major indicators of environmental degradation (namely. CO2 emissions. Biological Oxygen Density (BOD) and deforestation). Relying on recent annual dataset from the World Bank for the period 1980-2016 this study seeks to examine the environmental impact of energy consumption in Ghana within the standard Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) framework. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lagged model estimation. the study reveals among other findings that energy consumption tends to increase air. water and land pollutions measured respectively by CO2 emissions. BOD and deforestation. This renders support to the assertion that the energy consumption could be blamed for a rise in environmental degradation in Ghana. Further. a robust EKC could not be established for any of the three environmental degradation indicators. This outcome is a major point of concern as the evidence does not support the view that Ghana can grow out of pollution problems with wealth within the context of energy consumption. Notwithstanding.

This has become necessary given the several attempts by economies to increase productivity while safeguarding the environment to foster sustainable development. This study progresses from previous research to examine the disaggregated impact of economic expansion on the environment. Consequently. the study employs the Autoregressive Distributive Lagged (ARDL) approach to cointegration and annual time series data from 1985 to 2015. from the World Bank database. to examine the disaggregated impact of economic expansion on the environment in Ghana. The study finds that initial stages of agricultural expansion tends to deteriorate the environment. but as agricultural productivity increases beyond a certain point. although the effect on BOD and deforestation may still rise. CO 2 emission reduces. More so. expansion in industry results in a rise in all three indicators of environmental degradation. both in the short and long run while a harmful effect was found between expansion in service output and CO 2 emission at the initial stages of productivity. but not in the long-run. The impact on BOD and deforestation is harmful with expansion in service output. The results point to the fact that expansions in agriculture and services will eventually result in the reduction of CO 2 emissions beyond some productivity threshold.,True,F60vDYwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajer/article/view/192198,,,,,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajer/article/download/192198/181312,0,0,0

Reaction paths are reported for uncatalyzed and Lewis and Brønsted acid-catalyzed reactions in vacuum and in a broad range of solvents. The calculations show that. while the uncatalyzed Diels–Alder reaction is thermally feasible in vacuum. a Lewis acid (modeled as Na+) lowers the activation barrier by interacting with the dienophile (MA) and decreasing the HOMO–LUMO gap of the reactants. A Brønsted acid (modeled as a proton) can bind to a carbonyl oxygen in MA. changing the reaction mechanism from concerted to stepwise and eliminating the activation barrier.

To explain this behavior we used density functional theory and statistical mechanics to investigate high and low temperature mechanisms for this reaction and propose a dynamic active site change in response to temperature variation. Our simulations show that the apparent activation barrier in the low temperature regime is more negative over Brønsted acidic CHA as compared to the siliceous zeolite framework. This effect is attributed to further enthalpic stabilization of the transition states by physical interaction with the H-CHA Brønsted acid sites. At elevated temperature. our calculations support both the existence and the significant catalytic role of NO+ in …,True,K-HBox0AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951720302074,15901077571727049272,/scholar?cites=15901077571727049272,,,,0,0,0

The random phase approximation is employed to calculate the dynamically screened electron–electron interactions at different temperatures. electron energies and densities. This study is limited to the electrons which are close to the Fermi level so that only quasi-particles contribute to the scattering rate. It is shown that while scattering rate increases slightly with increasing well separation. this effect weakens quickly and broadening tends to a certain limit which is the electron broadening in a single quantum layer.

The relative reaction rates in this competition limit levoglucosan yields from cellulose pyrolysis to approximately 60 wt%.,True,ipaMO6kAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,35,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/gc/c8gc03461c,16432314421689304640,/scholar?cites=16432314421689304640,,,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/getauthorversionpdf/c8gc03461c,0,0,0

However. this reaction is limited by the formation of coke. which can exceed 40% of carbon atoms present in the raw biomass feedstock. The role of structural parameters on coking remains unclear with both internal micropore diffusion and external mass transfer limitations hypothesized to actively contribute to carbon deposition. Here. we decouple the role of these parameters by comparing conventional in situ pyrolysis tests using model compounds to experiments performed with the reactant preadsorbed onto the zeolite catalyst. Experimental results supported by calculation of the mass transfer Biot number point to micropore diffusion as the dominant cause of coke formation. Specifically. the presence of defects such as internal crystal grain boundaries …,True,ipaMO6kAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,20,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b01578,15600942682553006997,/scholar?cites=15600942682553006997,,,,0,0,0
1325176,What limits the yield of levoglucosan during fast pyrolysis of cellulose?,2017,Juan Sebastian Proano-Aviles,,,,,Iowa State University,The pyrolysis of cellulose to form levoglucosan is investigated in this study. Although the stoichiometric yield of levoglucosan from the pyrolysis of cellulose is expected to be 100%. only about 60 wt.% yields are reported in the literature.[1–3] Several possible reasons for this limitation are investigated through experiments in micropyrolyzers and computational studies on the depolymerization of cellulose. Heat and mass transfer limitations in an experimental apparatus is one possible limitation on the yield of levoglucosan. Repolymerization of condensed phase reaction intermediates could prevent the formation and release of volatile levoglucosan. Thermohydrolysis of pyrolyzing cellulose to form non-volatile and thermally unstable glucose has also been proposed as a mechanism that reduces levoglucosan yields. Secondary reactions in the gas phase were also investigated to explain limitations on levoglucosan yields. Population balance models were developed to test ideas on how cellulose depolymerized to form levoglucosan at less than stoichiometric yields. These models were supported with chemical kinetic data obtained from transient pyrolysis experiments.,True,ipaMO6kAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,4,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/15607/,2581112786117098493,/scholar?cites=2581112786117098493,,,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6614&context=etd,0,0,0

Different cytocompatible biomaterials have been developed for this application; however. there is no production of this type of materials in Ecuador. A viable alternative. to produce biomaterials that help cellular regeneration is the use of lignocellulosic material which can be found in agroindustrial waste. due to its high biocompatibility. Therefore. the present study evaluates the use of waste from the pod shell of cacao type CCN-51. which is abundant in Ecuador. for the production of porous scaffolds by alkaline treatments applying a response surface design (Central Composite Designs). Scaffolds were produced by means of an alkaline attack using NaOH. varying operating conditions such as reactant concentration. biomass concentration. operating time. temperature. and mesocarp dimensions to generate a prediction model through the implementation of a central composite design (CCD). It was found that temperature and NaOH concentration were the most influential variables in the model.

In general. low heating rates favor dehydration to char while high heating rates favor depolymerization to levoglucosan. Although simple reaction models have been proposed to describe these competing pathways. they have not been thoroughly explored.Our research suggests that both chemical kinetics and physical phenomena influence the conversion of cellulose to products.

However. if reliable uncertainty intervals around these figures cannot be presented. the savings reported are questionable. Although required by SANS 50010: 2017. many M&V professionals are unsure about how uncertainty should be quantified in practice. which statistical methods and measures to use. and how to combine the different sources of uncertainty. Many clients are also unsure about how to judge the quality of M&V reports. and whether due diligence was applied in the calculations.

1325203,A Bayesian approach to energy monitoring optimization,2017,Herman Carstens,,,,,,This thesis develops methods for reducing energy Measurement and Verification (M&V) costs through the use of Bayesian statistics. M&V quantifies the savings of energy efficiency and demand side projects by comparing the energy use in a given period to what that use would have been. had no interventions taken place. The case of a large-scale lighting retrofit study. where incandescent lamps are replaced by Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs). is considered. These projects often need to be monitored over a number of years with a predetermined level of statistical rigour. making M&V very expensive. M&V lighting retrofit projects have two interrelated uncertainty components that need to be addressed. and which form the basis of this thesis. The first is the uncertainty in the annual energy use of the average lamp. and the second the persistence of the savings over multiple years. determined by the number of lamps that are still functioning in a given year. For longitudinal projects. the results from these two aspects need to be obtained for multiple years. This thesis addresses these problems by using the Bayesian statistical paradigm. Bayesian statistics is still relatively unknown in M&V. and presents an opportunity for increasing the efficiency of statistical analyses. especially for such projects. After a thorough literature review. especially of measurement uncertainty in M&V. and an introduction to Bayesian statistics for M&V. three methods are developed. These methods address the three types of uncertainty in M&V: measurement. sampling. and modelling. The first method is a low-cost energy meter calibration technique.

The composites were fabricated through direct mixing of the ceramic particles and the liquid metal. Wear experiments were carried out in a pin–on–disk machine. under a load of 2 N and at a sliding speed of 6 cm/s. The static counterparts were 6 mm diameter steel balls. and the wear radio was 5 mm. The morphology of the wear track was examined by scanning electron microscopy. The tribological behavior of these materials are analyzed with the help of theoretical models and compared to previous experimental results. As found in previous studies. the wear performance increases with the particle size and volume fraction.

For overcast or cloudy days. recent studies propose the use of a set position in which each photovoltaic panel faces toward the zenith (horizontal position). Compared to a panel that follows the sun’s path. this approach claims that a horizontal panel increases the amount of solar radiation captured and subsequently the quantity of electricity produced.

The second coil model is discretized along the flow direction. the properties are updated along the coil and the velocity. enthalpy and pressure field are calculated. Both heat exchanger models are steady state and the axial diffusion heat transfer in the storage tank is transient. The novelty here is that the second exchanger model accounts for supercritical and two-phase CO2 flow in the pipe immersed in the reservoir.

1325304,Modélisation et mesures expérimentales sur un collecteur solaire hybride PV/T couplé à une pompe à chaleur au CO2,2019,Pierre-Luc Paradis,,,,,,De façon générale. les recherches sur l’énergie solaire sont justifiées par les problématiques environnementales et socioéconomiques issues de la prépondérance du trio fossile dans le mix énergétique mondial. Le Québec possède toutefois des particularités qui le distinguent au niveau énergétique tel que la disponibilité d’énergie électrique non polluante d’origine hydraulique. Le présent projet porte sur une meilleure utilisation de cette électricité par le couplage d’une pompe à chaleur au CO2 avec des collecteurs solaires photovoltaïques/thermiques. En effet. les pompes à chaleur sont plus efficaces que les plinths électriques typiquement employées pour le chauffage résidentiel au Québec. De plus. le CO2 fait partie des réfrigérants naturels qui possèdent un potentiel de réchauffement climatique inférieur à celui des réfrigérants typiquement utilisés dans les pompes à chaleur. Ses avantages environnementaux le rendent donc moins vulnérable au durcissement de la réglementation.  Au cours de ce projet. un banc d’essai permettant la comparaison de trois types de collecteurs solaires a été développé. De plus. ce banc d’essai comporte une pompe à chaleur transcritique au CO2 qui utilise les collecteurs solaires comme évaporateur à expansion directe. La chaleur extraite des collecteurs solaires est rejetée dans la boucle d’eau mitigée de l’École de technologie supérieure de Montréal alors que les collecteurs solaires sont installés sur le toit.

Three different solar absorber plates are compared: a standard PV plate. a hybrid PV/T plate and a solar thermal absorber plate. The solar absorber plate embeds monocrystalline silicon PV cells. A serpentine stainless steel tube is bonded to the back of the solar absorber plate and two-phase CO 2 flows within it. The evaporation of the CO 2 gathers thermal energy from the solar absorber plate and helps to reduce the operating temperature of the PV cells. hence maintaining their electrical performance. The overall efficiency of the hybrid photovoltaic/thermal solar evaporator can reach 60.5% on a sunny day in Montreal.

Rousse,,Vecteur Environnement,,,,L’énergie solaire a connu une période de forte popularité à la suite du choc pétrolier de 1973. Toutefois. après le succès du développement et de l’intégration des technologies solaires dans les années 1980. ces dernières ont connu un déclin alimenté par le retour à la disponibilité des combustibles fossiles abordables. Depuis ce temps. l’engouement pour l’énergie solaire thermique et ses applications au Canada demeure faible malgré plusieurs projets de démonstration ayant fait leurs preuves. À titre d’exemple. la communauté solaire de Drake Landing située à Okotoks en Alberta (Drake Landing Solar Community. 2007) couvre presque entièrement ses besoins d’eau chaude domestique et de chauffage des espaces à l’aide de l’énergie solaire thermique.LA RESSOURCE SOLAIRE AU QUÉBEC En moyenne. le sud du Québec est autant sinon davantage ensoleillé que l’Allemagne.

Elle repose principalement sur l’utilisation des combustibles fossiles ce qui entraîne diverses problématiques notamment au niveau environnemental et socio-économique. Au Canada. c’est 80% de l’énergie du secteur résidentiel qui est utilisée sous forme de chaleur que ce soit pour le chauffage des maisons ou de l’eau domestique. Cette chaleur pourrait être adéquatement fournie par des collecteurs solaires thermiques qui convertissent le rayonnement solaire en chaleur. Malgré les nombreux collecteurs solaires disponibles sur le marché. différents défis restent à relever en lien avec les rigueurs du climat canadien.  L’objectif principal de ce projet vise à développer un collecteur solaire à tubes sous vide chauffant de l’air adapté aux conditions climatiques nordiques du Canada. De façon générale. les besoins et les spécifications auxquels le prototype doit répondre ont été établis. Par la suite. trois concepts de collecteur ont été développés. Le premier utilise les tubes sous vide standard en forme d’éprouvette. Le second se base sur une nouvelle technologie de tubes sous vide ouvert aux deux extrémités. Finalement. le dernier utilise la technologie des tubes caloducs. Sur la base de critères définis par les besoins et spécifications. les concepts ont été évalués et c’est le collecteur à tubes sous vide ouvert aux deux extrémités qui a été retenu.

1325320,Il recupero energetico ambientale del costruito,2010,Pietromaria Davoli,,,,,,Vi è una questione di crescente rilevanza che si presenta sempre più spesso nell’attività dei progettisti: come e quando recuperare un patrimonio edilizio esistente. caratterizzato talvolta da un importante significato storico-culturale. ma anche da prestazioni energetiche ed ambientali inefficienti?  È importante sottolineare come l’involucro dell’edificio. largamente responsabile del comportamento energetico. rappresenti anche l’aspetto in grado di connotare fortemente il tessuto urbano delle diverse realtà geografiche. Ogni intervento di recupero e riqualificazione non può quindi prescindere dalle caratteristiche tipologiche e tecnologiche legate alla tradizione edilizia locale: il progetto deve dialogare con esse e deve adottare soluzioni tecniche a impatto ridotto o nullo sulla consistenza originale dell’edificio. pur apportando un miglioramento prestazionale con significative ricadute sulle condizioni di comfort interno e sulle possibilità di uno sviluppo sostenibile.  Scopo del volume è mostrare molteplici strategie nel settore dell’efficienza energetica e della sostenibilità ambientale per il recupero e la riqualificazione del costruito. sia con valore storico testimoniale. sia di più recente costruzione.

In this study. the hygrothermal assessment of an internally thermal insulated masonry wall of an historic palace located in Ferrara. in Italy. is shown. In situ non-destructive monitoring method is combined with a hygrothermal simulation tool. aiming to better analyse and discuss future refurbishment scenarios. In this context. the original U-value of the wall (not refurbished) is decreased from 1.44 W/m 2 K to 0.26 W/m 2 K (10 cm stone wool). Under the site specific conditions of this wall. not reached by the sun or rain. it was verified that even in the absence of vapour barrier. no frost damage is likely to occur and the condensation risk is very limited. Authors proposed further discussion based on simulation. The results showed that the introduction of a second gypsum board to the studied technology compensated such absence. while the reduction of the insulation material thickness provides a reduction of RH peaks in the interstitial area by 1%; this second solution proved to be more efficient. providing a 3% RH reduction and the avoidance of further thermal losses.

New materials. technologies and processes belonging to industrial production may open innovative scenarios for the recovery and regeneration of the existing building heritage. especially in situations of emergencies due to natural disasters. social disorder and conflicting events. The reproduction of individual components or entire building portions is now facilitated by the coordinated use of 3D digital survey tools with modelling software and 3D printing machines. The latter technology has recently been applied also on the architectural scale. with the aim of defining new design and constructive scenarios. In the field of the recovery of existing buildings. research must focus in particular on the identification of reversible matrices (new punctual or spread insertions) for the elimination of gaps. They can be filled with solutions in analogy with the historical building or with an independent language. by using suitable materials. which do not alter the historical value of the building.

1325328,Instruments for the Calculation of Energy Performance in Historical Buildings. Limits of Applicability and Tuning Proposal,2014,Marta Calzolari and Pietromaria Davoli,1,,,108-114,,This research starts from the hypothesis that the two types of calculation available today (analytical standardized method and simplified method) present some limits of applicability. in particular if used for the evaluation of historical architecture. which has technical. geometric. and architectural characteristics that differ significantly from the ones of modern buildings. The use of non-specialized instruments can lead to errors in the calculation of the residual energetic performance of historical buildings. This calculation error can consequently lead to choices of intervention that can be harmful to the conservation of the building. to the final level of comfort of its interior. or to the resulting energy efficiency. This study critically analyses the current methods of calculating energy efficiency. with the purpose of verifying their validity and limits of applicability. by testing them on a sample of historic buildings. This analysis shows significant differences between the results obtained by the analytical method. taken as reference. and the calculations made with the simplified system.

The paper presents the results of two studies that Architettura>Energia Research Centre of the Department of Architecture of Ferrara accomplished for Public Administrations as instrument for sustainable reconstructive interventions in areas with very complex environmental. social. economic and historic aspects. The two locations considered are Caporciano. a small town within the area around L’Aquila struck by the earthquake in 2009 and now only partially inhabited; and Apice Vecchia. near Benevento. damaged by two earthquakes in 1962 and 1980. which forced the population to settle a new town in the vicinity. The proposed procedure is structured into two phases. The first consists of a preliminary on-site survey aimed at simplifying the acquisition of a large amount of data. which will facilitate a subsequent in depth survey focused on the energy and environmental characteristics of the towns. Data are analysed after the survey to establish dimensional parameters useful for energy simulation and for setting-up a database of building technologies and materials. used to calculate the energy performance index of the envelope for the current winter heating and summer cooling of the towns. During the second phase of the study. intervention strategies are developed to improve energy and environmental conditions of the urban system. depending on residual performance of technical elements. building’s function. historic value and earthquake damage …,True,oSWyeSsAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,5,https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/27288,15984684752980726532,/scholar?cites=15984684752980726532,,,https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/27288/ECSEE2013_proceedings_Boarin-Davoli.pdf?sequence=6&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Risultano successivamente posti in risalto alcuni indirizzi per un corretto approccio metodologico-operativo. venendo affrontate in maggior dettaglio le prime due strategie possibili di una serie di sette che continua in questa seconda parte.

Italy has defined a strategic plan for the improvement of the energy performance of its building heritage. To achieve the 2020 targets. renovation has to start first and foremost by the good example set by the Public Administration. especially through wide energy screening of its building stock and specific retrofit actions. However the Public Administration has to manage a very diverse building stock characterized also by several historical buildings. currently excluded from intervention programs by legitimate derogations. The numerical consistency. the role and the architectural value of these historical buildings require anyway involving them in strategic plans. For this reason. after outlining a framework of existing legislation. especially regarding measures proposed for public properties. the paper proposes some guidance and support action instruments to enhance the energy efficiency of historical buildings.A seguito del recepimento delle normative europee sull’efficienza energetica. l’Italia ha definito un piano strategico per il miglioramento del comportamento energetico del proprio patrimonio edilizio.

Large electricity consumers' interest in participating in these markets is growing as they see an opportunity to make profits by selling flexibility of consumption. Time margins for shifting part of the scheduled consumption often exist. and they can be used to provide said flexibility. But if the schedule is not designed to support these shifts. delaying the execution of a job may cause infeasibility problems (e.g. related to safety constraints). In this paper. the problem of calculating flexible schedules is tackled with a robust optimization based approach. For this purpose a new explicit robust counterpart is developed.

For instance. we address uncertainty on the start times chosen for the tasks or on which unit they are to be executed. Delays and unit outages are possible causes for such events and can be very common in practice. Through our approach. we can accommodate them without altering the remainder of the schedule.

1325347,A piezoresistive microcantilever array for chemical sensing applications,2007,Arnab Choudhury,,,,,,Numerous applications in the present day ranging from testing humidity in air to detecting miniscule quantities of potentially hazardous chemical and biological agents in the air or water supplies require the development of chemical sensors capable of analyte detection with high sensitivity and selectively. Further. it has become desirable to create lab-on-chip systems that can detect multiple chemical agents and allow for sampling and testing of environments at locations distant from conventional laboratory facilities. Current challenges in this area include design. development and characterization of low detection limit sensors. development of low-noise readout methods. positive identification of analytes and. identification and reduction of the effect of various noise sources - both intrinsic and extrinsic to the sensor.   The current work examines the performance limits of a 10-cantilever piezoresistive microcantilever array (PµCA) sensor. The microcantilevers measure analyte concentration in terms of the surface stress associated with analyte binding to the functionalized cantilever surface.  The design. fabrication. characterization and testing of this measurement platform is presented. A novel aspect of the sensors developed is the use of n-type doping which increases the sensitivity of the device by one order of magnitude. In addition. design rules for surface stress-based chemical sensors have been developed. Extensive thermal characterization of the piezoresistive microcantilevers has been performed for DC and AC electrical excitation and values of heat transfer coefficient for the associated microscale phenomena are reported.

Each frequency is manipulated independently by means of a PLL-based control loop which comprises a digital averaging phase detector that combines the two most crucial tasks. namely the phase shift measurement and the frequency separation. The properties of the controller are designed individually for each mode using a linearized model of the control system. The method is applicable to all kinds of oscillators where frequencies near the structure’s natural frequencies are to be controlled. To validate the results experimentally. the controller is implemented on a digital signal processor (DSP) and applied to a torsional oscillator.

Performing an optimization over open loop control inputs in such circumstances is known to lead to conservative input choices. leading to poor performance or even a failure to find a feasible input sequence. However. this conservativeness can be reduced by including recourse in the problem formulation. For linear systems with bounded disturbances. optimization over control laws that are affine in the disturbance measurements has emerged as a valid trade-off between performance and computational expense.

Vehicle trajectories are coupled through interactions at shared areas. including intersections and road segments. A motion model is presented that includes the combined trajectories of all vehicles. The trajectories are optimised for travel time by solving a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that incorporates constraints to ensure collision avoidance. To improve the computation time of solving the MILP. two model modifications are introduced related to interactions: 1) The use of binary variables is reduced by grouping them at targeted travel times. 2) The relative travel order of interacting vehicles is constrained. guided by a heuristic solver. To further reduce computation time. an iterative method solves a sequence of smaller MILPs by targeting essential vehicle interactions with an algorithm that predicts interactions. Experiments are run on a simulated road network based on a real surface mine and haul truck trips. The proposed MILP methods are shown to significantly reduce solution costs compared to a reactive approach based on common driving practices. The MILP modifications significantly reduce computation time. trading off marginal solution quality.

1325369,Numerical modeling of wet steam flow in steam turbine channel,2012,Hasril Hasini and Mohd Zamri Yusoff and Norhazwani Abd Malek,,,,,,In power station practice. work is extracted from expanding steam in three stages namely High Pressure (HP). Intermediate Pressure (IP) and Low Pressure (LP) turbines. During the expansion process in the LP turbine. the steam cools down and at some stages. it nucleates to become a two-phase mixture. It is well-acknowledged in the literature that the nucleating and wet stages in steam turbines are less efficient compared to those running with superheated steam. With the advent of water-cooled nuclear reactor. the problem becomes more prominent due to the fact that in water-cooled nuclear reactor. the steam generated is in saturated condition. This steam is then supplied to the HP steam turbine which therefore has also to operate on wet steam. One of the tangible problems associated with wetness is erosion of blading. The newly nucleated droplets are generally too small to cause erosion damage but some of the droplets are collected by the stator and rotor blades to form films and rivulets on the blade and casing walls. On reaching the trailing edges or the tips of the blades. the liquid streams are re-entrained into the flow in the form of coarse droplets. It is these larger droplets that cause the erosion damage and braking loss in steam turbine. However. the formation and behaviour of the droplets have other important thermodynamic and aerodynamic consequences that lower the performance of the wet stages of steam turbines.Interest in wet steam research was sparked by the need for efficient steam turbines used in power generation.

Universiti Malaysia Pahang,Temperature variations inside a car underhood are largely controlled by the heat originating from the engine block and the exhaust manifold. Excessive temperatures in the underhood can lead to the faster deterioration of engine components and may affect the thermal comfort level inside the passenger cabin. This paper presents computational fluid dynamics investigations to assess the performance of a heat shield in lowering the peak temperature of the engine components and firewall in the underhood region of a typical passenger car. The simulation used the finite volume method with the standard k-ε turbulence model and an isothermal model for the heat transfer calculations. The results show that the heat shield managed to reduce the peak temperature of the engine components and firewall by insulating the intense heat from the engine block and exhaust and regulating the airflow inside the underhood region.,True,GghTQEsAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,6,http://ijame.ump.edu.my/images/Volume%206/10%20%20Lam%20et%20al.pdf,2388231502665708431,/scholar?cites=2388231502665708431,,,http://ijame.ump.edu.my/images/Volume%206/10%20%20Lam%20et%20al.pdf,0,0,0

In general. the main objective of using the winglet longitudinal vortex-generators with the corrugated surfaces is to obtain an increase in the rate of heat exchange by generating vortex and reverse flow which in turn increases the efficiency of the thermal process. leading to save operating costs. To achieve this purpose. four amplitude heights are introduced: a= 1. 2. 3 and 4 mm. Furthermore. the arrangement of winglet longitudinal vortex-generator is placed at the entrance of each wave existing with the same as the slant angle of the waves in the trapezoidal channel. A constant heat flux is adopted to be the thermal condition for the lower and upper corrugated walls while the Reynolds numbers (Re) rate is in the range of 5.000 to 17.500. The effects of the trapezoidal amplitude heights with winglets longitudinal vortex-generator are studied and compared using the non-dimensional parameter performance evaluation criteria (PEC).

The effects of two parameters. namely the Reynolds number and the blockage ratio. are the main focus for this study. The threedimensional flow is simulated where the circular cylinder is placed symmetrically in a planar channel with a blockage ratio of β= 0.5 at Re= 200. 300 and 500. Quantitative analysis of the flow is conducted where the lift. CL and drag coefficient. CD and Strouhal number. St are investigated as β and Re are systematically varied. In the present study. it is found that different instability regimes are observed as the Re of the flow increases. The presence of a distinct shedding frequency is observed at Re= 200. However. increasing the Reynolds number further. the contribution of a range of frequencies surrounding the peak frequency appears as shown in the spectral analysis of the lift coefficient.

First estimates using a HTGR presently constructed in China (HTR-PM) conclude that a concentration of approximately 80 mg/kg U in PR is sufficiently high for energy neutral wet acid PR processing with waste treatment and a concentration of approximately 110 mg/kg U is adequate to promote energy intensive high quality thermal phosphoric acid production.

The anticipated growth in nuclear energy may require introducing uranium and thorium from unconventional resources (eg phosphates. coal ash. sea water and rare earth ores) as a future fuel.

This shifts the global production to lowgrade. or in certain cases unconventional mineral resources. the production of which is constrained by large-scale energy availability.

The arenaceous Shillong formation constituting conglomerates and quartzites rests over the Tyrsad formation with a pronounced unconformity. The rocks of Tyrsad formation are intensely deformed and show regional metamorphic effects of almandine-amphibolite grade and subsequent retrogression to greenschist facies. whereas the Shillong formation conglomerates and quartzites are comparatively flat bedded. gently folded. and weakly metamorphosed.

Since 2001. wind power has been growing at a phenomenal rate of 20% to 30% per annum. Wind power (2 016 GW) is expected to provide 12% of the global electricity by 2050. thereby avoiding annually 2.8 gigatonnes of emissions of CO2 equivalent. This would need an investment of USD 3.2 trillion during 2010–2050.

Wind turbines do not need gusty winds; they need only moderate but steady winds. Wind turbines start producing electricity when the wind speed reaches 18–25km/hr (5 to 7 m/s). reaching their rated output when the wind speed reaches about 47 km/hr (13 m/s). So any area where the wind speeds are greater than about 18 km/hr (5 m/s) is suitable for …,True,wWpISaoAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18045405784109372437&hl=en&oi=scholarr,18045405784109372437,/scholar?cites=18045405784109372437,,,,0,0,0

This report is a sequel to “Analysis of Uranium Supply to 2050”. published in 2001. Many changes to demand. supply and prices have occurred since that publication. including: complete suspension of operations within the Japanese fleet of nuclear reactors; conclusion of the Russian–US HEU agreement under which some 20.000 Russian nuclear warheads were converted into nuclear fuel; and significant uranium price volatility. ie< USD 23/Kg U (< USD 9.00/lb U3O8) in 2001.> USD 338/Kg U (> USD 130/lb U3O8) in 2007 and< USD 104/Kg U (< USD 40/lb U3O8) in 2013. U2060 incorporates these changes.U2060 sets forth three demand cases that project reactor uranium requirements from 2010 to 2060. The middle or “reference” demand case forecasts moderate worldwide economic growth. accompanied by a modest growth in nuclear power that averages 1.8% per year. The high demand case envisions strong economic growth with accelerated growth in nuclear power averaging 2.4% per year. while the low demand case assumes that nuclear power will grow only slightly during the forecast period. It seems unlikely. at this time. that nuclear power would be phased out to any substantial degree within the foreseeable future. U2060 reviews the supply sources that are expected to be available to meet reactor uranium demand through to 2060.

1325435,Zero standby solutions with optical energy harvesting from a laser pointer,2018,Daniel L Gerber and Alan Meier and Robert Hosbach and Richard Liou,7,Electronics,11,292,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Despite recent efforts to reduce standby power consumption in plug loads. new trends in the miniaturization and wide distribution of electronics necessitates devices with zero standby consumption. This work introduces two zero standby solutions that wake a device using an external input of energy harvested from a 5 mW laser pointer. These solutions are applicable to electronics that are remotely activated or have a fiber optic connection. The first utilizes a cascoded header switch to allow for simultaneous low-voltage harvesting and high-voltage blocking. The second involves the use of a charge pump to boost the harvested voltage to a level appropriate for the gate of a high-voltage switch. Prototypes for each method are developed in order to demonstrate functionality and identify the associated benefits and drawbacks. The results show that combining the two methods allows for optimal activation range (up to 25 m) and component count.

1325440,Adaptive transmit beamforming for simultaneous transmit and receive,2011,Daniel L Gerber,,,,,,Simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) is an important problem in the field of communications. Engineers have researched many different models and strategies that attempt to solve this problem. One such strategy is to place a transmit-side null at the receiver in order to decouple a system's transmitter and receiver. thus allowing them to operate simultaneously. This thesis discusses the use of gradient based adaptive algorithms to allow for transmit beamforming. Several such algorithms are devised. simulated. and compared in performance. Of these. the best is chosen to study in further detail. A mathematical analysis is performed on this particular algorithm to determine a linearized state space model. which is then used in a noise analysis. An important benefit of these algorithms is that they do not require computationally intensive matrix operations such as inversion or eigen-decomposition. This thesis ultimately provides. explains. and analyzes a viable method that can form a transmit-side null at the receiver and extract a weak signal of interest from the received signal while simultaneously transmitting another signal at high power.,True,IDJFxmIAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,4,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/66418,17715039361056202791,/scholar?cites=17715039361056202791,,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/66418/755092701-MIT.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Modern buildings contain hundreds of these devices which. together. are responsible for at least 25 percent of the energy use in California buildings. Energy consumed by plug loads is increasing because the “Internet of Things” is. to a great extent. the “Internet of Plug Loads.” This project developed technologies that will reduce the energy use of plug loads. Two crosscutting strategies were investigated in detail: (1) technologies to reduce standby power use to near zero. and (2) methods to increase the use of direct current (DC) as a power source. Two new approaches to reduce standby to near zero were developed and have potential applicability to a wide range of devices. Prototype DC appliances were developed to demonstrate energy savings by bypassing power supplies and avoiding other losses. Networks of DC-powered devices can save even more energy and provide other benefits. such as resiliency during power outages. A unique category of energy-using devices was identified that provide life safety. health. and security to building occupants. Their installation or use is dictated by building codes. health providers. insurance companies. and other entities—none of whom would ordinarily prioritize energy efficiency. In the case of ground fault circuit interrupts (GFCIs). savings of 80 percent appear possible. simply by adopting the most efficient designs.

Golden. CO (United States),With the increasing availability of Direct Current (DC) power from on-site solar systems. building designers now have the option of direct distribution of DC power to energy storage systems and end-use loads such as lighting. electronics. and motors. Research shows that direct-DC can reduce building distribution losses by 5-15%. while improving power reliability. A readily available way to implement direct-DC distribution is Power over Ethernet (PoE). which typically has provided low-voltage DC to power office equipment such as WiFi access points. With recent updates to the PoE standard. equipment such as network-controlled LED lighting. thin client and computer workstations. HVAC controllers. fans. motors. and actuators can now be powered by PoE and are commercially available. This paper presents results from a DOE-funded project that is demonstrating PoE technologies and describes a DC modeling and design tool that is intended to help building designers properly evaluate and design DC distribution systems in buildings.

1325459,Scaling of solutal convection in porous media,2017,Yu Liang,,,,,,Convective dissolution trapping is an important mechanism for CO₂ mitigation because of its high security and long-term storage capacity. This process is a problem of solutal convection in porous media. which is a classic example of symmetry breaking and pattern formation. The convective solute flux and geometry of the convective pattern are thought to be controlled by the molecular Rayleigh number. Raₘ. i.e.. the ratio of the buoyant driving forces over diffusive dissipation. The dimensionless convective solute flux. Sh (Sherwood number). is thought to increase with Raₘ approximately linearly. as Sh ~ Raₘ. The spacing of the convective fingers. δ. relative to the domain height. H. is thought to decrease approximately as [mathematical equation]. However. there is little experimental verification of these fundamental scaling laws for solutal convection in porous media. To understand the controlling physics of CO₂ convective dissolution in aquifers and verify relevant fundamental scaling laws. I conduct convective dissolution experiments using analog fluids in a porous medium. By changing the controlling parameters. including permeability and maximum density difference. corresponding convective velocity. dissolution flux. and finger pattern are measured for each combination. The experimental results shows that these fundamental scaling laws do not hold for the experiments in porous media composed of glass beads. Instead. I observe that the dissolution flux levels off as Raₘ increases and that the finger spacing increases rather than decreases with increasing Raₘ. The classic scaling analysis breaks down because it does not consider the …,True,Il5NDS8AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,9,https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/68164,11473084001103445260,/scholar?cites=11473084001103445260,,,https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/68164/LIANG-DISSERTATION-2017.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

1325461,Experimental study of convective dissolution of carbon dioxide in porous media,2014,Yu Liang,,,,,,Geological carbon dioxide (CO₂) capture and storage in geological formations has the potential to reduce anthropogenic emissions. The viability of technology depends on the long-term security of the geological CO₂ storage. Dissolution of CO₂ into the brine. resulting in stable stratification. has been identified as the key to long-term storage security. The dissolution rate determined by convection in the brine is driven by the increase of brine density with CO₂ saturation. Here we present a new analog laboratory experiment system to characterize convective dissolution in homogeneous porous medium. By understanding the relationship between dissolution and the Rayleigh number in homogeneous porous media. we can evaluate if convective dissolution occurs in the field and. in turn. to estimate the security of geological CO₂ storage fields. The large experimental assembly will allow us to quantify the relationship between convective dynamics and the Rayleigh number of the system. which could be essential to trapping process at Bravo Dome. A series of pictures with high resolution are taken to show the existence and movement of fingers of analog fluid.  Also. these pictures are processed. clearly showed the concentration of analog fluid. which is essential to analyze the convective dissolution in detail.

1325526,Case Studies in Thermal Engineering,2016,Taoufik Brahim and Abdelmajid Jemni,,,,,,Nanofluids have been receiving increased attention worldwide and various research groups have tried to engage it within heat pipes systems to study the subsequent thermal enhancement. The observations based on the reviewed literature showed that the theoretical investigations on nanofluids in heat pipes are very few and hence validating the experimental findings is difficult.In this paper. a two-dimensional numerical model is developed to study the thermal performance of a packed sphere heat pipe utilizing nanofluids due to the recent development of nanofluids and porous media structures. Two of the most common nanoparticles. namely Al2O3 and CuO based water are considered. The substantial change in the heat pipe thermal resistance. liquid pressure. axial and radial velocities profiles in presence of suspended nanoparticles within the base fluid are discussed. The effect of particle size on the thermal performance of the heat pipe is also investigated. Results showed that Al2O3 nanofluid slightly outperformed CuO nanofluid heat pipes especially with decreasing nanofluid particle diameter. It was found that reduction of 68% on thermal resistance can be obtained for 9% CuO nanofluid concentration level which trend to reach 20% without significant shear stress effect. Nanofluid based heat pipe is able to dissipate up to 26% more heat without experiencing an increase in the wall temperature and an optimal nanofluid concentration level and diameter are found to better heat pipe performance.,True,lxzTCxcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/684472.pdf,,,,,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/684472.pdf,0,0,0

In this way. the cost and trouble of installing many measurement devices over numerous household appliances can be avoided. and only one device needs to be installed. The problem has been well-known since Hart’s seminal paper in 1992. and recently significant performance improvements have been achieved by adopting deep networks. In this work. we focus on the idea that appliances have on/off states. and develop a deep network for further performance improvements. Specifically. we propose a subtask gated network that combines the main regression network with an on/off classification subtask network. Unlike typical multitask learning algorithms where multiple tasks simply share the network parameters to take advantage of the relevance among tasks. the subtask gated network multiply the main network’s regression output with the subtask’s classification probability. When standby-power is additionally learned. the proposed solution surpasses the state-of-the-art performance for most of the benchmark cases.

Although this technology was developed in 1992. its practical usage and mass deployment have been rather limited. possibly because the commonly used datasets are not adequate for NILM research. In this study. we report the findings from a newly collected dataset that contains 10 Hz sampling data for 58 houses. The dataset not only contains the aggregate measurements. but also individual appliance measurements for three types of appliances. By applying three classification algorithms (vanilla DNN (Deep Neural Network). ML (Machine Learning) with feature engineering. and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with hyper-parameter tuning) and a recent regression algorithm (Subtask Gated Network) to the new dataset. we show that NILM performance can be significantly limited when the data sampling rate is too low or when the number of distinct houses in the dataset is too small. The well-known NILM datasets that are popular in the research community do not meet these requirements.

The experiment was a reward setup with daily feedback delivered by an energy delegate for one week. and energy saving of 25.4% was achieved during the experiment. Post-experiment sustainability. defined as 10% or more of energy saving. was also accomplished for 44 days without any further intervention efforts. The saving was possible mainly because of the data-driven intervention designs with high-resolution data in terms of sampling frequency and number of sensors. and the high-resolution data turned out to be pivotal for an effective waste behavior investigation. While the quantitative result was encouraging. we also noticed many uncontrollable factors. such as exams. papers due. office allocation shuffling. graduation. and new-comers. that affected the result in the campus environment. To confirm that the quantitative result was due to behavior changes. rather than uncontrollable factors. we developed several data-driven behavior detection measures. With these measures. it was possible to analyze behavioral changes. as opposed to simply analyzing quantitative fluctuations. Overall. we conclude that the space-time resolution of data can be crucial for energy saving. and potentially for many other data-driven energy applications.

1325546,NUMERICAL APPROXIMATION OF OPTION PRICING MODEL UNDER JUMP DIFFUSION USING THE LAPLACE TRANSFORMATION METHOD.,2011,Hyoseop Lee and Dongwoo Seen,8,International Journal of Numerical Analysis & Modeling,4,,,The Black-Scholes formula [3]. introduced by Black and Scholes in 1973. has been adopted as a standard framework for option pricing. particularly due to its closed form solution. However. the difficulty in capturing a large or sudden movement of an underlying asset has been pointed out as a major drawback of the Black-Scholes formula. Practitioners and theorists have tried to extend the model of the underlying to tackle this phenomena. and among them the implementation of jumpdiffusion processes has become one of the most popular tools. In the pioneering work of Merton [23]. he modeled the underlying assets using a Brownian motion with drift having jumps arriving accordingly as a compound Poisson process. In [16]. Kou tried to explain high peaks and heavy tails in asset return distributions incorporating with the volatility smile by proposing a double exponential jump diffusion model. These jump-diffusion processes are considered as specific examples of Lévy processes with stationary independent increments. and have been applied intensively to improve option modeling. For further details. for instance. readers are referred to the book by Cont and Tankov [6] and the references therein. To evaluate the value of the option modeled by jump-diffusion process. one needs to solve a PIDE (partial integro-differential equation) of parabolic type that contains both partial differential operators and a non-local integral term. Several attempts have been tried to reduce the expensive computational cost of solving the PIDE. Most of such attempts may be roughly classified into two types.

Modeling with Machine Learning and Credit Scoring,2017,Kyungeun Lee and Eunjung Lee and Hyesu Lee and Hyoseop Lee and Yoonjin Yoon and Wonjong Rhee,,,,,,In this study. we consider a residential DR program of incentive-based peak power reduction where invitation for participation can be sent selectively. The selective process can be crucial for improving efficiency of the program for two reasons. First. there are customers who do not change their behavior at all but take rewards due to the natural variations in their life patterns. Second. too many notifications can cause adversarial effects where participants turn off the notification channels or make complaint calls. For the selective process. obviously the process needs to be made as efficient as possible. but it is also essential to maximize the explainability of the selection process such that the operation of the program can be made smooth. To address this problem. we propose a customer participation behavior prediction model considering both accuracy and explainability. where the accuracy advantage of Machine Learning (ML) and the explainability advantage of Credit Scoring (CS) are combined. For the study. data was collected from 15.091 households in Korea for one year in 2016. ML algorithms. with up to 56 features. were studied and showed a fairly high prediction performance (AUROC 0.9576). but they were too complicated to satisfy explainability. A CS method of classing with a scorecard was adopted. where its explainability has been heavily tested and proven in the financial sector already.

The'demand response'programs can be used to complement the problems of renewable energies. and therefore their role is becoming increasingly important. This study provides an analysis of a demand response pilot that was conducted in Korea. The study first focused on questionnaire surveys and in-depth interviews. and the data was used to perform a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) analysis.

To enable further processing and achieve recovery of metals. separation should be selective. One separation technique. which can meet this requirement. is polymer-enhanced ultra filtration (PEUF). Ultra filtration membranes would only retain macromolecular solutes. PEUF uses water-soluble polymeric agents to complex easily interesting metallic ions and give them a macromolecular size. Binding of metal ions to water soluble polymers enables us to separate them from solution and retain them when they are pumped through an ultra filtration membrane. In the present work Polyetherimide (PEI) is used as water soluble polymer for removal of cadmium ions from waste water via hollow fiber membrane contactor module. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane contactor is used for this purpose. The PVDF fiber was custom made using thermal induced phase separation techniques. Experimental observations reveal that when PEI concentration increases the percentage removal of Cd (II) also increases. The molecular weight of PEI has positive impact on Cd (II) retention. The pH value of feed has effect on Cd (II) withholding. The percentage of removal increases with solution pH value. Recycling either retentate; the part of a solution that does not cross the membrane; or permeate have no effect on removal.

The major constituents of natural gas are CH4 and CO2. The absorption or stripping of carbon dioxide is an important task in the operation of gas-liquid membrane contacting processes. The removal of CO2 from natural gas prior to use is essential. The presence of CO2 reduces the heating value of the natural gas and causes pipe corrosion. The conventional absorption processes are packed columns. The packed towers are usually large in size. require high investment cost and suffer from several operational limitations include flooding. entrainment and foaming. Recently hollow fiber membrane contactor has attracted the attention of many researchers. Absorption of CO2 takes place in a membrane contactor when the gas stream contacts with the liquid phase flowing on the opposite side of the membrane.

The solvent-refined montan wax and the fractions were reacted under coal liquefaction conditions with H2. COH2O or N2 at 320 and 405°C. The effects of catalysts (SnO2 for H2 and NaAlO2 for COH2O reactions) were also studied. as well as possible catalytic effects of the stainless steel walls of the reactor. All reactions at 320°C gave little conversion to hydrocarbons. but at 405°C significant yields of hydrocarbons were found and these were greater for the reactions with H2 than for those with COH2O.

The crude Montan wax extracts were separated into asphalt. purified wax. resin. acid/alcohol and wax ester fractions using isopropanol and hot/cold ether. The purified Montan wax (acid/alcohol and wax esters) yield varied from 1.4% (Yallourn dark) to 13% (Rosedale 5 pale). with the elevated temperature/pressure conditions giving higher yields. An improved gas chromatographic method was developed to quantitate the ester. hydrocarbon and derivatised acid and alcohol content of the purified Montan waxes. The ester fraction was characterised and found to have carbon chain lengths between C{sub 46} and C{sub 60}.

Repeat extractions of the residue from the mild extraction under various conditions gave in some cases significant yields of alkali soluble product. The structure of these extracts tended to diverge from that of the genuine humic acid and approach that of whole coal after many extractions.

Pyrolysis/g.c. was found to be an excellent qualitative method of monitoring the extraction technique.

Energy shortages have attracted significant attention due to the shrinking availability of non-renewable resources. Therefore. thermal energy storage is one of the solutions that lead to saving of fossil fuels and make systems more cost-effective by the storage of wasted thermal energy. In particular. the application of phase change materials (PCMs) is considered as an effective and efficient approach to thermal energy storage because of the high latent heat storage capacity at small temperature intervals. Nevertheless. leakage problems and low thermal conductivity limit the practical applications of PCMs. Therefore. form-stable phase change materials with high thermal conductivity are urgently needed. A novel form-stable composite phase change material was prepared by incorporating PEG into waste sawdust with 5% EG. In the composites. PEG served as a phase change material. while waste sawdust acted as a carrier matrix. EG was added to help increase the thermal conductivity of the composites. The melting temperature of CPCMs-4 with 5% EG was found to be 58.6 °C with a phase change enthalpy of 145.3 kJ/kg. while the solidifying temperature was 48.5 °C with a phase change enthalpy of 131.4 kJ/kg. The thermal conductivity of CPCMs-4 with 5% EG increased by 23.8% compared with that of CPCMs-4.

To keep the control area secure and protected locally. mathematical singular entropy (MSE) based fault identification approach is utilized for fast discovery of faults in the control area. Simulation results with 27-bus and 486-bus power systems show that CS can reduce the data size up to 1/10th while the MSE-based fault identification technique can accurately …,True,91OsIQYAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,10,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8533417/,5309081932914345624,/scholar?cites=5309081932914345624,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04347,0,0,0
1325638,Hybrid control strategy for a semi active suspension system using fuzzy logic and bio-inspired chaotic fruit fly algorithm,2017,Vikram Bhattacharjee and Debanjan Chatterjee and Orkun Karabasoglu,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.08878,,,,This study proposes a control strategy for the efficient semi active suspension systems utilizing a novel hybrid PID-fuzzy logic control scheme. In the control architecture. we employ the Chaotic Fruit Fly Algorithm for PID tuning since it can avoid local minima by chaotic search. A novel linguistic rule based fuzzy logic controller is developed to aid the PID. A quarter car model with a non-linear spring system is used to test the performance of the proposed control approach. A road terrain is chosen where the comfort and handling parameters are tested specifically in the regions of abrupt changes. The results suggest that the suspension systems controlled by the hybrid strategy has the potential to offer more comfort and handling by reducing the peak acceleration and suspension distortion by 83.3% and 28.57% respectively when compared to the active suspension systems. Also. compared to the performance of similar suspension control strategies optimized by stochastic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GA). Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO). reductions in peak acceleration and suspension distortion are found to be 25%. 32.3%. 54.6% and 23.35%. 22.5%. 5.4% respectively.

However. it needs special techniques to measure voltage angle difference. which may enlarge the computational burden of the working controller and hence. may make the control process slow. In this paper. authors investigate the approximation of angle difference to zero and its effects on the convergence speed and optimal solutions of a distributed algorithm. To test this approximation. a distributed nonlinear algorithm is proposed to optimize the multi-objective function which includes power loss. voltage deviation and cost of reactive power generation. by controlling the reactive power generations from distributed generators.

1325648,Effects of Targeting Energy Subsidies on Domestic Electricity Demand in Iran,2017,F. Bazzazan and F. Ghashami and M. Mousavi,7,International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy,2,9-17,,The ever-increasing electricity consumption in Iran. mainly due to its low and. in fact. unrealistic price. has caused the nationwide power supply network to fail meeting the demand; therefore. optimizing its price is an important issue in the management of the electricity supply and demand. Domestic energy consumption is very high in the country making it a necessity to optimize it and study the consumer’s behavioral reaction towards the variations of the electricity price. Effort has been made in this paper to study the impact of the targeting of energy subsidies on domestic demand during 1991-2012 using the almost ideal demand system and seemingly unrelated regression estimation methods. Results have shown that electricity is an essential commodity for both urban and rural families; the absolute value of the price elasticity has been found to be less than unity for both. Results have also indicated that the consumption reaction against the price increase is not much. It is concluded. therefore. that mere energy pricing policies do not possibly suffice to reduce consumption; taking advantage of other supplementary policies. such as encouraging people to use lowconsumption efficient electric appliances. enhancing the public level of awareness and culture of correct consumption. and so on. is also necessary.

Bazzazan,,,,,,According to the APO (Asian Productivity Organization) report in 2008 production per capita in Iran has been experienced relatively well growth during last two decades. One of the reasons of this growth might relates to the total factor productivity growth that figures show slow rise at the macro level. To estimate the share of factor productivity requires more investigation on the source of the factor productivity growth at national. sectoral. and industry levels. Few investigations have been carried out on estimating total factor productivity growth at the national or manufacturing sector and excluded all sectors or industry levels. However. policy makers and economic planners are interested to know thoroughly the total factor productivity growth at sector or industry levels. To do so. the objective of this paper is to measure the growth of TFP by industries and the whole of the economy during 1988–2004 by using detailed sectoral data that are adjusted in order to account for input–output tables. Three input-output tables of Central Bank of Iran. 1988. 1999. and 2004 are going to be employed.

According to the 2015 report by Statistical Center of Iran (SCI 2015). with more than 3- million trips. Qom province ranked second of domestic tourists’ arrival among the twenty most important cities in the spring and summer of 2011. This paper measures the impact of domestic tourism expenditures on both output and employment in Qom province and the rest of the economy (the national economy excluding Qom province). using two-regional input-output approach.

1325661,THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES ON ELECTRICITY DEMAND AND CONSUMPTION FOR THE URBAN AND RURAL HOUSEHOLDS IN IRAN (A SYSTEMIC SOLUTION),2015,F. Bazzazan and M. Mousavi and F. Gheshomi,4,,14,1-32,IRANIAN ENERGY ECONOMICS,The continuous growth of electricity consumption in Iran. due to the low and unreasonable prices. has created immense pressure on the national network of supplying electricity to meet the ever-increasing demand. The realistic and economically justifiable pricing of electricity has. therefore. become an urgent issue for managing supply and demand. The residential electricity consumption in the country is one of the main sources of such demand increase. The present study focuses on the impacts of government subsidies on electricity demand and consumption for the urban and rural households in Iran. Data used for this study include price index. urban and rural household expenditures. provided by the Iranian Center for Statistics. Central Bank of Iran during the period 1991-2012. The study utilizes Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) and Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) estimation methods for data analyses. The results show that electricity is an essential good for both urban and rural households. and as such the demand and consumption levels for both urban and rural households in the country have very little (less than one) elasticity to prices. The conclusion is that the demand levels for residential electricity consumption are not meaningfully reduced by the price increase for customers created by elimination or reductions of governmental subsidies for electricity. Therefore. pricing policies alone would not be effective to reduce residential electricity consumption in the country. and there is a need for additional and supplemental policies.,True,nQv15JgAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,1,https://jiee.atu.ac.ir/article_1062.html?lang=en,8834716303950983357,/scholar?cites=8834716303950983357,,,https://jiee.atu.ac.ir/article_1062.html?lang=en,0,0,0

1325663,The Economic Importance of Housing Sector in Tehran Province-Extraction Method Approach,2011,Fatemeh Bazzazan and S Mohsenpour,,"The 19 th International Input-Output Conference, Alexandria, USA",,,,Tehran is the most important province of economic activities in Iran. More than one fourth of economic activities are located in Tehran province. There is the fact that financial resources are limited and huge investment are required in different economic sectors. policy makers and regional planners are looking for activities those can bring more growth or create more jobs. According to many studies housing sector is one of the main sectors. this paper study the relative importance of this sector. We apply Hypothetical Extraction Method (HEM). To do so. regional input-output table for Tehran is required. We used Tehran inputoutput table 2001 which has been provided by Bazzazan et. al.(2007). Table has been aggregated into 18 main economic sectors of the province in which construction sector is considered separately. The results demonstrate that housing sector cannot be deemed as the main key sector of the province. since the main productive portion of this sector has been absorbed by the final demand and has been excluded from the production cycle. As a result. the housing sector has a relatively low importance compared to other economic sectors of the province. The amount of reduction in total economic taken amounts of the province is very trivial in comparison with the past circumstances (less than one percent).,True,nQv15JgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1,https://www.academia.edu/download/4169254/522_20110428021_iopdf-14.docx.pdf,10788730478541569609,/scholar?cites=10788730478541569609,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/4169254/522_20110428021_iopdf-14.docx.pdf,0,0,0

For this purpose output multipliers and structural path analysis approaches in the social accounting matrix framework are employed. The most advantage of the structural path analysis is that provides a detailed technique of decomposing output multipliers and identifying a full network of path of economic influence from the origin sector to its ultimate destination. For this purpose main data bases are: the 2011 SAM of Parliament Research Center of Iran and the foreign inbound tourism revenue in 2017 in the absence of tourism satellite accounts in Iran. Results show foreign tourism revenue (28.2 thousands billion rials) has led to increased output of all economic sectors (62.1thousands billion rials). and total output multiplier is 2.31 unit. in which other services. wholesale and retail. and hotel sectors have received 13.71. 13.66. and 12.66 percent of the total output effects. respectively. The decomposition of output multiplier and structural path analysis results revealed that food. restaurant. road. rail and air transportation have the most direct paths and vice versa for the other related tourism sectors. Moreover. wholesale and retail. agriculture. road transportation. and other services play a significant role in influencing foreign tourists' incomes on the Iranian economy.

The emulsion preparation was performed in real time without using any surfactant. Instead of mechanically breaking the water down into droplets. the water is delivered thermally. by changing its phase from gas to liquid. Steam is used in this proposed process. where it will be converted into suspended water droplets once it meets colder diesel.

NWD needs to be supplied into the diesel engine or combustor as soon as it was formed. Since the combustion and emission performance are closely related to the water content of an emulsion fuel. the immediate water content of NWD needs to be more closely inspected. The ASTM D95 standard provides a method to determine the water content of an NWD. but this method takes a long time to perform (up to 2 hours) and arduous. This paper describes the estimation of water content in a non-surfactant emulsion fuel by bomb-calorimetry. which can deliver quicker results than ASTM distillation. Experiments were performed with samples of emulsion fuel using and void of surfactant.

Kyushu University,Most studies reported that smoke opacity and particulate matter (PM) are substantially reduced when using emulsion fuel. The goal of this work was to predict the PM reduction of diesel emulsion fuel by measuring the smoke opacity. which is known to be proportional with PM. The smoke/PM measurements were mostly of the particulate trap type. which is lengthy. arduous and only offers cumulative results. In this study. the smoke opacity was measured in real-time by using a smoke opacimeter to obtain faster. simpler and continuous results. The results were compared to the results of Legal Particulate Sampling (LPS). The types of fuel used in this study were an emulsion fuel denoted as E10 and Malaysian EURO2 diesel (D2M). Even though the PM emission of E10 was 20% lower than D2M. the smoke opacity of E10 was 200% higher. It was concluded that the opacimeter could not be used to predict the PM reduction in emulsified D2M.,True,g79N8lUAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,http://www.tj.kyushu-u.ac.jp/evergreen/contents/EG2020-7_3_content/pdf/Pages_452-457.pdf,,,,,http://www.tj.kyushu-u.ac.jp/evergreen/contents/EG2020-7_3_content/pdf/Pages_452-457.pdf,0,0,0

The SD was prepared using a custom 200 mL glass mixing column. The B5 fuel quantitatively was filled in the column. and then the steam was injected from the bottom of the mixing column through the porous frit glass with the pores ranging from 40 to 100 µm. The average water droplet size of SD is 0.375 µm with the average water percentage of 6.18%. The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of SD improved 4.19% and 3.92%. respectively. as compared to B5. The in-cylinder pressure (ICP) was lower than B5. however. yielding close to the B5 at 4 kW engine load. As for the exhaust emission test. NO x and PM for SD were reduced significantly with a percentage reduction of 25.22% and 10.68%. respectively. as compared to neat B5.

However. the current approach of producing W/D has its disadvantages in terms of cost and complexity. Therefore. a new approach to produce W/D is developed where water is introduced in vapour state. instead of as liquid. into the fuel. This new method may simplify the emulsion production process as it requires less mechanical parts than any previous non-surfactant emulsion forming methods. The objective of this study is to determine the physical characteristics of steam generated W/D and its engine emission. The characteristics to be determined include the size distribution of water droplets as well as water content.

These models are discussed with regards to three different slurry systems; particles in deionized water. in supporting electrolyte without redox active species (akin to electrochemical flow capacitors). and in electrolytes supporting aqueous redox couples (akin to redox flow batteries). Through investigating each of these systems. the individual properties of a slurry can be determined.

For the slurry electrode to perform effectively. the battery negative reaction must occur on the slurry particles at reasonably high current densities. Mathematical modeling is used to investigate the current distribution in a slurry electrode as a function of the slurry specific area and electrical conductivity in order to achieve >95% plating in the slurry electrode (not on the flat plate) at > 200 mA cm−2. From the mathematical modeling. MWCNTs are selected to demonstrate slurry electrode performance. The experimental performance of all-iron batteries charged using the MWCNT slurry electrodes is found to improve while increasing the battery state-of-charge.

The standard reduction potential of the iron II/0 reaction is at− 0.44 V vs. NHE. suggesting that hydrogen evolution could be a significant factor in coulombic losses on the negative electrode. Methods of increasing the coulombic efficiency of iron plating are considered. such as anion concentration and electrolyte additives. The use of a chloride anion containing electrolyte showed less hydrogen evolution rates and faster plating kinetics than an electrolyte containing the same concentration of sulfate anions.

1325710,Enhancing the capacity of all-iron flow batteries: understanding crossover and slurry electrodes,2015,Tyler Joseph Petek,,,,,,Flow batteries have been studied for grid-scale energy storage applications because their capacity and power delivery rate can be independently scaled. The all iron flow battery is particularly attractive because iron. the only active species. is low cost. abundant. and environmentally benign. With conventional electrodes. the capacity is severely limited and coupled to the power rating because the negative electrode involves iron metal. The available capacity is further reduced by ferric ions transferring across the separator from the positive to the negative electrode where they react with iron metal causing chemical self discharge of the battery. In order to enhance the capacity of the all iron flow battery. the use of slurry electrodes to decouple capacity from the power rating and the self discharge by active species crossover are both studied. Analytical models accounting for crossover estimate the iron concentrations during continuous cycling using microporous Daramic separators and cation-selective Nafion separators. With both. the model predicts a buildup of iron in the negative electrolyte and a depletion of iron in the positive electrolyte that limits the capacity. Decreasing the amount of negative electrolyte relative to the positive enhances the electrolyte utilization. Cost models were used to optimize the separator thickness for capacity retention. coulombic efficiency. and voltaic efficiency. Batteries using Nafion are found to be double the cost of those using Daramic. With the optimized separator. the capacity must be enhanced further to reach the full market potential.

This makes the process very inefficient and restricts the grid’s ability to rely upon intermittent renewable sources. Grid scale energy storage. such as a Redox Flow Battery (RFB) can alleviate these issues by storing energy when it is available and distributing energy as needed. One promising RFB chemistry is the all-Iron flow battery. Iron is low cost. domestically available. and the electrolytes can be used at mildly acidic pHs. The all-iron flow battery involves the iron (II/III) redox couple on the positive electrode and iron plating/stripping on the negative electrode.

1325714,An Investigation of PBI/PA Membranes for Application in Pump Cells for the Purification and Pressurization of Hydrogen,2012,Tyler Joseph Petek,,,,,,About 94 million tons of hydrogen is consumed annually as a chemical feedstock worldwide. Hydrogen is also a promising energy carrier. As both a chemical feedstock as well as a renewable energy carrier. very pure hydrogen is required. Electrochemical hydrogen pump cells operating at 120 C-180 C with a polybenzimidazole membrane imbibed with phosphoric acid were investigated for the electrochemical purification and pressurization of hydrogen. In this device. dilute or impure hydrogen gas is oxidized at the anode. the proton product crosses the membrane to the cathode where they are reduced to form hydrogen gas. It was found that the pump cell could purify simulated reformate containing 3% CO. A cell voltage of 0.145 V. or 0.03 W/cm 2. was required to operate the cell at 150 C and 0.2 A/cm 2. This corresponds to 7.7 watt-hours per mole of hydrogen pumped which is 1.000–10.000 times smaller than conventional purification techniques such as pressure swing adsorption. It was also found that the electrochemical pump cells could purify and pressurize the simulated reformate to at least 20 psi above the inlet pressure with only one 50 cm 2 lab prototype cell. With cell pressure differentials above 5 psi. there was an undetermined amount of hydrogen back diffusion across the membrane. The ability of the pump cell to operate continuously over 20 hours was also investigated. Operating at current densities above 0.4 A/cm 2 resulted in a decrease in the membrane conductivity. The membrane conductivity could be recovered to some degree by reversing the electrodes (ie the anode became the cathode and vice versa).

Security assumes a significant job in the system to anticipate the unapproved get to. abuses of information. checking. and information change and so on the different cryptography libraries that are appropriate in the field of Internet of Things (IoT). The usage of encryption and unscrambling in the field of cryptography gives a strong method for transferring messages forward and backward between clients without the additional danger of the message being undermined to the undesirable workforce. With developing IoT assaults. this decision would not be a choice. Consequently. increasingly more IoT gadgets are probably going to be furnished with more grounded cryptographic natives in the coming years. Be that as it may. as quantum processing is drawing closer. the present most wellknown cryptosystems would not withstand these new machines.

The current IoT space comes with numerous security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include weak authentication (IoT devices are being used with default credentials). unencrypted messages sent between devices. SQL injections and lack of verification or encryption of software updates. This allows attackers to easily intercept data to collect PII (Personally Identifiable Information). user credentials can be stolen at login or malware can be injected into newly updated firmware.

Egypt is presented. The primary objectives of this paper are to analyze the system components separately and to identify and quantify the sites having largest energy and exergy losses at different load.The performance of the plant was estimated by a component-wise modeling and a detailed break-up of energy and exergy losses for the considered plant has been presented at different loads (Maximum load. 75% load and. 50% load). Energy losses mainly occurred in the condenser where (404.653 MW at Max load. 306.747 MW at 75% load and 278.849 MW at 50% load) is lost to the environment. The percentage ratio of the exergy destruction to the total exergy destruction was found to be maximum in the Turbine system (42% at Max load. 59% at 75% load and 46.1 at 50% load) followed by the condenser (28% at Max load. 20.3% at 75% load) while at 50% load the feed water heaters showed more exergy destruction (27.7%) than condenser (23.8) and then the feed water heaters (20.8% at max load. 12.1 at 75% load). In addition. the calculated thermal efficiency based on the specific heat input to the steam was≈ 43% while the exergy efficiency of the power cycle was (44%-48%).,True,i1Im8b0AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,56,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_Elmaihy/publication/320383541_Energy_and_Exergy_Analysis_of_a_Steam_Power_Plant_in_Egypt/links/59f39eb5aca272607e291afb/Energy-and-Exergy-Analysis-of-a-Steam-Power-Plant-in-Egypt.pdf,12084812413550894524,/scholar?cites=12084812413550894524,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_Elmaihy/publication/320383541_Energy_and_Exergy_Analysis_of_a_Steam_Power_Plant_in_Egypt/links/59f39eb5aca272607e291afb/Energy-and-Exergy-Analysis-of-a-Steam-Power-Plant-in-Egypt.pdf,0,0,0

We generalize this study to a material surface. cube and sphere. We find that the fractal dimension of the surface can be explained by the same mechanism as that proposed by Villermaux & Gagne (Phys. Rev. Lett. vol. 73. 1994. p. 252) for the line. The fractal dimension of the line or the surface is a linear function of time up to times of the order of the smallest characteristic time of turbulence (or Kolmogorov timescale).  For volume objects we describe the respective role of the Reynolds number and of the object's characteristic size. Using the method of characteristics with KS we compute the evolution with time of a concentration field and measure the fractal dimension of the intersection of this scalar field with a given plane. For these objects. we retrieve the result of Villermaux & Innocenti (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 393. 1999. p. 123) that the Reynolds number does not affect the development of the fractal dimension of the iso-scalar surface and extend this result to volume geometries. We also find that for volume objects the characteristic time of development of the fractal dimension is the large scales' characteristic time and not the Kolmogorov timescale.,True,i1Im8b0AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,29,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/1612/,1058307659962699748,/scholar?cites=1058307659962699748,,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/1612/01/nicolleau.f.c2.pdf,0,0,0

We vary the particles’ inertia when there is no gravity. and the particles’ drift at constant inertia. We use kinematic simulation (KS) for which large values of the Reynolds number can be achieved. We investigate the pair diffusivity to discuss Richardson’s law. and the locality-in-scale hypothesis that underlies that law. for different particle drifts and Stokes numbers. The effect of inertia and gravity on Richardson’s law and the autocorrelation in time of the pair’s separation are studied for an inertial scale ratio of 1000 and different initial separations Δ 0.

The new concept is based on monitoring of the yaw rate difference between the tractor and semitrailer and applying differential braking on the semitrailer at a certain articulation rate threshold. The new proposed control strategy will make the semitrailer act as smart equipment regardless of the tractor type. because tractors and semitrailers are built by different manufacturers. ,True,i1Im8b0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,6,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJHVS.2013.051100,15293795265935453908,/scholar?cites=15293795265935453908,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_Elmaihy/publication/264812103_Tractor-semitrailer_jackknifing_elimination_using_semitrailer_differential_braking_technique/links/5745e08c08ae9ace84243306.pdf,0,0,0

For this purpose. different turbulence models such as k- ε models (standard.

In addition. two different wall functions (standard wall function and enhanced two-layer wall function were tested and compered with the experimental study at two blowing ratios (0.5. 1) and two injection angles (35o. 55o). It was found that the realizable k–ε model with enhanced all treatment (two-layer approach) was in reasonable agreement with experimental data. which proved its advantage as compared with other turbulence models. So the realizable k–ε model with enhanced wall treatment (two-layer approach) was selected in this paper to study the effect of injection angle variation. The film cooling geometry in the present paper is similar to that used in a previous study. The coolant flow temperature was kept constant at 188 K at a velocity 6.25 m/s and a constant density ratio of 1.6.

The conducted simulations are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the ventilation system by analyzing the numerical predictions of temperature. visibility and CO concentration fields for different sizes of tunnel fire namely; 5. 10. 20 and 40 MW. Numerical simulations predicted the overall flow field and gave valuable estimates of the temperatures. visibility and CO distribution throughout the tunnel.

The critical velocity to prevent upstream smoke propagation in the event of a tunnel fire is an important parameter in the design process of a ventilation system. The current techniques for prediction of the values of the critical velocity are mainly based on semi-empirical equations. These equations are obtained from the Froude number preservation combined with available experimental data. Full-scale experimental test programs are expensive which stimulates the application of numerical simulation to these design problems. Simulated full-scale point supply ventilation system of Memorial Tunnel in USA is investigated. Three-dimensional simulation of smoke flow in the tunnel is carried out using FLUENT 6.3.The model includes component models for turbulence. fire. radiation heat transfer. and smoke production. The impact of fire size on critical velocity is investigated. The findings from the numerical simulations supported the published results of experimental test program and also the three semi-empirical correlations found in literature. This suggests that the simulation techniques can be used with confidence to predict the critical ventilation velocity for large-scale tunnels.

The main objective is to assess the cyclic and cylinder to cylinder variations of cylinder pressure under different operating conditions with both types of fuel. Four sets of pressure transducers and conditioning devices are installed to record the pressure-crank angle histories inside each of the four engine cylinders. Electronic data acquisition techniques and a specially developed software package are used to measure. record and analyze all the parameters at different test conditions. Observations show that Cyclic variations of pressure in each cylinder during the combustion process are 20 to 25% less with CNG. The variations in the maximum rate of pressure rise are also 15-20% less while the average values are slightly higher. The deviations (from average) of the cyclic values of Pmax and its timing CAPmax. show large inverse correlation to each other. The increasing or decreasing trends in Pmax and its timing do not continue for more than 3-4 successive cycles. This is more apparent with natural gas fuelling at all engine operating conditions. The cross correlation coefficient has a certain degree of repetition every 2-3 cycles and even less with gasoline.

Currently. many refineries apply Linear Programming (LP) techniques for their production planning models. However. this will often give inconsistent predictions of refinery productivity and operation. Moreover. the stringent environmental regulations. product qualities. and heavier feed stocks make it necessary to develop accurate models for refinery-production planning.

1325774,Integration of hydrogen and CO2 management within refinery planning,2008,Ibrahim Alhajri,,,,,University of Waterloo,The petroleum refining industry is considered to be one of the most important industries affecting daily life. However. this industry is facing many new and challenging situations. including such new trends as increased heavy crude markets. a shrinking market for fuel oils. clean-fuel legislation that encourages production of ultra low-sulfur (ULS) gasoline and diesel fuels. and strict green house gas (GHG) regulations to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Refineries thus face a serious need to increase the capacity of their conversion units. such as the hydrocracker and fluid catalytic cracking units (FCCs). and to increase their consumption of hydrogen to meet the new requirements. These increases should be planned with reference to allowable CO2 emission limits. Refineries therefore need an appropriate tool for planning their operations and production.  This research focuses on refinery planning under hydrogen and carbon management considerations. A systematic method that uses mathematical programming techniques to integrate the management of hydrogen and CO2 for refinery planning is proposed. Three different models for refinery planning. hydrogen management. and CO2 management. are prepared and then properly integrated.

Water is an active fluid in the thermodynamical cycle; an objective function is obtained by using vapor enthalpy (a nonlinear function of operating conditions). Utilizing classical methods for maximizing the objective function usually leads to suboptimal solutions. Therefore. this article uses ANNs to estimate the steam properties as a function of operating conditions and GAs to optimize the thermodynamical cycle. The operating conditions are chosen with the aim of gaining maximum work in a boiler for a specific heat.

There has been a significant investment made into the recovery of oil from these oil sands reserves. One of the major concerns is the high natural water consumption in the process and methods of conservation of water and energy. Water and steam management are essential for the development of optimal energy infrastructures for the oil sands industry. This paper focuses on a case study on the effective steam management for an existing oil sands company in Canada. Based on an analysis of the material and energy balances of the existing plant. several design improvements were proposed. These design improvements focus on recovering energy lost due to steam wastage and provides effective and energy efficient methods of steam generation to meet the company’s requirements. Design simulations were completed using Aspen Plus. and accordingly a techno-economic analysis evaluating the feasibility of the proposed design improvements was conducted.,True,RwWyDOAAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,http://iieom.org/ieom2014/pdfs/257.pdf,,,,,http://iieom.org/ieom2014/pdfs/257.pdf,0,0,0
1325792,Optimization model for the Integration of Nuclear Energy in Oil Sand Operations,,M Elsholkami and A Elkamel and I Al-Syed and A Jetly and J Tordiff and I Alhajri,,,,,,Currently. conventional power generation technologies are being utilized to power the oil sands industry. The increasingly stringent regulations on emissions from these technologies require the use of carbon capture technologies. which have very high capital and operating costs. Nuclear energy has a much smaller carbon footprint than any other conventional power generation technology and is also the cheapest possible option forward. This has paved the way for possible nuclear energy integration in oil sands operations. This study considers eight power generation technologies; two currently operational generation III nuclear reactors. two currently under construction generation III+ nuclear reactors. and the conventional pulverized coal (PC) and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) technologies with and without carbon capture. Eight different case studies are considered to discuss and analyze different possibilities for integrating nuclear energy. The optimal solution integrates 25% of nuclear power to the current power generatiing system for meeting Alberta’s electricity demand. The overall total cost of the optimal solution is approximately $ USD 85 billion over a lifespan of 60 years. Scenarios involving secondary revenue streams such as steam and hydrogen production. and selling excess electricity to the power grid have also been considered to determine their effect on the optimal results.,True,RwWyDOAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,http://www.iieom.org/ieom2014/pdfs/254.pdf,,,,,http://www.iieom.org/ieom2014/pdfs/254.pdf,0,0,0

1325812,Experimental Investigations of Internal Air-water Flows,2015,Hassan Shaban,,,,,,The objective of the present thesis research is to apply state-of-the-art experimental and data analysis techniques to the study of gas-liquid pipe flows. with a focus on conditions occurring in header-feeder systems of nuclear reactors under different accident scenarios. Novel experimental techniques have been proposed for the identification of the flow regime and measurement of the flow rates of both phases in gas-liquid flows. These techniques were automated. non-intrusive and economical. which ensured that their use would be feasible in industrial as well as laboratory settings. Measurements of differential pressure and the gas and liquid flow rates were collected in vertical upwards air-water flow at near-atmospheric pressure. It was demonstrated that the probability density function of the normalized differential pressure was indicative of the flow regime and using non-linear dimensionality reduction (the Elastic Maps Algorithm). it was possible to automate the process of identifying the flow regime from the differential pressure signal. The relationship between the probability density function and the power spectral density of normalized differential pressure with the gas and liquid flow rates in air-water pipe flow was also established and a machine learning algorithm (using Independent Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks) was proposed for the estimation of the phase flow rates from these properties. The proposed methods were adapted for use with single and dual conductivity wire-mesh sensors in vertical upwards and downwards air--water flows.

Solving the multiphase flow equations numerically introduces many levels of complexity in view of the different approaches that are suitable for different flow regimes. the interactions between the phases and within the same phase. and issues of inter-compatibility of the various multiphase models and turbulence models. As a result. it is sometimes necessary to compromise precision of the solution in order to ensure its convergence. To deal with these issues. it is often required to use empirical closure relationships that define the interaction between the phases and relatively simple turbulence models which may not be very accurate.

1325837,Application of Nanofluids in Solar Energy,2015,Ruchik Thaker and Jatin Patel,6,Journal of Alternate Energy Sources and Technologies,2,1-11,STM Journals,Nanofluids are skillfully prepared colloidal suspensions of nanoparticles (which is of size 1–100 nm) in a base fluid; is a relatively new field. which is not more than two decades old. The main idea of this paper is to know about the applications of nanofluids in solar thermal engineering system. The shortage of conventional sources and environmental problems motivated the researchers to use non-conventional energy sources such as solar energy and others. Thus it is essential to improve the efficiency and performance of the solar systems. It is found that nanofluids have higher thermal conductivity which is temperature-dependent at very low particle concentrations than the respective conventional fluids. This can be observed as one of the very important parameters to upgrade the performances of many applications of nanofluids. Challenges of nanofluids are also considered in this paper.

The challenge with this process is increasing electricity cost and rejection of brine. We have modelled a new system which is capable to run RO module using low-grade thermal energy instead. A steam source drives a cylinder piston arrangement and this kinetic energy is transferred to another cylinder piston through a linkage mechanism. This energy finally is used to pressurize the saline water towards RO membrane. Steam may be generated from Solar or from a biomass boiler as available in rural areas of India.

Random network coding has gained popularity over the years by combining the received packet randomly before forwarding them. resulting in a complex Jordan Gaussian Elimination (JGE) decoding process. The effectiveness of random NC is through cooperation among nodes. In this paper. we propose a simple. low-complexity cooperative protocol that exploits NC in a deterministic manner resulting in improved diversity. data rate. and less complex JGE decoding process.

To maintain the required QoS in such complicated networks. the Traffic Engineering (TE) should be equipped with optimum traffic management. routing mechanism. and switching operations. which are what this paper tackles. where the TE is identified as the optimal distribution of flows in the existing network. In this paper. an effective multipath routing mathematical model is developed based on several previous mechanisms to ensure the guaranteed desired QoS and loading balance according to the Telecommunication Network Systems (TCS) resources. to achieve the optimum TE. and hence improving the network usage efficiency.

The OFDM with cyclic prefix (CP) can compensate lacks for the time-invariant multi-path channel effects using a single tap equaliser. However. for mobile wireless communication. such as the use of OFDM in ambulances. the Doppler shift is expected. which produces a doubly dispersive communication channel where a complex equaliser is needed.

As a criterion for choosing the number of paths. a composite criterion is used that takes into account several parameters such as total path capacity and maximum path delay. The mathematical analysis of using the developed method is carried out. and the simulation results show that there are a limited number of the most significant routes that can maximize the composite quality of service indicator. which depends on the network connectivity and the amount of the traffic.

1325943,Physical Layer Deterministic Network Coding Using PUM Turbo Codes over AWGN Channel. N Nodes through a Base Station Scenario,2016,Hani Attar,8,Communications and Network,04,241,Scientific Research Publishing,Network Coding (NC) is a recent technique which is used to improve the transmission data rate and the power efficiency. These goals are obtained by combining data together before transmitting them. resulting to less transmitted data that carry the same amount of information. NC research work over the physical layer and the upper layers are popular and needed to be more investigated. In this paper. we propose a practical system of large-number of connected multi-source network coding (LMSNC). at the physical layer that exploits the broadcast nature of the wireless channel. using the practical and bandwidth-efficient schemes decode-and-forward (DF) and then compare it with Amplify and Forward (AF). The theoretical analysis and the simulation results show the effect of the noise when it cumulates in AF system and how DF is solving this severe default. Moreover. we consider the MSNC for Small-number of connected sources (SMSNC) and the two-way communication setup where two users exchange their information over an intermediate network node (ideally called Base Station). as two reference cases to compare with. With SMSNC. the number of necessary downlink transmissions from the intermediate node to the users is reduced. and thus the throughput is increased. Simulation results obtained using high-performance non-binary turbo codes. based on Partial Unit Memory (PUM) codes (4. 2. 1. 4) and (8. 4. 3. 8); confirm that combining PUM Turbo Code (PUMTC) and NC in the proposed MSNC setup gives almost the same BER performance as that for SMSNC at the small number of processing steps mainly when PUMTC (8. 4. 3. 8) is …,True,Df-srZkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://www.scirp.org/html/3-6101607_72287.htm,2828469482533571572,/scholar?cites=2828469482533571572,,,https://www.scirp.org/html/3-6101607_72287.htm,0,0,0

The frequency selective nature of the channel favours the combination with a multicarrier approach such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). However. as Doppler spread increases. OFDM loses its orthogonality. resulting in severe inter-symbol (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI). This is addressed firstly by the generalisation of OFDM to fractional Fourier transform (FrFT)-based multicarrier approaches. which can provide better resilience in the presence of Doppler spread. Secondly. in higher mobility scenarios. an equalisation scheme is employed. whose lower complexity in an FrFT-based multicarrier setting can further minimised by a reduction of the equaliser.

Chirp like basis (fractional Fourier transform-fractional cosine transform) may be used instead of complex exponential basis in this case to improve the system performance. However. in multicarrier transmission. the high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal is one of the difficult problems that face both the chirp and the exponential basis. In this paper. an evaluation for the PAPR performance of a multicarrier system based on the fractional cosine transform (FrCT) is introduced and then compared with DFrFT and FFT. Moreover. applying the SLAM technique over these systems is provided to understand the behaviour of these systems when applying SLAM. Simulations verify that this system obtains a better PAPR performance. Moreover. further PAPR reduction can be gained using the well-known PAPR reduction methods. Moreover. applying SLAM technique improves the performance of (dB) by 4 dB to 5 dB and all systems become as competitive to each other when SLAM is applied. Finally.

In this study. double‐network cellulose hydrogels are used as a soft. responsive medium and are incorporated into Fabry–Pérot optical etalons. The thin cellulose hydrogel layer can be solution processed. The hygroscopic hydrogel undergoes both refractive index and thickness changes in response to changes in humidity. This leads to strong changes in reflection due to optical interference within the metal–insulator–metal (MIM) cavity. The response can be optimized by adjusting the chemical crosslinker ratio.

Four test conditions were selected to elucidate the short-term effect of the exposure of the composites to an acidic environment which was achieved by simulating an acidic condition of Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) solution with a pH of 2.2 at room temperature (27°C). Exposure periods of 3. 6 and 9 days (3PA. 6PA. 9PA) were considered. while samples not exposed to the acid solution were used as control (NP). In order to measure the possible surface degradation and hardness variation of the CCHPRC due to immersion in the acid solution. scanning electron microscopy in addition to energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). and hardness tests were carried out. As a result. the gradual material degradation and poor adhesion between reinforcement and matrix was observed which was confirmed by SEM/EDS analysis. Prolonged acid immersion time seemed to promote an increase in terms of the composites’ hardness. It is possible to conclude that the hardness characteristics of the composite (NP- 12.98 HV; 3PA- 7.27 HV; 6PA- 14.40 HV; 9PA- 19.07 HV) increased after immersion on exposure for 6 and 9 days. in comparison with the control sample.,True,fOSSIUkAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,0,http://ugspace.ug.edu.gh/handle/123456789/34136,,,,,http://ugspace.ug.edu.gh/bitstream/handle/123456789/34136/Microstructural-evolution-and-hardness-properties-of-coircoconut-husk-powder-reinforced-polymer-composites-subjected-to-an-acidic-environmentProcedia-Manufacturing.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

This paper provides a comprehensive review of modifications introduced to improve the GDL performance to date. The majority of these modifications have been carried out on fuel cells and the GDL in electrolysers has been studied to a lesser extent. The main focus of these modifications was found to be on water management and reactant delivery improvement as per defined for the role of GDLs.

Unitised regenerative fuel cell (URFC) is an electrochemical cell that can operate both as a fuel cell (FC) and an electrolyser (E). However. for a widespread commercialisation. further improvements are required that address the durability. performance. and cost limitations. One of the main challenging components in developing URFCs is the gas diffusion layer (GDL) as it plays different vital roles. some of which are paradoxical in FC and E-modes. Therefore. in this paper. the published research on GDL of PEM-URFCs as well as relevant studies on PEM fuel cells and electrolysers are critically reviewed.

1326003,Gas diffusion layers in fuel cells and electrolysers: A novel semi-empirical model to predict electrical conductivity of sintered metal fibres,2019,Reza Omrani and Bahman Shabani,12,Energies,5,855,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper introduces novel empirical as well as modified models to predict the electrical conductivity of sintered metal fibres and closed-cell foams. These models provide a significant improvement over the existing models and reduce the maximum relative error from as high as just over 30% down to about 10%. Also. it is shown that these models provide a noticeable improvement for closed-cell metal foams. However. the estimation of electrical conductivity of open-cell metal foams was improved marginally over previous models. Sintered porous metals are widely used in electrochemical devices such as water electrolysers. unitised regenerative fuel cells (URFCs) as gas diffusion layers (GDLs). and batteries. Having a more accurate prediction of electrical conductivity based on variation by porosity helps in better modelling of such devices and hence achieving improved designs. The models presented in this paper are fitted to the experimental results in order to highlight the difference between the conductivity of sintered metal fibres and metal foams. It is shown that the critical porosity (maximum achievable porosity) can play an important role in sintered metal fibres to predict the electrical conductivity whereas its effect is not significant in open-cell metal foams. Based on the models. the electrical conductivity reaches zero value at 95% porosity rather than 100% for sintered metal fibres.

The study was conducted with a focus on challenges associated with operation at temperatures lower than the recommended designed temperature. With DEA. gradual voltage drop happens due to the accumulation of water and impurities such as nitrogen. Hence. periodic purging of the anode side is required to remove excess water and impurities that are accumulated at the anode side over time. Short purge intervals increase hydrogen loss that translates into low fuel utilisation. whereas long purge intervals result in voltage drop due to high water and impurity accumulations. Therefore. an optimal purge strategy should be implemented to maximise the stack energy efficiency.

The major performance challenge in URFCs is FC-mode operation due to the water management requirements. In this study. the effect of titanium-felt gas diffusion layer (GDL) hydrophobisation on FC-mode performance at low FC operating temperature (i.e. 30 °C) is investigated. Higher cell operating temperatures (i.e. ~70-80 °C) assist in water removal in vapour form and hence GDL hydrophobisation effect is not significant. Experimental results showed that a low amount of PTFE-coating improves the FC-performance at both low and high humidity conditions. It was observed that when FC temperature is relatively low. even dry conditions can result in flooding of the cell due to presence of more liquid water.

One of the challenges in using MH hydrogen storage canisters is their limited hydrogen supply rate as the hydrogen release from MH is an endothermic reaction. Therefore. in order to meet the required hydrogen supply rate. high amounts of MH should be employed that usually suggests storage of hydrogen to be higher than necessary for the application. adding to the size. weight and cost of the system. On the other hand. the exhaust heat (i.e. that is usually wasted if not utilised for this purpose) from open-cathode FCs is a low-grade heat. However. this heat can be transferred to MH canisters through convection to heat them up and increase their hydrogen release rate.

Open Access Journal,This study performs a 3D turbulent flow numerical simulation to improve heat transfer characteristics of wavy fin-and-tube heat exchangers. A compound design encompassing louver. flat. and vortex generator onto wavy fins can significantly enhance the heat transfer performance of wavy fin-and-tube heat exchangers. Replacement of wavy fins around tubes with flat fins is not effective as far as the reduction of thermal resistance is concerned. although an appreciable pressure drop reduction can be achieved. Adding two louvers with a width of 8 mm to the flat portion can reduce thermal resistance up to 6% in comparison with the reference wavy fin. Increasing the louver number and width can further decrease the thermal resistance. Also. it is found that the optimum louver angle is equal to the wavy angle for offering the lowest thermal resistance. Therefore. compound geometry with three louvers. a width of 12 mm. and the louver angle being equal to wavy angle with waffle height to be the same as fin pitch of the reference wavy fin has the most reduction in thermal resistance of 16% for a pumping power of 0.001 W.

It was shown that heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop are functions of ratio of horizontal diameter to vertical diameter. It means that not only the diameter ratio. but also ellipse orientation affects heat transfer and pressure drop. Interestingly. it was found out that the pressure drop may be as low as one half of a circular fin tube. Moreover. with the same incoming air velocity. heat transfer coefficient on vertical fin is higher than circular type. Because of the lower pressure drop. higher incoming velocity may be applied. and therefore. higher heat transfer can be achieved. Altogether. tube with annular elliptical fin may be a good candidate for circular type when there is space restriction or severe limitation on pressure drop.,True,le1OPFQAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC,7,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13369-016-2226-z,9041020887705645135,/scholar?cites=9041020887705645135,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hossain_Nemati/project/Heat-exchanger-with-finned-tubes/attachment/5959cbaa1042bf83f34c1167/AS:511896592883712@1499057066334/download/art%253A10.1007%252Fs13369-016-2226-z-1.pdf?context=projectUpdatesLog,0,0,0

Effects of waffle height. adding slits on wavy fins and vortex generators on the thermal resistance of wavy fin-and-tube heat exchangers are investigated. Increasing waffle height. imposing slits on the wavy fin. or adding vortex generators can provide 6–10% reduction in thermal resistance subject to constraints of the same pumping power. Yet. the compound design including all these three features together is even more powerful to achieve a 16% reduction of thermal resistance. Increasing waffle height will decrease thermal resistance. but the accompanied pressure drop is even higher. Hence. it is highly recommended that the waffle height should be less than the fin pitch or at a corrugation angle being less than 15°.

It is clear that the design of a heat sink is not straightforward and needs some secondary equations. Therefore. in the present study. dimensionless forms of equations were presented first and the effect of each dimensionless group on the entropy generation rate was studied deeply. Finally. a semi-analytical equation was proposed to relate dimensionless thickness to dimensionless fin height and Bi number as well. Interestingly. since no restricting assumption was made during derivation. this equation can be used for both natural and forced convection. Moreover. this equation is based on dimensionless parameters. so it is not limited to some specific geometries or working conditions.

A critical review of the literature was done. and mathematical models of drying curves proposed by investigators were evaluated. A comparison between the best mathematical models of fit in the drying curves used in past experiments and a two-term Gaussian model was performed. This model improved all the results of fit in each experiment. Drying rates and drying stages were obtained and discussed. An average drying rate for each experiment from the two-term Gaussian model was calculated. This value allowed for visualizing and comparing the average speed of evaporated water in each experiment for the different dryers. Finally. and after having verified that almost all drying occurs mainly by a diffusion phenomenon. an analysis on the effective moisture diffusivity and activation energy values was performed. The results indicated that there was no dependency of these quantities on independent variables such as the drying air temperature. the drying air velocity. and the sample thickness.

Introduction–The main by-product obtained in the olive oil extraction is the alpeorujo. It is formed by a mixture of olive cake and aqueous sludge. In the olive oil extraction process. approximately 80% is alpeorujo and 10% of this waste is olive stone which is separated by means of mechanical procedures. Olive stone is separated from three different ways: during the olive oil extraction process. by recovering from the olive paste or by recovering from virgin or exhausted pomace [1]. Generally. olive stone (the endocarp of the olive) is accompanied by the pulp (the mesocarp of the olive) and other very fine particles.

1326061,From Newton's bucket to rotating polygons: experiments on surface instabilities in swirling flows,2014,B Bach and EC Linnartz and MH Vested and Anders Andersen and Tomas Bohr,759,Journal of fluid mechanics,,386,Cambridge University Press,We present an experimental study of ‘polygons’ forming on the free surface of a swirling water flow in a partially filled cylindrical container. In our set-up. we rotate the bottom plate and the cylinder wall with separate motors. We thereby vary rotation rate and shear strength independently and move from a rigidly rotating ‘Newton’s bucket’flow to one where bottom and cylinder wall are rotating oppositely and the surface is strongly turbulent but flat on average. Between those two extremes. we find polygonal states for which the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. We investigate the phase diagram spanned by the two rotational frequencies at a given water filling height and find polygons in a regime. where the two frequencies are sufficiently different and. predominantly. when they have opposite signs. In addition to the extension of the family of polygons found with the stationary cylinder. we find a new family of smaller polygons for larger rotation rates of the cylinder. opposite to that of the bottom plate. Further. we find a ‘monogon’. a figure with one corner. roughly an eccentric circle rotating in the same sense as the cylinder. The case where only the bottom plate is rotating is compared with the results of Jansson et al.(Phys. Rev. Lett.. vol. 96. 2006. art. 174502). where the same size of cylinder was used. and although the overall structure of the phase diagram spanned by water height and rotational frequency is the same. many details are different. To test the effect of small experimental defects. such as misalignment of the bottom plate. we investigate whether the rotating polygons are phase locked with the bottom plate. and although we find …,True,hYFE6igAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,18,https://iypt.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/From-Newton%E2%80%99s-bucket-to-rotating-polygons.pdf,12391735264097982452,/scholar?cites=12391735264097982452,,,https://iypt.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/From-Newton%E2%80%99s-bucket-to-rotating-polygons.pdf,0,0,0
1326062,Integration of heat pumps in greater Copenhagen,2014,Bjarne Bach and Jesper Werling and Torben Schmidt Ommen,10,Retrieved October,,2019,,The municipality of Copenhagen has the ambitious goal of becoming the first CO2 neutral capital before 2025. Using large heat pumps for district heat production in Copenhagen can contribute to a more effective way of producing heat in the future. and thereby help to fulfil the goal of CO2 neutrality. At the same time heat pumps can be an important player in the integration of the fluctuating electricity production from renewable energy sources. and relieve the pressure on the limited biomass resources. This study analyses the technical and economical aspects of integrating heat pumps in the Greater Copenhagen district heating system. Three main aspects of heat pump integration have been investigated:(I) the potential sources.(II) the feasible heat pump technologies. and (III) the economical competitiveness of heat pumps in the district heating system.The analyses of the heat sources were based upon gathered data on temperatures. flows. hydrography. and locations. as well as considering the technical and economical challenges. The thermodynamic modelling of heat pumps were done in EES. And in this study an auxiliary program. COPcalc. for calculations of seasonal variations in COP and capacities of heat pumps was developed. The output from COPcalc is a COP and capacity profile. which can be implemented in the energy system optimization model Balmorel. The Balmorel model was developed further to make a better representation of heat pumps. for analysing the seasonal variations of COP. and to be enable to represent heat pumps connected on the distribution grid.,True,hYFE6igAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,10,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.695.3586&rep=rep1&type=pdf,9145575790223275699,/scholar?cites=9145575790223275699,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.695.3586&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1326064,Measurement and verification of industrial DSM projects,2014,Walter Booysen,,,,,,Energy cost-reduction projects implemented on complex industrial systems present several challenges. The involvement of multiple project stakeholders associated with programmes such as demand side management (DSM) further increases potential risks. The process of determining project impacts is especially important due to the direct financial impact on stakeholders. A good understanding of the independent measurement and verification (M&V) process is therefore vital to ensure an unbiased process. A review of existing M&V frameworks and guidelines found that M&V protocols and templates are well developed and widely implemented. Unfortunately. the official literature provides little guidance on the practical M&V of industrial DSM projects. This prompted a detailed literature analysis of numerous publications to ascertain the industry norm. The diverse results obtained are categorised. normalised and graphically presented to highlight shortcomings in present M&V processes. This thesis develops several practical methodologies and guidelines to address the needs highlighted by the literature analysis. Three chapters are dedicated to the development and verification of these solutions. The first entails the evaluation of data quality with the aim of producing an accurate and error-free data-set. The second develops. evaluates and ultimately selects a baseline model representative of normal system operations. The final chapter presents project performance and uses existing methods to monitor system changes and project performance over the long term.

1326065,Reducing energy consumption on RSA mines through optimised compressor control,2010,Walter Booysen,,,,,,South Africa experienced a severe shortfall in electricity supply during 2008. Eskom. the national electricity supplier. implemented several strategies to alleviate the situation. The Power Conservation Programme set the mining sector a mandatory target to reduce its annual power consumption by 10%. The quickest way to achieve these savings is by optimising the largest power consumers on the mines. Compressed air is one of these. constituting approximately 40% of total electricity consumption on platinum mines. Several methods to reduce power consumption on compressed air systems were investigated. The investigation revealed that centrifugal air compressors on the mines are typically manually operated at a fixed delivery output. Attempts to reduce electricity consumption by reducing air demand will therefore not necessarily lead to savings. A control system that will enable the compressor to automatically match the supply with system demand is required. An optimised control strategy was then developed and implemented on three compressed air systems. Measurements demonstrated savings between 13% and 49%. With the Eskom tariffs proposed for 2010. this implies a total saving of R 46 million per year for these three case studies. This will achieve. and may even exceed. the mandatory reduction in electricity consumption of the mines. These results demonstrate that one of the quickest ways to reduce energy consumption on South African mines is by implementing optimised compressor controls.,True,7z1qB5cAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,18,http://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/4094,619865262348315305,/scholar?cites=619865262348315305,,,http://repository.nwu.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10394/4094/booysen_w.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Methods in use for generating compressed air in the mining industry have created the potential to decrease energy consumption by improving on compressor control strategies. The savings generated by optimising compressed air delivery will have a substantial impact on energy efficiency.South Africa is presently experiencing an energy supply crisis.

This is mainly due to lack of appropriate compressor controls. Consequently. such compressed-air systems are inefficient and wasteful. A compressed-air system at a South African gold mine was retrofitted with an automatic compressor control system featuring compressor cascading and pressure bandwidth control. The goal was to implement a simple demand-side management (DSM) strategy to afford meaningful electrical energy savings. The automatic control strategy realised a saving of 1.25 MW (on a baseline of 7.22 MW) during Eskom's evening peak demand window. This represents a reduction of 17.3% in electrical power consumption during the evening peak period. and savings of nearly R2.9 million per year.,True,7z1qB5cAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,9,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2012000300002,1111526774361827289,/scholar?cites=1111526774361827289,,,http://www.scielo.org.za/pdf/jesa/v23n2/02.pdf,0,0,0

In addition. some mining groups are cash-strapped due to reduced commodity prices and higher-than-inflation cost increases. This means that client funding for DSM projects is limited. Even with Eskom-IDM's financial contributions. DSM-projects must generate adequate and sustainable savings to ensure acceptable payback of client project capital. Unfortunately. savings from DSM projects are sometimes tough to predict. This makes it increasingly difficult to motivate client capital expenditure on these projects.

Companies therefore need to prepare for the consequences which the proposed tax will have on their operations. At present. the landscape is overburdened by a large quantity of information intended to support the carbon tax. yet specific guidance is limited. This creates uncertainty for stakeholders.

1326086,STRUCTURING DATA FOR A RSA SECTION 12L ENERGY EFFICIENCY TAX INCENTIVE APPLICATION,2016,HM Janse van Rensburg and W Booysen and SW Van Heerden,,Institute for Industrial Engineering Conference,,435,,South African industries are under pressure to remain internationally competitive. By investing in energy efficiency. companies can lower operating costs. Section 12L of the Income Tax Act.(Act No 58 of 1962) has been implemented to incentivise energy efficiency. To receive the benefit. an application must be compiled by an independent South African National Accreditation System (SANAS) accredited Measurement and Verification (M&V) team. M&V teams are not necessarily familiar with the details surrounding a sites initiative implementation. assistance from industry is required. This article investigates the M&V requirements to understand the complexities involved in analysing facility energy consumption. Different data management techniques are reviewed to identify approaches to handle the large volumes of data generated. The developed methodology is split into two parts. The first part assists in reducing facility complexity to enable the selection of a measurement boundary. The second part streamlines the collection. organising and processing of the measured data and supporting documents. The outcome of the methodology was validated by means of a single complex case study. In this case the methodology was applied to identify Section 12L compliant measurement boundaries. The transparent output of the collected data and supporting documentation illustrated the definitive auditability of the results.,True,7z1qB5cAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,1,http://repository.nwu.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10394/19387/SAIIE%2027th%20Conference%20Proceedings.pdf?sequence=1#page=457,17898915219987317052,/scholar?cites=17898915219987317052,,,http://repository.nwu.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10394/19387/SAIIE%2027th%20Conference%20Proceedings.pdf?sequence=1#page=457,0,0,0

Eskom Demand Side Management (DSM) endorses these projects as they aid in reducing the utility’s peak demand. There is also a cost benefit for participating entities billed on time of use (ToU) tariff structures. The continuous increase of electricity cost ensures that the financial impact of load management remains significant.The impact of a proposed project is determined by an experimental shut down test. Data from the experiment is analysed to gauge the impact of plant operation on working area temperatures.

To estimate the CT liability of an entity. the CO2 emissions must be determined as accurately as possible. The prescribed technique to quantify these emissions. however. is overly generic and its implementation uncertain. The article evaluates the application and understanding of different approaches used for estimating GHG (CO2) emissions by assessing the three prescribed calculation methods (tiers) in terms of the practical applicability. These default tiers for calculating the CO2 emissions have not been practically applied to any “real-world” case studies and have also not been compared to each other in a practical industrial scenario.

One of these incentives is Section 12L of the Income Tax Act (1962). which allows a significant tax deduction as a result of quantifiable energy efficiency (EE) savings. The associated EE savings are calculated by means of baseline models and must be in accordance with the national standard for measurement and verification. i.e. SANS 50010. which is based on international practice. The present study developed a methodology that assists EE projects with incentive applications to objectively evaluate potential modelling options and ultimately select a final model. This methodology is based on the weighted sum method. It is verified by applying it to three actual case studies and is further validated by comparing the results obtained from the case studies to independent results of formal and successful incentive applications. The methodology allows for a transparent selection of a modelling option that is compliant with the relevant tax incentive regulatory requirements and untainted by personal bias.,True,7z1qB5cAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2019000200005,,,,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2019000200005,0,0,0

Leachate of landfills exerts environmental risks mostly on surface and groundwater. with its high pollutant content. which may cause unbearable water quality. This leads to the obligation for decontamination and remediation program to be taken into progress for the landfill area. Among a number of alternatives to cope with leachate. one is to employ the technology of phytoremediation. The main objective of this study was to determine the N accumulation ratios and the effects of landfill leachate in diluted proportions of chosen ratios (as 1/1. 1/2. 1/4. 0). on the growth and development of Cynodon dactylon.

Since biofuel energy is inexhaustible. it is becoming increasingly important to address the energy problem. Today. it is possible to classify biomass energy into two classes: classical and modern. Classical biofuel utilization is the simple burning of wood obtained from tree cutting and animal wastes. where modern biofuel application consists of a variety of fuels produced from various sources. Turkey’s potential for biofuels is estimated to be around 45 Mg. As a renewable energy. it’s been under the Renewable Support Scheme by regulation for more than a decade now. By the end of 2016. installed biofuel electricity generation capacity had reached 468 MW with 2 billion kWh realized (~ 0.7% of national demand). The aim for 2023 is reaching at least 1000 MW (which will be around 1.3% by then). Many analysts believe that the potential for development is higher and realization therefore will surpass the official aims.

The plant originates from the tropical rain forest region of West Africa and occurs in the southern latitudes of Cameroon. Cote d’Ivoire. Ghana. Liberia. Nigeria. Sierra Leone. Togo. and the equatorial region of Angola and the Congo. The world production of palm oil increased tremendously during the last 30 years as a result of rapid expansion of oil palm plantation in South East Asian countries spearheaded by Malaysia and Indonesia. Many countries plant oil palm to produce the oil to cover their local consumption but Malaysia and to a certain extent Indonesia are unique in that the production of palm oil is meant for export. Therefore Malaysia and Indonesia have emerged as major producers of palm oil (B asiron. 2007). The oil palm bears its fruit in bunches varying in weight from 10 to 40 kg. Each fruit is made up of an outer skin (exocarp). a pulp (mesocarp) the oil content of which makes 70–75% of its total weight. a central nut consisting of a shell (endocarp). and the kernel. which itself contains an oil quite different from the palm oil. resembling rather coconut oil. The difference is in colour. Palm mesocarp oil is red while raw palm kernel oil is not red due to the lack of carotenoids (K eshvadi et al.. 2011). The harvested palm fruit bunches pass through processing stages of sterilization. striping. digestion. and palm oil extraction using a solvent or mechanical screw press. Palm nuts and fibers are left as a residue. The nuts are dried and cracked into palm kernel and shell.

Assim. a construção de uma rotina eficiente para a formulação dos contratos pode ser entendida como uma vantagem competitiva. uma vez que permite a obtenção de lucros diferenciados. Entretanto. a utilização de contratos em transações comerciais com energia elétrica implica no surgimento de custos associados à elaboração. à manutenção e à efetivação dos contratos. Uma parte significativa de tais custos é resultado do esforço para implementar mecanismos de segurança mercantil e conferir robustez à relação comercial iniciada com o contrato. O mercado brasileiro de energia elétrica. dada a predominância da geração hidrelétrica. é muito sensível às variações hidrológicas gerando uma fonte de incerteza inerente ao sistema. Como resultado. em períodos de secas prolongadas. o parque gerador sofre uma redução de sua capacidade de suprimento.

1326147,Evolving natural gas markets: LNG possibilities for a hydrothermal power system,2008,Tiago B Correia and Joao P Resende and Agnes M Costa,,,,,,The latest advancements in the natural gas - NG industry have brought new opportunities for the resource's application. especially in the power industry. On the one hand. rapid growth in demand and falling costs of transportation over long distances. particularly as liquefied natural gas - LNG. should lead to a more integrated NG world market. On the other. the deregulation of electricity markets and the growth of independent power producers - IPPs using NG as a fuel for generating peak load power have increased the demand for more flexible NG supply contracts. These factors have allowed a shift in the timing of investment and contract negotiation in NG market. Traditionally. firms searched for trading partners and signed long-term contracts before investing in infrastructure. In the evolving LNG market. producers invest in infrastructure before they have buyers for all their expected outputs. while buyers undertake investment before having firm contracts for all their expected NG needs. These technological and market changes may foster greater participation of a fully flexible NG power plants in the Brazilian electricity market. Nowadays. thermal power long-term capacity contracts customized and negotiated in the local electricity pool (ACR) require power producer to award guarantees of NG firm supply. substantially increasing their cost. A combination of flexible LNG supply contracts and electricity pool contracts may present a solution to the lack of competitiveness of NG power plants in the Brazilian power industry.

The programs of privatization have been frozen while the government has flagged for a policy of a direct intervention in the offer of electric power. This study attempts to analyze the effect of competitive confrontation of companies that operate under the logic private (maximization of profits) with State enterprises (maximization of public policies) in economic efficiency of the market of electricity. For both are used concepts of theory of games. competition potential. contestable markets. market power and economic regulation. The market for electricity is seen as a competitive environment. with state intervention is part of the rules of the game. In fact. the state influence in changes in the supply of electricity cannot be neglected. Finally. it is interesting note that this conception of the market is compatible with the current proposal for institutional model of the Brazilian energy sector and can contribute to the current discussion about its implementation.,True,YQj2-V8AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,0,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21135027,,,,,,0,0,0

The electric power. then. went to be negotiated through contracts in a mixed model with the presence of private and state agents. There are two types of market for the contracts of energy: the bilateral and spot. The focus of this work is on the bilateral market. In Brazil. auctions are being used to negotiate bilateral contracts. The objective of this work is to analyze. through scenarios and the theory of a portfolio. in which contracts one company that generating power must allocate their bids in the auction for the sale of electric power. organized by the Mercado Atacadista de Energia (MAE). to maximize their expected utility. This analysis also covers the risk and expected return. The work described here is conducted in point of view of a vendor and outlines strategies for bids developed for a double auction with participants identified. The result of the model is established through a optimal allocation for bids from the vendors. minimizing the risk given a fixed rate of return.

However. few large scale CCS plants are operating worldwide. This mismatch between expectations and reality is caused by a series of barriers which are preventing this technology from being adopted more widely. The goal of this paper is to identify and review the barriers to CCS development. with a focus on recent cost estimates. and to assess the potential of CCS to enable access to fossil fuels without causing dangerous levels of climate change. The result of the review shows that no CCS barriers are exclusively technical. with CCS cost being the most significant hurdle in the short to medium term. In the long term. CCS is found to be very cost effective when compared with other mitigation options.

Therefore. if global warming is to be limited to the COP21 target. some of the known fossil fuel reserves should remain unburnt.Several recent reports have highlighted the scale of the challenge. drawing on scenarios of climate change mitigation and their implications for the projected consumption of fossil fuels. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a critical and available mitigation opportunity and its contribution to timely and cost-effective decarbonisation of the energy system is widely recognised.

Without policy instruments such as carbon price. the decrease in emissions in the long-term is due to investments in natural gas-based technologies. as they typically have lower capital and operating costs. and also lower electricity consumption than coal-based …,True,OPyo-fAAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620318825,9265744812404111452,/scholar?cites=9265744812404111452,,,,0,0,0

The proposed modelling framework has been tested on a specific case study. which is the Boundary Dam Power Station (Canada). The proposed technological scenarios include the refurbishment of the current coal-based station with a Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) facility. Additional variables under analysis include the composition of the input fuel (natural gas. biogas or a mixture between the two) and the potential adoption of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The results of the paper show that. on a 35-years long timeframe. the adoption of co-fired NGCC with CCS would reduce the cumulative CO2 emissions by 60% with respect to NGCC alone.,True,OPyo-fAAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444639653504414,,,,,,0,0,0
1326170,An integrated control technique for compressor operation,2014,Sara Budinis and Nina F Thornhill,,,,444-449,IEEE,In the gas industry the control of the compression system has two primary objectives: the operation of the machine and also its protection against damage such as that following a surge cycle. The interaction between these two control actions can be strong. causing instability and oscillations. Moreover whenever the gas is recycled for surge protection. it is not delivered as final product and energy is wasted during its compression [1]. These observations provide the incentive for better integrated control. While many researchers have been working on the control of surge. not much has been done to improve the control of the performance or the integration between the two control objectives. even though this need has already been highlighted in the past [2]. This paper proposes a control scheme based on the characteristic map of the compressor. taking into account inlet disturbances.

1326172,Modelling the impacts of investors' decision making on decarbonisation pathways in industry,,Sara Budinis and Sara Giarola and J Sachs and AD Hawkes,,,,,IAMC,The Paris Climate agreement calls for dramatic changes in the energy system. This will be challenging for demand sectors like industry. which is notoriously energy intensive. Although increased efficiency has proven to be suitable options to reduce energy and environmental impacts. stringent regulations on carbon will require this sector to undergo an unprecedented innovation effort. which will go well beyond cost efficiency measures to include the deployment of novel technologies and. most likely. of carbon capture and storage (CCS). This manuscript focuses on the uptake of novel technologies in the industrial sector and the barriers which might prevent or slow down the pace of innovation. Some of these barriers are technological as they depend on the availability and the technology readiness level of a specific technology. Others are instead related to the attitude that investors show towards innovative and the inherent level of risk. Among the many innovation options in the industrial sector. the focus here is on the uptake of the carbon capture and storage technologies.

These considerations include mixture design. consolidation. curing. and cracking. One important parameter in the service life modeling of concrete has been the resistance to fluid transport through the concrete. This has often been called the permeability of the concrete as described by the effective diffusion coefficient. Only a few current methods to measure fluid penetration exist and have been either not accurate or costly and time-consuming. This work focused on developing a new test method that can be used in the lab or the field to determine the service life of the concrete. The CHIP (checking ion penetration) is a practical. fast. safe. and inexpensive approach to x-ray image concrete. mortar. or cementitious paste. This prototype was developed by adapting existing dental x-ray equipment and the use of tracers to observe the fluid penetration into paste. mortar. and concrete.

This work focused on developing the conceptual design. obtaining the materials and constructing the prototype. and then completing a case study. This prototype has the potential to give DOTs an inexpensive and powerful tool to help them rapidly investigate the performance of their concrete infrastructure.

Las emisiones a la atmósfera provocadas por el ser humano. junto con otras emisiones de efecto invernadero. metano por ejemplo. han sobrepasado la capacidad del planeta para almacenar carbono en los bosques. los océanos y la biomasa viva y muerta. La solución al problema debe basarse en la reducción de las emisiones de carbono originadas por el ser humano y en el aumento de la capacidad de absorción de carbono (o en ambas opciones). La mayoría de las discusiones sobre política climática habitualmente centran el tema. con razón. en la reducción de las emisiones industriales–las emisiones industriales representan alrededor del 70% del total de gases de efecto invernadero (GEI) y es prácticamente imposible imaginar formas de absorber y almacenar tanto exceso de carbono. Pero también es cierto que áreas no industriales. que incluyen actividades forestales y agrícolas. representan en torno al 30% de las emisiones. La agricultura y la silvicultura poseen un importante potencial para almacenar el exceso de carbono–esto no es suficiente para resolver el problema. pero sí puede contribuir significativamente a cualquier política sistemática de solución. Por este motivo se ha empezado a prestar atención a los temas relacionados con el uso de la tierra. la silvicultura y la agricultura–algunas veces denominadas como REDD (reducción de emisiones de la deforestación y la degradación) o. más ampliamente. como LULUCF (Uso de la Tierra.

El trabajo analiza los determinantes empíricos del ahorro privado usando como soporte un panel de datos sobre 21 países de la OCDE para el período 1964-2001. De entre los factores considerados. se presta especial atención a la significación y magnitud del impacto de las variables asociadas a la política fiscal implementada en cada país. Al nivel general de la OCDE. a partir de la muestra de datos utilizados. los resultados confirman la existencia de un trade-off significativo entre los ahorros público y privado. y también que un incremento en los gastos corrientes del gobierno tiene un efecto negativo sobre el ahorro privado. independientemente del hecho de que dicho aumento genere o no desahorro público. De las variables macroeconómicas introducidas. sólo la tasa de crecimiento real de las economías afecta de forma significativa y positiva al ahorro privado. mientras que entre las variables financieras. tanto el tipo de interés real como la tasa de stock de dinero en circulación aportan información débilmente relevante. siendo en cualquier caso su impacto negativo bastante reducido. Finalmente. de las variables demográficas introducidas sólo la tasa de urbanización ejerce un efecto significativo. y positivo. a la hora de explicar las variaciones de las tasas de ahorro privadas en los 21 países de la OCDE considerados.

Several recent studies have rejected the lifecycle-permanent income hypothesis using aggregate time series. The rejection of the theory has often been blamed on the restrictive assumptions adopted in order to test the hypothesis. This article tests the household behaviour using cohort data from the Spanish Encuesta Continua de Presupuestos Familiares (Continuous Survey of Household Budgets). This source allows us to relax some of the most restrictive assumptions by using data with a certain degree of disaggregation. Evidence of consumer behaviour following the theory is found.

Spain,2020,Esteban Thomasz and Ismael Pérez-Franco and Agustín García-García,12,Sustainability,18,7254,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper presents an evaluation of the economic cost of precipitation shortage in the production of lamb in Extremadura. Given that the production strategy is based on maintaining a productivity target by supplementing natural pastures in contexts of water scarcity. the approach will be based on the analysis of the cost structure of the sector. A monetized cash flow model will be presented. which allows us to evaluate economic impacts through a financial perspective. The study focuses on a set of 1583 farms associated into the cooperative EA Group. These members have a total of 804.000 animals. which represents more than 40% of total sheep in Extremadura. Results shows a relation between precipitation minimums and feed quantity maximums of the series analyzed. Mayor direct impact is represented by an increase in feed supplementation needs. with an economic estimation of 54 million euros over two years for the whole sector. At the farm level. there is an average reduction of profits of 50% in the case of owned land. and bankruptcy in the case of renting land. In the context of data-driven policy making. this estimate provides a tool for European Policy funding negotiation a in sector which is considered as highly strategic because of its positive impacts on the environment. the generation of employment and maintenance of rural populations in marginal areas and for the production of high-quality food with a minimal use of natural resources.

On the one hand. we look at the energy transition laws introduced by the EU and other countries. On the other. we conduct a causal analysis of energy consumption and economic growth to confirm whether the change of energy model has generated positive effects on economic growth. The procedure was as follows. First. we conducted an aggregate causality analysis exploring the relationship between growth and energy consumption. As the results were not significant. we repeated the analysis with different disaggregations of renewable energy sources. With respect to solar thermal energy and economic growth. the main conclusion is that the data appear to show a one-way causal relationship for Portugal and EU-26 (European Union without Portugal and Spain) and a two-way relationship for Spain.

We were able to provide confident predictions of several future prices by processing a set of past data. Different model structures were tested. The influence of subjective economic and political decisions on price evolution leads to complex behavior that is hard to forecast. We analyzed correlations with different economic variables related to the price of CO 2 emission allowances and found the behavior of two to be similar: electricity prices and iron and steel prices. They. along with CO 2 emission allowance prices. were included in the forecasting model in order to verify whether or not this improved forecasting accuracy. Only slight improvements were observed. which proved to be more significant when their respective time series trends or fluctuations were used instead of the original time series. These results show that there is some sort of link between the three variables. suggesting that the price of CO 2 emission allowances is closely related to the time evolution of the price of electricity and that of iron and steel. which are very pollutant industrial sectors. This can be regarded as evidence that the CO 2 market is working properly.

Dev,,05-07,,The problem of hydro-abrasive erosion due to sediment is becoming more severe for hydropower plants owing to recent increase in energy demand especially in geologically young mountains. such as the Andes and the Himalaya and extreme flood caused due to climate change. In high head Pelton turbines. even small sediment particles cause critical hydro-abrasion. The effect of different parameters involved in hydro-abrasive erosion is not fully understood as the abrasion tests provide widely varying results. Though it is more appropriate to conduct an abrasion test that resembles the prototype plant conditions. but. no abrasion test rig is reported till now to provide reliable results. The paper presents recent hydro-abrasive studies in Pelton turbine followed with detailed discussion on approaches and findings. Based on the conclusions; a new test rig is proposed to simulate hydro-abrasive conditions in laboratory similar to Pelton turbine actually installed. The proposed study takes into consideration influencing factors like erosion velocity. sediment concentration and sediment size. The paper describes the test rig and erosion measurement methodology. The initial erosion measurement test using proposed methodology shows improved result in comparison to the other previously reported applied measurement techniques for hydroabrasive erosion. The erosion methodology provides an added advantage of measuring depth and volume of erosion over an area of cross-section. which was not considered in case of weight loss method.

By examining energy policies from the nineteen-seventies. an additional perspective is gained into situations where the costs of cooperation—and benefits of free-riding—are high. This provides a contrast with relatively easier cases like ozone depletion. where costs are low. benefits are high. and the incentives to participate and comply are both obvious and simple to modify. Such an approach can better explain persistent puzzles concerning divergences in policies relating to global public goods and common-pool resources. as well as to energy use and prices.

1326237,Testing Liberalism Seriously: Can Attitudes Predict Outcomes for Environmental and Climate Policies,2009,Robert Shum,,Trabajo presentado en el congreso celebrado por la International Political Science Association (IPSA) en Santiago de Chile,,,,What are the implications of liberal theory and its assumptions regarding policy-making on climate change? By building upon a median-voter model of environmental policy-making and developing an extension to include citizen tastes. we test the effects of tastes. institutions and resource endowments on overall environmental performance and specific climate policy outcomes measured according to the Environmental Policy Index (EPI). The results provide evidence of significant effects for the former but not the latter. For climate policy. only resource endowments appear to have an effect. The remainder of the paper seeks to explain this anomaly through an analysis of events that took place during the process of negotiating an international agreement on climate change. By comparing this observed process to the hypothetical logic and dialectic of liberal theory. we conclude that the dynamics of the climate change problem are fundamentally different from those proposed by Kant: that a security dilemma consequently leads to efforts to establish collective security among republics. for reasons including commercial self-interest. Yet the climate dilemma is not the security dilemma. since commercial self-interest does not dictate that states should rationally cooperate to limit carbon emissions. Efforts to enforce cooperation against climate change will require a transformation of incentives that currently do not encourage participation and compliance in a state’s own self-interest.,True,9w__mtEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15117350071543130396&hl=en&oi=scholarr,15117350071543130396,/scholar?cites=15117350071543130396,,,,0,0,0

This paper examines two cases of normative change in international relations concerning the norm of territorial integrity and its evolution during the nineteen-seventies. In contrast to a single-case study approach. this paper compares processes in two regions providing variance in state practice and the robustness of the norm. Eastern Europe and the Middle East. in order to understand the role of norms in a larger context of multiple forces and their collective interactions. By comparing negotiations concerning the norm of territorial integrity during the period of détente and the Arab-Israeli wars. we can examine how the content of norms. and especially the scope of exceptions to a norm. are influenced by power differences and the formation of alliances willing to ensure compliance. In other words. norms are a consequence. as well as a cause. of change in the international system. especially in terms of the system’s capacity to sanction. The implications for ongoing efforts in normative change such as those to prevent climate change are that any effective agreement must enable the system to restructure incentives through both coordination and the development of linkages so as to provide the material leverage necessary for inducing changes in state policies and individual behaviour.,True,9w__mtEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/Sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1449624,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Shum/publication/228151212_Norms_Are_What_the_System_Makes_of_Them_Helsinki%27s_Lessons_for_Normative_Diplomacy_on_Climate_Change/links/5d016b8da6fdccd13096915a/Norms-Are-What-the-System-Makes-of-Them-Helsinkis-Lessons-for-Normative-Diplomacy-on-Climate-Change,0,0,0

Throughout these changes the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) have also seen significant shifts in their legitimacy'as institutions. Many groups. especially those who feel that they do not have a voice in the WTO. even though it significantly affects their interests. are alleging that the international trade system is suffering from many defects. Over time. these groups' demands for greater representation. participation. and accountability have grown more insistent. Fundamentally. these demands reflect the perception that the WTO is more a captive bureaucracy than an intergovern-mental arrangement of agreements. understandings. and mechanisms designed to facilitate greater trade and prosperity. These opposing perspectives represent pos-sible organizational destinies that Ivan Head predicted long ago would begin to characterize international organizations as their activities developed and expanded: on the one hand. the international trade system may indeed represent an effort to evolve a'brilliant patchwork'of laws and other instruments to help nations cope with growing economic interdependence; on the other hand. it may also evolve into a dysfunctional and unaccountable bureaucratic entity. one that is characteristic of so many'which now rest upon the international community as an increasingly insupportable burden'.?

In an SAPG plant. heat exchangers (termed as solar preheaters. SP) facilitate the heat exchange between solar heat and feedwater. Depending on the locations of the SPs in the power plant. an SAPG plant can have different configurations. In order to respond to solar variations. SAPG plants can be controlled using different approaches. The performance of SAPG plants with different configurations and controlled using a different approach has been compared by using real solar radiation data from Adelaide. Australia. Solar radiation data from two consecutive periods of five days during summer and winter were used for simulation. The results show that the performances of the SAPG plant with different configurations and approaches to control are different. and there is an optimum configuration and approach to control for the SAPG plant.,True,9ZsZSdYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,0,http://proceedings.ises.org/paper/swc2015/swc2015-0079-Qin.pdf,,,,,http://proceedings.ises.org/paper/swc2015/swc2015-0079-Qin.pdf,0,0,0

This paper presents the development of an integrated costing model to assess the impact of degraded water treatment. as well as the implications of increased tube scaling in the main condenser. The model developed herein is used to perform case studies of various treatment. condenser cleaning and condenser configurations to provide insight into the ramifications of degraded water use in the cooling loops of thermoelectric power plants. Further. this paper lays the groundwork for the integration of relationships between degraded water quality. scaling characteristics and volatile emission within a recirculating cooling loop model.,True,dp0kVgcAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1036504,,,,,,0,0,0

Estimates have shown that a large part of the human population will not have access to clean drinking water in a couple of decades from now. Collection of fog can be a useful solution to this concern. Fog. a large source of potable fresh water. has potentials to substitute traditional sources. Attempts have been made over the last few decades to capture fog from nature by installing large fog water collectors along coastal mountains and highlands. However. fog harvesting from artificial fog generators were not envisaged in these studies. In this pilot study. we have explored the possibilities of fog capture from CT (cooling tower) plume in a thermal power plant; CT plume accounts for one of the major sources of industrial water losses.

Criteria of performance relevant to the individual components are formulated. Exergy flows. exergy consumption due to irreversibilities and rational performance parameters for the turbine cycle and its components are computed by using plant operation data under different conditions. Energy efficiency of the turbine cycle is low due to large energy rejection. but the derived exergy efficiency of the turbine cycle is high due to low exergy rejection from the cycle. Part load operation exhibits lower energy efficiency due to higher energy rejection relative to net output.

1326286,Modeling of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer recommendations for maize (Zea mays L.) Grown on Alfisols of Northwestern Ethiopia,2004,YIHENEW MENGESHA G SELASSIE,,,,,,In Northwestern Ethiopia. population growth is rapid and there is a rapidly growing demand for food. Therefore. cultivation of subsistence crops must be stimulated and production augmented in a sustainable way. The trend in all research endeavors including research on soil nutrients. therefore. is going through a development process away from agricultural production per se towards sustainable production (Smaling and Oenema. 1998). Among others. mineral nutrition is becoming one of the most important factors for increasing maize production in Northwestern Ethiopia. Unfortunately. many soils of Ethiopian highlands are inherently poor in available plant nutrients and organic matter (Tekalign et al.. 1988). Murphy (1963) conducted a survey or rapid appraisal work to assess the fertility status of Ethiopian soils and concluded that the major part of Ethiopian soils is deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus. Hence. farmers who attempted to grow crops without or with marginal fertilizer application could not produce enough even to feed their own family for one year. As in other soils of Ethiopia. nitrogen is probably more often deficient than any other essential element in Alfisols. mainly because organic matter of these soils is not preserved (Mesfm. 1998). In addition to this. the cereal dominated cropping systems. aimed at meeting the farmers’ subsistence requirements. coupled with low usage of chemical fertilizers have led to the widespread depletion of soil nitrogen in the maize growing areas of Ethiopia.

Eng.,,451-461,,Synthetic soils are being contemplated for replacing natural sandy soils in particular engineering applications such as recreational trails and sport arenas. In the case of sport surfaces. synthetic soils contain artificial additives that aim at reducing risks of athlete injuries by enhancing and stabilizing the shear strength and drainage properties of natural soils. For example in synthetic horseracing tracks. sandy soils coated with wax were found to achieve desirable mechanical properties during wet and dry weather conditions. Natural sandy soils have mechanical and hydraulic properties that strongly depend on their dry density and water content during compaction. When coated with wax. these synthetic soils exhibit new attributes such as decreased water retention. lower dry density. and improved drainage characteristics. However wax-coated soils are new materials with poorly understood engineering properties. This study investigates the effects of compaction on the shear strength of wax-coated sands based on a series of compaction tests and direct shear tests. Based on the experimental results obtained on a particular wax-coated soil. the study infers that the wax coating renders the shear strength of sandy soils less susceptible to changes in water content. and slightly increases the shear strength at low pressure without affecting significantly the internal friction.,True,oxtaSQgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,15,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nima_Jabbari/publication/268031483_Effects_of_Compaction_on_Shear_Strength_of_Wax-Coated_Sandy_Soils/links/553e99780cf20184050f89a3.pdf,10489588581755045719,/scholar?cites=10489588581755045719,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nima_Jabbari/publication/268031483_Effects_of_Compaction_on_Shear_Strength_of_Wax-Coated_Sandy_Soils/links/553e99780cf20184050f89a3.pdf,0,0,0

The purpose of this research is to investigate the environmental impacts of mining activities in the vicinity of Meiduk copper mine. In this study. we use the pollution indices such as contamination factor. enrichment factor and geo-accumulation index for evaluating the metal contaminants. including Pb. Ni. Se. Mo and Zn. The fieldwork consisted of 60 surface soil samples drawn at the depth of 0-30 cm. The samples were. then. analyzed for metals using ICP-MS method. Principal component analysis of compositional data (PCA) was also applied as a multivariate method to find relationships among metals.

Design and investment decisions related to ITS message signs. radio advisories. lane capacity. clear zones. width of lanes and medians. and traffic signals are disaggregated into groups of connected. autonomous and connected automated environments and series of recommendations are provided to PennDOT and State DOTs alike to prepare for and manage the new technologies. Furthermore. a timeline is suggested for the recommended actions to help plan accordingly. The paper discusses a number of key uncertainty factors related to demand requiring state DOTs to make decisions that are robust under a range of conditions. The paper concludes that most decisions impacting State DOTs in the near term will be related to connectivity and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) technologies such as those related to traffic signals. As technologies progress State DOTs will need to follow the market driven forces while being cautious on new investment decisions that …,True,QlT79MgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,7,https://trid.trb.org/view/1337654,8886024728247080846,/scholar?cites=8886024728247080846,,,,0,0,0

1326332,Impacts of vehicle automation on workforce training and driver’s licensing,2015,Yeganeh Mashayekh Hayeri and Corey Harper and Chris Hendrickson and Allen D Biehler,,,15-2492,,,Connected and autonomous vehicle technologies have the potential to significantly change surface transportation as it is known it today by providing greater mobility to users and improving driver safety by making driving easier and more efficient. As autonomous and connected vehicles begin to replace today’s manually operated vehicles. Automated Highway Systems will begin to replace current roadways and more electronic assist features and communication technologies will begin to appear in cars. In order for the transportation workforce to keep up with the changes in automobile technology. educational institutions must become part of the change. Along with changes to workforce training needs. the deployment of automated vehicles could also impact driver licensing skills testing criteria and driver’s education since the vehicle would be doing most of the driving instead of the human. This paper seeks to evaluate the impacts of connected and autonomous vehicle technologies on workforce training needs and driver’s licensing. In this paper. the authors will provide recommendations to community colleges and trade schools which offer certificates or training to transportation professionals as well as State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) on how policies. curriculum courses. or testing procedures will need to change as the nation’s surface transportation is moving toward automation.

Total CO2 emissions from the transportation sector are also growing more quickly than other sources of emissions. increasing 12 percent from 1990 to 2010 [5].Due to the extensive US effort for emission controls on motor vehicles from the 1970s onwards. external air emission costs are small relative to the overall cost of motor vehicle use including ownership. fuel. insurance. and depreciation. For example. in 2007 dollars. the National Research Council (NRC) estimated that external health effects for criteria air emissions (including SOX. NOx. CO. PM. VOC and NH3) was 1.3 to 1.4 cents per VMT for automobiles using gasoline (and 10 percent ethanol RFG E10)[24]. Other vehicle fuels had similarly low external costs. ranging from 1.1 to 1.2 cents per VMT for compressed natural gas to 1.5 to 1.6 cents per VMT for hybrid electric vehicles. Yet while the costs of external air emissions are small relative to the overall cost of driving. the total external costs imposed on society are substantial. In 2009. 3 trillion VMT [9] multiplied by the NRC [24] average external cost of 1.3 cents per VMT results in an estimated overall external cost of $40 Billion. and this does not include the costs of GHG emissions. Measures to reduce this social cost should be considered to decrease this burden. particularly on those who choose not to drive and did not contribute to the problem but must deal with the consequences. Costs of congestion exceed these air emission external costs. The Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) estimates that the cost of congestion was $101 billion in 2010. causing urban Americans to travel 4.8 billion hours more and to …,True,QlT79MgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/ndownloader/files/12254684,5329591085894376634,/scholar?cites=5329591085894376634,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/ndownloader/files/12254684,0,0,0

1326336,Surrounding Vehicles’ Contribution to Car-Following Models: A Deep-Learning Based Analysis,2021,Saeed Vasebi and Yeganeh M Hayeri and Peter J Jin,,,TRBAM-21-03521,,,Relatively recent increased computational power and extensive availability of traffic data have provided a unique opportunity to re-investigate drivers’ car-following (CF) behavior. Classic CF models assume drivers’ behavior is only influenced by their preceding vehicle. Recent studies have indicated that considering surrounding vehicles’ information (eg. multiple preceding vehicles) could impact the performance of CF models. An in-depth investigation of surrounding vehicles’ contribution to CF modeling performance has not been reported in the literature. This study uses a deep-learning model with long short-term memory (LSTM) to investigate to what extent considering surrounding vehicles could improve the performance of CF models. This investigation helps to select the right inputs for traffic flow modeling. Five CF models are compared in this study (ie. Classic. Multi-Anticipative. Adjacent-Lanes. Following-Vehicle. and All-Surrounding-Vehicles CF models). Performance of the CF models’ is compared in terms of accuracy. stability. and smoothness of traffic flow. The CF models are trained. validated. and tested by a large publicly available dataset. Results show insignificant performance differences between the Classic CF model and Multi-Anticipative model. or Adjacent-Lanes model in terms of accuracy. stability. or smoothness. The Following-Vehicle CF model shows similar performance to the Multi-Anticipative model.

1326337,The Takeover Conundrum: Level 3 Vehicle Automation Behavioral Study,2021,Yeganeh M Hayeri and Anurag Gade and Christine LaRochelle and Hojat Behrooz,,,TRBAM-21-02788,,,This study analyzes the safety aspects of integrating level 3 (L3) Automated Driving System (ADS) on public roads. According to the Society of Automotive Engineers. L3 ADS is defined as a driving system capable of sustaining driving functions within its operational domain with the expectation that the fallback ready user is receptive to any request to intervene. The time it takes the fallback ready user to regain the control of the vehicle from when the ADS posts the fallback request to when the human driver intervenes is known as the takeover time. including perception. cognition. and motor-readiness. Previous research suggests that neither perception nor motor-readiness changes significantly from one individual to another; hence takeover time is mainly dependent on the cognition phase of the reaction. This study utilizes two surveys to evaluate the elemental personality traits of the drivers and see how they affect the takeover times across driving style. age. and gender. The goal is to identify which group (s) of human drivers are the safest drivers to serve as the early adopters of L3 ADS. It was discovered that the personality traits of the need for arousal. need for learning. conscientiousness. and win-at-all-costs all have an impact on the average take-over times. whereas emotional instability and need for body resources do not have a significant impact on it. Additionally. it was found that women age 31 to 35 years are the most cautious drivers and perhaps the most suitable group for early adoption of L3 ADS on public roads.,True,QlT79MgAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://trid.trb.org/view/1759843,,,,,,0,0,0

1326340,Investigating Taxi and Uber competition in New York City: Multi-agent modeling by reinforcement-learning,2020,Saeed Vasebi and Yeganeh M Hayeri,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.12530,,,,The taxi business has been overly regulated for many decades. Regulations are supposed to ensure safety and fairness within a controlled competitive environment. By influencing both drivers and riders choices and behaviors. emerging e-hailing services (eg. Uber and Lyft) have been reshaping the existing competition in the last few years. This study investigates the existing competition between the mainstream hailing services (ie. Yellow and Green Cabs) and e-hailing services (ie. Uber) in New York City. Their competition is investigated in terms of market segmentation. emerging demands. and regulations. Data visualization techniques are employed to find existing and new patterns in travel behavior. For this study. we developed a multi-agent model and applied reinforcement learning techniques to imitate drivers behaviors. The model is verified by the patterns recognized in our data visualization results. The model is then used to evaluate multiple new regulations and competition scenarios. Results of our study illustrate that e-hailers dominate low-travel-density areas (eg. residential areas). and that e-hailers quickly identify and respond to change in travel demand. This leads to diminishing market size for hailers. Furthermore. our results confirm the indirect impact of Green Cabs regulations on the existing competition. This investigation. along with our proposed scenarios. can aid policymakers and authorities in designing policies that could effectively address demand while assuring a healthy competition for the hailing and e-haling sectors.,True,QlT79MgAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12530,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12530,0,0,0

Light-Duty Automated Vehicles in US Metropolitan Areas,2019,Saeed Vasebi and Yeganeh M Hayeri,,,19-05682,,,Automobile air emission causes immediate and long-term effects on the environment. Reducing environmental costs of automobiles’ air emission is an important social goal. This study evaluates air emissions and fuel cost savings of low-level automated vehicles in 86 metropolitan areas in the US based on county specific external air emission morbidity. mortality and agricultural costs. Twelve low-level automated technologies were investigated to estimate their impacts on fuel consumption. CO₂. CO. NOₓ. PM₂. ₅. SOₓ. NH₃. and VOC. The authors developed a framework to analyze automated technologies direct and indirect impacts: accident-related congestion reduction. non-accident-related congestion reduction. aerodynamic force reduction. equipment’s operational load. and traffic rebound. The results show Low-level automated vehicles could reduce the total air emissions’ marginal cost up to 25 billion USD2016 and gasoline consumption up to 18 billion USD2016 in the 86 US metropolitan areas annually. This study further reveals automated vehicles result in different environmental cost savings per vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in different metropolitan areas. New York-Newark. Chicago. and Atlanta have the highest environmental cost savings per VMT. Each low-level automated technology’s performance also varies from one metropolitan area to another. For example. adaptive cruise control and cooperative adaptive control result in the highest cost savings in New York-Newark. while parking aid system and dynamic route guidance provide the highest cost savings in Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana.

The authors model car-following behavior using decision-theoretic techniques. The authors assume the driver is a decision maker acting based on a utility function that assigns the degree of desirability of the driving situation. The method is to use inverse problem in control theory. also known as inverse reinforcement learning in a more modern terminology in machine learning. The authors use a publicly available dataset on the car-following behavior known as the Bosch dataset. which includes headway distance. speed and acceleration data. The simulation results discover the reward function that makes the actual driving behavior in the data preferable to any other behavior. Understanding such behaviors and preferences is becoming crucial as the authors are entering the modern era of transportation automation. Considering drivers’ preferences while designing for automation features would improve the safety and efficiency of the driving environment while ensuring desirable and comfortable setting for those inside the vehicles.,True,QlT79MgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://trid.trb.org/view/1394066,,,,,,0,0,0

A common mitigation paradigm is to consider strategy'wedges' that can be applied to different activities to achieve desired GHG reductions. In this report. the authors consider a wide range of possible travel demand reduction and traffic congestion management strategies to reduce light-duty vehicle GHG emissions. To estimate the cost savings associated with the implementation of various travel demand and traffic congestion management strategies. performance measures such as speed. delay. and travel time were assessed for each strategy. These performance measures were then combined with emission factors–amount of pollutants per speed interval–and monetary damage values of each pollutant in terms of mortality. morbidity and environmental damages–dollar per gram of pollutant–to estimate the external environmental cost savings resulting from the implemented strategy. Fuel and time cost savings were simply measured by incorporating the value of time and fuel. Specifically. the external environmental cost of driving in the US including congestion was estimated to be about $110 billion annually. Brownfield developments and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified brownfield developments were assessed as land use and travel demand management strategies to reduce vehicular travel demand.

The temperature of both absorbing surface has been measured during the test day. from sunrise to sunset. Temperature distribution has been analyzed using a thermal camera. Experimental results show a good correlation between measured temperatures on the absorbing surfaces and values of the incident solar radiation measured with a fixed and a sun tracking pyranometer. The spherical absorbing surface is behaving like a sun tracking surface. during the day a hemisphere is exposed to sun and the other hemisphere is shaded. The overall daily average temperature on the spherical absorber is smaller than on the flat plate absorber. suggesting that the spherical absorber is not efficient as a solar radiation capturing surface.,True,J16xshAAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610215028921,18124149786638155479,/scholar?cites=18124149786638155479,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610215028921/pdf?md5=eb587b8bf9ff711c55901ecb2bc0b47e&pid=1-s2.0-S1876610215028921-main.pdf,0,0,0

Research on this fuel finds limited studies with little to no information regarding a second law heat release analysis and contrasting findings with respect to NOx emissions. This effort rectifies these issues by performing experiments with ULSD and WCO biodiesel on a single cylinder compression ignition engine running at constant speed (2000 rpm) and various loads (0. 25. 50. 75. and 100% load). The combustion timing of WCO biodiesel was normalized to match the peak in-cylinder pressure timing of ULSD. Generally.

Power Plant and Land Morphology. a Case Study of Prishtina,2017,Bujar Bajcinovci,19,Environmental and Climate Technologies,1,65–74,De Gruyter,Environmental air pollution is a global health concern. a complex phenomenon which is directly reflected on public health. economic and human development. Environmental air pollution has been drastically multiplied. followed by the beginning of the new Millennia in Prishtina. the capital city of the Kosovo. The new millennium began as a crucial activity for the city of Prishtina in terms of demographic. human geography. social and economic phenomena. The presented study aims to determine prevalent traffic and land morphology composition attributes. which have influenced and continue to have environmental impact in the city of Prishtina. According to the conceptual findings from the empirical observations. the heavy city traffic and the land morphology structure. determine the urban air pollution level. Prishtina is generally polluted due to its geomorphic position in relation to the power plants Kosovo A. and Kosova B.

Those efforts are best documented in the architectural structure everywhere. starting from ancient history to the present. It is assumed that the town of Ulcinj is one of the earliest cities on the Adriatic coast. The building morphology and urban structure of Ulcinj is 2.500 years old and is continued by multi-ethnical society. Hence. the urban structure of Ulcinj developed harmonically across the rock hills which encompass the city beach. forming the urban structure which is perceived as the unity of land and sea. The study investigates the Ulcinj urban structure. urban management. sustainable development. focusing on human comfort. and environmental actions with a view to accomplish better and more natural life. Bioclimatic passive design principles are associated with an environmental sustainable design. interrelated to the microclimate of the region. connected to the thermal. spatial. visual. acoustic. and air quality. The research method consists of empirical observation through the city and riviera.

It is a huge problem encountered by the citizens of the city of Prishtina. too. The benefit from the cheapest forms of energy. that generated from coal-fired power plants. and the one derived from the low financial cost. raises the question: do we have to compensate this energy with our health? This paper presents the analysis of the emanations. such are coal-fired power plants in the vicinity of the city of Prishtina. and aims to determine the accepted level and health framework boundaries for coal-fired power plants and coal processing activities. The research methods consist of empirical observations and data analysis on health degradation. environmental and greenhouse gas contribution to the climate change. The actual state of energy production is not the most effective pathway to the stability of basic load for energy. Hence. the debate focused around environment tends to fail the essential need for supplying Kosovo with electricity. something for which power plants are suitable.

Historically. Kosovo's industry has gone through various stages of its development and fully dependent on the economic system. In general. Kosovo's industrial development was based on the exploitation of raw materials and their processing to a certain degree. but not to a satisfactory degree of processing and finalization. Industrial complexes in recent decades ‘moved’their traditional location of the suburban settlement and started a new phenomenon of industry selection locations even close to the city. Moreover. we have recently faced a lack of green spaces. and as a result we have come to the situation of redefining many urban architectural concepts. demanding free surfaces for non-degrading environmental industries in the urban zones. The industry today as a secondary economic activity is represented by 30% of production.

Singapore,,305,,Inhomogeneous MT (IHMT) shows promise for myelin-selectivity. Images acquired with soft prepulses at positive and negative offsets simultaneously show a reduced intensity compared to images with a single positive or negative offset prepulse. The leading hypothesis is that this works due to inhomogeneous broadening of the lipid proton line. Our results contradict this. We show that IHMT can be explained by a simple spin-1 model of a coupled methylene pair. and that it occurs in homogeneously-broadened systems (hair and wood). We propose the relevant timescales for IHMT are the dipolar coupling correlation time and the prepulse nutation period.,True,G1K--xAAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,3,https://index.mirasmart.com/ISMRM2016/PDFfiles/0305.html,12314656887616977516,/scholar?cites=12314656887616977516,,,https://index.mirasmart.com/ISMRM2016/PDFfiles/0305.html,0,0,0

In tissue. successive approximations. from the solvation layer model to the two pool model. have highlighted how longitudinal magnetization evolution depends on both inter-compartmental exchange and spin–lattice relaxation. In white matter. however. these models fail to capture the behaviour of the two distinct aqueous pools. myelin water and intra/extra-cellular water. A challenge with testing more comprehensive multi-pool models lies in directly observing all pools. both aqueous and non-aqueous.

1326417,T₁ relaxation and inhomogeneous magnetization transfer in brain: physics and applications,2018,Alan Patrick Manning,,,,,,Description A major goal of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) community is quantifying myelin in white matter. MRI contrast depends on tissue microstructure. so quantitative models require detailed understanding of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) physics in white matter's complex. heterogeneous environment. In this thesis. we study the underlying physics behind two different ¹H contrast mechanisms in white and grey matter tissue: T₁ relaxation and the recently developed inhomogeneous Magnetization Transfer (ihMT). Using ex-vivo white and grey matter samples of bovine brain. we performed a comprehensive solid-state NMR study of T₁ relaxation under six diverse initial conditions. For the first time. we used lineshape fitting to quantify the non-aqueous magnetization during relaxation. A four pool model describes our data well. matching with earlier studies. We also show examples of how the observed T₁ relaxation behaviour depends upon the initial conditions. ihMT's sensitivity to lipid bilayers. like those in myelin. was originally thought to rely upon hole-burning in the supposedly inhomogeneously-broadened lipid lineshape. Our work shows that this is incorrect and that ihMT only requires the presence of dipolar couplings. not a specific kind of line broadening. We developed a simple explanation of ihMT using a spin-1 system. Using solid-state NMR. we then performed measurements of ihMT and T₁D (dipolar order relaxation time) on four samples: a multilamellar lipid system (Prolipid-161). wood. hair. and bovine tendon. ihMT was observed in all samples. even those with homogeneous broadening (wood and hair …,True,G1K--xAAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,0,https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/24/24/items/1.0375841,,,,,https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/24/24/items/1.0375841,0,0,0

1326419,Nuclear Magnetic Resonance characterization of chiral nematic mesoporous films,2013,Alan P Manning,,,,,,Description Using templation with Nanocrystalline Cellulose (NCC). a mesoporous silica and organosilica film with a tunable chiral nematic pore structure and long. narrow pores has recently been developed. This novel material has interesting optical properties: it selectively reflects left-handed polarized light and has an iridescent appearance. with its perceived colour controlled by tuning the pitch of chiral structure. Its possible applications include enantioselective catalysis and filtering. and optical sensors. In this work. a variety of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments were run to characterize the films and composite systems. ¹³C and ²⁹Si Magic Angle Spinning NMR spectra confirmed removal of the NCC template via sulphuric acid and showed the process does not cleave organosilica bonds. NMR cryoporometry. which uses the signal from absorbed liquid water. relates freezing point depression to pore size. This method was found to be non-destructive. accurate. and more sensitive and precise than nitrogen sorption to determine pore sizes. The silica films were found to have a smaller (~ 3 nm) pore width size distribution than the organosilica films (~ 6-9 nm). Using Pulsed Field Gradient (PFG) NMR. the diffusion of absorbed water was found to be~ 2x as fast perpendicular to the surface normal than parallel to it. with diffusion parallel to the pore axis essentially unrestricted.

1326456,Aid and policy preferences in oil-rich countries: comparing Indonesia and Nigeria,2015,Ahmad Helmy Fuady,36,Third World Quarterly,7,,,This paper analyses the role of foreign aid in assisting development in two oil-rich countries: Indonesia and Nigeria. It seeks to understand the way foreign aid provided assistance to transform Indonesia from a ‘fragile’state in the 1960s into one of the ‘Asian Tigers’ in the mid-1990s. and why it did not prevent Nigeria from falling into ‘African Tragedy’. The paper argues that foreign aid may help not only to finance development. but also to navigate policy makers’ policy choices. It shows how foreign aid may or may not help policy makers turn their policy preferences into action.Indonesia and Nigeria have had contrasting experiences with foreign aid. Since the end of the 1960s Indonesia has received substantial foreign aid to finance its development programmes and projects. Meanwhile Nigeria received only limited foreign aid and therefore had to borrow short-term and high-interest-rate loans in the 1970s and 1980s. This paper analyses the role of foreign aid in assisting development in these two oil-rich countries. The two countries are similar in many respects. ranging from geography to economic. social and political challenges. but Indonesia has developed ‘better’than Nigeria since the end of the 1960s. The paper seeks to understand if and how foreign aid provided assistance to transform Indonesia from a ‘fragile’state into one of the so-called ‘Asian Miracles’ in the mid-1990s. and why foreign assistance could not prevent Nigeria during the same period from falling into what some term ‘African Tragedy’. 1 The important role of oil in Indonesia and Nigeria has invited frequent comparisons between these two countries. 2 Most such comparisons …,True,IYgqw8YAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,7,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/24245/1005886.pdf?sequence=1#page=93,17353054150755405619,/scholar?cites=17353054150755405619,,,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/24245/1005886.pdf?sequence=1#page=93,0,0,0

During this period. Indonesia was more successful than Nigeria in managing economic development. What did the Indonesian government do to successfully manage the economy that the Nigerian government did not do? Why did policy elites in the two countries choose different policies while facing similar economic challenges? The analysis focuses on these two questions. First. it examines the economic policies that led to the diverging economic performance of the two countries. Second. it examines potential factors that might explain this contrast in policy.Unlike previous studies that analyse the divergence using an institutional approach. this study proposes an alternative view: that Nigerian policy-makers were mistaken or misguided about what was necessary to achieve sustainable and equitable economic growth.

The end goal of the study is to develop a model of electricity access in remote area. We collected a baseline information as part of quasi experimental study at some villages. in Satar Mese sub-district. East Nusa Tenggara. The baseline data showed three major fnding. First. households with electricity access spent signifcantly less on kerosene. Second. access to electricity increases spending on non-food items signifcantly. Third. because the o? grid SEHEN program is for lighting. we do not obtain strong evidence for a causal relation between electricity access and increases in working hours. We found that access to electricity can improve peoples welfare through increasing spending on food and non-food spending. This mechanism can work because the price of SEHEN is relatively cheaper than kerosene light. Thus. people obtained extra saving on energy spending.

After unbundling and privatization of generation and distribution companies. not much improvement has been experienced by electricity consumers; this is due to lack of investment in infrastructure. Lack of investment in infrastructure especially from private investors is caused largely by non-cost reflective tariff among other factors highlighted in this study. While many believe tariff has to be controlled such that it does not go beyond the reach of average citizens. many also believe that the average citizens can pay much more than the current tariff. The latter is evident considering the average amount spend on the use of portable gasoline generators by most homes and small enterprises both in rural and urban centers. The whole life cost method is used to show here that it costs a home or business premise that operates a portable gasoline generator for 6 h daily NGN 37.000/ month and costs NGN 157.000 to operate 20 kVA diesel generator.

Previously. in solvent (Soxhlet) extraction. a narrow spectrum of solvents had been put to use in extraction. with hexane being the most popular and widely used choice solvent. Hence. the use of various extraction solvents in this research work is to show that hexane could be replaced with other solvents. Additionally. Solvents were combined in different combination ratios to show that oil yield could be improved by solvent combinations as opposed to using only single solvents. From the results obtained. it was ascertained that solvent combinations actually improved oil yields since the highest oil yields were obtained from the combination of Petroleum ether (100ml). Hexane (50ml) and methanol (50ml). having 50.667% and 51.33% with the combination of Hexane (100ml) and Methanol (100ml) as opposed to when only petroleum ether was used yielding 40.667%.

As a result various pretreatment methods have been developed to facilitate these bio-conversion processes. and this research focuses on the effect of two pretreatment methods such as liquid hot water and sulphuric acid pre-treatment to remove some of the components like lignin and hemicellulose which form structural barrier to enzymatic accessibility of cellulose in corn cobs and sawdust. The cellulosic materials were first dried in oven at 65 o C for 24 hours. and using solid to liquid ratio of 1: 10. the two methods were carried out at resident times ranging from 10-40 minutes. The liquid hot water method involved heating the cellulosic materials in water at 120 o C and 1atmosphere in a pressure vessel. and for the second method. the dried cellulosic materials were refluxed in 5% sulphuric acid at a temperature of 120 o C. Pretreated samples were filtered and liquid fractions were analyzed for the presence of reducing sugars. while solid residues were dried in the oven and weighed to measure the mass lost during pretreatment as a pointer to lignin breakdown. It was observed that the mass lost increased with time for both pretreatment methods. but the liquid hot water pretreatment gave higher lignin and hemicellulose removal when compared to the sulphuric acid pre-treatment.

1326560,Environmental impacts of biocides used in hydraulic fracturing,2018,Maria Fernanda Campa Ayala,,,,,,The goal of this dissertation was to better understand the environmental impacts of biocides used in unconventional oil and gas (UOG) practices. Specifically focusing on how industrial biocides may impact aquatic microbial communities. biocide degradation potential. and contribute to antimicrobial resistance propagation. Recently. the energy sector has seen a stark increase in biocide use. due to the dramatic growth in hydraulic fracturing (HF) operations. Biocides in HF are used to suppress microbial-induced corrosion. biofouling. and hydrogen sulfide production. The implications of biocide usage expansion. its impacts to antimicrobial resistance. and to environmental and public health risks are not fully understood. To understand these knowledge gaps. microcosm-based studies were used to investigate the effect of biocide addition to both HF-impacted and unimpacted streams. The two most common HF biocides. glutaraldehyde and 2-2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide (DBNPA). were used in two otherwise identical experiments. Degradation of the biocides and microbial community changes were measured over time. Results suggest that glutaraldehyde is more persistent in stream waters previously impacted by HF. However. the microbial community was able to tolerate it as shown by higher microbial diversity and biomass. The DBNPA microcosms experiment showed that previous HF impact. associated with higher total organic carbon. favors a less toxic and persistent DBNPA degradation pathway. Many unidentified brominated species were detected in both HF-impacted and unimpacted conditions.

Here we investigate the role of groundwater bacterial communities in the natural attenuation of DCM at an undisclosed manufacturing site in New Jersey. This study investigates the bacterial community structure of groundwater samples differentially contaminated with DCM to better understand the biodegradation potential of these autochthonous bacterial communities. Bacterial community analysis was completed using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of groundwater samples (n = 26) with DCM contamination ranging from 0.89 to 9.800.000 μg/L. Significant DCM concentration-driven shifts in overall bacterial community structure were identified between samples. including an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes within the most contaminated samples. Across all samples. a total of 6.134 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified. with 16 taxa having strong correlations with increased DCM concentration. Putative DCM degraders such as Pseudomonas. Dehalobacterium and Desulfovibrio were present within groundwater across all levels of DCM contamination. Interestingly. each of these taxa dominated specific DCM contamination ranges respectively. Potential DCM degrading lineages yet to be cited specifically as a DCM degrading organisms. such as the Desulfosporosinus. thrived within the most heavily contaminated groundwater samples.

The study tested three groups of 5 adjacent- or same-building-neighbours for 3 months. to measure how electricity demand (import) is affected by an in-home display issuing nudges and sanctions by the group around a simulated (limited capacity) shared solar and battery system. A control group of 6 homes’ energy data was obtained for the same period.

The method comprises the voter providing identity information to the supervisor. the supervisor verifying the identity of the voter and sending the identity information to a remote polling administrator service. which determines voter specific voting options to be presented to that voter. The method further comprises the polling administrator service sending details of the voter-specific voting options to the voting booth. the voting booth displaying the voting options to the voter. voting booth receiving voting information from the voter. and the voting booth sending the voting information to a vote processor.,True,ckj8xdYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,1,https://patents.google.com/patent/US20100049597A1/en,7540134057510922960,/scholar?cites=7540134057510922960,,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/32/a4/b6/d6c4042ba9c5be/US20100049597A1.pdf,0,0,0
1326620,Behaviour change via social sanctions and shared electricity,2018,Craig Burton and Seonad Candy and Behzad Rismanchi,,,,107–120,ZEMCH Network,Applying behaviour change methods to reduce home energy consumption has resulted in varying outcomes and also conservation effects that were short-lived. Some of the more promising treatments included In Home Energy Displays (IHDs) and home energy bills with comparisons to unknown others (Schultz. Nolan. Cialdini. Goldstein. & Griskevicius. 2007)-for individual homes. In contrast. so-called collective “energy communities” reduce individual energy consumption (Bauwens & Eyre. 2017) and report other benefits such as group cohesion and community building. A question arises as to whether conservation norms would emerge in ad-hoc urban groups if they we able to co-own and operate a Distributed Renewable Energy (DRE) asset. Secondly. can an economical DRE size for a small group be arrived at via demand aggregation and conservation together? The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology that will test this hypothesis. The approach is to deploy an IHD to display home energy consumption against the fictitious electricity available from a shared solar and battery system. as if it were installed. The IHD will also prompt group members among 6 neighbours to sanction or reward specific (but not identified) group members based on how they use the “shared energy”. A multiple baseline approach will be used and correlation of time series (energy consumption against user actions on the IHD) will be performed in R. We expect to observe a sustainable reduction in overall energy due to the effect of an IHD on occupant behaviour. The outcome of the study will help the community to scale the solar and battery storage …,True,ckj8xdYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,http://www.lowcarbonlivingcrc.com.au/sites/all/files/publications_file_attachments/burton_et_al._2018_-_behaviour_change_via_social_sanctions_and_shared_electricity_2.pdf,,,,,http://www.lowcarbonlivingcrc.com.au/sites/all/files/publications_file_attachments/burton_et_al._2018_-_behaviour_change_via_social_sanctions_and_shared_electricity_2.pdf,0,0,0

Each citizen can vote for both a single representative in the Legislative Assembly (LA) and a set of representatives in the Legislative Council (LC). Each LA representative is elected by IRV with compulsory complete preference listing. with rarely more than 10 candidates. Voters for the Legislative Council (LC) typically choose from among about 30 candidates.

The natural photosystem II (PS-II) embedded in the thylakoid membrane in plant leaves represents an excellent paradigm for designing an artificial photosynthesis device. since it shows how a self-repairing structural framework can be implemented to couple efficient charge separation with a fourstep proton-coupled electron-transfer pathway.[13. 14] Cyclic light-induced activation of P680 chlorophylls leads to the formation of a P680+ C cation radical by charge separation. The P680+ C is re-reduced by the oxidation of tyrosine Yz.

1326640,PREPARATION OF BETA-KETOAMINES CATALYZED BY COPPER ON BOEHMITE,,S Ganesh Babu and Brijith Thomas and R Karvembu,,,,,,Introduction β–Keto amines are a highly versatile class of intermediates for the synthesis of heterocycles and biologically active compounds [1]. Due to the importance of these compounds as intermediates in organic synthesis. a simple high yielding one-pot approach for this transformation is highly desirable. The most important and straight forward method involves the direct condensation of β-dicarbonyl compounds with amines at reflux in an aromatic solvent with azeotropical removal of water [2]. A variety of catalyst such as HCl. P-TSA. acetic acid. trimethylsilyltrifluoromethanesulonate (TMSTf). montmorillonite K10 under microwave irradiation or ultrasound. aluminum oxide. etc have been employed to effect this transformation. However these methods suffer from one or more drawbacks such as the use of expensive or less readily available reagents. vigorous reaction conditions. longer reaction times. unsatisfactory yields. low selectivity or the use of toxic solvents that limit these methods to small scale synthesis. But development of a convenient. environmentally benign. and highyielding catalytic system is highly desirable. Herein we report the synthesis of β-ketoamines in a solvent free condition using Cu/AlO (OH) as catalyst. this avoids the risk of the development of high internal pressure and provides a possibility of up-scaling the reaction under dry conditions. Moreover. reusability. stability and non toxicity of the catalyst are the note worthy advantages of this method.,True,xLppPIYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sundaram_Ganesh_Babu3/publication/282324037_Preparation_of_beta-Ketoamines_Catalyzed_by_Copper_on_Boehmite/links/560bc80b08aed467d7adb07b/Preparation-of-beta-Ketoamines-Catalyzed-by-Copper-on-Boehmite.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sundaram_Ganesh_Babu3/publication/282324037_Preparation_of_beta-Ketoamines_Catalyzed_by_Copper_on_Boehmite/links/560bc80b08aed467d7adb07b/Preparation-of-beta-Ketoamines-Catalyzed-by-Copper-on-Boehmite.pdf,0,0,0

Due to these conditions. diabetes patients have traditionally checked blood glucose levels through Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) techniques. like pricking their fingers multiple times per day. Such techniques involve a number of drawbacks that can be solved by using a device called Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM). which can measure blood glucose levels continuously throughout the day without having to prick the patient when carrying out every measurement. This article details the design and implementation of a system that enhances commercial CGMs by adding Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to them that allow for monitoring patients remotely and. thus. warning them about potentially dangerous situations. The proposed system makes use of smartphones to collect blood glucose values from CGMs and then sends them either to a remote cloud or to distributed fog computing nodes.

This paper focuses on the latter and presents the design and evaluation of a system for monitoring industrial workers that provides a near real-time decentralized response system aimed at reacting and tracing events that affect operator personal safety and health. Such a monitoring system is based on the information collected from sensors encapsulated in IoT wearables that are used to measure both personal and environmental data. The communications architecture relies on LoRaWAN. an LPWAN (Low-Power Wide-Area Network) technology that offers good reliability in harsh communications environments and that provides relatively long distance communications with low-energy consumption. Specifically. each wearable sends the collected information (eg. heart rate. altitude. external temperature. gas concentration. location) from the sensors to the nearest LoRaWAN gateway. which is transmitted to a pool of nodes where information is stored in a distributed manner. Such a decentralized system allows for providing information redundancy and guarantees its availability as long as there is an operative node. In addition. the proposed system is able to store and to process the collected data through smart contracts in a blockchain. which eliminate the need for a central backend and ensure the traceability and immutability of such data in order to share …,True,YG-vFYIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://www.mdpi.com/2504-3900/42/1/77,1694497150337703468,/scholar?cites=1694497150337703468,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2504-3900/42/1/77/pdf,0,0,0

For health reasons. such physical distancing requirements should be guaranteed in private and public spaces. In Spain. occupancy is restricted by law but. in practice. certain spaces may become overcrowded. existing law infringements in places that rely on occupancy estimations that are not accurate enough. For instance. although the number of passengers who enter a public transportation service is known. it is difficult to determine the actual occupancy of such a vehicle. since it is commonly unknown when and where passengers descend. Despite a number of counting systems existing. they are either prone to counting errors in overcrowded scenarios or require the active involvement of the people to be counted (eg. going through a lathe or tapping a card when entering or exiting a monitored area) or of a person who manages the entering/exit process. This paper presents a novel IoT occupancy system that allows estimating in real time the people occupancy level of public spaces such as buildings. classrooms. businesses or moving transportation vehicles. The proposed system is based on autonomous wireless devices that. after powering them on. do not need active actions from the passengers/users and require a minimum amount of infrastructure. The system does not collect any personal information to ensure user privacy and includes a decentralized traceability subsystem based on blockchain. which guarantees the availability. security and immutability …,True,YG-vFYIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1,https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4591/2/1/67,2454837155720461020,/scholar?cites=2454837155720461020,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4591/2/1/67/pdf,0,0,0

In addition. the hardware used by IoT devices has become more powerful and efficient. Such enhancements have made it possible to implement novel decentralized computing architectures like the ones based on edge computing. which offload part of the central server processing by using multiple distributed low-power nodes. In order to ease the deployment and synchronization of decentralized edge computing nodes. this paper describes an M2M distributed protocol based on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communications that can be executed on low-power ARM devices. In addition. this paper proposes to make use of brokerless communications by using a distributed publication/subscription protocol. Thanks to the fact that information is stored in a distributed way among the nodes of the swarm and since each node can implement a specific access control system. the proposed system is able to make use of write access mechanisms and encryption for the stored data so that the rest of the nodes cannot access sensitive information.

Savas Selamogulları,,,,,,In this study. constant-impedance. constant-current and constant-power ZIP models have been analyzed for residental loads. Measurement based approach has been used to obtain ZIP models of selected loads. The measurement-based approach for load modeling is important because it reflects the real dynamics of the system and represents the load characteristics more accurately. The ZIP model is used to estimate the power drawn by the load depending on the voltage changes. Since the ZIP load model is a well-known model that provides power dependence in terms of the physical sense of voltage. studies are taking place in this area. In this study. the voltage and power values of selected residental loads at YTU Smart Home Laboratory are measured.

Especially in the energy sector. countries use policy support to this end. A recent goal in this context is the formation of “lead markets”. which represents the idea that countries can build up first-mover advantages that will increase their competitiveness. Taking the lead in international diffusion of a particular innovation benefits a country’s industry through creating increasing returns of technological development and stimulating exports to expanding international markets. Interaction between national and international forces affecting renewable energy innovation and its diffusion has received fairly little attention so far. Here. we investigate the formation of lead markets for wind power technologies in China. Germany and the USA to see whether policy support of renewable energy innovation is capable of improving competitiveness. An extension of the current lead market framework is developed to include supply side factors and technology policy issues. The comparative analysis of lead market potential for wind power indicates a high level of internationalization of the industry with countries holding lead positions in specific parts the supply chain.

1326701,A mechanism-based explanation for blocking mechanisms in technological innovation systems,2020,Luiz Gustavo Silva De Oliveira and Juliana Subtil Lacerda and Simona O Negro,37,Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions,,18-38,Elsevier,Understanding “systemic problems” or “blocking mechanisms” in emerging technologies and industries has been a major issue in Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) research. Despite this literature’s long tradition. we show that a more accurate definition enhances the TIS framework explanatory power for a higher diversity of empirical cases. We posit that conceptual improvement depends on addressing the unclear or incomplete definitions and the lack of explanation of interdependent systemic problems and blocking mechanisms. To this end. we apply a mechanism-based approach to explore these conceptual limitations. As a result. we propose a causal conceptual framework that understands blocking mechanisms as causal pathways linking systemic problems (causes) to poor system functioning (outcomes). We also argue that detailing the causal pathway in activities and respective actors better explains …,True,EFoAOfgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210422420300940,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210422420300940,0,0,0

Using a dielectric barrier discharge we are able to create deposits from CO readily at atmospheric pressure conditions. Deposition rates are on the order of 0.2 mg min− 1 at power of 12 W corresponding to about 1000 kW-h kg− 1. Deposition rates increase with power although the most efficient deposition of carbon oxides is at lower power. Higher powers tend to increase the gas temperature and the carbon content of the films; this can be related to chemical kinetic considerations. Deposition rates are not significant functions of flow rate in the reactor. due to no significant depletion of the precursor over the range of flow rates tested.

1326713,Plasmachemical Synthesis of Carbon Suboxide,2012,Robert Geiger,,,,,,A nonthermal carbon monoxide plasma is known to produce a solid deposition which is thought to be a polymer of carbon suboxide (C3O2); however there are very few investigations of this deposition in the literature.  This thesis contains an analysis of the theoretical thermodynamics and kinetics of carbon suboxide formation as well as experimental results. The theoretical analysis suggests that carbon suboxide may be an equilibrium product even at ambient conditions but favors lower temperatures; furthermore if solid carbon is considered to be kinetically limited. and therefore not a product. then carbon suboxide is more likely to be a product under these pseudo-equilibrium conditions.  Experimentally. solid films were produced in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) containing pure carbon monoxide.  Optical emission spectroscopy was used to analyze the plasma and models of the emission spectra were created to determine the plasma temperatures.  Deposition rates were determined to be on the order of 0.2 mg/min at a power of about 10W; it is expected however that these conditions are not optimized.  The overall kinetics of carbon suboxide was analyzed and optimal conditions for operation can be estimated.  Characterization of the solid depositions were carried out using Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).  Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectroscopy (ESI-MS). and Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectroscopy (MALDI-MS).

1326721,Non-equilibrium Plasmas in Oil,2017,Robert Paul Geiger,,,,,,A non-equilibrium plasma can be generated in a liquid when the energy density is controlled. The process of initiating a plasma starting with a liquid phase can be initiated by applying a sufficiently large electric potential between a pair of electrodes submerged in the liquid. An electric field propagates between the electrodes at a rate that is only limited by the speed of light. Energy is subsequently transferred from the electric field to the liquid medium in various ways. Currently. the exact physical processes that occur after an electric field is present. and just prior to electrical breakdown. are not completely understood. During this prebreakdown process. charge multiplication is occurring. reactive species are being generated. and non-equilibrium plasma is being initiated. Once breakdown occurs. charge generation and reactive species production are further accelerated. thermal energy is rapidly dissipated in the dense medium and the plasma tends toward equilibrium. This plasma initiation process will proceed as far as it can. depending on the amount of energy being provided by the external circuit. Limiting the supply of energy will therefore determine the extent to which the plasma will achieve an equilibrium state.   Non-equilibrium and non-thermal plasmas can provide some rather unique chemistry. This dissertation explores. both theoretically and experimentally. the chemistry that occurs when non-equilibrium plasma is generated in oils. To generate consistent non-equilibrium plasma. a new technique. called the Electrodynamic Ball Discharge (EBD). is devised and analyzed.

Drexel Plasma Institute has developed a new type of fuel conversion reactor that utilizes a non-equilibrium gliding discharge (traditionally called ""Gliding Arc"" though it operates mostly in the glow discharge regime) in reverse vortex (""tornado""') flow. This reactor is universal in that it is capable of reforming both gaseous fuels and evaporated liquid fuels. such as diesel. gasoline. glycerol. etc. Gliding discharges are considered transitional discharges that combine non-equilibrium effects with relatively high power and controllable temperature to accelerate the partial oxidation chemical processes required for fuel conversion. Gliding discharge plasma is employed as a volumetric catalyst in the partial oxidation process to produce syngas (CO + H 2 ) from hydrocarbons.

1326727,Electric Field Effect on Pollutant Production for Industrial Combustion Application,,Robert Geiger and Jackson Pleis and Donald Kendrick,,,,,,Combustion of hydrocarbons produce ions through well-known chemi-ionization mechanisms [1. 2]. Ion production occurs predominately within the hottest zones of the flame. the flame front. When an external electric field is applied to a flame. free electrons are rapidly directed towards the anode leaving behind a positive space charge due to positive ions. This is because positive ions are slower to respond compared to the electrons due to their higher relative mass. Electronneutral collisions can lead to vibrational excitation and ionization at higher electric field strengths [3. 4]. As the positive ions move toward the cathode. they can obtain velocities between 50-100 m/s. depending on the field strength. Ion-neutral collisions can induce stagnation points and/or neutral velocities on the order of a about 5 m/s [5]. These effects can lead to increased mixing particularly from the flame front. Depending on the geometry and arrangement of the electrodes the combustion efficiency. pollutant production. and heat transfer can all be controlled due to these mechanisms. The objective of this research is to study electrical effects on industrial relevant flames. Electrical aspects of flames have been studied in laboratories for more than a century [6]. Observations have shown that electric fields can alter the flame speed. increase stability. increase heat transfer. reduce pollutants. and increase combustion efficiencies. However. the prospect for industrial application remains uncertain. Industrial flames are significantly different then the open-air. benchtop flames that are typically studied. Industrial flames are produced within furnaces creating much hotter environments …,True,TNFketwAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://avestia.com/MHMT2018_Proceedings/files/paper/CSP/CSP_104.pdf,,,,,https://avestia.com/MHMT2018_Proceedings/files/paper/CSP/CSP_104.pdf,0,0,0

Discharges are initiated when conducting particles. such as water droplets or metal balls. gain charge at an electrode immersed in the oil and then collide with one another. The interesting electrodynamics of this system provides a controllable method for the chemically processing of liquids. Three different discharge modes were identified including gas bubble discharges. microspark discharges and long spark chain discharges.

The question remains whether such a strategy could be successful in less-developed nations whose scientific and technological resources were relatively limited. This paper analyzes the trajectory of Chile. a Southern country which. despite adverse conditions. managed to produce something akin to an economic miracle during the last few decades. Our argument is that Chile’s success was based on the developmental network state strategy.

My strategy is to extend the applicability of the ‘developmental state’ concept to the post-communist context. Whereas the ‘developmental state’ model emphasizes the relationship between state bureaucrats and business groups. post-communist societies lacked a capitalist class at the beginning of transition. Using a concept developed by Mann (1989). I argue that capitalist development is associated with an increase in the infrastructural power of the state. This necessary condition is accompanied. in a late development context. by what I call ‘deliberative capacity’—the ability of the state managers to navigate between internal and external pressures in pursuing their goals.

Advocates have drawn attention to the central role of the labs in the development of technologies including advanced batteries. solar energy breakthroughs. imaging technologies. and various IT endeavors. among others. Critics have recurrently suggested that the labs’ innovative capacities have been undermined by a lack of engagement with commercial firms and managerial tactics. Perhaps surprisingly. what has often been missing from the debate is a thorough review of data on the public-private partnerships in which the labs engage with private firms. This paper draws on heretofore non-public data on one type of contractual arrangement–Work-For-Others (WFO) agreements–in which the labs perform contract work for private firms. We review 10 years of WFO data for a single DOE laboratory. Our analysis provides an initial picture of the surprisingly diverse geography and array of firms that employed the labs as contract R&D providers. as well as of key characteristics of these agreements. Although our data capture only a single laboratory’s agreements. the findings reinforce the importance of looking at the complex. overlapping network of programs within the US federal system that support private sector innovation.◆,True,GCWTtvQAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,5,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1517-45222017000300102&script=sci_arttext&tlng=pt,4446235144116080408,/scholar?cites=4446235144116080408,,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1517-45222017000300102&script=sci_arttext&tlng=pt,0,0,0

Grantees offer a wide array of prevention and intervention services. including case management. cognitive behavioral therapies. street outreach services. employment services. and other supports.Starting in 2017. PRNS contracted with Social Policy Research Associates (SPR) to evaluate the BEST program. SPR designed an evaluation covering an eight‐year period from program year (PY) 2010‐2011 to PY 2017‐2018 that includes an implementation study. an impact study. and a design for prospective evaluations of both BEST and the MGPTF. The study team collected data. including BEST grant management documents; San José Police Department data; and interview and focus group data from grantee staff. program participants. and key stakeholders.,True,GCWTtvQAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,https://www.spra.com/wordpress2/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/San-Jose-BEST-Final-Report-2019.pdf,,,,,https://www.spra.com/wordpress2/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/San-Jose-BEST-Final-Report-2019.pdf,0,0,0
1326752,The Always Embedded State: Six Types of State-Society Interaction.,2018,Marian Negoita,8,International Review of Social Research,2,,,This paper offers a critical analysis of the concept of embeddedness as currently used in political sociology and state theory. It argues that the concept of embeddedness can be successfully used to solve a current theoretical impasse-namely. how to conceptualize statesociety relations. The paper creates a conceptual space at the intersection of two axes of variation: the pattern of embeddedness (mono-versus multi-embeddedness) and the degree of state autonomy (captive versus autonomous). A central finding of this paper is that at least six types of embeddedness can be shown to exist in this conceptual space. In the remainder of the paper. the six types are described using a range of evidence extracted from the literature. One major advantage of the proposed typology is that it is able to incorporate. under the same umbrella. a variety of preexisting approaches of state-society interactions.,True,GCWTtvQAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=20698267&AN=136875167&h=umEW8TFSyE%2FTr32ioXCtZLP58Fbjwv5l%2Bb1a%2FSgmW7uKmJadW3zQ46f1UYebvNGrnYKbDXG0JTQi0CjkUoCuGQ%3D%3D&crl=c,,,,,,0,0,0
1326753,Como se dá a inovação dentro do Estado Desenvolvimentista em Rede? Novos dados sobre acordos público-privados em um laboratório do Departamento de Energia dos Estados Unidos,2017,Matthew R Keller and Fred Block and Marian Negoíta,19,Sociologias,46,,,A importância dos laboratórios nacionais do Department of Energy (DOE) para o sistema nacional de inovação dos EUA há muito tem sido tema de debate. Seus defensores destacam o papel central dos laboratórios no desenvolvimento de tecnologias como baterias avançadas. e os grandes progressos em energia solar. tecnologias de imagem e diversos empreendimentos em TI. entre outros. Seus críticos têm sugerido reiteradamente que a capacidade de inovação dos laboratórios vem se deteriorando por falta de parcerias com empresas comerciais e de táticas de gestão. O que–surpreendentemente. talvez-tem faltado nesse debate é uma revisão meticulosa dos dados sobre parcerias público-privadas entre os laboratórios e empresas privadas. Este artigo baseia-se em dados não públicos sobre um tipo de acordo contratual–os acordos Work-For-Others (WFO)(Trabalho-Para-Outros)–através dos quais o laboratório realiza um contrato de trabalho com empresas privadas. Revisamos 10 anos de dados dos WFO de um único laboratório do DOE. Nossa análise proporciona um panorama inicial da geografia surpreendentemente diversa e da gama de empresas que contrataram o laboratório como fornecedor de P&D. bem como de características chave desses acordos. Apesar de nossa coleta de dados compreender acordos de apenas um laboratório. os achados reforçam a importância de olhar a complexa e sobreposta rede de programas no sistema federal Americano que apoia a inovação no setor privado.,True,GCWTtvQAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://www.seer.ufrgs.br/sociologias/article/view/70796,,,,,https://www.seer.ufrgs.br/sociologias/article/viewFile/70796/45589,0,0,0
1326754,Evaluation of the Idaho Center of Excellence Healthcare Partnership (ICE),2016,Marian Negoita and Anne Paprocki and Miloney Thakrar,,,,,,The Idaho Center of Excellence Healthcare Partnership (ICE). funded by a Round Four Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College Career Training (TAACCCT) grant from the US Department of Labor (DOL). aims to transform educational delivery methods in Idaho and train more than 500 individuals for in‐demand healthcare jobs. The consortium is developing or enhancing programs nested in three distinct pathways—diagnostic services. health informatics. and therapeutic services—at three higher education institutions in Idaho: North Idaho College (NIC). the consortium lead; Idaho State University College of Technology (ISU); and Lewis‐Clark State College (LCSC).This document summarizes preliminary research findings from the evaluation of the ICE initiative. providing consortium members with a mid‐grant assessment of the consortium’s progress. main accomplishments. and promising practices. Overall. preliminary evidence indicates that the consortium is moving toward creating sustainable regional networks in which community colleges and industry partners collaborate to fill skills gaps in healthcare labor markets.,True,GCWTtvQAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,0,http://www.skillscommons.org/bitstream/handle/taaccct/18539/ICE%20Interim%20Final%20Report.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,,,,,http://www.skillscommons.org/bitstream/handle/taaccct/18539/ICE%20Interim%20Final%20Report.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0
1326755,Designing a Performance Measurement System for Career Pathways,2013,Marian Negoita and Kate Dunham,,,,,,This memo provides guidance for career pathways system collaboratives aiming to develop performance measurement systems. The goal of career pathways initiatives is to build intentional partnerships among education. workforce development. economic development. human services. and employer partners and. in so doing. create a system that contributes both to better educational achievement and to correspondingly higher incomes. and. therefore. to lower income inequality. After a brief description of what career pathways are and why they are necessary. we provide information on the types of measures that might be used in a performance system for career pathways. along with specific examples of such measures. Finally. we outline a recommended process for selecting and customizing a specific set of measures and metrics. along with some advice on how to set performance targets.Our thinking on the subject of career pathways performance measurement builds on the recent work begun by the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP). CLASP is currently leading a two-year. statedriven effort to identify metrics that characterize high quality career pathways systems and a set of performance metrics. 1 Although the approach we describe below differs from CLASP’s in a number of ways. we want to acknowledge CLASP’s work as a source of inspiration and express our gratitude for the pioneering work it and its partners are doing.,True,GCWTtvQAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://www.careerladdersproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Career_Pathways_System_Measurement.pdf,,,,,https://www.careerladdersproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Career_Pathways_System_Measurement.pdf,0,0,0
