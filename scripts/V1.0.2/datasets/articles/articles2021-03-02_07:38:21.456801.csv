C4 evolution has been seen as a consequence of past atmospheric CO2 decline. such as the abrupt CO2 fall 32–25 million years ago (Mya) 3. 4. 5. 6. This relationship has never been tested rigorously. mainly because of a lack of accurate estimates of divergence times for the different C4 lineages [3]. In this study. we inferred a large phylogenetic tree for the grass family and estimated. through Bayesian molecular dating. the ages of the 17 to 18 independent grass C4 lineages. The first transition from C3 to C4 photosynthesis occurred in the Chloridoideae subfamily. 32.0–25.0 Mya.

1100983,Miscanthus: genetic resources and breeding potential to enhance bioenergy production,2008,Wilfred Vermerris,,,,295-308,Springer. New York. NY,The genus Miscanthus Anderss. comprises about a dozen grass species that are closely related to sugarcane. Two tall species in particular–M. sacchariflorus (Maxim.) Hack and M. sinensis Anderss. and their hybrids–are receiving considerable attention as potential bioenergy crops because of their ability to produce very high yields of biomass. with heights up to 7 m and predicted dry matter yields under optimal conditions as high as 45 Mg ha–1 yr–1. Miscanthus is also attractive because it is perennial. This means the plants translocate minerals to the rhizomes at the end of the growing season. reducing the amount of fertilizer needed to obtain good biomass yields. An additional attractive feature of Miscanthus is that it is adapted to a wide range of climates and soils. a reflection of the wide geographic adaptation of several Miscanthus species in East Asia. the region of origin of this genus.

To orient this line of research we develop a conceptual framework in which the likelihood of a biome shift is a function of (a) exposure to contrasting environments over time. (b) the evolutionary accessibility of relevant adaptations. and (c) changing biotic interactions. We evaluate the literature on biome shifts in plants in relation to a set of hypotheses on the size. connectedness. and absolute age of biomes. as well as on the adaptability of particular lineages and ecological interactions over time. We also critique the phylogenetic inference of past biomes and a “global” model-based approach to biome evolution.

The accuracy of these methods depends on both an adequate underlying model and the appropriate implementation of fossil evidence as calibration points. We explore the effect of these in Poaceae (grasses). a diverse plant lineage with a very limited fossil record. focusing particularly on dating the early divergences in the group. We show that molecular dating based on a data set of plastid markers is strongly dependent on the model assumptions. In particular. an acceleration of evolutionary rates at the base of Poaceae followed by a deceleration in the descendants strongly biases methods that assume an autocorrelation of rates.

With the largest phylogeny yet compiled for grasses. we present an example of a key physiological innovation that promoted high diversification rates. C4 photosynthesis. a complex suite of traits that improves photosynthetic efficiency under conditions of drought. high temperatures. and low atmospheric CO2. has evolved repeatedly in one lineage of grasses and was consistently associated with elevated diversification rates. In most cases there was a significant lag time between the origin of the pathway and subsequent radiations. suggesting that the ‘C4 effect’ is complex and derives from the interplay of the C4 syndrome with other factors. We also identified comparable radiations occurring during the same time period in C3 Pooid grasses. a diverse. cold-adapted grassland lineage that has never evolved C4 photosynthesis. The mid to late Miocene was an especially important period of both C3 and C4 grass diversification. coincident with the global development of extensive. open biomes in both warm and cool climates.

While the LES is most apparent in comparing species with extreme differences in their traits. it has nonetheless been adopted as a general explanation of leaf trait variation at all scales and in all plants.

They are also both signature elements of stress-adapted floras the world over and play fundamental roles in the ecological success of flowering plants.

Feeding them will require a boost in crop productivity using innovative approaches. Current agricultural production is very dependent on large amounts of inputs and water availability is a major limiting factor. In addition. the loss of genetic diversity and the threat of climate change make a change of paradigm in plant breeding and agricultural practices necessary. Average yields in all major crops are only a small fraction of record yields. and drought and soil salinity are the main factors responsible for yield reduction. Therefore there is the need to enhance crop productivity by improving crop adaptation. Here we review the present situation and propose the development of crops tolerant to drought and salt stress for addressing the challenge of dramatically increasing food production in the near future. The success in the development of crops adapted to drought and salt depends on the efficient and combined use of genetic engineering and traditional breeding tools.

Since then. many local cultivars have arisen. These materials are grouped in four cultivar groups: “round.” “semi-long.” “long.” and “listada de Gandía.” We studied the morphological and molecular [amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)] diversity of a collection of 28 Spanish traditional cultivars of eggplant. Four eggplant accessions from different origins were used as controls and three scarlet eggplant (Solanum aethiopicum L.) accessions as outgroups. Morphology and AFLP markers showed that S. melongena and S. aethiopicum are separate taxonomic entities. and that. compared to controls. Spanish eggplants are very variable. indicating that the Iberian Peninsula can be regarded as a secondary center of diversity. Morphological differences were found among cultivar groups in traits other than those used for the grouping although. in some cases. accessions from different cultivar groups shared a similar general morphology. Eggplant cultivar groups also showed some genetic differences. which are revealed in the gene diversity statistics (GST = 0.30). Nonetheless. no individual AFLP markers specific and universal to one cultivar group could be found. “Round” cultivars were genetically more diverse than the other cultivar groups.

1101036,Wild relatives of the eggplant (Solanum melongena L.: Solanaceae): new understanding of species names in a complex group,2013,Sandra Knapp and Maria S Vorontsova and Jaime Prohens,8,PloS one,2,e57039,Public Library of Science,Background The common or brinjal eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) belongs to the Leptostemonum Clade (the “spiny” solanums) of the species-rich genus Solanum (Solanaceae). Unlike most of the genus. the eggplant and its relatives are from the Old World; most eggplant wild relatives are from Africa. An informal system for naming eggplant wild relatives largely based on crossing and other biosystematics data has been in use for approximately a decade. This system recognises several forms of two broadly conceived species. S. incanum L. and S. melongena. Recent morphological and molecular work has shown that species-level differences exist between these entities. and a new species-level nomenclature has been identified as necessary for plant breeders and for the maintenance of accurately named germplasm.   Methodology/Principal Findings We examined herbarium specimens from throughout the wild species ranges as part of a larger revision of the spiny solanums of Africa. Based on these morphological and molecular studies. we delimited species in the group to which the common eggplant belongs and constructed identification keys for the group. We also examined the monophyly of the group considered as the eggplant relatives by previous authors.   Conclusions/Significance We recognise ten species in this group: S. aureitomentosum Bitter. S. campylacanthum A.Rich.. S. cerasiferum Dunal. S. incanum L.. S. insanum L.. S. lichtensteinii Willd.. S. linnaeanum Hepper & P.-M.L.Jaeger. S. melongena L..

This has raised an interest for the development of new crop cultivars with increased CGA content. One of the crops with higher CGA content is eggplant (Solanum melongena). There is a wide diversity for CGA content in cultivated eggplant germplasm. which is influenced by the fruit developmental stage. storage conditions. and environmental factors. Therefore. appropriate experimental designs are required for an efficient breeding. Several strategies are proposed for breeding for high CGA content such as intraspecific variation. selection among accessions. development of hybrids and lines with good agronomic and commercial characteristics. or introgression of the high CGA trait in Ã© lite lines. Some wild relatives. like S. incanum. present higher CGA contents than those of eggplant. Interspecific hybridization can be used to introgress favorable alleles from the wild species into the genetic background of cultivated eggplant. Fruit flesh browning. as a result of CGA oxidation by polyphenol oxidases. could be a side effect of increasing the CGA content in eggplant.

Chlorogenic acid is the polyphenol most present in eggplant. comprising between the 70% and 90% of the total polyphenol content. Introduction of the high chlorogenic acid content of wild relatives. such as S. incanum. into eggplant varieties will be of great interest. A potential side effect of the increased level polyphenols could be a decrease on apparent quality due to browning caused by the polyphenol oxidase enzymes mediated oxidation of polyphenols. We report the development of a new interspecific S. melongena × S. incanum linkage map based on a first backcross generation (BC1) towards the cultivated S. melongena as a tool for introgressing S. incanum alleles involved in the biosynthesis of chlorogenic acid in the genetic background of S. melongena.

From there eggplant spread to other regions. and diversity accumulated in several secondary centers of diversity. We have assessed the diversity and relationships of 52 accessions of eggplant from three geographically distant secondary centers of diversity (China. Spain. and Sri Lanka) using 28 morphological descriptors and 12 highly polymorphic genomic SSRs. A wide variation was found for most morphological traits. and significant differences among the three centers of diversity were detected for 22 of these traits. The PCA analysis showed that eggplants from the three origins were morphologically differentiated. and accessions from each of the three secondary centers of diversity presented a typical combination of morphological characteristics. In this respect. discriminant analysis showed that accessions could be correctly classified to their origin using only six traits. The SSR characterization identified 110 alleles and allowed obtaining a unique genetic fingerprint for each accession. Many alleles were found to be private to each origin. but no universal alleles were found for any of the origins. The PCA analysis showed that the genetic differentiation among origins was less clear than for morphological traits. although the analysis of the population structure shows that accessions mostly group according to the origin. but also provides evidence of migration among the three secondary centers of diversity.

1101050,Breeding vegetables with increased content in bioactive phenolic acids,2015,Prashant Kaushik and Isabel Andújar and Santiago Vilanova and Mariola Plazas and Pietro Gramazio and Francisco Javier Herraiz and Navjot Singh Brar and Jaime Prohens,20,,10,18464-18481,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Vegetables represent a major source of phenolic acids. powerful antioxidants characterized by an organic carboxylic acid function and which present multiple properties beneficial for human health. In consequence. developing new varieties with enhanced content in phenolic acids is an increasingly important breeding objective. Major phenolic acids present in vegetables are derivatives of cinnamic acid and to a lesser extent of benzoic acid. A large diversity in phenolic acids content has been found among cultivars and wild relatives of many vegetable crops. Identification of sources of variation for phenolic acids content can be accomplished by screening germplasm collections. but also through morphological characteristics and origin. as well as by evaluating mutations in key genes. Gene action estimates together with relatively high values for heritability indicate that selection for enhanced phenolic acids content will be efficient. Modern genomics and biotechnological strategies. such as QTL detection. candidate genes approaches and genetic transformation. are powerful tools for identification of genomic regions and genes with a key role in accumulation of phenolic acids in vegetables. However. genetically increasing the content in phenolic acids may also affect other traits important for the success of a variety. We anticipate that the combination of conventional and modern strategies will facilitate the development of a new generation of vegetable varieties with enhanced content in phenolic acids.

NY,Spinach is arguably the #1 or # 2 most nutritious vegetable (broccoli being the other) that is consumed in the United States. It is very versatile since it is commonly used as a salad. a cooked vegetable or as a component of many other cooked meat and vegetable dishes. The recent development of baby leaf spinach coupled with an upswing of nutrition concerns has been responsible for increased consumption of spinach. It is widely stated that dark green leafy vegetables are the most lacking component of the American diet. Spinach is one of the most desirable dark green leafy vegetables because it is high in beta carotene (pro vitamin A) and folate. and is also a good source of vitamin C. calcium. iron phosphorous. sodium and potassium (Ryder. 1979; Nonnicke. 1989; Dicoteau. 2000).

1101053,Toward an evolved concept of landrace,2017,Francesc Casañas and Joan Simó and Joan Casals and Jaime Prohens,8,Frontiers in plant science,,145,Frontiers,The term “landrace” has generally been defined as a cultivated. genetically heterogeneous variety that has evolved in a certain ecogeographical area and is therefore adapted to the edaphic and climatic conditions and to its traditional management and uses. Despite being considered by many to be inalterable. landraces have been and are in a constant state of evolution as a result of natural and artificial selection. Many landraces have disappeared from cultivation but are preserved in gene banks. Using modern selection and breeding technology tools to shape these preserved landraces together with the ones that are still cultivated is a further step in their evolution in order to preserve their agricultural significance. Adapting historical landraces to present agricultural conditions using cutting-edge breeding technology represents a challenging opportunity to use them in a modern sustainable agriculture. as an immediate return on the investment is highly unlikely. Consequently. we propose a more inclusive definition of landraces. namely that they consist of cultivated varieties that have evolved and may continue evolving. using conventional or modern breeding techniques. in traditional or new agricultural environments within a defined ecogeographical area and under the influence of the local human culture. This includes adaptation of landraces to new management systems and the unconscious or conscious selection made by farmers or breeders using available technology. In this respect. a mixed selection system might be established in which farmers and other social agents develop evolved landraces from the variability generated by public …,True,OOYHajIAAAAJ:M_lZXyI38BkC,66,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00145/full,1199760187863975884,/scholar?cites=1199760187863975884,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00145/full,0,0,0

However. interspecific hybridization with wild relatives has been barely used in eggplant breeding programs. As initiation of an introgression breeding program we performed 1424 interspecific hybridizations between six accessions of eggplant from the Occidental and Oriental groups and 19 accessions of 12 wild species from the primary (Solanum incanum and Solanum insanum). secondary (Solanum anguivi.

Phylogenetic studies in the family have also progressed steadily. For this study. a parsimony analysis was carried out using all rbcL sequences currently available for Cyperaceae. including data for two new genera. One of the four subfamilies (Caricoideae) and seven of the 14 tribes (Bisboeckelereae. Cariceae. Cryptangieae. Dulichieae. Eleocharideae. Sclerieae. Trilepideae) are monophyletic.

1101060,A short history of the introduction and spread of Elodea Michx in the British Isles,1984,DA Simpson,15,Watsonia,1,1-9,,In the British Isles during the 19705. there was a sudden and rapid increase of plants having the general characteristics of Elodea Michx. but with longer and narrower leaves than had previously been observed. A recent investigation has shown that three species are present. Elodea canadensis Michx. E. ernstiae St John and E. nuttallii (Planch.) St John. The study has also confirmed the identity of Hydril/a verticil/ala (Lf) Royle in western Ireland. The history of the three Elodea species is reviewed. E. canadensis was first recorded in 1836 and then rapidly increased. becoming widespread and often reaching pest proportions. Its introduction presented a number of problems to 19th century botanists. particularly regarding its origins and identity. From the 18805 it showed a general decline and. although still widespread throughout the British Isles. it rarely occurs in large numbers. E. ernstiae was first seen in 1948. but has not shown any rapid increase or spread. being confined to southern England and one locality in Wales. It has often been confused with E. nutta/lii. E. nutta/lii was first recorded in 1966. It has since increased and spread rapidly. particularly in north-western and south-eastern England but is rare in Wales and Ireland and absent from Scotland. It shows a wide range of morphological variation which has caused many problems of identification. E. nutta/lii has replaced E. canadensis at a number of sites where the latter was well-established.

C4 or Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathways represent a fundamental axis of trait variation in plants. with importance at scales from genome to biome. Knowing the distribution of these pathways among wild species is a crucial first step in understanding the patterns and processes of photosynthetic evolution and its role in ecological processes at large scales (eg changes in the composition of biomes under global change). C4 photosynthesis is most prevalent in the Poaceae (grasses). which account for about half of all C4 species (Sageet al.. 1999a). Research on the evolution and ecology of these plants has undergone a renaissance during the last 7 yr. catalyzed by phylogenetic analyses showing multiple parallel C4 origins (eg Christin et al.. 2007; Vicentini et al.. 2008; GPWG II. 2012). insights into the distribution of C4 species and assembly of the C4 grassland biome (Edwards & Still …,True,IDrrPGgAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C,77,https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.12942,12537328418522338230,/scholar?cites=12537328418522338230,,https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/nph.12942,0,0,0

St John has spread rapidly since its introduction into the British Isles in 1966. A feature of its spread has been its displacement of E. canadensis Michx in places where the latter was well established. One possible reason is that E. nuttallii is able to achieve more rapid stem elongation. as well as produce a greater number of axillary stems over a given period of time. resulting in E. canadensis eventually being shaded out of a locality. Cultivation experiments suggested that stem elongation and axillary stem production was significantly (P< O· OOl) greater in E. nuttallii under nutrient-poor and-rich conditions and a range of light intensities. Stem elongation in E. nuttallii appeared to be most rapid immediately after establishment. while in E. canadensis there was a gradual elongation as time progressed. These characteristics may lead to more rapid formation of a canopy of stems and leaves by E. nuttallii at or near the water surface. a factor which may help to bring about the eventual displacement of E. canadensis in many places.,True,IDrrPGgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,64,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.666.1032&rep=rep1&type=pdf,15678432120715690669,/scholar?cites=15678432120715690669,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.666.1032&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Anatomy is readily visualized. including various planes of section from a single specimen. as clear as in traditional histological sectioning at low magnifications. Thus. digital sectioning of rare or difficult material is possible.

A recent publication by Garnett and Christidis [1] expressed concerns regarding the difficulty that taxonomic changes represent for conservation efforts and proposed the establishment of a system to govern taxonomic changes. Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects. They also assert that the lack of governance of taxonomy damages conservation efforts. harms the credibility of science. and is costly to society. Despite its fairly recent release.

Herein. we contribute to the conversation between taxonomists and conservation biologists aiming to clarify some misunderstandings and issues in the proposition by Garnett and Christidis.

This mite has developed resistance to at least 25 pesticides in China. It first developed resistance to parathion and demeton. As early as 1962. the level of resistance to demeton in T. cinnabarinus reached 62 times. which resulted in control failure of this mite on cotton in most cotton growing areas in China. The genetics of omethoate-resistance and monocrotophos-resistance in T. cinnabarinus is each controlled by an incompletely dominant gene and the development of resistance is therefore rapid. The developmental time and other life table parameters of T. cinnabarinus are altered when the mite becomes pesticide-resistant: life cycle becomes shorter and reproductive rate becomes greater.

We undertook genome sequencing and annotation. gene expression assays. studies of plant cell wall degrading enzymes. and other functional and comparative studies of the Asian longhorned beetle. Anoplophora glabripennis. a globally significant invasive species capable of inflicting severe feeding damage on many important tree species. Complementary studies of genes encoding enzymes involved in digestion of woody plant tissues or detoxification of plant allelochemicals were undertaken with the genomes of 14 additional insects. including the newly sequenced emerald ash borer and bull-headed dung beetle. The Asian longhorned beetle genome encodes a uniquely diverse arsenal of enzymes that can degrade the main polysaccharide networks in plant cell walls. detoxify plant allelochemicals. and otherwise facilitate feeding on woody plants. It has the metabolic plasticity needed to feed on diverse plant species. contributing to its highly invasive nature. Large expansions of chemosensory genes involved in the reception of pheromones and plant kairomones are consistent with the complexity of chemical cues it uses to find host plants and mates. Amplification and functional divergence of genes associated with specialized feeding on plants. including genes originally obtained via horizontal gene transfer from fungi and bacteria. contributed to the addition. expansion. and enhancement of the metabolic repertoire of the Asian longhorned beetle. certain other phytophagous beetles. and to a lesser degree. other phytophagous insects.

We used phylogenomic methods to obtain DNA sequences from 522 protein-coding genes for representatives of all families of weevils and all subfamilies of Curculionidae.

Surprisingly little is known about opsin evolution in beetles. even though they are the most species rich animal group on Earth and exhibit considerable variation in visual system sensitivities. We reveal the patterns of opsin evolution across 62 beetle species and relatives. Our results show that the major insect opsin class (SW) that typically confers sensitivity to “blue” wavelengths was lost~ 300 million years ago. before the origin of modern beetles. We propose that UV and LW opsin gene duplications have restored the potential for trichromacy (three separate channels for colour vision) in beetles up to 12 times and more specifically. duplications within the UV opsin class have likely led to the restoration of “blue” sensitivity up to 10 times.

Recently. these pests have significantly reduced shiitake production in Korea. However. larvae and female adults cannot be identified due to their lack of morphological characteristics. Therefore. farmers and applied entomologists are unable to determine which species is the primary cause of the shiitake damage. In this study. mycophagous flies (colonized larvae) were collected from damaged shiitake farms and subsequently identified by matching identified males with the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences from the larvae.

Indeed. the largest beetle suborder. Polyphaga. mostly includes plant eaters among its approximately 315.000 species. In particular. plants defend themselves with a diversity of specialized toxic chemicals. These may impose selective pressures that drive genomic diversification and speciation in phytophagous beetles. However. evidence of changes in beetle gene repertoires driven by such interactions remains largely anecdotal and without explicit hypothesis testing. We explore the genomic consequences of beetle-plant trophic interactions by performing comparative gene family analyses across 18 species representative of the two most species-rich beetle suborders. We contrast the gene contents of species from the mostly plant-eating suborder Polyphaga with those of the mainly predatory Adephaga. We find gene repertoire evolution to be more dynamic. with significantly more adaptive lineage-specific expansions. in the more speciose Polyphaga. Testing the specific hypothesis of adaptation to plant feeding. we identify families of enzymes putatively involved in beetle-plant interactions that underwent adaptive expansions in Polyphaga. There is notable support for the selection hypothesis on large gene families for glutathione S-transferase and carboxylesterase detoxification enzymes. Our explicit modeling of the evolution of gene repertoires across 18 species identifies putative adaptive lineage-specific gene family expansions that accompany the dietary shift towards plants in beetles.

Transcriptomes of 15 species and anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) sequence captures of 86 species. representing 94 bee fly species and 14 subfamilies. were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of Bombyliidae. We integrated data from transcriptomes across each of the main lineages in our AHE tree to build a data set with more genes (550 loci versus 216 loci) and higher support levels.

With over 1400 species classified in 300 genera. this is the sixth largest among 117 beetle families in Australia. These beetles often attack and kill living forest or orchard trees and develop in construction timber (like the European House borer. introduced to WA). causing serious damage. Virtually all Cerambycidae feed on living or dead plant tissues and play a significant role in all terrestrial environments where plants are found. Larvae often utilise damaged or dead trees for their development. and through feeding on rotten wood form an important element of the saproxylic fauna. speeding energy circulation in these habitats. Many species are listed as quarantine pests because of their destructive role to the timber industry. This second of three volumes on Australian Longhorn Beetles covers the taxonomy of genera of the Cerambycinae. with comments on natural history and morphology. One hundred and forty-two Cerambycinae genera are diagnosed and described. an illustrated key to their identification is provided. and images illustrate representatives of genera and of actual type specimens.

Monommatidae and Zopheridae are examined. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using Hennig86 and based on 37 exemplar genera from each of these families and several possible outgroups coded for 59 morphological features (42 adult and 17 larval). Results of the analyses suggest that the three families form amonophilethic group. which may be divided into two subfamilies. Colydiinae and Zopherinae. andthat the latter may be further divided into six tribes: Latometini (trib. nov.). Usechini. Monommatini. Phellopsini (trib. nov.). Pycnomerini (sens. nov.) and Zopherini (sens. nov.). The genera comprising the Zopherinae (excluding Monommatini) are keyed aout and redescribed. and general remarks are made on the biology of the family. Three new genera are described: Orthocerodes gen. nov.(type species: Sarrotrium australis Blackburn. 1891). Australia; Notorhocerus gen. nov.(type species N. valdivianus sp. nov.).

Many species are aphidophagous. feeding as larvae and adults on aphids. but some species also feed on other hemipterous insects (i.e.. heteropterans. psyllids. whiteflies). beetle and moth larvae. pollen. fungal spores. and even plant tissue. Several species are biological control agents or widespread invasive species (e.g.. Harmonia axyridis (Pallas)). Despite the ecological importance of this tribe. relatively little is known about the phylogenetic relationships within it. The generic concepts within the tribe Coccinellini are unstable and do not reflect a natural classification. being largely based on regional revisions. This impedes the phylogenetic study of important traits of Coccinellidae at a global scale (e.g. the evolution of food preferences and biogeography). We present the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Coccinellini to date. based on three nuclear and one mitochondrial gene sequences of 38 taxa. which represent all major Coccinellini lineages. The phylogenetic reconstruction supports the monophyly of Coccinellini and its sister group relationship to Chilocorini. Within Coccinellini. three major clades were recovered that do not correspond to any previously recognised divisions. questioning the traditional differentiation between Halyziini. Discotomini. Tytthaspidini. and Singhikaliini. Ancestral state reconstructions of food preferences and morphological characters support the idea of aphidophagy being the ancestral state in Coccinellini.

Staphylinidae Latreille. 1802,2000,Alfred F Newton and Margaret K Thayer and James S Ashe and Donald S Chandler,1,American beetles,,272-418,CRC press,S taphylinidae is the largest or second-largest family of beetles. with over 46.200 known species placed in more than 3.200 genera; nearly 400 species are added each year. some from North America. It is a worldwide and ancient group. with a fossil history extending back some 200 million years. The family is abundantly represented in all but the driest parts of North America. and its 523 genera and over 4.100 named species make it the largest beetle family in this region.Though staphylinids exhibit tremendous variation in form (eg. Figs. 1-40.22). the vast majority can be distinguished from other beetles by their combination of short truncate elytra exposing more than half of the rather flexible abdomen. six or occasionally seven visible abdominal sterna. and (with few exceptions) contiguous procoxae. Pselaphinae are exceptional in having more rigid abdomens and often only five visible sterna. but are readily recognizable by their distinctive compact habitus (Figs. 3.22. 11-15.22) and usually distinctly clubbed antennae.

We used phylogenomic methods to obtain DNA sequences from 522 protein-coding genes for representatives of all families of weevils and all subfamilies of Curculionidae. Most of our phylogenomic results had strong statistical support. and the inferred relationships were generally congruent with those reported in previous studies. but with some interesting exceptions.

Detailed morphological study of a new well-preserved Cretaceous Burmese amber fossil revealed strong evidence consistent with its taxonomic placement in the euaesthetine genus Octavius. We thus describe Octavius electrospinosus sp. nov.. the first Cretaceous record of the genus and of the tribe Euaesthetini. Previously. the oldest records of Octavius and Euaesthetini were from the Eocene (Baltic amber) and discovery of O. electrospinosus sp. nov. therefore nearly doubles the minimum lineage age of Octavius. increasing it by ∼50 million years.

1101322,The Weevil Fauna Preserved in Burmese Amber—Snapshot of a Unique. Extinct Lineage (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea),2019,Dave J. Clarke and Ajay Limaye and Duane D McKenna and Rolf G. Oberprieler,11,Diversity,1,1-219,,Only a few weevils have been described from Burmese amber. and although most have been misclassified. they show unusual and specialised characters unknown in extant weevils. In this paper. we present the results of a study of a much larger and more diverse selection of Burmese amber weevils. We prepared all amber blocks to maximise visibility of structures and examined these with high-magnification light microscopy as well as CT scanning (selected specimens). We redescribe most previously described taxa and describe 52 new species in 26 new genera. accompanied by photographs. We compare critical characters of these weevils with those of extant taxa and outline the effects of distortion on their preservation and interpretation. We conclude that only two weevil families are thus far represented in Burmese amber. Nemonychidae and a newly recognised family. Mesophyletidae. which appears closely related to Attelabidae but cannot be accommodated in this family. The geniculate antennae and long rostrum with exodont mandibles of most Mesophyletidae indicate that they were highly specialised phytophages of early angiosperms preserved in the amber. likely ovipositing in flowers or seeds. This weevil fauna appears to represent an extinct mid-Cretaceous ecosystem and fills a critical gap in the fossil record of weevils.

Here we describe Tonantzin new genus. a new monotypic genus. potentially endemic to the mountains of central Mexico. The new genus is diagnosed by a new configuration of characters from the mesofrontal structure (MFS) in addition to other characters. The MFS in Passalidae has been treated either as a composite complex character or a combination of individual characters. Using a broad taxonomic sample within Proculini. we discuss the taxonomic and systematic implications of the MFS for the tribe. We define the MFS type tepetl. Given the importance of the MFS for passalid taxonomy we propose a new delimitation of the structure using boundaries based on internal and external head structures. We argue that the treatment of the MFS as a complex character better captures the nature of this structure but we ultimately find a need to standardize the way in which this structure is described in the taxonomic literature and used in phylogenetic analyses.

1101336,Systematics and biogeography of austral rove beetles (Staphylinidae: Euaesthetinae and Staphylininae),2013,David J Clarke,,,,,,Southern hemisphere rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) are poorly known taxonomically. and comprise many phylogenetically isolated taxa. This thesis presents fundamental systematic work on groups within the subfamilies Staphylininae (genus Creophilus) and Euaesthetinae. In Chapter II. the genus Creophilus is revised and two new species are described. A phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters of this and related genera revealed that genital. chaetotaxic and structural characters each contribute phylogenetic signal. with genital characters producing signal largely congruent with that of external structures. The monophyly of the austral C. erythrocephalus species-group was strongly supported. In Chapter III. a first broadly sampled phylogenetic analysis of subfamily Euaesthetinae did not recover the austral endemic genera as a monophyletic group. but did recover several genera and generic groupings as monophyletic. This chapter presented the first comprehensive morphological dataset for Euaesthetinae. reviewed the austral endemic genera. described larvae for many of them. and provided identification keys to both adults and larvae. In Chapter IV. the New Zealand euaesthetine genus Agnosthaetus is revised; 28 new species are described and taxonomic. ecological. and distribution data are synthesized for all known species. The genus is distributed throughout New Zealand. and its distribution patterns and phylogeny are the subject of Chapter V.

This includes 10‐fold or greater shortfalls in the numbers of Delta and Epsilon GSTs and CYP4 P450s. members of which clades have been recurrently associated with insecticide resistance in other species.

This hypothesis has been invoked both for prediction and for post hoc explanation of the results of hundreds of studies. Although it successfully predicts outcomes in some cases. it fails to such an extent that it cannot any longer be considered useful as a predictive tool. As information from studies has accumulated. many attempts have been made to save CNB. but these have been largely unsuccessful and have managed only to limit its utility. The failure of CNB is rooted in assumptions that are now known to be incorrect and it is time to abandon CNB because continued use of the hypothesis is now hindering understanding of plant–consumer interactions.

CYP6B1 from the specialist Papilio polyxenes. feeding on furanocoumarin-containing plants. and CYP6B8 from the generalist Helicoverpa zea. feeding on hundreds of host plant species. are compared structurally and functionally. Molecular modeling indicates that CYP6B8 has more flexible overall folding. a more elastic catalytic pocket. and one more substrate access channel than CYP6B1. Baculovirus-mediated expression of the CYP6B8 and CYP6B1 proteins demonstrates that CYP6B8 metabolizes six biosynthetically diverse plant allelochemicals (xanthotoxin …,True,RZePWDQAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,267,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/9/2939.short,13870940618278061981,/scholar?cites=13870940618278061981,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/101/9/2939.full.pdf,0,0,0

Pathogens and other environmental stresses. including pesticides. have been linked to CCD. but a causal relationship has not yet been demonstrated. Because the gut acts as a primary interface between the honey bee and its environment as a site of entry for pathogens and toxins. we used whole-genome microarrays to compare gene expression between guts of bees from CCD colonies originating on both the east and west coasts of the United States and guts of bees from healthy colonies sampled before the emergence of CCD. Considerable variation in gene expression was associated with the geographical origin of bees. but a consensus list of 65 transcripts was identified as potential markers for CCD status.

McHugh and Michael F. Whiting,29,Systematic Entomology,2,173-187,Wiley Online Library, Phylogenetic relationships of Erotylidae (pleasing fungus beetles) were inferred based on DNA sequence data. Relationships of clades within Erotylidae were examined. as was the relationship of the entire family to Languriidae (lizard beetles). 18S and 28S ribosomal DNA were sequenced for sixty‐one taxa representing major erotylid lineages and outgroups. Phylogenetic analyses under varying parameter settings using standard parsimony and likelihood techniques were performed. These data indicate a paraphyletic Erotylidae and Languriidae. Encaustinae (including Coptengis). Megalodacninae and Erotylinae are supported as monophyletic. whereas Dacninae and Tritominae are paraphyletic. Taxonomic and biological implications are discussed.

Robertson,24,Current Biology,,2435-2439,Cell Press,Ant-nest beetles (Paussus) are the quintessential Trojan horses of the insect world. They hack the complex communication system of ants. allowing them to blend into the ant society and be treated as royalty. all the while preying upon the ants and the ants’ brood and duping the ants into rearing their young [1. 2. 3]. Here we present results of the first molecular-based phylogeny of ant-nest beetles. which reveals that this symbiosis has produced one of the most stunning examples of rapid adaptive radiation documented to date. The most recent ancestor of a Paussus clade endemic to Madagascar is only 2.6 million years old. This species gave rise to a remarkably phenotypically diverse clade of 86 extant species with a net diversification interval of 0.38–0.81 million years. a rate of radiation faster than classic textbook examples of large. recent. rapid radiations such as Anolis lizards on Caribbean islands. cichlids of …,True,epA--yoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,35,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214011439,9766784462877300957,/scholar?cites=9766784462877300957,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214011439,0,0,0

Females employ a wide range of egg-laying techniques. largely corresponding to their ecological niche. including dropping or flicking eggs to the forest floor. gluing eggs to plant substrate. skewering eggs through leaves. ovipositing directly into the soil. or even producing a complex ootheca. Phasmids are the only insects with highly species-specific egg morphology across the entire order. with specific egg forms that correspond to oviposition technique. We investigate the temporal. biogeographic and phylogenetic pattern of evolution of egg-laying strategies in Phasmatodea. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that the ancestral oviposition strategy for female stick and leaf insects is to remain in the foliage and drop or flick eggs to the ground. a strategy that maintains their masquerade. Other major key innovations in the evolution of Phasmatodea include the (1) hardening of the egg capsule in Euphasmatodea; (2) the repeated evolution of capitulate eggs (which induce ant-mediated dispersal. or myrmecochory); (3) adapting to a ground or bark dwelling microhabitat with a corresponding shift in adult and egg phenotype and egg deposition directly into the soil; and (4) adhesion of eggs in a clade of Necrosciinae that led to subsequent diversification in oviposition modes and egg types.

Previous research explored recombination in the honeybee. a eusocial hymenopteran with an exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rate. A comparable study in a non-social member of the Hymenoptera that would disentangle the impact of sociality from Hymenoptera-specific features such as haplodiploidy on the evolution of the high genome-wide recombination rate in social Hymenoptera is missing. Utilizing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between two Nasonia parasitoid wasp genomes. we developed a SNP genotyping microarray to infer a high-density linkage map for Nasonia. The map comprises 1.255 markers with an average distance of 0.3 cM. The mapped markers enabled us to arrange 265 scaffolds of the Nasonia genome assembly 1.0 on the linkage map. representing 63.6% of the assembled N. vitripennis genome. We estimated a genome-wide recombination rate of 1.4–1.5 cM/Mb for Nasonia. which is less than one tenth of the rate reported for the honeybee. The local recombination rate in Nasonia is positively correlated with the distance to the center of the linkage groups. GC content. and the proportion of simple repeats. In contrast to the honeybee genome. gene density in the parasitoid wasp genome is positively associated with the recombination rate; regions of low recombination are characterized by fewer genes with larger introns and by a greater distance between genes.

In weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea). iridescence is created by the most complex of these mechanisms. the three-dimensional photonic crystal. These self-assembling crystals take the form of triply periodic networks with single diamond or single gyroid symmetries and have been the subject of many descriptive studies based on individual species (often on a single specimen). To determine how these extraordinary nanostructures have evolved. we conduct the first comparative study of photonic crystals and setal nanostructure across Curculionoidea.

Nanoscale periodicity within these crystals ampliies the relectance of certain wavelengths of light. producing the bright colours that we recognize as metallic or iridescent. Photonic crystals of biological origin occur throughout the animal kingdom. from nudibranchs to butterlies [2]; however. some of nature/s most sophisticated photonic engineers are found among the beetles (Coleoptera).

Aethina tumida is a damaging nest invader of European honey bee colonies in the USA and Australia (Ellis and Munn. 2005) while C. luteus is presumed to be innocuous to bee colonies in Germany (Neumann and Ritter. 2004).

We performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Coleoptera inferred from three genes and nearly 1900 species. representing more than 80% of the world9s recognized beetle families. We defined basal relationships in the Polyphaga supergroup. which contains over 300.000 species. and established five families as the earliest branching lineages. By dating the phylogeny. we found that the success of beetles is explained neither by exceptional net diversification rates nor by a predominant role of herbivory and the Cretaceous rise of angiosperms.

The lack of internal characters and soft-tissue preservation in many arthropod fossils. however. impedes comprehensive phylogenetic analyses and species descriptions according to taxonomic standards for Recent organisms. We found well-preserved three-dimensional anatomy in mineralized arthropods from Paleogene fissure fillings and demonstrate the value of these fossils by utilizing digitally reconstructed anatomical structure of a hister beetle. The new anatomical data facilitate a refinement of the species diagnosis and allowed us to reject a previous hypothesis of close phylogenetic relationship to an extant congeneric species.

In the current study. we investigated the phylogeographic structure of two zopherid beetle species. Phloeodes diabolicus and P. plicatus. where their ranges overlap in California's Transverse Ranges. Although P. diabolicus and P. plicatus share similar habitats with largely overlapping distributions. the results of this study revealed different evolutionary histories for each species since divergence from their most recent common ancestor. In general. P. plicatus had higher genetic diversity. and more among population isolation than P. diabolicus. The mismatch distributions indicated that one major difference between the two species was the timing of population expansion. This result was consistent with genetic patterns revealed by the Φst values and genetic diversity. Lastly. there were no parallel genetic breaks at similar geographic barriers between the species.

A large impediment faced by A. glabripennis as it feeds on woody tissue is lignin. a highly recalcitrant biopolymer that reduces access to sugars and other nutrients locked in cellulose and hemicellulose.

While lignin degrading mechanisms have been well characterized in pure cultures of white rot basidiomycetes. little is known about such processes in microbial communities associated with wood-feeding insects. The goals of this study were to develop a taxonomic and functional profile of a gut community derived from an invasive population of larval A. glabripennis collected from infested host trees and to identify genes that could be relevant for the digestion of woody tissue and nutrient acquisition. To accomplish this goal. we taxonomically and functionally characterized the A. glabripennis midgut microbiota through amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing and conducted a large-scale comparison with the metagenomes from a variety of other herbivore-associated communities.

Anoplophora glabripennis,2012,Erin D Scully and Kelli Hoover and John Carlson and Ming Tien and Scott M Geib,7,PloS one,4,e32990,Public Library of Science,Wood is a highly intractable food source. yet many insects successfully colonize and thrive in this challenging niche. Overcoming the lignin barrier of wood is a key challenge in nutrient acquisition. but full depolymerization of intact lignin polymers has only been conclusively demonstrated in fungi and is not known to occur by enzymes produced by insects or bacteria. Previous research validated that lignocellulose and hemicellulose degradation occur within the gut of the wood boring insect. Anoplophora glabripennis (Asian longhorned beetle). and that a fungal species. Fusarium solani (ATCC MYA 4552). is consistently associated with the larval stage. While the nature of this relationship is unresolved. we sought to assess this fungal isolate's ability to degrade lignocellulose and cell wall polysaccharides and to extract nutrients from woody tissue. This gut-derived fungal isolate was inoculated onto a wood-based substrate and shotgun proteomics using Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) was employed to identify 400 expressed proteins. Through this approach. we detected proteins responsible for plant cell wall polysaccharide degradation. including proteins belonging to 28 glycosyl hydrolase families and several cutinases. esterases. lipases. pectate lyases. and polysaccharide deacetylases. Proteinases with broad substrate specificities and ureases were observed. indicating that this isolate has the capability to digest plant cell wall proteins and recycle nitrogenous waste under periods of nutrient limitation.

Although switchgrass-greenbug (Schizaphis graminum; GB) interactions have been studied at the whole plant level. little information is available on plant defense responses at the molecular level. The global transcriptomic response of switchgrass cv Summer to GB was monitored by RNA-Seq in infested and control (uninfested) plants harvested at 5. 10. and 15 days after infestation (DAI). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in infested plants were analyzed relative to control uninfested plants at each time point. DEGs in GB-infested plants induced by 5-DAI included an upregulation of reactive burst oxidases and several cell wall receptors. Expression changes in genes linked to redox metabolism. cell wall structure. and hormone biosynthesis were also observed by 5-DAI. At 10-DAI. network analysis indicated a massive upregulation of defense-associated genes. including NAC. WRKY. and MYB classes of transcription factors and potential ancillary signaling molecules such as leucine aminopeptidases. Molecular evidence for loss of chloroplastic functions was also detected at this time point. Supporting these molecular changes. chlorophyll content was significantly decreased. and ROS levels were elevated in infested plants 10-DAI.

Using the translation elongation factor 1-alpha region for culture-independent phylogenetic and operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-based analyses. only two OTUs were detected. suggesting that genetic variance at this locus was low among A. glabripennis-associated isolates. To better survey the genetic variation of F. solani associated with A. glabripennis. and establish its phylogenetic relationship with other members of the F. solani species complex. single spore isolates were created from different populations and multi-locus phylogenetic analysis was performed using a combination of the translation elongation factor alpha-1. internal transcribed spacer. and large subunit rDNA regions.

Previous phylogenetic work has required labor-intensive marker development coupled with single-locus polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing on clade-by-clade and locus-by-locus basis. Here. we present a new. cost-efficient. and rapid approach to obtaining data from hundreds of loci for potentially hundreds of individuals for deep and shallow phylogenetic studies. Specifically. we designed probes for target enrichment of >500 loci in highly conserved anchor regions of vertebrate genomes (flanked by less conserved regions) from five model species and tested enrichment efficiency in nonmodel species up to 508 million years divergent from the nearest model.

We use 4-taxon simulations to study the effects of ambiguous data (i.e.. missing characters or gaps) in maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian frameworks. By introducing ambiguous data in a way that removes confounding factors. we provide the first clear understanding of 1 mechanism by which ambiguous data can mislead phylogenetic analyses. We find that in both ML and Bayesian frameworks. among-site rate variation can interact with ambiguous data to produce misleading estimates of topology and branch lengths.

Model misspecification can strongly bias bipartition posterior probability estimates. These biases were most pronounced when rate heterogeneity was ignored. The type of bias seen at a particular bipartition appeared to be strongly influenced by the lengths of the branches surrounding that bipartition. In the Felsenstein zone. posterior probability estimates of bipartitions were biased when the assumed model was underparameterized but were unbiased when the assumed model was overparameterized. For the inverse Felsenstein zone. however. both underparameterization and overparameterization led to biased bipartition posterior probabilities. although the bias caused by overparameterization was less pronounced and …,True,wNmwYS4AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,321,https://www.jstor.org/stable/4135411,14412984833303915932,/scholar?cites=14412984833303915932,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.539.5060&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The levels of divergence implied by such branch lengths are unreasonable for studies using biological data and are known to be false for studies using simulated data. We conducted additional Bayesian analyses and studied approximate-posterior surfaces to investigate the causes underlying these large errors. We manipulated the starting parameter values of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses. the moves used by the MCMC analyses. and the prior-probability distribution on branch lengths. We demonstrate that inaccurate branch-length estimates result from either 1) poor mixing of MCMC chains or 2) posterior distributions with excessive weight at long tree lengths.

Divergence occurs when different traits undergo reproductive character displacement across populations within a contact zone. Here. I tested this hypothesis by assessing patterns of acoustic signal divergence in two‐ and three‐species assemblages of chorus frogs (Pseudacris). focusing in particular on P. feriarum and P. nigrita. In addition. I tested one criterion for reinforcement. by examining the evolution of female P. feriarum preferences in the contact zone.

Snake venoms are particularly useful in the latter regard as they consist primarily of a moderate number of proteins and peptides that have been found to belong to just a handful of protein families. As these proteins and peptides are produced in dedicated glands. transcriptome sequencing has proven to be an effective approach to identifying the expressed toxin genes.

Here. we develop a new statistical framework that can be used to both test a priori hypotheses and estimate phylogeographic history of a gene (and the statistical confidence in that history) in the absence of such hypotheses. The statistical approach concentrates on estimation of geographic locations of the ancestors of a set of sampled organisms.

Recently. alternative targeted sequence capture techniques have provided molecular systematics a powerful tool for resolving relationships across the Tree of Life. One of these approaches. Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE). is designed to recover hundreds of unique orthologous loci from across the genome. for resolving both shallow and deep-scale evolutionary relationships within non-model systems. Herein we present a modification of the AHE approach that expands its use for application in spiders. with a particular emphasis on the infraorder Mygalomorphae. Our aim was to design a set of probes that effectively capture loci informative at a diversity of phylogenetic timescales. Following identification of putative arthropod-wide loci. we utilized homologous transcriptome sequences from 17 species across all spiders to identify exon boundaries. Conserved regions with variable flanking regions were then sought across the tick genome. three published araneomorph spider genomes. and raw genomic reads of two mygalomorph taxa.

Because the magnitude and direction of selection can vary across a life cycle. an accurate understanding of the ubiquity of reinforcement requires fitness to be estimated across the life cycle. but the literature is surprisingly depauperate of such studies. We present fitness estimates of laboratory‐raised hybrids between the chorus frogs Pseudacris feriarum and Pseudacris nigrita—two species that have undergone reproductive character displacement where they come into secondary contact.

Syrphidae (flower flies or hoverflies) are an ideal candidate for anchored hybrid enrichment-based phylogenetics. especially since recent molecular phylogenies of the syrphids using only a few markers have resulted in highly unresolved topologies. Over 6200 syrphids are currently known and uncovering their phylogeny will help us to understand how these species have diversified. providing insight into an array of ecological processes. from the development of adult mimicry. the origin of adult migration. to pollination patterns and the evolution of larval resource utilization. We present the first use of anchored hybrid enrichment in insect phylogenetics on a dataset containing 30 flower fly species from across all four subfamilies and 11 tribes out of 15. To produce a phylogenetic hypothesis. 559 loci were sampled to produce a final dataset containing 217.702 sites.

Despite much attention. previous attempts to elucidate relationships using molecular and morphological characters have been incongruent. In this study we present the first phylogenomic analysis using anchored hybrid enrichment for 172 taxa to represent the order (plus three out-group taxa). which is the largest dataset for the order to date (219 loci. 315.288 bp. average locus length of 1011 bp). Concatenation analysis establishes a robust tree with 97 % of nodes at 100 % bootstrap support. Species tree analysis was highly congruent with the concatenation analysis with only two major differences: monophyly of Cobitoidei and placement of Danionidae. Most major clades obtained in prior molecular studies were validated as monophyletic. and we provide robust resolution for the relationships among these clades for the first time.

Recently. alternative targeted sequence capture techniques have provided molecular systematics a powerful tool for resolving relationships across the Tree of Life. One of these approaches. Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE). is designed to recover hundreds of unique orthologous loci from across the genome. for resolving both shallow and deep-scale evolutionary relationships within non-model systems. Herein we present a modification of the AHE approach that expands its use for application in spiders. with a particular emphasis on the infraorder Mygalomorphae. Our aim was to design a set of probes that effectively capture loci informative at a diversity of phylogenetic timescales. Following identification of putative arthropod-wide loci. we utilized homologous transcriptome sequences from 17 species across all spiders to identify exon boundaries. Conserved regions with variable flanking regions were then sought across the tick genome. three published araneomorph spider genomes. and raw genomic reads of two mygalomorph taxa. Following development of the 585 target loci in the Spider Probe Kit. we applied AHE across three taxonomic depths to evaluate performance: deep-level spider family relationships (33 taxa. 327 loci); family and generic relationships within the mygalomorph family Euctenizidae (25 taxa. 403 loci); and species relationships in the North American tarantula genus …,True,2xR_OmsAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,101,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0769-y,5743943807273193488,/scholar?cites=5743943807273193488,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0769-y,0,0,0

Because the magnitude and direction of selection can vary across a life cycle. an accurate understanding of the ubiquity of reinforcement requires fitness to be estimated across the life cycle. but the literature is surprisingly depauperate of such studies. We present fitness estimates of laboratory‐raised hybrids between the chorus frogs Pseudacris feriarum and Pseudacris nigrita—two species that have undergone reproductive character displacement where they come into secondary contact. By studying viability. mating success. and fertility across the life cycle. we find strong support for reinforcement as the force driving displacement in this system.

Once a probe kit is developed. anchored hybrid enrichment is superior to traditional PCR-based Sanger sequencing in terms of both the amount of genomic data that can be recovered and effective cost. Due to their incredibly diverse nature. importance as pollinators. and historical instability with regard to subfamilial and tribal classification. Syrphidae (flower flies or hoverflies) are an ideal candidate for anchored hybrid enrichment-based phylogenetics. especially since recent molecular phylogenies of the syrphids using only a few markers have resulted in highly unresolved topologies. Over 6200 syrphids are currently known and uncovering their phylogeny will help us to understand how these species have diversified. providing insight into an array of ecological processes. from the development of adult mimicry. the origin of adult migration. to pollination patterns and the evolution of larval resource utilization.

Current methods for estimating best-fit partitioning schemes. however. are only computationally feasible with datasets of fewer than 100 loci. This is a problem because datasets with thousands of loci are increasingly common in phylogenetics. We develop two novel methods for estimating best-fit partitioning schemes on large phylogenomic datasets: strict and relaxed hierarchical clustering. These methods use information from the underlying data to cluster together similar subsets of sites in an alignment. and build on clustering approaches that have been proposed elsewhere. We compare the performance of our methods to each other. and to existing methods for selecting partitioning schemes. We demonstrate that while strict hierarchical clustering has the best computational efficiency on very large datasets. relaxed hierarchical clustering provides scalable efficiency and returns dramatically better partitioning schemes as assessed by common criteria such as AICc and BIC scores. These two methods provide the best current approaches to inferring partitioning schemes for very large datasets. We provide free open-source implementations of the methods in the PartitionFinder software.

To understand the diversification and key evolutionary transitions of Hymenoptera. most notably from phytophagy to parasitoidism and predation (and vice versa) and from solitary to eusocial life. we inferred the phylogeny and divergence times of all major lineages of Hymenoptera by analyzing 3.256 protein-coding genes in 173 insect species.

1101631,Visualizing differences in phylogenetic information content of alignments and distinction of three classes of long-branch effects,2007,Johann W Wägele and Christoph Mayer,7,BMC Evolutionary Biology,1,147,BioMed Central Ltd,Published molecular phylogenies are usually based on data whose quality has not been explored prior to tree inference. This leads to errors because trees obtained with conventional methods suppress conflicting evidence. and because support values may be high even if there is no distinct phylogenetic signal. Tools that allow an a priori examination of data quality are rarely applied. Using data from published molecular analyses on the phylogeny of crustaceans it is shown that tree topologies and popular support values do not show existing differences in data quality. To visualize variations in signal distinctness. we use network analyses based on split decomposition and split support spectra. Both methods show the same differences in data quality and the same clade-supporting patterns. Both methods are useful to discover long-branch effects. We discern three classes of long branch effects. Class I effects consist of attraction of terminal taxa caused by symplesiomorphies. which results in a false monophyly of paraphyletic groups. Addition of carefully selected taxa can fix this effect. Class II effects are caused by drastic signal erosion. Long branches affected by this phenomenon usually slip down the tree to form false clades that in reality are polyphyletic. To recover the correct phylogeny. more conservative genes must be used. Class III effects consist of attraction due to accumulated chance similarities or convergent character states. This sort of noise can be reduced by selecting less variable portions of the data set. avoiding biases. and adding slower genes.

Mixture models and partitioning are commonly used to account for this variation. and partitioning is the most popular approach. Most current partitioning methods require some a priori partitioning scheme to be defined. typically guided by known structural features of the sequences. such as gene boundaries or codon positions. Recent evidence suggests that these a priori boundaries often fail to adequately account for variation in rates and patterns of evolution among sites. Furthermore. new phylogenomic datasets such as those assembled from ultra-conserved elements lack obvious structural features on which to define a priori partitioning schemes. The upshot is that. for many phylogenetic datasets. partitioned models of molecular evolution may be inadequate. thus limiting the accuracy of downstream phylogenetic analyses. We present a new algorithm that automatically selects a partitioning scheme via the iterative division of the alignment into subsets of similar sites based on their rates of evolution. We compare this method to existing approaches using a wide range of empirical datasets. and show that it consistently leads to large increases in the fit of partitioned models of molecular evolution when measured using AICc and BIC scores. In doing so. we demonstrate that some related approaches to solving this problem may have been associated with a small but important bias.

For various genomes. the densities of short TR types were shown to differ strongly among different taxa and genomic regions. In this study we analysed the TR characteristics in the genomes of Daphnia pulex and 11 other eukaryotic species. Characteristics of TRs in different genomic regions and among different strands are compared in details for D. pulex and the two model insects Apis mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster. Profound differences in TR characteristics were found among all 12 genomes compared in this study. In D. pulex. the genomic density of TRs was low compared to the arthropod species D. melanogaster and A. mellifera. For these three species. very few common features in repeat type usage. density distribution. and length characteristics were observed in the genomes and in different genomic regions.

We simulated data of different alignment lengths under two different 11-taxon trees and a broad range of different branch length conditions. The data were analyzed with the true model parameters as well as with estimated and incorrect assumptions about among-site rate variation. If length differences between connected branches strongly increase. tree inference with the correct likelihood model assumptions can fail. We found that incorporating invariant sites together with  distributed site rates in the tree reconstruction (+I) increases the robustness of maximum likelihood in comparison with models using only . The results show that for some topologies and branch lengths the reconstruction success of maximum likelihood under the correct model is still low for alignments with a length of 100.000 base positions.

Major problems for our understanding of the evolutionary history of Apoidea have been the difficulty to trace the phylogenetic origin and to reliably estimate the geological age of bees.

In insects. RNAi serves a number of functions. including regulation of endogenous genes. anti-viral defense. and defense against transposable elements. Despite being well studied in model organisms. such as Drosophila. the distribution of core RNAi pathway genes and their evolution in insects is not well understood. Here we present the most comprehensive overview of the distribution and diversity of core RNAi pathway genes across 100 insect species. encompassing all currently recognized insect orders.

However. different phylogenetic trees often contain conflicting results and contradict significant background data. Not knowing how reliable traditional knowledge is. a crucial question concerns the quality of newly produced molecular data. The information content of DNA alignments is rarely discussed. as quality statements are mostly restricted to the statistical support of clades. Here we present a case study of a recently published mollusk phylogeny that contains surprising groupings. based on five genes and 108 species. and we apply new or rarely used tools for the analysis of the information content of alignments and for the filtering of noise (masking of random-like alignment regions. split decomposition. phylogenetic networks. quartet mapping). The data are very fragmentary and contain contaminations. We show that that signal-like patterns in the data set are conflicting and partly not distinct and that the reported strong support for a ""rather surprising result"" (monoplacophorans and chitons form a monophylum Serialia) does not exist at the level of primary homologies. Split-decomposition. quartet mapping and neighbornet analyses reveal conflicting nucleotide patterns and lack of distinct phylogenetic signal for the deeper phylogeny of mollusks.

We sequenced one tenebrionid beetle and 12 carabid beetles ranging in size from 3.7 to 9.7 mm in length that have been stored in various museums for 4 to 84 years.

1101682,The genome diversity and karyotype evolution of mammals,2011,Alexander S Graphodatsky and Vladimir A Trifonov and Roscoe Stanyon,4,,1,1-16,BioMed Central,The past decade has witnessed an explosion of genome sequencing and mapping in evolutionary diverse species. While full genome sequencing of mammals is rapidly progressing. the ability to assemble and align orthologous whole chromosome regions from more than a few species is still not possible. The intense focus on building of comparative maps for companion (dog and cat). laboratory (mice and rat) and agricultural (cattle. pig. and horse) animals has traditionally been used as a means to understand the underlying basis of disease-related or economically important phenotypes. However. these maps also provide an unprecedented opportunity to use multispecies analysis as a tool for inferring karyotype evolution. Comparative chromosome painting and related techniques are now considered to be the most powerful approaches in comparative genome studies. Homologies can be identified with high accuracy using molecularly defined DNA probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on chromosomes of different species. Chromosome painting data are now available for members of nearly all mammalian orders. In most orders. there are species with rates of chromosome evolution that can be considered as 'default' rates. The number of rearrangements that have become fixed in evolutionary history seems comparatively low. bearing in mind the 180 million years of the mammalian radiation. Comparative chromosome maps record the history of karyotype changes that have occurred during evolution.

Rates increase exponentially with advancing maternal age for trisomies 21. 18 and 13. and for the XXX and XXY syndromes. but in the autosomal trisomies this rise appears to be followed by a levelling off at the upper end of the age range. A significant inverse relationship with maternal age is found for 45.X cases. It is postulated that these various patterns are the result of the interaction of three principal factors: a maternal age effect acting particularly on first meiotic nondisjunction: a higher spontaneous abortion rate with advancing maternal age for aneuploid as compared to euploid conceptions; and an increased probability of spontaneous abortion before the time of amniocentesis for conceptions with more extensive chromosome …,True,RLlUm9sAAAAJ:I858iXPj1OkC,481,https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pd.1970040704,15549530795847131812,/scholar?cites=15549530795847131812,,,0,0,0

Genome-wide mapping of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is important for understanding both chromosomal architecture and specific chromosomal regions at DSBs. We developed a method for precise genome-wide mapping of blunt-ended DSBs in human chromosomes. and observed non-random fragmentation and DSB hot spots. These hot spots are scattered along chromosomes and delimit protected 50–250 kb DNA domains. We found that about 30% of the domains (denoted forum domains) possess coordinately expressed genes and that PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 specifically bind DNA sequences at the forum domain termini. Thus. our data suggest a novel type of gene regulation: a coordinated transcription or silencing of gene clusters delimited by DSB hot spots as well as PARP1 and HNRNPa2B1 binding sites.,True,4nxccVUAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,39,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003429,3741134878382827559,/scholar?cites=3741134878382827559,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003429,0,0,0

The sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus. Linnaeus. 1758; ARUT) is a diploid 120-chromosomal sturgeon distributed in Eurasian rivers from Danube to Enisey. Despite a high commercial value and a rapid population decline in the wild. many genomic characteristics of sterlet (as well as many other sturgeon species) have not been studied. Cell lines from different tissues of 12 sterlet specimens from Siberian populations were established following an optimized protocol. Conventional cytogenetic studies supplemented with molecular cytogenetic investigations on obtained fibroblast cell lines allowed a detailed description of sterlet karyotype and a precise localization of 18S/28S and 5S ribosomal clusters. Localization of sturgeon specific HindIII repetitive elements revealed an increased concentration in the pericentromeric region of the acrocentric ARUT14. while the total sterlet repetitive DNA fraction (C0t30) produced bright signals on subtelomeric segments of small chromosomal elements. Chromosome and region specific probes ARUT1p. 5. 6. 7. 8 as well as 14 anonymous small sized chromosomes (probes A-N) generated by microdissection were applied in chromosome painting experiments.

The Siberian roe deer occupies a vast area of Asia and is considerably less studied than the European roe deer. Modern systematics of the Siberian roe deer remain controversial with 4 morphological subspecies. Roe deer fossilized bones are quite abundant in Denisova cave (Altai Mountains. South Siberia). where dozens of both extant and extinct mammalian species from modern Holocene to Middle Pleistocene have been retrieved.   Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed a 629 bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region from ancient bones of 10 Holocene and four Pleistocene Siberian roe deer from Denisova cave as well as 37 modern specimen belonging to populations from Altai. Tian Shan (Kyrgyzstan). Yakutia. Novosibirsk region and the Russian Far East. Genealogical reconstructions indicated that most Holocene haplotypes were probably ancestral for modern roe deer populations of Western Siberia and Tian Shan. One of the Pleistocene haplotypes was possibly ancestral for modern Yakutian populations. and two extinct Pleistocene haplotypes were close to modern roe deer from Tian Shan and Yakutia. Most modern geographical populations (except for West Siberian Plains) are heterogeneous and there is some tentative evidence for structure.

The sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus. Linnaeus. 1758; ARUT) is a diploid 120-chromosomal sturgeon distributed in Eurasian rivers from Danube to Enisey. Despite a high commercial value and a rapid population decline in the wild. many genomic characteristics of sterlet (as well as many other sturgeon species) have not been studied. Cell lines from different tissues of 12 sterlet specimens from Siberian populations were established following an optimized protocol. Conventional cytogenetic studies supplemented with molecular cytogenetic investigations on obtained fibroblast cell lines allowed a detailed description of sterlet karyotype and a precise localization of 18S/28S and 5S ribosomal clusters. Localization of sturgeon specific HindIII repetitive elements revealed an increased concentration in the pericentromeric region of the acrocentric ARUT14. while the total sterlet repetitive DNA fraction (C0t30) produced bright signals on subtelomeric segments of small chromosomal elements.

The order has a basal position within Actinopteri (ray-finned fish minus polypterids) and is characterized by many specific morphological and genomic features. including high diploid chromosome numbers. various levels of ploidy between species. unclear sex determination. and propensity to interspecific hybridization. Recent advances in molecular genetics. genomics. and comparative cytogenetics produced novel data on different aspects of acipenseriform biology. including improved phylogenetic reconstructions and better understanding of genome structure.

This problem can be solved combining SC immunostaining with FISH of chromosome-specific sequences. However. this procedure is expensive. time-consuming and applicable only to a very limited number of species. In this paper we show how a combination of SC immunostaining and DAPI staining can allow identification of all chromosome arms in surface-spreads of the SC of the common shrew (Sorex araneus L.).

Acipenserids represent a convenient model group for investigation of the consequences of WGD as their representatives underwent additional WGD events in different lineages resulting in ploidy level variation between species. and these processes are still ongoing. Earlier. we obtained a set of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) chromosome-specific libraries by microdissection and revealed that they painted two or four pairs of whole sterlet chromosomes. as well as additional chromosomal regions. depending on rediploidization status and chromosomal rearrangements after genome duplication. In this study. we employed next generation sequencing to estimate the content of libraries derived from different paralogous chromosomes of sterlet. For this purpose. we aligned the obtained reads to the spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) reference genome to reveal syntenic regions between these two species having diverged 360 Mya. We also showed that the approach is effective for synteny prediction at various evolutionary distances and allows one to clearly distinguish paralogous chromosomes in polyploid genomes. We postulated that after the acipenserid-specific WGD sterlet karyotype underwent multiple interchromosomal rearrangements. but different chromosomes were involved in this process unequally.

Previous assignment of the WARS gene to the long arm of human Chromosome (Chr) 14 has been made by somatic cell hybrid techniques (Denney and Craig 1976; Shimizu et al. 1976). Francke and co-workers (1977) mapped it on 14q21-q32. We describe here the localization of the WARS gene to the bovine and human chromosomes with specific cDNA probes (Frolova et al. 1991) for in situ hybridization. Detailed protocols for the in situ hybridization. chromosome staining. and silver grain distribution analysis have been given previously (Graphodatsky et al. 1992). Standard nomenclatures of the human and cattle chromosomes were used (ISCN 1985; ISCNDA 1989).Our results confirm the previously reported assignment of the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase gene to Chr 14 (Denney and Craig 1976; Shimizu et al. 1976; Francke et al. 1977). Twenty-four percent of all grains (202 grains from 104 total metaphases) were mapped on Chr 14 (•= 185.0; P< 0.001). Sixty-three percent of the grains over Chr 14 were localized to the 14q23-q31 region; 33% to the 14q24 band.

The sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus. Linnaeus. 1758; ARUT) is a diploid 120-chromosomal sturgeon distributed in Eurasian rivers from Danube to Enisey. Despite a high commercial value and a rapid population decline in the wild. many genomic characteristics of sterlet (as well as many other sturgeon species) have not been studied. Cell lines from different tissues of 12 sterlet specimens from Siberian populations were established following an optimized protocol. Conventional cytogenetic studies supplemented with molecular cytogenetic investigations on obtained fibroblast cell lines allowed a detailed description of sterlet karyotype and a precise localization of 18S/28S and 5S ribosomal clusters.

Cavia porcellus (Hystricomorpha. Rodentia). is an important laboratory species and a model for a number of human diseases. Nevertheless. genomic tools for this species are lacking; even its karyotype is poorly characterized. The guinea pig belongs to Hystricomorpha. a widespread and important group of rodents; so far the chromosomes of guinea pigs have not been compared with that of other hystricomorph species or with any other mammals. We generated full sets of chromosome-specific painting probes for the guinea pig by flow sorting and microdissection. and for the first time. mapped the chromosomal homologies between guinea pig and human by reciprocal chromosome painting. Our data demonstrate that the guinea pig karyotype has undergone extensive rearrangements: 78 synteny-conserved human autosomal segments were delimited in the guinea pig genome. The high rate of genome evolution in the guinea pig may explain why the HSA7/16 and HSA16/19 associations presumed ancestral for eutherians and the three syntenic associations (HSA1/10. 3/19. and 9/11) considered ancestral for rodents were not found in C. porcellus. The comparative chromosome map presented here is a starting point for further development of physical and genetic maps of the guinea pig as well as an aid for genome assembly assignment to specific chromosomes. Furthermore. the comparative mapping will allow a transfer of gene map data from other species.

Owing to the use of the Zoo-FISH method. the nomenclature of chromosomes was refined and nonhomologous Robertsonian translocations indistinguishable by G-staining were identified for Ellobius tancrei. which is a species with a wide chromosome variation of the Robertsonian type. The electron-microscopic analysis of synaptonemal complexes in F1 hybrids of forms with 2n = 50 and 2n = 48 revealed the formation of a closed SC-pentavalent composed of three metacentrics with monobrachial homology and two acrocentrics.

However. whether NMRs have more efficient DNA repair have not been directly tested. Here we compared base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) systems in extracts from NMR and mouse fibroblasts after UVC irradiation. Transcript levels of the key repair enzymes demonstrated in most cases higher inducibility in the mouse vs the NMR cells. Ratios of repair enzymes activities in the extracts somewhat varied depending on post-irradiation time. NMR cell extracts were 2–3-fold more efficient at removing the bulky lesions. 1.5–3-fold more efficient at removing uracil. and about 1.4-fold more efficient at cleaving the AP-site than the mouse cells. while DNA polymerase activities being as a whole higher in the mouse demonstrate different …,True,Rb7L85AAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,23,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6046242/,14858019406057318551,/scholar?cites=14858019406057318551,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6046242/,0,0,0

Until recently. MCB probes have only been available for human and some murine chromosomes. Generation of MCB probes for chromosomes of other species. useful and required in many cytogenetics research fields. was limited by technical difficulties. MCB probes are established by chromosome microdissection followed by whole genomic DNA amplification. However. unambiguous identification of the target chromosome is required for MCB-probe establishment. Previously proposed protocols suggested G-banding staining or preliminary FISH with whole chromosome paints (WCP) as methods to identify the chromosome of interest. Here we present a complete workflow for MCB probe generation for those cases and species where chromosome morphology is too challenging to recognize target chromosomes by conventional methods and where WCP probes are not available. The workflow was successfully applied for murine chromosomes that are difficult to identify unambiguously. Additionally. we showed that glass-needle based microdissection enables establishment of a whole set of WCP paints by microdissection of individual chromosomes of a single metaphase The present method can be applied for generation of whole or region-specific DNA probes for species. where karyotyping of G-banded chromosomes is challenging due to similar chromosome morphology and/or chromosome banding patterns.,True,Rb7L85AAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,16,https://molecularcytogenetics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1755-8166-6-6,11107812510796242942,/scholar?cites=11107812510796242942,,https://molecularcytogenetics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1755-8166-6-6,0,0,0

Bs accumulate through non-Mendelian inheritance and become widespread in populations. Despite the presence of multiple genes. most Bs lack specific phenotypic effects. although their influence on host genome epigenetic status and gene expression are recorded. Previously. using sequencing of isolated Bs of ruminants and rodents. we demonstrated that Bs originate as segmental duplications of specific genomic regions. and subsequently experience pseudogenization and repeat accumulation. Here. we used a similar approach to characterize Bs of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes L.) and the Chinese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides procyonoides Gray). We confirm the previous findings of the KIT gene on Bs of both species. but demostrate an independent origin of Bs in these species. with two reused regions. Comparison of gene ensembles in Bs of canids. ruminants. and rodents once again indicates enrichment with cell-cycle genes. development-related genes. and genes functioning in the neuron synapse.

The sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus. Linnaeus. 1758; ARUT) is a diploid 120-chromosomal sturgeon distributed in Eurasian rivers from Danube to Enisey. Despite a high commercial value and a rapid population decline in the wild. many genomic characteristics of sterlet (as well as many other sturgeon species) have not been studied. Cell lines from different tissues of 12 sterlet specimens from Siberian populations were established following an optimized protocol. Conventional cytogenetic studies supplemented with molecular cytogenetic investigations on obtained fibroblast cell lines allowed a detailed description of sterlet karyotype and a precise localization of 18S/28S and 5S ribosomal clusters. Localization of sturgeon specific HindIII repetitive elements revealed an increased concentration in the pericentromeric region of the acrocentric ARUT14. while the total sterlet repetitive DNA fraction (C0t30) produced bright signals on subtelomeric segments of small chromosomal elements. Chromosome and region specific probes ARUT1p. 5. 6. 7. 8 as well as 14 anonymous small sized chromosomes (probes A-N) generated by microdissection were applied in chromosome painting experiments.

A notable exception is the cetartiodactyl X chromosome. which varies widely in morphology and G-banding pattern between species. It is hypothesized that this sex chromosome has undergone multiple rearrangements that changed the centromere position and the order of syntenic segments over the last 80 million years of Cetartiodactyla speciation. To investigate its evolution we have selected 26 evolutionarily conserved bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from the cattle CHORI-240 library evenly distributed along the cattle X chromosome. High-resolution BAC maps of the X chromosome on a representative range of cetartiodactyl species from different branches: pig (Suidae). alpaca (Camelidae). gray whale (Cetacea). hippopotamus (Hippopotamidae).

Bs accumulate through non-Mendelian inheritance and become widespread in populations. Despite the presence of multiple genes. most Bs lack specific phenotypic effects. although their influence on host genome epigenetic status and gene expression are recorded. Previously. using sequencing of isolated Bs of ruminants and rodents. we demonstrated that Bs originate as segmental duplications of specific genomic regions. and subsequently experience pseudogenization and repeat accumulation. Here. we used a similar approach to characterize Bs of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes L.) and the Chinese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides procyonoides Gray). We confirm the previous findings of the KIT gene on Bs of both species. but demostrate an independent origin of Bs in these species. with two reused regions. Comparison of gene ensembles in Bs of canids. ruminants. and rodents once again indicates enrichment with cell-cycle genes. development-related genes. and genes functioning in the neuron synapse.

Acipenserids represent a convenient model group for investigation of the consequences of WGD as their representatives underwent additional WGD events in different lineages resulting in ploidy level variation between species. and these processes are still ongoing. Earlier. we obtained a set of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) chromosome-specific libraries by microdissection and revealed that they painted two or four pairs of whole sterlet chromosomes. as well as additional chromosomal regions. depending on rediploidization status and chromosomal rearrangements after genome duplication. In this study. we employed next generation sequencing to estimate the content of libraries derived from different paralogous chromosomes of sterlet. For this purpose. we aligned the obtained reads to the spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) reference genome to reveal syntenic regions between these two species having diverged 360 Mya. We also showed that the approach is effective for synteny prediction at various evolutionary distances and allows one to clearly distinguish paralogous chromosomes in polyploid genomes. We postulated that after the acipenserid-specific WGD sterlet karyotype underwent multiple interchromosomal rearrangements. but different chromosomes were involved in this process unequally.

The difficulty in identification of individual chromosomes represents an unresolved problem of this method as the body of the chromosome is stained uniformly and does not have banding pattern beyond C-bands. Here. we present the method that we called CDAG for sequential heterochromatin staining after differential GTG-banding. The method uses G-banding followed by heat denaturation in the presence of formamide with consecutive fluorochrome staining.

Chromosome painting in Pinnipedia and comparison with non-pinniped carnivore karyotypes provide strong support for refined structure of ACK with 2n = 38. Constructed comparative chromosome maps show that pinniped karyotype evolution was characterized by few tandem fusions. seemingly absent inversions and slow rate of genome rearrangements (less then one rearrangement per 10 million years).

The sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus. Linnaeus. 1758; ARUT) is a diploid 120-chromosomal sturgeon distributed in Eurasian rivers from Danube to Enisey. Despite a high commercial value and a rapid population decline in the wild. many genomic characteristics of sterlet (as well as many other sturgeon species) have not been studied. Cell lines from different tissues of 12 sterlet specimens from Siberian populations were established following an optimized protocol. Conventional cytogenetic studies supplemented with molecular cytogenetic investigations on obtained fibroblast cell lines allowed a detailed description of sterlet karyotype and a precise localization of 18S/28S and 5S ribosomal clusters. Localization of sturgeon specific HindIII repetitive elements revealed an increased concentration in the pericentromeric region of the acrocentric ARUT14. while the total sterlet repetitive DNA fraction (C0t30) produced bright signals on subtelomeric segments of small chromosomal elements.

In mammalian genomes. NORs are located on autosomes. which are often situated on short arms of acrocentric chromosomes and more rarely in telomeric. pericentromeric. or interstitial regions. In this work. we report the unique case of active NORs located on gonоsomes of a eutherian mammal. the Javan mouse-deer (Tragulus javanicus). We have investigated the position of NORs by FISH experiments with ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences (18S. 5.8 S. and 28S) and show the presence of a single NOR site on the X and Y chromosomes. The NOR is localized interstitially on the p-arm of the X chromosome in close proximity with prominent C-positive heterochromatin blocks and in the pericentromeric area of mostly heterochromatic Y. The NOR sites are active on both the X and Y chromosomes in the studied individual and surrounded by GC enriched heterochromatin. We hypothesize that the surrounding heterochromatin might have played a role in the transfer of NORs from autosomes to sex chromosomes during the karyotype evolution of the Javan mouse-deer.

While full genome sequencing of mammals is rapidly progressing. the ability to assemble and align orthologous whole chromosome regions from more than a few species is still not possible. The intense focus on building of comparative maps for companion (dog and cat). laboratory (mice and rat) and agricultural (cattle. pig. and horse) animals has traditionally been used as a means to understand the underlying basis of disease-related or economically important phenotypes. However. these maps also provide an unprecedented opportunity to use multispecies analysis as a tool for inferring karyotype evolution. Comparative chromosome painting and related techniques are now considered to be the most powerful approaches in comparative genome studies. Homologies can be identified with high accuracy using molecularly defined DNA probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on chromosomes of different species.

Only the human and chimpanzee Y chromosomes have been well characterized at the sequence level. This is primarily due to the presumed low overall gene content and highly repetitive nature of the Y chromosome and the ensuing difficulties using a shotgun sequence approach for assembly. Here we used direct cDNA selection to isolate and evaluate the extent of novel Y chromosome gene acquisition in the genome of the domestic cat. a species from a different mammalian superorder than human. chimpanzee. and mouse (currently being sequenced). We discovered four novel Y chromosome genes that do not have functional copies in the finished human male-specific region of the Y or on other mammalian Y chromosomes explored thus far. Two genes are derived from putative autosomal progenitors. and the other two have X chromosome homologs from different evolutionary strata. All four genes were shown to be multicopy and expressed predominantly or exclusively in testes. suggesting that their duplication and specialization for testis function were selected for because they enhance spermatogenesis. Two of these genes have testis-expressed. Y-borne copies in the dog genome as well. The absence of the four newly described genes on other characterized mammalian Y chromosomes demonstrates the gene novelty on this chromosome between mammalian orders. suggesting it harbors many lineage-specific genes that may …,True,wlVhfrYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,80,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020043,9388085948819479492,/scholar?cites=9388085948819479492,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020043,0,0,0

The sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus. Linnaeus. 1758; ARUT) is a diploid 120-chromosomal sturgeon distributed in Eurasian rivers from Danube to Enisey. Despite a high commercial value and a rapid population decline in the wild. many genomic characteristics of sterlet (as well as many other sturgeon species) have not been studied.

Variations in the X chromosome structure of four bovid species nilgai bull (Boselaphus tragocamelus). saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis). gaur (Bos gaurus). and Kirk’s Dikdik (Madoqua kirkii) were further analyzed using 26 cattle BAC-clones. We found the duplication on the X in saola. We show main rearrangements leading to the formation of four types of bovid X: Bovinae type with derived cattle subtype formed by centromere reposition and Antilopinae type with Caprini subtype formed by inversion in XSB1.

These C-positive bands may greatly vary by location. size. and nucleotide composition. CBG-banding is the most commonly used method to detect structural heterochromatin in animals. The difficulty in identification of individual chromosomes represents an unresolved problem of this method as the body of the chromosome is stained uniformly and does not have banding pattern beyond C-bands. Here. we present the method that we called CDAG for sequential heterochromatin staining after differential GTG-banding. The method uses G-banding followed by heat denaturation in the presence of formamide with consecutive fluorochrome staining.

One such factor could be rDNA amplification and changes in rRNA expression and maturation.Aim of the study: The aim of the present study was to investigate rRNA levels in patients with heteromorphism of the p-arms of acrocentric chromosomes bearing nucleolus organizer regions compared to a healthy control group.Material and methods: Frequencies of p-arms enlargements in patients with ID and in healthy people were analyzed by G-banding screening. rRNA gene copy numbers on affected acrocentric chromosomes in peripheral blood lymphocytes were evaluated in ID patients and healthy bearers using FISH. and in immortalized lymphocytes of one patient–using FISH and real time PCR. Simultaneously. levels of 18S. 28S and 5. 8S rRNA in both groups by means of qRT-PCR were investigated.Results: No difference in acrocentric chromosome heteromorphism frequency in patients versus the healthy group were found. However. we found an amplification of rDNA. a significant elevation in 28S and 5.8 S rRNA expression and changes in the 28S/18S rRNA ratio in ID patients compared to healthy controls. At the same time. FISH appeared to be not reliable enough for copy number evaluation. but RT-PCR showed rDNA copy changes in heteromorphic cells compared to normal.Conclusion: Our findings indicate a loss of the correct regulation of rDNA activity and processing after amplification.

However chromosome painting information from two pinniped families (Odobenidae and Otariidae) is noticeably missing. We report on the construction of the comparative chromosome map for species from each of the three pinniped families: the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus.

Chromosome painting in Pinnipedia and comparison with non-pinniped carnivore karyotypes provide strong support for refined structure of ACK with 2n = 38.

The exact causes of pathologies in children with clinical manifestations are often unknown and vary greatly in the reported cases: uniparental disomy. de novo rearrangements. changes in methylation patterns and gene expression. including ribosomal genes.Aim of the study: Molecular-cytogenetic investigation of a clinical case of intellectual disability.Material and methods: GTG-banding. Ag-NOR staining. fluorescent in situ hybridization. PCR. real-time PCR.Results: We describe a family case of a translocation rob (13; 14) and elevated rRNA expression in the proband with developmental delay and in his phenotypically normal mother. We show the loss of the p-arms of original chromosomes and the absence of NORs on the derived chromosome. The whole-chromosome uniparental disomy is excluded.Conclusion: The translocated chromosome in the proband was most likely inherited from the mother and did not come about de novo with normal chromosomes 13 and 14 being obtained from the father.

Lasiopodomys mandarinus. is one of the most intriguing species among mammals with non-XX/XY sex chromosome system. It combines polymorphism in diploid chromosome numbers. variation in the morphology of autosomes. heteromorphism of X chromosomes. and several sex chromosome systems the origin of which remains unexplained. Here we elucidate the sex determination system in Lasiopodomys mandarinus vinogradovi using extensive karyotyping. crossbreeding experiments. molecular cytogenetic methods. and single chromosome DNA sequencing. Among 205 karyotyped voles. one male and three female combinations of sex chromosomes were revealed. The chromosome segregation pattern and karyomorph-related reproductive performances suggested an aberrant sex determination with almost half of the females carrying neo-X/neo-Y combination. The comparative chromosome painting strongly supported this proposition and revealed the mandarin vole sex chromosome systems originated due to at least two de novo autosomal translocations onto the ancestral X chromosome. The polymorphism in autosome 2 was not related to sex chromosome variability and was proved to result from pericentric inversions. Sequencing of microdissection derived of sex chromosomes allowed the determination of the coordinates for syntenic regions but did not reveal any Y-specific sequences.

It is the main cause of inheritable mental retardation. Progression of the disorder is caused by CGG repeat expansion in 5'UTR of fmr1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene. Normal allele contains≤ 54 repeats. Allele containing 55-200 repeats induce fragile X-associated disorders: fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and fragile-X associated primary ovarian insufficiency. Allele containing≥ 200 repeats induce fragile X syndrome. Absence of FMRP protein is the main reason for the syndrome progression. FMRP is RNA-binding protein responsible for neuronal differentiation. In case of increasing CGG triplets number the expression of fmr1 gene is repressed. Results of CGG expansion are DNA methylation. histone methylation and deacetylation. Repression transcription factors bind such chromatin and lead to disorder progression.

This mutation leads to dramatic changes in FMRP expression at both the mRNA and protein levels.

They often originate from duplications and translocations of host genomic regions or result from hybridization. In most species. little is known about their DNA content. Here we perform high-throughput sequencing and analysis of B chromosomes of roe deer and brocket deer. the only representatives of Cetartiodactyla known to have B chromosomes. In this study we developed an approach to identify genomic regions present on chromosomes by high-throughput sequencing of DNA generated from flow-sorted chromosomes using degenerate-oligonucleotide-primed PCR. Application of this method on small cattle autosomes revealed a previously described KIT gene region translocation associated with colour sidedness. Implementing this approach to B chromosomes from two cervid species. Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) and grey brocket deer (Mazama gouazoubira). revealed dramatically different genetic content: roe deer B chromosomes consisted of two duplicated genomic regions (a total of 1.42-1.98 Mbp) involving three genes. while grey brocket deer B chromosomes contained 26 duplicated regions (a total of 8.28-9.31 Mbp) with 34 complete and 21 partial genes. including KIT and RET protooncogenes. previously found on supernumerary chromosomes in canids. Sequence variation analysis of roe deer B chromosomes revealed a high frequency of mutations and increased heterozygosity due to either amplification within B chromosomes or divergence between different Bs.

Bs accumulate through non-Mendelian inheritance and become widespread in populations. Despite the presence of multiple genes. most Bs lack specific phenotypic effects. although their influence on host genome epigenetic status and gene expression are recorded. Previously. using sequencing of isolated Bs of ruminants and rodents. we demonstrated that Bs originate as segmental duplications of specific genomic regions. and subsequently experience pseudogenization and repeat accumulation. Here. we used a similar approach to characterize Bs of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes L.) and the Chinese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides procyonoides Gray). We confirm the previous findings of the KIT gene on Bs of both species. but demostrate an independent origin of Bs in these species. with two reused regions. Comparison of gene ensembles in Bs of canids. ruminants. and rodents once again indicates enrichment with cell-cycle genes. development-related genes. and genes functioning in the neuron synapse.

First. based on the bioinformatic analysis of recent transcriptomic and genomic resources. we experimentally characterized the IgL genes in the chondrostean fish. Acipenser ruthenus (sterlet). We show that this species has three loci encoding IgL kappa-like chains with a translocon-type gene organization and a single VJC cluster. encoding homogeneous lambda-like light chain. In addition. sterlet possesses sigma-like VL and J-CL genes. which are transcribed separately and both encode protein products with cleavable leader peptides. The Acipenseriformes IgL dataset was extended by the sequences mined in the databases of species belonging to other non-teleost lineages of ray-finned fish: Holostei and Polypteriformes. Inclusion of these new data into phylogenetic analysis showed a clear subdivision of IgL chains into five groups. The isotype described previously as the teleostean IgL lambda turned out to be a kappa and lambda chain paralog that emerged before the radiation of ray-finned fish. We designate this isotype as lambda-2. The phylogeny also showed that sigma-2 IgL chains initially regarded as specific for cartilaginous fish are present in holosteans. polypterids. and even in turtles.

The Siberian roe deer occupies a vast area of Asia and is considerably less studied than the European roe deer. Modern systematics of the Siberian roe deer remain controversial with 4 morphological subspecies. Roe deer fossilized bones are quite abundant in Denisova cave (Altai Mountains. South Siberia). where dozens of both extant and extinct mammalian species from modern Holocene to Middle Pleistocene have been retrieved.   Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed a 629 bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region from ancient bones of 10 Holocene and four Pleistocene Siberian roe deer from Denisova cave as well as 37 modern specimen belonging to populations from Altai. Tian Shan (Kyrgyzstan). Yakutia. Novosibirsk region and the Russian Far East. Genealogical reconstructions indicated that most Holocene haplotypes were probably ancestral for modern roe deer populations of Western Siberia and Tian Shan. One of the Pleistocene haplotypes was possibly ancestral for modern Yakutian populations. and two extinct Pleistocene haplotypes were close to modern roe deer from Tian Shan and Yakutia. Most modern geographical populations (except for West Siberian Plains) are heterogeneous and there is some tentative evidence for structure. However. we did not find any distinct phylogenetic signal characterizing particular subspecies in either modern or ancient samples.

Bs accumulate through non-Mendelian inheritance and become widespread in populations. Despite the presence of multiple genes. most Bs lack specific phenotypic effects. although their influence on host genome epigenetic status and gene expression are recorded. Previously. using sequencing of isolated Bs of ruminants and rodents. we demonstrated that Bs originate as segmental duplications of specific genomic regions. and subsequently experience pseudogenization and repeat accumulation. Here. we used a similar approach to characterize Bs of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes L.) and the Chinese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides procyonoides Gray). We confirm the previous findings of the KIT gene on Bs of both species. but demostrate an independent origin of Bs in these species. with two reused regions. Comparison of gene ensembles in Bs of canids. ruminants. and rodents once again indicates enrichment with cell-cycle genes. development-related genes. and genes functioning in the neuron synapse. The presence of B-chromosomal copies of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and tissue differentiation may indicate importance of these genes for B chromosome establishment.

Acipenserids represent a convenient model group for investigation of the consequences of WGD as their representatives underwent additional WGD events in different lineages resulting in ploidy level variation between species. and these processes are still ongoing. Earlier. we obtained a set of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) chromosome-specific libraries by microdissection and revealed that they painted two or four pairs of whole sterlet chromosomes. as well as additional chromosomal regions. depending on rediploidization status and chromosomal rearrangements after genome duplication. In this study. we employed next generation sequencing to estimate the content of libraries derived from different paralogous chromosomes of sterlet. For this purpose. we aligned the obtained reads to the spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) reference genome to reveal syntenic regions between these two species having diverged 360 Mya. We also showed that the approach is effective for synteny prediction at various evolutionary distances and allows one to clearly distinguish paralogous chromosomes in polyploid genomes. We postulated that after the acipenserid-specific WGD sterlet karyotype underwent multiple interchromosomal rearrangements. but different chromosomes were involved in this process unequally.

Relaxed clock analyses support the long-fuse model of diversification and highlight the importance of including multiple fossil calibrations that are spread across the tree.

However. another source of phylogenetic “noise” is often neglected: the idiosyncratic sorting of gene-tree lineages into descendant taxa from character-state polymorphisms retained across successive nodes in a species tree. Here we introduce a term (hemiplasy) that formalizes a category of outcomes that can emerge from this evolutionary lineage-sorting phenomenon. and we make a case for why a wider recognition of hemiplasy (and attempts to ameliorate its complications) can play an important role in phylogenetics.The word homoplasy. meaning shaped (-plasy) in the same (homo-) way. refers to any trait correspondence or similarity not due to common ancestry.

In an attempt to shed light on the dynamics of mammalian genome evolution. we analyzed the distribution of syntenic blocks. evolutionary breakpoint regions. and evolutionary breakpoints taken from public databases available for seven eutherian species (mouse. rat. cattle. dog. pig. cat. and horse) and the chicken. and examined these for correspondence with human fragile sites and tandem repeats. Our results confirm previous investigations that showed the presence of chromosomal regions in the human genome that have been repeatedly used as illustrated by a high breakpoint accumulation in certain chromosomes and chromosomal bands. We show. however. that there is a striking correspondence between fragile site location. the positions of evolutionary breakpoints. and the distribution of tandem repeats throughout the human genome. which similarly reflect a non-uniform pattern of occurrence. These observations provide further evidence that certain chromosomal regions in the human genome have been repeatedly used in the evolutionary process. As a consequence. the genome is a composite of fragile regions prone to reorganization that have been conserved in different lineages. and genomic tracts that do not exhibit the same levels of evolutionary plasticity.,True,LLaJvSEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,143,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2006-7-12-r115,3258240865887683059,/scholar?cites=3258240865887683059,,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2006-7-12-r115,0,0,0

It has a dynamic evolutionary history characterized by the rise. fall and replacement of subfamilies. Most data concerning LINE-1 biology and evolution are derived from the human and mouse genomes and are often assumed to hold for all placentals.   Methodology To examine LINE-1 relationships. sequences from the 3′ region of the reverse transcriptase from 21 species (representing 13 orders across Afrotheria. Xenarthra. Supraprimates and Laurasiatheria) were obtained from whole genome sequence assemblies. or by PCR with degenerate primers. These sequences were aligned and analysed.   Principal Findings Our analysis reflects accepted placental relationships suggesting mostly lineage-specific LINE-1 families. The data provide clear support for several clades including Glires. Supraprimates. Laurasiatheria. Boreoeutheria. Xenarthra and Afrotheria. Within the afrotherian LINE-1 (AfroLINE) clade. our tree supports Paenungulata. Afroinsectivora and Afroinsectiphillia. Xenarthran LINE-1 (XenaLINE) falls sister to AfroLINE. providing some support for the Atlantogenata (Xenarthra+Afrotheria) hypothesis.   Significance LINEs and SINEs make up approximately half of all placental genomes. so understanding their dynamics is an essential aspect of comparative genomics. Importantly. a tree of LINE-1 offers a different view of the root. as long edges (branches) such as that to marsupials are shortened and/or broken up.

In placental mammals non-coding XIST RNA triggers silencing of one X (Xi) and recruits a characteristic suite of epigenetic modifications. including the histone mark H3K27me3. In marsupials. where XIST is missing. H3K27me3 association seems to have different degrees of stability. depending on cell-types and species. However. the complete suite of histone marks associated with the Xi and their stability throughout cell cycle remain a mystery. as does the evolution of an ancient mammal XCI system. Our extensive immunofluorescence analysis (using antibodies against specific histone modifications) in nuclei of mammals distantly related to human and mouse. revealed a general absence from the mammalian Xi territory of transcription machinery and histone modifications associated with active chromatin. Specific repressive modifications associated with XCI in human and mouse were also observed in elephant (a distantly related placental mammal). as was accumulation of XIST RNA. However. in two marsupial species the Xi either lacked these modifications (H4K20me1). or they were restricted to specific windows of the cell cycle (H3K27me3. H3K9me2). Surprisingly. the marsupial Xi was stably enriched for modifications associated with constitutive heterochromatin in all eukaryotes (H4K20me3. H3K9me3).

However chromosome painting information from two pinniped families (Odobenidae and Otariidae) is noticeably missing. We report on the construction of the comparative chromosome map for species from each of the three pinniped families: the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus. Odobenidae–monotypic family). near threatened Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus. Otariidae) and the endemic Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica. Phocidae) using combination of human. domestic dog and stone marten whole-chromosome painting probes. The earliest karyological studies of Pinnipedia showed that pinnipeds were characterized by a pronounced karyological conservatism that is confirmed here with species from Phocidae. Otariidae and Odobenidae sharing same low number of conserved human autosomal segments (32). Chromosome painting in Pinnipedia and comparison with non-pinniped carnivore karyotypes provide strong support for refined structure of ACK with 2n = 38. Constructed comparative chromosome maps show that pinniped karyotype evolution was characterized by few tandem fusions. seemingly absent inversions and slow rate of genome rearrangements (less then one rearrangement per 10 million years). Integrative comparative analyses with published chromosome painting of Phoca vitulina revealed common cytogenetic signature for Phoca/Pusa branch and supports Phocidae and Otaroidea (Otariidae/Odobenidae) as sister groups.

Human chromosome 13 has been previously shown to be conserved as a single syntenic element in the Ancestral Primate Karyotype; in this context. in order to study and verify the conservation of primate chromosomes homologous to human chromosome 13. we mapped a selected set of BAC probes in three platyrrhine species. characterised by a high level of rearrangements. using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Our mapping data on Saguinus oedipus. Callithrix argentata and Alouatta belzebul provide insight into synteny of human chromosome 13 evolution in a comparative perspective among primate species. showing rearrangements across taxa. Furthermore. in a wider perspective. we have revised previous cytogenomic literature data on chromosome 13 evolution in eutherian mammals. showing a complex origin of the eutherian mammal ancestral karyotype which has still not been completely clarified. Moreover. we analysed biomedical aspects (the OMIM and Mitelman databases) regarding human chromosome 13. showing that this autosome is characterised by a certain level of plasticity that has been implicated in many human cancers and diseases.

We found that the lineage leading to the ruminant ancestor after the split from other cetartiodactyls. was characterized by mostly intrachromosomal changes while the lineage leading to the pecoran ancestor (including all livestock ruminants) included multiple interchromosomal changes. We observed that the liver cell putative enhancers in the ruminant evolutionary breakpoint regions are highly enriched for DNA sequences under selective constraint acting on lineage-specific transposable elements (TEs) and a set of 25 specific transcription factor (TF) binding motifs associated with recently active TEs. Coupled with gene expression data. we found that genes near ruminant breakpoint regions exhibit more divergent expression profiles among species. particularly in cattle. which is consistent with the phylogenetic origin of these breakpoint regions. Notably. this divergence was significantly greater in genes with enhancers that contain at least one of the 25 specific TF binding motifs and located near bovidae-to-cattle lineage breakpoint regions.

It is a result of CGG repeat expansion in the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of the FMR1 gene. This gene encodes the FMRP protein that is involved in neuronal development. Repeat expansion leads to heterochromatinization of the promoter. gene silencing. and the subsequent absence of FMRP. To date. there is no specific therapy for the syndrome. All treatments in clinic practice provide symptomatic therapy. The development of drug therapy for Fragile X syndrome treatment is connected with the search for inhibitors of enzymes that are responsible for heterochromatinization. Here. we report a weak transcriptional activity of the FMR1 gene and the absence of FMRP protein after Fragile X syndrome cell lines treatment with two FDA approved inhibitors of histone deacetylases. romidepsin and vorinostat.

The bovid X chromosome is also remarkably variable. with several morphological types in the family. Here we built a detailed chromosome map of musk ox (Ovibos moschatus). a relic species originating from Pleistocene megafauna. with dromedary and human probes using chromosome painting. We trace chromosomal rearrangements during Bovidae evolution by comparing species already studied by chromosome painting. The musk ox karyotype differs from the ancestral pecoran karyotype by six fusions. one fission. and three inversions. We discuss changes in pecoran ancestral karyotype in the light of new painting data. Variations in the X chromosome structure of four bovid species nilgai bull (Boselaphus tragocamelus). saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis). gaur (Bos gaurus). and Kirk’s Dikdik (Madoqua kirkii) were further analyzed using 26 cattle BAC-clones. We found the duplication on the X in saola.

One such factor could be rDNA amplification and changes in rRNA expression and maturation.Aim of the study: The aim of the present study was to investigate rRNA levels in patients with heteromorphism of the p-arms of acrocentric chromosomes bearing nucleolus organizer regions compared to a healthy control group.Material and methods: Frequencies of p-arms enlargements in patients with ID and in healthy people were analyzed by G-banding screening. rRNA gene copy numbers on affected acrocentric chromosomes in peripheral blood lymphocytes were evaluated in ID patients and healthy bearers using FISH. and in immortalized lymphocytes of one patient–using FISH and real time PCR. Simultaneously. levels of 18S. 28S and 5. 8S rRNA in both groups by means of qRT-PCR were investigated.Results: No difference in acrocentric chromosome heteromorphism frequency in patients versus the healthy group were found.

Alleles containing 55–200 repeats induce fragile X-associated disorders: fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and fragile-X associated primary ovarian insufficiency. Alleles containing ≤ 200 repeats induce fragile X syndrome. The absence of FMRP protein is the main reason for the progression of the syndrome.

Mechanisms of ribosome stabilization have been studied in detail for initiation and elongation of eukaryotic translation. but almost nothing is known about stabilization of eukaryotic termination ribosomal complexes. Here. we present one of the mechanisms of fine-tuning of the translation termination process in eukaryotes. We show that certain deacylated tRNAs. remaining in the E site of the ribosome at the end of the elongation cycle. increase the stability of the termination and posttermination complexes. Moreover. only the part of eRF1 recognizing the stop codon is stabilized in the A site of the ribosome. and the stabilization is not dependent on the hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA.

The middle (M) domain of the class 1 factor eRF1 contains the strictly conserved GGQ motif and is involved in hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA ester bond in the peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosome subunit. Heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy was used to map the interaction interface of the M domain of human eRF1 with eukaryotic ribosomes.

Understanding this complex process is important for treatment of many human disorders caused by nonsense mutations in important genes. Here. we present a new method for the analysis of translation termination rate in cell-free systems. CTELS (for C-terminally extended luciferase-based system). This approach was based on a continuously measured luciferase activity during in vitro translation reaction of two reporter mRNA. one of which encodes a C-terminally extended luciferase. This extension occupies a ribosomal polypeptide tunnel and lets the completely synthesized enzyme be active before translation termination occurs. ie. when it is still on the ribosome. In contrast. luciferase molecule without the extension emits light only after its release. Comparing the translation dynamics of these two reporters allows visualization of a delay corresponding to the translation termination event. We demonstrated applicability of this approach for investigating the effects of cis-and trans-acting components. including small molecule inhibitors and read-through inducing sequences. on the translation termination rate. With CTELS. we systematically assessed negative effects of decreased 3′ UTR length. specifically on termination. We also showed that blasticidin S implements its inhibitory effect on eukaryotic translation system. mostly by affecting elongation. and that an excess of eRF1 termination factor (both the wild-type and a non-catalytic AGQ mutant) can interfere with elongation.

For genome-wide analysis of these changes. we propose the use of NotI clone microarrays and genomic subtraction. because NotI recognition sites are closely associated with CpG islands and genes. We show here that the CODE (Cloning Of DEleted sequences) genomic subtraction procedure can be adapted to NotI flanking sequences and to CpG islands. Because the sequence complexity of this procedure is greatly reduced. only two cycles of subtraction are required. A NotI-CODE procedure can be used to prepare NotI representations (NRs) containing 0.1–0.5% of the total DNA.

It is becoming increasingly clear that each of these two regions contains several TSGs. Until now TSGs which were isolated from AP20 and LUCA regions (e.g.G21/NPRL2. RASSF1A. RASSF1C. SEMA3B. SEMA3F.

Methodology/Principal Findings The effect of expression HYAL1 and HYAL2 was studied by colony formation inhibition. growth curve and cell proliferation tests in vitro and tumour growth assay in vivo. Very modest growth inhibition was detected in vitro in U2020 lung and KRC/Y renal carcinoma cell lines. In the in vivo experiment stably transfected KRC/Y cells expressing HYAL1 or HYAL2 were inoculated into SCID mice (10 and 12 mice respectively). Tumours grew in eight mice inoculated with HYAL1. Ectopic HYAL1 was deleted in all of them. HYAL2 was inoculated into 12 mice and only four tumours were obtained. In 3 of them the gene was deleted. In one tumour it was present but not expressed. As expected for tumour suppressor genes HYAL1 and HYAL2 were down-expressed in 15 fresh lung squamous cell carcinomas (100%) and clear cell RCC tumours (60–67%).  Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that the expression of either gene has led to inhibition of tumour growth in vivo without noticeable effect on growth in vitro.

We used RACA to reconstruct 60 Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) chromosome fragments from 1.434 SOAPdenovo sequence scaffolds. of which 16 chromosome fragments were homologous to …,True,hVpcNAkAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,113,https://www.pnas.org/content/110/5/1785.short,5780121428696546131,/scholar?cites=5780121428696546131,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/110/5/1785.full.pdf,0,0,0

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers can be used for determining parentage and to provide unique molecular identifiers for tracing sheep products to their source. However. the utility of a particular “parentage SNP” varies by breed depending on its minor allele frequency (MAF) and its sequence context. Our aims were to identify parentage SNPs with exceptional qualities for use in globally diverse breeds and to develop a subset for use in North American sheep. Starting with genotypes from 2.915 sheep and 74 breed groups provided by the International Sheep Genomics Consortium (ISGC). we analyzed 47.693 autosomal SNPs by multiple criteria and selected 163 with desirable properties for parentage testing. On average. each of the 163 SNPs was highly informative (MAF≥0.3) in 48±5 breed groups. Nearby polymorphisms that could otherwise confound genetic testing were identified by whole genome and Sanger sequencing of 166 sheep from 54 breed groups. A genetic test with 109 of the 163 parentage SNPs was developed for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The scoring rates and accuracies for these 109 SNPs were greater than 99% in a panel of North American sheep.

The disease phenotype resembles human hereditary arthro-ophthalmopathies such as Stickler and Marshall syndromes. although these disorders are usually dominant. Linkage studies mapped drd1 to canine chromosome 24 and drd2 to canine chromosome 15. Positional candidate gene analysis then led to the identification of a 1-base insertional mutation in exon 1 of COL9A3 that cosegregates with drd1 and a 1.267-bp deletion mutation in the 5′ end of COL9A2 that cosegregates with drd2.

Foxes from the tame strain exhibit friendly behavior towards humans. paralleling the sociability of canine puppies. whereas foxes from the aggressive strain are defensive and exhibit aggression to humans. To understand the genetic differences underlying these behavioral phenotypes fox-specific genomic resources are needed. cDNA from mRNA from pre-frontal cortex of a tame and an aggressive fox was sequenced using the Roche 454 FLX Titanium platform (> 2.5 million reads & 0.9 Gbase of tame fox sequence; >3.3 million reads & 1.2 Gbase of aggressive fox sequence). Over 80% of the fox reads were assembled into contigs. Mapping fox reads against the fox transcriptome assembly and the dog genome identified over 30.000 high confidence fox-specific SNPs. Fox transcripts for approximately 14.000 genes were identified using SwissProt and the dog RefSeq databases. An at least 2-fold expression difference between the two samples (p < 0.05) was observed for 335 genes. fewer than 3% of the total number of genes identified in the fox transcriptome. Transcriptome sequencing significantly expanded genomic resources available for the fox. a species without a sequenced genome.

Selection of foxes. separately. for tame and for aggressive behavior has yielded two strains with markedly different. genetically determined. behavioral phenotypes. Tame strain foxes are eager to establish human contact while foxes from the aggressive strain are aggressive and difficult to handle. These strains have been maintained as separate outbred lines for over 40 generations but their genetic structure has not been previously investigated. We applied a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach to provide insights into the genetic composition of these fox populations. Sequence analysis of EcoT22I genomic libraries of tame and aggressive foxes identified 48.294 high quality SNPs. Population structure analysis revealed genetic divergence between the two strains and more diversity in the aggressive strain than in the tame one. Significant differences in allele frequency between the strains were identified for 68 SNPs. Three of these SNPs were located on fox chromosome 14 within an interval of a previously identified behavioral QTL. further supporting the importance of this region for behavior. The GBS SNP data confirmed that significant genetic diversity has been preserved in both fox populations despite many years of selective breeding. Analysis of SNP allele frequencies in the two populations identified several regions of genetic divergence between the tame and aggressive foxes. some of which may represent targets of selection for behavior.

Bs accumulate through non-Mendelian inheritance and become widespread in populations. Despite the presence of multiple genes. most Bs lack specific phenotypic effects. although their influence on host genome epigenetic status and gene expression are recorded. Previously. using sequencing of isolated Bs of ruminants and rodents. we demonstrated that Bs originate as segmental duplications of specific genomic regions. and subsequently experience pseudogenization and repeat accumulation. Here. we used a similar approach to characterize Bs of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes L.) and the Chinese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides procyonoides Gray). We confirm the previous findings of the KIT gene on Bs of both species. but demostrate an independent origin of Bs in these species. with two reused regions.

Conformational heterogeneity in the active site of the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) has been previously linked to its catalytic function. but the extent to which the different conformations of these residues are correlated is unclear. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of CypA by multitemperature synchrotron crystallography and fixed-target X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) crystallography. The diffraction-before-destruction nature of XFEL experiments provides a radiation-damage-free view of the functionally important alternative conformations of CypA. confirming earlier synchrotron-based results. We monitored the temperature dependences of these alternative conformations with eight synchrotron datasets spanning 100-310 K. Multiconformer models show that many alternative conformations in CypA are populated only at 240 K and above. yet others remain populated or become populated at 180 K and below. These results point to a complex evolution of conformational heterogeneity between 180-–240 K that involves both thermal deactivation and solvent-driven arrest of protein motions in the crystal. The lack of a single shared conformational response to temperature within the dynamic active-site network provides evidence for a conformation shuffling model. in which exchange between rotamer states of a large aromatic ring in the middle of the network shifts the conformational ensemble for the other residues in the network.

In favorable circumstances. various software systems are capable of building over 90% of the final model. However. completeness falls off rapidly with the resolution of the diffraction data. Manual completion of these partial models is usually feasible. but is time-consuming and prone to subjective interpretation. Except for the N- and C-termini of the chain. the end points of each missing fragment are known from the initial model. Hence. fitting fragments reduces to an inverse-kinematics problem.

Crystal structures obtained from high-resolution X-ray diffraction data reflect this heterogeneity as a spatial and temporal conformational average. Although movement between natively populated alternative conformations can be critical for characterizing molecular mechanisms. it is challenging to identify these conformations within electron density maps. Alternative side chain conformations are generally well separated into distinct rotameric conformations. but alternative backbone conformations can overlap at several atomic positions. Our model building program qFit uses mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) to evaluate an extremely large number of combinations of sidechain conformers and backbone fragments to locally explain the electron density. Here. we describe two major modeling enhancements to qFit: peptide flips and alternative glycine conformations. We find that peptide flips fall into four stereotypical clusters and are enriched in glycine residues at the n+1 position. The potential for insights uncovered by new peptide flips and glycine conformations is exemplified by HIV protease. where different inhibitors are associated with peptide flips in the “flap” regions adjacent to the inhibitor binding site. Our results paint a picture of peptide flips as conformational switches. often enabled by glycine flexibility. that result in dramatic local rearrangements.

Conformational heterogeneity in the active site of the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) has been previously linked to its catalytic function. but the extent to which the different conformations of these residues are correlated is unclear. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of CypA by multitemperature synchrotron crystallography and fixed-target X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) crystallography. The diffraction-before-destruction nature of XFEL experiments provides a radiation-damage-free view of the functionally important alternative conformations of CypA. confirming earlier synchrotron-based results. We monitored the temperature dependences of these alternative conformations with eight synchrotron datasets spanning 100-310 K. Multiconformer models show that many alternative conformations in CypA are populated only at 240 K and above. yet others remain populated or become populated at 180 K and below. These results point to a complex evolution of conformational heterogeneity between 180-–240 K that involves both thermal deactivation and solvent-driven arrest of protein motions in the crystal. The lack of a single shared conformational response to temperature within the dynamic active-site network provides evidence for a conformation shuffling model. in which exchange between rotamer states of a large aromatic ring in the middle of the network shifts the conformational ensemble for the other residues in the network.

New modeling approaches reveal 'hidden' low-occupancy conformational states for protein and ligands.

Crystal structures obtained from high-resolution X-ray diffraction data reflect this heterogeneity as a spatial and temporal conformational average. Although movement between natively populated alternative conformations can be critical for characterizing molecular mechanisms. it is challenging to identify these conformations within electron density maps. Alternative side chain conformations are generally well separated into distinct rotameric conformations. but alternative backbone conformations can overlap at several atomic positions. Our model building program qFit uses mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) to evaluate an extremely large number of combinations of sidechain conformers and backbone fragments to locally explain the electron density. Here. we describe two major modeling enhancements to qFit: peptide flips and alternative glycine conformations. We find that peptide flips fall into four stereotypical clusters and are enriched in glycine residues at the n+1 position. The potential for insights uncovered by new peptide flips and glycine conformations is exemplified by HIV protease. where different inhibitors are associated with peptide flips in the “flap” regions adjacent to the inhibitor binding site.

An improved ability to predict realistic backbone changes in response to engineered mutations would be of great utility for the blossoming field of rational protein design. One model that has recently grown in acceptance is the backrub motion. a low-energy dipeptide rotation with single-peptide counter-rotations. that is coupled to dynamic two-state sidechain rotamer jumps. as evidenced by alternate conformations in very high-resolution crystal structures. It has been speculated that backrubs may facilitate sequence changes equally well as rotamer changes. However. backrub-induced shifts and experimental uncertainty are of similar magnitude for backbone atoms in even high-resolution structures. so comparison of wildtype-vs.-mutant crystal structure pairs is not sufficient to directly link backrubs to mutations. In this study. we use two alternative approaches that bypass this limitation. First. we use a quality-filtered structure database to aggregate many examples for precisely defined motifs with single amino acid differences. and find that the effectively amplified backbone differences closely resemble backrubs. Second. we directly apply a provably-accurate. backrub-enabled protein design algorithm to idealized versions of these motifs. and discover that the lowest-energy computed models match the average-coordinate experimental structures.

1102232,Model selection for biological crystallography,2018,Nathan S Babcock and Daniel A Keedy and James S Fraser and David A Sivak,,bioRxiv,,448795,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Structural biologists have fit increasingly complex model types to protein X-ray crystallographic data. motivated by higher-resolving crystals. greater computational power. and a growing appreciation for protein dynamics. Once fit. a more complex model will generally fit the experimental data better. but it also provides greater capacity to overfit to experimental noise. While refinement progress is normally monitored for a given model type with a fixed number of parameters. comparatively little attention has been paid to the selection among distinct model types where the number of parameters can vary. Using metrics derived in the statistical field of model comparison. we develop a framework for statistically rigorous inference of model complexity. From analysis of simulated data. we find that the resulting information criteria are less likely to prefer an erroneously complex model type and are less sensitive to noise. compared to the crystallographic cross-validation criterion Rfree. Moreover. these information criteria suggest caution in using complex model types and for inferring protein conformational heterogeneity from experimental scattering data.,True,TVaqcVwAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/448795v1.abstract,2712686923179794684,/scholar?cites=2712686923179794684,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/10/20/448795.full.pdf,0,0,0

Small-molecule allosteric inhibitors are often desirable; however. it remains challenging to identify surface sites in proteins which can bind small molecules and modulate function. We identified new allosteric sites in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) by combining multiple-temperature X-ray crystallography experiments and structure determination from hundreds of individual small-molecule fragment soaks. New modeling approaches reveal “hidden” low-occupancy conformational states for protein and ligands. Our results converge on a new allosteric site that is conformationally coupled to the active-site WPD loop. a hotspot for fragment binding. not conserved in the closest homolog. and distinct from other recently reported allosteric sites in PTP1B. Targeting this site with covalently tethered molecules allosterically inhibits enzyme activity. Overall. this work demonstrates how the ensemble nature of macromolecular structure revealed by multitemperature crystallography can be exploited for developing allosteric modulators.,True,TVaqcVwAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/218966v1.abstract,2141019397167730411,/scholar?cites=2141019397167730411,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/11/13/218966.full.pdf,0,0,0

They are designed to complement and add value to the traditional template-based assessment by the global distance test (GDT) and related scores (based on multiple superpositions of Ca atoms between target structure and predictions labeled ‘‘Model 1’’). The new metrics evaluate each predictor group on each target. using all atoms of their best model with above-average GDT. Two metrics evaluate how ‘‘protein-like’’the predicted model is: the MolProbity score used for validating experimental structures. and a mainchain reality score using all-atom steric clashes. bond length and angle outliers. and backbone dihedrals. Four other new metrics evaluate match of model to target for mainchain and sidechain hydrogen bonds. sidechain end positioning. and sidechain rotamers. Group-average Z-score across the six fullmodel measures is averaged with group-average GDT Z-score to produce the overall ranking for full-model. high-accuracy performance. Separate assessments are reported for specific aspects of predictor-group performance. such as robustness of approximately correct template or fold identification. and self-scoring ability at identifying the best of their models. Fold identification is distinct from but correlated with group-average GDT Z-score if target difficulty is taken into account. whereas self-scoring is done best by servers and is uncorrelated with GDT performance.

Receptor trimerization by extracellular ligands initiates signaling by recruiting members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of adapter proteins to the receptor cytoplasmic domains. We report the 2.4-Å crystal structure of a 22-kDa. receptor-binding fragment of TRAF2 complexed with a functionally defined peptide from the cytoplasmic domain of the CD40 receptor. TRAF2 forms a mushroom-shaped trimer consisting of a coiled coil and a unique β-sandwich domain. Both domains mediate trimerization. The CD40 peptide binds in an extended conformation with every side chain in contact with a complementary groove on the rim of each TRAF monomer.

We report here the crystal structure of a complex between the C-terminal domain from NEDD8's heterodimeric E1 (APPBP1-UBA3) and the catalytic core domain of NEDD8's E2 (Ubc12). The structure and associated mutational analyses reveal molecular details of Ubc12 recruitment by NEDD8's E1. Interestingly. the E1's Ubc12 binding domain resembles ubiquitin and recruits Ubc12 in a manner mimicking ubiquitin's interactions with ubiquitin binding domains. Structural comparison with E2-E3 complexes indicates that the E1 and E3 binding sites on Ubc12 may overlap and raises the possibility that crosstalk between E1 and E3 interacting with an E2 could influence the …,True,X8ECs3UAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,191,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276505010026,10835273132642133478,/scholar?cites=10835273132642133478,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276505010026,0,0,0

Conformational heterogeneity in the active site of the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) has been previously linked to its catalytic function. but the extent to which the different conformations of these residues are correlated is unclear. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of CypA by multitemperature synchrotron crystallography and fixed-target X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) crystallography. The diffraction-before-destruction nature of XFEL experiments provides a radiation-damage-free view of the functionally important alternative conformations of CypA. confirming earlier synchrotron-based results. We monitored the temperature dependences of these alternative conformations with eight synchrotron datasets spanning 100-310 K. Multiconformer models show that many alternative conformations in CypA are populated only at 240 K and above. yet others remain populated or become populated at 180 K and below. These results point to a complex evolution of conformational heterogeneity between 180-–240 K that involves both thermal deactivation and solvent-driven arrest of protein motions in the crystal. The lack of a single shared conformational response to temperature within the dynamic active-site network provides evidence for a conformation shuffling model. in which exchange between rotamer states of a large aromatic ring in the middle of the network shifts the conformational ensemble for the other residues in the network.

However. this use of TLS models in mechanistic studies is hampered by the difficulties in translating the results of refinement into molecular movement or a structural ensemble. To convert the matrices into a constituent molecular movement. the matrix elements must satisfy several conditions. Refining the T.

Because Bragg diffraction describes the average positional distribution of crystalline atoms with imperfect precision. the resulting electron density can be compatible with multiple models of motion. Diffuse X-ray scattering can reduce this degeneracy by reporting on correlated atomic displacements. Although recent technological advances are increasing the potential to accurately measure diffuse scattering. computational modeling and validation tools are still needed to quantify the agreement between experimental data and different parameterizations of crystalline disorder.

Successfully accomplishing these tasks is of the utmost importance across many disciplines. and can lead to powerful technological advancements. prevention of catastrophic failures and the generation of significant economic gain. Dozens of algorithms have been developed to solve these problems. including AR (I) MA regression (Däubener. Schmitt. Wang. Bäck. & Krause. 2019). Hierarchical Temporal Memory (Ahmad & Purdy. 2016). Extreme Studentized Deviate (Däubener et al.. 2019) and Artificial Neural Networks (Bishop. 2006).

Although modeling the motion of individual atoms is straightforward. combining these movements into descriptions of macromolecular function proves more difficult. X-ray crystallography produces atomic-level visualizations of an ensemble of countless molecules; however. current methods capture only the average protein conformation and thus cannot completely describe the underlying dynamics. A parallel source of information. diffuse scattering. is present in diffraction images and directly reports on correlated atomic motions.I created experimental and computational tools to measure macromolecular diffuse scattering and compare it against hypotheses of correlated motion. The first tool. phenix.diffuse. calculates diffuse scattering patterns from known structural ensembles. I applied this software to the refinement technique Translation-Libration-Screw and solved a pre-existing degeneracy within the predicted motion of glycerophosphodiesterase GpdQ. Surprisingly. I also uncovered a fundamental flaw in the implementation of TLS refinement in structural biology software. revealing unphysical motions to be present in nearly 25% of all known macromolecular structures.Next. I developed the comprehensive pipeline DIALS-LUNUS for the measurement of macromolecular diffuse scattering.

The maximum likelihood target reduces the significance of false local minima during the refinement process. but it does not completely eliminate them. necessitating the use of stochastic optimization methods such as simulated annealing for poor initial models. It is shown that the combination of maximum likelihood with cross-validation. which reduces overfitting. and simulated annealing by torsion angle molecular dynamics. which simplifies the conformational search problem. results in a major improvement of the radius of convergence of refinement and the accuracy of the refined structure.

As these maps are also used to validate the atomic models that result from model building and refinement. this constitutes an immediate problem: anything added to the model will manifest itself in the map and thus hinder the validation. OMIT maps are a common tool to verify the presence of atoms in the model. The simplest way to compute an OMIT map is to exclude the atoms in question from the structure. update the corresponding structure factors and compute a residual map. It is then expected that if these atoms are present in the crystal structure. the electron density for the omitted atoms will be seen as positive features in this map.

However. at these resolutions. accurately positioning individual atoms remains challenging and error-prone. Manually refining thousands of amino acids – typical in a macromolecular assembly – is tedious and time-consuming. We present an automated method that can improve the atomic details in models that are manually built in near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM maps. Applying the method to three systems recently solved by cryo-EM. we are able to improve model geometry while maintaining the fit-to-density. Backbone placement errors are automatically detected and corrected. and the refinement shows a large radius of convergence. The results demonstrate that the method is amenable to structures with symmetry. of very large size. and containing RNA as well as covalently bound ligands.

However. recent deep sequencing studies indicate that ubiquitin is highly tolerant to single mutations. We hypothesized that this tolerance would be reduced by chemically induced physiologic perturbations. To test this hypothesis. a class of first year UCSF graduate students employed deep mutational scanning to determine the fitness landscape of all possible single residue mutations in the presence of five different small molecule perturbations. These perturbations uncover 'shared sensitized positions' localized to areas around the hydrophobic patch and the C-terminus. In addition. we identified perturbation specific effects such as a sensitization of His68 in HU and a tolerance to mutation at Lys63 in DTT.

We report that the metabolic regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase1 (PDHK1) is a synthetic-essential gene in PTEN-deficient cancer and normal cells. The PTEN protein phosphatase dephosphorylates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-activating protein (NKAP) and limits NFκB activation to suppress expression of PDHK1. a NF-κB target gene. Loss of the PTEN protein phosphatase upregulates PDHK1 to induce aerobic glycolysis and PDHK1 cellular dependence. PTEN-deficient human tumors harbor increased PDHK1. a biomarker of decreased patient survival.

Inc.,Chitin is an abundant polysaccharide used by many organisms for structural rigidity and water repulsion. As such. the insoluble crystalline structure of chitin poses significant challenges for enzymatic degradation. Acidic mammalian chitinase. a processive glycosyl hydrolase. is the primary enzyme involved in the degradation of environmental chitin in mammalian lungs. Mutations to acidic mammalian chitinase have been associated with asthma. and genetic deletion in mice increases morbidity and mortality with age. We initially set out to reverse this phenotype by engineering hyperactive acidic mammalian chitinase variants. Using a screening approach with commercial fluorogenic substrates. we identified mutations with consistent increases in activity. To determine whether the activity increases observed were consistent with more biologically relevant chitin substrates. we developed new assays to quantify …,True,XDH9FrwAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,3,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pro.3822,5722958976496850727,/scholar?cites=5722958976496850727,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pro.3822,0,0,0
1102309,Maximizing Interpretability from Complex Experiments in Structural Biology and Biochemistry,2019,Benjamin Asher Barad,,,,,,Proteins are complex macromolecules whose structure informs their function and regulation in difficult to predict ways. Understanding their shape. dynamics. and regulation all pose major challenges in terms of collecting. analyzing. and interpreting data. In my dissertation I describe two contributions to data analysis for determining the structure and dynamics of proteins using novel approaches. as well as experimental work querying the function of an enzyme with a particularly recalcitrant substrate.  In the first chapter of this dissertation. I develop a tool. EMRinger. for the emerging field of high resolution electron microscopy that takes advantage of prior physical information about model geometry to more effectively determine if the model is built correctly into the map. This work adapted the tool Ringer. which had been previously developed in the Alber lab. in order to  identify the dihedral angle for side chains with the greatest density. and confirm that the distribution of those peak positions does not violate the constraints of side chain dihedral angles to rotameric positions. This approach allows for orthogonal validation of backbone position in density (using the side chain density as a “lever”). which generally improves with refinement and is among the most sensitive model-in-map validation tools available for high resolution electron microscopy. In the second chapter. I present progress on applying temperature jumps to folded proteins to quantify kinetics of the intrinsic motions in proteins that impact their function and regulation. Using a pulsed infrared laser. we raise the temperature of a protein solution in nanoseconds. and follow the progression …,True,XDH9FrwAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,0,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8t7048v8,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt8t7048v8/qt8t7048v8.pdf,0,0,0

To address this problem. we compiled nearly 200.000 phosphorylation. acetylation. and ubiquitination sites from 11 eukaryotic species. including 2.500 newly identified ubiquitylation sites for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We developed methods to prioritize the functional relevance of these PTMs by predicting those that likely participate in cross-regulatory events. regulate domain activity. or mediate protein-protein interactions.

Conformational heterogeneity in the active site of the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) has been previously linked to its catalytic function. but the extent to which the different conformations of these residues are correlated is unclear. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of CypA by multitemperature synchrotron crystallography and fixed-target X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) crystallography. The diffraction-before-destruction nature of XFEL experiments provides a radiation-damage-free view of the functionally important alternative conformations of CypA. confirming earlier synchrotron-based results. We monitored the temperature dependences of these alternative conformations with eight synchrotron datasets spanning 100-310 K. Multiconformer models show that many alternative conformations in CypA are populated only at 240 K and above. yet others remain populated or become populated at 180 K and below. These results point to a complex evolution of conformational heterogeneity between 180-–240 K that involves both thermal deactivation and solvent-driven arrest of protein motions in the crystal. The lack of a single shared conformational response to temperature within the dynamic active-site network provides evidence for a conformation shuffling model. in which exchange between rotamer states of a large aromatic ring in the middle of the network shifts the conformational ensemble for the other residues in the network.

However. recent deep sequencing studies indicate that ubiquitin is highly tolerant to single mutations. We hypothesized that this tolerance would be reduced by chemically induced physiologic perturbations. To test this hypothesis. a class of first year UCSF graduate students employed deep mutational scanning to determine the fitness landscape of all possible single residue mutations in the presence of five different small molecule perturbations. These perturbations uncover 'shared sensitized positions' localized to areas around the hydrophobic patch and the C-terminus. In addition. we identified perturbation specific effects such as a sensitization of His68 in HU and a tolerance to mutation at Lys63 in DTT. Our data show how chemical stresses can reduce buffering effects in the ubiquitin proteasome system.

We show both kinetically. using NMR spectroscopy. and structurally. by room-temperature X-ray crystallography. how local perturbations propagate through a large allosteric network to facilitate conformational dynamics.

These cryptic sites require a conformational change to become apparent; a cryptic site can therefore be defined as a site that forms a pocket in a holo structure. but not in the apo structure. Because many proteins appear to lack druggable pockets. understanding and accurately identifying cryptic sites could expand the set of drug targets. Previously. cryptic sites were identified experimentally by fragment-based ligand discovery and computationally by long molecular dynamics simulations and fragment docking. Here. we begin by constructing a set of structurally defined apo–holo pairs with cryptic sites.

This important step in the viral life cycle relies on matrix protein 2 (M2). a pH-regulated proton channel embedded in the lipid envelope of the virus. M2 has been a subject of intense study both because it the target of adamantane compounds that can be used to treat flu and because it is an ideal model system to study proton conduction across membranes. The structural location of ordered water within the M2 channel plays a key role in both of these areas. Ordered water molecules are proposed to make key bridging interactions between adamantane compounds and the protein. Additionally. there is significant debate about the existence “water wires” of ordered solvent molecules that allow proton conduction by connecting the viral exterior and interior. It is therefore critical to determine the distribution of water molecules within the channel. Previous high resolution X-ray data of the M2 channel crystallized in the lipid sponge phase revealed interesting differences in the distributions of water as a function of pH. However. preliminary room temperature data called into question whether data collected from cryo-cooled crystals was informative for biologically relevant mechanisms of proton transport. Unfortunately. damage to the small M2 crystals from the radiation dose at room temperature precluded mechanistic interpretations of the solvent density.

Understanding what causes these fluctuations and how they are translated to the larger motions is essential for understanding the basic mechanism of many biological systems. The ability to control the fluctuations in a predictable way would significantly improve our rational drug and protein design efforts. But. often the important fluctuation that control conformational of proteins are not known. This is in part due to lack of experimental techniques that bridge these scales. Furthermore. computational efforts to meet this need are a work in progress. This thesis describes efforts to understand the mechanistic basis of large-scale motions in different biological systems by developing and applying new tools for the measurement of conformational dynamics. We  probed the conformational dynamics of the enzyme CypA using X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) to validate a known allosteric pathway of the enzyme with this radiation damage free technique. We studied differences in conformation dynamics and allosteric ligand accessibility in αI-domain containing integrins using NMR and room temperature crystallography. By comparing the conformational heterogeneity of two homologous integrins. we have found evidence that the conformational landscape critically influences their ability to bind allosteric modulators.

The exterior shell of this elaborate protein complex is composed from a few thousand copies of BMC‐domain shell proteins. which form a semi‐permeable diffusion barrier that provides the interior enzymes with substrates and cofactors while simultaneously retaining metabolic intermediates. The ability of this protein shell to regulate passage of substrate and cofactor molecules is critical for microcompartment function. but the details of how this diffusion barrier can allow the passage of large cofactors while still retaining small intermediates remain unclear.

Thus. a signal-directed change in the activity of the regulator protein can result in one of three patterns of coupled regulator and effector gene expression: direct coupling. in which regulator and effector gene expression change in the same direction; uncoupling. in which regulator gene expression remains constant while effector gene expression changes; or inverse coupling. in which regulator and effector gene expression change in opposite directions.

These motions frequently entail large-scale conformational changes that induce changes in the surface structure. or shape. of a molecule.

To enable such control. protein activity. and therefore protein conformational distributions. must be susceptible to alteration by molecular interactions at functional sites. Here we investigate whether interactions at functional sites cause a large change in the protein conformational distribution. We apply a computational method. called dynamics perturbation analysis (DPA). to identify sites at which interactions have a large allosteric potential Dx. which is the Kullback–Leibler divergence between protein conformational distributions with and without an interaction. In DPA. a protein is decorated with surface points that interact with neighboring protein atoms. and Dx is calculated for each of the points in a coarse-grained model of protein vibrations.

The information in Bragg scattering is limited to what is available in the mean electron density. The diffuse scattering arises from correlations in the electron density variations and therefore contains information about collective motions in proteins.

1102407,Fast dynamics perturbation analysis for prediction of protein functional sites,2008,Dengming Ming and Judith D Cohn and Michael E Wall,8,BMC structural biology,1,1-11,BioMed Central,We present a fast version of the dynamics perturbation analysis (DPA) algorithm to predict functional sites in protein structures. The original DPA algorithm finds regions in proteins where interactions cause a large change in the protein conformational distribution. as measured using the relative entropy D                     x                   . Such regions are associated with functional sites. The Fast DPA algorithm. which accelerates DPA calculations. is motivated by an empirical observation that D                     x                   in a normal-modes model is highly correlated with an entropic term that only depends on the eigenvalues of the normal modes. The eigenvalues are accurately estimated using first-order perturbation theory. resulting in a N-fold reduction in the overall computational requirements of the algorithm. where N is the number of residues in the protein. The performance of the original and Fast DPA algorithms was compared using protein structures from a standard small-molecule docking test set. For nominal implementations of each algorithm. top-ranked Fast DPA predictions overlapped the true binding site 94% of the time. compared to 87% of the time for original DPA. In addition. per-protein recall statistics (fraction of binding-site residues that are among predicted residues) were slightly better for Fast DPA. On the other hand. per-protein precision statistics (fraction of predicted residues that are among binding-site residues) were slightly better using original DPA. Overall. the performance of Fast DPA in predicting ligand-binding-site residues was comparable to that of the original DPA algorithm.

Numerical analysis of equations describing regulation by artificial inducers revealed two natural bistability parameters that can be used to control the range of inducer concentrations over which the model exhibits bistability.

The structure analysis was carried out using Dynamics Perturbation Analysis (DPA). which predicts functional sites at control points where interactions greatly perturb protein vibrations. The text mining extracts mentions of residues in the literature. and predicts that residues mentioned are functionally important. We assessed the significance of each of these methods by analyzing their performance in finding known functional sites (specifically. small-molecule binding sites and catalytic sites) in about 100.000 publicly available protein structures. The DPA predictions recapitulated many of the functional site annotations and preferentially recovered binding sites annotated as biologically relevant vs. those annotated as potentially spurious. The text-based predictions were also substantially supported by the functional site annotations: compared to other residues. residues mentioned in text were roughly six times more likely to be found in a functional site. The overlap of predictions with annotations improved when the text-based and structure-based methods agreed. Our analysis also yielded new high-quality predictions of many functional site residues that were not catalogued in the curated data sources we inspected. We conclude that both DPA and text mining independently provide valuable high-throughput protein functional site predictions. and that integrating the two methods using LEAP-FS further improves the quality of these predictions.,True,s3zbV24AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,30,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032171,6255694978006726458,/scholar?cites=6255694978006726458,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032171,0,0,0

Activation of marA/soxS/rob regulon promoters occurs in a well-defined order with respect to the level of MarA; however. the order of activation does not parallel the strength of MarA binding to promoter sequences. To understand this lack of correspondence. we developed a computational model of transcriptional activation in which a transcription factor either increases or decreases RNA polymerase binding. and either accelerates or retards post-binding events associated with transcription initiation. We used the model to analyze data characterizing MarA regulation of promoter activity. The model clearly explains the lack of correspondence between the order of activation and the MarA-DNA affinity and indicates that the order of activation can only be predicted using information about the strength of the full MarA-polymerase-DNA interaction. The analysis further suggests that MarA can activate without increasing polymerase binding and that activation can even involve a decrease in polymerase binding. which is opposite to the textbook model of activation by recruitment. These findings are consistent with published chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of interactions between polymerase and the E. coli chromosome. We find that activation involving decreased polymerase binding yields lower latency in gene regulation and therefore might confer a competitive advantage to cells.

However. at these resolutions. accurately positioning individual atoms remains challenging and error-prone. Manually refining thousands of amino acids – typical in a macromolecular assembly – is tedious and time-consuming.

RosettaCM. which optimizes a physically realistic all-atom energy function over the conformational space defined by homologous structures. Given a set of sequence alignments. RosettaCM assembles topologies by recombining aligned segments in Cartesian space and building unaligned regions de novo in torsion space.

The energies of the resulting models are optimized by all-atom refinement. and the most representative low-energy model is selected.

However. at these resolutions. accurately positioning individual atoms remains challenging and error-prone. Manually refining thousands of amino acids – typical in a macromolecular assembly – is tedious and time-consuming. We present an automated method that can improve the atomic details in models that are manually built in near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM maps. Applying the method to three systems recently solved by cryo-EM. we are able to improve model geometry while maintaining the fit-to-density. Backbone placement errors are automatically detected and corrected. and the refinement shows a large radius of convergence.

However. the experimentally observed native state is at a minimum of the free energy. rather than the energy. The neglect of the missing configurational entropy contribution to the free energy can be partially justified by the assumption that the entropies of alternative folded states. while very much less than unfolded states. are not too different from one another. and hence can be to a first approximation neglected when searching for the lowest free energy state. The shortcomings of current structure prediction methods may be due in part to the breakdown of this assumption. Particularly problematic are proteins with significant disordered regions which do not populate single low energy conformations even in the native state. We describe two approaches within the Rosetta structure modeling methodology for treating such regions. The first does not require advance knowledge of the regions likely to be disordered; instead these are identified by minimizing a simple free energy function used previously to model protein folding landscapes and transition states. In this model. residues can be either completely ordered or completely disordered; they are considered disordered if the gain in entropy outweighs the loss of favorable energetic interactions with the rest of the protein chain. The second approach requires identification in advance of the disordered regions either from sequence alone using for example the DISOPRED server or from experimental data such as NMR chemical shifts.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a model client that constantly depends on Hsp90 for activity. Previously. we revealed GR ligand binding is inhibited by Hsp70 and restored by Hsp90. aided by the cochaperone p23. However. a molecular understanding of the chaperone-induced transformations that occur between the inactive Hsp70:Hsp90 client-loading complex and an activated Hsp90:p23 client-maturation complex is lacking for GR. or for any client. Here. we present a 2.56A cryo-EM structure of the GR-maturation complex (GR:Hsp90:p23). revealing that the GR ligand binding domain is. surprisingly. restored to a folded. ligand-bound conformation. while simultaneously threaded through the Hsp90 lumen. Also. unexpectedly. p23 directly stabilizes native GR using a previously uncharacterized C-terminal helix. resulting in enhanced ligand-binding.

Here we describe the structure determination of the Cry3A toxin found naturally crystallized within Bt cells. When whole Bt cells were streamed into an X-ray free-electron laser beam we found that scattering from other cell components did not obscure diffraction from the crystals. The resolution limits of the best diffraction images collected from cells were the same as from isolated crystals. The integrity of the cells at the moment of diffraction is unclear; however. given the short time (∼5 µs) between exiting the injector to intersecting with the X-ray beam. our result is a 2.9-Å-resolution structure of a crystalline protein as it exists in a living cell.

Conformational heterogeneity in the active site of the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) has been previously linked to its catalytic function. but the extent to which the different conformations of these residues are correlated is unclear. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of CypA by multitemperature synchrotron crystallography and fixed-target X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) crystallography. The diffraction-before-destruction nature of XFEL experiments provides a radiation-damage-free view of the functionally important alternative conformations of CypA. confirming earlier synchrotron-based results. We monitored the temperature dependences of these alternative conformations with eight synchrotron datasets spanning 100-310 K. Multiconformer models show that many alternative conformations in CypA are populated only at 240 K and above. yet others remain populated or become populated at 180 K and below. These results point to a complex evolution of conformational heterogeneity between 180-–240 K that involves both thermal deactivation and solvent-driven arrest of protein motions in the crystal. The lack of a single shared conformational response to temperature within the dynamic active-site network provides evidence for a conformation shuffling model. in which exchange between rotamer states of a large aromatic ring in the middle of the network shifts the conformational ensemble for the other residues in the network. Together. our multitemperature analyses and XFEL data motivate a new …,True,f-rQ8e4AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,94,https://elifesciences.org/articles/07574,8543462087058875705,/scholar?cites=8543462087058875705,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/07574.pdf,0,0,0

Automation. high brilliance beamlines at 3rd generation synchrotron sources and high frame-rate pixel array detectors have together enabled extremely rapid collection of most MX datasets. In tandem. large area photon-counting detection. microfocus beams and high quality X-ray optics have brought more challenging projects within reach. Thus there is a clear need for diffraction data analysis software designed to cope with the ever increasing volumes and rates of data collection. and with the developments in experimental methodology. from shutterless. fine-sliced rotation scans through to the thousands of randomly-oriented snapshots of serial crystallography.

A clearer understanding of this intrinsic circuitry would afford new opportunities to modulate protein function. Here. we have identified allosteric sites in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) by combining multiple-temperature X-ray crystallography experiments and structure determination from hundreds of individual small-molecule fragment soaks. New modeling approaches reveal 'hidden' low-occupancy conformational states for protein and ligands. Our results converge on allosteric sites that are conformationally coupled to the active-site WPD loop and are hotspots for fragment binding. Targeting one of these sites with covalently tethered molecules or mutations allosterically inhibits enzyme activity.

To test this idea. we exploited advances in multiconformer modeling of room-temperature X-ray data collection on redesigned ubiquitin variants selected for increasing binding affinity to the deubiquitinase USP7. Initial core mutations disrupt natural packing and lead to increased flexibility.

It is well understood that deviations from this model occur. but the majority of peptides are planar. as measured by the standard omega torsion angle. Here. we report the first analysis in proteins of the contribution of pyramidalization of the peptide nitrogen to peptide non-planarity in proteins. We do this by considering peptide bonds before proline residues. as in such prolyl-peptides the peptide hydrogen is replaced by a carbon atom in the proline side chain–allowing its pyramidalization to be accurately assessed in ultra-high resolution structures. Our results show that peptides deviate more from planarity than previous studies have detected. and in fact. are not even planar on average. Additionally. our data show. in agreement with early small molecule and peptide research. that the nitrogen atom in prolyl peptides is generally pyramidalized. and plays an almost equal role in generating deviations from planarity as does pure rotation. Correlation analyses show that local conformational features only explain a small fraction of the variability in planarity in real structures.

Although this enzymatic activity is exceedingly rare among bacteria more broadly. analysis of the Human Microbiome Project data demonstrate that at least 10% of the human population harbors at least one bacterium encoding a tryptophan decarboxylase in their gut community.

Attempts to engineer their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to produce unnatural metabolites with improved properties are often frustrated by the unpredictability and complexity of the enzymes that synthesize these molecules. suggesting that genetic changes within BGCs are limited by specific constraints. Here. by performing a systematic computational analysis of BGC evolution. we derive evidence for three findings that shed light on the ways in which. despite these constraints. nature successfully invents new molecules: 1) BGCs for complex molecules often evolve through the successive merger of smaller sub-clusters. which function as independent evolutionary entities. 2) An important subset of polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases evolve by concerted evolution. which generates sets of sequence-homogenized domains that may hold promise for engineering efforts since they exhibit a high degree of functional interoperability. 3) Individual BGC families evolve in distinct ways. suggesting that design strategies should take into account family-specific functional constraints.

However. divergence in function between the iP and the constitutive proteasome (cP) has been unclear. A global peptide library-based screening strategy revealed that the proteasomes have overlapping but distinct substrate specificities. Differing iP specificity alters the quantity of production of certain MHC I epitopes but does not appear to be preferentially suited for antigen presentation. Furthermore. iP specificity was found to have likely arisen through genetic drift from the ancestral cP. Specificity differences were exploited to develop isoform-selective substrates.

Upon infection. a temperate phage can either kill the host cell or be maintained as a prophage. In this state. the bacteria carrying the prophage is at risk of superinfection. where another phage injects its genetic material and competes for host cell resources. To avoid this. many phages have evolved mechanisms that alter the bacteria and make it resistant to phage superinfection. The mechanisms underlying these phentoypic conversions and the fitness consequences for the host are poorly understood. and systematic studies of superinfection exclusion mechanisms are lacking. In this study. we examined a wide range of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages and found that they mediate superinfection exclusion through a variety of mechanisms. some of which affected the type IV pilus and O-antigen. and others that functioned inside the cell.

Small bacteriophage-encoded anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) can inactivate Cas9. providing an efficient off switch for Cas9-based applications. Here. we show that two Acrs.

AcrIIC1 is a broad-spectrum Cas9 inhibitor that prevents DNA cutting by multiple divergent Cas9 orthologs through direct binding to the conserved HNH catalytic domain of Cas9. A crystal structure of an AcrIIC1-Cas9 HNH domain complex shows how AcrIIC1 traps Cas9 in a DNA-bound but catalytically inactive state. By contrast. AcrIIC3 blocks activity of a single Cas9 ortholog and induces Cas9 dimerization while preventing binding to the target DNA.

1102579,Site-directed fragment discovery for allostery,2016,T Justin Rettenmaier and Sean A Hudson and James A Wells,,,,,Wiley,Protein allostery is one of the most prevalent and intriguing mechanisms for regulating protein function [1]. Allostery is mediated through conformational changes where binding at one site remotely affects binding at another. Allosteric ligands can turn proteins on or off. and can even do so by binding at the same allosteric site. For example. the binding of ligands to allosteric sites in G-proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs). nuclear receptors. and enzymes can remotely control their ability to interact with other proteins or substrates. which can result in a wide range of functional outcomes.Allosteric sites have been of increasing interest in the drug discovery community. Such sites are often less conserved than enzyme active sites that require strict retention and orientation of catalytic and substrate binding sites. Thus. allosteric sites can afford lower hurdles for selectivity. and have the option to either activate or inhibit the target protein. Also. active sites can be challenging when they bind highly charged or large diffuse substrates that are not easily mimicked by drug-like small molecules.

Single alanine mutations (62 in total) were introduced at every residue contained within the three discontinuous segments of hGH (residues 2 to 19. 54 to 74. and 167 to 191) that have been implicated in receptor recognition. The alanine scan revealed a cluster of a dozen large side chains that when mutated to alanine each showed more than a four times lower binding affinity to the hGH receptor. Many of these residues that promote binding to the hGH receptor are altered in homologs of hGH (such as placental lactogens and prolactins) that do not bind tightly to the hGH receptor.

Addition of hGH to a myeloid leukemia cell line (FDC-P1) that expressed the hybrid receptor caused proliferation of these cells. The mechanism for signal transduction of the hybrid receptor required dimerization because monoclonal antibodies to the hGH receptor were agonists whereas their monovalent fragments were not. Receptor dimerization occurs sequentially—a receptor binds to site 1 on hGH. and then a second receptor molecule binds to site 2 on hGH.

We have determined its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.5 Å. and identified its kinase domain receptor (KDR) binding site using mutational analysis. Overall. the VEGF monomer resembles that of PDGF. but its N-terminal segment is helical rather than extended. The dimerization mode of VEGF is similar to that of PDGF and very different from that of TGF-β.

1102604,Binding in the growth hormone receptor complex,1996,James A Wells,93,,1,1-6,National Academy of Sciences,Binding reactions between human growth hormone (hGH) and its receptor provide a detailed account of how a polypeptide hormone activates its receptor and more generally how proteins interact. Through high-resolution structural and functional studies it is seen that hGH uses two different sites (site 1 and site 2) to bind two identical receptor molecules. This sequential dimerization reaction activates the receptor. presumably by bringing the intracellular domains into close proximity so they may activate cytosolic components. As a consequence of this mechanism it is possible to build antagonists to the receptor by introducing mutations in hGH that block binding at site 2 and to build even more potent antagonists by combining these with mutants that enhance binding at site 1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of all contact residues at the site 1 interface shows that only a small and complementary set of side chains …,True,QSqqTVgAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,535,https://www.pnas.org/content/93/1/1.short,3539611656989381269,/scholar?cites=3539611656989381269,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/93/1/1.full.pdf,0,0,0

A native or engineered cysteine in a protein is allowed to react reversibly with a small library of disulfide-containing molecules (≈1.200 compounds) at concentrations typically used in drug screening (10 to 200 μM). The cysteine-captured ligands. which are readily identified by MS. are among the most stable complexes. even though in the absence of the covalent tether the ligands may bind very weakly. This method was applied to generate a potent inhibitor for thymidylate synthase. an essential enzyme in pyrimidine metabolism with therapeutic applications in cancer and infectious diseases.

Mutational analysis is a powerful approach for identifying protein–protein interfaces. A scanning-mutagenesis method is applied to the interactions between human growth hormone (hGH) and its receptors. Molecular recognition is a key component in virtually all biochemical processes. many of which involve protein–protein interactions. Defining these interactions requires both a high-resolution structure showing the positions of interacting groups and detailed functional data giving the energetic importance of amino acid side chains at or near the interface. Generally. the latter information is more easily obtained if one has a suitable expression system and a simple method for analyzing or screening for binding.

By adjusting the reaction conditions and purification procedure. it was possible to isolate hGH derivatives containing up to seven PEG moieties that altered the Stokes radius and thereby the effective molecular masses of the unmodified hormone from 22 to 300 kDa. Fortunately. the most reactive amines were ones that did not lie in either of the two sites important for receptor binding. Nonetheless. increasing the level of PEG modification linearly reduced the affinity of hGH for its receptor and increased the EC50 in a cell-based assay up to 1500-fold.

Single-species model organism anatomy ontologies (ssAOs) have been established to represent this variation. Multi-species anatomy ontologies (msAOs; vertebrate skeletal. vertebrate homologous. teleost. amphibian AOs) have been developed to represent ‘natural’ phenotypic variation across species. Our aim has been to integrate ssAOs and msAOs for various purposes. including establishing links between phenotypic variation and candidate genes. Previously. msAOs contained a mixture of unique and overlapping content. This hampered integration and coordination due to the need to maintain cross-references or inter-ontology equivalence axioms to the ssAOs. or to perform large-scale obsolescence and modular import. Here we present the unification of anatomy ontologies into Uberon. a single ontology resource that enables interoperability among disparate data and research groups. As a consequence. independent development of TAO. VSAO. AAO. and vHOG has been discontinued. The newly broadened Uberon ontology is a unified cross-taxon resource for metazoans (animals) that has been substantially expanded to include a broad diversity of vertebrate anatomical structures. permitting reasoning across anatomical variation in extinct and extant taxa.

Traditionally. these descriptions have been expressed in natural language within the context of individual journal publications or monographs. As such. this rich store of phenotype data has been largely unavailable for statistical and computational comparisons across studies or integration with other biological knowledge.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe Phenex. a platform-independent desktop application designed to facilitate efficient and consistent annotation of phenotypic similarities and differences using Entity-Quality syntax. drawing on terms from community ontologies for anatomical entities. phenotypic qualities. and taxonomic names. Phenex can be configured to load only those ontologies pertinent to a taxonomic group of interest. The graphical user interface was optimized for evolutionary biologists accustomed to working with lists of taxa. characters. character states. and character-by-taxon matrices.  Conclusions/Significance Annotation of phenotypic data using ontologies and globally unique taxonomic identifiers will allow biologists to integrate phenotypic data from different organisms and studies. leveraging decades of work in systematics and comparative morphology.,True,ZKnlvcoAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,88,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010500,4387829699785876130,/scholar?cites=4387829699785876130,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010500,0,0,0

Phylogenetic hypotheses are critical in interpreting the patterns of evolution of developmental genes and processes. as are morphological data. Using a robust phylogeny. the evolutionary history of individual morphological or developmental features can be traced and ancestral conditions inferred. Multiple characters (e.g.. morphological and developmental) can be mapped together on the phylogeny. and patterns of character association can be quantified and tested for correlation.Using the vertebrate forelimb as an example.

Transformational information is used to construct hypotheses of character state homology. polarity. and order. Character state order refers to the evolutionary connections among character states. whereas polarity refers to the direction of evolution along hypothesized connections (i.e.. which character conditions are primitive and which are derived).

The Aux/IAA and ARF gene families. consisting of 29 and 23 loci in Arabidopsis. respectively. encode proteins that interact to mediate auxin responses and regulate various aspects of plant morphological development. We developed scenarios for the genomic proliferation of the Aux/IAA and ARF families by combining phylogenetic analysis with information on the relationship between each locus and the previously identified duplicated genomic segments in Arabidopsis. This analysis shows that both gene families date back at least to the origin of land plants and that the major Aux/IAA and ARF lineages originated before the monocot-eudicot divergence. We found that the extant Aux/IAA loci arose primarily through segmental duplication …,True,SJ7rKLoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,307,http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/135/3/1738.short,8713867412148237465,/scholar?cites=8713867412148237465,,http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/plantphysiol/135/3/1738.full.pdf,0,0,0

We have examined patterns of gene expression and coding sequence divergence between duplicated genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Due to the simultaneous origin of polyploidy-derived gene pairs. we can compare covariation in the rates of expression divergence and sequence divergence within this group. Among tandem and dispersed duplicates. much of the divergence in expression profile appears to occur at or shortly after duplication. Contrary to findings from other eukaryotic systems. there is little relationship between expression divergence and synonymous substitutions. whereas there is a strong positive relationship between expression divergence and nonsynonymous substitutions.

We demonstrate that. to construct a map with high genome-wide marker density. it is neither necessary nor desirable to genotype all markers in every individual of a large mapping population. Instead. a reduced sample of individuals bearing complementary recombinational or radiation-induced breakpoints may be selected for genotyping subsequent markers from a large. but sparsely genotyped. mapping population.

Gene tree parsimony (GTP) is a phylogenetic optimization criterion in which a species tree that minimizes the number of gene duplications induced among a set of gene trees is selected. The run time performance of previous implementations has limited its use on large-scale data sets. We used new software that incorporates recent algorithmic advances to examine the performance of GTP on a plant data set consisting of 18.896 gene trees containing 510.922 protein sequences from 136 plant taxa (giving a combined alignment length of >2.9 million characters).

Based on their collinear order along the two chromosomes. the gene pairs were likely duplicated contemporaneously. and therefore comparison of genetic distances among gene pairs provides insights into the distribution of nucleotide substitution rates among plant nuclear genes. Rates of synonymous substitution varied 13.8-fold among the duplicated gene pairs. but 90% of gene pairs differed by less than 2.6-fold. Average nonsynonymous rates were ≈fivefold lower than average synonymous rates; this rate difference is lower than that of previously studied nonplant lineages.

1102656,Gene duplication and evolution,2001,Manyuan Long and Kevin Thornton,293,Science,5535,1551a-1551b,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Lynch and Conery (1) presented one of the first serious efforts to study the evolutionary fate of gene duplication using genomic sequence data. Their analysis led to several interesting observations. particularly with respect to the rate of gene duplication in eukaryotic genomes and the subsequent halflife of duplicates. These two parameters are of particular importance in studying the evolutionary processes of gene duplication and subsequent functional divergence. The most frequent class of duplications appeared to be similar in all six species. which suggests some silencing process for old duplicates. Several additional considerations in the analysis and interpretation. however. might have led to some different conclusions. First. Lynch and Conery (1) used the number of substitutions per silent site. S. to measure the age of a duplicate-gene pair [figure 2 of (1)]. It is unclear. however. that silent divergence is a suitable proxy for a molecular clock involving different genes or gene duplicates. For example. Zeng et al.(2) reported 9-to 15-fold differences in S values and a flat distribution of S for 24 single-copy genes in Drosophila. Two points are important in this context:(i) this large variation in S is expected when the divergence time is low; and (ii) the divergence time for each comparison made by Zeng et al.(2) was fixed. Thus. for different genes. S may vary by more than an order of magnitude given a fixed divergence time. This situation differs from description of divergence time using S values from homologous genes across a group of organisms. in which a dependable molecular clock may exist.

We show. using simulations. that QTL mapping precision for an experimental cross can be increased by the use of a genotypically selected sample of individuals rather than an unselected sample of the same size. Selection is performed using a previously described method that optimizes the complementarity of the crossover sites within the sample. Although the increase in precision is accompanied by a decrease in QTL detection power at markers distant from QTL. only a modest increase in marker density is needed to obtain equivalent power over the whole map. Selected samples also show a slight reduction in the number of false-positive QTL.

1102660,Tracking the evolution of alternatively spliced exons within the Dscam family,2006,Mack E Crayton and Bradford C Powell and Todd J Vision and Morgan C Giddings,6,BMC evolutionary biology,1,1-15,BioMed Central,The Dscam gene in the fruit fly. Drosophila melanogaster. contains twenty-four exons. four of which are composed of tandem arrays that each undergo mutually exclusive alternative splicing (4. 6. 9 and 17). potentially generating 38.016 protein isoforms. This degree of transcript diversity has not been found in mammalian homologs of Dscam. We examined the molecular evolution of exons within this gene family to locate the point of divergence for this alternative splicing pattern. Using the fruit fly Dscam exons 4. 6. 9 and 17 as seed sequences. we iteratively searched sixteen genomes for homologs. and then performed phylogenetic analyses of the resulting sequences to examine their evolutionary history. We found homologs in the nematode. arthropod and vertebrate genomes. including homologs in several vertebrates where Dscam had not been previously annotated. Among these. only the arthropods contain homologs arranged in tandem arrays indicative of mutually exclusive splicing. We found no homologs to these exons within the Arabidopsis. yeast. tunicate or sea urchin genomes but homologs to several constitutive exons from fly Dscam were present within tunicate and sea urchin. Comparing the rate of turnover within the tandem arrays of the insect taxa (fruit fly. mosquito and honeybee). we found the variants within exons 4 and 17 are well conserved in number and spatial arrangement despite 248–283 million years of divergence. In contrast. the variants within exons 6 and 9 have undergone considerable turnover since these taxa diverged. as indicated by deeply branching taxon-specific lineages.

Since its inception in 2005. the CL has undergone multiple rounds of revision and expansion. most notably in its representation of hematopoietic cells. For in vivo cells. the CL focuses on vertebrates but provides general classes that can be used for other metazoans. which can be subtyped in species-specific ontologies. Recent work on the CL has focused on extending the representation of various cell types. and developing new modules in the CL itself. and in related ontologies in coordination with the CL. For example. the Kidney and Urinary Pathway Ontology was used as a template to populate the CL with additional cell types. In addition. subtypes of the class ‘cell in vitro’ have received improved definitions and labels to provide for modularity with the representation of cells in the Cell Line Ontology and Reagent Ontology. Recent changes in the ontology development methodology for CL include a switch from OBO to OWL for the primary encoding of the ontology. and an increasing reliance on logical definitions for improved reasoning. The CL is now mandated as a metadata standard for large functional genomics and transcriptomics projects. and is used extensively for annotation. querying. and analyses of cell type specific data in sequencing consortia such as FANTOM5 and ENCODE. as well as for the NIAID ImmPort database and the Cell Image Library.

The Phenoscape project aims to represent these complex and detailed descriptions with rich and formal semantics that are amenable to computation and integration with phenotype data from other fields of biology. This entails reconceptualizing the traditional free-text characters into the computable Entity-Quality (EQ) formalism using ontologies.  Methodology/Principal Findings We used ontologies and the EQ formalism to curate a collection of 47 phylogenetic studies on ostariophysan fishes (including catfishes. characins. minnows. knifefishes) and their relatives with the goal of integrating these complex phenotype descriptions with information from an existing model organism database (zebrafish. http://zfin.org). We developed a curation workflow for the collection of character. taxonomic and specimen data from these publications. A total of 4.617 phenotypic characters (10.512 states) for 3.449 taxa. primarily species. were curated into EQ formalism (for a total of 12.861 EQ statements) using anatomical and taxonomic terms from teleost-specific ontologies (Teleost Anatomy Ontology and Teleost Taxonomy Ontology) in combination with terms from a quality ontology (Phenotype and Trait Ontology).

Single-species model organism anatomy ontologies (ssAOs) have been established to represent this variation. Multi-species anatomy ontologies (msAOs; vertebrate skeletal. vertebrate homologous. teleost. amphibian AOs) have been developed to represent ‘natural’ phenotypic variation across species. Our aim has been to integrate ssAOs and msAOs for various purposes. including establishing links between phenotypic variation and candidate genes. Previously. msAOs contained a mixture of unique and overlapping content. This hampered integration and coordination due to the need to maintain cross-references or inter-ontology equivalence axioms to the ssAOs. or to perform large-scale obsolescence and modular import.

While these terms are often standardized within specific fields of biology. they can differ dramatically across taxa. Such differences in usage can impair our ability to unambiguously refer to anatomical position when comparing anatomy or phenotypes across species. We developed the Biological Spatial Ontology (BSPO) to standardize the description of spatial and topological relationships across taxa to enable the discovery of comparable phenotypes. BSPO currently contains 146 classes and 58 relations representing anatomical axes. gradients. regions. planes. sides. and surfaces. These concepts can be used at multiple biological scales and in a diversity of taxa. including plants. animals and fungi.

Unfortunately. data that include observations on phenotype and environment are highly heterogeneous and thus difficult to find and integrate. One approach that is likely to improve the status quo involves the use of ontologies to standardize and link data about phenotypes and environments. Specifying and linking data through ontologies will allow researchers to increase the scope and flexibility of large-scale analyses aided by modern computing methods. Investments in this area would advance diverse fields such as ecology. phylogenetics. and conservation biology. While several biological ontologies are well-developed. using them to link phenotypes and environments is rare because of gaps in ontological coverage and limits to interoperability among ontologies and disciplines. In this manuscript. we present (1) use cases from diverse disciplines to illustrate questions that could be answered more efficiently using a robust linkage between phenotypes and environments.

Since its initial publication. we have added new features that address several major bottlenecks in the efficiency of the phenotype curation process: allowing curators during the data curation phase to provisionally request terms that are not yet available from a relevant ontology; supporting quality control against annotation guidelines to reduce later manual review and revision; and enabling the sharing of files for collaboration among curators. We decoupled data annotation from ontology development by creating an Ontology Request Broker (ORB) within Phenex. Curators can use the ORB to request a provisional term for use in data annotation; the provisional term can be automatically replaced with a permanent identifier once the term is added to an ontology. We added a set of annotation consistency checks to prevent common curation errors. reducing the need for later correction. We facilitated collaborative editing by improving the reliability of Phenex when used with online folder sharing services. via file change monitoring and continual autosave.

These include models of process heterogeneity across sites and lineages. as well as alignment-free models and model averaging approaches. Many of these methods should find their way into standard analyses in the near future.

These resources are designed to facilitate accessible and extensible research on hymenopteran phenotypes. Outreach with the hymenopterist community is of utmost importance to the HAO project. and this paper is a direct response to questions that arose from project workshops. In a concerted attempt to surmount barriers of understanding. especially regarding the format. utility. and development of the HAO. we discuss the roles of homology.“preferred terms”. and “structural equivalency”. We also outline the use of Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) and posit that they are a key element necessary for increasing the objectivity and repeatability of science that references hymenopteran anatomy. Pragmatically. we detail a mechanism (the “URI table”) by which authors can use URIs to link their published text to the HAO. and we describe an associated tool (the “Analyzer”) to derive these tables.

Despite many fascinating biological attributes. this group of insects has been overlooked by ecologists and systematists. An imposing obstacle inhibiting research on these wasps is the current state of their chaotic and potentially flawed classification. which has more than 50% of all described species assigned to the genus Evania– a taxon long suspected of being polyphyletic. The generic classification has recently been redefined on the basis of morphological characters. We tested this reinterpreted classification by analysing sequence data from three genes [28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). 16S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I (COI)] under parsimony and Bayesian criteria.

Although wing folding of this type has been described for the hind wing of some insects four-plane wing folding of the fore wing has never been documented. The wing folding mechanism and the pattern of wing folds of Trissevaniini is shared only with some cockroach species (Blattodea). It is an interesting coincidence that all evaniids are predators of cockroach eggs. The major wing fold lines of Trissevaniini likely are not homologous to any known longitudinal anatomical structures on the wings of other Evaniidae. Members of the new tribe share the presence of a coupling mechanism between the fore wing and the mesosoma that is composed of a setal patch on the mesosoma and the retinaculum of the fore wing.

Furthermore. the “helmet” was interpreted to share multiple characteristics with wings. which in extant pterygote insects are present only on the 2nd (T2) and 3rd (T3) thoracic segments. In this context. the “helmet” could be considered an evolutionary novelty. Although multiple lines of morphological evidence putatively supported the “helmet”-wing homology. the relationship of the “helmet” to other thoracic sclerites and muscles remained unclear. Our observations of exemplar thoraces of 10 hemipteran families reveal multiple misinterpretations relevant to the “helmet”-wing homology hypothesis as originally conceived: 1) the “helmet” actually represents T1 (excluding the fore legs); 2) the “T1 tergum” is actually the anterior dorsal area of T2; 3) the putative articulation between the “helmet” and T1 is actually the articulation between T1 and T2. We conclude that there is no dorsal. articulated appendage on the membracid T1. Although the posterior. flattened. cuticular evagination (PFE) of the membracid T1 does share structural and genetic attributes with wings. the PFE is actually widely distributed across Hemiptera. Hence. the presence of this structure in Membracidae is not an evolutionary novelty for this clade.

In the absence of specialized training. often spanning decades. however. these articles can be challenging to decipher. Much of the vocabulary is domain-specific (e.g.. Hymenoptera biology). historically without a comprehensive glossary. and contains much homonymous and synonymous terminology. The Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology was developed to surmount this challenge and to aid future communication related to hymenopteran anatomy. as well as provide support for domain experts so they may actively benefit from the anatomy ontology development. As part of HAO development. an active learning. dictionary-based. natural language recognition tool was implemented to facilitate Hymenoptera anatomy term discovery in literature. We present this tool. referred to as the ‘Proofer’. as part of an iterative approach to growing phenotype-relevant ontologies. regardless of domain.

1102714,The evolutionary significance of cis-regulatory mutations,2007,Gregory A Wray,8,,3,206-216,Nature Publishing Group,For decades. evolutionary biologists have argued that changes in cis-regulatory sequences constitute an important part of the genetic basis for adaptation. Although originally based on first principles. this claim is now empirically well supported: numerous studies have identified cis-regulatory mutations with functionally significant consequences for morphology. physiology and behaviour. The focus has now shifted to considering whether cis-regulatory and coding mutations make qualitatively different contributions to phenotypic evolution. Cases in which parallel mutations have produced parallel trait modifications in particular suggest that some phenotypic changes are more likely to result from cis-regulatory mutations than from coding mutations.,True,ktyhG_oAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1457,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2063,7798840804863607419,/scholar?cites=7798840804863607419,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.363.5719&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Seven independent data sets suggest that invertebrates diverged from chordates about a billion years ago. about twice as long ago as the Cambrian.

We found that positive natural selection altered the cis-regulation of human prodynorphin. the precursor molecule for a suite of endogenous opioids and neuropeptides with critical roles in regulating perception. behavior. and memory. Independent lines of phylogenetic and population genetic evidence support a history of selective sweeps driving the evolution of the human prodynorphin promoter. In experimental assays of chimpanzee–human hybrid promoters. the selected sequence increases transcriptional inducibility. The evidence for a change in the response of the brain's natural opioids to inductive stimuli points to potential human-specific characteristics favored during evolution. In addition. the pattern of linked nucleotide and microsatellite variation among and within modern human populations suggests that recent selection. subsequent to the fixation of the human-specific mutations and the peopling of the globe. has favored different prodynorphin cis-regulatory alleles in different parts of the world.,True,ktyhG_oAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,223,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030387,5029199055818090561,/scholar?cites=5029199055818090561,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030387,0,0,0

Previous attempts to resolve the phylogeny of lemurs employed limited mitochondrial or small nuclear data sets. with many relationships poorly supported or entirely unresolved. We used genomic resources to develop 11 novel markers from nine chromosomes. representing ∼9 kb of nuclear sequence data. In combination with previously published nuclear and mitochondrial loci. this yields a data set of more than 16 kb and adds ∼275 kb of DNA sequence to current databases.

1102732,Parallel evolution of nonfeeding larvae in echinoids,1996,Gregory A Wray,45,,3,308-322,Society of Systematic Biologists,The switch from feeding to nonfeeding larvae is an ecologically important transformation that has evolved on several separate occasions within the echinoids. In each case. this life history transformation has been accompanied by extensive changes in larval morphology. A phylogenetic approach is used here to reconstruct these morphological changes. to begin asking why they have taken the particular forms observed. and to assess the degree of parallel transformation in separate cases. Both traditional character mapping and a less usual aggregate analysis indicate massively parallel transformations in larval morphology associated with. and only with. this particular life history transformation. Some of these parallel morphological transformations may be due to relaxed functional constraints associated with the ancestral life history mode. but many are probably the result of new functional constraints …,True,ktyhG_oAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,170,https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/45/3/308/1616247,14617714257710569888,/scholar?cites=14617714257710569888,,https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-pdf/45/3/308/19501728/45-3-308.pdf,0,0,0

Microbiomes vary greatly from individual to individual. Understanding the factors that account for this variation. however. has proven challenging. with many studies able to account statistically for just a small proportion of the inter-individual variation in the abundance. species richness or composition of bacteria. The human armpit has long been noted to host a high biomass bacterial community. and recent studies have highlighted substantial inter-individual variation in armpit bacteria. even relative to variation among individuals for other body habitats. One obvious potential explanation for this variation has to do with the use of personal hygiene products. particularly deodorants and antiperspirants. Here we experimentally manipulate product use to examine the abundance. species richness. and composition of bacterial communities that recolonize the armpits of people with different product use habits. In doing so. we find that when deodorant and antiperspirant use were stopped. culturable bacterial density increased and approached that found on individuals who regularly do not use any product.

It is mostly due to the high mutation rate of the mtDNA and limited repair mechanisms present in the mitochondrion. Motivated by mitochondrial diseases. much focus has been placed into studying this phenomenon in human samples and in medical contexts. To place these results in an evolutionary context and to explore general principles of heteroplasmy. we describe an integrated cross-species evaluation of heteroplasmy in mammals that exploits previously reported NGS data. Focusing on ChIP-seq experiments. we developed a novel approach to detect heteroplasmy from the concomitant mitochondrial DNA fraction sequenced in these experiments. We first demonstrate that the sequencing coverage of mtDNA in ChIP-seq experiments is sufficient for heteroplasmy detection. We then describe a novel detection method for accurate detection of heteroplasmies. which also accounts for the error rate of NGS technology. Applying this method to 79 individuals from 16 species resulted in 107 heteroplasmic positions present in a total of 45 individuals. Further analysis revealed that the majority of detected heteroplasmies occur in intergenic regions. In addition to documenting the prevalence of mtDNA in ChIP-seq data. the results of our mitochondrial heteroplasmy detection method suggest that mitochondrial heteroplasmies identified across vertebrates share similar characteristics as found for human heteroplasmies.

Although various biological processes may cause different genes to have different genealogical histories (and hence different tree topologies). we also may expect that the number of distinct topologies among a set of genes is relatively small compared with the number of possible topologies. Therefore evidence about the tree topology for one gene should influence our inferences of the tree topology on a different gene. but to what extent? In this paper. we present a new approach for modeling and estimating concordance among a set of gene trees given aligned molecular sequence data.

Maximization of the number of taxa sampled is the strategy favored by most phylogeneticists. although its necessity remains the subject of debate. Vast increases in gene number are now possible due to advances in genomics. but large numbers of genes will be available for only modest numbers of taxa. raising the question of whether such genome-scale phylogenies will be robust to the addition of taxa.

The relatively high expression levels of chemosensory genes in the female antennae reveal its role as an organ predominately assigned to chemosensation. Remarkably. the expression of these genes was highly conserved in the male antennae. but at much lower relative levels. Alternatively. consistent with a role in mating. the male antennae displayed significant enhancement of genes involved in audition. while the female enhancement of these genes was observed. but to a lesser degree. These findings suggest that the chemoreceptive spectrum. as defined by gene expression profiles. is largely similar in female and male An. gambiae.

1102790,Phylogenetic and transcriptomic analysis of chemosensory receptors in a pair of divergent ant species reveals sex-specific signatures of odor coding,2012,Xiaofan Zhou and Jesse D Slone and Antonis Rokas and Shelley L Berger and Jürgen Liebig and Anandasankar Ray and Danny Reinberg and Laurence J Zwiebel,8,PLoS Genet,8,e1002930,Public Library of Science,Ants are a highly successful family of insects that thrive in a variety of habitats across the world. Perhaps their best-known features are complex social organization and strict division of labor. separating reproduction from the day-to-day maintenance and care of the colony. as well as strict discrimination against foreign individuals. Since these social characteristics in ants are thought to be mediated by semiochemicals. a thorough analysis of these signals. and the receptors that detect them. is critical in revealing mechanisms that lead to stereotypic behaviors. To address these questions. we have defined and characterized the major chemoreceptor families in a pair of behaviorally and evolutionarily distinct ant species. Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator. Through comprehensive re-annotation. we show that these ant species harbor some of the largest yet known repertoires of odorant receptors (Ors) among insects. as well as a more modest number of gustatory receptors (Grs) and variant ionotropic glutamate receptors (Irs). Our phylogenetic analyses further demonstrate remarkably rapid gains and losses of ant Ors. while Grs and Irs have also experienced birth-and-death evolution to different degrees. In addition. comparisons of antennal transcriptomes between sexes identify many chemoreceptors that are differentially expressed between males and females and between species. We have also revealed an agonist for a worker-enriched OR from C. floridanus. representing the first case of a heterologously characterized ant tuning Or.

In this study. we used comparative genome hybridization analysis to evaluate the genome composition of different S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii natural hybrids isolated from wine and beer fermentations to infer their evolutionary origins and to figure out the potential role of common S. kudriavzevii gene fraction present in these hybrids.

Unlike ale-style beers. which are generally brewed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. lagers are brewed at colder temperatures with allopolyploid hybrids of Saccharomyces eubayanus x S. cerevisiae. Since the discovery of S. eubayanus in 2011. additional strains have been isolated from South America. North America. Australasia. and Asia. but only interspecies hybrids have been isolated in Europe. Here. using genome sequence data. we examine the relationships of these wild S. eubayanus strains to each other and to domesticated lager strains. Our results support the existence of a relatively low-diversity (π = 0.00197) lineage of S. eubayanus whose distribution stretches across the Holarctic ecozone and includes wild isolates from Tibet. new wild isolates from North America. and the S. eubayanus parents of lager yeasts.

A second diverse South American population (π = 0.00354) and two early-diverging Asian subspecies are more distantly related. We further show that no single wild strain from the Holarctic lineage is the sole closest relative of lager yeasts.

These mechanisms have probably been involved in the origin of novel yeast genotypes and phenotypes. which in due course were to colonize and predominate in the new fermentative environments created by human manipulation. The particular conditions in which hybrids arose are still unknown. as well as the number of possible hybridization events that generated the whole set of natural hybrids described in the literature during recent years. In this study. we could infer at least six different hybridization events that originated a set of 26 S. cerevisiae x S. kudriavzevii hybrids isolated from both fermentative and non-fermentative environments. Different wine S. cerevisiae strains and European S. kudriavzevii strains were probably involved in the hybridization events according to gene sequence information. as well as from previous data on their genome composition and ploidy.

Hygrophobic aerial conidia have been described for several species of Ustilaginales. such as Ustilago hypodytes (Schlecht.) Fr. and Sorosporium saponariae Rudolphi (13). While we try to avoid introducing separate anamorph binomials for holomorphic species. the species listed above seem to lack a perfect state or it is presently unknown. As species of smuts can be identified only on teleomorphic characteristics. such as host range. morphology of soni and teliospores (19. 22). it is difficult to compare the anamorphic species listed above with known species of smuts. Therefore comparative morphological. physiological. biochemical and molecular investigations of anamorphs of smuts will be useful. However. because several hundreds of species of smuts are involved. this task is not easily performed. A second possibility is to compare ribosomal DNA sequences in order to establish their phylogenetic position. Partial nucleotide sequences of the 26S ribosomal DNA of these anamorph species clearly place them in the same group together with U. maydis (Fig. 1)(5. 8).

We investigated the occurrence and diversity of yeasts in two localities of the IPB: São Domingos (Portugal) and Rio Tinto (Spain). Yeast isolation was performed on conventional culture media (MYP). acidified (pH 3) media (MYP3). and on media prepared with water from the study sites (MYPw). The main goal of the study was to determine the structure of the yeast community; a combination of molecular methods was used for accurate species identifications. Our results showed that the largest fraction of the yeast community was recovered on MYPw rather than on MYP and MYP3.

We recently found sympatric pairs of Saccharomyces species. composed of one cryotolerant and one thermotolerant species in oak bark samples of various geographic origins. In order to contribute to explain the occurrence in sympatry of Saccharomyces species. we screened Saccharomyces genomic data for protein divergence that might be correlated to distinct growth temperature preferences of the species. using the dN/dS ratio as a measure of protein evolution rates and pair-wise species comparisons. In addition to proteins previously implicated in growth at suboptimal temperatures. we found that glycolytic enzymes were among the proteins exhibiting higher than expected divergence when one cryotolerant and one thermotolerant species are compared. By measuring glycolytic fluxes and glycolytic enzymatic activities in different species and at different temperatures. we subsequently show that the unusual divergence of glycolytic genes may be related to divergent evolution of the glycolytic pathway aligning its performance to the growth temperature profiles of the different species. In general. our results support the view that growth temperature preference is a trait that may have undergone divergent selection in the course of ecological speciation in Saccharomyces.,True,FR1LrqIAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,78,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020739,1780150201564075485,/scholar?cites=1780150201564075485,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020739,0,0,0

Whereas in the reports of KÜTZING (1833) and VON WETTSTEIN (1885) their nature was not completely elucidated. BREFELD (1881. 1888. 1895a. 1895b) and MÖLLER (1895) made detailed studies of basidiospore germination in jelly fungi and smuts. Brefeld was the first author to draw attention to the presence or absence of a yeast stage and to use this trait as an aid in classification. Except for Möller. who followed Brefeld’s views. the concept that the yeast stage could be a meaningful character for taxonomy was. for the most part. neglected in the following decades. Other advances in basidiomyceteous yeast taxonomy were made by KLUYVER & VAN NIEL (1924. 1927) who noted that the ballistoconidia of the asexual genus Sporobolomyces resembled the ejected basidiospores of mushroom-producing basidiomycetes. Some years later. NYLAND (1949) described the genus Sporidiobolus for a fungus able to produce yeast cells but exhibiting various basidiomycete traits. namely ballistospore mode of production of conidia (ballistoconidia). clamp connections. and smut-like teliospores. The affiliation of certain yeasts with the basidiomycetes entered a new era when BANNO (1963. 1967) mated strains of the asexual species Rhodotorula glutinis (Fresenius) Harrison and obtained a teleomorph. which was named Rhodosporidium. with clamped mycelium and teliospores that produced phragmobasidia with sessile basidiospores.

Physiological data obtained for a particularly fast-growing distiller9s strain (PYCC 5297) showed that. in contrast to what has been previously reported for other strains. maltotriose is essentially fermented. The respiratory quotient was. however. considerably higher for maltotriose (0.36) than for maltose (0.16) or glucose (0.11). To assess the role of transport in the sequential utilization of maltose and maltotriose. we investigated the presence of genes involved in maltotriose uptake in the type strain of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis (PYCC 4457).

1102882,Evidence for divergent evolution of growth temperature preference in sympatric Saccharomyces species,2011,Paula Gonçalves and Elisabete Valério and Cláudia Correia and João MGCF de Almeida and José Paulo Sampaio,6,PloS one,6,e20739,Public Library of Science,The genus Saccharomyces currently includes eight species in addition to the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. most of which can be consistently isolated from tree bark and soil. We recently found sympatric pairs of Saccharomyces species. composed of one cryotolerant and one thermotolerant species in oak bark samples of various geographic origins. In order to contribute to explain the occurrence in sympatry of Saccharomyces species. we screened Saccharomyces genomic data for protein divergence that might be correlated to distinct growth temperature preferences of the species. using the dN/dS ratio as a measure of protein evolution rates and pair-wise species comparisons. In addition to proteins previously implicated in growth at suboptimal temperatures. we found that glycolytic enzymes were among the proteins exhibiting higher than expected divergence when one cryotolerant and one thermotolerant species are compared. By measuring glycolytic fluxes and glycolytic enzymatic activities in different species and at different temperatures. we subsequently show that the unusual divergence of glycolytic genes may be related to divergent evolution of the glycolytic pathway aligning its performance to the growth temperature profiles of the different species. In general. our results support the view that growth temperature preference is a trait that may have undergone divergent selection in the course of ecological speciation in Saccharomyces.,True,FHToK58AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,78,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020739,1780150201564075485,/scholar?cites=1780150201564075485,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020739,0,0,0

1102886,A deviation from the bipolar-tetrapolar mating paradigm in an early diverged basidiomycete,2010,Marco A Coelho and José Paulo Sampaio and Paula Gonçalves,6,PLoS Genet,8,e1001052,Public Library of Science,In fungi. sexual identity is determined by specialized genomic regions called MAT loci which are the equivalent to sex chromosomes in some animals and plants. Usually. only two sexes or mating types exist. which are determined by two alternate sets of genes (or alleles) at the MAT locus (bipolar system). However. in the phylum Basidiomycota. a unique tetrapolar system emerged in which four different mating types are generated per meiosis. This occurs because two functionally distinct molecular recognition systems. each encoded by one MAT region. constrain the selection of sexual partners. Heterozygosity at both MAT regions is a pre-requisite for mating in both bipolar and tetrapolar basidiomycetes. Tetrapolar mating behaviour results from the absence of genetic linkage between the two regions bringing forth up to thousands of mating types. The subphylum Pucciniomycotina. an early diverged lineage of basidiomycetes encompassing important plant pathogens such as the rusts and saprobes like Rhodosporidium and Sporidiobolus. has been so far poorly explored concerning the content and organization of MAT loci. Here we show that the red yeast Sporidiobolus salmonicolor has a mating system unlike any previously described because occasional disruptions of the genetic cohesion of the bipolar MAT locus originate new mating types. We confirmed that mating is normally bipolar and that heterozygosity at both MAT regions is required for mating. However. a laboratory cross showed that meiotic recombination may occur within the bipolar MAT locus. explaining tetrapolar features like increased allele number and evolution rates of some …,True,FHToK58AAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,58,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001052,15223841986482651891,/scholar?cites=15223841986482651891,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001052,0,0,0

In this study. a gene encoding a fructose-specific transporter was characterized. The strategy involved the functional complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that does not take up hexoses (hxt-null strain). This strain was transformed with a genomic library of Z. bailii. One transformant capable of growing on fructose. but not on glucose. was obtained. This transformant did not transport d-[14C]glucose. and the kinetic parameters for d-[14C]fructose were V max=3·3 mmol h−1 g−1 and K m=80·4 mM.

In the present work. we studied the phylogenetic distribution and pattern of inheritance of a fungal gene encoding a fructose transporter (FSY1) with unique substrate selectivity. 109 FSY1 homologues were identified in two sub-phyla of the Ascomycota. in a survey that included 241 available fungal genomes. At least 10 independent inter-species instances of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) involving FSY1 were identified. supported by strong phylogenetic evidence and synteny analyses. The acquisition of FSY1 through HGT was sometimes suggestive of xenolog gene displacement. but several cases of pseudoparalogy were also uncovered. Moreover. evidence was found for successive HGT events. possibly including those responsible for transmission of the gene among yeast lineages. These occurrences do not seem to be driven by functional diversification of the Fsy1 proteins because Fsy1 homologues from widely distant lineages. including at least one acquired by HGT. appear to have similar biochemical properties. In summary. retracing the evolutionary path of the FSY1 gene brought to light an unparalleled number of independent HGT events involving a single fungal gene. We propose that the turbulent evolutionary history of the gene may be linked to the unique biochemical properties of the encoded transporter. whose predictable effect on fitness may be highly variable.

To address this. we assayed fitness at many levels of up- and down-regulated expression of a single essential gene. LCB2. involved in sphingolipid synthesis in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Reduced LCB2 expression rapidly decreases cellular fitness. yet increased expression has little effect. The wild-type expression level is therefore perched on the edge of a nonlinear fitness cliff. LCB2 is upregulated when cells are exposed to osmotic stress; consistent with this. the entire fitness curve is shifted upward to higher expression under osmotic stress. illustrating the selective force behind gene regulation.

Compared to other budding yeasts in the subphylum Saccharomycotina. we noticed that a lineage in the genus Hanseniaspora exhibited very high evolutionary rates. low Guanine–Cytosine (GC) content. small genome sizes. and lower gene numbers. To better understand Hanseniaspora evolution. we analyzed 25 genomes. including 11 newly sequenced. representing 18/21 known species in the genus. Our phylogenomic analyses identify two Hanseniaspora lineages. a faster-evolving lineage (FEL). which began diversifying approximately 87 million years ago (mya). and a slower-evolving lineage (SEL). which began diversifying approximately 54 mya. Remarkably. both lineages lost genes associated with the cell cycle and genome integrity. but these losses were greater in the FEL. E.g.. all species lost the cell-cycle regulator WHIskey 5 (WHI5). and the FEL lost components of the spindle checkpoint pathway (e.g.. Mitotic Arrest-Deficient 1 [MAD1]. Mitotic Arrest-Deficient 2 [MAD2]) and DNA-damage–checkpoint pathway (e.g.. Mitosis Entry Checkpoint 3 [MEC3]. RADiation sensitive 9 [RAD9]).

All three changes were reassignments of the codon CUG. which is translated as serine (in 2 yeast clades). alanine (1 clade). or the ‘universal’leucine (2 clades). The newly discovered Ser2 clade is in the final stages of a genetic code transition. Most species in this clade have genes for both a novel tRNA Ser (CAG) and an ancestral tRNA Leu (CAG) to read CUG. but only tRNA Ser (CAG) is used in standard growth conditions. The coexistence of these alloacceptor tRNA genes indicates that the genetic code transition occurred via an ambiguous translation phase. We propose that the three parallel reassignments of CUG were not driven by natural selection in favor of their effects on the proteome. but by selection to eliminate the ancestral tRNA Leu (CAG).,True,TbhiPiQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,29,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04374-7,8662624836302508197,/scholar?cites=8662624836302508197,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04374-7,0,0,0

Here. we show that in a yeast lineage (the Wickerhamiella/Starmerella. W/S clade) comprised of fructophilic species thriving in the high-sugar floral niche. the acquisition of fructophily is concurrent with a wider remodeling of central carbon metabolism. Coupling comparative genomics with biochemical and genetic approaches. we gathered ample evidence for the loss of alcoholic fermentation in an ancestor of the W/S clade and subsequent reinstatement through either horizontal acquisition of homologous bacterial genes or modification of a pre-existing yeast gene. An enzyme required for sucrose assimilation was also acquired from bacteria. suggesting that the genetic novelties identified in the W/S clade may be related to adaptation to the high-sugar environment.

Individual traits may co-evolve with one other. and these correlations can be driven by factors intrinsic or extrinsic to an organism. However. few studies. especially in microbes. have simultaneously investigated both across a broad taxonomic range. Here we quantify pairwise associations among 48 traits across 784 diverse yeast species of the ancient budding yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina. assessing the effects of phylogenetic history. genetics. and ecology. We find extensive negative (traits that tend to not occur together) and positive (traits that tend to co-occur) pairwise associations among traits. as well as between traits and environments. These associations can largely be explained by the biological properties of the traits. such as overlapping biochemical pathways. The isolation environments of the yeasts explain a minor but significant component of the variance. while phylogeny (the retention of ancestral traits in descendant species) plays an even more limited role. Positive correlations are pervasive among carbon utilization traits and track with chemical structures (e.g.. glucosides and sugar alcohols) and metabolic pathways. suggesting a molecular basis for the presence of suites of traits. In several cases. characterized genes from model organisms suggest that enzyme promiscuity and overlapping biochemical pathways are likely mechanisms to explain these macroevolutionary trends.

It is now well understood that variation in synonymous codon usage is influenced by mutational bias coupled with both natural selection for translational efficiency and genetic drift. but how these processes shape patterns of codon usage bias across entire lineages remains unexplored. To address this question. we used a rich genomic data set of 327 species that covers nearly one third of the known biodiversity of the budding yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina. We found that. while genome-wide relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for all codons was highly correlated with the GC content of the third codon position (GC3). the usage of codons for the amino acids proline. arginine. and glycine was inconsistent with the neutral expectation where mutational bias coupled with genetic drift drive codon usage. Examination between genes’ effective numbers of codons and their GC3 contents in individual genomes revealed that nearly a quarter of genes (381.174/1.683.203; 23%). as well as most genomes (308/327; 94%). significantly deviate from the neutral expectation. Finally. by evaluating the imprint of translational selection on codon usage. measured as the degree to which genes’ adaptiveness to the tRNA pool were correlated with selective pressure. we show that translational selection is widespread in budding yeast genomes (264/327; 81%).

However. the extent to which network pleiotropy versus environmental coevolution shapes shared responses has not been addressed. To test these alternatives. we took advantage of the fact that the genus Saccharomyces has variation in habitat usage and diversity in the carbon sources that a given strain can metabolize. We examined patterns of gain and loss in carbon utilization traits across 488 strains of Saccharomyces to investigate whether the structure of metabolic pathways or selection pressure from common environments may have caused carbon utilization traits to be gained and lost together. While most carbon sources were gained and lost independently of each other. we found four clusters that exhibit non-random patterns of gain and loss across strains. Contrary to the network pleiotropy hypothesis. we did not find that these patterns are explained by the structure of metabolic pathways or shared enzymes.

While phenotypic reversals to ancestral states have been observed. little is known about their underlying genetic causes. The genomes of budding yeasts have been shaped by extensive reductive evolution. such as reduced genome sizes and the losses of metabolic capabilities. However. the extent and mechanisms of trait reacquisition after gene loss in yeasts have not been thoroughly studied. Here. through phylogenomic analyses. we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the yeast galactose utilization pathway and observed widespread and repeated losses of the ability to utilize galactose. which occurred concurrently with the losses of GALactose (GAL) utilization genes. Unexpectedly. we detected multiple galactose-utilizing lineages that were deeply embedded within clades that …,True,TbhiPiQAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,2,https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/217/2/iyaa012/6007471,15012072537290290791,/scholar?cites=15012072537290290791,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/07/24/2020.07.22.216101.full.pdf,0,0,0
1102916,Signatures of optimal codon usage predict metabolic ecology in budding yeasts,2020,Abigail L LaBella and Dana Opulente and Jacob L Steenwyk and Chris Todd Hittinger and Antonis Rokas,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Reverse ecology is the inference of ecological information from patterns of genomic variation. One rich. heretofore underutilized. source of ecologically-relevant genomic information is codon optimality or adaptation. Bias toward codons that match the tRNA pool is robustly associated with high gene expression in diverse organisms. suggesting that codon optimization could be used in a reverse ecology framework to identify highly expressed. ecologically relevant genes. To test this hypothesis. we examined the relationship between optimal codon usage in the classic galactose metabolism (GAL) pathway and known ecological niches for 329 species of budding yeasts. a diverse subphylum of fungi. We find that optimal codon usage in the GAL pathway is positively correlated with quantitative growth on galactose. suggesting that GAL codon optimization reflects increased capacity to grow on galactose. Optimal codon usage in the GAL pathway is also positively correlated with human-associated ecological niches in yeasts of the CUG-Ser1 clade and with dairy-associated ecological niches in the family Saccharomycetaceae. For example. optimal codon usage of GAL genes is greater than 85% of all genes in the major human pathogen Candida albicans (CUG-Ser1 clade) and greater than 75% of genes in the dairy yeast Kluyveromyces lactis (family Saccharomycetaceae). We further find a correlation between optimization in the thiamine biosynthesis and GAL pathways. As a result. optimal codon usage in thiamine biosynthesis genes is also associated with dairy ecological niches in Saccharomycetaceae. which may reflect competition with co …,True,TbhiPiQAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.214635v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/07/24/2020.07.22.214635.full.pdf,0,0,0

Therefore. identifying de novo genes and understanding how the transition from noncoding to coding occurs are key problems in evolutionary biology. However. identifying de novo genes is a difficult task. hampered by the presence of remote homologs. fast evolving sequences and erroneously annotated protein coding genes. To overcome these limitations. we developed a procedure that handles the usual pitfalls in de novo gene identification and predicted the emergence of 703 de novo genes in 15 yeast species from two genera whose phylogeny spans at least 100 million years of evolution.

One issue with studying these phenomena is the tractability of large scale experiments. The goal of this dissertation is to use a set of wild and industrial strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to explore the genotypic and phenotypic variation in carbon metabolism. I first used publicly available data to measure variation in carbon metabolism traits. the ability to use a carbon source. across the genus Saccharomyces. Additionally. I assessed whether these traits displayed patterns of coordinated gain and loss and what factors were driving these patterns. Next. I used of wild and industrial strains of S. cerevisiae to quantify variation in growth rates among carbon metabolism traits across single carbon environments and multi-dimensional conditions. The use of wild and industrial strains and the use of multi-dimensional conditions provided a level of environmental complexity that cannot be achieved with laboratory strains under single condition perturbations. These data. along with genomic data provided insight into how genotypic variation is translated into phenotypic variation. My results demonstrated significant variation for carbon metabolism among strains and strong non-additive growth rate interactions among multi-dimensional conditions. Furthermore. I found associations between growth rate and gene presence and copy number variation. The niche breadth demonstrated by these strains provided the opportunity to further our understanding of mutational robustness. the ability to maintain function in the …,True,TbhiPiQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://ir.stonybrook.edu/xmlui/handle/11401/77391,,,,https://ir.stonybrook.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11401/77391/Opulente_grad.sunysb_0771E_12336.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Here. we use long-term experimental evolution of isogenic yeast populations of different initial ploidy to study adaptation to increasing levels of ethanol. Whole-genome sequencing of more than 30 evolved populations and over 100 adapted clones isolated throughout this two-year evolution experiment revealed how a complex interplay of de novo single nucleotide mutations. copy number variation. ploidy changes. mutator phenotypes. and clonal interference led to a significant increase in ethanol tolerance. Although the specific mutations differ between different evolved lineages. application of a novel computational pipeline. PheNetic. revealed that many mutations target functional modules involved in stress response. cell cycle regulation. DNA repair and respiration. Measuring the fitness effects of selected mutations introduced in non-evolved ethanol-sensitive cells revealed several adaptive mutations that had previously not been implicated in ethanol tolerance. including mutations in PRT1. VPS70 and MEX67. Interestingly. variation in VPS70 was recently identified as a QTL for ethanol tolerance in an industrial bio-ethanol strain.

All three changes were reassignments of the codon CUG. which is translated as serine (in 2 yeast clades). alanine (1 clade). or the ‘universal’leucine (2 clades). The newly discovered Ser2 clade is in the final stages of a genetic code transition. Most species in this clade have genes for both a novel tRNA Ser (CAG) and an ancestral tRNA Leu (CAG) to read CUG. but only tRNA Ser (CAG) is used in standard growth conditions. The coexistence of these alloacceptor tRNA genes indicates that the genetic code transition occurred via an ambiguous translation phase. We propose that the three parallel reassignments of CUG were not driven by natural selection in favor of their effects on the proteome. but by selection to eliminate the ancestral tRNA Leu (CAG).,True,6oVFVdMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,29,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04374-7,8662624836302508197,/scholar?cites=8662624836302508197,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04374-7,0,0,0

Coupling comparative genomics with biochemical and genetic approaches. we gathered ample evidence for the loss of alcoholic fermentation in an ancestor of the W/S clade and subsequent reinstatement through either horizontal acquisition of homologous bacterial genes or modification of a pre-existing yeast gene. An enzyme required for sucrose assimilation was also acquired from bacteria. suggesting that the genetic novelties identified in the W/S clade may be related to adaptation to the high-sugar environment.

Among sexual yeasts. heterothallic species are those in which haploid strains fall into two distinct and stable mating types (MATa and MATα). whereas homothallic species are those that can switch mating types or that appear not to have distinct mating types [1. 2]. The evolutionary history of these mating compatibility systems is uncertain. particularly regarding the number and direction of transitions between homothallism and heterothallism. and regarding whether the process of mating-type switching had a single origin [3. 4. 5].

Morphological traits are thought to evolve frequently through cis-regulatory changes because these mechanisms bypass constraints in pleiotropic genes that are reused during development. In contrast. the constraints acting on metabolic traits during evolution are less well studied. Here we show how a metabolic bottleneck gene has repeatedly adopted similar cis-regulatory solutions during evolution. likely due to its pleiotropic role integrating flux from multiple metabolic pathways. Specifically. the genes encoding phosphoglucomutase activity (PGM1/PGM2). which connect GALactose catabolism to glycolysis. have gained and lost direct regulation by the transcription factor Gal4 several times during yeast evolution.

Using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae UBI4 gene. we show that this multi-unit structure allows cells to rapidly produce large amounts of ubiquitin needed to respond to sudden stress. The number of ubiquitin units encoded by UBI4 influences cellular survival and the rate of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-mediated proteolysis following heat stress.

Specifically. we find that ethanol slows down replication and affects localization of Mrc1. a conserved protein that helps stabilize the replisome. In addition. ethanol exposure also results in the recruitment of error-prone DNA polymerases to the replication fork. Interestingly. preventing this recruitment through mutagenesis of the PCNA/Pol30 polymerase clamp or deleting specific error-prone polymerases abolishes the mutagenic effect of ethanol.

The new NPCL toolkit has three important advantages compared with all previously developed NPCL sets: 1) the kit is universally applicable across vertebrates. with a PCR success rate of 94.6% in 16 widely divergent tested vertebrate species; 2) more than 90% of PCR reactions produce strong and single bands of the expected sizes that can be directly sequenced …,True,aNqPBsEAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,71,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/30/10/2235/1243256,12484701405028695243,/scholar?cites=12484701405028695243,,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/30/10/2235/1243256,0,0,0

To resolve this controversy. we assembled a data set comprising 1.290 nuclear genes encoding 690.838 amino acid residues by analyzing available genome and transcriptome data. Phylogenetic analyses of this data set provided overwhelming evidence that the lungfishes are the closest living relatives of the land vertebrates.

To better understand Hanseniaspora evolution. we analyzed 25 genomes. including 11 newly sequenced. representing 18/21 known species in the genus. Our phylogenomic analyses identify two Hanseniaspora lineages. a faster-evolving lineage (FEL). which began diversifying approximately 87 million years ago (mya). and a slower-evolving lineage (SEL). which began diversifying approximately 54 mya. Remarkably. both lineages lost genes associated with the cell cycle and genome integrity. but these losses were greater in the FEL. E.g.. all species lost the cell-cycle regulator WHIskey 5 (WHI5). and the FEL lost components of the spindle checkpoint pathway (e.g.. Mitotic Arrest-Deficient 1 [MAD1].

For example. RAG1. a representative NPCL marker. has been successfully used to make phylogenetic inferences within all major osteichthyan groups. However. such markers with broad working range and high phylogenetic performance are still scarce. It is necessary to develop more universal NPCL markers comparable to RAG1 for osteichthyan phylogenetics.   Methodology/Principal Findings We developed three long universal NPCL markers (>1.6 kb each) based on single-copy nuclear genes (KIAA1239. SACS and TTN) that possess large exons and exhibit the appropriate evolutionary rates. We then compared their phylogenetic utilities with that of the reference marker RAG1 in 47 jawed vertebrate species. In comparison with RAG1. each of the three long universal markers yielded similar topologies and branch supports. all in congruence with the currently accepted osteichthyan phylogeny. To compare their phylogenetic performance visually. we also estimated the phylogenetic informativeness (PI) profile for each of the four long universal NPCL markers. The PI curves indicated that SACS performed best over the whole timescale. while RAG1. KIAA1239 and TTN exhibited similar phylogenetic performances. In addition. we compared the success of nested PCR and standard PCR when amplifying NPCL marker fragments.

All three changes were reassignments of the codon CUG. which is translated as serine (in 2 yeast clades). alanine (1 clade). or the ‘universal’leucine (2 clades). The newly discovered Ser2 clade is in the final stages of a genetic code transition. Most species in this clade have genes for both a novel tRNA Ser (CAG) and an ancestral tRNA Leu (CAG) to read CUG. but only tRNA Ser (CAG) is used in standard growth conditions. The coexistence of these alloacceptor tRNA genes indicates that the genetic code transition occurred via an ambiguous translation phase. We propose that the three parallel reassignments of CUG were not driven by natural selection in favor of their effects on the proteome. but by selection to eliminate the ancestral tRNA Leu (CAG).,True,aNqPBsEAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,29,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04374-7,8662624836302508197,/scholar?cites=8662624836302508197,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04374-7,0,0,0

Coupling comparative genomics with biochemical and genetic approaches. we gathered ample evidence for the loss of alcoholic fermentation in an ancestor of the W/S clade and subsequent reinstatement through either horizontal acquisition of homologous bacterial genes or modification of a pre-existing yeast gene. An enzyme required for sucrose assimilation was also acquired from bacteria. suggesting that the genetic novelties identified in the W/S clade may be related to adaptation to the high-sugar environment.

Thus. several different trimming strategies have been developed for identifying and removing these sites prior to phylogenetic inference. However. a recent study reported that doing so can worsen inference. underscoring the need for alternative alignment trimming strategies. Here. we introduce ClipKIT. an alignment trimming software that. rather than identifying and removing putatively phylogenetically uninformative sites. instead aims to identify and retain parsimony-informative sites. which are known to be phylogenetically informative. To test the efficacy of ClipKIT. we examined the accuracy and support of phylogenies inferred from 14 different alignment trimming strategies. including those implemented in ClipKIT. across nearly 140.000 alignments from a broad sampling of evolutionary histories. Phylogenies inferred from ClipKIT-trimmed alignments are accurate. robust. and time saving. Furthermore. ClipKIT consistently outperformed other trimming methods across diverse datasets. suggesting that strategies based on identifying and retaining parsimony-informative sites provide a robust framework for alignment trimming.,True,aNqPBsEAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,3,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001007,11665884756667589709,/scholar?cites=11665884756667589709,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001007,0,0,0

Many yeasts occur widely. whereas some appear to be confined to specific habitats. Yeasts seldom occur in the absence of either molds or bacteria. Consequently. selective techniques are often used for recovery of yeasts. employing media that permit the yeasts to grow. while suppressing molds and bacteria. Under the morphological characterization of yeasts there are several factors that include: texture. color. surface. elevation. and margin. In texture. mucoid growth is frequently associated with encapsulation of cells from production of extracellular polysaccharides; membranous growth generally results from profuse formation of hyphae or pseudohyphae.

1102988,Molecular taxonomy of the yeasts,1994,Cletus P Kurtzman,10,,13,1727-1740,John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,The term ‘yeast’ is often taken as a synonym for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. but the phylogenetic diversity of yeasts is illustrated by their assignment to two taxonomic classes of fungi. the ascomycetes and the basidiomycetes. Subdivision of taxa within their respective classes is usually made from comparisons of morphological and physiological features whose genetic basis is often unknown. Application of molecular comparisons to questions in yeast classification offers an unprecedented opportunity to re‐evaluate current taxonomic schemes from the perspective of quantitative genetic differences. This review examines the impact of molecular comparisons. notably rRNA/rDNA sequence divergence. on the current phenotypically defined classification of yeasts. Principal findings include: 1) budding ascomycetous yeasts are monophyletic and represent a sister group to the filamentous ascomycetes. 2) fission …,True,PlYZvqQAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,261,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/yea.320101306,13397302464349834844,/scholar?cites=13397302464349834844,,,0,0,0

Before the present era of yeast taxonomy. which uses gene sequences and other molecular criteria. identifications were of necessity based on phenotypic tests. Although phenotype can sometimes be used to correctly identify species. molecular comparisons have shown that many earlier identifications based on phenotype have been incorrect.

Hygrophobic aerial conidia have been described for several species of Ustilaginales. such as Ustilago hypodytes (Schlecht.) Fr. and Sorosporium saponariae Rudolphi (13). While we try to avoid introducing separate anamorph binomials for holomorphic species. the species listed above seem to lack a perfect state or it is presently unknown. As species of smuts can be identified only on teleomorphic characteristics. such as host range. morphology of soni and teliospores (19. 22). it is difficult to compare the anamorphic species listed above with known species of smuts. Therefore comparative morphological. physiological. biochemical and molecular investigations of anamorphs of smuts will be useful. However. because several hundreds of species of smuts are involved. this task is not easily performed. A second possibility is to compare ribosomal DNA sequences in order to establish their phylogenetic position. Partial nucleotide sequences of the 26S ribosomal DNA of these anamorph species clearly place them in the same group together with U. maydis (Fig. 1)(5. 8).

Here we systematically identify hundreds of genes that were likely acquired horizontally from a variety of sources by the early-diverging fungal phyla Microsporidia and Cryptomycota. Interestingly. the Microsporidia have acquired via HGT several genes involved in nucleic acid synthesis and salvage. such as those encoding thymidine kinase (TK). cytidylate kinase. and purine nucleotide phosphorylase. We show that these HGT-derived nucleic acid synthesis genes tend to function at the interface between the metabolic networks of the host and pathogen.

Unlike ale-style beers. which are generally brewed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. lagers are brewed at colder temperatures with allopolyploid hybrids of Saccharomyces eubayanus x S. cerevisiae. Since the discovery of S. eubayanus in 2011. additional strains have been isolated from South America. North America. Australasia. and Asia. but only interspecies hybrids have been isolated in Europe. Here. using genome sequence data. we examine the relationships of these wild S. eubayanus strains to each other and to domesticated lager strains. Our results support the existence of a relatively low-diversity (π = 0.00197) lineage of S. eubayanus whose distribution stretches across the Holarctic ecozone and includes wild isolates from Tibet. new wild isolates from North America. and the S. eubayanus parents of lager yeasts. This Holarctic lineage is closely related to a population with higher diversity (π = 0.00275) that has been found primarily in South America but includes some widely distributed isolates. A second diverse South American population (π = 0.00354) and two early-diverging Asian subspecies are more distantly related. We further show that no single wild strain from the Holarctic lineage is the sole closest relative of lager yeasts. Instead. different parts of the genome portray different phylogenetic signals and ancestry. likely due to outcrossing and incomplete lineage sorting.

Here. we use RNA-sequencing to identify host genes that are upregulated upon Plasmodium berghei infection of hepatocytes with the hypothesis that host pathways are hijacked to benefit parasite development. We found that expression of aquaporin-3 (AQP3). a water and glycerol channel. is significantly induced in Plasmodium-infected hepatocytes compared to uninfected cells. This aquaglyceroporin localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. the compartmental interface between the host and pathogen. with a temporal pattern that correlates with the parasite’s expansion in the liver. Depletion or elimination of host AQP3 expression significantly reduces P. berghei parasite burden during the liver stage and chemical disruption by a known AQP3 inhibitor. auphen. reduces P. falciparum asexual blood stage and P. berghei liver stage parasite load. Further use of this inhibitor as a chemical probe suggests that AQP3-mediated nutrient transport is an important function for parasite development. This study reveals a previously unknown potential route for host-dependent nutrient acquisition by Plasmodium which was discovered by mapping the transcriptional changes that occur in hepatocytes throughout P. berghei infection.

To address these questions. we have defined and characterized the major chemoreceptor families in a pair of behaviorally and evolutionarily distinct ant species. Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator. Through comprehensive re-annotation. we show that these ant species harbor some of the largest yet known repertoires of odorant receptors (Ors) among insects. as well as a more modest number of gustatory receptors (Grs) and variant ionotropic glutamate receptors (Irs). Our phylogenetic analyses further demonstrate remarkably rapid gains and losses of ant Ors. while Grs and Irs have also experienced birth-and-death evolution to different degrees. In addition. comparisons of antennal transcriptomes between sexes identify many chemoreceptors that are differentially expressed between males and females and between species. We have also revealed an agonist for a worker-enriched OR from C. floridanus. representing the first case of a heterologously characterized ant tuning Or. Collectively. our analysis reveals a large number of ant chemoreceptors exhibiting patterns of …,True,AGl1eyAAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,159,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002930,1950048398305654385,/scholar?cites=1950048398305654385,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002930,0,0,0

To understand budding yeast evolution. we analyzed the genomes of 332 yeast species. including 220 newly sequenced ones. which represent nearly one-third of all known budding yeast diversity. Here. we establish a robust genus-level phylogeny comprising 12 major clades. infer the timescale of diversification from the Devonian period to the present. quantify horizontal gene transfer (HGT). and reconstruct the evolution of 45 metabolic traits and the metabolic toolkit of the budding yeast common ancestor (BYCA). We infer that BYCA was metabolically complex and chronicle the tempo and mode of genomic and phenotypic evolution across the subphylum. which is characterized by very low HGT levels and widespread losses of traits and the genes that control them.

In the last two decades. the use of rDNA and multilocus data sets has greatly advanced our understanding of the yeast phylogeny. but many deep relationships remain unsupported. In contrast. phylogenomic analyses have involved relatively few taxa and lineages that were often selected with limited considerations for covering the breadth of yeast biodiversity. Here we used genome sequence data from 86 publicly available yeast genomes representing nine of the 11 known major lineages and 10 nonyeast fungal outgroups to generate a 1233-gene. 96-taxon data matrix.

Odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) express specific odorant receptors (ORs) encoded by a dramatically expanded gene family in ants. In most eusocial insects. only the queen can transmit genetic information. restricting genetic studies. In contrast. workers in Harpegnathos saltator ants can be converted into gamergates (pseudoqueens) that can found entire colonies. This feature facilitated CRISPR-Cas9 generation of germline mutations in orco. the gene that encodes the obligate co-receptor of all ORs. orco mutations should significantly impact olfaction.

To continue gaining insight into the relationship between gene expression and olfaction. we have performed cohort comparisons of antennal transcript abundances at five time points after a blood meal. a key event in both reproduction and disease transmission cycles. We found that more than 5.000 transcripts displayed significant abundance differences. many of which were correlated by cluster analysis. Within the chemosensory gene families. we observed a general reduction in the level of chemosensory gene transcripts. although a subset of odorant receptors (AgOrs) was modestly enhanced in post–blood-fed samples.

For example. several different fast programs have been developed in the very popular maximum likelihood framework. including RAxML/ExaML. PhyML. IQ-TREE. and FastTree. Although these programs are widely used. a systematic evaluation and comparison of their performance using empirical genome-scale data matrices has so far been lacking. To address this question. we evaluated these four programs on 19 empirical phylogenomic data sets with hundreds to thousands of genes and up to 200 taxa with respect to likelihood maximization. tree topology. and computational speed.

However. because chemoreceptor repertoires have been characterized in few social insects and their solitary relatives. a comprehensive examination of this hypothesis has not been possible. Here. we annotate ∼3.000 odorant and gustatory receptors in recently sequenced Hymenoptera genomes and systematically compare >4.000 chemoreceptors from 13 hymenopterans. representing one solitary lineage (wasps) and three independently evolved eusocial lineages (ants and two bees).

1103049,Evolutionary history of histone demethylase families: distinct evolutionary patterns suggest functional divergence,2008,Xiaofan Zhou and Hong Ma,8,BMC Evolutionary Biology,1,1-16,BioMed Central,Histone methylation can dramatically affect chromatin structure and gene expression and was considered irreversible until recent discoveries of two families of histone demethylases. the KDM1 (previously LSD1) and JmjC domain-containing proteins. These two types of proteins have different functional domains and distinct substrate specificities. Although more and more KDM1 and JmjC proteins have been shown to have histone demethylase activity. our knowledge about their evolution history is limited. We performed systematic phylogenetic analysis of these histone demethylase families and uncovered different evolutionary patterns. The KDM1 genes have been maintained with a stable low copy number in most organisms except for a few duplication events in flowering plants. In contrast. multiple genes for JmjC proteins with distinct domain architectures were present before the split of major eukaryotic groups. and experienced subsequent birth-and-death evolution. In addition. distinct evolutionary patterns can also be observed between animal and plant histone demethylases in both families. Furthermore. our results showed that some JmjC subfamilies contain only animal genes with specific demethylase activities. but do not have plant members. Our study improves the understanding about the evolutionary history of KDM1 and JmjC genes and provides valuable insights into their functions. Based on the phylogenetic relationship. we discussed possible histone demethylase activities for several plant JmjC proteins. Finally. we proposed that the observed differences in evolutionary pattern imply functional divergence between animal and …,True,AGl1eyAAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,76,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-8-294,8639266404528012773,/scholar?cites=8639266404528012773,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-8-294,0,0,0
