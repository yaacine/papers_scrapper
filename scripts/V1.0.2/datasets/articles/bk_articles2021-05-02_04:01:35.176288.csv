1278389,Network modelling methods for FMRI,2011,Stephen M Smith and Karla L Miller and Gholamreza Salimi-Khorshidi and Matthew Webster and Christian F Beckmann and Thomas E Nichols and Joseph D Ramsey and Mark W Woolrich,54,Neuroimage,2,875-891,Academic Press,There is great interest in estimating brain “networks” from FMRI data. This is often attempted by identifying a set of functional “nodes” (e.g.. spatial ROIs or ICA maps) and then conducting a connectivity analysis between the nodes. based on the FMRI timeseries associated with the nodes. Analysis methods range from very simple measures that consider just two nodes at a time (e.g.. correlation between two nodes' timeseries) to sophisticated approaches that consider all nodes simultaneously and estimate one global network model (e.g.. Bayes net models). Many different methods are being used in the literature. but almost none has been carefully validated or compared for use on FMRI timeseries data. In this work we generate rich. realistic simulated FMRI data for a wide range of underlying networks. experimental protocols and problematic confounds in the data. in order to compare different connectivity estimation …,True,2cWcY-MAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1738,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910011602,3881399914927396325,/scholar?cites=3881399914927396325,,,https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/org/fmri-research/Smith-FMRI-2011.pdf,0,0,0

Independent component analysis (ICA) – one of the most widely used techniques for the exploratory analysis of fMRI data – has shown to be a powerful technique in identifying various sources of neuronally-related and artefactual fluctuation in fMRI data (both with the application of external stimuli and with the subject “at rest”). ICA decomposes fMRI data into patterns of activity (a set of spatial maps and their corresponding time series) that are statistically independent and add linearly to explain voxel-wise time series. Given the set of ICA components. if the components representing “signal” (brain activity) can be distinguished form the “noise” components (effects of motion. non-neuronal physiology. scanner artefacts and other nuisance sources). the latter can …,True,2cWcY-MAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1046,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811913011956,1580627315919621966,/scholar?cites=1580627315919621966,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4019210/,0,0,0

The utilization of the CNN also allows for learning image representations. Unlike other supervised methods that require pair-wised inputs for binary code learning. our method learns hash codes and image representations in a point-wised manner. making it suitable for large-scale datasets.

By incorporating multiple kernels and automatically adjusting the kernel weights. MKFC is more immune to ineffective kernels and irrelevant features. This makes the choice of kernels less crucial.

Due to the ill-posed nature of this nonlinear inverse scattering problem. this parametrization approach is needed when the available measurement data are limited and measurements are only carried out from limited transmitter-receiver positions (limited data diversity). By carrying out this parametrization. the number of unknown model parameters that need to be inverted is manageable. Hence the Newton based approach can advantageously be used over gradient-based approaches.

When the size of the linear system of equations is large. the use of this noniterative solver is impractical.

Since this problem involves a large number of unknowns. it has to be solved effectively and efficiently so that the results can be obtained in timely manner. The forward modeling is based on a domain integral equation approach formulated in terms of the electric and magnetic contrast sources normalized with the characteristic impedance of the background medium. Our numerical tests indicate that this formulation is prerequisite in order to arrive at a forward solution within an acceptable number of iterations. and hence it is also of significant importance in the optimization process of the inverse problem.

EM and seismic data are jointly inverted using a cross-gradient constraint that enforces structural similarity between the conductivity image and the compressional wave (P-wave) velocity image. The inversion algorithm is based on a Gauss-Newton optimization approach. Because of the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. regularization is used to constrain the solution. The multiplicative regularization technique selects the regularization parameters automatically. improving the robustness of the algorithm. A multifrequency data-weighting scheme prevents the high-frequency data from dominating the inversion process.

This algorithm inverts all frequency data components simultaneously. A data-weighting scheme balances the contributions from different frequency data components so the inversion process does not become dominated by high-frequency data components. which produce a velocity image with many artifacts. A Gauss-Newton minimization approach achieves a high convergence rate and an accurate reconstructed velocity image. By introducing a modified adjoint formulation. we can calculate the Jacobian matrix efficiently. allowing the material properties in the perfectly matched layers (PMLs) to be updated automatically during the inversion process.

The main advantage is that we do not have to determine the regularization parameter before the inversion process is started. We consider different norms of the total variation as regularization factor.

Unlike the CSI method using the integral equation (IE) approach. the FD-CSI method can readily employ an arbitrary inhomogeneous medium as its background. The ability to use an inhomogeneous background medium has made this algorithm very suitable to be used in through-wall imaging and time-lapse inversion applications.

1278459,Tvsum: Summarizing web videos using titles,2015,Yale Song and Jordi Vallmitjana and Amanda Stent and Alejandro Jaimes,,,,5179-5187,,Video summarization is a challenging problem in part because knowing which part of a video is important requires prior knowledge about its main topic. We present TVSum. an unsupervised video summarization framework that uses title-based image search results to find visually important shots. We observe that a video title is often carefully chosen to be maximally descriptive of its main topic. and hence images related to the title can serve as a proxy for important visual concepts of the main topic. However. because titles are free-formed. unconstrained. and often written ambiguously. images searched using the title can contain noise (images irrelevant to video content) and variance (images of different topics). To deal with this challenge. we developed a novel co-archetypal analysis technique that learns canonical visual concepts shared between video and images. but not in either alone. by finding a joint-factorial representation of two data sets. We introduce a new benchmark dataset. TVSum50. that contains 50 videos and their shot-level importance scores annotated via crowdsourcing. Experimental results on two datasets.

Motivated by the observation that important visual concepts tend to appear repeatedly across videos of the same topic. we propose to summarize a video by finding shots that co-occur most frequently across videos collected using a topic keyword. The main technical challenge is dealing with the sparsity of co-occurring patterns. out of hundreds to possibly thousands of irrelevant shots in videos being considered. To deal with this challenge. we developed a Maximal Biclique Finding (MBF) algorithm that is optimized to find sparsely co-occurring patterns. discarding less co-occurring patterns even if they are dominant in one video. Our algorithm is parallelizable with closed-form updates. thus can easily scale up to handle a large number of videos simultaneously.

1278472,A dynamic conditional random field model for joint labeling of object and scene classes,2008,Christian Wojek and Bernt Schiele,,,,733-747,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Object detection and pixel-wise scene labeling have both been active research areas in recent years and impressive results have been reported for both tasks separately. The integration of these different types of approaches should boost performance for both tasks as object detection can profit from powerful scene labeling and also pixel-wise scene labeling can profit from powerful object detection. Consequently. first approaches have been proposed that aim to integrate both object detection and scene labeling in one framework. This paper proposes a novel approach based on conditional random field (CRF) models that extends existing work by 1) formulating the integration as a joint labeling problem of object and scene classes and 2) by systematically integrating dynamic information for the object detection task as well as for the scene labeling task. As a result. the approach is applicable to highly …,True,SI6sQPYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,149,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-88693-8_54,8052057512475087506,/scholar?cites=8052057512475087506,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-88693-8_54.pdf,0,0,0

In this contribution. backpropagation training is based on a modified steepest descent method which allows variable stepsize. It is computationally efficient and posseses interesting convergence properties utilizing estimates of the Lipschitz constant without any additional computational cost. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on several problems and the results have been very satisfactory. Numerical evidence shows that the method is robust with good average performance on many classes of problems.

Vrahatis and George S Androulakis,11,Neural Computation,7,1769-1796,MIT Press,This article focuses on gradient-based backpropagation algorithms that use either a common adaptive learning rate for all weights or an individual adaptive learning rate for each weight and apply the Goldstein/Armijo line search. The learning-rate adaptation is based on descent techniques and estimates of the local Lipschitz constant that are obtained without additional error function and gradient evaluations. The proposed algorithms improve the backpropagation training in terms of both convergence rate and convergence characteristics. such as stable learning and robustness to oscillations. Simulations are conducted to compare and evaluate the convergence behavior of these gradient-based training algorithms with several popular training methods.,True,AJ4xClEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,193,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/089976699300016223,17848454636466514641,/scholar?cites=17848454636466514641,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44581328/Increasing_the_convergence_rate_of_the_e20160409-17097-16ahxth.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we report initial studies on a new kind of transistor. the I-MOS. The I-MOS uses modulation of the breakdown voltage of a gated p-i-n structure in order to switch from the OFF to the ON state and vice versa. Since impact-ionization is an abrupt function of the electric field (or the carrier energy). simulations show that the device has a subthreshold slope much lower than kT/q. Simulations also show that it is indeed possible to make complementary circuits with switching speeds comparable to or exceeding CMOS.

To address this cost. a number of quantization schemes have been proposed-but most of these techniques focused on quantizing weights. which are relatively smaller in size compared to activations. This paper proposes a novel quantization scheme for activations during training-that enables neural networks to work well with ultra low precision weights and activations without any significant accuracy degradation. This technique. PArameterized Clipping acTivation (PACT). uses an activation clipping parameter  that is optimized during training to find the right quantization scale. PACT allows quantizing activations to arbitrary bit precisions. while achieving much better accuracy relative to published state-of-the-art quantization schemes. We show. for the first time. that both weights and activations can be quantized to 4-bits of precision while still achieving accuracy comparable to full precision networks across a range of popular models and datasets.

1278548,Deformable part descriptors for fine-grained recognition and attribute prediction,2013,Ning Zhang and Ryan Farrell and Forrest Iandola and Trevor Darrell,,,,729-736,,Recognizing objects in fine-grained domains can be extremely challenging due to the subtle differences between subcategories. Discriminative markings are often highly localized. leading traditional object recognition approaches to struggle with the large pose variation often present in these domains. Pose-normalization seeks to align training exemplars. either piecewise by part or globally for the whole object. effectively factoring out differences in pose and in viewing angle. Prior approaches relied on computationally-expensive filter ensembles for part localization and required extensive supervision. This paper proposes two pose-normalized descriptors based on computationally-efficient deformable part models. The first leverages the semantics inherent in strongly-supervised DPM parts. The second exploits weak semantic annotations to learn cross-component correspondences. computing pose-normalized descriptors from the latent parts of a weakly-supervised DPM.

In this paper we present FireCaffe. which successfully scales deep neural network training across a cluster of GPUs. We also present a number of best practices to aid in comparing advancements in methods for scaling and accelerating the training of deep neural networks. The speed and scalability of distributed algorithms is almost always limited by the overhead of communicating between servers; DNN training is not an exception to this rule. Therefore. the key consideration here is to reduce communication overhead wherever possible. while not degrading the accuracy of the DNN models that we train. Our approach has three key pillars. First. we select network hardware that achieves high bandwidth between GPU servers--Infiniband or Cray interconnects are ideal for this. Second. we consider a number of communication algorithms. and we find that reduction trees are more efficient and scalable than the traditional parameter server approach.

1278550,How to scale distributed deep learning?,2016,Peter H Jin and Qiaochu Yuan and Forrest Iandola and Kurt Keutzer,,,,,,Training time on large datasets for deep neural networks is the principal workflow bottleneck in a number of important applications of deep learning. such as object classification and detection in automatic driver assistance systems (ADAS). To minimize training time. the training of a deep neural network must be scaled beyond a single machine to as many machines as possible by distributing the optimization method used for training. While a number of approaches have been proposed for distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD). at the current time synchronous approaches to distributed SGD appear to be showing the greatest performance at large scale. Synchronous scaling of SGD suffers from the need to synchronize all processors on each gradient step and is not resilient in the face of failing or lagging processors. In asynchronous approaches using parameter servers. training is slowed by contention to the parameter server. In this paper we compare the convergence of synchronous and asynchronous SGD for training a modern ResNet network architecture on the ImageNet classification problem. We also propose an asynchronous method. gossiping SGD. that aims to retain the positive features of both systems by replacing the all-reduce collective operation of synchronous training with a gossip aggregation algorithm. We find. perhaps counterintuitively. that asynchronous SGD. including both elastic averaging and gossiping. converges faster at fewer nodes (up to about 32 nodes). whereas synchronous SGD scales better to more nodes (up to about 100 nodes).,True,y1lVpBEAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,94,https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04581,9347241642020495057,/scholar?cites=9347241642020495057,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04581,0,0,0

It takes the regular type of symmetrical double-edge sinusoidal modulation. assumes that the load current is sinusoidal. and shows that the inherent Bessel Function solution can be reduced to a simple algebraic form when the frequency ratio is greater than ten or so. It is assumed that the on-state voltage drop across an active device and a free-wheel diode is made up of a constant component plus a component that is linearly dependent upon current.

1278572,Diploma thesis Face detection with Waldboost algorithm,2007,Zdenek Kálal,,,,,,Face detection algorithms based on the work of Viola and Jones [11] train the classifier by processing training examples of face and non-face patterns. A general effort is to process a large number of training examples and hence describe the problem accurately. Current approaches are based on the assumption that non-face patterns can be easily obtained contrary to faces. While the faces remain in the training the whole time. the easy non-face patterns are stepwise replaced with more difficult ones. In the case when a large number of faces is at disposal. such conventional techniques are not able to process the whole positive training set effectively. The main contribution of this thesis is the improvement of the Waldboost algorithm [12] by which the positive training patterns are treated in a similar way as non-face patterns. called symmetric bootstrap. In the symmetric bootstrap. both the easy positive-and easy negative-patterns are stepwise replaced with more difficult ones and hence bigger space of faces is explored in the training. In order to show the effect of symmetric bootstrap. sufficiently large pool of positive training patterns had to be found and the non-face distribution appropriately modeled. A new bounding box alignment. which does not require any feature points. was found. This alignment enables us to easily collect training data from different sources (eg on-line face detectors) and simplifies the training task. which leads to higher detection rates of the classifier. The space of the positive training patterns was further enlarged by the technique. which is able to generate new faces from already seen ones. called face synthesis.

A 400 mega- chip per second channel sounder with steerable 24.5 dBi horn antennas at the transmitter and receiver was used to measure the angular distributions of received multipath power over a wide range of propagation distances and urban settings. Measurements were also made to study the small-scale fading of closely-spaced power delay profiles recorded at half-wavelength (5.35 mm) increments along a small-scale linear track (10 wavelengths. or 107 mm) at two different receiver locations.

Pixel2Style2Pixel (pSp). Our pSp framework is based on a novel encoder network that directly generates a series of style vectors which are fed into a pretrained StyleGAN generator. forming the extended W+ latent space. We first show that our encoder can directly embed real images into W+. with no additional optimization. We further introduce a dedicated identity loss which is shown to achieve improved performance in the reconstruction of an input image. We demonstrate pSp to be a simple architecture that. by leveraging a well-trained. fixed generator network. can be easily applied on a wide-range of image-to-image translation tasks. Solving these tasks through the style representation results in a global approach that does not rely on a local pixel-to-pixel correspondence and further supports multi-modal synthesis via the resampling of styles. Notably. we demonstrate that pSp can be trained to align a face image to a frontal pose without any labeled data. generate multi-modal results for ambiguous tasks such as conditional face generation from segmentation maps. and construct high-resolution images from corresponding low-resolution images.,True,jKnGFpAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,24,https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00951,80610474874539278,/scholar?cites=80610474874539278,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00951,0,0,0

This property requires us to carefully process all the pixels in an image in order to accurately localize all text instances. In particular. for the more difficult task of localizing small text regions. many methods use an enlarged image or even several rescaled ones as their input. This significantly increases the processing time of the entire image and needlessly enlarges background regions. If we were to have a prior telling us the coarse location of text instances in the image and their approximate scale. we could have adaptively chosen which regions to process and how to rescale them. thus significantly reducing the processing time. To estimate this prior we propose a segmentation-based network with an additional"" scale predictor"". an output channel that predicts the scale of each text segment. The network is applied on a scaled down image to efficiently approximate the desired prior. without processing all the pixels of the original image. The approximated prior is then used to create a compact image containing only text regions. resized to a canonical scale. which is fed again to the segmentation network for fine-grained detection. We show that our approach offers a powerful alternative to fixed scaling schemes. achieving an equivalent accuracy to larger input scales while processing far fewer pixels.

The idea is to extend the NMF algorithm in order to extract features that enforce not only the spatial locality. but also the separability between classes in a discriminant manner. The first method employs discriminant analysis in the features derived from NMF. In this way. a two-phase discriminant feature extraction procedure is implemented. namely NMF plus Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The second method incorporates the discriminant constraints inside the NMF decomposition. Thus. a decomposition of a face to its discriminant parts is obtained and new update rules for both the weights and the basis images are derived.

The first method is robust against 3D rotation. translation. and uniform scaling. The second one is robust against both geometric and mesh simplification attacks. A pseudorandom watermarking signal is cast in the 3D mesh object by deforming its vertices geometrically. without altering the vertex topology. Prior to watermark embedding and detection. the object is rotated and translated so that its center of mass and its principal component coincide with the origin and the z-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. This geometrical transformation ensures watermark robustness to translation and rotation. Robustness to uniform scaling is achieved by restricting the vertex deformations to occur only along the r coordinate of the corresponding (r. /spl theta/. /spl phi/) spherical coordinate system.

Existing research on tag recommendation either focuses on improving its accuracy or on automating the process. while ignoring the efficiency issue. We propose a highly-automated novel framework for real-time tag recommendation. The tagged training documents are treated as triplets of (words. docs. tags). and represented in two bipartite graphs. which are partitioned into clusters by Spectral Recursive Embedding (SRE). Tags in each topical cluster are ranked by our novel ranking algorithm. A two-way Poisson Mixture Model (PMM) is proposed to model the document distribution into mixture components within each cluster and aggregate words into word clusters simultaneously.

Tagging is the action of connecting a relevant user-defined keyword to a document. image. or video. which helps the user to better organize and share their collections of interesting stuff. With the rapid growth of Web 2.0. tagged data is becoming more and more abundant on the social network Web sites. An interesting problem is how to automate the process of making tag recommendations to users when a new resource becomes available.In this article. we address the issue of tag recommendation from a machine learning perspective.

Since rare queries possess much less information (eg. clicks) than popular queries in the query logs. it is much more difficult to efficiently suggest relevant queries to a rare query.

Cognitive tasks have an impact on breathing and heart rate variability (HRV). We show that changes in physiological parameters during cognitive stress can be captured remotely (at a distance of 3m) using a digital camera. A study (n=10) was conducted with participants at rest and under cognitive stress. A novel five band digital camera was used to capture videos of the face of the participant. Significantly higher normalized low frequency HRV components and breathing rates were measured in the stress condition when compared to the rest condition. Heart rates were not significantly different between the two conditions. We built a person-independent classifier to predict cognitive stress based on the remotely detected physiological parameters (heart rate. breathing rate and heart rate variability).

In the past. GPUs enabled these breakthroughs because of their greater computational speed. In the future. faster computation at both training and test time is likely to be crucial for further progress and for consumer applications on low-power devices. As a result. there is much interest in research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL). Binary weights. ie. weights which are constrained to only two possible values (eg-1 or 1). would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations. as multipliers are the most space and power-hungry components of the digital implementation of neural networks. We introduce BinaryConnect. a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations. while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated.

Since most of the computation in training neural networks is typically spent on floating point multiplications. we investigate an approach to training that eliminates the need for most of these.

Second. while back-propagating error derivatives. in addition to binarizing the weights. we quantize the representations at each layer to convert the remaining multiplications into binary shifts.

Binary neural networks (BNN) help to alleviate the prohibitive resource requirements of DNN. where both activations and weights are limited to 1-bit. We propose an improved binary training method (BNN+). by introducing a regularization function that encourages training weights around binary values.

Convolutional Layers (CLs) are key to the accuracy of deep learning methods. However. it is often required to assemble a large number of CLs. each containing thousands of parameters. in order to reach state-of-the-art accuracy. thus resulting in complex and demanding systems that are poorly fitted to resource-limited devices. Recently. methods have been proposed to replace the generic convolution operator by the combination of a shift operation and a simpler 1x1 convolution. The resulting block. called Shift Layer (SL). is an efficient alternative to CLs in the sense it allows to reach similar accuracies on various tasks with faster computations and fewer parameters. In this contribution. we introduce Shift Attention Layers (SALs). which extend SLs by using an attention mechanism that learns which shifts are the best at the same time the network function is trained.

We demonstrate that our method learns thrifty representations while maintaining accuracy. With ImageNet. the method produces an average per layer bitlength of 4.13 and 3.76 bits on AlexNet and ResNet18 respectively. remaining within 2.0% and 0.5% of the baseline TOP-1 accuracy.,True,Q8K3FjQAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03090,2199675479321221145,/scholar?cites=2199675479321221145,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03090,0,0,0

Convolutional Layers (CLs) are key to the accuracy of deep learning methods. However. it is often required to assemble a large number of CLs. each containing thousands of parameters. in order to reach state-of-the-art accuracy. thus resulting in complex and demanding systems that are poorly fitted to resource-limited devices. Recently. methods have been proposed to replace the generic convolution operator by the combination of a shift operation and a simpler 1x1 convolution. The resulting block. called Shift Layer (SL). is an efficient alternative to CLs in the sense it allows to reach similar accuracies on various tasks with faster computations and fewer parameters. In this contribution. we introduce Shift Attention Layers (SALs). which extend SLs by using an attention mechanism that learns which shifts are the best at the same time the network function is …,True,Q8K3FjQAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190512300B/abstract,,,,,,0,0,0

A dense disparity map is computed from the images of a stereo camera carried by the user. By using the dense disparity map. potential obstacles can be detected in 3D in indoor and outdoor scenarios. A ground plane estimation algorithm based on RANSAC plus filtering techniques allows the robust detection of the ground in every frame. A polar grid representation is proposed to account for the potential obstacles in the scene. The design is completed with acoustic feedback to assist visually impaired users while approaching obstacles. Beep sounds with different frequencies and repetitions inform the user about the presence of obstacles. Audio bone conducting technology is employed to play these sounds without interrupting the visually impaired user from hearing other important sounds from its local environment.

Traditional visual SLAM methods assume static features in the environment and that a dominant part of the scene changes only due to camera egomotion. These assumptions make traditional visual SLAM methods prone to failure in crowded real-world dynamic environments with many independently moving objects. such as the typical environments for the visually impaired. By means of a dense scene flow representation. moving objects can be detected. In this way. the visual SLAM process can be improved considerably. by not adding erroneous measurements into the estimation. yielding more consistent and improved localization and mapping results.

However. compared to ν-Support Vector Classification (ν-SVC)(Schölkopf et al.. 2000). ν-SVR introduces an additional linear term into its objective function.

In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) in particular. due to host mobility. such operations are expected to be executed more frequently (such as finding a route to a particular host. paging a particular host. and sending an alarm signal). Because radio signals are likely to overlap with others in a geographical area. a straightforward broadcasting by flooding is usually very costly and will result in serious redundancy. contention. and collision. to which we call the broadcast storm problem. In this paper. we identify this problem by showing how serious it is through analyses and simulations. We propose several schemes to reduce redundant rebroadcasts and differentiate timing of rebroadcasts to alleviate this problem. Simulation results are presented. which show different levels of improvement over the basic flooding approach.,True,u2dlm1MAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,5475,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1013763825347,4809492368772276750,/scholar?cites=4809492368772276750,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/313451.313525,0,0,0

To deal with the dynamic changing topology of a MANET. many routing protocols have been proposed. In this paper. we consider the route maintenance problem. which includes two parts: route deterioration and route breakage. In a MANET. a route may suddenly become broken because only one host roams away. Even if a route remains connected. it may become worse due to host mobility or a better route newly being formed in the system. Existing protocols. however. will stick with a fixed route once it is discovered. until it is expired or broken. In this paper. we show how to enhance several existing protocols with route optimization and local route recovery capability.

An accurate and reproducible automatic segmentation is of high interest. since the lesion volume is an important end-point for clinical trials. However. various factors. such as the high variance in lesion shape. location and appearance. render it a difficult task.   Methods In this article. nine classification methods (e.g. Generalized Linear Models. Random Decision Forests and Convolutional Neural Networks) are evaluated and compared with each other using 37 multiparametric MRI datasets of ischemic stroke patients in the sub-acute phase in terms of their accuracy and reliability for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation.

It is usually done by non-linear registration of image scans at different states of the breathing cycle but without further modeling of specific physiological motion properties. In this context. the accurate computation of respiration-driven lung motion is especially challenging because this organ is sliding along the surrounding tissue during the breathing cycle. leading to discontinuities in the motion field.

Traditional approaches to multi-label image classification learn independent classifiers for each category and employ ranking or thresholding on the classification results. These techniques. although working well. fail to explicitly exploit the label dependencies in an image. In this paper. we utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address this problem. Combined with CNNs. the proposed CNN-RNN framework learns a joint image-label embedding to characterize the semantic label dependency as well as the image-label relevance. and it can be trained end-to-end from scratch to integrate both information in an unified framework.

The quality of the generated answers of our mQA model on this dataset is evaluated by human judges through a Turing Test. Specifically. we mix the answers provided by humans and our model.

This paper presents an interpolative reasoning method by means of scale and move transformations. It can be used to interpolate fuzzy rules involving complex polygon. Gaussian or other bell-shaped fuzzy membership functions. The method works by first constructing a new inference rule via manipulating two given adjacent rules. and then by using scale and move transformations to convert the intermediate inference results into the final derived conclusions. This method has three advantages thanks to the proposed transformations: 1) it can handle interpolation of multiple antecedent variables with simple computation; 2) it guarantees the uniqueness as well as normality and convexity of the resulting interpolated fuzzy sets; and 3) it suggests a variety of definitions for …,True,uW8JaBsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,218,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1618524/,6160681816676061651,/scholar?cites=6160681816676061651,,,https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/908/fuzzyInterpolative.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

It has been successfully applied to systems control. but limited work exists for its applications to tasks like prediction and classification. Almost all fuzzy interpolation techniques in the literature make strong assumptions that there are two closest adjacent rules available to the observation. and that such rules must flank the observation for each attribute.

In this paper. we propose to learn anomalies by exploiting both normal and anomalous videos. To avoid annotating the anomalous segments or clips in training videos. which is very time consuming. we propose to learn anomaly through the deep multiple instance ranking framework by leveraging weakly labeled training videos. ie the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at video-level instead of clip-level. In our approach. we consider normal and anomalous videos as bags and video segments as instances in multiple instance learning (MIL). and automatically learn a deep anomaly ranking model that predicts high anomaly scores for anomalous video segments. Furthermore. we introduce sparsity and temporal smoothness constraints in the ranking loss function to better localize anomaly during training. We also introduce a new large-scale first of its kind dataset of 128 hours of videos. It consists of 1900 long and untrimmed real-world surveillance videos. with 13 realistic anomalies such as fighting. road accident. burglary. robbery. etc. as well as normal activities. This dataset can be used for two tasks. First. general anomaly detection considering all anomalies in one group and all normal activities in another group.

1278767,Tube convolutional neural network (t-cnn) for action detection in videos,2017,Rui Hou and Chen Chen and Mubarak Shah,,,,5822-5831,,Deep learning has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for image classification and object detection. However. the impact of deep learning on video analysis (eg action detection and recognition) has been limited due to complexity of video data and lack of annotations. Previous convolutional neural networks (CNN) based video action detection approaches usually consist of two major steps: frame-level action proposal detection and association of proposals across frames. Also. these methods employ two-stream CNN framework to handle spatial and temporal feature separately. In this paper. we propose an end-to-end deep network called Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for action detection in videos. The proposed architecture is a unified network that is able to recognize and localize action based on 3D convolution features. A video is first divided into equal length clips and for each clip a set of tube proposals are generated next based on 3D Convolutional Network (ConvNet) features. Finally. the tube proposals of different clips are linked together employing network flow and spatio-temporal action detection is performed using these linked video proposals.

Gabor features have currently been successfully applied for hyperspectral image analysis due to the ability to represent useful spatial information. MH prediction preprocessing makes use of the spatial piecewise-continuous nature of hyperspectral imagery to integrate spectral and spatial information. The proposed Gabor-filtering-based KELM classifier and MH-prediction-based KELM classifier have been validated on two real hyperspectral datasets.

We present four tests of the consistency of the data with binary black hole gravitational waveforms predicted by general relativity. One test subtracts the best-fit waveform from the data and checks the consistency of the residual with detector noise. The second test checks the consistency of the low-and high-frequency parts of the observed signals.

1278798,Deep unfolding: Model-based inspiration of novel deep architectures,2014,John R Hershey and Jonathan Le Roux and Felix Weninger,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.2574,,,,Model-based methods and deep neural networks have both been tremendously successful paradigms in machine learning. In model-based methods. problem domain knowledge can be built into the constraints of the model. typically at the expense of difficulties during inference. In contrast. deterministic deep neural networks are constructed in such a way that inference is straightforward. but their architectures are generic and it is unclear how to incorporate knowledge. This work aims to obtain the advantages of both approaches. To do so. we start with a model-based approach and an associated inference algorithm. and\emph {unfold} the inference iterations as layers in a deep network. Rather than optimizing the original model. we\emph {untie} the model parameters across layers. in order to create a more powerful network. The resulting architecture can be trained discriminatively to perform accurate inference within a fixed network size. We show how this framework allows us to interpret conventional networks as mean-field inference in Markov random fields. and to obtain new architectures by instead using belief propagation as the inference algorithm. We then show its application to a non-negative matrix factorization model that incorporates the problem-domain knowledge that sound sources are additive.

In the field of affective computing. there is currently some loosely connected research concerning either of these phenomena. but a holistic computational model of affect in sound is still lacking. In turn. for tomorrow’s pervasive technical systems. including affective companions and robots. it is expected to be highly beneficial to understand the affective dimensions of ’the sound that something makes’. in order to evaluate the systems auditory environment and its own audio output.

Our primary innovation is a new control structure for sequence-to-sequence neural networks---the stack LSTM. Like the conventional stack data structures used in transition-based parsing. elements can be pushed to or popped from the top of the stack in constant time. but. in addition. an LSTM maintains a continuous space embedding of the stack contents. This lets us formulate an efficient parsing model that captures three facets of a parser's state:(i) unbounded look-ahead into the buffer of incoming words.(ii) the complete history of actions taken by the parser. and (iii) the complete contents of the stack of partially built tree fragments. including their internal structures.

In the static declaration strategy that is used in toolkits like Theano. CNTK. and TensorFlow. the user first defines a computation graph (a symbolic representation of the computation). and then examples are fed into an engine that executes this computation and computes its derivatives. In DyNet's dynamic declaration strategy. computation graph construction is mostly transparent. being implicitly constructed by executing procedural code that computes the network outputs. and the user is free to use different network structures for each input. Dynamic declaration thus facilitates the implementation of more complicated network architectures. and DyNet is specifically designed to allow users to implement their models in a way that is idiomatic in their preferred programming language (C++ or Python). One challenge with dynamic declaration is that because the symbolic computation graph is defined anew for every training example. its construction must have low overhead. To achieve this. DyNet has an optimized C++ backend and lightweight graph representation. Experiments show that DyNet's speeds are faster than or comparable with static declaration toolkits. and significantly faster than Chainer. another dynamic declaration toolkit.

Although significant efforts have been dedicated to design and improve mobile CNNs on all dimensions. it is very difficult to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to consider. In this paper. we propose an automated mobile neural architecture search (MNAS) approach. which explicitly incorporate model latency into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work. where latency is considered via another. often inaccurate proxy (eg. FLOPS). our approach directly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobile phones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size. we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that encourages layer diversity throughout the network. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models across multiple vision tasks. On the ImageNet classification task. our MnasNet achieves 75.2% top-1 accuracy with 78ms latency on a Pixel phone. which is 1.8 x faster than MobileNetV2 with 0.5% higher accuracy and 2.3 x faster than NASNet with 1.2% higher accuracy.

This wealth of data—which we are publicly releasing in anonymized form—spans a wide range of dimensions. While we cannot form general conclusions using data from a single site. and clearly this sort of data merits additional in-depth study in a number of ways. in this work we endeavor to characterize a number of the most salient aspects of the traffic.

Our system consists of three independently trained components:(1) a speaker encoder network. trained on a speaker verification task using an independent dataset of noisy speech from thousands of speakers without transcripts. to generate a fixed-dimensional embedding vector from seconds of reference speech from a target speaker;(2) a sequence-to-sequence synthesis network based on Tacotron 2. which generates a mel spectrogram from text. conditioned on the speaker embedding;(3) an auto-regressive WaveNet-based vocoder that converts the mel spectrogram into a sequence of time domain waveform samples.

We quantify the importance of training the speaker encoder on a large and diverse speaker set in order to obtain the best generalization performance.

Following from an extensive literature review. we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field. but promising advances have …,True,eXKdSu0AAAAJ:v6PuF9mNY3oC,822,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsif.2017.0387,6346825306691054156,/scholar?cites=6346825306691054156,,,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsif.2017.0387,0,0,0
1278838,Feature squeezing: Detecting adversarial examples in deep neural networks,2018,Weilin Xu and David Evans and Yanjun Qi,,,,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.01155,Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in many tasks. they can often be fooled by\emph {adversarial examples} that are generated by adding small but purposeful distortions to natural examples. Previous studies to defend against adversarial examples mostly focused on refining the DNN models. but have either shown limited success or required expensive computation. We propose a new strategy.\emph {feature squeezing}. that can be used to harden DNN models by detecting adversarial examples. Feature squeezing reduces the search space available to an adversary by coalescing samples that correspond to many different feature vectors in the original space into a single sample. By comparing a DNN model's prediction on the original input with that on squeezed inputs. feature squeezing detects adversarial examples with high accuracy and few false positives. This paper explores two feature squeezing methods: reducing the color bit depth of each pixel and spatial smoothing. These simple strategies are inexpensive and complementary to other defenses. and can be combined in a joint detection framework to achieve high detection rates against state-of-the-art attacks.,True,eXKdSu0AAAAJ:sfsSB7lKuh0C,763,https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01155,906755737190486859,/scholar?cites=906755737190486859,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01155,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Protein–protein interactions play a key role in many biological systems. High‐throughput methods can directly detect the set of interacting proteins in yeast. but the results are often incomplete and exhibit high false‐positive and false‐negative rates. Recently. many different research groups independently suggested using supervised learning methods to integrate direct and indirect biological data sources for the protein interaction prediction task. However. the data sources. approaches. and implementations varied. Furthermore. the protein interaction prediction task itself can be subdivided into prediction of (1) physical interaction.

1278840,Automatically evading classifiers,2016,Weilin Xu and Yanjun Qi and David Evans,10,Proceedings of the 2016 network and distributed systems symposium,,,,Machine learning is widely used to develop classifiers for security tasks. However. the robustness of these methods against motivated adversaries is uncertain. In this work. we propose a generic method to evaluate the robustness of classifiers under attack. The key idea is to stochastically manipulate a malicious sample to find a variant that preserves the malicious behavior but is classified as benign by the classifier. We present a general approach to search for evasive variants and report on results from experiments using our techniques against two PDF malware classifiers. PDFrate and Hidost. Our method is able to automatically find evasive variants for both classifiers for all of the 500 malicious seeds in our study. Our results suggest a general method for evaluating classifiers used in security applications. and raise serious doubts about the effectiveness of classifiers based on superficial features in the presence of adversaries.,True,eXKdSu0AAAAJ:Lo8V22OuN40C,330,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5e4f/a9397c18062b970910f8ee168d3297cf098f.pdf,672080941662504639,/scholar?cites=672080941662504639,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5e4f/a9397c18062b970910f8ee168d3297cf098f.pdf,0,0,0

This is especially important when integrating high throughput biological data sources because of the high noise rates and the many missing values. In this paper we present a new method to compute such similarities for the task of classifying pairs of proteins as interacting or not. Our method uses direct and indirect information about interaction pairs to constructs a random forest (a collection of decision tress) from a training set. The resulting forest is used to determine the similarity between protein pairs and this similarity is used by a classification algorithm (a modified kNN) to classify protein pairs. Testing the algorithm on yeast data indicates that it is able to improve coverage to 20% of interacting pairs with a false positive rate of 50%.

Computational methods that predict gene expression from histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding their combinatorial effects in gene regulation. This knowledge can help in developing ‘epigenetic drugs’ for diseases like cancer.

We hence propose deep structured energy based models (DSEBMs). where the energy function is the output of a deterministic deep neural network with structure. We develop novel model architectures to integrate EBMs with different types of data such as static data. sequential data. and spatial data. and apply appropriate model architectures to adapt to the data structure. Our training algorithm is built upon the recent development of score matching (Hyvarinen. 2005). which connects an EBM with a regularized autoencoder. eliminating the need for complicated sampling method. Statistically sound decision criterion can be derived for anomaly detection purpose from the perspective of the energy landscape of the data distribution. We investigate two decision criteria for performing anomaly detection: the energy score and the reconstruction error.

In the context of deep neural networks. this idea is often realized by hand-designed network architectures with layers that are shared across tasks and branches that encode task-specific features. However. the space of possible multi-task deep architectures is combinatorially large and often the final architecture is arrived at by manual exploration of this space. which can be both error-prone and tedious. We propose an automatic approach for designing compact multi-task deep learning architectures. Our approach starts with a thin multi-layer network and dynamically widens it in a greedy manner during training. By doing so iteratively. it creates a tree-like deep architecture. on which similar tasks reside in the same branch until at the top layers. Evaluation on person attributes classification tasks involving facial and clothing attributes suggests that the models produced by the proposed method are fast. compact and can closely match or exceed the state-of-the-art accuracy from strong baselines by much more expensive models.,True,ORPxbV4AAAAJ:rPbfW60zdgkC,221,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lu_Fully-Adaptive_Feature_Sharing_CVPR_2017_paper.html,183343417795270167,/scholar?cites=183343417795270167,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Lu_Fully-Adaptive_Feature_Sharing_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf,0,0,0

However. the high demand for computing resources in training such models hinders their application in practice. In order to alleviate this resource hunger in large-scale model training. we propose a Patient Knowledge Distillation approach to compress an original large model (teacher) into an equally-effective lightweight shallow network (student). Different from previous knowledge distillation methods. which only use the output from the last layer of the teacher network for distillation. our student model patiently learns from multiple intermediate layers of the teacher model for incremental knowledge extraction. following two strategies:() PKD-Last: learning from the last  layers; and () PKD-Skip: learning from every  layers. These two patient distillation schemes enable the exploitation of rich information in the teacher's hidden layers. and encourage the student model to patiently learn from and imitate the teacher through a multi-layer distillation process.

Fitting these models by maximizing the marginal likelihood or evidence is typically intractable. thus a common approximation is to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) instead. However. maximum likelihood training (whether exact or approximate) does not necessarily result in a good latent representation. as we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically. In particular. we derive variational lower and upper bounds on the mutual information between the input and the latent variable. and use these bounds to derive a rate-distortion curve that characterizes the tradeoff between compression and reconstruction accuracy. Using this framework. we demonstrate that there is a family of models with identical ELBO. but different quantitative and qualitative characteristics.

To establish tractable and scalable objectives. recent work has turned to variational bounds parameterized by neural networks. However. the relationships and tradeoffs between these bounds remains unclear. In this work. we unify these recent developments in a single framework. We find that the existing variational lower bounds degrade when the MI is large. exhibiting either high bias or high variance.

We unify these disparate approaches by maintaining an independent Hessian approximation for each contributing function in the sum. We maintain computational tractability and limit memory requirements even for high dimensional optimization problems by storing and manipulating these quadratic approximations in a shared. time evolving. low dimensional subspace. This algorithm contrasts with earlier stochastic second order techniques that treat the Hessian of each contributing function as a noisy approximation to the full Hessian. rather than as a target for direct estimation. Each update step requires only a single contributing function or minibatch evaluation (as in SGD). and each step is scaled using an approximate inverse Hessian and little to no adjustment of hyperparameters is required (as is typical for quasi-Newton methods).

Despite its success. the influence of different view choices has been less studied. In this paper. we use empirical analysis to better understand the importance of view selection. and argue that we should reduce the mutual information (MI) between views while keeping task-relevant information intact. To verify this hypothesis. we devise unsupervised and semi-supervised frameworks that learn effective views by aiming to reduce their MI. We also consider data augmentation as a way to reduce MI. and show that increasing data augmentation indeed leads to decreasing MI and improves downstream classification accuracy.

Different deployments exhibit various constraints. such as energy limitations. opportunities. such as the knowledge of the physical location of the nodes in certain scenarios. and requirements. such as real-time or multi-cast communication.

Ltd.,Scheduling coarse‐grain tasks. e.g. metaprograms on a grid. uses estimation of the execution times of individual components to compute optimal schedules. Various factors (hazards) lead to estimation errors. which affect both the performance of the schedule and its resource utilization. We introduce the concept of robustness of a schedule and present an analysis technique to determine the chance that a metaprogram exceeds its execution time due to components outside its critical path. The results of this analysis are used to compute schedules less sensitive to hazards. This translates into more accurate reservation requirements for critical systems. and reduced expected execution time for non‐critical metaprograms executed repeatedly.

In this paper we present a novel method for real-time camera tracking and 3D reconstruction of static indoor environments using an RGB-D sensor. We show that by representing the geometry with a signed distance function (SDF). the camera pose can be efficiently estimated by directly minimizing the error of the depth images on the SDF. As the SDF contains the distances to the surface for each voxel. the pose optimization can be carried out extremely fast. By iteratively estimating the camera poses and integrating the RGB-D data in the voxel grid. a detailed reconstruction of an indoor environment can be achieved. We present reconstructions of several rooms using a hand-held sensor and from onboard an autonomous quadrocopter.

Therefore. fast and accurate image matching is very crucial for 3D reconstruction. In this paper. we proposed a Cascade Hashing strategy to speed up the image matching.

Whether such declines reduce crop yields. or are mitigated by managed pollinators such as honey bees. is unclear. We found universally positive associations of fruit set with flower visitation by wild insects in 41 crop systems worldwide. In contrast. fruit set increased significantly with flower visitation by honey bees in only 14% of the systems surveyed.

There is an ongoing debate whether land for nature and for production should be segregated (land sparing) or integrated on the same land (land sharing. wildlife-friendly farming). While recent studies argue for agricultural intensification in a land sparing approach. we suggest here that it fails to account for real-world complexity. We argue that agriculture practiced under smallholder farmer-dominated landscapes and not large-scale farming. is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world. Furthermore. contemporary food usage is inefficient with one third wasted and a further third used inefficiently to feed livestock and that conventional intensification causes often overlooked environmental costs.

The authors qualify their conclusion. saying that it hinges on proper implementation and may not be transferable and that intensification—increasing the harvest yield—could be achieved through higher inputs of knowledge and labor rather than chemicals. These and other considerations severely limit land sparing in practice. First. many countries lack the means to effectively protect areas but do have a long record of sustainable land sharing (1. 2). Second. situations exist where both yields and biodiversity are high (3) or where biodiversity depends on agriculture (4). Third. vast regions with shallow soils or low rainfall are only suitable for non-intensive use (5). Ironically. where intensification without chemicals is possible. this comes very close to land sharing—namely. knowledgeintensive agroecological systems with multiple crops and a complex structure.The debate about land sparing versus land sharing is poorly framed as a black-and-white choice that must be made to feed the world’s people. In fact. the choice is not between one and the other (6. 7). nor does a higher quantity of food guarantee less hunger.

Unlike traditional schemes. which transport electricity over long distances and through complex electricity transportation meshes. our proposed model achieves demand response by providing incentives to discharging PHEVs to balance local electricity demand out of their own self-interests. However. since transaction security and privacy protection issues present serious challenges. we explore a promising consortium blockchain technology to improve transaction security without reliance on a trusted third party.

1279013,El-gan: Embedding loss driven generative adversarial networks for lane detection,2018,Mohsen Ghafoorian and Cedric Nugteren and Nóra Baka and Olaf Booij and Michael Hofmann,,,,0-0,,Convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to semantic segmentation problems. However. there are many problems that are inherently not pixel-wise classification problems but are nevertheless frequently formulated as semantic segmentation. This illposed formulation consequently necessitates hand-crafted scenario-specific and computationally expensive post-processing methods to convert the per pixel probability maps to final desired outputs. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to make the semantic segmentation network output to be more realistic or better structure-preserving. decreasing the dependency on potentially complex post-processing. In this work. we propose EL-GAN: a GAN framework to mitigate the discussed problem using an embedding loss. With EL-GAN. we discriminate based on learned embeddings of both the labels and the prediction at the same time. This results in much more stable training due to having better discriminative information. benefiting from seeing both ‘fake’and ‘real’predictions at the same time. This substantially stabilizes the adversarial training process. We use the TuSimple lane marking challenge to demonstrate that with our proposed framework it is viable to overcome the inherent anomalies of posing it as a semantic segmentation problem. Not only is the output considerably more similar to the labels when compared to conventional methods. the subsequent post-processing is also simpler and crosses the competitive 96% accuracy threshold.,True,989WL-wAAAAJ:TesyEGJKHF4C,69,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_eccv_2018_workshops/w2/html/Ghafoorian_EL-GAN_Embedding_Loss_Driven_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_for_Lane_Detection_ECCVW_2018_paper.html,16799934113335539555,/scholar?cites=16799934113335539555,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCVW_2018/papers/11129/Ghafoorian_EL-GAN_Embedding_Loss_Driven_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_for_Lane_Detection_ECCVW_2018_paper.pdf,0,0,0

We demonstrate the utility of this mega-analytic approach by identifying the effects of age and gender on the resting state networks of 603 healthy adolescents and adults (mean age: 23.4 years. range: 12 to 71 years). Data were collected on the same scanner. preprocessed using an automated analysis pipeline based in SPM. and studied using group independent component analysis. Resting state networks were identified and evaluated in terms of three primary outcome measures: time course spectral power. spatial map intensity. and functional network connectivity. Results revealed robust effects of age on all three outcome measures. largely indicating decreases in network coherence and connectivity with increasing age. Gender effects were of smaller magnitude but suggested stronger intra-network connectivity in females and more inter-network connectivity in males. particularly with regard to sensorimotor networks.

Participants performed a Posner-type task in which an endogenous cue predicted target location on 70% of trials. while motivation was manipulated by varying magnitude and valence of a cash incentive linked to task performance. Our findings revealed increased detection performance (d’) as a function of incentive value. In parallel. brain signals revealed that increases in absolute incentive magnitude led to cue- and target-specific response modulations that were independent of sustained state effects across visual cortex. fronto-parietal regions. and subcortical regions. Interestingly. state-like effects of incentive were observed in several of these brain regions. too. suggesting that both transient and sustained fMRI signals may contribute to task performance. For both cue and block periods. the effects of administering incentives were correlated with individual trait measures of reward sensitivity. Taken together. our findings support the notion that motivation improves behavioral performance in a demanding attention task by enhancing evoked responses across a distributed set of anatomical sites. many of which have been previously implicated in attentional processing. However. the effect of motivation was not simply additive as the impact of absolute incentive was greater during invalid than valid trials in several brain regions. possibly because motivation had a larger effect on reorienting than orienting …,True,4YqGbnQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,292,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.09.004.2009/full,2296742837223979835,/scholar?cites=2296742837223979835,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.09.004.2009/full,0,0,0

More specifically. in this study we examine the effect of severe prematurity on the spatial location of the visual. temporal. motor. basal ganglia. and the default mode networks. the temporal response properties of each of these networks. and the functional connectivity between them. Our results suggest that the anatomical locations of the RSNs are well developed by 18 months of age and their spatial locations are not distinguishable between premature and term born infants at 18 months or at 36 months. with the exception of small spatial differences noted in the basal ganglia area and the visual cortex. The two major differences between term and preterm children were present at 36 but not 18 months and include: 1) increased spectral energy in the low frequency range (0.01 – 0.06 Hz) for pre-term children in the basal ganglia component. and 2) stronger connectivity between RSNs in term children.

Like rectified linear units (ReLUs). leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs). ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However. ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs. ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values. too. they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore. ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input. while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments. ELUs lead not only to faster learning. but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100. without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging.

MOPS: mixture of Poissons for discovering copy number variations in next-generation sequencing data with a low false discovery rate,2012,Günter Klambauer and Karin Schwarzbauer and Andreas Mayr and Djork-Arne Clevert and Andreas Mitterecker and Ulrich Bodenhofer and Sepp Hochreiter,40,Nucleic acids research,9,e69-e69,Oxford University Press,Quantitative analyses of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. such as the detection of copy number variations (CNVs). remain challenging. Current methods detect CNVs as changes in the depth of coverage along chromosomes. Technological or genomic variations in the depth of coverage thus lead to a high false discovery rate (FDR). even upon correction for GC content. In the context of association studies between CNVs and disease. a high FDR means many false CNVs. thereby decreasing the discovery power of the study after correction for multiple testing. We propose ‘Copy Number estimation by a Mixture Of PoissonS’ (cn.MOPS). a data processing pipeline for CNV detection in NGS data. In contrast to previous approaches. cn.MOPS incorporates modeling of depths of coverage across samples at each genomic position.

FABIA is based on a multiplicative model. which accounts for linear dependencies between gene expression and conditions. and also captures heavy-tailed distributions as observed in real-world transcriptomic data. The generative framework allows to utilize well-founded model selection methods and to apply Bayesian techniques.

However. due to (1) the lack of large-scale studies.

To avoid false positive results. it is therefore critical to select the informative genes from the large noisy data before the actual analysis. Most currently available filtering techniques are supervised and therefore suffer from a potential risk of overfitting. The unsupervised filtering techniques. on the other hand. are either not very efficient or too stringent as they may mix up signal with noise. We propose to use the multiple probes measuring the same target mRNA as repeated measures to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of that specific probe set.

Most of this work relies on defining clever feature representations. in which the chemical graph structure is encoded in a uniform way such that predictions across chemical space can be made. In this work. we propose to exploit the powerful ability of deep neural networks to learn a feature representation from low-level encodings of a huge corpus of chemical structures.

In the past few years there have been many studies claiming GPUs deliver substantial speedups (between 10X and 1000X) over multi-core CPUs on these kernels. To understand where such large performance difference comes from. we perform a rigorous performance analysis and find that after applying optimizations appropriate for both CPUs and GPUs the performance gap between an Nvidia GTX280 processor and the Intel Core i7-960 processor narrows to only 2.5 x on average.

Our approach extends the notion of velocity obstacles from robotics and formulates the conditions for collision free navigation as a quadratic optimization problem. We use a discrete optimization method to efficiently compute the motion of each agent. This resulting algorithm can be parallelized by exploiting data-parallelism and thread-level parallelism. The overall approach. ClearPath. is general and can robustly handle dense scenarios with tens or hundreds of thousands of heterogeneous agents in a few milli-seconds.

As computer architectures evolve. the best join algorithm may change hand. This paper re-examines two popular join algorithms -- hash join and sort-merge join -- to determine if the latest computer architecture trends shift the tide that has favored hash join for many years. For a fair comparison. we implemented the most optimized parallel version of both algorithms on the latest Intel Core i7 platform. Both implementations scale well with the number of cores in the system and take advantages of latest processor features for performance. Our hash-based implementation achieves more than 100M tuples per second which is 17X faster than the best reported performance on CPUs and 8X faster than that reported for GPUs.

The bandwidth-to-compute requirement for a large class of stencil kernels is very high. and their performance is bound by the available memory bandwidth. Since memory bandwidth grows slower than compute. the performance of stencil kernels will not scale with increasing compute density. We present a novel 3.5D-blocking algorithm that performs 2.5D-spatial and temporal blocking of the input grid into on-chip memory for both CPUs and GPUs. The resultant algorithm is amenable to both thread- level and data-level parallelism. and scales near-linearly with the SIMD width and multiple-cores.

The goal is to build a computational model to automatically predict human perceived image quality without a reference image and without knowing the distortion present in the image. Previous approaches for this problem typically rely on hand-crafted features which are carefully designed based on prior knowledge. In contrast. we use raw-image-patches extracted from a set of unlabeled images to learn a dictionary in an unsupervised manner. We use soft-assignment coding with max pooling to obtain effective image representations for quality estimation. The proposed algorithm is very computationally appealing. using raw image patches as local descriptors and using soft-assignment for encoding.

The method employs an edge-based connected component approach and automatically determines a threshold for each component. It has several advantages over existing binarization methods. Firstly. it can handle documents with multi-colored texts with different background shades. Secondly. the method is applicable to documents having text of widely varying sizes. usually not handled by local binarization methods. Thirdly. the method automatically computes the threshold for binarization and the logic for inverting the output from the image data and does not require any input parameter.

1279087,Sharpness Estimation for Document and Scene Images,2012,Jayant Kumar and Francine Chen and David Doermann,,,,,,Images of document pages have different characteristics than images of natural scenes. and so the sharpness measures developed for natural scene images do not necessarily extend to document images primarily composed of text. We present an efficient and simple method for effectively estimating the sharp-ness/blurriness of document images that also performs well on natural scenes. Our method can be used to predict the sharpness in scenarios where images are blurred due to camera-motion (or hand-shake). defocus. or inherent properties of the imaging system. The proposed method outperforms the perceptually-based. no-reference sharpness work of [1] and [4]. which was shown to perform better than 14 other no-reference sharpness measures on the LIVE dataset.,True,23b1se4AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,83,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6460868/,10867033309830862668,/scholar?cites=10867033309830862668,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.363.2130&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1279088,Real-time No-Reference Image Quality Assessment based on Filter Learning,2013,Peng Ye and Jayant Kumar and Le Kang and David Doermann,,,,,,This paper addresses the problem of general-purpose No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) with the goal of developing a real-time. cross-domain model that can predict the quality of distorted images without prior knowledge of non-distorted reference images and types of distortions present in these images. The contributions of our work are two-fold: first. the proposed method is highly efficient. NR-IQA measures are often used in real-time imaging or communication systems. therefore it is important to have a fast NR-IQA algorithm that can be used in these real-time applications. Second. the proposed method has the potential to be used in multiple image domains. Previous work on NR-IQA focus primarily on predicting quality of natural scene image with respect to human perception. yet. in other image domains. the final receiver of a digital image may not be a human. The proposed method consists of the following components:(1) a local feature extractor;(2) a global feature extractor and (3) a regression model. While previous approaches usually treat local feature extraction and regression model training independently. we propose a supervised method based on back-projection. which links the two steps by learning a compact set of filters which can be applied to local image patches to obtain discriminative local features. Using a small set of filters. the proposed method is extremely fast. We have tested this method on various natural scene and document image datasets and obtained stateof-the-art results.,True,23b1se4AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,79,https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2013/html/Ye_Real-Time_No-Reference_Image_2013_CVPR_paper.html,4962948329459392889,/scholar?cites=4962948329459392889,,,https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2013/papers/Ye_Real-Time_No-Reference_Image_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Our approach consists of two steps-Coarse text line estimation using primary components which define the line and assignment of diacritic components which are more difficult to associate with a given line. We first estimate local orientation at each primary component to build a sparse similarity graph. We then. use a shortest path algorithm to compute similarities between non-neighboring components. From this graph. we obtain coarse text lines using two estimates obtained from Affinity propagation and Breadth-first search. In the second step. we assign secondary components to each text line.

In recent decades. earlier diagnosis and better adjuvant therapy have substantially improved patient outcome. Diagnosis by histopathology has proven to be instrumental to guide breast cancer treatment. but new challenges have emerged as our increasing understanding of cancer over the years has revealed its complex nature. As patient demand for personalized breast cancer therapy grows. we face an urgent need for more precise biomarker assessment and more accurate histopathologic breast cancer diagnosis to make better therapy decisions. The digitization of pathology data has opened the door to faster. more reproducible. and more precise diagnoses through computerized image analysis.

While a mixture of linear classifiers is capable of modelling this non-linearity. learning this mixture from weakly annotated data is non-trivial and is the paper’s focus. Our approach is to identify the modes in the distribution of our positive examples by clustering. and to utilize this clustering in a latent SVM formulation to learn the mixture model. The clustering relies on a robust measure of visual similarity which suppresses uninformative clutter by using a novel representation based on the exemplar SVM.

1279135,Adversarial network embedding,2018,Quanyu Dai and Qiang Li and Jian Tang and Dan Wang,32,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,,,Learning low-dimensional representations of networks has proved effective in a variety of tasks such as node classification. link prediction and network visualization. Existing methods can effectively encode different structural properties into the representations. such as neighborhood connectivity patterns. global structural role similarities and other high-order proximities. However. except for objectives to capture network structural properties. most of them suffer from lack of additional constraints for enhancing the robustness of representations. In this paper. we aim to exploit the strengths of generative adversarial networks in capturing latent features. and investigate its contribution in learning stable and robust graph representations. Specifically. we propose an Adversarial Network Embedding (ANE) framework. which leverages the adversarial learning principle to regularize the representation learning. It consists of two components. ie. a structure preserving component and an adversarial learning component. The former component aims to capture network structural properties. while the latter contributes to learning robust representations by matching the posterior distribution of the latent representations to given priors. As shown by the empirical results. our method is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark network embedding tasks.,True,1ir6WUEAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC,139,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11865,16480496424035302464,/scholar?cites=16480496424035302464,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/11865/11724,0,0,0

DSNs are dynamic in the sense that they allow addition and deletion of sensor nodes after deployment to grow the network or replace failing and unreliable nodes.

However. establishing such security associations. with or without trusted third parties. requires reliance on routing layer security. In this paper. we eliminate this apparent cyclic dependency between security services and secure routing in MANETs and show how to bootstrap security for the routing layer. We use the notion of statistically unique and cryptographically verifiable (SUCV) identifiers to implement a secure binding between IP addresses and keys that is independent of any trusted security service.

Initially developed within a classification framework. a lot of extension are now being proposed to handle multimedia applications. This paper provides algorithms within a statistical framework to extend active learning for online content-based image retrieval (CBIR). The classification framework is presented with experiments to compare several powerful classification techniques in this information retrieval context. Focusing on interactive methods. active learning strategy is then described. The limitations of this approach for CBIR are emphasized before presenting our new active selection process RETIN. First. as any active method is sensitive to the boundary estimation between classes. the RETIN strategy carries out a boundary correction to make the retrieval process more robust.

1279157,MUREL: Multimodal Relational Reasoning for Visual Question Answering,2019,Remi Cadene and Hedi Ben-Younes and Matthieu Cord and Nicolas Thome,,,,,,Multimodal attentional networks are currently state-of-the-art models for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks involving real images. Although attention allows to focus on the visual content relevant to the question. this simple mechanism is arguably insufficient to model complex reasoning features required for VQA or other high-level tasks. In this paper. we propose MuRel. a multimodal relational network which is learned end-to-end to reason over real images. Our first contribution is the introduction of the MuRel cell. an atomic reasoning primitive representing interactions between question and image regions by a rich vectorial representation. and modeling region relations with pairwise combinations. Secondly. we incorporate the cell into a full MuRel network. which progressively refines visual and question interactions. and can be leveraged to define visualization schemes finer than mere attention maps. We validate the relevance of our approach with various ablation studies. and show its superiority to attention-based methods on three datasets: VQA 2.0. VQA-CP v2 and TDIUC. Our final MuRel network is competitive to or outperforms state-of-the-art results in this challenging context.

1279161,On Using Very Large Target Vocabulary for Neural Machine Translation,2014,Sébastien Jean and Kyunghyun Cho and Roland Memisevic and Yoshua Bengio,,,,,,Neural machine translation. a recently proposed approach to machine translation based purely on neural networks. has shown promising results compared to the existing approaches such as phrase-based statistical machine translation. Despite its recent success. neural machine translation has its limitation in handling a larger vocabulary. as training complexity as well as decoding complexity increase proportionally to the number of target words. In this paper. we propose a method that allows us to use a very large target vocabulary without increasing training complexity. based on importance sampling. We show that decoding can be efficiently done even with the model having a very large target vocabulary by selecting only a small subset of the whole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach are empirically found to outperform the baseline models with a small vocabulary as well as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models. Furthermore. when we use the ensemble of a few models with very large target vocabularies. we achieve the state-of-the-art translation performance (measured by BLEU) on the English-> German translation and almost as high performance as state-of-the-art English-> French translation system.,True,8oJl5P0AAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC,876,https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2007,13222564911222792417,/scholar?cites=13222564911222792417,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.2007,0,0,0

Since most of the computation in training neural networks is typically spent on floating point multiplications. we investigate an approach to training that eliminates the need for most of these. Our method consists of two parts: First we stochastically binarize weights to convert multiplications involved in computing hidden states to sign changes. Second. while back-propagating error derivatives. in addition to binarizing the weights. we quantize the representations at each layer to convert the remaining multiplications into binary shifts. Experimental results across 3 popular datasets (MNIST. CIFAR10.

Memisevic and Hinton  introduced three-way multiplicative interactions that use the intensity of a pixel in the first image as a multiplicative gain on a learned. symmetric weight between a pixel in the second image and a hidden unit. This creates cubically many parameters. which form a three-dimensional interaction tensor. We describe a low-rank approximation to this interaction tensor that uses a sum of factors. each of which is a three-way outer product. This approximation allows efficient learning of transformations between larger image patches.

1279173,Ccnet: Criss-cross attention for semantic segmentation,2020,Zilong Huang and Xinggang Wang and Lichao Huang and Chang Huang and Yunchao Wei and Wenyu Liu,,,,,,Full-image dependencies provide useful contextual information to benefit visual understanding problems. In this work. we propose a Criss-Cross Network (CCNet) for obtaining such contextual information in a more effective and efficient way. Concretely. for each pixel. a novel criss-cross attention module in CCNet harvests the contextual information of all the pixels on its criss-cross path. By taking a further recurrent operation. each pixel can finally capture the full-image dependencies from all pixels. Overall. CCNet is with the following merits: 1) GPU memory friendly. Compared with the non-local block. the proposed recurrent criss-cross attention module requires 11x less GPU memory usage. 2) High computational efficiency. The recurrent criss-cross attention significantly reduces FLOPs by about 85% of the non-local block in computing full-image dependencies. 3) The state-of-the-art performance.

1279174,Deepcontour: A deep convolutional feature learned by positive-sharing loss for contour detection,2015,Wei Shen and Xinggang Wang and Yan Wang and Xiang Bai and Zhijiang Zhang,,,,3982-3991,,Contour detection serves as the basis of a variety of computer vision tasks such as image segmentation and object recognition. The mainstream works to address this problem focus on designing engineered gradient features. In this work. we show that contour detection accuracy can be improved by instead making the use of the deep features learned from convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While rather than using the networks as a blackbox feature extractor. we customize the training strategy by partitioning contour (positive) data into subclasses and fitting each subclass by different model parameters. A new loss function. named positive-sharing loss. in which each subclass shares the loss for the whole positive class. is proposed to learn the parameters. Compared to the sofmax loss function. the proposed one. introduces an extra regularizer to emphasizes the losses for the positive and negative classes. which facilitates to explore more discriminative features.

In the task of instance segmentation. the confidence of instance classification is used as mask quality score in most instance segmentation frameworks. However. the mask quality. quantified as the IoU between the instance mask and its ground truth. is usually not well correlated with classification score. In this paper. we study this problem and propose Mask Scoring R-CNN which contains a network block to learn the quality of the predicted instance masks. The proposed network block takes the instance feature and the corresponding predicted mask together to regress the mask IoU. The mask scoring strategy calibrates the misalignment between mask quality and mask score. and improves instance segmentation performance by prioritizing more accurate mask predictions during COCO AP evaluation. By extensive evaluations on the COCO dataset. Mask Scoring R-CNN brings consistent and noticeable gain with different models and outperforms the state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN.

Based on deep learning. weakly supervised detectors have achieved many promising results. However. compared with fully supervised detection. it is more challenging to train deep network based detectors in a weakly supervised manner. Here we formulate weakly supervised detection as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. where instance classifiers (object detectors) are put into the network as hidden nodes. We propose a novel online instance classifier refinement algorithm to integrate MIL and the instance classifier refinement procedure into a single deep network. and train the network end-to-end with only image-level supervision. ie. without object location information. More precisely. instance labels inferred from weak supervision are propagated to their spatially overlapped instances to refine instance classifier online. The iterative instance classifier refinement procedure is implemented using multiple streams in deep network. where each stream supervises its latter stream.

Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a range of challenging environments. but the proliferation of algorithms makes it difficult to discern which particular approach would be best suited for a rich. diverse task like grasping. To answer this question. we propose a simulated benchmark for robotic grasping that emphasizes off-policy learning and generalization to unseen objects. Off-policy learning enables utilization of grasping data over a wide variety of objects. and diversity is important to enable the method to generalize to new objects that were not seen during training.

In practical settings. such as robotics. this involves repeatedly attempting a task. resetting the environment between each attempt. However. not all tasks are easily or automatically reversible. In practice. this learning process requires extensive human intervention. In this work. we propose an autonomous method for safe and efficient reinforcement learning that simultaneously learns a forward and reset policy. with the reset policy resetting the environment for a subsequent attempt. By learning a value function for the reset policy. we can automatically determine when the forward policy is about to enter a non-reversible state. providing for uncertainty-aware safety aborts. Our experiments illustrate that proper use of the reset policy can greatly reduce the number of manual resets required to learn a task. can reduce the number of unsafe actions that lead to non-reversible states. and can automatically induce a curriculum.,True,l-la0GQAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,58,https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06782,12404374759487598393,/scholar?cites=12404374759487598393,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06782,0,0,0

Heidelberg,Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is one of the well-known features for object recognition. HOG features are calculated by taking orientation histograms of edge intensity in a local region. N.Dalal et al. proposed an object detection algorithm in which HOG features were extracted from all locations of a dense grid on a image region and the combined features are classified by using linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this paper. we employ HOG features extracted from all locations of a grid on the image as candidates of the feature vectors.

Nevertheless. several recent results suggest that data-driven approaches are feasible and quite promising.

1279233,Towards an automatic turing test: Learning to evaluate dialogue responses,2017,Ryan Lowe and Michael Noseworthy and Iulian V Serban and Nicolas Angelard-Gontier and Yoshua Bengio and Joelle Pineau,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07149,,,,Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for unstructured domains is a challenging problem. Unfortunately. existing automatic evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of response quality. Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation procedure is crucial for dialogue research. as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to this challenge. we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem. We present an evaluation model (ADEM) that learns to predict human-like scores to input responses. using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that the ADEM model's predictions correlate significantly. and at a level much higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU. with human judgements at both the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating dialogue models unseen during training. an important step for automatic dialogue evaluation.,True,0g31OfAAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,225,https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07149,15470106720904286429,/scholar?cites=15470106720904286429,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07149,0,0,0

The models extend the sequence-to-sequence framework to generate two parallel stochastic processes: a sequence of high-level coarse tokens. and a sequence of natural language words (eg sentences). The coarse sequences follow a latent stochastic process with a factorial representation. which helps the models generalize to new examples. The coarse sequences can also incorporate task-specific knowledge. when available. In our experiments. the coarse sequences are extracted using automatic procedures. which are designed to capture compositional structure and semantics. These procedures enable training the multiresolution recurrent neural networks by maximizing the exact joint log-likelihood over both sequences. We apply the models to dialogue response generation in the technical support domain and compare them with several competing models. The multiresolution recurrent neural networks outperform competing models by a substantial margin. achieving state-of-the-art results according to both a human evaluation study and automatic evaluation metrics.

For aligning reads with up to four mismatches. SOAP3 aligns slightly more reads than BWA and Bowtie; this is because SOAP3. unlike BWA and Bowtie. is not heuristic-based and always reports all answers.

In computer vision. the absorption and scattering processes are commonly modeled by a linear combination of the direct attenuation and the airlight.

To our knowledge. all methods that use a single input image require explicit color segmentation to deal with multicolored surfaces. Unfortunately. for complex textured images. current color segmentation algorithms are still problematic to segment correctly. Consequently. a method without explicit color segmentation becomes indispensable. and this chapter presents such a method. The method is based solely on colors. particularly chromaticity. without requiring any geometrical information.

Rain streaks impair visibility of an image and introduce undesirable interference that can severely affect the performance of computer vision algorithms. Rain streak removal can be formulated as a layer decomposition problem. with a rain streak layer superimposed on a background layer containing the true scene content. Existing decomposition methods that address this problem employ either dictionary learning methods or impose a low rank structure on the appearance of the rain streaks. While these methods can improve the overall visibility. they tend to leave too many rain streaks in the background image or over-smooth the background image. In this paper. we propose an effective method that uses simple patch-based priors for both the background and rain layers. These priors are based on Gaussian mixture models and can accommodate multiple orientations and scales of the rain streaks. This simple approach removes rain streaks better than the existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Our core ideas lie in our new rain image model and new deep learning architecture. We add a binary map that provides rain streak locations to an existing model. which comprises a rain streak layer and a background layer. We create a model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation (where individual streaks cannot be seen. and thus visually similar to mist or fog). and another component representing various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks. which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the model. we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the binary rain streak map. the appearance of rain streaks. and the clean background. which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is critically beneficial. since its loss function can provide additional strong information to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again. a phenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks. we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal network that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation iteratively and progressively. In each recurrence of our method. a new contextualized dilated network is developed to exploit regional contextual information and to produce better representations for rain detection.

In this paper. we address the problem by visually removing raindrops. and thus transforming a raindrop degraded image into a clean one. The problem is intractable. since first the regions occluded by raindrops are not given. Second. the information about the background scene of the occluded regions is completely lost for most part. To resolve the problem. we apply an attentive generative network using adversarial training. Our main idea is to inject visual attention into both the generative and discriminative networks. During the training. our visual attention learns about raindrop regions and their surroundings. Hence. by injecting this information. the generative network will pay more attention to the raindrop regions and the surrounding structures. and the discriminative network will be able to assess the local consistency of the restored regions. This injection of visual attention to both generative and discriminative networks is the main contribution of this paper.

Statistics-based methods require many surface colors and become error prone when there are only a few surface colors. In contrast. dichromatic-based methods can successfully handle uniformly colored surfaces but cannot be applied to highly textured surfaces. since they require precise color segmentation.

1279256,Nighttime haze removal with glow and multiple light colors,2015,Yu Li and Robby T Tan and Michael S Brown,,,,226-234,,This paper focuses on dehazing nighttime images. Most existing dehazing methods use models that are formulated to describe haze in daytime. Daytime models assume a single uniform light color attributed to a light source not directly visible in the scene. Nighttime scenes. however. commonly include visible lights sources with varying colors. These light sources also often introduce noticeable amounts of glow that is not present in daytime haze. To address these effects. we introduce a new nighttime haze model that accounts for the varying light sources and their glow. Our model is a linear combination of three terms: the direct transmission. airlight and glow. The glow term represents light from the light sources that is scattered around before reaching the camera. Based on the model. we propose a framework that first reduces the effect of the glow in the image. resulting in a nighttime image that consists of direct transmission and airlight only. We then compute a spatially varying atmospheric light map that encodes light colors locally. This atmospheric map is used to predict the transmission. which we use to obtain our nighttime scene reflection image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our nighttime haze model and correction method on a number of examples and compare our results with existing daytime and nighttime dehazing methods' results.,True,MOD0gv4AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,128,https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/html/Li_Nighttime_Haze_Removal_ICCV_2015_paper.html,4322878443020855291,/scholar?cites=4322878443020855291,,,https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Li_Nighttime_Haze_Removal_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf,0,0,0

However. in the real world. the presence of specular reflections is inevitable since there are many dielectric inhomogeneous objects which have both diffuse and specular reflections. To resolve this problem. we present a method to separate the two reflection components. The method is principally based on the distribution of specular and diffuse points in a two-dimensional maximum chromaticity-intensity space. We found that. by utilizing the space and known illumination color. the problem of reflection component separation can be simplified into the problem of identifying diffuse maximum chromaticity. To be able to identity the diffuse maximum chromaticity correctly. an analysis of the noise is required since most real images suffer from it.

The most successful protein structure prediction methods make use of a divide-and-conquer strategy to attack the problem: a conformational sampling method generates plausible candidate structures. which are subsequently accepted or rejected using an energy function. Conceptually. this often corresponds to separating local structural bias from the long-range interactions that stabilize the compact. native state. However. sampling protein conformations that are compatible with the local structural bias encoded in a given protein sequence is a long-standing open problem. especially in continuous space.

As is the case for proteins. RNA 3-D structure prediction methods require two key ingredients: an accurate energy function and a conformational sampling procedure. Both are only partly solved problems. Here. we focus on the problem of conformational sampling. The current state of the art solution is based on fragment assembly methods. which construct plausible conformations by stringing together short fragments obtained from experimental structures. However. the discrete nature of the fragments necessitates the use of carefully tuned. unphysical energy functions. and their non-probabilistic nature impairs unbiased sampling. We offer a solution to the sampling problem that removes these important limitations: a probabilistic model of RNA structure that allows efficient sampling of RNA conformations in continuous space. and with associated probabilities. We show that the model captures several key features of RNA structure. such as its rotameric nature and the distribution of the helix lengths. Furthermore. the model readily generates native-like 3-D conformations for 9 out of 10 test structures. solely using coarse-grained base-pairing information.

For about two decades. knowledge-based potentials based on pairwise distances – so-called “potentials of mean force” (PMFs) – have been center stage in the prediction and design of protein structure and the simulation of protein folding. However. the validity. scope and limitations of these potentials are still vigorously debated and disputed. and the optimal choice of the reference state – a necessary component of these potentials – is an unsolved problem. PMFs are loosely justified by analogy to the reversible work theorem in statistical physics. or by a statistical argument based on a likelihood function. Both justifications are insightful but leave many questions unanswered. Here. we show for the first time that PMFs can be seen as approximations to quantities that do have a rigorous probabilistic justification: they naturally arise when probability distributions over different features of proteins need to be combined. We call these quantities “reference ratio distributions” deriving from the application of the “reference ratio method.” This new view is not only of theoretical relevance but leads to many insights that are of direct practical use: the reference state is uniquely defined and does not require external physical insights; the approach can be generalized beyond pairwise distances to arbitrary features of protein structure; and it becomes clear for which purposes the use of these quantities is justified.

Several saliency methods have been proposed. often guided by visual appeal on image data. In this work. we propose an actionable methodology to evaluate what kinds of explanations a given method can and cannot provide. We find that reliance. solely. on visual assessment can be misleading. Through extensive experiments we show that some existing saliency methods are independent both of the model and of the data generating process. Consequently. methods that fail the proposed tests are inadequate for tasks that are sensitive to either data or model. such as. finding outliers in the data. explaining the relationship between inputs and outputs that the model learned. and debugging the model.

In addition. many systems. such as image classifiers. operate on low-level features rather than high-level concepts. To address these challenges. we introduce Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs). which provide an interpretation of a neural net’s internal state in terms of human-friendly concepts. The key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a neural net as an aid. not an obstacle. We show how to use CAVs as part of a technique. Testing with CAVs (TCAV). that uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree to which a user-defined concept is important to a classification result–for example. how sensitive a prediction of “zebra” is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain of image classification as a testing ground. we describe how CAVs may be used to explore hypotheses and generate insights for a standard image classification network as well as a medical application.,True,Ml_vQ8MAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,431,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/kim18d.html,3851819948477187965,/scholar?cites=3851819948477187965,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/kim18d/kim18d.pdf,0,0,0

In other words. most images in the data distribution are both correctly classified by the model and are very close to a visually similar misclassified image. Despite substantial research interest. the cause of the phenomenon is still poorly understood and remains unsolved. We hypothesize that this counter intuitive behavior is a naturally occurring result of the high dimensional geometry of the data manifold. As a first step towards exploring this hypothesis. we study a simple synthetic dataset of classifying between two concentric high dimensional spheres. For this dataset we show a fundamental tradeoff between the amount of test error and the average distance to nearest error. In particular. we prove that any model which misclassifies a small constant fraction of a sphere will be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of size . Surprisingly. when we train several different architectures on this dataset. all of their error sets naturally approach this theoretical bound. As a result of the theory. the vulnerability of neural networks to small adversarial perturbations is a logical consequence of the amount of test error observed. We hope that our theoretical analysis of this very simple case will point the way forward to explore how the geometry of complex real-world data sets leads to adversarial examples.,True,Ml_vQ8MAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,225,https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02774,16463129449367579533,/scholar?cites=16463129449367579533,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02774,0,0,0

We show the existence of depth scales that naturally limit the maximum depth of signal propagation through these random networks. Our main practical result is to show that random networks may be trained precisely when information can travel through them. Thus. the depth scales that we identify provide bounds on how deep a network may be trained for a specific choice of hyperparameters. As a corollary to this. we argue that in networks at the edge of chaos. one of these depth scales diverges. Thus arbitrarily deep networks may be trained only sufficiently close to criticality. We show that the presence of dropout destroys the order-to-chaos critical point and therefore strongly limits the maximum trainable depth for random networks.

Nonetheless. these systems can be induced to make errors on data that are surprisingly similar to examples the learned system handles correctly. The existence of these errors raises a variety of questions about out-of-sample generalization and whether bad actors might use such examples to abuse deployed systems. As a result of these security concerns. there has been a flurry of recent papers proposing algorithms to defend against such malicious perturbations of correctly handled examples. It is unclear how such misclassifications represent a different kind of security problem than other errors. or even other attacker-produced examples that have no specific relationship to an uncorrupted input. In this paper. we argue that adversarial example defense papers have. to date. mostly considered abstract. toy games that do not relate to any specific security concern. Furthermore. defense papers have not yet precisely described all the abilities and limitations of attackers that would be relevant in practical security. Towards this end. we establish a taxonomy of motivations. constraints. and abilities for more plausible adversaries.

1279286,Residual LSTM: Design of a deep recurrent architecture for distant speech recognition,2017,Jaeyoung Kim and Mostafa El-Khamy and Jungwon Lee,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.03360,,,,In this paper. a novel architecture for a deep recurrent neural network. residual LSTM is introduced. A plain LSTM has an internal memory cell that can learn long term dependencies of sequential data. It also provides a temporal shortcut path to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients in the temporal domain. The residual LSTM provides an additional spatial shortcut path from lower layers for efficient training of deep networks with multiple LSTM layers. Compared with the previous work. highway LSTM. residual LSTM separates a spatial shortcut path with temporal one by using output layers. which can help to avoid a conflict between spatial and temporal-domain gradient flows. Furthermore. residual LSTM reuses the output projection matrix and the output gate of LSTM to control the spatial information flow instead of additional gate networks. which effectively reduces more than 10% of network parameters. An experiment for distant speech recognition on the AMI SDM corpus shows that 10-layer plain and highway LSTM networks presented 13.7% and 6.2% increase in WER over 3-layer aselines. respectively. On the contrary. 10-layer residual LSTM networks provided the lowest WER 41.0%. which corresponds to 3.3% and 2.8% WER reduction over plain and highway LSTM networks. respectively.,True,Cya7Va8AAAAJ:Cjb_BMXg7WwC,126,https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03360,2919953097813007799,/scholar?cites=2919953097813007799,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03360,0,0,0

1279288,Towards the limit of network quantization,2016,Yoojin Choi and Mostafa El-Khamy and Jungwon Lee,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.01543,,,,Network quantization is one of network compression techniques to reduce the redundancy of deep neural networks. It reduces the number of distinct network parameter values by quantization in order to save the storage for them. In this paper. we design network quantization schemes that minimize the performance loss due to quantization given a compression ratio constraint. We analyze the quantitative relation of quantization errors to the neural network loss function and identify that the Hessian-weighted distortion measure is locally the right objective function for the optimization of network quantization. As a result. Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for clustering network parameters to quantize. When optimal variable-length binary codes. eg. Huffman codes. are employed for further compression. we derive that the network quantization problem can be related to the entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) problem in information theory and consequently propose two solutions of ECSQ for network quantization. ie. uniform quantization and an iterative solution similar to Lloyd's algorithm. Finally. using the simple uniform quantization followed by Huffman coding. we show from our experiments that the compression ratios of 51.25. 22.17 and 40.65 are achievable for LeNet. 32-layer ResNet and AlexNet. respectively.,True,Cya7Va8AAAAJ:lDjdc_zZTkYC,104,https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01543,702234881828234409,/scholar?cites=702234881828234409,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01543,0,0,0

While network simulation provides quicker results than full-system simulation. it suffers from inaccuracy in the network traffic characteristics. To increase the fidelity of network simulation. this report describes the implementation of a new trace-based network simulation methodology that captures the dependencies between network messages observed in full-system simulation.

Cham,Feature extraction is an integral of all Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems. Due to the presence of fibroglandular tissue however. measurements are perturbed by unwanted influences and therefore. the same descriptor will yield different values for different amounts of occluding structures. To aid the statistical learning used for classification. we need to design features that are invariant to unwanted influences. In this paper. we propose a simple model of the tumour and its surrounding tissue and show how this model can be used to derive descriptors that are invariant to obscuring tissue. rather than heuristically defining a set of descriptors. which is common practice in many CAD papers. We tailor the descriptors to optimally discriminate between tumours and cysts. by assuming a parametric form of the lesions.

Spatial augmented reality employs data projectors to augment the real world. In this setting. traditional tracking methods fall short due to the interference caused by the projector.

The assumptions are that the channel model is quasi-static and that the base station has perfect channel information. In traditional TDMA or FDMA systems. resource allocation for each user is non-adaptively fixed. and the water-filling power spectrum is known to be optimal. Since the subchannel allocations among the users are not optimized. a group of users is likely to suffer from poor channel gains resulting from large path loss and random fading. To resolve this problem. we derive a multiuser convex optimization problem to find the optimal allocation of subchannels. and propose a low-complexity adaptive subchannel allocation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs almost as well as the optimal solution.

Assuming an independent identically distributed block-fading model with transmitter channel side information. beamforming for each remote user is shown to be necessary for achieving sum-capacity when there is a large number of users in the system. This result stands even in the case where each user is equipped with a large number of transmit antennas. and it can be readily extended to channels with intersymbol interference if an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation is assumed.

The profound benefit of multi-antenna diversity is demonstrated by a dimension counting argument. The optimal power allocation strategy in a system with n transmit antennas for each user and m receive antennas is a combination of successive cancellation and a TDMA-like scheme where in each time slot the rank of the transmit signals r/sub k/ for all users must satisfy /spl Sigma//sub k/r/sub k/(r/sub k/+1)/spl les/m(m+1).

1279331,Convolutional neural networks over tree structures for programming language processing,2016,Lili Mou and Ge Li and Lu Zhang and Tao Wang and Zhi Jin,30,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,,,Programming language processing (similar to natural language processing) is a hot research topic in the field of software engineering; it has also aroused growing interest in the artificial intelligence community. However. different from a natural language sentence. a program contains rich. explicit. and complicated structural information. Hence. traditional NLP models may be inappropriate for programs. In this paper. we propose a novel tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for programming language processing. in which a convolution kernel is designed over programs' abstract syntax trees to capture structural information. TBCNN is a generic architecture for programming language processing; our experiments show its effectiveness in two different program analysis tasks: classifying programs according to functionality. and detecting code snippets of certain patterns. TBCNN outperforms baseline methods. including several neural models for NLP.,True,FHOFCuEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,320,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10139,12324937124370515795,/scholar?cites=12324937124370515795,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/10139/9998,0,0,0
1279332,TBCNN: A tree-based convolutional neural network for programming language processing,2014,Lili Mou and Ge Li and Zhi Jin and Lu Zhang and Tao Wang,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.5718,,,,Deep neural networks have made significant breakthroughs in many fields of artificial intelligence. However. it has not been applied in the field of programming language processing. In this paper. we propose the treebased convolutional neural network (TBCNN) to model programming languages. which contain rich and explicit tree structural information. In our model. program vector representations are learned by the “coding” pretraining criterion based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs); the convolutional layer explicitly captures neighboring features on the tree; with the “binary continuous tree” and “3-way pooling.” our model can deal with ASTs of different shapes and sizes. We evaluate the program vector representations empirically. showing that the coding criterion successfully captures underlying features of AST nodes. and that program vector representations significantly speed up supervised learning. We also compare TBCNN to baseline methods; our model achieves better accuracy in the task of program classification. To our best knowledge. this paper is the first to analyze programs with deep neural networks; we extend the scope of deep learning to the field of programming language processing.

Broadly. there are two major developmental bottlenecks: the unavailability of comprehensively labeled datasets and of expressive evaluation strategies. Approaches for labeling datasets have relied on intensive hand-engineering. and strategies for evaluating learning systems have been unable to identify failure-case scenarios. Human intelligence offers an untapped approach for breaking through these bottlenecks. This paper introduces Driverseat. a technology for embedding crowds around learning systems for autonomous driving. Driverseat utilizes crowd contributions for (a) collecting complex 3D labels and (b) tagging diverse scenarios for ready evaluation of learning systems. We demonstrate how Driverseat can crowdstrap a convolutional neural network on the lane-detection task.

1279337,Data augmentation generative adversarial networks,2017,Antreas Antoniou and Amos Storkey and Harrison Edwards,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.04340,,,,Effective training of neural networks requires much data. In the low-data regime. parameters are underdetermined. and learnt networks generalise poorly. Data Augmentation alleviates this by using existing data more effectively. However standard data augmentation produces only limited plausible alternative data. Given there is potential to generate a much broader set of augmentations. we design and train a generative model to do data augmentation. The model. based on image conditional Generative Adversarial Networks. takes data from a source domain and learns to take any data item and generalise it to generate other within-class data items. As this generative process does not depend on the classes themselves. it can be applied to novel unseen classes of data. We show that a Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Network (DAGAN) augments standard vanilla classifiers well. We also show a DAGAN can enhance few-shot learning systems such as Matching Networks. We demonstrate these approaches on Omniglot. on EMNIST having learnt the DAGAN on Omniglot. and VGG-Face data. In our experiments we can see over 13% increase in accuracy in the low-data regime experiments in Omniglot (from 69% to 82%). EMNIST (73.9% to 76%) and VGG-Face (4.5% to 12%); in Matching Networks for Omniglot we observe an increase of 0.5%(from 96.9% to 97.4%) and an increase of 1.8% in EMNIST (from 59.5% to 61.3%).,True,3Rlc8EAAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC,462,https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04340,9773523094742397382,/scholar?cites=9773523094742397382,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.04340,0,0,0

We find that the random network distillation (RND) bonus combined with this increased flexibility enables significant progress on several hard exploration Atari games. In particular we establish state of the art performance on Montezuma's Revenge. a game famously difficult for deep reinforcement learning methods.

1279341,Censoring Representations with an Adversary,2015,Harrison Edwards and Amos Storkey,,,,,,In practice. there are often explicit constraints on what representations or decisions are acceptable in an application of machine learning. For example it may be a legal requirement that a decision must not favour a particular group. Alternatively it can be that that representation of data must not have identifying information. We address these two related issues by learning flexible representations that minimize the capability of an adversarial critic. This adversary is trying to predict the relevant sensitive variable from the representation. and so minimizing the performance of the adversary ensures there is little or no information in the representation about the sensitive variable. We demonstrate this adversarial approach on two problems: making decisions free from discrimination and removing private information from images. We formulate the adversarial model as a minimax problem. and optimize that minimax objective using a stochastic gradient alternate min-max optimizer. We demonstrate the ability to provide discriminant free representations for standard test problems. and compare with previous state of the art methods for fairness. showing statistically significant improvement across most cases. The flexibility of this method is shown via a novel problem: removing annotations from images. from unaligned training examples of annotated and unannotated images. and with no a priori knowledge of the form of annotation provided to the model.,True,3Rlc8EAAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C,286,https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05897,14450653116005073046,/scholar?cites=14450653116005073046,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05897,0,0,0

For a machine learner. this means understanding the similarities amongst datasets. In order to do this. one must take seriously the idea of working with datasets. rather than datapoints. as the key objects to model. Towards this goal. we demonstrate an extension of a variational autoencoder that can learn a method for computing representations. or statistics. of datasets in an unsupervised fashion. The network is trained to produce statistics that encapsulate a generative model for each dataset. Hence the network enables efficient learning from new datasets for both unsupervised and supervised tasks. We show that we are able to learn statistics that can be used for: clustering datasets. transferring generative models to new datasets. selecting representative samples of datasets and classifying previously unseen classes.

A particularly interesting aspect of the approach is that any existing inference technique in DBNs now becomes available for answering behavioral question--including those on continuous. factorial. or hierarchical state representations. Here we present an Expectation Maximization algorithm for computing optimal policies. Unlike previous approaches we can show that this actually optimizes the discounted expected future return for arbitrary reward functions and without assuming an ad hoc finite total time.

Characterizing the relation between learning rate. batch size and the properties of the final minima. such as width or generalization. remains an open question. In order to tackle this problem we investigate the previously proposed approximation of SGD by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). We theoretically argue that three factors-learning rate. batch size and gradient covariance-influence the minima found by SGD. In particular we find that the ratio of learning rate to batch size is a key determinant of SGD dynamics and of the width of the final minima. and that higher values of the ratio lead to wider minima and often better generalization. We confirm these findings experimentally.

This model sets a new state-of-the art in fixation prediction by achieving top performance in area under the curve metrics on the MIT300 hold-out benchmark (AUC= 88%. sAUC= 77%. NSS= 2.34). The second model uses purely low-level (isotropic contrast) features. This model achieves better performance than all models not using features pre-trained on object recognition. making it a strong baseline to assess the utility of high-level features. We then evaluate and visualize which fixations are better explained by low-level compared to high-level image features. Surprisingly we find that a substantial proportion of fixations are better explained by the simple low-level model than the state-of-the-art model. Comparing different features within the same powerful readout architecture allows us to better understand the relevance of low-versus high-level features in predicting fixation locations. while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art saliency prediction.,True,ADMVEmsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,164,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Kummerer_Understanding_Low-_and_ICCV_2017_paper.html,3496578166879199238,/scholar?cites=3496578166879199238,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Kummerer_Understanding_Low-_and_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Recently. two approaches based on deep learning have emerged for modeling these nonlinear computations: transfer learning from artificial neural networks trained on object recognition and data-driven convolutional neural network models trained end-to-end on large populations of neurons. Here. we test the ability of both approaches to predict spiking activity in response to natural images in V1 of awake monkeys. We found that the transfer learning approach performed similarly well to the data-driven approach and both outperformed classical linear-nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations that build on existing theories of V1. Notably. transfer learning using a pre-trained feature space required substantially less experimental time to achieve the same performance. In conclusion. multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) set the new state of the art for predicting neural responses to natural images in primate V1 and deep features learned for object recognition are better explanations for V1 computation than all previous filter bank theories. This finding strengthens the necessity of V1 models that are multiple nonlinearities away from the image domain and it supports the idea of explaining early visual cortex based on high-level functional goals.,True,ADMVEmsAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,128,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006897,1463533908922810052,/scholar?cites=1463533908922810052,,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006897,0,0,0

Many approaches. eg for state-of-the-art artistic style transfer or natural texture synthesis. rely on the statistics of hierarchical representations in supervisedly trained deep neural networks. It is. however. unclear what aspects of this feature representation are crucial for natural image generation: is it the depth. the pooling or the training of the features on natural images? We here address this question for the task of natural texture synthesis and show that none of the above aspects are indispensable. Instead. we demonstrate that natural textures of high perceptual quality can be generated from networks with only a single layer. no pooling and random filters.,True,ADMVEmsAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,53,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJhZeLsxx,11564137418671603755,/scholar?cites=11564137418671603755,,,,0,0,0

To investigate image features important for texture perception. we psychophysically compare a recent parametric model of texture appearance (convolutional neural network [CNN] model) that uses the features encoded by a deep CNN (VGG-19) with two other models: the venerable Portilla and Simoncelli model and an extension of the CNN model in which the power spectrum is additionally matched. Observers discriminated model-generated textures from original natural textures in a spatial three-alternative oddity paradigm under two viewing conditions: when test patches were briefly presented to the near-periphery (“parafoveal”) and when observers were able to make eye movements to all three patches (“inspection”). Under parafoveal viewing. observers were unable to discriminate 10 of 12 original images from CNN model images. and remarkably. the simpler Portilla and Simoncelli model performed slightly better than the CNN model (11 textures). Under foveal inspection. matching CNN features captured appearance substantially better than the Portilla and Simoncelli model (nine compared to four textures). and including the power spectrum improved appearance matching for two of the three remaining textures. None of the models we test here could produce indiscriminable images for one of the 12 textures under the inspection condition.

Many previous studies aimed to visualize the selectivity of individual units by finding meaningful images that maximize their activation. However. comparably little attention has been paid to visualizing to what image transformations units in DNNs are invariant. Here we propose a method to discover invariances in the responses of hidden layer units of deep neural networks. Our approach is based on simultaneously searching for a batch of images that strongly activate a unit while at the same time being as distinct from each other as possible. We find that even early convolutional layers in VGG-19 exhibit various forms of response invariance: near-perfect phase invariance in some units and invariance to local diffeomorphic transformations in others. At the same time. we uncover representational differences with ResNet-50 in its corresponding layers.

Such difficult categories demand more dedicated classifiers. However. existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are trained as flat N-way classifiers. and few efforts have been made to leverage the hierarchical structure of categories. In this paper. we introduce hierarchical deep CNNs (HD-CNNs) by embedding deep CNNs into a category hierarchy. An HD-CNN separates easy classes using a coarse category classifier while distinguishing difficult classes using fine category classifiers. During HD-CNN training. component-wise pretraining is followed by global finetuning with a multinomial logistic loss regularized by a coarse category consistency term. In addition. conditional executions of fine category classifiers and layer parameter compression make HD-CNNs scalable for large-scale visual recognition. We achieve state-of-the-art results on both CIFAR100 and large-scale ImageNet 1000-class benchmark datasets.

1279481,The medical imaging interaction toolkit,2005,Ivo Wolf and Marcus Vetter and Ingmar Wegner and Thomas Böttger and Marco Nolden and Max Schöbinger and Mark Hastenteufel and Tobias Kunert and Hans-Peter Meinzer,9,Medical image analysis,6,594-604,Elsevier,Thoroughly designed. open-source toolkits emerge to boost progress in medical imaging. The Insight Toolkit (ITK) provides this for the algorithmic scope of medical imaging. especially for segmentation and registration. But medical imaging algorithms have to be clinically applied to be useful. which additionally requires visualization and interaction. The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) has powerful visualization capabilities. but only low-level support for interaction.In this paper. we present the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK).

Berlin. Heidelberg,We present a novel method for the segmentation of volumetric images. which is especially suitable for highly variable soft tissue structures. Core of the algorithm is a statistical shape model (SSM) of the structure of interest. A global search with an evolutionary algorithm is employed to detect suitable initial parameters for the model. which are subsequently optimized by a local search similar to the Active Shape mechanism. After that. a deformable mesh with the same topology as the SSM is used for the final segmentation: While external forces strive to maximize the posterior probability of the mesh given the local appearance around the boundary. internal forces governed by tension and rigidity terms keep the shape similar to the underlying SSM.

MICCAI Work,,161-166,,We present a fully automated method based on an evolutionary algorithm. a statistical shape model (SSM). and a deformable mesh to tackle the liver segmentation task of the MICCAI Grand Challenge workshop. To model the expected shape and appearance. the SSM is trained on 35 training datasets. Segmentation is started by a global search with the evolutionary algorithm. which provides the initial parameters for the SSM. Subsequently. a local search similar to the Active Shape method is used to refine the detected parameters. The resulting model is used to initialize the main component of our approach: a deformable mesh that strives for an equilibrium between internal and external forces. The internal forces describe the deviation of the mesh from the underlying SSM. while the external forces model the fit to the image data. To constrain the allowed deformation. we employ a graphbased optimal surface detection during calculation of the external forces. Applied to the ten test datasets of the workshop. our method delivers comparable results to the human second rater in six cases and scores an average of 68 points.

It works by estimating a sequence of principal components that have maximal dependence on the response variable. The proposed supervised PCA is solvable in closed-form. and has a dual formulation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of problems in which the number of predictors greatly exceeds the number of observations (such as DNA microarray experiments).

In many problems. the measured data vectors are high-dimensional but we may have reason to believe that the data lie near a lower-dimensional manifold. In other words. we may believe that high-dimensional data are multiple. indirect measurements of an underlying source. which typically cannot be directly measured. Learning a suitable low-dimensional manifold from high-dimensional data is essentially the same as learning this underlying source.Dimensionality reduction1 can also be seen as the process of deriving a set of degrees of freedom which can be used to reproduce most of the variability of a data set. Consider a set of images produced by the rotation of a face through different angles.

We propose Constrained Max-Min Fairness (CMMF). an extension to max-min fairness that supports placement constraints. and show that it is the only policy satisfying an important property that incentivizes users to pool resources. Optimally computing CMMF is challenging. but we show that a remarkably simple online scheduler. called Choosy. approximates the optimal scheduler well.

However. uninhibited coordination-free execution can compromise application correctness. or consistency. When is coordination necessary for correctness? The classic use of serializable transactions is sufficient to maintain correctness but is not necessary for all applications. sacrificing potential scalability. In this paper. we develop a formal framework. invariant confluence. that determines whether an application requires coordination for correct execution. By operating on application-level invariants over database states (eg. integrity constraints). invariant confluence analysis provides a necessary and sufficient condition for safe. coordination-free execution. When programmers specify their application invariants. this analysis allows databases to coordinate only when anomalies that might violate invariants are possible. We analyze the invariant confluence of common invariants and operations from real-world database systems (ie. integrity constraints) and applications and show that many are invariant confluent and therefore achievable without coordination. We apply these results to a proof-of-concept coordination-avoiding database prototype and demonstrate sizable performance gains compared to serializable execution. notably a 25-fold improvement over prior TPC-C New-Order performance on a 200 server cluster.,True,WXbhp_4AAAAJ:LGlY6t8CeOMC,196,https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2237,14521158504337829734,/scholar?cites=14521158504337829734,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.2237,0,0,0

The provided algorithms guarantee lookup consistency in the presence of dynamism: they guarantee consistent lookup results in the presence of nodes joining and leaving. Similarly. the algorithms guarantee that routing never fails while nodes join and leave. Previous algorithms for lookup consistency either suffer from starvation. do not work in the presence of failures. or lack proof of correctness.   Several group communication algorithms for structured overlay networks are presented. We provide an overlay broadcast algorithm. which unlike previous algorithms avoids redundant messages. reaching all nodes in O(log n) time. while using O(n) messages. where n is the number of nodes in the system. The broadcast algorithm is used to build overlay multicast.   We introduce bulk operation. which enables a node to efficiently make multiple lookups or send a message to all nodes in a specified set of identifiers. The algorithm ensures that all specified nodes are reached in O(log n) time. sending maximum O(log n) messages per node. regardless of the input size of the bulk operation. Moreover. the algorithm avoids sending redundant messages. Previous approaches required multiple lookups. which consume more messages and can render the initiator a bottleneck.

For these tasks. understanding logical and semantic relationship between two sentences is required but it is yet challenging. Although attention mechanism is useful to capture the semantic relationship and to properly align the elements of two sentences. previous methods of attention mechanism simply use a summation operation which does not retain original features enough. Inspired by DenseNet. a densely connected convolutional network. we propose a densely-connected co-attentive recurrent neural network. each layer of which uses concatenated information of attentive features as well as hidden features of all the preceding recurrent layers. It enables preserving the original and the co-attentive feature information from the bottommost word embedding layer to the uppermost recurrent layer.

Although DNNs are very powerful. a large number of network parameters requires substantial storage and memory bandwidth which hinders them from being applied to actual embedded systems. Many researchers have sought ways of model compression to reduce the size of a network with minimal performance degradation. Among them. a method called knowledge transfer is to train the student network with a stronger teacher network. In this paper. we propose a method to overcome the limitations of conventional knowledge transfer methods and improve the performance of a student network. An auto-encoder is used in an unsupervised manner to extract compact factors which are defined as compressed feature maps of the teacher network. When using the factors to train the student network. we observed that the performance of the student network becomes better than the ones with other conventional knowledge transfer methods because factors contain paraphrased compact information of the teacher network that is easy for the student network to understand.,True,h_8-1M0AAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC,99,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04977,2520473274058783123,/scholar?cites=2520473274058783123,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04977,0,0,0
1279522,Principal Component Analysis by  -Norm Maximization,2013,Nojun Kwak,44,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,5,594-609,IEEE,This paper proposes several principal component analysis (PCA) methods based on L p -norm optimization techniques. In doing so. the objective function is defined using the L p -norm with an arbitrary p value. and the gradient of the objective function is computed on the basis of the fact that the number of training samples is finite. In the first part. an easier problem of extracting only one feature is dealt with. In this case. principal components are searched for either by a gradient ascent method or by a Lagrangian multiplier method. When more than one feature is needed. features can be extracted one by one greedily. based on the proposed method.

1279523,Analysis on the dropout effect in convolutional neural networks,2016,Sungheon Park and Nojun Kwak,,,,189-204,Springer. Cham,Regularizing neural networks is an important task to reduce overfitting. Dropout [1] has been a widely-used regularization trick for neural networks. In convolutional neural networks (CNNs). dropout is usually applied to the fully connected layers. Meanwhile. the regularization effect of dropout in the convolutional layers has not been thoroughly analyzed in the literature. In this paper. we analyze the effect of dropout in the convolutional layers. which is indeed proved as a powerful generalization method. We observed that dropout in CNNs regularizes the networks by adding noise to the output feature maps of each layer. yielding robustness to variations of images. Based on this observation. we propose a stochastic dropout whose drop ratio varies for each iteration. Furthermore. we propose a new regularization method which is inspired by behaviors of image filters. Rather than randomly drop the activation …,True,h_8-1M0AAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC,80,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-54184-6_12,1181520598214436129,/scholar?cites=1181520598214436129,,,http://mipal.snu.ac.kr/images/archive/1/16/20190516013446%21Dropout_ACCV2016.pdf,0,0,0

Moreover. the DilatedRNN reduces the number of parameters needed and enhances training efficiency significantly. while matching state-of-the-art performance (even with standard RNN cells) in tasks involving very long-term dependencies.

However. a major obstacle facing deep RL in the real world is their high sample complexity. Batch policy gradient methods offer stable learning. but at the cost of high variance. which often requires large batches. TD-style methods. such as off-policy actor-critic and Q-learning. are more sample-efficient but biased. and often require costly hyperparameter sweeps to stabilize.

Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable. and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and off-policy methods. We analyze the connection between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms. and use control variate theory to derive two variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive adaptation.

An RNN is first pre-trained on data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). and the probability distribution over the next token in the sequence learned by this model is treated as a prior policy. Another RNN is then trained using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate higher-quality outputs that account for domain-specific incentives while retaining proximity to the prior policy of the MLE RNN. To formalize this objective. we derive novel off-policy RL methods for RNNs from KL-control. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two applications; 1) generating novel musical melodies. and 2) computational molecular generation.

However. its sample efficiency is often impractically large for solving challenging real-world problems. even with off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning. A limiting factor in classic model-free RL is that the learning signal consists only of scalar rewards. ignoring much of the rich information contained in state transition tuples. Model-based RL uses this information. by training a predictive model. but often does not achieve the same asymptotic performance as model-free RL due to model bias. We introduce temporal difference models (TDMs). a family of goal-conditioned value functions that can be trained with model-free learning and used for model-based control. TDMs combine the benefits of model-free and model-based RL: they leverage the rich information in state transitions to learn very efficiently. while still attaining asymptotic performance that exceeds that of direct model-based RL methods.

1279567,Muprop: Unbiased backpropagation for stochastic neural networks,2015,Shixiang Gu and Sergey Levine and Ilya Sutskever and Andriy Mnih,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.05176,,,,Deep neural networks are powerful parametric models that can be trained efficiently using the backpropagation algorithm. Stochastic neural networks combine the power of large parametric functions with that of graphical models. which makes it possible to learn very complex distributions. However. as backpropagation is not directly applicable to stochastic networks that include discrete sampling operations within their computational graph. training such networks remains difficult. We present MuProp. an unbiased gradient estimator for stochastic networks. designed to make this task easier. MuProp improves on the likelihood-ratio estimator by reducing its variance using a control variate based on the first-order Taylor expansion of a mean-field network. Crucially. unlike prior attempts at using backpropagation for training stochastic networks. the resulting estimator is unbiased and well behaved. Our experiments on structured output prediction and discrete latent variable modeling demonstrate that MuProp yields consistently good performance across a range of difficult tasks.,True,B8wslVsAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,118,https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05176,10978254973429157293,/scholar?cites=10978254973429157293,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05176,0,0,0

This method is based on the notion of the conditional information complexity of a function which is the minimum amount of information about the inputs that has to be revealed by a communication protocol for the function. While conditional information complexity is a lower bound on communication complexity. we show that it also admits a direct sum theorem. Direct sum decomposition reduces our task to that of proving conditional information complexity lower bounds for simple problems (such as the AND of two bits). For the latter. we develop novel techniques based on Hellinger distance and its generalizations. Our paradigm leads to two main results:(1) An improved lower bound for the multi-party set-disjointness problem in the general communication complexity model. and a nearly optimal lower bound in the one-way …,True,8P-bBdIAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,623,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000003001855,9059767926623490960,/scholar?cites=9059767926623490960,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000003001855/pdf?md5=035273a0d38553b76af6271c113ddefe&pid=1-s2.0-S0022000003001855-main.pdf&_valck=1,0,0,0

We present a novel technique called Hindsight Experience Replay which allows sample-efficient learning from rewards which are sparse and binary and therefore avoid the need for complicated reward engineering. It can be combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum.We demonstrate our approach on the task of manipulating objects with a robotic arm. In particular. we run experiments on three different tasks: pushing. sliding. and pick-and-place. in each case using only binary rewards indicating whether or not the task is completed.

1279592,Sim-to-real transfer of robotic control with dynamics randomization,2018,Xue Bin Peng and Marcin Andrychowicz and Wojciech Zaremba and Pieter Abbeel,,,,3803-3810,IEEE,Simulations are attractive environments for training agents as they provide an abundant source of data and alleviate certain safety concerns during the training process. But the behaviours developed by agents in simulation are often specific to the characteristics of the simulator. Due to modeling error. strategies that are successful in simulation may not transfer to their real world counterparts. In this paper. we demonstrate a simple method to bridge this “reality gap”. By randomizing the dynamics of the simulator during training. we are able to develop policies that are capable of adapting to very different dynamics. including ones that differ significantly from the dynamics on which the policies were trained. This adaptivity enables the policies to generalize to the dynamics of the real world without any training on the physical system.

This usually requires either careful feature engineering. or a significant number of samples. This is far from what we desire: ideally. robots should be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any given task. and instantly generalize to new situations of the same task. without requiring task-specific engineering. In this paper. we propose a meta-learning framework for achieving such capability. which we call one-shot imitation learning.Specifically. we consider the setting where there is a very large set of tasks. and each task has many instantiations. For example. a task could be to stack all blocks on a table into a single tower. another task could be to place all blocks on a table into two-block towers. etc. In each case. different instances of the task would consist of different sets of blocks with different initial states. At training time. our algorithm is presented with pairs of demonstrations for a subset of all tasks. A neural net is trained that takes as input one demonstration and the current state (which initially is the initial state of the other demonstration of the pair). and outputs an action with the goal that the resulting sequence of states and actions matches as closely as possible with the second demonstration. At test time. a demonstration of a single instance of a new task is presented. and the neural net is expected to perform well on new instances of this new task. The use of soft attention allows the model to generalize to conditions and tasks unseen in the training data.

The goal of this paper is to show how these properties of Bit coin can be used in the area of secure multiparty computation protocols (MPCs).

An alternative is to add noise directly to the agent's parameters. which can lead to more consistent exploration and a richer set of behaviors. Methods such as evolutionary strategies use parameter perturbations. but discard all temporal structure in the process and require significantly more samples. Combining parameter noise with traditional RL methods allows to combine the best of both worlds. We demonstrate that both off-and on-policy methods benefit from this approach through experimental comparison of DQN.

Many tasks are natural to specify with a sparse reward. and manually shaping a reward function can result in suboptimal performance.

Simulation results supported by analysis show that breadth-first tree-search algorithms using a decorrelating noise whitening receiver filter perform better than similar receivers. which solely use a matched filter (MF) for virtually all nonsingular spreading code sets studied. Most of the code sets are randomly generated. The M- and T-algorithm detectors based on decorrelating noise whitening filter (WF) outputs can achieve near optimum performance at a very low complexity compared to the …,True,vPb05lUAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,135,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/592610/,9357408889737888007,/scholar?cites=9357408889737888007,,,,0,0,0
1279609,Asymptotic normality of linear multiuser receiver outputs,2002,Dongning Guo and Sergio Verdú and Lars K Rasmussen,48,IEEE transactions on information theory,12,3080-3095,IEEE,This paper proves large-system asymptotic normality of the output of a family of linear multiuser receivers that can be arbitrarily well approximated by polynomial receivers. This family of receivers encompasses the single-user matched filter. the decorrelator. the minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver. the parallel interference cancelers. and many other linear receivers of interest. Both with and without the assumption of perfect power control. we show that the output decision statistic for each user converges to a Gaussian random variable in distribution as the number of users and the spreading factor both tend to infinity with their ratio fixed. Analysis reveals that the distribution conditioned on almost all spreading sequences converges to the same distribution. which is also the unconditional distribution.

1279610,Constrained maximum-likelihood detection in CDMA,2001,Peng Hui Tan and Lars K Rasmussen and Teng J Lim,49,IEEE Transactions on Communications,1,142-153,IEEE,The detection strategy usually denoted optimal multiuser detection is equivalent to the solution of a (0. 1)-constrained maximum-likelihood (ML) problem. a problem which is known to be NP-hard. In contrast. the unconstrained ML problem can be solved quite easily and is known as the decorrelating detector. In this paper. we consider the constrained ML problem where the solution vector is restricted to lie within a closed convex set (CCS). Such a design criterion leads to detector structures which are ML under the constraint assumption. A close relationship between a sphere-constrained ML detector and the well-known minimum mean square error detector is found and verified. An iterative algorithm for solving a CCS constraint problem is derived based on results in linear variational inequality theory. Special cases of this algorithm. subject to a box-constraint. are found to correspond to known. nonlinear successive …,True,vPb05lUAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,129,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/898258/,14302137926340753998,/scholar?cites=14302137926340753998,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Teng_Lim/publication/3160324_Constrained_maximum-likelihood_detection_in_CDMA/links/00b4952bbd07b1a98c000000.pdf,0,0,0

Optimal joint decoding is prohibitively complex. Instead. we propose a sequential approach for handling multiple-access interference and error-control decoding. Error-control decoding is implemented via single-user soft-input decoders utilizing metrics generated by linear algebraic multiuser metric generators. The decorrelator. and a new scheme termed the projection receiver. are utilized as metric generators. For a synchronous system. the coded performance of the projection receiver metric is shown to be superior to the decorrelator even though they are equally complex.

The presented tracker simply matches the initial patch of the target in the first frame with candidates in a new frame and returns the most similar patch by a learned matching function. The strength of the matching function comes from being extensively trained generically. ie. without any data of the target. using a Siamese deep neural network. which we design for tracking. Once learned. the matching function is used as is. without any adapting. to track previously unseen targets. It turns out that the learned matching function is so powerful that a simple tracker built upon it. coined Siamese INstance search Tracker.

The dynamic image is based on the rank pooling concept and is obtained through the parameters of a ranking machine that encodes the temporal evolution of the frames of the video. Dynamic images are obtained by directly applying rank pooling on the raw image pixels of a video producing a single RGB image per video. This idea is simple but powerful as it enables the use of existing CNN models directly on video data with fine-tuning. We present an efficient and effective approximate rank pooling operator. speeding it up orders of magnitude compared to rank pooling.

The MediaMill team participated in three tasks: concept detection. automatic search. and in- teractive search. The starting point for the MediaMill con- cept detection approach is our top-performing bag-of-words system of last year. which uses multiple color descriptors. codebooks with soft-assignment. and kernel-based supervised learning. We improve upon this baseline system by explor- ing two novel research directions. Firstly. we study a multi- modal extension by including 20 audio concepts and fusion using two novel multi-kernel supervised learning methods. Secondly. with the help of recently proposed algorithmic re- nements of bag-of-word representations. a GPU implemen- tation. and compute clusters. we scale-up the amount of vi- sual information analyzed by an order of magnitude. to a total of 1.000.000 i-frames. Our experiments evaluate the merit of these new components. ultimately leading to 64 ro- bust concept detectors for video retrieval. For retrieval. a robust but limited set of concept detectors justi es the need to rely on as many auxiliary information channels as pos- sible. For automatic search we therefore explore how we can learn to rank various information channels simultane- ously to maximize video search results for a given topic. To further improve the video retrieval results. our interactive search experiments investigate the roles of visualizing pre- view results for a certain browse-dimension and relevance feedback mechanisms that learn to solve complex search top- ics by analysis from user browsing behavior.

1279649,Towards optimal structured cnn pruning via generative adversarial learning,2019,Shaohui Lin and Rongrong Ji and Chenqian Yan and Baochang Zhang and Liujuan Cao and Qixiang Ye and Feiyue Huang and David Doermann,,,,2790-2799,,Structured pruning of filters or neurons has received increased focus for compressing convolutional neural networks. Most existing methods rely on multi-stage optimizations in a layer-wise manner for iteratively pruning and retraining which may not be optimal and may be computation intensive. Besides. these methods are designed for pruning a specific structure. such as filter or block structures without jointly pruning heterogeneous structures. In this paper. we propose an effective structured pruning approach that jointly prunes filters as well as other structures in an end-to-end manner. To accomplish this. we first introduce a soft mask to scale the output of these structures by defining a new objective function with sparsity regularization to align the output of baseline and network with this mask. We then effectively solve the optimization problem by generative adversarial learning (GAL). which learns a sparse soft mask in a label-free and an end-to-end manner. By forcing more scale factors in the soft mask to zero. the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) can be leveraged to fast and reliably remove the corresponding structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GAL on different datasets. including MNIST. CIFAR-10 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012. For example. on ImageNet ILSVRC 2012. the pruned ResNet-50 achieves 10.88% Top-5 error and results in a factor of 3.7 x speedup.

In this paper. we propose a trellis encoder-decoder network (TEDnet) for crowd counting. which focuses on generating high-quality density estimation maps. The major contributions are four-fold. First. we develop a new trellis architecture that incorporates multiple decoding paths to hierarchically aggregate features at different encoding stages. which improves the representative capability of convolutional features for large variations in objects. Second. we employ dense skip connections interleaved across paths to facilitate sufficient multi-scale feature fusions. which also helps TEDnet to absorb the supervision information. Third. we propose a new combinatorial loss to enforce similarities in local coherence and spatial correlation between maps. By distributedly imposing this combinatorial loss on intermediate outputs. TEDnet can improve the back-propagation process and alleviate the gradient vanishing problem. Finally. on four widely-used benchmarks. our TEDnet achieves the best overall performance in terms of both density map quality and counting accuracy. with an improvement up to 14% in MAE metric.

This paper presents a low-cost descriptor called 3D histograms of texture (3DHoTs) to extract discriminant features from a sequence of depth maps. 3DHoTs are derived from projecting depth frames onto three orthogonal Cartesian planes. i.e.. the frontal. side. and top planes. and thus compactly characterize the salient information of a specific action. on which texture features are calculated to represent the action. Besides this fast feature descriptor. a new multi-class boosting classifier (MBC) is also proposed to efficiently exploit different kinds of features in a unified framework for action classification.

Among various approaches proposed in the literature. filter pruning has been regarded as a promising solution. which is due to its advantage in significant speedup and memory reduction of both network model and intermediate feature maps. To this end. most approaches tend to prune filters in a layerwise fixed manner. which is incapable to dynamically recover the previously removed filter. as well as jointly optimize the pruned network across layers. In this paper. we propose a novel global & dynamic pruning (GDP) scheme to prune redundant filters for CNN acceleration. In particular. GDP first globally prunes the unsalient filters across all layers by proposing a global discriminative function based on prior knowledge of each filter. Second. it dynamically updates the filter saliency all over the pruned sparse network. and then recovers the mistakenly pruned filter. followed by a retraining phase to improve the model accuracy. Specially. we effectively solve the corresponding nonconvex optimization problem of the proposed GDP via stochastic gradient descent with greedy alternative updating. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance to accelerate several cutting-edge CNNs on the ILSVRC 2012 benchmark. comparing to the state-of-the-art filter pruning methods.,True,ImJz6MsAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,99,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuchao_Li8/publication/326206282_Accelerating_Convolutional_Networks_via_Global_Dynamic_Filter_Pruning/links/5c1b81eb299bf12be38ca352/Accelerating-Convolutional-Networks-via-Global-Dynamic-Filter-Pruning.pdf,4040859315541039222,/scholar?cites=4040859315541039222,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuchao_Li8/publication/326206282_Accelerating_Convolutional_Networks_via_Global_Dynamic_Filter_Pruning/links/5c1b81eb299bf12be38ca352/Accelerating-Convolutional-Networks-via-Global-Dynamic-Filter-Pruning.pdf,0,0,0

To address this issue. this paper proposes an effective framework. named compact and discriminative stacked autoencoder (CDSAE). for HSI classification. The proposed CDSAE framework comprises two stages with different optimization objectives. which can learn discriminative low-dimensional feature mappings and train an effective classifier progressively.

Classical neural networks are implemented as one stream from the input to the output with subsampling operators applied in the stream in order to reduce the feature maps size and to increase the receptive field for the final prediction.

Contrary to the dominant methodology. which relies on hand-crafted features that are manually engineered to be optimal for a specific task. our neural model automatically learns a sparse shift-invariant representation of the local 2D+ t salient information. without any use of prior knowledge. To that aim. a spatio-temporal convolutional sparse autoencoder is trained to project a given input in a feature space. and to reconstruct it from its projection coordinates. Learning is performed in an unsupervised manner by minimizing a global parametrized objective function. The sparsity is ensured by adding a sparsifying logistic between the encoder and the decoder. while the shift-invariance is handled by including an additional hidden variable to the objective function. The temporal evolution of the obtained sparse features is learned by a long short-term memory recurrent neural network trained to classify each sequence. We show that. since the feature learning process is problem-independent. the model achieves outstanding performances when applied to two different problems. namely human action and facial expression recognition.

Thus. following detailed discussion of previous work. three scenarios are considered here for which solutions to the basic attribution problem are inadequate. In the first variant. the profiling problem. there is no candidate set at all; in this case. the challenge is to provide as much demographic or psychological information as possible about the author. In the second variant. the needle‐in‐a‐haystack problem. there are many thousands of candidates for each of whom we might have a very limited writing sample.

In this paper. we consider authorship attribution as found in the wild: the set of known candidates is extremely large (possibly many thousands) and might not even include the actual author. Moreover. the known texts and the anonymous texts might be of limited length. We show that even in these difficult cases. we can use similarity-based methods along with multiple randomized feature sets to achieve high precision.

Nevertheless. the high computational complexity of the full-search algorithm has motivated a host of suboptimal but faster search strategies. A popular example is the three-step search (TSS) algorithm. However. its uniformly spaced search pattern is not well matched to most real-world video sequences in which the motion vector distribution is nonuniformly biased toward the zero vector. Such an observation inspired the new three-step search (NTSS) which has a center-biased search pattern and supports a halfway-stop technique. It is faster on average. and gives better motion estimation as compared to the well-known TSS.

RAR follows the pipeline of cascaded regressions that refines landmark locations progressively. However. instead of updating all the landmark locations together. RAR refines the landmark locations sequentially at each recurrent stage. In this way. more reliable landmark points are refined earlier and help to infer locations of other challenging landmarks that may stay with occlusions and/or extreme poses. RAR can thus effectively control detection errors from those challenging landmarks and improve overall performance even in presence of heavy occlusions and/or extreme conditions. To determine the sequence of landmarks. RAR employs an attentive-refinement mechanism.

The video codec first performs a motion-compensated three-dimensional (3-D) wavelet (packet) decomposition of a group of video frames. and then encodes the important wavelet coefficients using a new data structure called tri-zerotrees (TRI-ZTR). Together. the proposed video coding framework forms an extension of the original zero tree idea of Shapiro (1992) for still image compression. In addition. we also incorporate a high degree of video scalability into the codec by combining the layered/progressive coding strategy with the concept of embedded resolution block coding.

This application focuses on detecting and labeling actions in untrimmed videos. which brings more challenge than classifying pre-segmented videos. The major difficulty for action localization is the uncertainty of action occurrence and utilization of information from different scales. Two innovations are proposed to address this issue. First. we propose a Pyramid of Score Distribution Feature (PSDF) to capture the motion information at multiple resolutions centered at each detection window. This novel feature mitigates the influence of unknown action position and duration. and shows significant performance gain over previous detection approaches. Second. inter-frame consistency is further explored by incorporating PSDF into the state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Networks. which gives additional performance gain in detecting actions in temporally untrimmed videos.

Current computer vision systems used handcrafted features. and did not get good results. In this study. our team designed a 13-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). Three types of data augmentation method was used: image rotation. Gamma correction. and noise injection. We also compared max pooling with average pooling. The stochastic gradient descent with momentum was used to train the CNN with minibatch size of 128. The overall accuracy of our method is 94.94%. at least 5 percentage points higher than state-of-the-art approaches. We validated this 13-layer is the optimal structure.

We argue that there are significant weaknesses in this approach. including flawed assumptions of monotonicity and locality.

To address this sparsity problem. auxiliary information such as item content information may be utilized.

These models are highly sample efficient as related concepts in the graph structure share statistical strength allowing generalization to new classes when faced with a lack of data. However. multi-layer architectures. which are required to propagate knowledge to distant nodes in the graph. dilute the knowledge by performing extensive Laplacian smoothing at each layer and thereby consequently decrease performance. In order to still enjoy the benefit brought by the graph structure while preventing dilution of knowledge from distant nodes. we propose a Dense Graph Propagation (DGP) module with carefully designed direct links among distant nodes. DGP allows us to exploit the hierarchical graph structure of the knowledge graph through additional connections. These connections are added based on a node's relationship to its ancestors and descendants. A weighting scheme is further used to weigh their contribution depending on the distance to the node to improve information propagation in the graph.

Since tagging information is usually very sparse. effective learning of the content representation for these resources is crucial to accurate tag recommendation. Recently. models proposed for tag recommendation. such as collaborative topic regression and its variants. have demonstrated promising accuracy. However. a limitation of these models is that. by using topic models like latent Dirichlet allocation as the key component. the learned representation may not be compact and effective enough. Moreover. since relational data exist as an auxiliary data source in many applications. it is desirable to incorporate such data into tag recommendation models. In this paper. we start with a deep learning model called stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) in an attempt to learn more effective content representation. We propose a probabilistic formulation for SDAE and then extend it to a relational SDAE (RSDAE) model. RSDAE jointly performs deep representation learning and relational learning in a principled way under a probabilistic framework.

However. most of them use either handcrafted features or the bag-of-words representation as a surrogate for the content information but they are neither effective nor natural enough. To address this problem. we develop a collaborative recurrent autoencoder (CRAE) which is a denoising recurrent autoencoder (DRAE) that models the generation of content sequences in the collaborative filtering (CF) setting. The model generalizes recent advances in recurrent deep learning from iid input to non-iid (CF-based) input and provides a new denoising scheme along with a novel learnable pooling scheme for the recurrent autoencoder. To do this. we first develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for the DRAE and then generalize it to the CF setting. The synergy between denoising and CF enables CRAE to make accurate recommendations while learning to fill in the blanks in sequences. Experiments on real-world datasets from different domains (CiteULike and Netflix) show that. by jointly modeling the order-aware generation of sequences for the content information and performing CF for the ratings.

1279752,Relational collaborative topic regression for recommender systems,2015,Hao Wang and Wu-Jun Li,27,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,5,1343-1355,IEEE,Due to its successful application in recommender systems. collaborative filtering (CF) has become a hot research topic in data mining and information retrieval. In traditional CF methods. only the feedback matrix. which contains either explicit feedback (also called ratings) or implicit feedback on the items given by users. is used for training and prediction. Typically. the feedback matrix is sparse. which means that most users interact with few items. Due to this sparsity problem. traditional CF with only feedback information will suffer from unsatisfactory performance.

The resulting breathing signal can be used to infer the person's sleep quality and stages; it also allows for monitoring sleep apnea and other sleep disordered breathing (SDB); all without any body contact.

1279754,Relational Deep Learning: A Deep Latent Variable Model for Link Prediction.,2017,Hao Wang and Xingjian Shi and Dit-Yan Yeung,,,,2688-2694,,Link prediction is a fundamental task in such areas as social network analysis. information retrieval. and bioinformatics. Usually link prediction methods use the link structures or node attributes as the sources of information. Recently. the relational topic model (RTM) and its variants have been proposed as hybrid methods that jointly model both sources of information and achieve very promising accuracy. However. the representations (features) learned by them are still not effective enough to represent the nodes (items). To address this problem. we generalize recent advances in deep learning from solely modeling iid sequences of attributes to jointly modeling graphs and non-iid sequences of attributes. Specifically. we follow the Bayesian deep learning framework and devise a hierarchical Bayesian model. called relational deep learning (RDL). to jointly model high-dimensional node attributes and link structures with layers of latent variables. Due to the multiple nonlinear transformations in RDL. standard variational inference is not applicable. We propose to utilize the product of Gaussians (PoG) structure in RDL to relate the inferences on different variables and derive a generalized variational inference algorithm for learning the variables and predicting the links.

Samples generated by existing text-to-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions. but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts.

Moreover. the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore. recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight. we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics.

This limits CNN-based methods from reaching their full potential in detecting and utilizing small semantic parts in recognition. Introducing such mid-level layers can facilitate the extraction of part-specific features which can be utilized for better recognition performance. This is particularly important in the domain of fine-grained recognition. In this paper. we propose a new CNN architecture that integrates semantic part detection and abstraction (SPDA-CNN) for fine-grained classification. The proposed network has two sub-networks: one for detection and one for recognition. The detection sub-network has a novel top-down proposal method to generate small semantic part candidates for detection. The classification sub-network introduces novel part layers that extract features from parts detected by the detection sub-network. and combine them for recognition. As a result. the proposed architecture provides an end-to-end network that performs detection. localization of multiple semantic parts. and whole object recognition within one framework that shares the computation of convolutional filters. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a large margin for small parts detection (eg our precision of 93.40% vs the best previous precision of 74.00% for detecting the head on CUB-2011).

Urban traffic gridlock is a familiar scene. Ridesharing has the potential to solve many environmental. congestion. and energy problems. In this paper. we introduce the problem of large scale real-time ridesharing with service guarantee on road networks.

We first propose two basic algorithms: a branch-and-bound algorithm and an integer programing algorithm. However. these algorithm structures do not adapt well to the dynamic nature of the ridesharing problem. Thus. we then propose a kinetic tree algorithm capable of better scheduling dynamic requests and adjusting routes on-the-fly. We perform experiments on a large real taxi dataset from Shanghai. The results show that the kinetic tree algorithm is faster than other algorithms in response time.,True,lNQmMTMAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,182,https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6666,17671308943428619632,/scholar?cites=17671308943428619632,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.6666,0,0,0
1279773,Distance-constraint reachability computation in uncertain graphs,2011,Ruoming Jin and Lin Liu and Bolin Ding and Haixun Wang,4,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,9,551-562,VLDB Endowment,Driven by the emerging network applications. querying and mining uncertain graphs has become increasingly important. In this paper. we investigate a fundamental problem concerning uncertain graphs. which we call the distance-constraint reachability (DCR) problem: Given two vertices s and t. what is the probability that the distance from s to t is less than or equal to a user-defined threshold d in the uncertain graph? Since this problem is #P-Complete. we focus on efficiently and accurately approximating DCR online. Our main results include two new estimators for the probabilistic reachability. One is a Horvitz-Thomson type estimator based on the unequal probabilistic sampling scheme. and the other is a novel recursive sampling estimator. which effectively combines a deterministic recursive computational procedure with a sampling process to boost the estimation accuracy. Both estimators can produce much …,True,lNQmMTMAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,172,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/2002938.2002941,16546143182087314057,/scholar?cites=16546143182087314057,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vldb11reachability.pdf,0,0,0
1279774,An algorithm for in-core frequent itemset mining on streaming data,2005,Ruoming Jin and Gagan Agrawal,,,,8 pp.,IEEE,Frequent item set mining is a core data mining operation and has been extensively studied over the last decade. This paper takes a new approach for this problem and makes two major contributions. First. we present a one pass algorithm for frequent item set mining. which has deterministic bounds on the accuracy. and does not require any out-of-core summary structure. Second. because our one pass algorithm does not produce any false negatives. it can be easily extended to a two pass accurate algorithm. Our two pass algorithm is very memory efficient. and allows mining of datasets with large number of distinct items and/or very low support levels. Our detailed experimental evaluation on synthetic and real datasets shows the following. First. our one pass algorithm is very accurate in practice. Second. our algorithm requires significantly lower memory than Manku and Motwani's one pass algorithm and the multi …,True,lNQmMTMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,153,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1565681/,16877915814271446322,/scholar?cites=16877915814271446322,,,https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/741/jpei/readings/JiAg04.pdf,0,0,0

K-means requires several passes on the entire dataset. which can make it very expensive for large disk-resident datasets. In view of this. a lot of work has been done on various approximate versions of k-means. which require only one or a small number of passes on the entire dataset.In this paper. we present a new algorithm. called fast and exact k-means clustering (FEKM). which typically requires only one or a small number of passes on the entire dataset and provably produces the same cluster centres as reported by the original k-means algorithm. The algorithm uses sampling to create initial cluster centres and then takes one or more passes over the entire dataset to adjust these cluster centres. We provide theoretical analysis to show that the …,True,lNQmMTMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,125,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-005-0210-0,6395958449826560373,/scholar?cites=6395958449826560373,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.87.7732&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
