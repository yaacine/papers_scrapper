30272,An integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome,2012.0,ENCODE Project Consortium,489.0,Nature,7414,57-74,Nature Publishing Group,The human genome encodes the blueprint of life. but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription. transcription factor association. chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80% of the genome. in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes. providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease. and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall. the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome. and is …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:Qh5Z_vBjo80C,11344,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11247,13001593243986802887,/scholar?cites=13001593243986802887,,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11247,0,0,0

Current approaches focus on direct changes in protein coding genes. particularly nonsynonymous mutations that directly affect the gene product. However. most individual variation occurs outside of genes and. indeed. most markers generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify variants outside of coding segments. Identification of potential regulatory changes that perturb these sites will lead to a better localization of truly functional variants and interpretation of their effects.

By high-throughput immunolocalization of tagged gene products. we have determined the subcellular localization of 2744 yeast proteins. Extrapolating these data through a computational algorithm employing Bayesian formalism. we define the yeast localizome (the subcellular distribution of all 6100 yeast proteins). We estimate the yeast proteome to encompass ∼5100 soluble proteins and >1000 transmembrane proteins.

CEN function. and chromosome size. A cloned ochre-suppressing form of a tRNA gene. SUPll. serves as a marker on natural and in vitro-constructed chromosomes. In diploid strains homozygous for an ochre mutation in ade2. cells carrying no copies of the SUP11 gene are red. those carrying one copy are pink. and those carrying two or more copies are white. Thus. the degree of red sectoring in colonies reflects the frequency of mitotic chromosome loss. The assay also distinguishes between chromosome loss (1: O segregation) and nondisjunction (2: 0 segregation). The most dramatic effect on improving mitotic stability is caused by increasing chromosome size.

Here. we show that H3K4me3 domains that spread more broadly over genes in a given cell type preferentially mark genes that are essential for the identity and function of that cell type. Using the broadest H3K4me3 domains as a discovery tool in neural progenitor cells. we identify novel regulators of these cells. Machine learning models reveal that the broadest H3K4me3 domains represent a distinct entity. characterized by increased marks of elongation. The broadest H3K4me3 domains also have more paused polymerase at their promoters. suggesting a unique transcriptional output.

Six sera were identified that recognize an antigen(s) with a cell cycle-dependent localization pattern. In interphase cells. the antibodies stained the nucleus and in mitotic cells the spindle apparatus was recognized. Immunological criteria indicate that the antigen recognized by at least one of these sera corresponds to a previously identified protein called the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA). A cDNA which partially encodes NuMA was cloned from a lambda gt11 human placental cDNA expression library. and overlapping cDNA clones that encode the entire gene were isolated.

While high throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing these problems. its success is dependent upon the availability and quality of reference genome sequences. thus limiting the organisms to which it can be applied. Here. we describe Rnnotator. an automated software pipeline that generates transcript models by de novo assembly of RNA-Seq data without the need for a reference genome. We have applied the Rnnotator assembly pipeline to two yeast transcriptomes and compared the results to the reference gene catalogs of these organisms. The contigs produced by Rnnotator are highly accurate (95%) and reconstruct full-length genes for the majority of the existing gene models (54.3%). Furthermore. our analyses revealed many novel transcribed regions that are absent from well annotated genomes. suggesting Rnnotator serves as a complementary approach to analysis based on a reference genome for comprehensive transcriptomics.

This paper aims to identify ways in which the social context of migrant farm workers affects their health and health care.   Methods and Findings This qualitative study employs participant observation and interviews on farms and in clinics throughout 15 months of migration with a group of indigenous Triqui Mexicans in the western US and Mexico. Study participants include more than 130 farm workers and 30 clinicians. Data are analyzed utilizing grounded theory. accompanied by theories of structural violence. symbolic violence. and the clinical gaze. The study reveals that farm working and housing conditions are organized according to ethnicity and citizenship. This hierarchy determines health disparities. with undocumented indigenous Mexicans having the worst health. Yet. each group is understood to deserve its place in the hierarchy. migrant farm workers often being blamed for their own sicknesses.   Conclusions Structural racism and anti-immigrant practices determine the poor working conditions. living conditions. and health of migrant workers.

We report here that serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) agonists. typically investigated for their anorectic properties. significantly improve glucose tolerance and reduce plasma insulin in murine models of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Importantly. 5-HT2CR agonist-induced improvements in glucose homeostasis occurred at concentrations of agonist that had no effect on ingestive behavior. energy expenditure. locomotor activity. body weight. or fat mass. We determined that this primary effect on glucose homeostasis requires downstream activation of melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs). but not MC3Rs.

Chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF have been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes including gene expression. nuclear organization. centromere function. and chromosomal stability. and mutations in SWI/SNF components have been linked to several types of cancer. To better understand the biological processes in which chromatin remodeling proteins participate. we globally mapped binding regions for several components of the SWI/SNF complex throughout the human genome using ChIP-Seq. SWI/SNF components were found to lie near regulatory elements integral to transcription (e.g. 5′ ends. RNA Polymerases II and III. and enhancers) as well as regions critical for chromosome organization (e.g. CTCF. lamins. and DNA replication origins). Interestingly we also find that certain configurations of SWI/SNF subunits are associated with transcripts that have higher levels of expression. whereas other configurations of SWI/SNF factors are associated with transcripts that have lower levels of expression. To further elucidate the association of SWI/SNF subunits with each other as well as with other nuclear proteins. we also analyzed SWI/SNF immunoprecipitated complexes by mass spectrometry.

This DNA breakage has properties similar to those obtained in vitro with DNA gyrase reaction mixtures designed to assay production of supertwists: it is oxolinic acid-dependent. sodium dodecyl sulfate-activated. and at saturating drug concentrations produces double-strand DNA cleavage with a concommitant tight association of protein and DNA. In addition. identical treatments performed on a nalA mutant strain exhibit no DNA cleavage. Thus the DNA cleavage sites probably correspond to chromosomal DNA gyrase sites.

This loss of DNA supercoiling paralleled inhibition of DNA synthesis. Coumermycin also produced a loss of supercoiling in non-replicating chromosomes that had been synchronized by amino acid starvation. The drug had no effect on supercoiling in chromosomes isolated from a mutant bacterial strain from which Gellert et al. found coumermycin-resistant gyrase activity. Thus. the correlation between coumermycin inhibition of cell growth. DNA synthesis. and in vitro gyrase activity now extends to the loss of chromosomal DNA supercoiling.

The hemapoietic lineage-specific transcription factor GATA-1 is important for erythroid differentiation and has been implicated in regulating the expression of the erythroid-specific genes including the genes of the β-globin locus. In the human erythroleukemic K562 cell line. only one DNA region has been identified previously as a putative site of GATA-1 interaction by in vivo footprinting studies.

We globally identified the promoters occupied by SREBP1 and its binding partners NFY and SP1 in a human hepatocyte cell line using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with genome tiling arrays (ChIP-chip). We find that SREBP1 occupies the promoters of 1.141 target genes involved in diverse biological pathways. including novel targets with roles in lipid metabolism and insulin signaling. We also identify a conserved SREBP1 DNA-binding motif in SREBP1 target promoters. and we demonstrate that many SREBP1 target genes are transcriptionally activated by treatment with insulin and glucose using gene expression microarrays. Finally. we show that SREBP1 cooperates extensively with NFY and SP1 throughout the genome and that unique combinations of these factors target distinct functional pathways.

Undifferentiated hESCs as well as cells at three stages of early neural differentiation—N1 (early initiation). N2 (neural progenitor). and N3 (early glial-like)—were analyzed using a combination of single read. paired-end read. and long read RNA sequencing. The results revealed enormous complexity in gene transcription and splicing dynamics during neural cell differentiation. We found previously unannotated transcripts and spliced isoforms specific for each stage of differentiation. Interestingly. splicing isoform diversity is highest in undifferentiated hESCs and decreases upon differentiation. a phenomenon we call isoform specialization.

Ethanol has been found to increase the virulence of A. baumannii in Dictyostelium discoideum and Caenorhabditis elegans models of infection. To better understand the causes of this effect. we examined the transcriptional profile of A. baumannii grown in the presence or absence of ethanol using RNA-Seq. Using the Illumina/Solexa platform. a total of 43.453.960 reads (35 nt) were obtained. of which 3.596.474 mapped uniquely to the genome. Our analysis revealed that ethanol induces the expression of 49 genes that belong to different functional categories. A strong induction was observed for genes encoding metabolic enzymes. indicating that ethanol is efficiently assimilated. In addition. we detected the induction of genes encoding stress proteins. including upsA. hsp90. groEL and lon as well as permeases. efflux pumps and a secreted phospholipase C. In stationary phase. ethanol strongly induced several genes involved with iron assimilation and a high-affinity phosphate transport system. indicating that A. baumannii makes a better use of the iron and phosphate resources in the medium when ethanol is used as a carbon source. To evaluate the role of phospholipase C (Plc1) in virulence. we generated and analyzed a deletion mutant for plc1. This strain exhibits a modest. but reproducible. reduction in the cytotoxic effect caused by A. baumannii on epithelial cells. suggesting that phospholipase C is important for virulence.

The SPA2 gene of yeast encodes a nonessential protein that localizes to sites of cell growth and to the site of cytokinesis. spa2 mutants exhibit slightly altered budding patterns. In this report. a genetic screen was used to isolate a novel ochre allele of CDC10. cdc10-10; strains containing this mutation require the SPA2 gene for growth.

Spatial coordination of these events ensures that each daughter cell inherits a nucleus. Here we show that. in budding yeast. capture and shrinkage of astral microtubules at the bud neck is required to position the spindle relative to the cleavage apparatus. Capture required the septins and the microtubule-associated protein Kar9.

The genomic content of OR genes is considerably reduced in humans. as reflected by the relatively small repertoire size and the high fraction (∼55%) of human pseudogenes. Since several recent low-resolution surveys suggested that OR genomic loci are frequently affected by copy-number variants (CNVs). we hypothesized that CNVs may play an important role in the evolution of the human olfactory repertoire. We used high-resolution oligonucleotide tiling microarrays to detect CNVs across 851 OR gene and pseudogene loci. Examining genomic DNA from 25 individuals with ancestry from three populations. we identified 93 OR gene loci and 151 pseudogene loci affected by CNVs. generating a mosaic of OR dosages across persons. Our data suggest that ∼50% of the CNVs involve more than one OR. with the largest CNV spanning 11 loci. In contrast to earlier reports. we observe that CNVs are more frequent among OR pseudogenes than among intact genes. presumably due to both selective constraints and CNV formation biases. Furthermore. our results show an enrichment of CNVs among ORs with a close human paralog or lacking a one-to-one ortholog in chimpanzee. Interestingly. among the latter we observed an enrichment in CNV losses over gains. a finding potentially related to the known diminution of the human OR repertoire.

The process typically involves four basic steps: library preparation. cluster generation. sequencing. and data analysis. In 2015. a new chemistry of cluster generation was introduced in the newer Illumina machines (HiSeq 3000/4000/X Ten) called exclusion amplification (ExAmp). which was a fundamental shift from the earlier method of random cluster generation by bridge amplification on a non-patterned flow cell. The ExAmp chemistry. in conjunction with patterned flow cells containing nanowells at fixed locations. increases cluster density on the flow cell. thereby reducing the cost per run. It also increases sequence read quality. especially for longer read lengths (up to 150 base pairs). This advance has been widely adopted for genome sequencing because greater sequencing depth can be achieved for lower cost without compromising the quality of longer reads. We show that this promising chemistry is problematic. however. when multiplexing samples. We discovered that up to 5-10% of sequencing reads (or signals) are incorrectly assigned from a given sample to other samples in a multiplexed pool. We provide evidence that this “spreading-of-signals” arises from low levels of free index primers present in the pool. These index primers can prime pooled library fragments at random via complementary 3′ ends. and get extended by DNA polymerase. creating a new library molecule with a new index before …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:vofGIMt6cyEC,108,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/04/09/125724.full.pdf,4646478322261469482,/scholar?cites=4646478322261469482,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/04/09/125724.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here we combined gene targeting with an auxin-inducible degradation system to achieve rapid. titratable. and reversible control of Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4). a master regulator of centriole biogenesis. Depletion of Plk4 led to a failure of centriole duplication that produced an irreversible cell cycle arrest within a few divisions. This arrest was not a result of a prolonged mitosis. chromosome segregation errors. or cytokinesis failure. Depleting p53 allowed cells that fail centriole duplication to proliferate indefinitely. Washout of auxin and restoration of endogenous Plk4 levels in cells that lack centrioles led to the penetrant formation of de novo centrioles that gained the ability to organize microtubules and duplicate.

Soon. we anticipate being able to compare many different biological networks as we commonly do for molecular sequences. It has long been believed that many of these networks change. or “rewire”. at different rates. It is therefore important to develop a framework to quantify the differences between networks in a unified fashion. We developed such a formalism based on analogy to simple models of sequence evolution. and used it to conduct a systematic study of network rewiring on all the currently available biological networks. We found that. similar to sequences. biological networks show a decreased rate of change at large time divergences. because of saturation in potential substitutions. However. different types of biological networks consistently rewire at different rates. Using comparative genomics and proteomics data. we found a consistent ordering of the rewiring rates: transcription regulatory. phosphorylation regulatory. genetic interaction. miRNA regulatory. protein interaction. and metabolic pathway network. from fast to slow. This ordering was found in all comparisons we did of matched networks between organisms. To gain further intuition on network rewiring. we compared our observed rewirings with those obtained from simulation. We also investigated how readily our formalism could be mapped to other network contexts; in particular. we showed how it could be applied to analyze changes in a range of “commonplace” networks such as family trees. co-authorships and linux-kernel function dependencies.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC,103,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001050,7267095804795566215,/scholar?cites=7267095804795566215,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001050,0,0,0

The network. namely the integrated regulatory network. consists of three major types of regulation: TF→gene. TF→miRNA and miRNA→gene. We identified the target genes and target miRNAs for a set of TFs based on the ChIP-Seq binding profiles. the predicted targets of miRNAs using annotated 3′UTR sequences and conservation information. Making use of the system-wide RNA-Seq profiles. we classified transcription factors into positive and negative regulators and assigned a sign for each regulatory interaction. Other types of edges such as protein-protein interactions and potential intra-regulations between miRNAs based on the embedding of miRNAs in their host genes were further incorporated. We examined the topological structures of the network. including its hierarchical organization and motif enrichment. We found that transcription factors downstream of the hierarchy distinguish themselves by expressing more uniformly at various tissues. have more interacting partners. and are more likely to be essential. We found an over-representation of notable network motifs. including a FFL in which a miRNA cost-effectively shuts down a transcription factor and its target. We used data of C. elegans from the modENCODE project as a primary model to illustrate our framework. but further verified the results using other two data sets.

It has generated much excitement in functional genomics. To score data and determine adequate sequencing depth. both the genomic background and the binding sites must be properly modeled. To develop a computational foundation to tackle these issues. we first performed a study to characterize the observed statistical nature of this new type of high-throughput data. By linking sequence tags into clusters. we show that there are two components to the distribution of tag counts observed in a number of recent experiments: an initial power-law distribution and a subsequent long right tail. Then we develop in silico ChIP-seq. a computational method to simulate the experimental outcome by placing tags onto the genome according to particular assumed distributions for the actual binding sites and for the background genomic sequence. In contrast to current assumptions. our results show that both the background and the binding sites need to have a markedly nonuniform distribution in order to correctly model the observed ChIP-seq data. with. for instance. the background tag counts modeled by a gamma distribution. On the basis of these results. we extend an existing scoring approach by using a more realistic genomic-background model.

The sites of polarized growth were investigated in G1 arrested haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. When yeast cells are arrested during G1 either by treatment with alpha-factor or by shifting temperature-sensitive cdc28-1 cells to the restrictive temperature. the cells form a projection. Staining with Calcofluor reveals that in both cases the projection usually forms at axial sites (i.e.. next to the previous bud scar); these are the same sites where bud formation is expected to occur. These results indicate that sites of polarized growth are specified before the end of G1. Sites of polarized growth can be influenced by external conditions.

To generate a comprehensive view of the mechanisms controlling early hematopoietic precursor self-renewal and differentiation. we used systems-based approaches and murine EML multipotential hematopoietic precursor cells as a primary model. EML cells give rise to a mixture of self-renewing Lin-SCA+CD34+ cells and partially differentiated non-renewing Lin-SCA-CD34− cells in a cell autonomous fashion. We identified and validated the HMG box protein TCF7 as a regulator in this self-renewal/differentiation switch that operates in the absence of autocrine Wnt signaling. We found that Tcf7 is the most down-regulated transcription factor when CD34+ cells switch into CD34− cells. using RNA–Seq. We subsequently identified the target genes bound by TCF7. using ChIP–Seq. We show that TCF7 and RUNX1 (AML1) bind to each other's promoter regions and that TCF7 is necessary for the production of the short isoforms. but not the long isoforms of RUNX1. suggesting that TCF7 and the short isoforms of RUNX1 function coordinately in regulation. Tcf7 knock-down experiments and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses suggest that TCF7 plays a dual role in promoting the expression of genes characteristic of self-renewing CD34+ cells while repressing genes activated in partially differentiated CD34− state. Finally a network of up-regulated transcription factors of CD34+ cells was constructed.

Using a transposon-tagging strategy to globally analyze the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome for expressed genes. we identified multiple insertions in an open reading frame that is contained fully within and transcribed antisense to the 25S rRNA gene in the nuclear rDNA repeat region on Chromosome XII. Expression of this gene. TAR1(Transcript Antisense to Ribosomal RNA). can be detected at the RNA and protein levels. and the primary sequence of the corresponding 124-amino-acid protein is conserved in several yeast species.

Because the known human targets of these drugs do not exist in yeast. we could employ the yeast gene deletion collections and parallel fitness profiling to explore potential off-target effects in a genome-wide manner. Among 214 tested. documented psychoactive drugs. we identified 81 compounds that inhibited wild-type yeast growth and were thus selected for genome-wide fitness profiling. Many of these drugs had a propensity to affect multiple cellular functions. The sensitivity profiles of half of the analyzed drugs were enriched for core cellular processes such as secretion. protein folding. RNA processing. and chromatin structure. Interestingly. fluoxetine (Prozac) interfered with establishment of cell polarity. cyproheptadine (Periactin) targeted essential genes with chromatin-remodeling roles. while paroxetine (Paxil) interfered with essential RNA metabolism genes. suggesting potential secondary drug targets. We also found that the more recently developed atypical antipsychotic clozapine (Clozaril) had no fewer off-target effects in yeast than the typical antipsychotics haloperidol (Haldol) and pimozide (Orap).

In this study we developed an intuitive and yet powerful approach to analyze the distribution of regulatory elements found in many different ChIP–chip experiments on a 10∼100-kb scale. First. we focus on the overall chromosomal distribution of regulatory elements in the ENCODE regions and show that it is highly nonuniform. We demonstrate. in fact. that regulatory elements are associated with the location of known genes. Further examination on a local. single-gene scale shows an enrichment of regulatory elements near both transcription start and end sites.

Calcineurin promotes cell survival during stress by dephosphorylating and activating the Zn-finger transcription factor Crz1p/Tcn1p. Using a high-throughput assay. we screened 119 yeast kinases for their ability to phosphorylate Crz1p in vitro and identified the casein kinase I homolog Hrr25p. Here we show that Hrr25p negatively regulates Crz1p activity and nuclear localization in vivo. Hrr25p binds to and phosphorylates Crz1p in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of Hrr25p decreases Crz1p-dependent transcription and antagonizes its Ca2+-induced nuclear accumulation. In the absence of Hrr25p. activation of Crz1p by Ca2+/calcineurin is potentiated.

High levels of inbreeding lead to reduced genetic diversity and inbreeding depression. Various estimators based on different sources. e.g.. pedigree or genomic data. have been used to estimate inbreeding coefficients in cattle populations. However. the comparative advantage of using full sequence data to assess inbreeding is unknown. We used pedigree and genomic data at different densities from 50k to full sequence variants to compare how different methods performed for the estimation of inbreeding levels in three different cattle breeds. Five different estimates for inbreeding were calculated and compared in this study: pedigree based inbreeding coefficient (FPED); run of homozygosity (ROH)-based inbreeding coefficients (FROH); genomic relationship matrix (GRM)-based inbreeding coefficients (FGRM); inbreeding coefficients based on excess of homozygosity (FHOM) and correlation of uniting gametes (FUNI). Estimates using ROH provided the direct estimated levels of autozygosity in the current populations and are free effects of allele frequencies and incomplete pedigrees which may increase in inaccuracy in estimation of inbreeding. The highest correlations were observed between FROH estimated from the full sequence variants and the FROH estimated from 50k SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotypes. The estimator based on the correlation between uniting gametes (FUNI) using full genome sequences was also strongly correlated with FROH detected from sequence data.

Ltd.,Nutrients regulate the proliferation of many eukaryotic cells: in the absence of sufficient nutrients vegetatively growing cells will enter stationary (G0 like) phase; in the presence of sufficient nutrients non‐proliferative cells will begin growth. Previously we have shown that glucose is the critical nutrient which stimulates a variety of growth‐related events in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Granot and Snyder. 1991). This paper describes six new aspects of the induction of cell growth events by nutrients in S. cerevisiae. First. all carbon sources tested. both fermentable and non‐fermentable. induce growth‐related events in stationary phase cells. suggesting that the carbon source is the critical nutrient which stimulates growth. Second. the continuous presence of glucose is not necessary for the induction of growth events. but rather a short ‘pulse’ of glucose followed by an incubation period in water will induce growth …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,78,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/yea.320090503,15030093252433513922,/scholar?cites=15030093252433513922,,,0,0,0

In spite of considerable effort. a full understanding of the pathways they participate in remains elusive. We globally investigated the proteins that interact with the majority of yeast protein kinases using protein microarrays. Eighty-five kinases were purified and used to probe yeast proteome microarrays. One-thousand-twenty-three interactions were identified. and the vast majority were novel. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that many of these interactions occurred in vivo. Many novel links of kinases to previously distinct cellular pathways were discovered. For example. the well-studied Kss1 filamentous pathway was found to bind components of diverse cellular pathways. such as those of the stress response pathway and the Ccr4–Not transcriptional/translational regulatory complex; genetic tests revealed that these different components operate in …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C,77,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/25/7/767.short,16473861984363383226,/scholar?cites=16473861984363383226,,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/25/7/767.full.pdf,0,0,0

The other major cuticle proteins are still present. Protein and DNA sequence analyses indicate that point mutations cause two amino acid substitutions that change the electrophoretic mobility of CPf2 relative to that of CP2.

Cdc14 is regulated in both a spatial and temporal manner. It is sequestered in the nucleolus for most of the cell cycle by the nucleolar protein Net1 and is released into the nucleus and cytoplasm during anaphase. To identify novel binding partners of Cdc14. we used affinity purification of Cdc14 and mass spectrometric analysis of interacting proteins from strains in which Cdc14 localization or catalytic activity was altered. To alter Cdc14 localization. we used a strain deleted for NET1. which causes full release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus. To alter Cdc14 activity. we generated mutations in the active site of Cdc14 (C283S or D253A). which allow binding of substrates. but not dephosphorylation. by Cdc14.

We have studied the regulation of polarized growth using mating yeast as a model. Haploid yeast cells treated with high concentration of pheromone form successive mating projections that initiate and terminate growth with regular periodicity. The mechanisms that control the frequency of growth initiation and termination under these conditions are not well understood. We found that the polarisome components Spa2. Pea2. and Bni1 and the Cdc42 regulators Cdc24 and Bem3 control the timing and frequency of projection formation. Loss of polarisome components and mutation of Cdc24 decrease the frequency of projection formation. while loss of Bem3 increases the frequency of projection formation.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The segregation of the nucleolus during mitosis was examined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies directed to highly conserved anti‐nucleolus antigens. In mitotic S. pombe cells. the nucleolus appears to trail the bulk of the DNA. In wild‐type cells of S. cerevisiae. the nucleolus segregates alongside the bulk of the genomic DNA. Based on its distance from the centromere. we would expect the rDNA in both organisms to segregate behind the majority of the genomic DNA. if telomeric regions trail centromeric regions as in other eukaryotes. We therefore suggest that in S. cerevisiae the nucleolus is attached to other parts of the nucleus which enable it to segregate along with the bulk of the DNA.

However. there is still much uncertainty regarding precisely what portion of the genome is transcribed. the exact structures of these novel transcripts. and the levels of the transcripts produced. We have interrogated the transcribed loci in 420 selected ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) regions using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) sequencing. We analyzed annotated known gene regions. but primarily we focused on novel transcriptionally active regions (TARs). which were previously identified by high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays and on random regions that were not believed to be transcribed. We found RACE sequencing to be very sensitive and were able to detect low levels of transcripts in specific cell types that were not detectable by microarrays. We also observed many instances of sense-antisense transcripts; further analysis suggests that many of the antisense transcripts (but not all) may be artifacts generated from the reverse transcription reaction. Our results show that the majority of the novel TARs analyzed (60%) are connected to other novel TARs or known exons. Of previously unannotated random regions. 17% were shown to produce overlapping transcripts. Furthermore. it is estimated that 9% of the novel transcripts encode proteins.

A commonly used method for this purpose is a top-down approach based on clustering the network into a range of densely connected segments. treating these segments as expression modules. and extracting promoter motifs from these modules. Here. we describe a novel bottom-up approach to identify gene expression modules driven by known cis-regulatory motifs in the gene promoters. For a specific motif. genes in the co-expression network are ranked according to their probability of belonging to an expression module regulated by that motif. The ranking is conducted via motif enrichment or motif position bias analysis. Our results indicate that motif position bias analysis is an effective tool for genome-wide motif analysis. Sub-networks containing the top ranked genes are extracted and analyzed for inherent gene expression modules. This approach identified novel expression modules for the G-box.

STAT5 refers to two highly related proteins. STAT5A and STAT5B. with critical function: their complete deficiency is lethal in mice; in humans. STAT5B deficiency alone leads to endocrine and immunological problems. while STAT5A deficiency has not been reported. STAT5A and STAT5B show peptide sequence similarities greater than 90%. but subtle structural differences suggest possible non-redundant roles in gene regulation. However. these roles remain unclear in humans. We applied chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing using human CD4+ T cells to detect candidate genes regulated by STAT5A and/or STAT5B. and quantitative-PCR in STAT5A or STAT5B knock-down (KD) human CD4+ T cells to validate the findings.

Despite the status of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as arguably the most well-studied model eukaryote. we still do not have a full catalog or understanding of all its genes. In order to interrogate the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae for low abundance or rapidly turned over transcripts. we deleted elements of the RNA degradation machinery with the goal of preferentially increasing the relative abundance of such transcripts. We then used high-resolution tiling microarrays and ultra high–throughput sequencing (UHTS) to identify. map. and validate unannotated transcripts that are more abundant in the RNA degradation mutants relative to wild-type cells. We identified 365 currently unannotated transcripts. the majority presumably representing low abundance or short-lived RNAs. of which 185 are previously unknown and unique to this study. It is likely that many of these are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). which are rapidly degraded and whose function(s) within the cell are still unclear. while others may be novel functional transcripts.

However. the conventionally applied short-read sequencing platforms cannot be used to reliably distinguish between many transcript isoforms. The Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RS II platform is capable of reading long nucleic acid stretches in a single sequencing run. The pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an excellent system to study herpesvirus gene expression and potential interactions between the transcriptional units. In this work. non-amplified and amplified isoform sequencing protocols were used to characterize the poly(A+) fraction of the lytic transcriptome of PRV. with the aim of a complete transcriptional annotation of the viral genes. The analyses revealed a previously unrecognized complexity of the PRV transcriptome including the discovery of novel protein-coding and non-coding genes. novel mono- and polycistronic transcription units. as well as extensive transcriptional overlaps between neighboring and distal genes. This study identified non-coding transcripts overlapping all three replication origins of the PRV. which might play a role in the control of DNA synthesis. We additionally established the relative expression levels of gene products. Our investigations revealed that the whole PRV genome is utilized for transcription. including both DNA strands in all coding and intergenic regions. The genome-wide occurrence of transcript overlaps suggests a crosstalk between genes through a network formed by interacting transcriptional machineries with a potential function in the control of gene expression.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:I9gX6wnfuA8C,53,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162868,5258221709776097592,/scholar?cites=5258221709776097592,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162868,0,0,0

A major goal of pediatric cancer research has been to identify key drivers of tumorigenesis to eventually develop targeted therapies to enhance cure rate and minimize acute and long-term toxic effects. Here. we used genomic approaches to identify biomarkers and candidate drivers for fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC). a very rare subtype of pediatric liver cancer for which limited therapeutic options exist. In-depth genomic analyses of one tumor followed by immunohistochemistry validation on seven other tumors showed expression of neuroendocrine markers in FL-HCC.

However. for each allele. accurate interpretation of its effect will depend on both its penetrance and the trait's expressivity. In this regard. an important factor that can modify the effect of a pathogenic coding allele is its level of expression; a factor which itself characteristically changes across tissues. To better inform the degree to which pathogenic alleles can be modified by expression level across multiple tissues. we have conducted exome. RNA and deep. targeted allele-specific expression (ASE) sequencing in ten tissues obtained from a single individual. By combining such data. we report the impact of rare and common loss-of-function variants on allelic expression exposing stronger allelic bias for rare stop-gain variants and informing the extent to which rare deleterious coding alleles are consistently expressed across tissues.

The observation period includes two episodes of viral infection: a human rhinovirus and a respiratory syncytial virus. The profile studies give an informative snapshot into the biological functioning of an organism. We hypothesize that pathway expression levels are associated with disease status. To test this hypothesis. we use biological pathways to integrate metabolomics and proteomics iPOP data. The approach computes the pathways’ differential expression levels at each time point. while taking into account the pathway structure and the longitudinal design. The resulting pathway levels show strong association with the disease status. Further. we identify temporal patterns in metabolite expression levels. The changes in metabolite expression levels also appear to be consistent with the disease status. The results of the integrative analysis suggest that changes in biological pathways may be used to predict and monitor the disease.

Our analysis detected 34 formerly unidentified protein-coding genes. ten non-coding RNAs. as well as 17 polycistronic and complex transcripts. This work also led us to identify many transcript isoforms. including 13 splice and 68 transcript end variants. as well as several transcript overlaps. Additionally. we determined previously unascertained transcriptional start and polyadenylation sites. We analyzed the transcriptional activity from the complementary DNA strand in five convergent HSV gene pairs with quantitative RT-PCR and detected antisense RNAs in each gene. This part of the study revealed an inverse correlation between the expressions of convergent partners. Our work adds new insights for understanding the complexity of the pervasive transcriptional overlaps by suggesting that there is a crosstalk between adjacent and distal genes through interaction between their transcription apparatuses. We also identified transcripts overlapping the HSV replication origins. which may indicate an interplay between the transcription and replication machineries.

Ltd,With the cost of DNA sequencing decreasing rapidly. it is likely that the genome sequences of many individuals will be determined. In fact. if half of the individuals in industrialized countries choose to have their genomes sequenced. then well over 500 million personal genome sequences will be determined. Currently. such genetic information is likely to be of limited value to the individual. as the number of loci that provide useful predictive information is quite small (probably less than 200). Indeed. recent analyses of common complex traits such as diabetes. body mass and height show that in each case the genetically identifiable contribution from multiple candidate loci (18 in the case of diabetes) is only a small percentage (less than 7%) of the total identifiable genetic load (Gaulton et al. 2008; Willer et al. 2009); thus. the interpretable genetic contributions that can be identified are quite minor.

Using validated chemogenomic assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. we discovered that two closely related compounds. an imidazo[1.2-a]pyridine and -pyrimidine that differ by a single atom. have distinctly different mechanisms of action in vivo. 2-phenyl-3-nitroso-imidazo[1.2-a]pyridine was toxic to yeast strains with defects in electron transport and mitochondrial functions and caused mitochondrial fragmentation. suggesting that compound 13 acts by disrupting mitochondria.

30673,The [URE3] prion is not conserved among Saccharomyces species,2005.0,Nicolas Talarek and Laurent Maillet and Christophe Cullin and Michel Aigle,171.0,Genetics,1,23-34,Genetics,The [URE3] prion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a self-propagating inactive form of the nitrogen catabolism regulator Ure2p. To determine whether the [URE3] prion is conserved in S. cerevisiae-related yeast species. we have developed genetic tools allowing the detection of [URE3] in Saccharomyces paradoxus and Saccharomyces uvarum. We found that [URE3] is conserved in S. uvarum. In contrast. [URE3] was not detected in S. paradoxus. The inability of S. paradoxus Ure2p to switch to a prion isoform results from the primary sequence of the protein and not from the lack of cellular cofactors as heterologous Ure2p can propagate [URE3] in this species. Our data therefore demonstrate that [URE3] is conserved only in a subset of Saccharomyces species. Implications of our finding on the physiological and evolutionary meaning of the yeast [URE3] prion are discussed.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:43LB_KcVqeAC,44,https://www.genetics.org/content/171/1/23.short,5422416046950646220,/scholar?cites=5422416046950646220,,https://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/171/1/23.full.pdf,0,0,0

Thus. a large fraction of genes that are silenced on the inactive X chromosome are hypomethylated in their promoter regions. These genes frequently belong to the evolutionarily younger strata of the X chromosome.

We analyzed three of the constructed recombinant viruses that contained the transposon within the M25. M27. and m155 open reading frames. Our studies provide the first direct evidence to suggest that M25 and M27 are not essential for viral replication in mouse NIH 3T3 cells. Studies in cultured cells and Balb/c mice indicated that the transposon insertion is stable during viral propagation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover the virus that contained the insertion mutation in M25 exhibited a titer similar to that of the wild-type virus in the salivary glands. lungs. livers. spleens. and kidneys of the Balb/c mice that were intraperitoneally infected with these viruses. These results suggest that M25 is dispensable for viral growth in these organs and the presence of the transposon sequence in the viral genome does not significantly affect viral replication in vivo. The Tn3-based system can be used as a mutagenesis approach for studying the function of MCMV genes in both tissue culture and in animals.© 2000 Academic Press,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC,42,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82774802.pdf,10551007809865121873,/scholar?cites=10551007809865121873,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82774802.pdf,0,0,0

A single mutagenesis generates a large spectrum of alleles. including null. hypomorphic. and conditional alleles. reporter fusions. and epitope-insertion alleles. The system. therefore. provides the basis for a wide variety of studies of gene and protein function. The chapter provides comprehensive instructions for use of the new transposons to mutagenize a gene of interest. and for use of the transposon insertion libraries to mutagenize the yeast genome.

However. other mechanisms by which PU.1 affects the fate of erythroid progenitors have not been thoroughly explored. Here. we used ChIP-Seq analysis for PU.1 and gene expression profiling in erythroid cells to show that PU.1 regulates an extensive network of genes that constitute major pathways for controlling growth and survival of immature erythroid cells. By analyzing fetal liver erythroid progenitors from mice with low PU.1 expression. we also show that the earliest erythroid committed cells are dramatically reduced in vivo. Furthermore. we find that PU.1 also regulates many of the same genes and pathways in other blood cells. leading us to propose that PU.1 is a multifaceted factor with overlapping. as well as distinct. functions in several hematopoietic lineages.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC,41,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001392,16001060786341517061,/scholar?cites=16001060786341517061,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001392,0,0,0

Early gestation embryo loss or malformation has been linked to yolk sac vasculopathy and congenital heart defects (CHDs). However. the molecular pathways that underlie these structural defects in humans remain largely unknown hindering the development of molecular-based diagnostic tools and novel therapies.  Methodology/Principal Findings Murine embryos were exposed to high glucose. a condition known to induce cardiovascular defects in both animal models and humans. We further employed a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify proteins differentially expressed in embryos with defects from those with normal cardiovascular development. The proteins detected by mass spectrometry (WNT16. ST14. Pcsk1. Jumonji. Morca2a. TRPC5. and others) were validated by Western blotting and immunoflorescent staining of the yolk sac and heart. The proteins within the proteomic dataset clustered to adhesion/migration. differentiation. transport. and insulin signaling pathways. A functional role for several proteins (WNT16.

Despite its increasing prevalence worldwide. the molecular etiology of DM-linked skeletal complications remains poorly defined. Using advanced stem cell characterization techniques. we analyzed intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of mouse skeletal stem cell (mSSC) function to identify specific mSSC niche–related abnormalities that could impair skeletal repair in diabetic (Db) mice. We discovered that high serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor–α directly repressed the expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) in mSSCs and in their downstream skeletogenic progenitors in Db mice. When hedgehog signaling was inhibited during fracture repair. injury-induced mSSC expansion was suppressed. resulting in impaired healing.

It is caused by mutations in the Autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. which promote thymic display of thousands of peripheral tissue antigens in a process critical for establishing central immune tolerance. We here used proteome arrays to perform a comprehensive study of autoimmune targets in APS1. Interrogation of established autoantigens revealed highly reliable detection of autoantibodies. and by exploring the full panel of more than 9000 proteins we further identified MAGEB2 and PDILT as novel major autoantigens in APS1. Our proteome-wide assessment revealed a marked enrichment for tissue-specific immune targets. mirroring AIRE’s selectiveness for this category of genes.

Ltd.,Synthetic genes that confer resistance to the antibiotic nourseothricin in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans are available. but genes conferring resistance to other antibiotics are not. We found that multiple C. albicans strains were inhibited by hygromycin B. so we designed a 1026 bp gene (CaHygB) that encodes Escherichia coli hygromycin B phosphotransferase with C. albicans codons. CaHygB conferred hygromycin B resistance in C. albicans transformed with ars2‐containing plasmids or single‐copy integrating vectors. Since CaHygB did not confer nourseothricin resistance and since the nourseothricin resistance marker SAT‐1 did not confer hygromycin B resistance. we reasoned that these two markers could be used for homologous gene disruptions in wild‐type C. albicans. We used PCR to fuse CaHygB or SAT‐1 to approximately 1 kb of 5′ and 3′ noncoding DNA from C. albicans ARG4.

As compared to mutations generated by classical methods of chemical treatment and ultraviolet irradiation. transposon insertions are easy to identify: the transposon-encoded sequence serves as a marker or tag through which sites of insertion may be rapidly identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification or plasmid rescue. Additionally. transposon insertion alleles can be uniquely informative: a single insertion may be sufficient to generate a gene disruption. reporter gene fusion. epitope-tagged allele. and conditional mutation. Transposons. if engineered appropriately. may also serve as gene traps identifying novel coding sequences.

30747,ChIP-Seq: using high-throughput DNA sequencing for genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding sites,2010.0,Philippe Lefrançois and Wei Zheng and Michael Snyder,470.0,,,77-104,Academic Press,Much of eukaryotic gene regulation is mediated by binding of transcription factors near or within their target genes. Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are often identified globally using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in which specific protein–DNA interactions are isolated using an antibody against the factor of interest. Coupling ChIP with high-throughput DNA sequencing allows identification of TFBS in a direct. unbiased fashion; this technique is termed ChIP-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq). In this chapter. we describe the yeast ChIP-Seq procedure. including the protocols for ChIP. input DNA preparation. and Illumina DNA sequencing library preparation. Descriptions of Illumina sequencing and data processing and analysis are also included.

Here we categorize this large amount of “unannotated transcription.” We use a number of disparate features to classify the 6988 novel TARs—array expression profiles across cell lines and conditions. sequence composition. phylogenetic profiles (presence/absence of syntenic conservation across 17 species). and locations relative to genes. In the classification. we first filter out TARs with unusual sequence composition and those likely resulting from cross-hybridization. We then associate some of those remaining with proximal exons having correlated expression profiles.

The less abundant long RNA molecule (CTO-L) is a transcriptional readthrough product of the ul21 gene and overlaps OriL. These polyadenylated RNAs were characterized by ascertaining their nucleotide sequences with the Illumina HiScanSQ and Pacific Biosciences Real-Time (PacBio RSII) sequencing platforms and by analyzing their transcription kinetics through use of multi-time-point Real-Time RT-PCR and the PacBio RSII system. It emerged that transcription of the CTOs is fully dependent on the viral transactivator protein IE180 and CTO-S is not a microRNA precursor.

Genetic association studies of transplantation outcomes have been hampered by small samples and highly complex multifactorial phenotypes. hindering investigations of the genetic architecture of a range of comorbidities which significantly impact graft and recipient life expectancy. We describe here the rationale and design of the International Genetics & Translational Research in Transplantation Network. The network comprises 22 studies to date. including 16 494 transplant recipients and 11 669 donors. of whom more than 5000 are of non-European ancestry. all of whom have existing genomewide genotype data sets. Methods. We describe the rich genetic and phenotypic information available in this consortium comprising heart. kidney. liver. and lung transplant cohorts. Results. We demonstrate significant power in International Genetics & Translational Research in Transplantation Network to detect main effect association signals across regions such as the MHC region as well as genomewide for transplant outcomes that span all solid organs. such as graft survival. acute rejection. new onset of diabetes after transplantation. and for delayed graft function in kidney only. Conclusions. This consortium is designed and statistically powered to deliver pioneering insights into the genetic architecture of transplant-related outcomes across a range of different solid-organ transplant studies. The study design allows a spectrum of analyses to be performed including recipient-only analyses. donor-recipient HLA mismatches with focus on loss-of-function variants and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:4QKQTXcH0q8C,23,https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/design-and-implementation-of-the-international-genetics-and-trans,1087329703719980487,/scholar?cites=1087329703719980487,,https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/design-and-implementation-of-the-international-genetics-and-trans,0,0,0

We have used this system to screen for genes necessary for neural lineage development by using a pooled human short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library screen and massively parallel sequencing. We confirmed known genes and identified several unpredicted genes with interrelated functions that were specifically required for the formation or survival of neuronal progenitor cells without interfering with the self-renewal capacity of undifferentiated hESCs. Among these are several genes that have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders (i.e.. brain malformations. mental retardation. and autism).

Whereas avian myeloblastosis virus elicits a relatively immature phenotype. cells transformed by MC29 resemble mature macrophages. When cells previously transformed by v-myb were superinfected with MC29. their phenotype was rapidly altered to that of a more mature cell. These superinfected cells expressed both v-myb (at a level similar to that found before superinfection) and v-myc. It therefore appears that the expression of v-myc can elicit certain properties of a more differentiated phenotype. In addition. unlike cells transformed by v-myb alone. the cells expressing both v-myb and v-myc could not be induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate to differentiate to fully mature macrophages.

Genetic risk factors for IBD are not well understood.

Biochemical assays of the de novo and rare (minor allele frequency. MAF < 0.01) mutation variant proteins further validated the predicted deleterious effects of the identified alleles. In the proband of Family A. we found a heterozygous de novo mutation (c.830C > T; p.Ser277Leu) in HSPA1L. Through analysis of WES data of 136 patients. we identified five additional rare HSPA1L mutations (p.Gly77Ser. p.Leu172del. p.Thr267Ile. p.Ala268Thr. p.Glu558Asp) in six patients. In contrast. rare HSPA1L mutations were not observed in controls. and were significantly enriched in patients (P = 0.02). Interestingly. we did not find non-synonymous rare mutations in the HSP70 isoforms HSPA1A and HSPA1B. Biochemical assays revealed that all six rare HSPA1L variant proteins showed decreased chaperone activity in vitro.

We demonstrated that the amino acid sequence lacked the cytoplasmic domain and was consistent with the primary sequence reported for EGFR purified from a human plasma pool. One of the sEGFR forms. attributed to the alternative RNA splicing. was also confirmed by transcriptional analysis (RNA sequencing). Two unusual types of glycan structures were observed in sEGFR as compared with membrane-bound EGFR from the A431 cell line. The unusual glycan structures were di-sialylated glycans (sialic acid attached to sialic acid) at Asn-151 and N-acetylhexosamine attached to a branched fucosylated galactose with N-acetylglucosamine moieties (HexNAc-(Fuc)Gal-GlcNAc) at Asn-420. These unusual glycans at specific sites were either present at a much lower level or were not observable in membrane-bound EGFR present in the A431 cell lysate. The observation of these di-sialylated glycan structures was consistent with the observed expression of the corresponding α-N-acetylneuraminide α-2.8-sialyltransferase 2 (ST8SiA2) and α-N-acetylneuraminide α-2.8-sialyltransferase 4 (ST8SiA4). by quantitative real time RT-PCR.

Recently. there has been great excitement in the development of many technologies for this (e.g. medium and short read sequencing from companies such as 454 and SOLiD. and high-density oligo-arrays from Affymetrix and NimbelGen). with even more expected to appear. The costs and sensitivities of these technologies differ considerably from each other. As an important goal of personal genomics is to reduce the cost of re-sequencing to an affordable point. it is worthwhile to consider optimally integrating technologies. Here. we build a simulation toolbox that will help us optimally combine different technologies for genome re-sequencing. especially in reconstructing large structural variants (SVs). SV reconstruction is considered the most challenging step in human genome re-sequencing. (It is sometimes even harder than de novo assembly of small genomes because of the duplications and repetitive sequences in the human genome.) To this end. we formulate canonical problems that are representative of issues in reconstruction and are of small enough scale to be computationally tractable and simulatable. Using semi-realistic simulations. we show how we can combine different technologies to optimally solve the assembly at low cost. With mapability maps. our simulations efficiently handle the inhomogeneous repeat-containing structure of the human genome and the computational complexity of practical assembly algorithms.

MA,Antibodies can be used as probes to isolate directly a particular gene of interest. A recombinant DNA library is first constructed in an Escherichia coli expression vector. and foreign antigens are expressed in E. coli from the DNA inserts. The antigens produced are transferred onto nitrocellulose filters and then probed with antibody to detect the desired recombinant. This approach is rapid. and is particularly useful for isolating genes that are expressed at a low level and therefore are difficult to isolate using techniques employing nucleic acid probes (see Ref. 1) or by hybrid/selection methods.2 This chapter describes methods for isolating eukaryotic genes by constructing and screening E. coli expression vector libraries with antibody probes using the bacteriophage expression vector λgt11.3.4 ,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:NMlhSUseqAsC,18,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-4964-8_24,10392761169449929442,/scholar?cites=10392761169449929442,,,0,0,0

In this regard. currently two LRS platforms have demonstrated adequate performance: the Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and the nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Even though these techniques produce lower coverage and are more error prone than short-read sequencing. they continue to be more successful in identifying polycistronic RNAs. transcript isoforms including splice and transcript end variants. as well as transcript overlaps. Recent reports have successfully applied LRS for the investigation of the transcriptome of viruses belonging to various families. These studies have substantially increased the number of previously known viral RNA molecules. In this work. we used the Sequel and MinION technique from PacBio and ONT. respectively. to characterize the lytic transcriptome of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In most samples. we analyzed the poly(A) fraction of the transcriptome. but we also performed random oligonucleotide-based sequencing. Besides cDNA sequencing. we also carried out native RNA sequencing. Our investigations identified more than 2.300 previously undetected transcripts. including coding and non-coding RNAs. multi-splice transcripts. as well as polycistronic and complex transcripts.

30827,Topological organization and dynamic regulation of human tRNA genes during macrophage differentiation,2017.0,Kevin Van Bortle and Douglas H Phanstiel and Michael P Snyder,18.0,Genome biology,1,1-18,BioMed Central,The human genome is hierarchically organized into local and long-range structures that help shape cell-type-specific transcription patterns. Transfer RNA (tRNA) genes (tDNAs). which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) and encode RNA molecules responsible for translation. are dispersed throughout the genome and. in many cases. linearly organized into genomic clusters with other tDNAs. Whether the location and three-dimensional organization of tDNAs contribute to the activity of these genes has remained difficult to address. due in part to unique challenges related to tRNA sequencing. We therefore devised integrated tDNA expression profiling. a method that combines RNAPIII mapping with biotin-capture of nascent tRNAs. We apply this method to the study of dynamic tRNA gene regulation during macrophage development and further integrate these data with high-resolution maps of 3D chromatin structure. Integrated tDNA expression profiling reveals domain-level and loop-based organization of tRNA gene transcription during cellular differentiation. tRNA genes connected by DNA loops. which are proximal to CTCF binding sites and expressed at elevated levels compared to non-loop tDNAs. change coordinately with tDNAs and protein-coding genes at distal ends of interactions mapped by in situ Hi-C. We find that downregulated tRNA genes are specifically marked by enhanced promoter-proximal binding of MAF1. a transcriptional repressor of RNAPIII activity. altogether revealing multiple levels of tDNA regulation during cellular differentiation.

They used a method that does not target specific regions of chromosomes 18 and 21. and they provided evidence to show that maternal copy-number variants may have interfered with the assessment of fetal aneuploidy. Two aspects of the design of targeted assays such as Digital Analysis of Selected Regions (DANSR) 2 reduce the effect of maternal copy-number variants in assessment of the risk of fetal aneuploidy. First. they target chromosome locations that have not been observed to harbor common copy-number variants. Second. the Fetal-fraction Optimized Risk of Trisomy Evaluation (FORTE) algorithm dynamically compares chromosome quantitation with the estimated fetal fraction for each assay and masks assays of outlier regions. 3 In Figure 1. we show four examples in which appropriate low-risk reports were generated with the use of the FORTE algorithm despite the presence of rare maternal copy-number variants ranging from 1.4 to 7.4 Mb.

While many experiments rely on such oligos. the hybridization behavior of various degrees of mismatch (MM) structure has not been extensively studied. Here. we present the results of two large-scale microarray experiments on S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens genomic DNA. to explore MM oligonucleotide behavior with real sample mixtures under tiling-array conditions. We examined all possible nucleotide substitutions at the central position of 36-nucleotide probes. and found that nonspecific binding by MM oligos depends upon the individual nucleotide substitutions they incorporate: C→A. C→G and T→A (yielding purine-purine mispairs) are most disruptive. whereas A→X were least disruptive. We also quantify a marked GC skew effect: substitutions raising probe GC content exhibit higher intensity (and vice versa). This skew is small in highly-expressed regions (± 0.5% of total intensity range) and large (± 2% or more) elsewhere. Multiple mismatches per oligo are largely additive in effect: each MM added in a distributed fashion causes an additional 21% intensity drop relative to PM. three-fold more disruptive than adding adjacent mispairs (7% drop per MM). We investigate several parameters for oligonucleotide design. including the effects of each central nucleotide substitution on array signal intensity and of multiple MM per oligo. To avoid GC skew. individual substitutions should not alter probe GC content.

However. both the molecular targets and the biological pathways affected by metformin in bone are not well identified or characterized. The objective of this study is to investigate the bioengergeric pathways affected by metformin in bone marrow cells of mice.   Materials and Methods Metabolite levels were examined in bone marrow samples extracted from metformin or PBS -treated healthy (Wild type) and hyperglycemic (diabetic) mice using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. We applied an untargeted high performance LC-MS approach which combined multimode chromatography (ion exchange. reversed phase and hydrophilic interaction (HILIC)) and Orbitrap-based ultra-high accuracy mass spectrometry to achieve a wide coverage. A multivariate clustering was applied to reveal the global trends and major metabolite players.   Results A total of 346 unique metabolites were identified. and they are grouped into distinctive clusters that reflected general and diabetes-specific responses to metformin. As evidenced by changes in the TCA and urea cycles. increased catabolism and nitrogen waste that are commonly associated with diabetes were rebalanced upon treatment with metformin.

Many studies focus on inferring the function of an unknown gene from its co-expressed genes. Here. we are able to show that there are two types of positional artifacts in microarray data introducing spurious correlations between genes. First. we find that genes that are close on the microarray chips tend to have higher correlations between their expression profiles. We call this the ‘chip artifact’. Our calculations suggest that the carry-over during the printing process is one of the major sources of this type of artifact. which is later confirmed by our experiments. Based on our experiments. the measured intensity of a microarray spot contains 0.1% (for fully-hybridized spots) to 93% (for un-hybridized ones) of noise resulting from this artifact.

The roles of NF90 and NF110 in regulating transcription as chromatin-interacting proteins have not been comprehensively characterized. Here. chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) identified 9.081 genomic sites specifically occupied by NF90/NF110 in K562 cells. One third of NF90/NF110 peaks occurred at promoters of annotated genes. NF90/NF110 occupancy colocalized with chromatin marks associated with active promoters and strong enhancers. Comparison with 150 ENCODE ChIP-seq experiments revealed that NF90/NF110 clustered with transcription factors exhibiting preference for promoters over enhancers (POLR2A. MYC. YY1). Differential gene expression analysis following shRNA knockdown of NF90/NF110 in K562 cells revealed that NF90/NF110 activates transcription factors that drive growth and proliferation (EGR1.

Curiously. transcripts lacking 5′UTR introns tend to harbor specific RNA sequence elements in their early coding regions. To model and understand the connection between coding-region sequence and 5′UTR intron status. we developed a classifier that can predict 5′UTR intron status with >80% accuracy using only sequence features in the early coding region. Thus. the classifier identifies transcripts with 5′ proximal-intron-minus-like-coding regions (“5IM” transcripts).

We quantified the relative protein levels from over 12.000 genes across 32 normal human tissues. Tissue-specific or tissue-enriched proteins were identified and compared to transcriptome data. Many ubiquitous transcripts are found to encode tissue-specific proteins. Discordance of RNA and protein enrichment revealed potential sites of synthesis and action of secreted proteins. The tissue-specific distribution of proteins also provides an in-depth view of complex biological events that require the interplay of multiple tissues.

Paradoxically. disrupting the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) at the level of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) protects cells against ROS.

As of today. short-read RNA sequencing is more widely used. and due to its low price and high throughput. is the preferred tool for the quantitative analysis of gene expression. However. the annotation of transcript isoforms is rather difficult using only short-read sequencing data. because the reads are shorter than most transcripts (Steijger et al.. 2013). Long-read sequencing. on the other hand. can provide full contig information about transcripts. including exon-connectivity. and its merits in transcriptome profiling are being increasingly acknowledged (Sharon et al.. 2013; Abdel-Ghany et al.. 2016; Wang et al.. 2016; Kuo et al.. 2017). Due to the relatively low throughput of current long-read sequencing technologies. they can only characterize smaller transcriptomes in high-depth (Weirather et al.. 2017). The Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous betaherpesvirus. which can cause mononucleosis-like symptoms in adults (Cohen and Corey. 1985). and severe life-threatening infections in newborns (Wen et al.. 2002). Latent HCMV infection has recently been implicated to affect cancer formation (Dziurzynski et al.. 2012; Jin et al.. 2014). Examining the transcriptome of the virus can go a long way in helping understand its molecular biology. Short-read RNA sequencing studies have discovered splice junctions and non-coding transcripts (Gatherer et al.. 2011) and have shown that the most abundant HCMV transcripts are similarly expressed in different cell types (Cheng et al.. 2017).

However. the morphological patterns associated with the molecular subtypes have not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap. we developed a quantitative histopathology analytic framework to identify the gene expression subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer objectively. We processed whole-slide histopathology images of lung adenocarcinoma (n=427) and lung squamous cell carcinoma patients (n=457) in The Cancer Genome Atlas. To establish neural networks for quantitative image analyses. we first build convolutional neural network models to identify tumor regions from adjacent dense benign tissues (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) > 0.935) and recapitulated expert pathologists’ diagnosis (AUC > 0.88). with the results validated in an independent cohort (n=125; AUC > 0.85). We further demonstrated that quantitative histopathology morphology features identified the major transcriptomic subtypes of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.01). Our study is the first to classify the transcriptomic subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer using fully-automated machine learning methods.

In contrast. the complex patterns of dispersed regulation and pervasive transcription uncovered by the ENCODE project. together with non-genic conservation and the abundance of noncoding RNA genes. have challenged the notion of the gene. To illustrate this. we review the evolution of operational definitions of a gene over the past century—from the abstract elements of heredity of Mendel and Morgan to the present-day ORFs enumerated in the sequence databanks. We then summarize the current ENCODE findings and provide a computational metaphor for the complexity. Finally. we propose a tentative update to the definition of a gene: A gene is a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. Our definition sidesteps the complexities of regulation and transcription by removing the former altogether from the definition and arguing that final. functional gene products (rather than intermediate transcripts) should be used to group together entities associated with a single gene.

The organization of microtubules and their roles during the yeast cell cycle are diagrammatically represented in the chapter. This chapter discusses the role of proteins that coassemble with Tub4p in the yeast γ-tubulin complex. The Tub4p complex binds to the nuclear face of the SPB by its association with Nuf1p/Spc110p. The intermolecular interactions within the γ-tubulin complex and between the complex and the SPB are extremely well characterized in yeast. This system is useful in elucidating the mechanisms that regulate Tub4p function during microtubule …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C,8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0070215399490052,9694906254228490909,/scholar?cites=9694906254228490909,,,0,0,0

Measurements of gene dependency across hundreds of cell lines have been used to cluster genes into co-essential pathways. but this approach has been limited by ubiquitous false positives. Here. we develop a statistical method that enables robust identification of gene co-essentiality and yields a genome-wide set of functional modules. This almanac recapitulates diverse pathways and protein complexes and predicts the functions of 102 uncharacterized genes. Validating top predictions. we show that TMEM189 encodes plasmanylethanolamine desaturase. the long-sought key enzyme for plasmalogen synthesis. We also show that C15orf57 binds the AP2 complex. localizes to clathrin-coated pits. and enables efficient transferrin uptake. Finally. we provide an interactive web tool for the community to explore the results (coessentiality.net).

One of the annotated genes encodes LMOD1 (Leiomodin 1). a member of the actin filament nucleator family that is highly enriched in smooth muscle-containing tissues such as the artery wall. However. it is still unknown whether LMOD1 is the causal gene at this locus and also how the associated variants alter LMOD1 expression/function and CAD risk. Using epigenomic profiling we recently identified a non-coding regulatory variant. rs34091558. which is in tight linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the lead CAD GWAS variant. rs2820315. Herein we demonstrate through expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and statistical fine-mapping in GTEx. STARNET. and human coronary artery smooth muscle cell (HCASMC) datasets. rs34091558 is the top regulatory variant for LMOD1 in vascular tissues. Position weight matrix (PWM) analyses identify the protective allele rs34091558-TA to form a conserved Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) binding motif. which is disrupted by the risk allele rs34091558-A. FOXO3 chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays show reduced FOXO3 binding and LMOD1 transcriptional activity by the risk allele. consistent with effects of FOXO3 downregulation on LMOD1. LMOD1 knockdown results in increased proliferation and migration and decreased cell contraction in HCASMC. and immunostaining in atherosclerotic lesions in the SMC lineage tracing reporter mouse support a key role for LMOD1 in maintaining the differentiated SMC phenotype …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:jtOrAYjvdewC,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007755,6928257024943950328,/scholar?cites=6928257024943950328,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007755,0,0,0

We describe a novel bottom-up approach to identify gene modules regulated by cis-regulatory motifs from a human gene co-expression network. Target genes of a cis-regulatory motif were identified from the network via the motif’s enrichment or biased distribution towards transcription start sites in the promoters of co-expressed genes. A gene sub-network containing the target genes was extracted and used to derive gene modules. The analysis revealed known and novel gene modules regulated by the NF-Y motif. The binding of NF-Y proteins to these modules’ gene promoters were verified using ENCODE ChIP-Seq data.

NY,Transcription factors influence gene expression through their ability to bind DNA at specific regulatory elements. Specific DNA-protein interactions can be isolated through the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) procedure. in which DNA fragments bound by the protein of interest are recovered. ChIP is followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (Seq) to determine the genomic provenance of ChIP DNA fragments and their relative abundance in the sample. This chapter describes a ChIP-Seq strategy adapted for budding yeast to enable the genome-wide characterization of binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) and other DNA-binding proteins in an efficient and cost-effective way.Yeast strains with epitope-tagged TFs are most commonly used for ChIP-Seq. along with their matching untagged control strains.

Using smartwatch data from 31 infected individuals identified from a cohort of over 5000 participants. we investigated the use of wearables for early. presymptomatic detection of COVID-19. From physiological and activity data. we first demonstrate that COVID-19 infections are associated with alterations in heart rate. steps and sleep in 80% of COVID-19 infection cases.

Cloning and expression of metagenomic DNA in heterologous strains of bacteria has broadened the range of potential compounds accessible. However. such metagenomic libraries have been under-exploited for applications in mammalian cells because of a lack of integrated methods. We present an innovative platform to systematically mine natural resources for pro-apoptotic compounds that relies on the combination of bacterial delivery and droplet microfluidics. Using the violacein operon from C. violaceum as a model. we demonstrate that E. coli modified to be invasive can serve as an efficient delivery vehicle of natural compounds. This approach permits the seamless screening of metagenomic libraries with mammalian cell assays and alleviates the need for laborious extraction of natural compounds. In addition. we leverage the unique properties of droplet microfluidics to amplify bacterial clones and perform clonal screening at high-throughput in place of one-compound-per-well assays in multi-well format. We also use droplet microfluidics to establish a cell aggregate strategy that overcomes the issue of background apoptosis.

It can form a heterodimer with other epidermal growth factor receptor family members and activate kinase-mediated downstream signaling pathways. ERBB2 gene is located on chromosome 17 and is amplified in a subset of cancers. such as breast. gastric. and colon cancer. Of particular interest to the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) initiative is the amplification mechanism that typically results in overexpression of a set of genes adjacent to ERBB2. which provides evidence of a linkage between gene location and expression.

Molecular diagnostics for drug resistance that rely on the detection of resistance-related mutations could expedite patient care and accelerate progress in TB eradication. We performed minimum inhibitory concentration testing for 12 anti-TB drugs together with Illumina whole genome sequencing on 1452 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates. We then used a linear mixed model to evaluate genome wide associations between mutations in MTB genes or noncoding regions and drug resistance. followed by validation of our findings in an independent dataset of 792 patient isolates. Novel associations at 13 genomic loci were confirmed in the validation set. with 2 involving noncoding regions. We found promoter mutations to have smaller average effects on resistance levels than gene body mutations in genes where both can contribute to resistance. Enabled by a quantitative measure of resistance. we estimated the heritability of the resistance phenotype to 11 anti-TB drugs and identify a lower than expected contribution from known resistance genes. We also report the proportion of variation in resistance levels explained by the novel loci identified here.

Berlin. Heidelberg,In this paper we consider several variations of the following basic tiling problem: given a sequence of real numbers with two size bound parameters. we want to find a set of tiles such that they satisfy the size bounds and the total weight of the tiles is maximized. This solution to this problem is important to a number of computational biology applications. such as selecting genomic DNA fragments for amplicon microarrays. or performing homology searches with long sequence queries. Our goal is to design efficient algorithms with linear or near-linear time and space in the normal range of parameter values for these problems. For this purpose. we discuss the solution of a basic online interval maximum problem via a sliding window approach and show how to use this solution in a nontrivial manner for many of our tiling problems.

While kinases often play key roles driving tumorigenesis. there are strikingly few kinases known to promote the development of SCLC. Here. we investigated the contribution of the MAPK module MEK5–ERK5 to SCLC growth. MEK5 and ERK5 were required for optimal survival and expansion of SCLC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomics analyses identified a role for the MEK5–ERK5 axis in the metabolism of SCLC cells. including lipid metabolism. In-depth lipidomics analyses showed that loss of MEK5/ERK5 perturbs several lipid metabolism pathways. including the mevalonate pathway that controls cholesterol synthesis. Notably. depletion of MEK5/ERK5 sensitized SCLC cells to pharmacologic inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by statins.

The parasite’s cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is essential at multiple steps of the life cycle. Phosphoproteomic studies in Plasmodium falciparum erythrocytic stages and Plasmodium berghei ookinetes have identified proteolysis as a major biological pathway dependent on PKG activity. To further understand PKG’s mechanism of action. we screened a yeast two-hybrid library for P. falciparum proteins that interact with P. falciparum PKG (PfPKG) and tested peptide libraries to identify its phosphorylation site preferences.

Early in prophase. chromosomes associate in mostly non-homologous pairs. tethered only at their centromeres. This phenomenon. conserved through higher eukaryotes. is termed centromere coupling in budding yeast. Both initiation of recombination and the presence of homologs are dispensable for centromere coupling (occurring in spo11 mutants and haploids induced to undergo meiosis) but the presence of the synaptonemal complex (SC) protein Zip1 is required. The nature and mechanism of coupling have yet to be elucidated. Here we present the first pairwise analysis of centromere coupling in an effort to uncover underlying rules that may exist within these non-homologous interactions. We designed a novel chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based assay to detect all possible interactions between non-homologous yeast centromeres during early meiosis. Using this variant of 3C-qPCR. we found a size-dependent interaction pattern. in which chromosomes assort preferentially with chromosomes of similar sizes. in haploid and diploid spo11 cells. but not in a coupling-defective mutant (spo11 zip1 haploid and diploid yeast). This pattern is also observed in wild-type diploids early in meiosis but disappears as meiosis progresses and homologous chromosomes pair. We found no evidence to support the notion that ancestral centromere homology plays a role in pattern establishment in S. cerevisiae post-genome duplication.

To interpret the genome accurately requires a complete list of functionally important elements and a description of their dynamic activities over time and across different cell types. As well as genes for proteins and non-coding RNAs. functionally important elements include regulatory sequences that direct essential functions such as gene expression. DNA replication and chromosome inheritance.Although geneticists have been quick to decode the functional elements in the yeast S. cerevisiae. with its small compact genome and powerful experimental tools5–6. our understanding of the more complex genomes of human. mouse. fly and worm is still rudimentary.

30995,Transposons as tools,2001.0,SA Des Etages and A Kumar and M Snyder,,,,2034-2040,Academic Press,Transposons are ubiquitous mobile DNA elements that can relocate within the genome of their hosts. These elements generally have either inverted or direct repeats at their termini and encode enzymes important for transposition. Movement occurs either by duplication and insertion of the new copy into the genome (replicative) or by excision of an existing copy and insertion at a new site (nonreplicative). Insertion of the transposon causes duplication of the target site and therefore these elements are flanked by direct repeats. Retrotransposons are a class of transposons that contain long terminal repeats and use an RNA intermediate for transposition. These elements encode reverse transcriptase and integrase. enzymes required for their duplication and transposition. Early observations by McClintock and others indicated that transposons could mediate transfer of genetic material within and between species.

These technological advances and the associated data can have a great impact on biomedicine and healthcare. To answer many of the biologically or medically important questions. researchers often need to integrate data from a number of independent but related genome databases. One common practice is to download data sets (text files) from various genome Web sites and process them by some local programs. One main problem with this approach is that these programs are written on a case-by-case basis because the data sets involved are heterogeneous in structure.

Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is the causative agent of Aujeszky’s disease giving rise to significant economic losses worldwide. Many countries have implemented national programs for the eradication of this virus. In this study. long-read sequencing was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the genome of a novel PRV strain (PRV-MdBio) isolated in Serbia. Results. In this study. a novel PRV strain was isolated and characterized. PRV-MdBio was found to exhibit similar growth properties to those of another wild-type PRV. the strain Kaplan. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing has revealed that the new strain differs significantly in base composition even from strain Kaplan. to which it otherwise exhibits the highest similarity. We compared the genetic composition of PRV-MdBio to strain Kaplan and the China reference strain Ea and obtained that radical base replacements were the most common point mutations preceding conservative and silent mutations. We also found that the adaptation of PRV to cell culture does not lead to any tendentious genetic alteration in the viral genome. Conclusion.

31012,Cross-species blastocyst chimerism between nonhuman primates using iPSCs,2019.0,Morteza Roodgar and Fabian P Suchy and Vivek Bajpai and Jose G Viches-Moure and Joydeep Bhadury and Angelos Oikonomopoulos and Joseph C Wu and Joseph L Mankowski and Kyle M Loh and Hiromitsu Nakauchi and Catherine VandeVoort and Michael P Snyder,,bioRxiv,,635250,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Through the production of chimeric animals. induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can generate personalized organs with diverse applications for both basic research and translational medicine. This concept was first validated in rodents by forming a rat pancreas in mice and vice versa. However. the potential use of human iPSCs to generate xenogenic organs in other species is technically and ethically difficult. Recognizing these restrictions. we explored the generation of chimeric nonhuman primates (NHP) embryos. by injecting either chimpanzee or pig-tailed macaque iPSCs into rhesus macaque embryos. We first derived iPSCs from chimpanzees and pig-tailed macaques. We found that the chimpanzee iPSCs mixed well with human iPSCs during in vitro co-culture and differentiation. The differentiation of mixed human and chimpanzee iPSCs formed functioning cardiomyocyte layers in vitro. whereas human or chimpanzee iPSC mixed with pig-tailed macaque or mouse cells do not; these results indicate that chimpanzee and human cells are closely related in function. Considering the ethical aspects of injecting human iPSCs into nonhuman primate blastocysts. we tested whether chimpanzee iPSCs injected into 99 macaque 5-day-old embryos formed cross-species chimeras two days after injection. Strikingly. the chimpanzee iPSCs survived. proliferated and integrated near the inner cell mass (ICM) of rhesus macaque embryos. These findings highlight the broad potential of primate iPSCs in forming cross-species chimeras beyond rodents and provides a foundational basis for organ generation using human iPSCs.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:Q_E8KsG3g9MC,2,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/635250v1.abstract,11289000744524787458,/scholar?cites=11289000744524787458,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/05/11/635250.full.pdf,0,0,0

PRV has 67 protein-coding genes and several non-coding RNA molecules. which can be classified into three temporal groups. immediate early. early and late classes. The ul54 gene of PRV and its homolog icp27 of herpes simplex virus have a multitude of functions. including the regulation of viral DNA synthesis and the control of the gene expression. Therefore. abrogation of PRV ul54 function was expected to exert a significant effect on the global transcriptome and on DNA replication. Real-time PCR and real-time RT-PCR platforms were used to investigate these presumed effects.

The clusters are computed using co-abundance profiles within a set of reference metagnomes; unlike previous methods. GATTACA estimates these profiles from k-mer counts stored in a highly compact index. On multiple synthetic and real benchmark datasets. GATTACA produces clusters that correspond to distinct bacterial species with an accuracy that matches earlier methods. while being up to 20× faster when the reference panel index can be computed offline and 6× faster for online co-abundance estimation. Leveraging the MinHash technique to quickly compare metagenomic samples. GATTACA also provides an efficient way to identify publicly-available metagenomic data that can be incorporated into the set of reference metagenomes to further improve binning accuracy. Thus. enabling easy indexing and reuse of publicly-available metagenomic datasets.

However. the positional distributions of coding mutations. and the 79% of somatic variants in exome data that do not alter protein sequence or RNA splicing. remain largely unstudied. We employed density-based clustering methods on ∼4.700 exomes from 21 tumor types to detect variably-sized significantly mutated regions (SMRs). SMRs reveal recurrent alterations across a diverse spectrum of coding and non-coding elements. including microRNAs. transcription factor binding sites. and untranslated regions that are individually mutated in up to ∼15% of samples in specific cancer types. SMRs often associated with changes in gene expression and signalling. Mapping SMRs to protein structures revealed spatial clustering of somatic mutations at known and novel cancer-driver domains and molecular interfaces. Mutation frequencies in SMRs demonstrate that distinct protein regions are differentially mutated among tumor types.

By using binding data of more than 100 TFs and related factors in about 500 ChIP-seq experiments produced by the ENCODE project consortium from multiple cell types. together with matched data for gene expression and chromatin states. we constructed statistical models that capture general properties of three paired types of genomic regions in five cell lines. which we provide as a reference resource.

Once again. the authors demonstrated that this biosensor was specific to estrogen and capable of discriminating among the many estrogen analogs tested. Moreover. DHFR–ERα fusions that contain point mutations in the ligand-binding domain fail to grow in the presence of estrogen. Therefore. this system can also be used to determine key residues that are required for ligand binding.One advantage of this approach is that it works as a chemical switch between growth and no growth. thereby allowing direct selections. In this system. the lack of intermediary signal transduction steps decreases the possibility of acquiring yeast mutations that may lead to false positives.

Inc.,The morphology of fully and partially polymerized poly(phthalocyaninatogermoxane). [Ge(Pc)O]n. crystals was studied by both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the morphological units are lath‐like crystals which aggregate into particles. Generally speaking. the thickness. width. and length of the laths are in the range of 1000–2000 Å. 2000–10.000 Å. and 1–5 μm. respectively. Each lath may possess a mosaic substructure. Selected‐area electron diffraction patterns indicate that the rigid. extended [Ge(Pc)O]n chains are parallel to the large surface of the lath. and in most crystals the chains lie parallel to the lengthwise direction of the lath. However. in several cases. the chain orientation is at an angle of about 60° with respect to the long edge of the lath.

To comprehensively understand the healthy B cell immune repertoire and how this changes over time and through natural infection. we conducted immune repertoire RNA sequencing on flow cytometry-sorted B cell subsets to profile a single individual9s antibodies over 11 months through two periods of natural viral infection. We found that 1) a baseline of healthy variable (V) gene usage in antibodies exists and is stable over time. but antibodies in memory cells consistently have a different usage profile relative to earlier B cell stages; 2) a single complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) is potentially generated from more than one VJ gene combination; and 3) IgG and IgA antibody transcripts are found at low levels in early human B cell development. suggesting that class switching may occur earlier than previously realized.

31043,AdaReg: Data Adaptive Robust Estimation in Linear Regression with Application in GTEx Gene Expressions,2019.0,Meng Wang and Lihua Jiang and Michael P Snyder,,bioRxiv,,869362,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,With the development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. the Genotype Tissue-Expression (GTEx) project (Consortium et al.. 2015) generated a valuable resource of gene expression data from more than 11.000 samples. The large-scale data set is a powerful resource for understanding the human transcriptome. However. the technical variation. sequencing background noise and unknown factors make the statistical analysis challenging. To eliminate the possibility that outliers might affect the estimation of population distribution. we need a more robust estimation method. a method that will adapt to heterogeneous genes and further optimize the estimate for each gene. We followed the approach of the robust estimation based on gamma-density-power-weight (Fujisawa and Eguchi. 2008; Windham. 1995). where gamma is the exponent of density weight which controls the balance between bias and variance. As far as we know. our work is the first to propose a procedure to tune the parameter gamma to balance the bias-variance trade-off under the mixture distributions. We constructed a robust likelihood criterion based on weighted densities in the mixture model of Gaussian population distribution mixed with unknown outlier distribution. and developed a data-adaptive gamma-selection procedure embedded into the robust estimation. We provided a heuristic analysis on the selection criterion and found that our practical selection trend under various gammas in average performance has similar capability to capture minimizer gamma as the inestimable Mean Squared Error (MSE) trend from our simulation studies under a …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:gYnLYBw1zZMC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/869362v1.abstract,1568363547927114740,/scholar?cites=1568363547927114740,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/12/10/869362.full.pdf,0,0,0
31044,AdaTiSS: A Novel Data-Adaptive Robust Method for Quantifying Tissue Specificity Scores,2019.0,Meng Wang and Lihua Jiang and Michael P Snyder,,bioRxiv,,869404,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Motivation: Accurately detecting tissue specificity (TS) in genes helps researchers understand tissue functions at the molecular level. and further identify disease mechanisms and discover tissue-specific therapeutic targets. The Genotype- Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (Consortium. 2015). and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project (Uhlén. et al.. 2015) are two publicly available data resources. providing large-scale gene expressions across multiple tissue types. Multiple tissue comparisons. technical background noise and unknown variation factors make it challenging to accurately identify tissue specific gene expressions. Several methods worked on measuring the overall TS in gene expressions and classifying genes into tissue-enrichment categories. There still lacks a robust method to provide quantitative TS scores for each tissue. Methods: We recognized that the key to quantify tissue specific gene expressions is to properly define a concept of expression population. We considered that inside the population. the sample expressions from various tissues are more or less balanced. and the outlier expressions outside the population may indicate tissue specificity. We then formulated the question to robustly estimate the population distribution. In a linear regression problem. we developed a novel data-adaptive robust estimation based on density-power-weight under unknown outlier distribution and non-vanishing outlier proportion (Wang. et al.. 2019). In the question of quantifying TS. we focused on the Gaussian-population mixture model.

Under heterogenous samples such as in the Phase I study of the Enhancing Genotype-Tissue Expression (eGTEx) project (Jiang. et al.. 2019). the samples coming from 32 different tissues. and without prior housekeeping protein information or spike-ins. how to robustly correct the bias but keep tissue internal variations becomes a challenging question. Majority of previous normalization methods cannot guarantee a robust and tissue adaptive correction. This motivates us to develop a data-driven robust normalization method in MS platform to adapt tissue sample heterogeneities. To robustly estimate the sample effect. we take use of the density power weight to down weigh the outliers and extend the one-dimensional robust fitting in (Windham. 1995) and (Fujisawa and Eguchi. 2008) to our structured data. We construct our robust criterion and build the algorithm to get our robust normalization (RobNorm). We focus our comparison to the PQN a widely used normalization method in MS. In the simulation studies and real data application. we conclude that our robust normalization method to estimate the sample effect performs better than PQN especially when the regulation magnitude and proportion are large and strong. We also discuss some limitations in our method.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:qOpkhvVCMvUC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/770115v1.abstract,4517128862739999916,/scholar?cites=4517128862739999916,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/09/19/770115.full.pdf,0,0,0

They are usually silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. but a few are known to escape silencing at embryonic stages. affecting early human development by regulating nearby protein-coding genes. To investigate transcriptional activity in human adult tissues we systematically investigate the expression landscape of about 4.2 million non-coding TEs in 8.051 RNA-Seq datasets from up to 49 adult tissues and 540 individuals. We show that approximately 79.558 individual TEs (2%). belonging to 856 subfamilies escape epigenetic silencing in adult tissues and become transcriptionally active. often in a very tissue-specific manner. Supporting a role for TEs in the regulation of expression of nearby genes. we found the expression of TEs often correlated with the expression of nearby genes. and significantly stronger when the TEs include eQTLs for the genes. We identified thousands of tissue-elevated. sex-associated TEs in the breast. ethnicity-associated in the skin and age-associated in the tibial artery. where we found a potential implication of two TE subfamilies in atherosclerosis.

Fibroblasts are present in all tissues and contribute to wound healing4-6. They are also the cell type that is mostly used for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming7 – a process that has implications for regenerative medicine and rejuvenation strategies8-17. Here we show that primary fibroblasts from old mice secrete inflammatory cytokines and that there is an increased variability in reprogramming efficiency between fibroblast cultures from old individuals. Individual-to-individual variability is emerging as a key feature of old age18-21. which could reflect distinct aging trajectories. but the underlying causes remain unknown. To identify drivers of this variability. we perform a multi-omic assessment of young and old fibroblast cultures with different reprogramming efficiency. This approach. coupled with single cell transcriptomics. reveals that old fibroblast cultures are heterogeneous and show a greater proportion of ‘activated fibroblasts’ that secrete inflammatory cytokines. which correlates with reprogramming efficiency. We experimentally validate that activated fibroblasts express inflammatory cytokines in vivo and that their presence is linked to enhanced reprogramming efficiency in culture. Conditioned-media swapping experiments show that extrinsic factors secreted by activated fibroblasts are more critical than intrinsic factors for the individual-to-individual variability in reprogramming efficiency. and we identify TNFα as a key inflammatory cytokine underlying this variability …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:-qpA3cGbmHsC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/448431v1.abstract,7853460720594801275,/scholar?cites=7853460720594801275,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/10/19/448431.full.pdf,0,0,0

Reversible protein phosphorylation. through the action of protein kinases and phosphatases. has been implicated to play a role in nearly every basic cellular process. ranging from DNA replication. gene transcription. and protein translation to cell differentiation. cell growth. and intercellular communication. Phosphorylation can not only directly activate or deactivate a protein target. but also affect the rate at which a protein is degraded. its ability to translocate from one subcellular compartment to another. and its capacity to bind to other proteins.

However. genomewide studies have shown that transcriptional pausing during elongation is a frequent phenomenon in tightly-regulated metazoan genes. Using a combination of ChIP-on-chip and genomic run-on approaches. we found that the proportion of transcriptionally active RNA polymerase II (active versus total) present throughout the yeast genome is characteristic of some functional gene classes. like those related to ribosomes and mitochondria. This proportion also responds to regulatory stimuli mediated by protein kinase A and. in relation to cytosolic ribosomal-protein genes. it is mediated by the silencing domain of Rap1. We found that this inactive form of RNA polymerase II. which accumulates along the full length of ribosomal protein genes. is phosphorylated in the Ser5 residue of the CTD. but is hypophosphorylated in Ser2. Using the same experimental approach. we show that the in vivo–depletion of FACT. a chromatin-related elongation factor. also produces a regulon-specific effect on the expression of the yeast genome. This work demonstrates that the regulation of transcription elongation is a widespread. gene class–dependent phenomenon that also affects housekeeping genes.Citation: Pelechano V. Jimeno-González S.

Instead. libraries of anti bodies and proteins. including murine. human. humanized. single chain. and synthetic antibodies. are screened using high throughput assays to identify those antibodies and pro teins which cause cell death. Standard technology is then used to screen for cell viability. Antibodies and proteins which induce apoptosis preferentially or exclusively of cancer cells are then isolated. characterized. and may be cloned. A method for cloning antibodies and proteins has been developed. which provides means for rapid identification of the antibody or protein and the gene encoding the antibody or protein. based on the presence of a “barcode'or “unique sequence.” A method for high …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC,1,https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080145364A1/en,1624730021204012825,/scholar?cites=1624730021204012825,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/8b/37/db/74afff77fca804/US20080145364A1.pdf,0,0,0

The ζ gene is expressed in the embryonic stage. while α-1 and α-2 genes are expressed throughout the adult life. Although the alpha like globin genes are flanked by genes that are transcribed in many cell types. their expression is restricted to the erythroid cells. Since the alpha globin genes are situated amidst the actively transcribing genes. they are supposed to be in the open chromatin configuration. even when they are transcriptionally silent in non-erythroid cells. Hence. understanding the structure of the chromatin of the alpha globin locus in erythroid and non-erythroid cells is needed to delineate the cell type and developmental stage specific regulation of expression of these genes. In the present study. we have undertaken a comparative analysis of the chromatin structure of the alpha globin locus. recruitment of transcription factors. and the …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC,1,https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/110/11/1774/56710,1070363467387698457,/scholar?cites=1070363467387698457,,,0,0,0
31074,19 Kinase Substrate Identification Using Yeast Protein Microarrays,2007.0,Geeta Devgan and Michael Snyder,,Functional Protein Microarrays in Drug Discovery,,351,CRC Press,Protein phosphorylation is one of the most abundant posttranslational modifications affecting cellular function in both lower and higher life forms. 1 Reversible protein phosphorylation is an essential mechanism for regulating basic functions such as DNA replication. cell cycle control. gene transcription. protein translation. and energy metabolism. Such control is achieved by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. All protein kinases catalyze the transfer of the γ-phosphate group of ATP to the hydroxyl groups of serine. threonine. or tyrosine residues in protein substrates. with the exception of histidine kinases (which phosphorylate histidine residues). The significance of protein phosphorylation in eukaryotic signaling pathways is illustrated by the fact that protein kinase domains are found in about 2% of eukaryotic proteins including those of yeast. flies and humans. 2 Moreover. approximately 30% of cellular proteins contain covalently bound phosphate. and abnormal levels of protein phosphorylation are a cause or consequence of major diseases such as cancer. diabetes. and rheumatoid arthritis. 1 For example. the first discovered proto-oncogene v-Src encodes an aberrantly regulated tyrosine kinase. 3 Phosphorylation not only activates or deactivates a protein target. but can also alter the rate at which a protein is degraded. its ability to translocate from one subcellular compartment to another. and its capacity to bind with other proteins.

For this. we propose a mining approach combining noisy data from ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-chip experiments with known binding site patterns. Our method (BoCaTFBS) uses boosted cascades of classifiers for optimum efficiency. in which components are alternating decision trees; it exploits interpositional correlations; and it explicitly integrates massive negative information from ChIP-chip experiments.

Though still expensive. every year it is cheaper to perform multi-omic studies. often exponentially so. In addition to its increasing accessibility. multi-omics reveals a view of systems biology to an unprecedented depth. Thus. multi-omics can be used to answer a broad range of biological questions in finer resolution than previous methods. We used six omic measurements—four nucleic acid (ie. genomic. epigenomic. transcriptomics. and metagenomic) and two mass spectrometry (proteomics and metabolomics) based—to highlight an analysis workflow on this type of data. which is often vast. This workflow is not exhaustive of all the omic measurements or analysis methods. but it will provide an experienced or even a novice multi-omic researcher with the tools necessary to analyze their data. This review begins with analyzing a single ome and study design. and then synthesizes best practices in data integration techniques that include machine learning.

Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) serves to resolve stalled translation. during which untemplated Ala/Thr residues are added C terminally to stalled peptide. as shown during C-terminal Ala and Thr addition (CAT-tailing) in yeast. The mechanism and biological effects of CAT-tailing–like activity in metazoans remain unclear. Here we show that CAT–tailing-like modification of poly(GR). a dipeptide repeat derived from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD)-associated GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion in C9ORF72. contributes to disease. We find that poly(GR) can act as a mitochondria-targeting signal. causing some poly(GR) to be cotranslationally imported into mitochondria.

In the present study. we performed whole exome sequencing of a large ET-affected family (10 affected and 6 un-affected family members) and identified a TUB p.V431I variant (rs75594955) segregating in a manner consistent with autosomal-dominant inheritance. Subsequent targeted re-sequencing of TUB in 820 unrelated individuals with sporadic ET and 630 controls revealed significant enrichment of rare nonsynonymous TUB variants (e.g. rs75594955: p.V431I. rs1241709665: p.Ile20Phe. rs55648406: p.Arg49Gln) in the ET cohort (SKAT-O test p-value = 6.20e-08).

ALS is determined by gene-environment interactions and improved understanding of these interactions may lead to effective personalised medicine. The role of physical exercise in the development of ALS is currently controversial.  Methods: We dissected the exercise-ALS relationship in a series of two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) experiments. We then we tested for enrichment of ALS genetic risk within exercise-associated transcriptome changes. Finally. we applied a validated physical activity (PA) questionnaire in a small cohort of genetically selected ALS patients.   Findings: We present MR evidence supporting a causal relationship between genetic liability to strenuous leisure-time exercise and ALS (multiplicative random effects IVW. p=0.01). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that genes with altered expression in response to acute exercise are enriched with known ALS risk genes (permutation test. p=0.013) including C9ORF72. and with ALS-associated rare variants of uncertain significance. Questionnaire evidence revealed that age of onset is inversely proportional to historical PA for C9ORF72-ALS (linear regression. t=-2.28. p=0.036) but not for non-C9ORF72-ALS. Moreover. compared to non-C9ORF72-ALS patients and neurologically normal controls. C9ORF72-ALS cases reported the highest minimum average PA (20.9kJ/kg/day) consistent with an exercise threshold for penetrance.

Fewer. if any. studies of these devices have been conducted in healthy adolescents and teenagers. especially over a long period of time.  The goal of this work was to document the successes and challenges involved in 5 years of a wearable fitness device use in a pediatric case study.   Materials and Methods: Comparison of five years of step counts and minutes asleep from a teenaged girl and her father.   Results: At 60 months. this may be the longest reported pediatric study involving a wearable fitness device. and the first simultaneously involving a parent and a child.  We find step counts to be significantly higher for both the adult and teen on school/work days. along with less sleep. The teen walked significantly less towards the end of the 5 year study.  Surprisingly. many of the adult9s and teen9s sleeping and step counts were correlated. possibly due to coordinated behaviors.   Discussion: We end with several recommendations for pediatricians and device manufacturers. including the need for constant adjustments of stride length and calorie counts as teens are growing.   Conclusion: With periodic adjustments for growth. this pilot study shows these devices can be used for more accurate and consistent measurements in adolescents and teenagers over longer periods of time. to potentially promote healthy behaviors.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:2MdNiwGT7yoC,0,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.21.20215491v1.full-text,,,,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.21.20215491v1.full-text,0,0,0

Previously published methods for normalization primarily depend on the assumption that the distribution of protein expression is similar across all samples. However. this assumption fails when the protein expression data is generated from heterogenous samples. such as from various tissue types. This led us to develop a novel data-driven method for improved normalization to correct the systematic bias meanwhile maintaining underlying biological heterogeneity. Results: To robustly correct the systematic bias. we used the density-power-weight method to down-weigh outliers and extended the one-dimensional robust fitting method described in the previous work to our structured data. We then constructed a robustness criterion and developed a new normalization algorithm. called RobNorm. In simulation studies and analysis of real data from the genotype-tissue expression project. we compared and evaluated the performance of RobNorm against other normalization methods. We found that the RobNorm approach exhibits the greatest reduction in systematic bias while maintaining across-tissue variation. especially for datasets from highly heterogeneous samples.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:wuYnf3tzzDUC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/770115v2.full-text,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/770115v2.full-text,0,0,0

A quantitative understanding of how motif lexicons influence dynamic regulatory activity has been elusive due to the combinatorial nature of the cis-regulatory code. To address this. we undertook multi-omic data profiling of chromatin and expression dynamics across epidermal differentiation to identify 40.103 dynamic CREs associated with 3.609 dynamically expressed genes. then applied an interpretable deep learning framework to model the cis-regulatory logic of chromatin accessibility. This identified cooperative DNA sequence rules in dynamic CREs regulating synchronous gene modules with diverse roles in skin differentiation. Massively parallel reporter analysis validated temporal dynamics and cooperative cis-regulatory logic.

In this study. we used human stem cells as an in-vitro system to interrogate the mechanisms underlying drug-induced toxicity during cardiomyocyte differentiation. including anticancer tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs (imatinib. sunitinib. and vandetanib). H1-ESCs were treated with these drugs at sublethal levels during cardiomyocyte differentiation. We found that early exposure to TKIs during differentiation induced obvious toxic effects in differentiated cardiomyocytes. including disarranged sarcomere structure. interrupted Ca2+-handling. and impaired mitochondrial function. As sunitinib exposure showed the most significant developmental cardiotoxicity of all TKIs. we further examine its effect with in-vivo experiments. Maternal sunitinib exposure caused fetal death. bioaccumulation. and histopathologic changes in the neonatal mice. Integrative analysis of both transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility landscapes revealed that TKI-exposure altered GATA4-mediated regulatory network. which included key mitochondrial genes. Overexpression of GATA4 with CRISPR-activation restored morphologies. contraction. and mitochondria function in cardiomyocytes upon TKI exposure early during differentiation.

31127,Template-switching artifacts resemble alternative polyadenylation,2019.0,Z Boldogkői and Z Balázs and D Tombácz and Z Csabai and N Moldován and M Snyder,,,,,,Background: Alternative polyadenylation is commonly examined using cDNA sequencing. which is known to be affected by template-switching artifacts. However. the effects of such template-switching artifacts on alternative polyadenylation are generally disregarded. while alternative polyadenylation artifacts are attributed to internal priming. Results: Here. we analyzed both long-read cDNA sequencing and direct RNA sequencing data of two organisms. generated by different sequencing platforms. We developed a filtering algorithm which takes into consideration that template-switching can be a source of artifactual polyadenylation when filtering out spurious polyadenylation sites. The algorithm outperformed the conventional internal priming filters based on comparison to direct RNA sequencing data. We also showed that the polyadenylation artifacts arise in cDNA sequencing at consecutive stretches of as few as three adenines. There was no substantial difference between the lengths of poly (A) tails at the artifactual and the true transcriptional end sites even though it is expected that internal priming artifacts have shorter poly (A) tails than genuine polyadenylated reads. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that template switching plays an important role in the generation of spurious polyadenylation and support the need for more rigorous filtering of artifactual polyadenylation sites in cDNA data. or that alternative polyadenylation should be annotated using native RNA sequencing.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:WsFh9Szeq2wC,0,https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr135695,,,,,0,0,0

31135,Is this really the end? Template-switching artifacts resemble alternative polyadenylation,2019.0,Z Boldogkői and Z Balázs and D Tombácz and Z Csabai and N Moldován and M Snyder,,,,,,Background: Alternative polyadenylation is commonly examined using cDNA sequencing. which is known to be affected by template-switching artifacts. However. the effects of such template-switching artifacts on alternative polyadenylation are generally disregarded. while alternative polyadenylation artifacts are attributed to internal priming. Results: Here. we analyzed both long-read cDNA sequencing and direct RNA sequencing data of two organisms. generated by different sequencing platforms. We developed a filtering algorithm which takes into consideration that template-switching can be a source of artifactual polyadenylation when filtering out spurious polyadenylation sites. The algorithm outperformed the conventional internal priming filters based on comparison to direct RNA sequencing data. We also showed that the polyadenylation artifacts arise in cDNA sequencing at consecutive stretches of as few as three adenines. There was no substantial difference between the lengths of poly (A) tails at the artifactual and the true transcriptional end sites even though it is expected that internal priming artifacts have shorter poly (A) tails than genuine polyadenylated reads. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that template switching plays an important role in the generation of spurious polyadenylation and support the need for more rigorous filtering of artifactual polyadenylation sites in cDNA data. or that alternative polyadenylation should be annotated using native RNA sequencing.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:QlnOKEPDpKwC,0,https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr147514,,,,,0,0,0

Here. we conducted a genome-scale screen for essential CTCF loop anchors in the K562 leukemia cell line. Surprisingly. the primary drivers of signal in this screen were single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with low specificity scores. After removing these guides. we found that there were no CTCF loop anchors critical for cell growth. We also observed this effect in an independent screen fine-mapping the core motifs in enhancers of the GATA1 gene. We then conducted screens in parallel with CRISPRi and CRISPRa. which do not induce DNA damage. and found that an unexpected and distinct set of off-targets also caused strong confounding growth effects with these epigenome-editing platforms. Promisingly. strict filtering of CRISPRi libraries using GuideScan specificity scores removed these confounded sgRNAs and allowed for the identification of essential enhancers. which we validated extensively. Together. our results show off-target activity can severely limit identification of essential functional motifs by active Cas9. while strictly filtered CRISPRi screens can be reliably used for assaying larger regulatory elements.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:hXZnTIgIr50C,0,https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr67809,,,,,0,0,0

How these heavy isotopes are enriched or depleted over a long term is unclear. but artificial manipulation of heavy isotope content in various organisms has produced significant impacts on biological functions. suggesting the origin may arise with intrinsic mechanisms for a functional outcome. Our previous study has revealed an age-associated decline in metabolite heavy isotope content (HIC) in the budding yeast. which could be reversed in part by supplementing heavy water. and consequently. also increased yeast lifespans. In the current study. we report a similar age-dependent decline in HIC from three types of mouse tissues: brain. heart. and skeletal muscles. Furthermore. individual tissues exhibited different patterns of HIC change over age. which appeared to match their development and maturation timelines. These results have demonstrated that age-dependent decline in HIC also exists in mammals. which is likely a traceable feature of development and perhaps aging.

By studying chromatin modifiers regulated by epithelial growth factor. we identify histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) as an induced gene that enhances cell proliferation by coordinating histone production with glucose metabolism. In addition to its canonical role as a cytoplasmic free histone H4 acetyltransferase. a HAT1-containing complex binds specifically at promoters of H4 genes. HAT1 stimulated acetate delivery and consumption at H4 promoters to drive S-phase H4 transcription. This required the presence of a histone H4-specific promoter element in the region of HAT1 chromatin binding. These data describe a feed-forward circuit whereby HAT1-dependent capture of acetyl-groups drives further H4 production to support growth-factor dependent proliferation. These findings also extend to human disease and animal models. as high HAT1 levels associate with poor outcomes across multiple cancer types.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:q7LczdTNAjsC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/664615v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/06/10/664615.full.pdf,0,0,0

In this regard. currently two LRS platforms have demonstrated adequate performance: the Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and the nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Even though these techniques produce lower coverage and are more error prone than short-read sequencing. they continue to be more successful in identifying transcript isoforms including polycistronic and multi-spliced RNA molecules. as well as transcript overlaps. Recent reports have successfully applied LRS for the investigation of the transcriptome of viruses belonging to various families. These studies have substantially increased the number of previously known viral RNA molecules. In this work. we used the Sequel and MinION technique from PacBio and ONT. respectively. to characterize the lytic transcriptome of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In most samples. we analyzed the poly(A) fraction of the transcriptome. but we also performed random oligonucleotide-based sequencing. Besides cDNA sequencing. we also carried out native RNA sequencing. Our investigations identified more than 160 previously undetected transcripts. including coding and non-coding RNAs. multi-splice transcripts. as well as polycistronic and complex transcripts. Furthermore. we determined previously unsubstantiated transcriptional start sites. polyadenylation sites. and splice sites. A large number of novel transcriptional overlaps were also detected.

Here. we conducted a genome-scale screen for essential CTCF loop anchors in the K562 leukemia cell line. Surprisingly. the primary drivers of signal in this screen were single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with low specificity scores. After removing these guides. we found that there were no CTCF loop anchors critical for cell growth. We also observed this effect in an independent screen fine-mapping the core motifs in enhancers of the GATA1 gene. We then conducted screens in parallel with CRISPRi and CRISPRa. which do not induce DNA damage. and found that an unexpected and distinct set of off-targets also caused strong confounding growth effects with these epigenome-editing platforms. Promisingly. strict filtering of CRISPRi libraries using GuideScan specificity scores removed these confounded sgRNAs and allowed for the identification of essential enhancers. which we validated extensively. Together. our results show off-target activity can severely limit identification of essential functional motifs by active Cas9. while strictly filtered CRISPRi screens can be reliably used for assaying larger regulatory elements.,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:_TjUWtciUekC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/520569v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/01/18/520569.full.pdf,0,0,0

VISTA/PD-1H is a checkpoint receptor expressed on immune cells that is an effective anti-cancer target in mouse models and now in early human clinical trials. We utilized an in vitro system to examine epigenetic changes arising early after depletion of breast cancer tumor suppressor proteins. This demonstrates that epigenetic alterations occur in normal human mammary cell lines lacking BRCA2 and result in regulation of VISTA through an NF-kB-dependent pathway. VISTA is strongly induced by growth factor limitation. an effect that is blunted by BRCA2-induced NF-kB activation and binding to a kB site in the VISTA promoter. This suggests that repression of VISTA may be an early consequence of BRCA2 depletion in pre-neoplastic tissues leading to immune infiltration.

Significant barriers to studying cancer-initiating events include intrinsic cellular pathways to prevent cell proliferation in the setting of activating oncogenes or genomic instability. To circumvent this limitation. we studied in vitro transient depletion of breast cancer tumor suppressor genes followed by selective growth conditions to enrich for de novo mutations or stable epigenetic alterations that can confer a growth advantage to non-transformed breast epithelial cells. We report that transient BRCA2 depletion. but not depletion of other breast cancer genes. leads to a selective growth advantage in EGF-free media. This is due to a failure of BRCA2 inactivated cells to enact a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition upon withdrawal of EGF.

The main limitation hindering their study is sequencing technology. The short read lengths of modern instruments–combined with various inherent difficulties associated with complex bacterial environments–make it very difficult to perform simple tasks such as accurately identifying bacterial strains. recovering their genomic sequences. and assessing their abundance. Many approaches have been proposed to address these shortcomings. Specialized library preparation techniques such as Hi-C or synthetic long reads are often very accurate. but also prohibitively complex. As a result. approaches based on contig binning are more popular in practice.Metagenomic binning refers to the problem of grouping together partially assembled sequence fragments (or contigs) that belong to the same species.

31207,Expanding the accuracy. resolution. and breadth of cell-free DNA investigation,2016.0,Matthew William Snyder,,,,,,When cells die. they don’t simply vanish without a trace. Instead. they leave behind fingerprints of their genetic and epigenetic identities in the form of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). or the scant amount of highly fragmented DNA circulating in human plasma. As the detritus of apoptotic and necrotic cell death in multiple tissues throughout the body. this class of molecule serves as a powerful biomarker for noninvasive detection and monitoring of disease processes and physiological conditions. including pregnancy. organ transplantation. and a growing number of cancers. Despite this promise. current methods for interrogating cfDNA are challenged by limited resolution. imperfect accuracy. and constrained breadth. Taken as a whole. these factors restrict the set of conditions that might in principle be detected or monitored with this molecular evidence. In this dissertation. I directly address these limitations with the goal of expanding the scope and precision of the ``liquid biopsy.'' or the noninvasive monitoring of health status through cfDNA analysis. I first address the limited resolution of cfDNA testing in the context of pregnancy by developing statistical methods for inference of the entire fetal genome at the single nucleotide level. including both inherited and de novo variation. I show that the use of parental haplotypes and maternal cfDNA in a hidden Markov model can yield highly accurate prediction of inherited fetal genotypes. I next determine that the length of parental haplotype blocks is a key parameter driving the prediction accuracy. and demonstrate a method for increasing block length and downstream inference. I explain how these approaches …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:wkm4DBaukwsC,0,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/35592,,,,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/35592/Snyder_washington_0250E_15566.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Several recent studies have found that neural population activity across a region can be explained in large part by a shared. lowdimensional signal [1-5]. Population-wide correlation is likely to influence the local field potential (LFP)-an epiphenomenon that reflects low-frequency. concerted neural activity from anatomically connected circuits. Here. we show that LFP and spike trains recorded simultaneously from the middle temporal (MT) area of the awake macaque indeed share population-wide correlation. We apply canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to 16 channels of LFP and 16 spike sorted neurons (from 12 channels) acquired at 50 ms temporal resolution during inter-trial intervals (when the monkey was free to make eye movements). as well as during performance of a perceptual decision-making task (when the monkey maintained fixation and discriminated the direction of visual motion). CCA finds instantaneous linear projections of the LFP that maximize the correlation to corresponding projections of the population spike trains. Previous studies have suggested using population spike rate as a proxy for the local network state [3. 5]. Applied to our dataset. we obtain a correlation coefficient of-12% between population spike rate and the mean LFP during inter-trial interval segments. In contrast. we obtain pairs of canonical variables with corresponding canonical correlations 29%. 26%. and 21%. We then applied the extracted projections to the task-relevant motion stimulus integration window.

However. most existing approaches are aimed at identifying protein-disrupting mutations alone and hence ignore ~45% of exome variant calls that fall outside of coding regions. Despite clear examples of import of non-coding mutations to specific diseases (such as recurrent mutations in the TERT promoter in melanoma). analyses of non-coding oncogenic alterations have been limited to a small subset of tumor types or have been performed across cancer-types (pan-cancer). Moreover. these analyses have employed either annotation-guided or fixed size sliding-window approaches that presume the relevant scale of functional elements altered in cancer. Here. we employed spatial clustering methods for multi-scale. unbiased …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:MDX3w3dAD3YC,0,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/75/22_Supplement_2/B2-42.short,,,,,0,0,0

In 2010 alone. over 375.000 people died of coronary heart disease. of which over 120.000 were from myocardial infarction. Due to technical challenges associated with current techniques. profiling epigenome changes due to myocardial infarction has been limited. We have optimized an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) protocol that circumvents these challenges and works well with frozen tissue.Hypothesis: We assessed the hypothesis that ATAC-seq would enable the identification of novel chromatin remodeling and transcription factor binding events in a murine model of cardiac ischemia.Methods: Six 10 ± 2 week old C57BL/6J mice were paired by same gender. age. and litter. and mice from these pairs were selected for either mid left anterior descending artery ligation or sham …,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:DQNrXyjhriIC,0,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.132.suppl_3.19076,,,,,0,0,0

31213,Let us know how access to this document benefits you.,2015.0,C Cenik and HN Chua and G Singh and A Akef and MP Snyder and AF Palazzo and MJ Moore and FP Roth,,,,,,Drosophila Dicer-2 generates small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). whereas Dicer-1 produces microRNAs from premicroRNA. My thesis focuses on the functional characteristics of two Drosophila Dicers that makes them specific for their biological substrates. We found that RNA binding protein partners of Dicers and two small molecules. ATP and phosphate are key in regulating Drosophila Dicers’ specificity. Without any additional factor. recombinant Dicer-2 cleaves pre-miRNA. but its product is shorter than the authentic miRNA. However. the protein R2D2 and inorganic phosphate block pre-miRNA processing by Dicer-2. In contrast. Dicer-1 is inherently capable of processing the substrates of Dicer. long dsRNAs. Yet. partner protein of Dicer-1. Loqs-PB and ATP increase the efficiency of miRNA production from pre-miRNAs by Dicer-1. therefore enhance substrate specificity of Dicer-1. Our data highlight the role of ATP and regulatory dsRNA-binding partner proteins to achieve substrate specificity in Drosophila RNA silencing. Our study also sheds light onto the function of the helicase domain in Drosophila Dicers. Although Dicer-1 doesn’t hydrolyze ATP. ATP enhances miRNA production by increasing Dicer-1’s substrate specificity through lowering its KM. On the other hand. Dicer-2 is a dsRNA-stimulated ATPase that hydrolyzes ATP to ADP. and ATP hydrolysis is required for Dicer-2 to process long dsRNA. Wild-type Dicer-2. but not a mutant defective in ATP hydrolysis. is processive; generating siRNAs faster than it can dissociate from a long dsRNA,True,YZYne64AAAAJ:ey9_mCyZ-VYC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/56528259.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/56528259.pdf,0,0,0

Effective treatment options for CTCL are limited. and the genetic basis of these T cell lymphomas remains incompletely characterized. Here we report recurrent point mutations and genomic gains of TNFRSF1B. encoding the tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFR2. in 18% of patients with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. Expression of the recurrent TNFR2 Thr377Ile mutant in T cells leads to enhanced non-canonical NF-κB signaling that is sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.

Immortalized porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) cells were infected with PRV. Cells were harvested after 1. 2. 4. 6. 8 and 12 hours after infection. Total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNAs followed by PacBio SMRTBell Library preparation and sequencing.Results: Transcriptional read-through was found between the convergently oriented genes (gene clusters). The read-through efficiency and its orientation show time dependence. Our data show inverse expression dynamics between the convergent clusters. Previously unknown interactions were found between the nested clusters as well as between the divergently oriented genes. Temporal changes of these gene interactions were also characterized.
