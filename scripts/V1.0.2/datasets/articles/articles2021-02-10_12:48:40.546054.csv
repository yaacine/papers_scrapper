The CODM is superior to the existing methods for modular robot configuration design in the sense that traditional type synthesis and dimensional synthesis now can be treated once. This mathematically implies that (i) variables are defined for both types and dimensions. and (ii) all the variables are defined in one optimization problem formulation.

Inc.,This paper concerns the development of a class of devices that generate end‐effector motion in the range of less than 100 μm and with sub‐nanometer resolution; in particular. a parallel manipulator configuration that generates a planar x‐y‐γ motion is considered. The parallel manipulator is implemented as a compliant mechanism. A problem with parallel manipulators is that the forward kinematics is usually too complex. which can hinder the implementation of advanced control algorithms. The contribution of this paper is that a simple method. called the constant‐Jacobian (CJ) method. is developed based on the pseudo‐rigid body (PRB) approach to compliant mechanisms.

The existing research on the hybrid machine prototypes usually uses two servomotors. of which one “mimic” the CV motor by prescribing a constant velocity trajectory profile. It is obvious that this departs away from the real situation where a CV motor is in place. The CV motor will bring in the velocity fluctuation which can not be attenuated by the CV motor itself due to the lack of a control mechanism in the CV motor. yet be propagated to the servomotor. and further to the end-effector of the machine. The general strategy for controlling the hybrid machine is therefore to model this propagated fluctuation and incorporate it into a controller for the servomotor.

111079,Obesity-associated low-grade inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus: causes and consequences,2013,MM Van Greevenbroek and CG Schalkwijk and CD Stehouwer,71,,4,174-87,,The epidemic of overweight and obesity is a major problem because of the plethora of health and economic issues that it induces. Key among these is the sharply increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. The development of T2D is characterised by two processes: 1) insulin resistance. resulting from impaired insulin signalling and leading to an increased demand for insulin. which must be met by increased insulin production by pancreatic β-cells (compensatory β-cell function); and 2) β-cell dysfunction. with T2D developing when the amount of insulin that is produced is insufficient to meet the demand. Overweight and obesity. especially in case of abdominal fat accumulation. are associated with systemic low-grade inflammation. This low-grade inflammation is characterised by. among other things. higher levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines and fatty acids. These can interfere with normal insulin function and thereby induce insulin resistance. and have also been implicated in β-cell dysfunction. This review focuses on the known and emerging relations between inflammation and T2D. We first discuss current views on the effects of fat distribution on adipose tissue inflammation and adipose tissue dysfunction. Next we focus on the detrimental roles of proinflammatory cytokines and fatty acids on insulin signalling and β-cell function. In the last part of this review we provide some insight into novel players in (the initiation of) inflammation in overweight and obesity. and their effects on T2D and vascular dysfunction.,True,m_hhNdgAAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC,242,http://www.njmonline.nl/cntpdf.php?t=i&id=158#page=10,14631586174328030912,/scholar?cites=14631586174328030912,,http://www.njmonline.nl/cntpdf.php?t=i&id=158#page=10,0,0,0

Inflammation is linked to high metabolic activity. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) and their major precursor methylglyoxal are formed during high metabolic activity and can have detrimental effects on cellular function and may induce cell death. Therefore. we investigated whether plaque AGEs are increased in human carotid rupture-prone plaques and are associated with plaque inflammation and necrotic core formation.The protein-bound major methylglyoxal-derived AGE 5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone (MG-H1) and Nɛ-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) were measured in human carotid endarterectomy specimens (n = 75) with tandem mass spectrometry.

We hypothesize that long-term exposure to elevated blood lipids can prime circulating immune cells through changes in DNA methylation. a process that may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. To interrogate the causal relationship between triglyceride. low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and genome-wide DNA methylation while excluding confounding and pleiotropy. we perform a stepwise Mendelian randomization analysis in whole blood of 3296 individuals. This analysis shows that differential methylation is the consequence of inter-individual variation in blood lipid levels and not vice versa. Specifically. we observe an effect of triglycerides on DNA methylation at three CpGs. of LDL cholesterol at one CpG. and of HDL cholesterol at two CpGs using multivariable Mendelian randomization. Using RNA-seq data available for a large subset of individuals (N = 2044). DNA methylation of these six CpGs is associated with the expression of CPT1A and SREBF1 (for triglycerides). DHCR24 (for LDL cholesterol) and ABCG1 (for HDL cholesterol). which are all key regulators of lipid metabolism.

111138,Endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in the development of diabetes: is there a role for adipose tissue and liver?,2009,Carla JH van der Kallen and Marleen MJ van Greevenbroek and Coen DA Stehouwer and Casper G Schalkwijk,14,,12,1424-1434,Springer US,Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a multifactorial chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycaemia. Several different mechanisms have been implicated in the development of the disease. including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ER stress is increasingly acknowledged as an important mechanism in the development of DM. not only for β-cell loss but also for insulin resistance. Accumulating evidence suggests that ER stress-induced apoptosis may be an important mode of β-cell loss and therefore important in the development of diabetes. Recent data also suggest a role of ER stress-induced apoptosis in liver and adipose tissue in relation to diabetes. but more extensive studies on human adipocyte and hepatocyte (patho)physiology and ER stress are needed to identify the exact interactions between environmental signals.

MG mediates the glycation of proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We have recently demonstrated that MG-induced AGEs are a common feature of breast cancer. Little is known regarding the impact of MG-mediated carbonyl stress on tumor progression. Breast tumors with MG stress presented with high nuclear YAP. a key transcriptional co-activator regulating tumor growth and invasion. Elevated MG levels resulted in sustained YAP nuclear localization/activity that could be reverted using Carnosine. a scavenger for MG. MG treatment affected Hsp90 chaperone activity and decreased its binding to LATS1. a key kinase of the Hippo pathway. Cancer cells with high MG stress showed enhanced growth and metastatic potential in vivo.

Central to this immune system is the production of CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) after transcription of the CRISPR locus.

A 1.8 angstrom crystal structure of Csy4 bound to its cognate RNA reveals that Csy4 makes sequence-specific interactions in the major groove of the crRNA repeat stem-loop.

The RNA methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 are components of a multisubunit m6A writer complex whose enzymatic activity is substantially higher than the activities of METTL3 or METTL14 alone. The molecular mechanism underpinning this synergistic effect is poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic core of the human m6A writer complex comprising METTL3 and METTL14. The structure reveals the heterodimeric architecture of the complex and donor substrate binding by METTL3. Structure-guided mutagenesis indicates that METTL3 is the catalytic subunit of the complex. whereas METTL14 has a degenerate active site and plays non-catalytic roles in maintaining complex integrity and substrate RNA binding.

Inc.,Cas9 and Cas12a are multidomain CRISPR‐associated nucleases that can be programmed with a guide RNA to bind and cleave complementary DNA targets. The guide RNA sequence can be varied. making these effector enzymes versatile tools for genome editing and gene regulation applications. While Cas9 is currently the best‐characterized and most widely used nuclease for such purposes. Cas12a (previously named Cpf1) has recently emerged as an alternative for Cas9. Cas9 and Cas12a have distinct evolutionary origins and exhibit different structural architectures. resulting in distinct molecular mechanisms. Here we compare the structural and mechanistic features that distinguish Cas9 and Cas12a. and describe how these features modulate their activity.

In this system. the endonuclease Cas9 generates double strand breaks in DNA upon RNA-guided recognition of a complementary DNA sequence. which strictly requires the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) next to the target site. Although PAM recognition is essential for cleavage. it is unknown whether and how PAM binding activates Cas9 for DNA cleavage at spatially distant sites. Here. we find evidence of a PAM-induced allosteric mechanism revealed by microsecond molecular dynamics simulations.

Upon target DNA binding. Cas12a cleaves both the target DNA in cis and non-target single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in trans.

We show that guide RNA-target strand DNA hybridization conformationally activates Cas12a. triggering its trans-acting. non-specific. single-stranded DNase activity. In turn. cis cleavage of double-stranded DNA targets is a result of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent DNA duplex unwinding. electrostatic stabilization of the displaced non-target DNA strand. and ordered sequential cleavage of the non-target and target DNA strands.

Ge-1 contains an N-terminal WD40-repeat domain connected by a low-complexity region to a conserved C-terminal domain. It was reported that the C-terminal domain interacts with DCP2 and mediates Ge-1 oligomerization and P-body localization. To understand the molecular basis for these functions. we determined the three-dimensional crystal structure of the most conserved region of the Drosophila melanogaster Ge-1 C-terminal domain. The region adopts an all α-helical fold related to ARM- and HEAT-repeat proteins. Using structure-based mutants we identified an invariant surface residue affecting P-body localization.

This revolutionary tool is promising to treat a myriad of human genetic diseases. Nevertheless. the molecular basis of DNA cleavage. which is a fundamental step for genome editing. has not been established. Here. quantum–classical molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy methods are used to disclose the two-metal-dependent mechanism of phosphodiester bond cleavage in CRISPR-Cas9. Ab initio MD reveals a conformational rearrangement of the Mg2+-bound RuvC active site. which entails the relocation of H983 to act as a general base. Then. the DNA cleavage proceeds through a concerted associative pathway fundamentally assisted by the joint dynamics of the two Mg2+ ions. This clarifies previous controversial experimental evidence. which could not …,True,NGAIUhkAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC,4,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.0c03566,15607805664888455508,/scholar?cites=15607805664888455508,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7842700/,0,0,0

111247,Molecular mechanism of off-target effects in CRISPR-Cas9,2018,Clarisse G Ricci and Janice S Chen and Yinglong Miao and Martin Jinek and Jennifer A Doudna and J Andrew McCammon and Giulia Palermo,,BiorXiv,,421537,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,CRISPR-Cas9 is the state-of-the-art technology for editing and manipulating nucleic acids. However. the occurrence of off-target mutations can limit its applicability. Here. all-atom enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations – using Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD) – are used to decipher the mechanism of off-target binding at the molecular level. GaMD reveals that base pair mismatches in the target DNA at specific distal sites with respect to the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) induce an extended opening of the RNA:DNA heteroduplex. which leads to newly discovered interactions between the unwound nucleic acids and the protein counterpart. The conserved interactions between the target DNA strand and the L2 loop of the catalytic HNH domain constitute a “lock” effectively decreasing the conformational freedom of the HNH domain and its activation for cleavage. Remarkably. depending on their position at PAM distal sites. DNA mismatches leading to off-target cleavages are unable to “lock” the HNH domain. thereby identifying the ability to “lock” HNH as a key determinant. Consistently. off-target sequences hampering the catalysis have been shown to “trap” somehow the HNH domain in an inactive “conformational checkpoint” state (Dagdas et al. Sci Adv. 2017). As such. this mechanism identifies the molecular basis underlying off-target cleavages and contributes in clarifying a long-lasting open issue of the CRISPR-Cas9 function. It also poses the foundation for designing novel and more specific Cas9 variants. which could be obtained by magnifying the “locking” interactions between HNH and the target DNA in the presence of any …,True,NGAIUhkAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,3,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/421537v1.abstract,14315024111228962682,/scholar?cites=14315024111228962682,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/09/19/421537.full.pdf,0,0,0

In yeast. caloric restriction (CR) delays aging by activating the Sir2 deacetylase. Here we show that expression of mammalian Sir2 (SIRT1) is induced in CR rats as well as in human cells that are treated with serum from these animals. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) attenuated this response. SIRT1 deacetylates the DNA repair factor Ku70. causing it to sequester the proapoptotic factor Bax away from mitochondria. thereby inhibiting stress-induced apoptotic cell death. Thus.

The Ku70 DNA end-joining protein has recently been shown to suppress apoptosis by sequestering Bax from mitochondria. The mechanism by which Bax is regulated remains unknown. Here. we identify eight lysines in Ku70 that are targets for acetylation in vivo. Five of these. K539. K542. K544. K533. and K556. lie in the C-terminal linker domain of Ku70 adjacent to the Bax interaction domain. We show that CBP and PCAF efficiently acetylate K542 in vitro and associate with Ku70 in vivo. Mimicking acetylation of K539 or K542 or treating cells with deacetylase inhibitors abolishes the ability of Ku70 to suppress Bax-mediated apoptosis. We demonstrate that increased acetylation of Ku70 disrupts the Ku70-Bax interaction and coincides with cytoplasmic accumulation of CBP.

A subset of CGIs act as polycomb response elements (PREs) and are recognized by the polycomb silencing systems to regulate expression of genes involved in early development. How CGIs function mechanistically as nucleation sites for polycomb repressive complexes remains unknown. Here we discover that KDM2B (FBXL10) specifically recognizes non-methylated DNA in CGIs and recruits the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). This contributes to histone H2A lysine 119 ubiquitylation (H2AK119ub1) and gene repression. Unexpectedly. we also find that CGIs are occupied by low levels of PRC1 throughout the genome. suggesting that the KDM2B-PRC1 complex may sample CGI-associated genes for susceptibility to polycomb-mediated silencing. These observations demonstrate an unexpected and direct link between recognition of CGIs by KDM2B and targeting of the polycomb repressive system.

Loss of FH activity causes accumulation of intracellular fumarate. which can directly modify cysteine residues to form 2-succinocysteine through succination. We undertook a proteomic-based screen in cells and renal cysts from Fh1 (murine FH)-deficient mice and identified 94 protein succination targets. Notably. we identified the succination of three cysteine residues in mitochondrial Aconitase2 (ACO2) crucial for iron-sulfur cluster binding. We show that fumarate exerts a dose-dependent inhibition of ACO2 activity. which correlates with increased succination as determined by mass spectrometry. possibly by interfering with iron chelation. Importantly. we show that aconitase activity is impaired in FH-deficient cells.

We describe the residue-specific methylation of E2F-1 by the asymmetric dimethylating protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) and symmetric dimethylating PRMT5 and relate the marks to different functional consequences of E2F-1 activity. Methylation by PRMT1 hinders methylation by PRMT5. which augments E2F-1-dependent apoptosis. whereas PRMT5-dependent methylation favors proliferation by antagonizing methylation by PRMT1. The ability of E2F-1 to prompt apoptosis in DNA damaged cells coincides with enhanced PRMT1 methylation.

During this time frame. components of the innate immune system such as macrophages and DCs. NK cells. β-defensins. complement and other anti-microbial factors. which have all been implicated in modulating HIV infection. may play particularly important roles. A proteomics-based screen was performed on a cohort from whom samples were available at time points prior to the earliest positive HIV detection. The ability of selected factors found to be elevated in the plasma during AHI to inhibit HIV-1 replication was analyzed using in vitro PBMC and DC infection models. Analysis of unique plasma donor panels spanning the eclipse and viral expansion phases revealed very early alterations in plasma proteins in AHI. Induction of acute phase protein serum amyloid A (A-SAA) occurred as early as 5–7 days prior to the first detection of plasma viral RNA. considerably prior to any elevation in systemic cytokine levels. Furthermore. a proteolytic fragment of alpha–1-antitrypsin (AAT). termed virus inhibitory peptide (VIRIP). was observed in plasma coincident with viremia. Both A-SAA and VIRIP have anti-viral activity in vitro and quantitation of their plasma levels indicated that circulating concentrations are likely to be within the range of their inhibitory activity.

To facilitate this task. recent developments in proteomics include small molecular probes that target proteolytic enzyme families including serine. threonine. and cysteine proteases. For the families of ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (UBL)-specific proteases. such tools were lacking until recently. Here. we review the advances made in the development of protein-based active site-directed probes that target proteases specific for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins.

111358,The SOCS2 ubiquitin ligase complex regulates growth hormone receptor levels,2011,Mattias Vesterlund and Fahad Zadjali and Torbjörn Persson and Michael Lund Nielsen and Benedikt M Kessler and Gunnar Norstedt and Amilcar Flores-Morales,6,PloS one,9,e25358,Public Library of Science,Growth Hormone is essential for the regulation of growth and the homeostatic control of intermediary metabolism. GH actions are mediated by the Growth Hormone Receptor; a member of the cytokine receptor super family that signals chiefly through the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. Target tissue responsiveness to GH is under regulatory control to avoid excessive and off-target effects upon GHR activation. The suppressor of cytokine signalling 2 (SOCS) is a key regulator of GHR sensitivity. This is clearly shown in mice where the SOCS2 gene has been inactivated. which show 30–40% increase in body length. a phenotype that is dependent on endogenous GH secretion. SOCS2 is a GH-stimulated. STAT5b-regulated gene that acts in a negative feedback loop to downregulate GHR signalling. Since the biochemical basis for these actions is poorly understood. we studied the molecular function of SOCS2. We demonstrated that SOCS2 is part of a multimeric complex with intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity. Mutational analysis shows that the interaction with Elongin B/C controls SOCS2 protein turnover and affects its molecular activity. Increased GHR levels were observed in livers from SOCS2−/− mice and in the absence of SOCS2 in in vitro experiments. We showed that SOCS2 regulates cellular GHR levels through direct ubiquitination and in a proteasomally dependent manner. We also confirmed the importance of the SOCS-box for the proper function of SOCS2. Finally. we identified two phosphotyrosine residues in the GHR to be responsible for the interaction with SOCS2. but only Y487 to account for the effects of SOCS2.

In contrast. when an E3 enzyme is introduced. a clear decision between mono- and polyubiquitination is made. and the conjugation type as well as the identity of the target lysine residue on the substrate becomes highly specific. These features of the E3 can be further regulated by auxiliary factors as exemplified by MDMX (Murine Double Minute X).

This response is controlled by a collaboration involving signal-dependent activation of transcription factors. transcriptional co-regulators. and chromatin-modifying factors. We have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that acts as a key regulator of this inflammatory response. Pattern recognition receptors such as the Toll-like receptors induce the expression of numerous lncRNAs. One of these. lincRNA-Cox2. mediates both the activation and repression of distinct classes of immune genes. Transcriptional repression of target genes is dependent on interactions of lincRNA-Cox2 with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B and A2/B1.

This mechanism is akin to the nuclear egress of herpes-type viruses and is essential for proper synapse development. However. the molecular machinery required to remodel the NE during this process is unknown. Here. we identify Torsin. an AAA-ATPase that in humans is linked to dystonia. as a major mediator of primary megaRNP envelopment during NE budding. In torsin mutants. megaRNPs accumulate within the perinuclear space. and the messenger RNAs contained within fail to reach synaptic sites. preventing normal synaptic protein synthesis and thus proper synaptic bouton development.

There are many disease-associated mutations in TDP-43. and several cellular and animal models with ectopic overexpression of mutant TDP-43 have been established. Here we sought to study altered molecular events in FTD and ALS by using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived patient neurons. We generated multiple iPSC lines from an FTD/ALS patient with the TARDBP A90V mutation and from an unaffected family member who lacked the mutation. After extensive characterization. two to three iPSC lines from each subject were selected. differentiated into postmitotic neurons. and screened for relevant cell-autonomous phenotypes. Patient-derived neurons were more sensitive than control neurons to 100 nM straurosporine but not to other inducers of cellular stress. Three disease-relevant cellular phenotypes were revealed under staurosporine-induced stress. First. TDP-43 was localized in the cytoplasm of a higher percentage of patient neurons than control neurons. Second. the total TDP-43 level was lower in patient neurons with the A90V mutation. Third. the levels of microRNA-9 (miR-9) and its precursor pri-miR-9-2 decreased in patient neurons but not in control neurons. The latter is likely because of reduced TDP-43. as shRNA-mediated TDP-43 knockdown in rodent primary neurons also decreased the pri-miR-9-2 level.

111436,Genome analysis reveals interplay between 5′ UTR introns and nuclear mRNA export for secretory and mitochondrial genes,2011,Can Cenik and Hon Nian Chua and Hui Zhang and Stefan P Tarnawsky and Abdalla Akef and Adnan Derti and Murat Tasan and Melissa J Moore and Alexander F Palazzo and Frederick P Roth,7,PLoS genetics,4,e1001366,Public Library of Science,In higher eukaryotes. messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via factors deposited near the 5′ end of the transcript during splicing. The signal sequence coding region (SSCR) can support an alternative mRNA export (ALREX) pathway that does not require splicing. However. most SSCR–containing genes also have introns. so the interplay between these export mechanisms remains unclear. Here we support a model in which the furthest upstream element in a given transcript. be it an intron or an ALREX–promoting SSCR. dictates the mRNA export pathway used. We also experimentally demonstrate that nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes can use the ALREX pathway. Thus. ALREX can also be supported by nucleotide signals within mitochondrial-targeting sequence coding regions (MSCRs). Finally. we identified and experimentally verified novel motifs associated with the ALREX pathway that are shared by both SSCRs and MSCRs. Our results show strong correlation between 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) intron presence/absence and sequence features at the beginning of the coding region. They also suggest that genes encoding secretory and mitochondrial proteins share a common regulatory mechanism at the level of mRNA export.,True,iRaegw8AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC,75,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001366,4980694079997632159,/scholar?cites=4980694079997632159,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001366,0,0,0

111440,Capturing splicing complexes to study structure and mechanism,2002,Melissa S Jurica and Melissa J Moore,28,,3,336-345,Academic Press,At its most basic level. pre-mRNA splicing can be described as two coordinated nuclease reactions that cleave an intron at either end and result in ligation of the flanking exons. The fact that these reactions are catalyzed by a ∼3-MDa behemoth of protein and RNA (the spliceosome) challenges most biochemical and structural approaches currently used to characterize lesser-sized enzymes. In addition to this molecular complexity. the highly dynamic nature of splicing complexes provides additional hurdles for mechanistic studies or three-dimensional structure determination. Thus. the methods used to study the spliceosome often probe individual properties of the machine. but no complete. high-resolution picture of splicing catalysis has yet emerged.

Previous studies have suggested that the earliest steps in spliceosome assembly in yeast are highly ordered and the stable recruitment of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) to the 5′ splice site necessarily precedes recruitment of U2 snRNP to the branch site to form the “prespliceosome.” Here. using colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy to follow initial spliceosome assembly on eight different S. cerevisiae pre-mRNAs. we demonstrate that active yeast spliceosomes can form by both U1-first and U2-first pathways.

Exactly the same pattern of 3′ splice site choice was observed when the same tandem repeats were incorporated into a full-length splicing substrate.

These include the introduction of radioactive labels and photocross-linking reagents for detecting proteins or other RNAs that interact with a particular site of interest. and the introduction of functional group modifications for structure-function probing at single or multiple nucleotide positions.The beginning of this chapter will focus on methods for placing radioactive labels and/or modified nucleotides at single internal sites in long RNAs (Figure 1). This is generally accomplished by first synthesizing the RNA piecemeal (Sections 2 and 3). and then joining the various segments together using any of three ligation techniques (Section 4). To incorporate a single radioactive label. an RNA can be made in two pieces. one of which is 5'endlabelled with [γ-32P] ATP and polynucleotide kinase prior to the ligation reaction (Figure 1A). For site-specific incorporation of modified nucleotides. the RNA is initially made in two or three pieces which are then joined together (Figure 1B and C): a short oligonucleotide containing the desired modification (s) and one or two (depending on where the modification is to be situated) other unmodified RNAs.,True,iRaegw8AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,43,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ObiBuB_s24cC&oi=fnd&pg=PA75&dq=info:TDBXqQWSGCUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=xtP1ZVeo5k&sig=rH-mpqOAUdly2oye9sHxxlaSpEU,2673046931857944652,/scholar?cites=2673046931857944652,,,0,0,0

Multiple sites of alternative splicing within a single gene exponentially increase the number of possible spliced isoforms. with most human genes currently estimated to express at least ten. To understand the mechanisms underlying these complex isoform expression patterns. methods are needed that faithfully maintain long-range exon connectivity information in individual RNA molecules. In this study. we describe SeqZip. a methodology that uses RNA-templated DNA–DNA ligation to retain and compress connectivity between distant sequences within single RNA molecules.

The functional implications of this newly characterized estrogen signaling system have begun to emerge. This essay summarizes evidence in support of the hypothesis that the rapid production of estrogens in brain circuits can drive acute changes in both the production and perception of acoustic communication behaviors. These studies have revealed two fundamental neurobiological concepts: (1) estrogens can be locally produced in brain circuits. independent of levels in nearby circuits and in the circulation and (2) estrogens can have very rapid effects within these brain circuits to modulate social vocalizations. acoustic processing. and sensorimotor integration.

After assembly the spliceosome is activated for catalysis by rearrangement of subunits to form an active site. How this rearrangement is coordinated is not well-understood. During activation. U4 must be released to allow U6 conformational change. while Prp19 complex (NTC) recruitment is essential for stabilizing the active site. We used multi-wavelength colocalization single molecule spectroscopy to directly observe the key events in Saccharomyces cerevisiae spliceosome activation. Following binding of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. the spliceosome either reverses assembly by discarding tri-snRNP or proceeds to activation by irreversible U4 loss. The major pathway for NTC recruitment occurs after U4 release. ATP stimulates both the competing U4 release and tri-snRNP discard processes. The data reveal the activation mechanism and show that overall splicing efficiency may be maintained through repeated rounds of disassembly and tri-snRNP reassociation.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14166.001,True,iRaegw8AAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,32,https://elifesciences.org/articles/14166,11294512101682389284,/scholar?cites=11294512101682389284,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/14166.pdf,0,0,0

Consistent with continuum Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) electrostatics. the membrane is approximated as an solvent-inaccessible infinite planar low-dielectric slab.

The structure and dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids are well characterized in vitro. but in vivo crowding effects remain unclear. Using molecular dynamics simulations of a comprehensive atomistic model cytoplasm we found that protein-protein interactions may destabilize native protein structures. whereas metabolite interactions may induce more compact states due to electrostatic screening. Protein-protein interactions also resulted in significant variations in reduced macromolecular diffusion under crowded conditions. while metabolites exhibited significant two-dimensional surface diffusion and altered protein-ligand binding that may reduce the effective concentration of metabolites and ligands in vivo. Metabolic enzymes showed weak non-specific association in cellular environments attributed to solvation and entropic effects. These effects are expected to have broad implications for the in vivo functioning of biomolecules.

A. C.; Sarkar. M.; Wang. Y.; Pielak. G. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc.2011. 133. 7116). The simulations confirm a destabilization and significantly slowed diffusion of CI2 in the presence of lysozyme and indicate that this observation is a result of extensive. nonspecific protein–protein interactions between CI2 and lysozyme. CI2 interacts much less with BSA crowders corresponding to a weak effect of crowding.

Inc.,Protein structures are essential in modern biology yet experimental methods are far from being able to catch up with the rapid increase in available genomic data. Computational protein structure prediction methods aim to fill the gap while the role of protein structure refinement is to take approximate initial template‐based models and bring them closer to the true native structure. Current methods for computational structure refinement rely on molecular dynamics simulations. related sampling methods. or iterative structure optimization protocols. The best methods are able to achieve moderate degrees of refinement but consistent refinement that can reach near‐experimental accuracy remains elusive.

111539,Recent advances in transferable coarse-grained modeling of proteins,2014,Parimal Kar and Michael Feig,96,,,143-180,Academic Press,Computer simulations are indispensable tools for studying the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules. Biochemical processes occur on different scales of length and time. Atomistic simulations cannot cover the relevant spatiotemporal scales at which the cellular processes occur. To address this challenge. coarse-grained (CG) modeling of the biological systems is employed. Over the last few years. many CG models for proteins continue to be developed. However. many of them are not transferable with respect to different systems and different environments. In this review. we discuss those CG protein models that are transferable and that retain chemical specificity. We restrict ourselves to CG models of soluble proteins only.

The first step in mismatch repair is the recognition of base-base mismatches and insertions/deletions by bacterial MutS or eukaryotic MSH2-MSH6. Crystal structures of both proteins bound to mismatch DNA reveal a similar molecular architecture but provide limited insight into the detailed molecular mechanism of long-range allostery involved in mismatch recognition and repair initiation. This study describes normal-mode calculations of MutS and MSH2-MSH6 with and without DNA. The results reveal similar protein flexibilities and suggest common dynamic and functional characteristics.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,A correlation‐based approach is introduced for enhancing the ability of structure‐scoring methods to identify and distinguish native‐like conformations. The proposed method relies on a funnel‐shaped scoring function that decreases steadily toward the native state. It takes advantage of the idea that the structure from a given ensemble that is closest to the native basin leads to the highest correlation coefficient between a given score and distance to that structure as an approximation of the native state for the entire ensemble. The method is applied successfully to a number of different test cases that demonstrate substantial improvements in the correlation of the score with the distance from the true native state but also result in the selection of more native‐like structures compared to the original score.

Cluster formation as a result of transient intermolecular contacts was identified as the dominant effect for reduced rotational diffusion upon crowding. The slow-down in diffusion was primarily correlated with direct protein–protein contacts rather than indirect interactions via shared hydration layers. But increased solvent viscosity due to crowding contributed to a lesser extent. Key protein–protein contacts correlated with a slow-down in diffusion involve largely interactions between charged and polar groups suggesting that the surface composition of a given protein and the resulting propensity for forming interactions with surrounding proteins in a crowded cellular environment may be the major determinant of its diffusive properties.,True,DkeaoNoAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC,27,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/cp/c8cp06142d,4893239165094392324,/scholar?cites=4893239165094392324,,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/getauthorversionpdf/c8cp06142d,0,0,0

The dephosphorylated state of full-length monomeric myosin is characterized by an asymmetric intramolecular head–head interaction that completely inhibits the ATPase activity. accompanied by a hairpin fold of the tail. which prevents filament assembly. Phosphorylation of serine 19 disrupts these head–head interactions by an unknown mechanism. Computational modeling (Tama et al.. 2005. J. Mol.

Conserved modes are identified that involve translocation of the nucleic acid complex coupled to motions of the enzyme. in particular in the clamp and jaw domains of RNAPII. A combination of these modes is hypothesized to be involved during active transcription. The NMA modes indicate furthermore that downstream DNA translocation may occur separately from DNA:RNA hybrid translocation.

In E. coli. the DNA helicase is DnaB and DnaC is its loading partner. We used the method of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to address the importance of DnaB–DnaC complex formation as a prerequisite for helicase loading. Our results show that the DnaB ring opens and closes. and that specific amino acids near the N-terminus of DnaC interact with a site in DnaB's C-terminal domain to trap it as an open ring. This event correlates with conformational changes of the RecA fold of DnaB that is involved in nucleotide binding. and of the AAA+ domain of DnaC. DnaC also causes an alteration of the helical hairpins in the N-terminal domain of DnaB. presumably occluding this region from interacting with primase. Hence.

Different dielectric environments were used to model one aspect of cellular environments.

Repeats of 21–37 bp typically show weak dyad symmetry and are separated by regularly sized. nonrepetitive spacer sequences. Four CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families. designated Cas1 to Cas4. are strictly associated with CRISPR elements and always occur near a repeat cluster. Some spacers originate from mobile genetic elements and are thought to confer “immunity” against the elements that harbor these sequences. In the present study. we have systematically investigated uncharacterized proteins encoded in the vicinity of these CRISPRs and found many additional protein families that are strictly associated with CRISPR loci across multiple prokaryotic species. Multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models have been built for 45 Cas protein families. These models identify family members with high sensitivity and selectivity and classify key regulators of development. DevR and DevS. in Myxococcus xanthus as Cas proteins. These identifications show that CRISPR/cas gene regions can be quite large. with up to 20 different. tandem-arranged cas genes next to a repeat cluster or filling the region between two repeat clusters.

An increase in drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis demonstrates the need for additional TB-specific drugs. A notable feature of M. tuberculosis is coenzyme F420. which is distributed sporadically and sparsely among prokaryotes. This distribution allows for comparative genomics-based investigations. Phylogenetic profiling (comparison of differential gene content) based on F420 biosynthesis nominated many actinobacterial proteins as candidate F420-dependent enzymes. Three such families dominated the results: the luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM). pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate oxidase (PPOX). and deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase (DDN) families.

Comparative analysis of eight leptospiral genomes shows the existence of a core leptospiral genome comprising 1547 genes and 452 conserved genes restricted to infectious species (including L. licerasiae) that are likely to be pathogenicity-related. Comparisons of the functional content of the genomes suggests that L. licerasiae retains several proteins related to nitrogen. amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism which might help to explain why these Leptospira grow well in artificial media compared with pathogenic species. L. licerasiae strains VAR010T and MMD0835 possess two prophage elements. While one element is circular and shares homology with LE1 of L. biflexa. the second is cryptic and homologous to a previously identified but unnamed region in L. interrogans serovars Copenhageni and Lai. We also report a unique O-antigen locus in L. licerasiae comprised of a 6-gene cluster that is unexpectedly short compared with L. interrogans in which analogous regions may include >90 such genes.

111611,ProPhylo: partial phylogenetic profiling to guide protein family construction and assignment of biological process,2011,Malay K Basu and Jeremy D Selengut and Daniel H Haft,12,BMC bioinformatics,1,434,BioMed Central,Phylogenetic profiling is a technique of scoring co-occurrence between a protein family and some other trait. usually another protein family. across a set of taxonomic groups. In spite of several refinements in recent years. the technique still invites significant improvement. To be its most effective. a phylogenetic profiling algorithm must be able to examine co-occurrences among protein families whose boundaries are uncertain within large homologous protein superfamilies. Partial Phylogenetic Profiling (PPP) is an iterative algorithm that scores a given taxonomic profile against the taxonomic distribution of families for all proteins in a genome. The method works through optimizing the boundary of each protein family. rather than by relying on prebuilt protein families or fixed sequence similarity thresholds. Double Partial Phylogenetic Profiling (DPPP) is a related procedure that begins with a single sequence and searches for optimal granularities for its surrounding protein family in order to generate the best query profiles for PPP. We present ProPhylo. a high-performance software package for phylogenetic profiling studies through creating individually optimized protein family boundaries. ProPhylo provides precomputed databases for immediate use and tools for manipulating the taxonomic profiles used as queries. ProPhylo results show universal markers of methanogenesis. a new DNA phosphorothioation-dependent restriction enzyme. and efficacy in guiding protein family construction.

We introduce Sites Inferred by Metabolic Background Assertion Labeling (SIMBAL). a method that applies the Partial Phylogenetic Profiling (PPP) approach locally within a protein sequence to discover short sequence signatures associated with functional sites. The approach is based on the basic scoring mechanism employed by PPP. namely the use of binomial distribution statistics to optimize sequence similarity cutoffs during searches of partitioned training sets. Here we illustrate and validate the ability of the SIMBAL method to find functionally relevant short sequence signatures by application to two well-characterized protein families. In the first example. we partitioned a family of ABC permeases using a metabolic background property (urea utilization). Thus. the TRUE set for this family comprised members whose genome of origin encoded a urea utilization system. By moving a sliding window across the sequence of a permease. and searching each subsequence in turn against the full set of partitioned proteins. the method found which local sequence signatures best correlated with the urea utilization trait. Mapping of SIMBAL ""hot spots"" onto crystal structures of homologous permeases reveals that the significant sites are gating determinants on the cytosolic face rather than. say. docking sites for the substrate-binding protein on the extracellular face. In the second example. we partitioned a protein methyltransferase family using gene proximity as a criterion.

111617,Equivalog protein families in the TIGRFAMs database,2004,Jeremy D Selengut and Daniel H Haft,,"Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics and Bioinformatics",,,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd,An equivalog is a family of proteins conserved in function since their last common ancestor. This term differs from the term ortholog. which is not limited to groups with conserved function but is strictly limited to speciation events (and excludes horizontal gene transfers). Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are mathematical constructs representing multiple sequence alignments. The TIGRFAMs database includes a large number of HMMs that represent equivalog families. The great utility of these models is that a sequence scoring higher than a threshold value versus an equivalog has a very high likelihood of being a member of the family and sharing the same function. Equivalog HMMs are useful in automatic genome annotation. The information that is manually attached to a gene by an annotator is instead attached to the equivalog HMM. This is then used to transfer the information automatically to the appropriate genes …,True,UpghuIkAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,0,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/047001153X.g306305,,,,,0,0,0

111624,Studies in biochemistry--steroid synthesis. P-450 enzymology and renal lithogenesis,1994,Jeremy David Selengut,,,,,,I. A method for the synthesis of lanosterol (Lanosta-8. 24-dien-3p-ol) is developed such that isotopes of hydrogen can be specifically introduced into the C-32 position of the molecule. Lanosterol labeled with tritium in this way is suitable for use in recently developed assay methods for lanosterol-14ox-demethylase. a P-450 enzyme responsible for the common step in the synthesis of cholesterol and ergosterol from lanosterol. This enzyme is known to be the target of an important class of anti-fungal drugs and therefore has been the focus of considerable industrial. clinical and scientific interest. This synthesis is the first to preserve both of the double bonds in the lanosterol molecule and thus provide specifically labeled samples of the natural substrate for the mammalian and yeast enzymes. and additionally provides access to new molecules modified at the C-32 position and posessing the proper side-chain configuration. The synthesis is based on previous syntheses of C-32-modified dihydrolanosterol (Lanost-8-en-30-ol) and significant improvements to several literature methods are provided. II.

After denervating and damaging muscle. we allowed myofibers to regenerate but deliberately prevented reinnervation. The distribution of acetylcholine receptors on regenerating myofibers was determined by histological methods. using [125I] alpha-bungarotoxin or horseradish peroxidase-alpha-bungarotoxin; original synaptic sites on the basal lamina sheaths were marked by cholinesterase stain.

Beta-lactams diffuse into but do not accumulate in phagocytes. probably because of their acidic character. Aminoglycosides are too polar to pass across membranes and are therefore only taken up slowly by endocytosis. which results in an exclusively lysosomal localization. Lincosaminides. macrolides and fluoroquinolones all accumulate in phagocytes. the two former classes of drugs showing both a cytosolic and a lysosomal localization.

A common method is to use measurements of concentrations in tissue homogenates. comparing these with values derived from the corresponding blood samples and on that basis draw conclusions with respect to the potential clinical use of the drug. This approach is not justifiable for a number of reasons that includes both pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic causes.

We show that treatment of rats with Gentamicin (10 mg/kg. 7 days) induces a loss of activity of lysosomal sphingomyelinase and phospholipase A1. associated with an increase in the amount of total lipid phosphorus in the kidney cortex. In vitro. Gentamicin is shown by gel permeation to bind to phospholipid bilayers (liposomes) under conditions which mimic the lysosomal environment (acid pH and presence of phosphatidylinositol). The reversal of this binding by an increase in the ionic strength (less than 0.04) suggests electrostatic interaction between the hydrophilic. polycationic aminoglycoside and the negatively charged phospholipids. Binding of Gentamicin impairs the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine present in the bilayer. by lysosomal phospholipases A1 and A2 from the liver or kidney. We also show that lysosomal sphingomyelinase is readily and irreversibly inactivated by liposomes in the absence of detergent. The lysosomal phospholipidosis induced by Gentamicin in the kidney. as in cultured cells [Aubert-Tulkens et al.. Lab. Invest. 40. 481 (1979)] appears therefore to be a direct consequence of the lysosomotropic character of this drug and its ability to inhibit therein phospholipid breakdown. Amikacin. a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside. binds more loosely to phospholipid bilayers. induces less inhibition of phospholipases in vitro and is less taken up by tubular cells in vivo. Accordingly.

This protein extrudes a large range of components out of cells. especially therapeutic agents causing a phenomenon known as multidrug resistance. Because of its clinical interest. its activity and transport function have been largely characterized by various biochemical studies. In the absence of a high-resolution structure of P-glycoprotein. homology modeling is a useful tool to help interpretation of experimental data and potentially guide experimental studies. We present here three-dimensional models of two different catalytic states of P-glycoprotein that were developed based on the crystal structures of two bacterial multidrug transporters. Our models are supported by a large body of biochemical data. Measured inter-residue distances correlate well with distances derived from cross-linking data. The nucleotide-free model features a large cavity detected in the protein core into which ligands of different size were successfully docked. The locations of docked ligands compare favorably with those suggested by drug binding site mutants. Our models can interpret the effects of several mutants in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). within the transmembrane domains (TMDs) or at the NBD:TMD interface. The docking results suggest that the protein has multiple binding sites in agreement with experimental evidence. The nucleotide-bound models are exploited to propose different pathways of signal transmission upon ATP binding/hydrolysis which could lead to the elaboration of …,True,i6ScB1EAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,93,https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-9-3,12260472878477490608,/scholar?cites=12260472878477490608,,https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-9-3,0,0,0

Azithromycin demonstrates an exceptionally large accumulation in all the cell types tested (perhaps in two functionally and structurally distinct compartments) and a slow release of the cell-associated drug. Azithromycin probably accumulates in cells by a non-specific transport process following the model of diffusion/segregation. The cell-associated drug distributes mostly in the lysosomal compartment (50-70%) and the remaining part is freely soluble in the cytosol. In fibroblasts. and to a lesser extent in NRK-cells. azithromycin (10mg/l) induces a decrease of the buoyant density of the lysosomes which may be brought about by the drug itself together with osmotically-bound water and/or by the accumulation of low-density materials within these organelles. These observations open important questions with respect to the potential toxicity of azithromycin.

It shows improved activity. including against linezolid-resistant strains. Radezolid differs from linezolid by the presence of a biaryl spacer and of a heteroaryl side chain. which increases the ionization and hydrophilicity of the molecule at physiological pH and confers to it a dibasic character. The aim of this study was to determine the accumulation and subcellular distribution of radezolid in phagocytic cells and to decipher the underlying mechanisms. In THP-1 human macrophages. J774 mouse macrophages. and human polymorphonuclear neutrophils. radezolid accumulated rapidly and reversibly (half-lives of approximately 6 min and 9 min for uptake and efflux. respectively) to reach. at equilibrium. a cellular concentration 11-fold higher than the extracellular one.

This change may be the consequence of nickel's interference with the function of several Fe(II)-dependent enzymes. In this study. the effects of soluble nickel exposure on cellular iron homeostasis were investigated. Nickel treatment decreased both mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase (c-aconitase) activity in A549 cells. Cytosolic aconitase was converted to iron-regulatory protein 1. a form critical for the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis.

Knowledge of the structure of the true Michaelis complex might provide additional insights into the intrinsic protein hydrolysis mechanism of GTP and related nucleotides.Results: The structure of the complex formed between p21ras and GTP has been determined by X-ray diffraction at 1.6 Å using a combination of photolysis of an inactive GTP precursor (caged GTP) and rapid freezing (100K).

It is concluded that. at every step of the ATPase cycle. the association between the two proteins takes place in two stages. The equilibrium constant of the second step and thus the affinity of S1 for actin changes from step to step during the enzymatic reaction.It is proposed that the transient kinetic evidence can be interpreted in terms of two different classes of contraction models. The first one. which is widely used at present. identifies particular steps in the enzymatic reaction as directly responsible for the conformational change which represents the power stroke of muscle contraction (direct coupling model).

The phosphate vibrations were analyzed using site specifically 18O-labeled caged GTP isotopomers. One nonbridging oxygen per nucleotide was replaced for an 18O isotope in the α-. β-. or γ-position of the phosphate chain. In photolysis experiments with free caged GTP. strong vibrational coupling was observed among all phosphate groups.

NVM results presumably from a congenital developmental error and has been traced back to single point mutations in various genes. The objective of this study was to determine the underlying genetic defect in a large German family suffering from NVM. Twenty four family members were clinically assessed using advanced imaging techniques. For molecular characterization. a genome-wide linkage analysis was undertaken and the disease locus was mapped to chromosome 14ptel-14q12. Subsequently. two genes of the disease interval.

The mutation was exclusively present in morphologically affected family members. A few members of the family displayed NVM in combination with other heart defects. such as dislocation of the tricuspid valve (Ebstein's anomaly. EA) and atrial septal defect (ASD).

MSS4 was shown to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Rab proteins associated with the exocytic pathway and to have nucleotide‐free‐Rab chaperone activity. A detailed kinetic analysis of MSS4 interaction with Rab8 showed that MSS4 is a relatively slow exchange factor that forms a long‐lived nucleotide‐free complex with RabGTPase. In contrast to other characterized exchange factor–GTPase complexes. MSS4:Rab8 complex binds GTP faster than GDP. but still ca. 3 orders of magnitude more slowly than comparable complexes. The crystal structure of the nucleotide‐free MSS4:Rab8 complex revealed that MSS4 binds to the Switch I and interswitch regions of Rab8. forming an intermolecular β‐sheet.

This function depends on the N-terminal myristoylation of Nef. a lipid modification that targets the protein to membranes. We have analyzed how specific membrane properties and sequence motifs within Nef determine this interaction. Using time-resolved techniques we find that the association with membranes is a biphasic process with a fast rate for an electrostatic-driven protein-liposome interaction and a slow rate for the formation of an amphipathic helix.

Its affinity for guanosine nucleotides is severely reduced. with a concomitant increase in the affinity for xanthosine nucleotides. which leads to an almost complete reversal of base specificity. The protein is a GTPase as well as a XTPase and the hydrolysis reaction can be efficiently stimulated by GAP. Dissociation of XDP from the mutant is stimulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc25Mm in a similar manner to that of GDP from wildtype. The interaction of the mutant with the effector domain of c-Raf kinase or Ral-GEF is normal. In microinjection experiments in PC12 and NIH3T3 cells the protein behaves as an oncogenic mutant due to its high dissociation rate for GDP.

Ltd,The DrrA protein of Legionella pneumophila is involved in mistargeting of endoplasmic reticulum‐derived vesicles to Legionella‐containing vacuoles through recruitment of the small GTPase Rab1. To this effect. DrrA binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 4‐phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) lipids on the cytosolic surface of the phagosomal membrane shortly after infection. In this study. we present the atomic structure of the PtdIns(4)P‐binding domain of a protein (DrrA) from a human pathogen. A detailed kinetic investigation of its interaction with PtdIns(4)P reveals that DrrA binds to this phospholipid with. as yet unprecedented. high affinity. suggesting that DrrA can sense a very low abundance of the lipid.,True,fRv9rT8AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC,90,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/embor.2010.97,16990015026688825356,/scholar?cites=16990015026688825356,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/embor.2010.97,0,0,0

For many purposes. it may suffice to know that it occurs by a sliding movement of two different kinds of filaments. which are the main constituents of a muscle sarcomere. and that these filaments retain a constant length during the contraction (the sliding filament model [1-7]). At a level of higher spatial resolution. this sliding is thought to be caused by radial projections (crossbridges) originating on the thicker filaments. which interact with the thin filaments in a cyclic fashion. and by changes of angle propel the thin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere (rowing boat model [8. 9]). Going a step further. and knowing that this cyclic process is accompanied by the hydrolysis of the high-energy polyphosphate ATP. we may wish to know what sort of changes of shape. conformation or configuration of the cross-bridges …,True,fRv9rT8AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,89,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304417383900095,5658371087718756657,/scholar?cites=5658371087718756657,,,0,0,0

GAPs and motor proteins: common thermodynamic and kinetic principles for different functions,2002,Roger S Goody and Waltraud Hofmann-Goody,31,,4,268-274,Springer-Verlag, In this article. we review the properties of several classes of proteins that interact with ATPases and GTPases involved in energy and signal transduction. We show that certain common basic thermodynamic principles apply to the manner in which the nucleotide hydrolases interact with their partner molecules. and that the principles involved in signal transduction can be quantitatively modified to give systems with the known properties of energy transducing systems. As an example. actin can be described as an exchange factor for myosin. with its exchange activity being specific for ATP or inorganic phosphate in the myosin.ADP.Pi complex. in contrast to the unspecific exchange activity of guanosine nucleotide exchange factors operating on GTPases involved in signal transduction and regulatory processes.

By analyzing ribosome stalling at the regulatory cistron of the antibiotic resistance gene ermA. we uncovered a carefully orchestrated cooperation between the ribosomal exit tunnel and the A-site of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in halting translation. The presence of an inducing antibiotic and a specific nascent peptide in the exit tunnel abrogate the ability of the PTC to catalyze peptide bond formation with a particular subset of amino acids. The extent of the conferred A-site selectivity is modulated by the C-terminal segment of the nascent …,True,niZDz1cAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,119,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276510010403,404615867346968817,/scholar?cites=404615867346968817,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276510010403,0,0,0

This principle has been successfully applied in single-molecule. real-time (SMRT®) DNA sequencing for the detection of DNA sequences and DNA base modifications. In contrast. RNA sequencing methods cannot provide sequence and RNA base modifications concurrently as they rely on complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis by reverse transcription followed by sequencing of cDNA. Thus. information on RNA modifications is lost during the process of cDNA synthesis. Here we describe an application of SMRT technology to follow the activity of reverse transcriptase enzymes synthesizing cDNA on thousands of single RNA templates simultaneously in real time with single nucleotide turnover resolution using arrays of ZMWs. This method thereby obtains information from the RNA template directly. The analysis of the kinetics of the reverse transcriptase can be used to identify RNA base modifications. shown by example for N6-methyladenine (m6A) in oligonucleotides and in a specific mRNA extracted from total cellular mRNA. Furthermore. the real-time reverse transcriptase dynamics informs about RNA secondary structure and its rearrangements. as demonstrated on a ribosomal RNA and an mRNA template.

111943,Gemini surfactants with acetylenic spacers,2000,FM Menger and JS Keiper and V Azov,16,Langmuir,5,2062-2067,American Chemical Society,A total of 24 dicationic geminis surfactants were synthesized. having a 2-butynyl spacer and chain lengths varying from 8 to 18 carbons. Geminis with more flexible butyl spacers were also synthesized for comparison purposes. Tensiometry gave critical micelle concentration (cmc) values. surface activity. and Gibbs areas. Film studies on the C18 geminis gave liftoff and collapse areas. The acetylenic geminis behave normally with the log cmc values decreasing linearly with chain length for all the dibromide salts. Anomalous behavior occurred. however. with the C18 gemini having a butyl spacer. It was found that cmc data correlate with spacer area. a relationship ascribed to packing constraints on curved surfaces and. possibly. to steric inhibition of ion binding.

Sulfoxide is formed exclusively and quantitatively. As much as 1 mL of sulfide can be oxidized by 15 mL of microemulsion. The process is much faster than phase-transfer catalysis and requires no stirring since the microemulsions are homogeneous. The cosurfactant in the microemulsion (a low molecular weight alcohol) is shown to play a central role in the oxidation by acting as an intermediary between the oil-soluble mustard and the water-soluble hypochlorite. The microemulsion-based method is simple. cheap. mild. selective. and rapid.

Methyl Orange (MO) and Congo Red (CR). with a series of gemini cationic surfactants and dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB) in aqueous solution have been investigated by means of UV–Vis spectroscopy.

Aggregations with anionic dyes were reflected by hypsochromic shifts with a decrease in the intensity of absorption band. Further addition of surfactant results in an absorption spectrum of the dye characteristic in the presence of cationic micelles.

This approach presupposes that the interface is saturated in the “Gibbs region.” thereby allowing a single unique area to be calculated. We show that the areas derived by the Gibbs equation (typically 50−60 Å2/molecule) are much too large to account for the abrupt surface tension decline. Moreover. a surface tension/concentration plot was observed for a system where micelle formation does not interfere with the Gibbs region. Nonetheless. the surface tension plot leveled off. ostensibly owing to saturation. when the Gibbs approach predicted a continued linear decline. proving that the interface in the Gibbs region is not saturated as generally assumed.
