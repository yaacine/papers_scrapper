46927,Solubilization of membranes by detergents,1975,Ari Helenius and KAI Simons,415,,1,29-79,Elsevier,30 membrane structure and function it is usually necessary to dissociate the membrane into its components. The techniques for extraction and analysis of the membrane lipids are well worked out. and are mainly based on the use of organic solvents. These have also been used to extract the proteins. but the resultant irreversible aggregation and denaturation of many membrane proteins limit their usefulness. Partial and selective protein solubilization can be obtained by a number of methods involving chelating agents. manipulation of ionic strength and pH. Protein perturbants (ie urea. guanidine and chaotropic agents) and enzymatic digestion have also been used. However. these procedures do not lead to solubilization of the proteins which are more strongly bound to the lipid matrix of the membrane. For such proteins the use of detergents (synthetic detergents. bile salts and saponins) appears to provide the most …,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3512,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304415775900167,13805842310368839172,/scholar?cites=13805842310368839172,,,0
46928,Intracellular functions of N-linked glycans,2001,Ari Helenius and Markus Aebi,291,,5512,2364-2369,American Association for the Advancement of Science,N-linked oligosaccharides arise when blocks of 14 sugars are added cotranslationally to newly synthesized polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These glycans are then subjected to extensive modification as the glycoproteins mature and move through the ER via the Golgi complex to their final destinations inside and outside the cell. In the ER and in the early secretory pathway. where the repertoire of oligosaccharide structures is still rather small. the glycans play a pivotal role in protein folding. oligomerization. quality control. sorting. and transport. They are used as universal “tags” that allow specific lectins and modifying enzymes to establish order among the diversity of maturing glycoproteins. In the Golgi complex. the glycans acquire more complex structures and a new set of functions. The division of synthesis and processing between the ER and the Golgi complex represents an evolutionary …,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2625,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/291/5512/2364.abstract,17971229660676432049,/scholar?cites=17971229660676432049,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7c62/7bc792c82e63e320ef7b889105a04505521b.pdf,0

Non-native conformers and incompletely assembled oligomers are retained. and. if misfolded persistently. they are degraded. As a large fraction of ER-synthesized proteins fail to fold and mature properly. ER quality control is important for the fidelity of cellular functions.

46930,Acidification of the endocytic and exocytic pathways,1986,Ira Mellman and Renate Fuchs and Ari Helenius,55,,1,663-700,Annual Reviews,Most of the membrane organelles in a typical eukaryotic cell belong to the elements of the exo-and endocytic pathways. referred to collectively as the vacuolar system. They include the endoplasmic reticulum. the Golgi complex. the secretory vacuoles. the endosomes. and the lysosomes and other organelles involved in biosynthesis. processing. transport. storage. release. and degrada tion of soluble and membrane-bound macromolecules. Both the inward-and the outward-directed pathways consist of a series of organelles through which material passes in an orderly and sequential fashion by means of specific transport vesicles and membrane fission and fusion reactions.

46931,Roles of N-linked glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum,2004,Ari Helenius and Markus Aebi,73,,1,1019-1049,Annual Reviews,From a process involved in cell wall synthesis in archaea and some bacteria. N-linked glycosylation has evolved into the most common covalent protein modification in eukaryotic cells. The sugars are added to nascent proteins as a core oligosaccharide unit. which is then extensively modified by removal and addition of sugar residues in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex. It has become evident that the modifications that take place in the ER reflect a spectrum of functions related to glycoprotein folding. quality control. sorting. degradation. and secretion. The glycans not only promote folding directly by stabilizing polypeptide structures but also indirectly by serving as recognition “tags” that allow glycoproteins to interact with a variety of lectins. glycosidases. and glycosyltranferases. Some of these (such as glucosidases I and II. calnexin. and calreticulin) have a central role in folding and …,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,2078,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073752,5656033163458240012,/scholar?cites=5656033163458240012,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ari_Helenius/publication/8518479_Helenius_A_Aebi_M_Roles_of_N-linked_glycans_in_the_endoplasmic_reticulum_Annu_Rev_Biochem_73_1019-1049/links/00b7d52d41611d567d000000.pdf,0

Ltd,Being deeply connected to signalling. cell dynamics. growth. regulation. and defence. endocytic processes are linked to almost all aspects of cell life and disease. In this review. we focus on endosomes in the classical endocytic pathway. and on the programme of changes that lead to the formation and maturation of late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. The maturation programme entails a dramatic transformation of these dynamic organelles disconnecting them functionally and spatially from early endosomes and preparing them for their unidirectional role as a feeder pathway to lysosomes.,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,1736,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/emboj.2011.286,8592150850100296781,/scholar?cites=8592150850100296781,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/emboj.2011.286,0

46933,Caveolar endocytosis of simian virus 40 reveals a new two-step vesicular-transport pathway to the ER,2001,Lucas Pelkmans and Jürgen Kartenbeck and Ari Helenius,3,Nature cell biology,5,473-483,Nature Publishing Group,Simian virus 40 (SV40) is unusual among animal viruses in that it enters cells through caveolae. and the internalized virus accumulates in a smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment. Using video-enhanced. dual-colour. live fluorescence microscopy. we show the uptake of individual virus particles in CV-1 cells. After associating with caveolae. SV40 leaves the plasma membrane in small. caveolin-1-containing vesicles. It then enters larger. peripheral organelles with a non-acidic pH. Although rich in caveolin-1. these organelles do not contain markers for endosomes. lysosomes. ER or Golgi. nor do they acquire ligands of clathrin-coated vesicle endocytosis. After several hours in these organelles.

46934,Setting the standards: quality control in the secretory pathway,1999,Lars Ellgaard and Maurizio Molinari and Ari Helenius,286,,5446,1882-1888,American Association for the Advancement of Science,A variety of quality control mechanisms operate in the endoplasmic reticulum and in downstream compartments of the secretory pathway to ensure the fidelity and regulation of protein expression during cell life and differentiation. As a rule. only proteins that pass a stringent selection process are transported to their target organelles and compartments. If proper maturation fails. the aberrant products are degraded. Quality control improves folding efficiency by retaining proteins in the special folding environment of the endoplasmic reticulum. and it prevents harmful effects that could be caused by the deployment of incompletely folded or assembled proteins.,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1385,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/286/5446/1882.abstract,14691204740252744548,/scholar?cites=14691204740252744548,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ari_Helenius/publication/12717242_Setting_the_Standards_Quality_Control_in_the_Secretory_Pathway/links/004635188e5282201b000000/Setting-the-Standards-Quality-Control-in-the-Secretory-Pathway.pdf,0

Our results show that incoming adenovirus type 2 particles undergo a stepwise disassembly program necessary to allow progress of the virus in the entry pathway and release of the genome into the nucleus. The fibers are released. the penton base structures dissociated. the proteins connecting the DNA to the inside surface of the capsid degraded or shed. and the capsid-stabilizing minor proteins eliminated.

Inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation (tunicamycin) and glucosidases I and II (castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin) prevented the association. whereas inhibitors of ER alpha-mannosidases did not.
