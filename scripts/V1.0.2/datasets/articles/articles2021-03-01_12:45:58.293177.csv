East Africa,2003,Erik Verheyen and Walter Salzburger and Jos Snoeks and Axel Meyer,300,Science,5617,325-329,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Lake Victoria harbors a unique species-rich flock of more than 500 endemic haplochromine cichlid fishes. The origin. age. and mechanism of diversification of this extraordinary radiation are still debated. Geological evidence suggests that the lake dried out completely about 14.700 years ago. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses of almost 300 DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region of East African cichlids. we find that the Lake Victoria cichlid flock is derived from the geologically older Lake Kivu. We suggest that the two seeding lineages may have already been lake-adapted when they colonized Lake Victoria. A haplotype analysis further shows that the most recent desiccation of Lake Victoria did not lead to a complete extinction of its endemic cichlid fauna and that the major lineage diversification took place about 100.000 years ago.,True,yyZkp90AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,446,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/300/5617/325.abstract,3225607333458225655,/scholar?cites=3225607333458225655,,http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/8718/P139.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

About 80% of all 2.500 cichlid species in East Africa. and virtually all cichlid species from Lakes Victoria (~500 species) and Malawi (~1.000 species) are haplochromines. Here. we present the most extensive phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis so far that includes about 100 species and is based on about 2.000 bp of the mitochondrial DNA. Our analyses revealed that all haplochromine lineages are ultimately derived from Lake Tanganyika endemics. We find that the three most ancestral lineages of the haplochromines sensu lato are relatively species poor. albeit widely distributed in Africa. whereas a fourth newly defined lineage – the 'modern haplochromines' – contains an unparalleled diversity that makes up more than 7% of the worlds' ~25.000 teleost species. The modern haplochromines' ancestor. most likely a riverine generalist. repeatedly gave rise to similar ecomorphs now found in several of the species flocks. Also. the Tanganyikan Tropheini are derived from that riverine ancestor suggesting that they successfully re-colonized Lake Tanganyika and speciated in parallel to an already established cichlid adaptive radiation. In contrast to most other known examples of adaptive radiations. these generalist ancestors were derived from highly diverse and specialized endemics from Lake Tanganyika. A reconstruction of life-history traits revealed that in an ancestral lineage leading to the modern haplochromines the characteristic egg-spots on anal fins of male individuals evolved.

However. observed allele lengths are usually inaccurate and may deviate from the expected periodicity of repeats. The common practice of rounding to the nearest whole number frequently results in miscalls and underestimations of allelic richness.

Despite recent advances in evolutionary and developmental genetics. the mechanisms that underlie adaptation. diversification and evolutionary innovation remain largely unknown. The exceptionally diverse species flocks of cichlid fishes are textbook examples of adaptive radiation and explosive speciation and emerge as powerful model systems to study the genetic basis of animal diversification. East Africa's hundreds of endemic cichlid species are akin to a natural mutagenesis screen and differ greatly not only in ecologically relevant (hence naturally selected) characters such as mouth morphology and body shape. but also in sexually selected traits such as coloration.

The genetic foundations of this divergence process are largely unknown and are here explored through genome scans in multiple independent lake–stream population pairs of threespine stickleback. We find that across the pairs. overall genomic divergence is associated with the magnitude of divergence in phenotypes known to be under divergent selection. Along this same axis of increasing diversification. genomic divergence becomes increasingly biased towards the centre of chromosomes as opposed to the peripheries. We explain this pattern by within‐chromosome variation in the physical extent of hitchhiking. as recombination is greatly reduced in chromosome centres.

A neglected factor during the modern evolutionary synthesis. adaptive phenotypic plasticity. more recently attracted the attention of many evolutionary biologists and is now recognized as an important ingredient in both population persistence and diversification.

On the basis of genome-wide SNP marker data generated by RAD sequencing of lake and stream stickleback populations. we show that the outcome of such studies can be systematically biased if markers with a low minor allele frequency are included in the analysis.

We first use individual‐based simulations to demonstrate that comparisons between populations adapted in parallel to similar environments from shared variation reveal a characteristic genomic signature around a selected locus: a low‐divergence valley centred at the locus and flanked by twin peaks of high divergence. This signature is initiated by the hitchhiking of haplotype tracts differing between derived populations in the broader neighbourhood of the selected locus (driving the high‐divergence twin peaks) and shared haplotype tracts in the tight neighbourhood of the locus (driving the low‐divergence valley).

Swords are one of only few examples where the hypothesis of a pre‐existing bias is believed to apply for the evolution of a male trait. Previous laboratory experiments demonstrated that females prefer males with longer swords and even females from some swordless species show an affiliation for males of sworded species. Earlier phylogenetic studies based on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA placed the sworded southern swordtail Xiphophorus clemenciae with swordless platies. contradicting its morphology‐based evolutionary affinities.

1096296,On the origin and trigger of the notothenioid adaptive radiation,2011,Michael Matschiner and Reinhold Hanel and Walter Salzburger,6,PLoS one,4,e18911,Public Library of Science,Adaptive radiation is usually triggered by ecological opportunity. arising through (i) the colonization of a new habitat by its progenitor; (ii) the extinction of competitors; or (iii) the emergence of an evolutionary key innovation in the ancestral lineage. Support for the key innovation hypothesis is scarce. however. even in textbook examples of adaptive radiation. Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) have been proposed as putative key innovation for the adaptive radiation of notothenioid fishes in the ice-cold waters of Antarctica. A crucial prerequisite for this assumption is the concurrence of the notothenioid radiation with the onset of Antarctic sea ice conditions. Here. we use a fossil-calibrated multi-marker phylogeny of nothothenioid and related acanthomorph fishes to date AFGP emergence and the notothenioid radiation. All time-constraints are cross-validated to assess their reliability resulting in six powerful calibration points. We find that the notothenioid radiation began near the Oligocene-Miocene transition. which coincides with the increasing presence of Antarctic sea ice. Divergence dates of notothenioids are thus consistent with the key innovation hypothesis of AFGP. Early notothenioid divergences are furthermore congruent with vicariant speciation and the breakup of Gondwana.,True,yyZkp90AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,116,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018911,18080440971843456816,/scholar?cites=18080440971843456816,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018911,0,0,0

However. no clear synapomorphies among the three large flatworm taxa - the Catenulida. the Acoelomorpha and the Rhabditophora - have been characterized to date. Molecular phylogenies. on the other hand. commonly positioned acoels separate from other flatworms. Accordingly. our own multi-locus phylogenetic analysis using 43 genes and 23 animal species places the acoel flatworm Isodiametra pulchra at the base of all Bilateria. distant from other flatworms. By contrast. novel data on the distribution and proliferation of stem cells and the specific mode of epidermal replacement constitute a strong synapomorphy for the Acoela plus the major group of flatworms. the Rhabditophora. The expression of a piwi-like gene not only in gonadal. but also in adult somatic stem cells is another unique feature among bilaterians. These two independent stem-cell-related characters put the Acoela into the Platyhelminthes-Lophotrochozoa clade and account for the most parsimonious evolutionary explanation of epidermal cell renewal in the Bilateria. Most available multigene analyses produce conflicting results regarding the position of the acoels in the tree of life. Given these phylogenomic conflicts and the contradiction of developmental and morphological data with phylogenomic results. the monophyly of the phylum Platyhelminthes and the position of the Acoela remain unresolved.

Several species are known to be involved in crop damage and in the epidemiology of several human and cattle diseases. Due to the existence of sibling species their identification is often problematic. Thus an easy. fast and accurate species identification tool is needed for non-systematicians to correctly identify Praomyini species. In this study we compare the usefulness of three genes (16S. Cytb. CO1) for identifying species of this tribe. A total of 426 specimens representing 40 species (sampled across their geographical range) were sequenced for the three genes. Nearly all of the species included in our study are monophyletic in the neighbour joining trees. The degree of intra-specific variability tends to be lower than the divergence between species. but no barcoding gap is detected. The success rate of the statistical methods of species identification is excellent (up to 99% or 100% for statistical supervised classification methods as the k-Nearest Neighbour or Random Forest). The 16S gene is 2.5 less variable than the Cytb and CO1 genes. As a result its discriminatory power is smaller. To sum up. our results suggest that using DNA markers for identifying species in the Praomyini tribe is a largely valid approach. and that the CO1 and Cytb genes are better DNA markers than the 16S gene.

We compared the efficiency of three types of traps for sampling small mammals in an African rainforest: one type of interception trap (pitfall traps with drift fences) and two types of baited traps (Sherman live trap and metal snap trap). We captured 1884 individuals belonging to 9 shrew and 11 murid rodent species. Pitfall traps were more efficient (higher number of species trapped and higher trap success) than baited traps for capturing shrews. In contrast. they were less efficient for capturing rodents. even if some rare species were captured in pitfall traps only. Sherman and snap traps have complementary qualities for the capture of rodents. Sherman traps are more effective for trapping smaller rodent species. while snap traps tend to be more effective for trapping larger ones. Moreover. light individuals of the largest species are better captured than heavy ones in Sherman. while no significant difference was observed for small species. No sex ratio difference was detected between populations sampled by each of the three types of traps. The three types of traps used in this study have complementary effects onto the capture of small mammals in African rainforest. An assortment of traps should always be employed in studies of small mammal communities in African rainforest in order to obtain a wider range of taxa. and thus a better representation of the community.,True,wu9o6g0AAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC,65,http://biblio.naturalsciences.be/associated_publications/bjz/136-1/volume-136-1-pp-107-111.pdf,16866414074169247647,/scholar?cites=16866414074169247647,,http://biblio.naturalsciences.be/associated_publications/bjz/136-1/volume-136-1-pp-107-111.pdf,0,0,0

Both genes proved to be suitable molecular markers for diagnosis of Hylomyscus species. Nevertheless the resolving powers of these two genes differ. and with both markers (either analyzed singly or in combination). some nodes remain unresolved. This is probably related to the fact that the species emerged during a rapid diversification event that occurred 2–6 Myr ago (4–5 Myr ago for most divergence events).

Lophuromys (four) and Deomys (one) are among the most common Muridae in the Kisangani region. To establish whether or not rivers constitute dispersal barriers for these rodents. we investigated the presence of these genera and their species in eight localities that are either separated by the Congo River or its tributaries. A total of 42.466 trapping nights resulted in the collection of 1185 Praomys. 233 Lophuromys and 209 Deomys ferrugineus. We observed that in almost all cases the studied species appear to have restricted distribution ranges. and that it is likely that the importance of the rivers as a barrier differs for the studied species. For example. P. misonnei was only collected from the right bank of the Congo. while P. lukolelae appears to be restricted to the left bank. In contrast. Praomys identified as P. mutoni or as members of the P. jacksoni species complex are collected on both sides of the Congo River. In contrast. all Lophuromys species were collected in a limited number of sampling sites only. L. dudui and L. luteogaster were only collected along the right bank of the Congo River. and the latter species appears to be restricted to the right bank of the Lindi River.

Konink. Belg. Inst.

Multivariate analyses of the craniometrical data of our specimens and comparisons with the type specimens. demonstrate that Lophuromys brevicaudus and L. chrysopus are to be considered valid species both endemic to Ethiopia; moreover these two species can be distinguished on pelage colour and external characters. The former is a specialized heathland form confined to Chilalo. Gedeb and Bale Mountains (eastern plateau) covering a range of altitudes (2.400 m to 3.750 m ASL). the latter is widespread in lower tropical forests (I. 680 to 2.760 m ASL) on both sides of the Rift Valley. There are indications that L. cluysopus has differentiated into two distinct subspecies on either side of the Rift. The question on L. jlavopunctatus sensu stricto is raised; the 68-chromosomal form from the Beletta Forest (western plateau) is conditionally assigned to be L. jlavopunctatus brunneus. The occurrence in the same area of a fourth species. Lophuromys sp. D is a possibility.

Although we initially limited our study area to central and eastern Africa. we were forced to include specimens for comparison from other areas. including western Africa. Angola and Zimbabwe-Zambia. This revision was realized using craniometric data of nearly 1000 skulls grouped in 20 operational taxonomical units (OTU's) mainly occurring in the central and eastern part of the African continent. The observation that differences in age and sex composition of the OTU's are of no or little consequence for the branching of the obtained phenetic trees. allowed us to undertake the screening of the genus Dasymys of the central and eastern African region. This approach enabled us to evaluate already described taxa. to select a neotype for D. nudipes and to describe three new taxa. Subsequent genetic analysis (cytochrome b) allowed us to provide a genetical characterization of two of the new species and several other taxa. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the genus Dasymys originated in the west African forest block betore spreading in a first step to the forest of the central African region and then in a second step to the savannahs of southern. eastern and possibly also western Africa.,True,f6Wu85UAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,15,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01346074/,16685020013404668976,/scholar?cites=16685020013404668976,,,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The ontogeny of the bony skull of the African catfish. Clarias gariepinus. is studied from initial ossification until a complete skull is formed. The ossification sequence in C. gariepinus seems to be related to the functional demands that arise in a developing larva. Early ossification of the opercular bone coincides with the initiation of opercular skin movements. Early ossifications involve several dentulous bones. formed shortly before the transition phase from endogenous to exogenous feeding. The enlarging branchiostegal membrane becomes supported by the gradual adding of branchiostegal rays. Parasphenoid ossification may be related to protection of the brain during prey transport. whereas the several hyoid bones. including the parurohyal. are formed in relation to the increasing loads exerted onto the tendons of the sternohyoideus and consequently onto the hyoid bar.

Although initially useful for visualizing mineralized tissues. recent developments are promising for studying soft tissues as well. Especially for micro-CT scanning. several X-ray contrast enhancers are performant in sufficiently contrasting soft tissue organ systems by a different attenuation strength of X-rays. Overall visualization of soft tissue organs has proven to be possible. although the tissue-specific capacities of these enhancers remain unclear. In this study. we tested several contrast agents for their usefulness to discriminate between tissue types and organs. using three model organisms (mouse. zebrafish and Xenopus). Specimens were stained with osmium tetroxide (OsO4). phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) and phosphotungstic acid (PTA). and were scanned using high resolution microtomography. The contrasting potentials between tissue types and organs are described based on volume renderings and virtual sections. In general. PTA and PMA appeared to allow better discrimination. Especially epithelial structures. cell-dense brain regions. liver. lung and blood could be easily distinguished. The PMA yielded the best results. allowing discrimination even at the level of cell layers.

A significant higher proportion of C. gariepinus larvae with deformed notochord and pericardial edema was detected at 2.5 mg/l malathion and higher. The results suggested that (1) deformed notochord was the result of the uncontrolled contractions of the body musculature due to malathion toxicity and (2) the vertebral deformities observed in the fish which have been exposed to malathion from the notochord-stage onwards were the result of a deformed notochord instead of the deformation of the vertebral elements themselves.,True,mTwvoyIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,77,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653597002087,18290479428349647169,/scholar?cites=18290479428349647169,,,0,0,0

Subspecific taxa in this group are currently based on wing spot size in <S 6. Here. the variation in wing shape and size is evaluated. to test whether shape is different at a population level. and whether this has implications at a taxonomic level. It was found that Geometric Morphometries successfully discriminates populations: overall wing shape significantly differed between populations but the results were only partly compatible with taxonomic studies based on wing spot size. Irrespective of wing spot. all populations showed differentiation in wing shape even though not in wing size; 4 groups were recognized based on wing shape: (1) Turkish! population; (2) Spanish. Finnish. Russian and Turkish2 populations; (3) Italian. German and French populations; (4) Greek and Albanian populations. Ordination of the populations based on consensus data and cluster analysis phenogram confirmed such a pattern. The Spanish population (C. xanthostoma). did not show a strong identity. while the Turkish 1 (C. s. waterstoni) was quite isolated.

1096359,Why the seahorse tail is square,2015,Michael M Porter and Dominique Adriaens and Ross L Hatton and Marc A Meyers and Joanna McKittrick,349,Science,6243,,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Although the predominant shapes of most animal tails are cylindrical. seahorse tails are square prisms. The skeleton of their tails consists of a bony armor arranged into several ringlike segments composed of four L-shaped plates that surround a central vertebra. These plates articulate with specialized joints that facilitate bending and twisting. as well as resist vertebral fracture from crushing. Muscles attached to the vertebral column transmit forces to the bony plates to provide motion for grasping and holding on to objects such as sea grasses. mangrove roots. and coral reefs. which allows them to hide and rely on camouflage when evading predators and capturing prey.We hypothesize that the square cross-sectional architecture of a seahorse tail improves mechanical performance in prehension (grasping ability) and armored functions (crushing resistance). relative to a cylindrical one …,True,mTwvoyIAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C,65,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6243/aaa6683.abstract,8429907174106708298,/scholar?cites=8429907174106708298,,http://courses.washington.edu/biomechs/homework/Seahorse.pdf,0,0,0

From a mechanical perspective. however. beak size and shape are only indirectly related to birds' abilities to crack seeds. and beak form is hypothesized to evolve mainly under selection for fracture avoidance. Here. we test the fracture-avoidance hypothesis using finite-element modelling.

Adult seahorses are known to capture prey by rotating their long-snouted head extremely quickly towards prey. followed by powerful suction. This type of suction is powered by elastic recoil and requires very precise coordination of the movements of the associated feeding structures. making it an all-or-none phenomenon. Here. we show that newborn Hippocampus reidi are able to successfully feed using an extremely rapid and powerful snout rotation combined with a high-volume suction. surpassing that observed in adult seahorses. An inverse dynamic analysis shows that an elastic recoil mechanism is also used to power head rotation in newborn H. reidi.

A detailed study integrating bones. muscles and ligaments was performed on Ancistrus cf. triradiatus. using cleared and stained specimens. dissections and manipulations on fresh specimens. serial sections. and histological examination of key tissues. A limited kinematic study using high-speed video was performed as well.The suspensorium is a rather rigid structure; the hyoid is more movable and associated muscles are more substantial; it appears to be more important in the buccal pump system. The transverse orientation of the hyohyoideus abductor suggests it can’t open the branchiostegal membrane. This movement might be passive. Apart from divisions inserting on the lower and upper jaws. a medial adductor mandibulae division. the retractor veli. inserts on the oral valve. The retractor tentaculi1 and the lateral part of the completely subdivided extensor tentaculi move the maxillary barbel. a structure that allows controlled inspiration preventing failing of the suction system. Rotational movements of the lower and upper jaws result in scraping the substrate.

1096375,No trade-off between biting and suction feeding performance in clariid catfishes,2007,Sam Van Wassenbergh and Anthony Herrel and Dominique Adriaens and Peter Aerts,210,Journal of Experimental Biology,1,27-36,The Company of Biologists Ltd,It is generally assumed that biting performance trades off with suction performance in fish because both feeding types may place conflicting demands on the cranial musculo-skeletal system. However. the functional consequences of morphological adaptations enhancing biting on the mechanics and performance of suction feeding in fish remain obscure. In this study. suction feeding performance was compared between three clariid catfish species differing considerably in their biting capacity. by measuring the velocity of a standardized prey being sucked into the buccal cavity using high-speed cineradiography. In addition. buccal volume changes during prey capture were quantified by ellipse modelling. As all species were able to accelerate the prey to similar peak velocities. our results demonstrate the possibility for catfishes to increase bite performance considerably without compromising suction performance …,True,mTwvoyIAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,41,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/1/27.short,11437190777530523134,/scholar?cites=11437190777530523134,,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/210/1/27.full.pdf,0,0,0

A generalised cranial lateral-line pattern is present (supraorbital. infraorbital. preoperculo-mandibular. otic. postotic and temporal canals). The supratemporal commissure. however. is missing. although a supraorbital commissure is present (formed through the fusion of the epiphysial branches). In addition to canals. some pit-lines are present which cover both canal regions and non-canal regions (vertical. horizontal. oral. anterior. middle and posterior pit-lines). In this paper. several ontogenetic stages of the canal related bones in C. gariepinus were studied. A description of the canal bones. as well as some considerations concerning their nomenclature are given. All canal bones develop. whereas the parietal bone seems to have fused with the supraoccipital bone during ontogeny. as has been observed in some siluroids. The extrascapulars (= supratemporals) are missing in C. gariepinus. as is the case in many siluroids. The posttemporal and supracleithral bones have fused as well. Surprisingly. some separate splenial bones. enclosing the distal part of the mandibular canal are present. Some secondary modifications indicate the apomorphic features of the Clariidae.

Temperature compensation mechanisms have been reported. which enable organisms to minimize some of the temperature related effects. To investigate this process. zebrafish (Danio rerio) were acclimated to a control (26 °C). an increased (34 °C) or a decreased (18 °C) temperature for 4. 14 and 28 days. In general. warm acclimation depleted energy stores and decreased the condition factor. while cold acclimation increased both. The energy parameters as well as the transcriptional responses (investigated using printed 15k microarrays and real time PCR) indicated that warm acclimation was particularly stressful. However. after 28 days of warm acclimation. energy stores had recovered from the initial depletion.

Currently neurotoxicity assessment is mostly performed to predict and prevent harm to human populations. Despite all the efforts invested in the last years in developing novel in vitro or in silico test systems. in vivo tests with rodents are still the only accepted test for neurotoxicity risk assessment in Europe. Despite an increasing number of reports of species showing altered behaviour. neurotoxicity assessment for species in the environment is not required and therefore mostly not performed. Considering the increasing numbers of environmental contaminants with potential neurotoxic potential. eco-neurotoxicity should be also considered in risk assessment. In order to do so novel test systems are needed that can cope with species differences within ecosystems. In the field. online-biomonitoring systems using behavioural information could be used to detect neurotoxic effects and effect-directed analyses could be applied to identify the neurotoxicants causing the effect. Additionally. toxic pressure calculations in combination with mixture modelling could use environmental chemical monitoring data to predict adverse effects and prioritize pollutants for laboratory testing. Cheminformatics based on computational toxicological data from in vitro and in vivo studies could help to identify potential neurotoxicants. An array of in vitro assays covering different modes of action could be applied to screen compounds for neurotoxicity.

Nevertheless. the exact mode of action and its resulting toxicological effects in aquatic organisms remain largely unknown. To gain a better understanding of the mode of action of teleost PFOA toxicity. transcriptomics. proteomics. biochemical parameters and reproduction were integrated in this study. Male and female zebrafish were exposed to nominal concentrations of 0.1. 0.5 and 1 mg L−1 PFOA for 4 and 28 d resulting in PFOA accumulation which was higher in males than in females. These gender-related differences were likely caused by different elimination rates due to distinct hormone levels and differences in transport activity by solute carriers.

The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework forms a basis for the development of new non-animal test methods. It also provides biological context for mechanistic information from existing assays. However. a single AOP may not capture all events that contribute to any relevant toxic effect. even in single chemical exposure scenarios. AOP networks. defined as sets of AOPs sharing at least one common element. are capable of more realistically representing potential chemical effects. They provide information on interactions between AOPs and have the potential to reveal previously unknown links between biological pathways.

Gudgeon (Gobio gobio). roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) were captured at 6 sampling sites along a cadmium and zinc gradient and one reference site in a tributary of the Scheldt River in Flanders (Belgium). At each site up to 10 individuals per species were collected and analyzed on their general condition factor (K). hepatosomatic index (HSI) and gonadosomatic index (GSI). From each individual fish the liver was dissected and analyzed on Cd. Cu and Zn and MT-content. Although not all species were present at each site. hepatic Cd and Zn levels generally followed the pollution gradient and highest levels were measured in perch. followed by roach and gudgeon. Nevertheless also an effect of site was observed on this order. MT-levels appeared to be the highest in gudgeon although differences with the other species were not very pronounced and depended on the site. Significant relationships were found between hepatic zinc accumulation and MT levels. For each species the ratio MTtheoretical/ MTmeasured was calculated. which gives an indication of the relative capacity to induce MTs and thus immobilize the metals.

This process is also suitable for studying the geometrical properties of the hadronic final state at hadron colliders. This requires a next-to-leading order prediction of the three-jet observables. In this paper we describe the theoretical formalism of such a calculation with sufficient detail.

Lachesis muta. These large vipers are widely distributed in lowland tropical forests in Central and South America. where three of four allopatric subspecies are separated by montane barriers. Our phylogeny indicates that the four subspecies belong to two clades. the Central American and South American lineages. We use published molecular studies of other taxa to estimate a ‘reptilian mtDNA rate’ and thus temporal boundaries for major lineage divergences in Lachesis. We estimate that the Central and South American forms diverged 18-6 Mya. perhaps due to the uplifting of the Andes. whereas the two Central American subspecies may have diverged 11-4 Mya with the uprising of the Cordillera de Talamanca that separates them today.

Using a newly developed set of reptile-specific primers for COI we present the first comprehensive study targeting the entire reptile fauna of the fourth-largest island in the world. the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar.   Methodology/Principal Findings Representatives of the majority of Madagascan non-avian reptile species (including Squamata and Testudines) were sampled and successfully DNA barcoded. The new primer pair achieved a constantly high success rate (72.7–100%) for most squamates. More than 250 species of reptiles (out of the 393 described ones; representing around 64% of the known diversity of species) were barcoded. The average interspecific genetic distance within families ranged from a low of 13.4% in the Boidae to a high of 29.8% in the Gekkonidae. Using the average genetic divergence between sister species as a threshold. 41–48 new candidate (undescribed) species were identified. Simulations were used to evaluate the performance of DNA barcoding as a function of completeness of taxon sampling and fragment length. Compared with available multi-gene phylogenies. DNA barcoding correctly assigned most samples to species. genus and family with high confidence and the analysis of fewer taxa resulted in an increased number of well supported lineages. Shorter marker-lengths generally decreased the number of well supported nodes. but even mini-barcodes of 100 bp correctly assigned many samples to genus and family.

Ultrastructural tracer studies indicate that extravasation of macromolecules takes place primarily in segments of large penetrating cortical blood vessels. The purpose of the present study was to examine fracture faces of cerebral endothelium in normal and hyperosmolar mannitol-treated rat brains in an attempt to elucidate:(a) the organization of endothelial cell junctions in various segments of the cerebral vascular bed and (b) the structural basis of blood-brain barrier opening in hyperosmotic conditions. We found that in control rat brains:(a) capillary endothelium is provided with complex networks of continuous multistranded tight junctions;(b) continuous capillary-type tight junctions extend. although in a simpler beltlike fashion. into the endothelium of postcapillary venules;(c) the endothelium of collecting veins possess widely discontinuous single-or double-stranded tight junctions associated with gap junctions;(d) arteries have endothelial tight junctions containing focal discontinuities associated with gap junctions. In hyperosmolar mannitol-treated rat brains. there appeared focal distensions of compartments but no definitive structural discontinuities in capillary-type tight junctions.

Nothobranchius furzeri is an annual fish from south-eastern Africa. inhabiting discrete temporary savannah pools outside main river alluvia. Their dispersal is limited and population processes affecting its genetic structure are likely a combination of those affecting terrestrial and aquatic taxa. N. furzeri is a model taxon in ageing research and several populations of known geographical origin are used in laboratory studies. Here. we analysed the genetic structure. diversity. historical demography and temporal patterns of divergence in natural populations of N. furzeri across its entire distribution range. Genetic structure and historical demography of N. furzeri were analysed using a combination of mitochondrial (partial cytochrome b sequences. 687 bp) and nuclear (13 microsatellites) markers in 693 fish from 36 populations. Genetic markers consistently demonstrated strong population structuring and suggested two main genetic groups associated with river basins. The split was dated to the Pliocene (>2 Mya). The northern group inhabits savannah pools across the basin of the intermittent river Chefu in south-western Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe.

On the other hand. the role and the type of selection processes shaping the evolution of innate-immunity genes are currently far less clear. In this study we analysed the natural variation and the evolutionary processes acting on two genes involved in the innate-immunity recognition of Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs). We sequenced genes encoding Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) and 7 (Tlr7). two of the key bacterial- and viral-sensing receptors of innate immunity. across 23 species within the subfamily Murinae. Although we have shown that the phylogeny of both Tlr genes is largely congruent with the phylogeny of rodents based on a comparably sized non-immune sequence dataset. we also identified several potentially important discrepancies. The sequence analyses revealed that major parts of both Tlrs are evolving under strong purifying selection. likely due to functional constraints. Yet. also several signatures of positive selection have been found in both genes. with more intense signal in the bacterial-sensing Tlr4 than in the viral-sensing Tlr7. 92% and 100% of sites evolving under positive selection in Tlr4 and Tlr7. respectively. were located in the extracellular domain.

Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus. belong among the most common bat species in Europe. it is still unclear whether they can migrate over long distances between summer and winter roosts. Long-distance migratory species may be expected to show low levels of genetic structuring in large areas due to regular mixing of the gene pool by mating that occurs during migration and/or hibernation. Conversely. the dispersal of gametes in sedentary species is spatially restricted. populations are more genetically structured. and isolation by relatively short distance is visible. By analysing diversity of highly variable microsatellites within and among summer colonies of both studied species in central Europe. we found that differentiation between populations is very weak.

Burrowing (fossorial) mammals construct or visit existing burrow systems regularly or temporarily for shelter but search for their food mainly above ground. Subterraneanmammals confine their existence and foraging mainly to the underground ecotope. and there is a continuum from fossorial through facultative to strictly subterranean lifestyles (cf.. eg Nevo 1979. 1999; Nevo and Reig 1990; Kinlaw 1999 for reviews). The shelter function of the underground ecotope has two components: protection from predators and protection from environmental fluctuation or extremes predominating above the ground. Protection is particularly important in periods of enhanced vulnerability: during resting and sleeping. hibernation. aestivation. or breeding.

Rodentia) contain several social. cooperatively breeding species with low extrinsic mortality and unusually high longevity. All social bathyergids live in multigenerational families where reproduction is skewed towards a few breeding individuals. Most of their offspring remain as reproductively inactive “helpers” in their natal families. often for several years. This “reproductive subdivision” of mole-rat societies might be of interest for ageing research. as in at least one social bathyergid (Ansell's mole-rats Fukomys anselli). breeders have been shown to age significantly slower than non-breeders. These animals thus provide excellent conditions for studying the epigenetics of senescence by comparing divergent longevities within the same genotypes without the inescapable short-comings of inter-species comparisons. It has been claimed that many if not all social mole-rat species may have evolved similar ageing patterns. too. However. this remains unclear on account of the scarcity of reliable datasets on the subject. We therefore analyzed a 20-year breeding record of Giant mole-rats Fukomys mechowii. another social bathyergid species. We found that breeders indeed lived significantly longer than helpers (ca. 1.5–2.2fold depending on the sex). irrespective of social rank or other potentially confounding factors.

1096523,Light perception in two strictly subterranean rodents: life in the dark or blue?,2010,Ondřej Kott and Radim Šumbera and Pavel Němec,5,PLoS One,7,e11810,Public Library of Science,Background The African mole-rats (Bathyergidae. Rodentia) are strictly subterranean. congenitally microphthalmic rodents that are hardly ever exposed to environmental light. Because of the lack of an overt behavioural reaction to light. they have long been considered to be blind. However. recent anatomical studies have suggested retention of basic visual capabilities. In this study. we employed behavioural tests to find out if two mole-rat species are able to discriminate between light and dark. if they are able to discriminate colours and. finally. if the presence of light in burrows provokes plugging behaviour. which is assumed to have a primarily anti-predatory function.  Methodology/Principal Finding We used a binary choice test to show that the silvery mole-rat Heliophobius argenteocinereus and the giant mole-rat Fukomys mechowii exhibit a clear photoavoidance response to full-spectrum (“white”). blue and green-yellow light. but no significant reaction to ultraviolet or red light during nest building. The mole-rats thus retain dark/light discrimination capabilities and a capacity to perceive short to medium-wavelength light in the photopic range of intensities. These findings further suggest that the mole-rat S opsin has its absorption maximum in the violet/blue part of the spectrum. The assay did not yield conclusive evidence regarding colour discrimination. To test the putative role of vision in bathyergid anti-predatory behaviour. we examined the reaction of mole-rats to the incidence of light in an artificial burrow system. The presence of light in the burrow effectively induced plugging of the illuminated tunnel.

In Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies. adaptations to local ecological conditions can promote speciation. which was recently supposed to occur even in sympatry at sites where two soil types of contrasting characteristics abut each other. Quantitative description of ecological conditions in such a site has been. nevertheless. missing. We measured characteristics of food supply and soil within 16 home ranges of blind mole rats Spalax galili in an area subdivided into two parts formed by basaltic soil and pale rendzina. We also mapped nine complete mole rat burrow systems to compare burrowing patterns between the soil types. Basaltic soil had a higher food supply and was harder than rendzina even under higher moisture content and lower bulk density. Population density of mole rats was five-times lower in rendzina. possibly due to the lower food supply and higher cover of Sarcopoterium shrubs which seem to be avoided by mole rats.

Rodentia). knowledge is lacking about their behaviour under natural conditions. We studied activity of the largest social bathyergid. the giant mole-rat Fukomys mechowii. in its natural habitat in Zambia using radio-telemetry. We radio-tracked six individuals during three continuous 72-h sessions. Five of these individuals. including a breeding male. belonged to a single family group; the remaining female was probably a solitary disperser. The non-breeders of the family were active (i.e. outside the nest) 5.8 hours per 24h-day with the activity split into 6.5 short bouts. The activity was more concentrated in the night hours. when the animals also travelled longer distances from the nest. The breeding male spent only 3.2 hours per day outside the nest. utilizing less than 20% of the whole family home range. The dispersing female displayed a much different activity pattern than the family members. Her 8.0 hours of outside-nest activity per day were split into 4.6 bouts which were twice as long as in the family non-breeders. Her activity peak in the late afternoon coincided with the temperature maximum in the depth of 10 cm (roughly the depth of the foraging tunnels). Our results suggest that the breeding individuals (at least males) contribute very little to the work of the family group. Nevertheless. the amount of an individual's activity and its daily pattern are probably flexible in this species and can be modified in response to actual environmental and social conditions.,True,ZWyz0EAAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,31,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055357,10850999289957808193,/scholar?cites=10850999289957808193,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055357,0,0,0

Rodentia) exhibit a wide range of social structures. from solitary to eusocial. We previously found a lack of sex differences in the external genitalia and morphology of the perineal muscles associated with the phallus in the eusocial naked mole-rat. This was quite surprising. as the external genitalia and perineal muscles are sexually dimorphic in all other mammals examined. We hypothesized that the lack of sex differences in naked mole-rats might be related to their unusual social structure.  Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the genitalia and perineal muscles in three African mole-rat species: the naked mole-rat. the solitary silvery mole-rat. and the Damaraland mole-rat. a species considered to be eusocial. but with less reproductive skew than naked mole-rats. Our findings support a relationship between social structure. mating system. and sexual differentiation. Naked mole-rats lack sex differences in genitalia and perineal morphology. silvery mole-rats exhibit sex differences. and Damaraland mole-rats are intermediate.

Emlen. Ricklefs. and Wingfield. 1989; Catchpole and Slater. 1995). The impetus of bird song has been important in at least three different areas. First. studies of the development of bird song have made clear that behavior patterns cannot just be labeled as “innate” or “learned” but arise through an intricate interplay between the two (Johnston. 1988; Slater. 1989; Catchpole and Slater. 1995). Second. ever since Darwin (1871) proposed the theory of sexual selection to explain the evolution of elaborate mating displays that differ between the sexes. empirical studies of the role of acoustic signals in the context of reproduction have been important and influential. Bird song and other acoustic signals are probably the sexually selected traits that have been studied the most (Andersson. 1994). Finally. the discovery of neural substrates for song has introduced a new dimension to the study of bird song. making integration of behavioral and neurobiological studies feasible (Nottebohm. Stokes. and Leonard. 1976. Konishi. 1985; Nottebohm. 1993). Research on the vocal centers of the bird brain provides perhaps the best example in which the neural substrates of a complex behavior have been characterized (Catchpole and Slater. 1995; Francis. 1995; Jacobs. 1996).Ideally. to get a good understanding of the function and evolution of the song and song repertoire in a given species. direct interactions and exchange of ideas among those working on these questions are necessary.

During the breeding season courtship song occurs prior to copulation and appears to reflect male sexual arousal. Outside the breeding season starlings sing. but song appears unrelated to reproduction. The aromatization of testosterone (T). likely within the medial preoptic nucleus (POM). is critical for the expression of male sexual arousal. The present study was performed to determine whether seasonal changes in the POM might relate to seasonal changes in courtship singing behavior in male starlings. T concentrations. the volume of the POM. and aromatase within the POM were examined both during and outside of the breeding season in male starlings. Song was also recorded at these times both with and without a female present. The POM was largest and contained dense aromatase immunostaining only during the …,True,nAAsOTsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,165,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X00916234,5446155950190270405,/scholar?cites=5446155950190270405,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45251670/Seasonal_Changes_in_Courtship_Song_and_t20160501-3833-iv6vvz.pdf,0,0,0

We investigated interspecific patterns of circulating testosterone in male birds to test the hypothesis that testosterone plays a crucial role in sexual selection as determined by degree of polygyny and extra-pair paternity. We predicted that the evolution of increased levels of polygyny and extra-pair paternity would have resulted in the evolution of increased levels of testosterone to allow males more efficiently to compete for mates. This hypothesis was tested in comparative analyses of 116 species of birds using Generalized Least Squares Models. We assessed the importance of latitudinal distribution. because this can confound the relationship between testosterone and mating success.

In this study. we experimentally elevated T levels of monogamous males in the facultatively polygynous European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). and compared mate attraction and paternal behaviour of T-treated males with those of controls (C-males). T-males significantly reduced their participation in incubation and fed nestlings significantly less often than C-males. Females paired to T-treated males did not compensate for their mate’s lower paternal effort. The observed reduction in a male’s investment in incubating the eggs was accompanied by an increased investment in typical female-attracting behaviours: T-males spent a significantly higher proportion of their time singing to attract additional females …,True,nAAsOTsAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,160,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002650000266,5695494724839712355,/scholar?cites=5695494724839712355,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcel_Eens/publication/226443493_Experimental_evidence_of_a_testosterone_induced_shift_from_paternal_to_mating_behavior_in_a_facultatively_polygynous_songbird/links/09e4150c737bd7ec02000000.pdf,0,0,0
