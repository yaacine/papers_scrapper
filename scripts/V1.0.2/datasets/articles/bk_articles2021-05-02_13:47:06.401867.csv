It is a leading cause of blindness among working adults. Detection of this condition in the early stage is critical for good prognosis. Present day detection of DR normally requires digital fundus image or images generated using optical coherence tomography (OCT). As OCT are high-priced. diagnosis of DR using fundus image will benefit for the patient and the ophthalmologists. Manual inspection of morphological changes in blood vessels. microaneurysms. exudates. hemorrhages. and macula are time consuming and tedious tasks.

Significant research endeavors have been devoted to aligning the feature distributions between the source and the target domains in the top fully connected layers based on unsupervised DNN-based models. However. the domain adaptation has been arbitrarily constrained near the output ends of the DNN models. which thus brings about inadequate knowledge transfer in DNN-based domain adaptation process. especially near the input end.

1281780,Towards discriminability and diversity: Batch nuclear-norm maximization under label insufficient situations,2020,Shuhao Cui and Shuhui Wang and Junbao Zhuo and Liang Li and Qingming Huang and Qi Tian,,,,3941-3950,,The learning of the deep networks largely relies on the data with human-annotated labels. In some label insufficient situations. the performance degrades on the decision boundary with high data density. A common solution is to directly minimize the Shannon Entropy. but the side effect caused by entropy minimization. ie. reduction of the prediction diversity. is mostly ignored. To address this issue. we reinvestigate the structure of classification output matrix of a randomly selected data batch. We find by theoretical analysis that the prediction discriminability and diversity could be separately measured by the Frobenius-norm and rank of the batch output matrix. Besides. the nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the Frobenius-norm. and a convex approximation of the matrix rank. Accordingly. to improve both discriminability and diversity. we propose Batch Nuclear-norm Maximization (BNM) on the output matrix. BNM could boost the learning under typical label insufficient learning scenarios. such as semi-supervised learning. domain adaptation and open domain recognition. On these tasks. extensive experimental results show that BNM outperforms competitors and works well with existing well-known methods.

1281781,Gradually vanishing bridge for adversarial domain adaptation,2020,Shuhao Cui and Shuhui Wang and Junbao Zhuo and Chi Su and Qingming Huang and Qi Tian,,,,12455-12464,,In unsupervised domain adaptation. rich domain-specific characteristics bring great challenge to learn domain-invariant representations. However. domain discrepancy is considered to be directly minimized in existing solutions. which is difficult to achieve in practice. Some methods alleviate the difficulty by explicitly modeling domain-invariant and domain-specific parts in the representations. but the adverse influence of the explicit construction lies in the residual domain-specific characteristics in the constructed domain-invariant representations. In this paper. we equip adversarial domain adaptation with Gradually Vanishing Bridge (GVB) mechanism on both generator and discriminator. On the generator. GVB could not only reduce the overall transfer difficulty. but also reduce the influence of the residual domain-specific characteristics in domain-invariant representations. On the discriminator. GVB contributes to enhance the discriminating ability. and balance the adversarial training process. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our GVB methods outperform strong competitors. and cooperate well with other adversarial methods.

1281782,Unsupervised open domain recognition by semantic discrepancy minimization,2019,Junbao Zhuo and Shuhui Wang and Shuhao Cui and Qingming Huang,,,,750-759,,We address the unsupervised open domain recognition (UODR) problem. where categories in labeled source domain S is only a subset of those in unlabeled target domain T. The task is to correctly classify all samples in T including known and unknown categories. UODR is challenging due to the domain discrepancy. which becomes even harder to bridge when a large number of unknown categories exist in T. Moreover. the classification rules propagated by graph CNN (GCN) may be distracted by unknown categories and lack generalization capability. To measure the domain discrepancy for asymmetric label space between S and T. we propose Semantic-Guided Matching Discrepancy (SGMD). which first employs instance matching between S and T. and then the discrepancy is measured by a weighted feature distance between matched instances. We further design a limited balance constraint to achieve a more balanced classification output on known and unknown categories. We develop Unsupervised Open Domain Transfer Network (UODTN). which learns both the backbone classification network and GCN jointly by reducing the SGMD. enforcing the limited balance constraint and minimizing the classification loss on S. UODTN better preserves the semantic structure and enforces the consistency between the learned domain invariant visual features and the semantic embeddings.

1281786,TalkNet: Fully-Convolutional Non-Autoregressive Speech Synthesis Model,2020,Stanislav Beliaev and Yurii Rebryk and Boris Ginsburg,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.05514,,,,We propose TalkNet. a convolutional non-autoregressive neural model for speech synthesis. The model consists of two feed-forward convolutional networks. The first network predicts grapheme durations. An input text is expanded by repeating each symbol according to the predicted duration. The second network generates a mel-spectrogram from the expanded text. To train a grapheme duration predictor. we add the grapheme duration to the training dataset using a pre-trained Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based speech recognition model.

1281788,TalkNet 2: Non-Autoregressive Depth-Wise Separable Convolutional Model for Speech Synthesis with Explicit Pitch and Duration Prediction,2021,Stanislav Beliaev and Boris Ginsburg,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.08189,,,,We propose TalkNet. a non-autoregressive convolutional neural model for speech synthesis with explicit pitch and duration prediction. The model consists of three feed-forward convolutional networks. The first network predicts grapheme durations. An input text is expanded by repeating each symbol according to the predicted duration. The second network predicts pitch value for every mel frame. The third network generates a mel-spectrogram from the expanded text conditioned on predicted pitch. All networks are based on 1D depth-wise separable convolutional architecture. The explicit duration prediction eliminates word skipping and repeating. The quality of the generated speech nearly matches the best auto-regressive models - TalkNet trained on the LJSpeech dataset got MOS4.08. The model has only 13.2M parameters. almost 2x less than the present state-of-the-art text-to-speech models. The non-autoregressive architecture allows for fast training and inference - 422x times faster than real-time.

1281791,Using virtual reality to assess ethical decisions in road traffic scenarios: applicability of value-of-life-based models and influences of time pressure,2017,Leon R Sütfeld and Richard Gast and Peter König and Gordon Pipa,11,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,,122,Frontiers,Self-driving cars are posing a new challenge to our ethics. By using algorithms to make decisions in situations where harming humans is possible. probable. or even unavoidable. a self-driving car’s ethical behavior comes pre-defined. Ad hoc decisions are made in milliseconds. but can be based on extensive research and debates. The same algorithms are also likely to be used in millions of cars at a time. increasing the impact of any inherent biases. and increasing the importance of getting it right. Previous research has shown that moral judgment and behavior are highly context-dependent. and comprehensive and nuanced models of the underlying cognitive processes are out of reach to date. Models of ethics for self-driving cars should thus aim to match human decisions made in the same context. We employed immersive virtual reality to assess ethical behavior in simulated road traffic scenarios. and used the collected data to train and evaluate a range of decision models. In the study. participants controlled a virtual car and had to choose which of two given obstacles they would sacrifice in order to spare the other. We randomly sampled obstacles from a variety of inanimate objects. animals and humans. Our model comparison shows that simple models based on one-dimensional value-of-life scales are suited to describe human ethical behavior in these situations. Furthermore. we examined the influence of severe time pressure on the decision-making process. We found that it decreases consistency in the decision patterns. thus providing an argument for algorithmic decision-making in road traffic.

However. none of the alternatives have managed to consistently outperform the rest and there is no unified theory connecting properties of the task and network with properties of activation functions for most efficient training. A possible solution is to have the network learn its preferred activation functions. In this work. we introduce Adaptive Blending Units (ABUs). a trainable linear combination of a set of activation functions. Since ABUs learn the shape. as well as the overall scaling of the activation function. we also analyze the effects of adaptive scaling in common activation functions.

A growing number of publications amass insight into the factors underlying the choices we make in such situations. often using forced-choice paradigms closely linked to the trolley dilemma. The methodology used to address these questions. however. varies widely between studies. ranging from fully immersive virtual reality settings to completely text-based surveys. In this paper we compare virtual reality and text-based assessments. analyzing the effect that different factors in the methodology have on decisions and emotional response of participants. We present two studies. comparing a total of six different conditions varying across three dimensions: The level of abstraction. the use of virtual reality. and time-constraints. Our results show that the moral decisions made in this context are not strongly influenced by the assessment. and the compared methods ultimately appear to measure very similar constructs. Furthermore. we add to the pool of evidence on the underlying factors of moral judgment in traffic dilemmas. both in terms of general preferences. i.e.. features of the particular situation and potential victims. as well as in terms of individual differences between participants. such as their age and gender.,True,nChzGdAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,5,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223108,15449593177473821048,/scholar?cites=15449593177473821048,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223108,0,0,0

We review existing guidelines with respect to their theoretical and practical feasibility. and highlight a number of unsolved issues that need to be addressed in the pursuit of a framework for automated ethics.

The IGMN is capable of learning from data streams in a single-pass by improving its model after analyzing each data point and discarding it thereafter. Nevertheless. it suffers from the scalability point-of-view. due to its asymptotic time complexity of O(NKD3) for N data points. K Gaussian components and D dimensions. rendering it inadequate for high-dimensional data. In this work. we manage to reduce this complexity to O(NKD2) by deriving formulas for working directly with precision matrices instead of covariance matrices.

This problem consists in taking the correct turning decision at a bifurcation after seeing a light signal some time steps before. The recently proposed Echo State Incremental Gaussian Mixture Network (ESIGMN) is used in order to learn the correct behavior after a single scan through a single training example (and its mirrored version) generated by a simple reactive controller. Experiments with different time delays between the signal and the decision point are performed. and the ESIGMN is shown to solve the problem while achieving good performance. This one-shot ability can be useful for online learning in robotics. since the robot can learn with minimum interaction with the environment.,True,-YrXzz4AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,5,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6252697/,8039029616985378023,/scholar?cites=8039029616985378023,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30911415/ijcnn2012-v4.pdf,0,0,0

It is based on strong statistical principles (Gaussian mixture models) and asymptotically converges to the optimal regression surface as more training data arrive. Moreover. IGMN learns instantaneously and incrementally using a single scan over the training data. it can handle the stability-plasticity dilemma and does not suffer from catastrophic interference. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate the suitability of IGMN in on-line and critical control applications such as incremental concept formation and robotic tasks. Through several experiments. described in this paper. it is shown that IGMN is a very useful machine learning tool for this kind of tasks.

For shape completion. a deep neural network is trained to take a partial view of the object as input and outputs the completed shape as a voxel grid. The key part of the network is dropout layers which are enabled not only during training but also at run-time to generate a set of shape samples representing the shape uncertainty through Monte Carlo sampling. Given the set of shape completed objects. we generate grasp candidates on the mean object shape but evaluate them based on their joint performance in terms of analytical grasp metrics on all the shape candidates. We experimentally validate and benchmark our method against another state-of-the-art method with a Barrett hand on 90000 grasps in simulation and 200 grasps on a real Franka Emika Panda. All experimental results show statistically significant improvements both in terms of grasp quality metrics and grasp success rate. demonstrating that planning shape-uncertainty-aware grasps brings significant advantages over solely planning on a single shape estimate. especially when dealing with complex or unknown objects.,True,3DDM3_kAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,19,https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00645,11791862595516615220,/scholar?cites=11791862595516615220,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00645,0,0,0

1281825,Fast superpixel-based hierarchical approach to image segmentation,2015,Francesco Verdoja and Marco Grangetto,,,,364-374,Springer. Cham,Image segmentation is one of the core task in image processing. Traditionally such operation is performed starting from single pixels requiring a significant amount of computations. It has been shown that superpixels can be used to improve segmentation performance. In this work we propose a novel superpixel-based hierarchical approach for image segmentation that works by iteratively merging nodes of a weighted undirected graph initialized with the superpixels regions. Proper metrics to drive the regions merging are proposed and experimentally validated using the standard Berkeley Dataset. Our analysis shows that the proposed algorithm runs faster than state of the art techniques while providing accurate segmentation results both in terms of visual and objective metrics.,True,3DDM3_kAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,9,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-23231-7_33,12623224453588718416,/scholar?cites=12623224453588718416,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-23231-7_33.pdf,0,0,0

These sensors. however. cannot detect transparent surfaces or measure the full occupancy of complex objects such as tables. Deep Neural Networks have recently been proposed to overcome this limitation by learning to estimate object occupancy. These estimates are nevertheless subject to uncertainty. making the evaluation of their confidence an important issue for these measures to be useful for autonomous navigation and mapping. In this work we approach the problem from two sides. First we discuss uncertainty estimation in deep models. proposing a solution based on a fully convolutional neural network. The proposed architecture is not restricted by the assumption that the uncertainty follows a Gaussian model. as in the case of many popular solutions for deep model uncertainty estimation. such as Monte …,True,3DDM3_kAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,8,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9035016/,7578344619426573510,/scholar?cites=7578344619426573510,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04891,0,0,0

However. those sensors are unable to correctly provide distance to obstacles such as glass panels and tables whose actual occupancy is invisible at the height the sensor is measuring. In this work. instead of estimating the distance to obstacles from richer sensor readings such as 3D lasers or RGBD sensors. we present a method to estimate the distance directly from raw 2D laser data. To learn a mapping from raw 2D laser distances to obstacle distances we frame the problem as a learning task and train a neural network formed as an autoencoder. A novel configuration of network hyperparameters is proposed for the task at hand and is quantitatively validated on a test set. Finally. we qualitatively demonstrate in real time on a Care-O-bot 4 that the trained network can successfully infer obstacle distances from partial 2D laser …,True,3DDM3_kAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,8,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8594399/,8164077307501896052,/scholar?cites=8164077307501896052,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12338,0,0,0

Graph transform gets closer to the optimal KLT by using weights that represent inter-pixel correlations but the extra cost to provide such weights can overwhelm the gain. especially in the case of natural images rich of details. In this paper we provide a novel idea to make graph transform adaptive to the actual image content. avoiding the need to encode the graph weights as side information. We show that an approach similar to spatial prediction can be used to effectively predict graph weights in place of pixels; in particular. we propose the design of directional graph weight prediction modes and show the resulting coding gain.

Cham,In this paper we explore the problem of fitting a 3D morphable model to single face images using only sparse geometric features (edges and landmark points). Previous approaches to this problem are based on nonlinear optimisation of an edge-derived cost that can be viewed as forming soft correspondences between model and image edges. We propose a novel approach. that explicitly computes hard correspondences. The resulting objective function is non-convex but we show that a good initialisation can be obtained efficiently using alternating linear least squares in a manner similar to the iterated closest point algorithm.

The trained localisation part of the network is independently useful since it learns to fit a 3D morphable model to a single image.

While it is clear that 3D reconstruction from 2D points is highly ambiguous if no further constraints are enforced. one might expect that the face-space constraint solves this problem. We show that this is not the case and that geometric information is an ambiguous cue. There are two sources for this ambiguity. The first is that. within the space of 3D face shapes. there are flexibility modes that remain when some parts of the face are fixed. The second occurs only under perspective projection and is a result of perspective transformation as camera distance varies. Two different faces. when viewed at different distances. can give rise to the same 2D geometry.

Transformers usher in a new era. In this paper. we explore three major Transformer-based models. namely GPT. BERT. and XLNet. that carry significant implications for the field.

We call this a Statistical Transformer Network (StaTN). By training a network containing a StaTN end-to-end for a particular task. the network learns the optimal nonrigid alignment of the input data for the task. Moreover. the statistical shape model is learnt with no direct supervision (such as landmarks) and can be reused for other tasks. Besides training for a specific task. we also show that a StaTN can learn a shape model using generic loss functions. This includes a loss inspired by the minimum description length principle in which an appearance model is also learnt from scratch.

Therefore. a new methodology is detailed herein to quantify new car fleet fuel consumption based on vehicle design metrics. The New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) is shown to underestimate on-road fuel consumption in Spark (SI) and Compression Ignition (CI) vehicles by an average of 16% and 13%. respectively. A Bayesian fuel consumption model attributes these discrepancies to differences in rolling. frictional and aerodynamic resistances.

The objectives are to reduce individually absolute energy use and associated emissions of CO2. NOx and PM2.5. This work combines a top down. diversity-led approach to fleet composition with bottom-up models of 23 powertrain variants across nine vehicle segments. Changing the annual distance travelled only led to the smallest change in fleet composition because driving less mitigated the need to shift to smaller vehicles or more efficient powertrains. Instead. managing activity led to a ‘re-petrolisation’ of the fleet which yielded the largest reductions in emissions of NOx and PM2.5.

We present a new methodology using vehicle and powertrain parameters within a Bayesian framework to determine the impact of engineering vehicle improvements on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

1281849,Forecasting Passenger Fleet Fuel Consumption–A New Methodology to Include Uncertainty Analysis,2015,Niall PD Martin and Justin DK Bishop and Ruchi Choudhary and Adam M Boies,,,15-4186,,,The UK’s light duty vehicle fleet is the largest end user of refined petroleum. accounting for 12.5% of national UK CO₂ emissions in 2010. Despite this. current fleet turnover and fuel consumption models do not account for advances in engine technologies. and are unable to account for uncertainties when used to forecast future fleet fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions. This paper introduces a methodology for determining new car fleet fuel consumption based on vehicle design metrics. and accounts for uncertainties inherent in such predictions using a Bayesian statistical framework. Sources of uncertainty are also listed and quantified. while the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) shown to underestimate on-road fuel consumption in Spark (SI) and Compression Ignition (CI) vehicles by 14% and 17%. respectively. A Bayesian fuel consumption model attributes these discrepancies to the NEDC’s misrepresentation of rolling. frictional and aerodynamic resistances. while on-road fuel consumption estimates were derived using inputs for the engine size. vehicle mass. and compression ratio. The likely 2020 on-road fuel consumption of the average SI and CI vehicles was estimated to be 6.5 L/100 km and 5.8 L/100 km. respectively. which represents a 21% and 16% reduction over the average 2011 NEDC estimate.

1281862,A Wireless Smart Sensor Network for Flood Management Optimization,2017,Hossam Adden Alfarra and Mohammed Hayyan Alsibai,7,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCES (IJETS),1,7,UMP,Recent development in the sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks has encouraged many innovative applications in disaster management and forecasting. Flood is one of the most dangerous natural disasters that occurs frequently in south Asia. Therefore. water level monitoring and flood early prediction. play an important role in lives and properties saving. In this paper. an optimized Flood Warning System (FWS) is presented. The system is based on multi parameters Wireless Smart Sensor Network (WSSN) for early flood warning. WSSN performs pre-processing procedures at sensor level before sending the data to a base data analyzing station. This pre-processing step is to improve the reliability. data quality and transmission quality. For the purpose of validation. the proposed method is applied using two parameters: The water level (L) and streamflow of water (R) in rivers. The proposed system provides early flood detection by continuously measuring R and L in real-time. The collected data is to be used to predict flood time and place. Data is exchanged among sensors in real-time. Pre-analyzing is performed and reports are sent to the base station only if the analysis gave a high risk level. The main purpose is to cut down the data size. Analysis and simulation showed that the data size is improved significantly using this method.

This is done to evaluate the method and to compare the platforms. The platforms are compared according to two factors: development simplicity and performance. The target is evaluating the possibility of replacing personal computers using Windows operating system by mobile devices using Android operating system. Face recognition has been chosen because of the relatively high computing cost of image processing and pattern recognition applications comparing with other applications. The experiment results show acceptable performance of the method on Android platform.,True,Nv5G-CcAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,4,http://umpir.ump.edu.my/11923/1/Enhanced%20Face%20Recognition%20Method%20Performance%20on%20Android%20vs%20Windows.pdf,7255765482822191208,/scholar?cites=7255765482822191208,,,http://umpir.ump.edu.my/11923/1/Enhanced%20Face%20Recognition%20Method%20Performance%20on%20Android%20vs%20Windows.pdf,0,0,0

1281864,Recognition of Blue Traffic Signs Enhanced by Aggregating Fragmentary Segmented Sign Images,2011,Mohammed Hayyan Alsibai and Yuzo Hirai,,,,,,This paper proposes a new algorithm for aggregating fragmented images to enhance the recognition of blue traffic signs designating directions. The system is designed for the assistance of safe driving. Subspace method and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features are used for classification. More than one subspace for each arrow class is used to cover complex distributions of arrow patterns. The system consists of several processing steps including labeling the blue objects in each frame. segmenting them from the background and classifying them by subspace method. One of the difficulties in this process is the fragmented detection of single signs. Direction signs consist of a white arrow surrounded by a blue background. Due to motion blur or some lighting conditions. the white area can spread into the blue area and blue background of the sign can be disconnected after the labeling step. To aggregate the broken backgrounds of the signs a new algorithm is designed by taking into account the shape information of the signs and arrows.,True,Nv5G-CcAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammed_Hayyan_Alsibai/publication/266630376_Recognition_of_Blue_Traffic_Signs_Enhanced_by_Aggregating_Fragmentarily_Segmented_Sign_Images/links/579c6df808ae5d5e1e14a315.pdf,377663292019922659,/scholar?cites=377663292019922659,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammed_Hayyan_Alsibai/publication/266630376_Recognition_of_Blue_Traffic_Signs_Enhanced_by_Aggregating_Fragmentarily_Segmented_Sign_Images/links/579c6df808ae5d5e1e14a315.pdf,0,0,0

However. message transmissions via the Internet have some problems. such as information security. copyright protection. and so on. Therefore. we need a secure communication method to transmit messages via the Internet. Steganography is a technique that hides secret data into cover media by altering its most insignificant components. such that an unauthorized user will not be aware of the existence of the secret data. In recent years the development of artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic has started a new period in the whole science. The proposed scheme has taken into consideration the property that more information can be hidden into the edge areas rather than in the smooth areas.

Furthermore. the FDT is considered an approach to model a system by making use of a descriptive language with fuzzy logic and fuzzy predicates. There exist two contradictory requirements with fuzzy modeling. namely. accuracy and interpretability. In this study. the subtractive clustering and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm are used to develop a novel fuzzy modeling scheme based on the FDT classifier to construct an accurate and interpretable system that is defined as the interpretability-based fuzzy decision tree classifier. Two interpretability measures. namely. complexity interpretability and semantics interpretability are considered to reach acceptable accuracy.

Until now many kernel learning methods have been introduced for clustering when side information in the form of pairwise constraints is available. However. almost all of the existing methods either learn a whole kernel matrix or learn a limited number of parameters. Although the non-parametric methods that learn whole kernel matrix can provide capability of finding clusters of arbitrary structures. they are very computationally expensive and these methods are feasible only on small data sets. In this paper. we propose a kernel learning method that shows flexibility in the number of variables between the two extremes of freedom degree.

The optimized value for the negation parameter is determined based on a notion of the entropy of IVIFSs.

Intuitionistic fuzzy sets consider not only membership degree of belonging but also take into account the uncertainty involved in membership degree known as hesitation measure. Color features (expressed in various color representation systems). were intensively used (independently or jointly) during the last decade. We propose to revisit the use of color image contents as image descriptors through the introduction of fuzziness. which naturally arise from the imprecision or vagueness of the pixel color values and human perception. This has been applied in the HSV color space.

However. since the quality of back-translation models is tied to the size of the available parallel corpora. this could adversely impact the synthetically generated sentences in a low resource setting. We propose a simple data augmentation technique to address both this shortcoming. We incorporate widely available bilingual dictionaries that yield word-by-word translations to generate synthetic sentences. This automatically expands the vocabulary of the model while maintaining high quality content. Our method shows an appreciable improvement in performance over strong baselines.,True,vOzG08oAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02071,11916714790016375010,/scholar?cites=11916714790016375010,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02071,0,0,0

1281882,Visual Themes and Sentiment on Social Networks To Aid First Responders During Crisis Events,2016,Prateek Dewan and Varun Bharadhwaj and Aditi Mithal and Anshuman Suri and Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.07772,,,,Online Social Networks explode with activity whenever a crisis event takes place. Most content generated as part of this activity is a mixture of text and images. and is particularly useful for first responders to identify popular topics of interest and gauge the pulse and sentiment of citizens. While multiple researchers have used text to identify. analyze and measure themes and public sentiment during such events. little work has explored visual themes floating on networks in the form of images. and the sentiment inspired by them. Given the potential of visual content for influencing users' thoughts and emotions. we perform a large scale analysis to compare popular themes and sentiment across images and textual content posted on Facebook during the terror attacks that took place in Paris in 2015. Using state-of-the-art image summarization techniques. we discovered multiple visual themes which were popular in images. but were not identifiable through text. We uncovered instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular image themes. which were not prominent in user generated textual content. and can be of particular inter-est to first responders. Our analysis also revealed that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative sentiment. images inspired positive sentiment. To the best of our knowledge. this is the first large scale study of images posted on social networks during a crisis event.,True,vOzG08oAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07772,10449180172906319273,/scholar?cites=10449180172906319273,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07772,0,0,0

In order to remove this limitation this paper proposes a novel algorithm based on hybridization of Harmony search and Simulated Annealing called HS-SA to inherit their advantages in a complementary way. Taking the inspiration from Simulated Annealing the proposed HS-SA algorithm accepts even the inferior harmonies with a probability determined by parameter called Temperature. The Temperature parameter is initially kept high to favor exploration of search space and is linearly decreased to gradually shift focus to exploitation of promising search areas.

Therefore. the search agents of an algorithm always try to explore the unvisited domains of a search space in a balanced manner. The sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is a recent addition to the field of metaheuristics that finds the solution of an optimization problem using the behavior of sine and cosine functions. However. in some cases. the SCA skips the true solutions and trapped at sub-optimal solutions. These problems lead to the premature convergence. which is harmful in determining the global optima. Therefore. in order to alleviate the above-mentioned issues. the present study aims to establish a comparatively better synergy between exploration and exploitation in the SCA.

The efficiency of evolutionary algorithms depends on the extent of balance between diversification and intensification during the course of the search. An ideal evolutionary algorithm must have efficient exploration in the beginning and enhanced exploitation toward the end. In this paper. a two‐phase harmony search (TPHS) algorithm is proposed that attempts to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation by concentrating on diversification in the first phase using catastrophic mutation and then switches to intensification using local search in the second phase.

Given its crucial role in enabling the Internet of Things. a significant amount of research effort has already been devoted to RPL. However. the RPL network convergence process has not yet been investigated in detail. In this paper we study the influence of the main RPL parameters and mechanisms on the network convergence process of this protocol in IEEE 802.15. 4 multihop networks. We also propose and evaluate a mechanism that leverages an option available in RPL for accelerating the network convergence process. We carry out extensive simulations for a wide range of conditions. considering different network scenarios in terms of size and density. Results show that network convergence performance depends dramatically on the use and adequate configuration of key RPL parameters and mechanisms. The findings and contributions of this work provide a RPL configuration guideline for network convergence performance tuning. as well as a characterization of the related performance trade-offs.

However. the combination of torsion and axial compression has been rarely studied in spite of its frequent occurrence in bridge columns under earthquake loading. This paper aims at creating a nonlinear FE model to predict the behavior of RC bridge columns under combined torsion and axial compression. A number of circular and square columns were analyzed. The developed FE model was calibrated on local and global behavior through comparison with test data. The overall torque–twist behavior of the members was captured well by the developed FE models. The predicted values of strain in the longitudinal and transverse reinforcement matched closely with the experimental results.

1281911,Effect of tension stiffening on the behaviour of square RC columns under torsion,2015,T Ghosh Mondal and S Suriya Prakash,54,Struct. Eng. Mech. J,3,501-520,,Presence of torsional loadings can significantly affect the flow of internal forces and deformation capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) columns. It increases the possibility of brittle shear failure leading to catastrophic collapse of structural members. This necessitates accurate prediction of the torsional behaviour of RC members for their safe design. However. a review of previously published studies indicates that the torsional behaviour of RC members has not been studied in as much depth as the behaviour under flexure and shear in spite of its frequent occurrence in bridge columns. Very few analytical models are available to predict the response of RC members under torsional loads. Softened truss model (STM) developed in the University of Houston is one of them. which is widely used for this purpose. The present study shows that STM prediction is not sufficiently accurate particularly in the post cracking region when compared to test results. An improved analytical model for RC square columns subjected to torsion with and without axial compression is developed. Since concrete is weak in tension. its contribution to torsional capacity of RC members was neglected in the original STM. The present investigation revealed that. disregard to tensile strength of concrete is the main reason behind the discrepancies in the STM predictions. The existing STM is extended in this paper to include the effect of tension stiffening for better prediction of behaviour of square RC columns under torsion. Three different tension stiffening models comprising a linear. a quadratic and an exponential relationship have been considered in this study.

1281913,Hysteresis modelling of reinforced concrete columns under pure cyclic torsional loading,2017,Tarutal Ghosh Mondal and Sriharsha R Kothamuthyala and S Suriya Prakash,64,Structural engineering and mechanics,1,11-21,Techno-Press,It has been observed in the past that. the reinforced concrete (RC) bridge columns are very often subjected to torsional moment in addition to flexure and shear during seismic vibration. Ignoring torsion in the design can trigger unexpected shear failure of the columns (Farhey et al. 1993). Performance based seismic design is a popular design philosophy which calls for accurate prediction of the hysteresis behavior of structural elements to ensure safe and economical design under earthquake loading. However. very few investigations in the past focused on the development of analytical models to accurately predict the response of RC members under cyclic torsion. Previously developed hysteresis models are not readily applicable for torsional loading owing to significant pinching and stiffness degradation associated with torsion (Wang et al. 2014). The present study proposes an improved polygonal hysteresis model which can accurately predict the hysteretic behavior of RC circular and square columns under torsion. The primary curve is obtained from mechanics based softened truss model for torsion. The proposed model is validated with test data of two circular and two square columns.

Furthermore. the softened truss model (STM) was developed to predict the torsional response of square sections and it cannot be directly used for circular sections.

Among the hysteresis models available in the literature. the differential model proposed by Bouc-Wen is most widely used. owing to its robustness. This model involves many parameters that define the shape of the hysteresis loops. Estimating these unknown parameters is an identification problem that can be tackled by optimization algorithms by using prediction error as the objective function. Stochastic methods like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms can help find global minima but at a high computational cost. Here. the homotopy technique is employed to identify the unknown parameters. The efficiency of this technique in identifying the parameters of the Bouc–Wen model is demonstrated with examples.

Spatially incoherent but temporally sorted archival images captured by robotic cameras are exploited to represent the damage evolution over a long period of time. An access to a sequence of time-stamped inspection data recording the damage growth dynamics is premised to this end. Identification of a structural defect in the most recent inspection data set triggers an exhaustive search into the images collected during the previous inspections looking for correspondences based on spatial proximity. This is followed by a view synthesis from multiple candidate images resulting in a single reconstruction for each inspection round. Cracks on concrete surface are used as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Once the chronology is established. the damage severity is quantified at various levels of time scale documenting its progression through time. The proposed scheme enables the prediction of damage severity at a future point in time providing a scope for preemptive measures against imminent structural failure.

The standard PCA works on 1-dimensional vectors which has inherent problem of dealing with high dimensional vector space data such as images. whereas 2DPCA directly works on matrices ie in 2DPCA. PCA technique is applied directly on original image without transforming into 1 dimensional vector. This feature of 2DPCA has advantage over standard PCA in terms of dealing with high dimensional vector space data. In this paper a working principle is proposed for color image compression using 2DPCA. Several other variants of 2DPCA are also applied and the proposed method effectively combines several 2DPCA based techniques.

While this provides important information it is also necessary to continue developing objective measures. In this work we further investigate the studies concerning the use of 3D gait analysis to attain this goal. The gait analysis was associated with machine learning methods in order to provide a direct measure of patient control gait discrimination. The applied machine learning method was the support vector machine (SVM). Applying the SVM on all the measured kinematic trajectories. we were able to classify individual patient and control gait cycles with a mean success rate of 88%. With the use of an ROC curve to establish the threshold number of cycles necessary for a subject to be identified as a patient. this allowed for an accuracy of higher than 90% for discriminating patient and control subjects.We then went on to …,True,-FG_fMcAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,14,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482514002637,1721371172111150910,/scholar?cites=1721371172111150910,,,,0,0,0

1281922,An ensemble analysis of electromyographic activity during whole body pointing with the use of support vector machines,2011,Arvind Tolambiya and Elizabeth Thomas and Enrico Chiovetto and Bastien Berret and Thierry Pozzo,6,PloS one,7,e20732,Public Library of Science,We explored the use of support vector machines (SVM) in order to analyze the ensemble activities of 24 postural and focal muscles recorded during a whole body pointing task. Because of the large number of variables involved in motor control studies. such multivariate methods have much to offer over the standard univariate techniques that are currently employed in the field to detect modifications. The SVM was used to uncover the principle differences underlying several variations of the task. Five variants of the task were used. An unconstrained reaching. two constrained at the focal level and two at the postural level. Using the electromyographic (EMG) data. the SVM proved capable of distinguishing all the unconstrained from the constrained conditions with a success of approximately 80% or above. In all cases. including those with focal constraints. the collective postural muscle EMGs were as good as or better than those from focal muscles for discriminating between conditions. This was unexpected especially in the case with focal constraints. In trying to rank the importance of particular features of the postural EMGs we found the maximum amplitude rather than the moment at which it occurred to be more discriminative. A classification using the muscles one at a time permitted us to identify some of the postural muscles that are significantly altered between conditions. In this case. the use of a multivariate method also permitted the use of the entire muscle EMG waveform rather than the difficult process of defining and extracting any particular variable. The best accuracy was obtained from muscles of the leg rather than from the trunk.

The algorithm combines WSVM learning with discrete wavelet decomposition technique. Compression is achieved by approximating wavelet coefficients at each subband separately using WSVM regression.

Several previous studies have shown that they are task dependant. The previous studies. however. have mostly been limited in demonstrating the presence of modulation for one task condition. that is. one aspect such as the distance of the target or the direction of reaching. Real-life activities like whole-body pointing. however. can vary in several ways. How specific is the adaptation of the postural activities for the diverse possibilities of a whole-body pointing task? We used a classification paradigm to answer this question. We examined the anticipatory postural electromyograms for four different types of whole-body pointing tasks. The presence of task-dependent modulations in these signals was probed by performing four-way classification tests using a support vector machine (SVM).

In cases of severe glaucoma. the boundary of the optic cup can become very steep and difficult to segment.

The method is widely used in numerous medical image segmentation applications. However. nodes in the graph based optimal surface segmentation method typically encode uniformly distributed orthogonal voxels of the volume. Thus the segmentation cannot attain an accuracy greater than a single unit voxel. i.e. the distance between two adjoining nodes in graph space. Segmentation accuracy higher than a unit voxel is achievable by exploiting partial volume information in the voxels which shall result in non-equidistant spacing between adjoining graph nodes.

1281940,Hybrid RGSA and support vector machine framework for three-dimensional magnetic resonance brain tumor classification,2015,R Rajesh Sharma and P Marikkannu,2015,The Scientific World Journal,,,Hindawi,A novel hybrid approach for the identification of brain regions using magnetic resonance images accountable for brain tumor is presented in this paper. Classification of medical images is substantial in both clinical and research areas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality outperforms towards diagnosing brain abnormalities like brain tumor. multiple sclerosis. hemorrhage. and many more. The primary objective of this work is to propose a three-dimensional (3D) novel brain tumor classification model using MRI images with both micro- and macroscale textures designed to differentiate the MRI of brain under two classes of lesion. benign and malignant. The design approach was initially preprocessed using 3D Gaussian filter. Based on VOI (volume of interest) of the image. features were extracted using 3D volumetric Square Centroid Lines Gray Level Distribution Method (SCLGM) along with 3D run length and cooccurrence matrix. The optimal features are selected using the proposed refined gravitational search algorithm (RGSA). Support vector machines. over backpropagation network. and -nearest neighbor are used to evaluate the goodness of classifier approach. The preliminary evaluation of the system is performed using 320 real-time brain MRI images. The system is trained and tested by using a leave-one-case-out method. The performance of the classifier is tested using the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.986 (±002). The experimental results demonstrate the systematic and efficient feature extraction and feature selection algorithm to the performance of state-of-the-art feature classification methods.,True,vkA_UWEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,16,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2015/184350/abs/,14043030487162697927,/scholar?cites=14043030487162697927,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2015/184350/abs/,0,0,0

1281967,Real-Time (Vision-Based) Road Sign Recognition Using an Artificial Neural Network,2017,Kh Islam and Ram Raj,17,Sensors,4,853,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Road sign recognition is a driver support function that can be used to notify and warn the driver by showing the restrictions that may be effective on the current stretch of road. Examples for such regulations are ‘traffic light ahead’or ‘pedestrian crossing’indications. The present investigation targets the recognition of Malaysian road and traffic signs in real-time. Real-time video is taken by a digital camera from a moving vehicle and real world road signs are then extracted using vision-only information. The system is based on two stages. one performs the detection and another one is for recognition. In the first stage. a hybrid color segmentation algorithm has been developed and tested. In the second stage. an introduced robust custom feature extraction method is used for the first time in a road sign recognition approach. Finally. a multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) has been created to recognize and interpret various road signs. It is robust because it has been tested on both standard and non-standard road signs with significant recognition accuracy. This proposed system achieved an average of 99.90% accuracy with 99.90% of sensitivity. 99.90% of specificity. 99.90% of f-measure. and 0.001 of false positive rate (FPR) with 0.3 s computational time.

It may be effective for traffic conditions on the current road traffic system. A robust artificial intelligence based traffic sign recognition system can support the driver and significantly reduce driving risk and injury. It performs by recognizing and interpreting various traffic sign using vision-based information. This study aims to recognize the well-maintained. un-maintained. standard. and non-standard traffic signs using the Bag-of-Words and the Artificial Neural Network techniques. This research work employs a Bag-of-Words model on the Speeded Up Robust Features descriptors of the road traffic signs. A robust classifier Artificial Neural Network has been employed to recognize the traffic sign in its respective class. The proposed system has been trained and tested to determine the suitable neural network architecture. The experimental results showed high accuracy of classification of traffic signs including complex background images. The proposed traffic sign detection and recognition system obtained 99.00% classification accuracy with a 1.00% false positive rate. For real-time implementation and deployment. this marginal false positive rate may increase reliability and stability of the proposed system.

1281973,A Deep Transfer Learning Framework for Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray Images,2020,Kh Tohidul Islam and Sudanthi Wijewickrema and Aaron Collins and Stephen O’Leary,5,,,286-293,,Pneumonia occurs when the lungs are infected by a bacterial. viral. or fungal infection. Globally. it is the largest solo infectious disease causing child mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment of this disease are critical to avoid death. especially in infants. Traditionally. pneumonia diagnosis was performed by expert radiologists and/or doctors by analysing X-ray images of the chest. Automated diagnostic methods have been developed in recent years as an alternative to expert diagnosis. Deep learning-based image processing has been shown to be effective in automated diagnosis of pneumonia. However. deep leaning typically requires a large number of labelled samples for training. which is time consuming and expensive to obtain in medical applications as it requires the input of human experts. Transfer learning. where a model pretrained for a task on an existing labelled database is adapted to be reused for a different but related task. is a common workaround to this issue. Here. we explore the use of deep transfer learning to diagnose pneumonia using X-ray images of the chest. We demonstrate that using two individual pretrained models as feature extractors and training an artificial neural network on these features is an effective way to diagnose pneumonia.

With the increasing number of vehicles. it is important that an effective real-time system for automated license plate recognition is developed. Computer vision techniques are typically used for this task. However. it remains a challenging problem. as both high accuracy and low processing time are required in such a system. Here. we propose a method for license plate recognition that seeks to find a balance between these two requirements. The proposed method consists of two stages: detection and recognition.

1281977,Identifying diabetic retinopathy from oct images using deep transfer learning with artificial neural networks,2019,Kh Tohidul Islam and Sudanthi Wijewickrema and Stephen O'Leary,,,,281-286,IEEE,Diabetic retinopathy occurs when the blood vessels inside the retina are damaged as a result of diabetes. Early diagnosis and treatment of this disease is crucial to avoid blindness. Analysis of retinal images such as funduscopy. ultrasonography. and optical coherence tomography (OCT) is typically used in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. In recent years. various automated techniques including deep learning have been used for this purpose. In this paper. we explore how to use deep transfer learning for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy using OCT images. We retrain existing deep learning models for this task and investigate how a retrained model can be optimized. We demonstrate that using an optimized pre-trained model as a feature extractor and training a conventional classifier on these features is an effective way to diagnose diabetic retinopathy using OCT images.

While the traditional techniques for short answer grading are rooted in statistical learning and hand-crafted features. recent research has explored sentence embedding based techniques. We observe that sentence embedding techniques. while being effective for grading in-domain student answers. may not be best suited for out-of-domain answers. Further. sentence embeddings can be affected by non-sentential answers (answers given in the context of the question). On the other hand. token level hand-crafted features can be fairly domain independent and are less affected by non-sentential forms.

1281984,PRover: Proof Generation for Interpretable Reasoning over Rules,2020,Swarnadeep Saha and Sayan Ghosh and Shashank Srivastava and Mohit Bansal,,EMNLP 2020,,,,Recent work by Clark et al.(2020) shows that transformers can act as' soft theorem provers' by answering questions over explicitly provided knowledge in natural language. In our work. we take a step closer to emulating formal theorem provers. by proposing PROVER. an interpretable transformer-based model that jointly answers binary questions over rule-bases and generates the corresponding proofs. Our model learns to predict nodes and edges corresponding to proof graphs in an efficient constrained training paradigm. During inference. a valid proof. satisfying a set of global constraints is generated. We conduct experiments on synthetic. hand-authored. and human-paraphrased rule-bases to show promising results for QA and proof generation. with strong generalization performance. First. PROVER generates proofs with an accuracy of 87%. while retaining or improving performance on the QA task. compared to RuleTakers (up to 6% improvement on zero-shot evaluation). Second. when trained on questions requiring lower depths of reasoning. it generalizes significantly better to higher depths (up to 15% improvement). Third. PROVER obtains near perfect QA accuracy of 98% using only 40% of the training data. However. generating proofs for questions requiring higher depths of reasoning becomes challenging. and the accuracy drops to 65% for'depth 5'. indicating significant scope for future work.

Existing NLI stress tests do not consider non-boolean usages of conjunctions and use templates for testing such model knowledge. Hence. we introduce ConjNLI. a challenge stress-test for natural language inference over conjunctive sentences. where the premise differs from the hypothesis by conjuncts removed. added. or replaced. These sentences contain single and multiple instances of coordinating conjunctions ("" and""."" or""."" but""."" nor"") with quantifiers. negations. and requiring diverse boolean and non-boolean inferences over conjuncts. We find that large-scale pre-trained language models like RoBERTa do not understand conjunctive semantics well and resort to shallow heuristics to make inferences over such sentences. As some initial solutions. we first present an iterative adversarial fine-tuning method that uses synthetically created training data based on boolean and non-boolean heuristics. We also propose a direct model advancement by making RoBERTa aware of predicate semantic roles. While we observe some performance gains.

A typical automatic short answer grading system (ASAG) grades student answers across multiple domains (or subjects). Grading student answers requires building a supervised machine learning model that evaluates the similarity of the student answer with the reference answer (s). We observe that unlike typical textual similarity or entailment tasks. the notion of similarity is not universal here. On one hand. para-phrasal constructs of the language can indicate similarity independent of the domain. On the other hand. two words. or phrases. that are not strict synonyms of each other. might mean the same in certain domains. Building on this observation. we propose JMD-ASAG. the first joint multidomain deep learning architecture for automatic short answer grading that performs domain adaptation by learning generic and domain-specific aspects from the limited domain-wise training data. JMD-ASAG not only learns the domain-specific characteristics but also overcomes the dependence on a large corpus by learning the generic characteristics from the task-specific data itself. On a large-scale industry dataset and a benchmarking dataset. we show that our model performs significantly better than existing techniques which either learn domain-specific models or adapt a generic similarity scoring model from a large corpus. Further. on the benchmarking dataset. we report state-of-the-art results against all existing non-neural and neural models.,True,sY5SyBgAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09183,4535982217223200058,/scholar?cites=4535982217223200058,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09183,0,0,0

In general. the problem can be viewed as finding the relevant sections of a document (LR) that is pertinent to a broad question (LO). In this paper. we introduce the novel problem of aligning LOs (LO is usually a sentence long text) to relevant pages of LRs (LRs are in the form of slide decks). We observe that the set of relevant pages can be composed of multiple chunks (a chunk is a contiguous set of pages) and the same page of an LR might be relevant to multiple LOs. To this end. we develop a novel Lexico-Semantic Spatial approach that captures the lexical. semantic. and spatial aspects of the task. and also alleviates the limited availability of training data. Our approach first identifies the relevancy of a page to an LO by using lexical and semantic features from each page independently. The spatial model at a later stage exploits the dependencies between the sequence of pages in the LR to further improve the alignment task. We empirically establish the importance of the lexical. semantic. and spatial models within the proposed approach. We show that. on average. a student can navigate to a relevant page from the first predicted page by about four clicks within a 38 page slide deck. as compared to two clicks by human experts.,True,sY5SyBgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Swarnadeep_Saha/publication/334130841_Aligning_Learning_Outcomes_to_Learning_Resources_A_Lexico-Semantic_Spatial_Approach/links/5d19b531299bf1547c8cea6f/Aligning-Learning-Outcomes-to-Learning-Resources-A-Lexico-Semantic-Spatial-Approach.pdf,15907349508237153575,/scholar?cites=15907349508237153575,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Swarnadeep_Saha/publication/334130841_Aligning_Learning_Outcomes_to_Learning_Resources_A_Lexico-Semantic_Spatial_Approach/links/5d19b531299bf1547c8cea6f/Aligning-Learning-Outcomes-to-Learning-Resources-A-Lexico-Semantic-Spatial-Approach.pdf,0,0,0

Violin makers have been empirically aware of the fact that a bridge is an important element which influences violin timbre. Thus. a bridge can be regarded as a mechanical filter in the transmission and be used to compensate weak or too strong areas in the resonance of the violin body. The filtering characteristics of a bridge depend on the geometry and material distribution of the bridge. In this paper. the sensitivity of band-averaged frequency response with respect to geometric design variables is derived. Then. topology optimization is applied to obtain optimal violin bridges for desired filtering characteristics.

The total damping consists of acoustical damping and internal damping. Acoustical damping depends upon resonating frequencies and vibration patterns while internal damping is a material property. The acoustical damping of a vibrating structure is formulated via boundary element method and finite element method using eigenmode decomposition. The design sensitivity of acoustical damping is derived using an adjoint variable method of the eigenvalue problem.

This approach is a new efficient method for large-scale topology optimization by virtue of two reasons. First. design space adjustment including design space expansion and reduction is suitable for large-scale problems. Second. the design space refinement can be done globally or locally where and when necessary and thus is very effective in obtaining a target resolution with much less number of elements.

Robotics and Systems and The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers,Mobile Harbor (MH) was recently proposed by KAIST as a novel maritime cargo transfer system that can go out to a container ship anchored in deep water and handle containers at sea. Since the system operates in at-sea conditions with waves and wind. the MH crane should be designed to suppress the swing motion of a spreader and compensate the relative motion between the MH and a container ship. For that purpose. we devised a state-of-the-art crane system equipped with a dual stage trolley. tension controller. and intelligent spreader with 3 degrees of freedom. We also integrated a robust sensing system to measure remote motions in harsh open-sea condition.

A container hooked to a spreader is suspended in air by four ropes. When the container is accelerated by the trolley or is disturbed by winds. it rotates (trim. list. and skew) as well as sways in the vertical plane. When this happens. the accurate positioning of the container becomes difficult because of the rotation even with the swaying under control. This paper proposes a feedback control technique for the orientation control of the container based on the dynamics of the spreader including the container.

A node measures the relative position and velocity of its neighbours and checks whether a certain critical condition is satisfied or not.

Unfortunately. clean and fully sampled ground-truth data to train the deep networks is often not available in several applications. restricting the applicability of the above methods. This work introduces the ENsemble Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (ENSURE) framework as a general approach to train deep image reconstruction algorithms without fully sampled and noise-free images. The proposed framework is the generalization of the classical SURE and GSURE formulation to the setting where the images are sampled by different measurement operators. chosen randomly from a set. We show that the ENSURE loss function. which only uses the measurement data. is an unbiased estimate for the true mean-square error. Our experiments show that the networks trained with this loss function can offer reconstructions comparable to the supervised setting.

1282013,Plasma electron hole kinematics. II. Hole tracking Particle-In-Cell simulation,2016,C Zhou and IH Hutchinson,23,Physics of Plasmas,8,082102,AIP Publishing LLC,The kinematics of a 1-D electron hole is studied using a novel Particle-In-Cell simulation code. A hole tracking technique enables us to follow the trajectory of a fast-moving solitary hole and study quantitatively hole acceleration and coupling to ions. We observe a transient at the initial stage of hole formation when the hole accelerates to several times the cold-ion sound speed. Artificially imposing slow ion speed changes on a fully formed hole causes its velocity to change even when the ion stream speed in the hole frame greatly exceeds the ion thermal speed. so there are no reflected ions. The behavior that we observe in numerical simulations agrees very well with our analytic theory of hole momentum conservation and the effects of “jetting.”,True,IQbOdyYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,15,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4959871,2412630223136263343,/scholar?cites=2412630223136263343,,,https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1467859,0,0,0

When a hole accelerates or grows in depth. ion and electron plasma momentum is changed both within the hole and outside. by an energization process we call jetting.

Such situations include. for example. the moon in the solar wind and probes in magnetized laboratory plasmas. The instability drive mechanism can equivalently be considered drift down the potential-energy gradient or drift up the density-gradient. The gradients arise because the plasma wake has a region of depressed density and electrostatic potential into which ions are attracted along the field. The non-linear consequences of the instability are analysed in this paper. At physical ratios of electron to ion mass. neither linear nor quasilinear treatment can explain the observation of large-amplitude perturbations that disrupt the ion streams well before they become ion-ion unstable.

A hybrid electrostatic Boltzmann electron treatment is first used to investigate the ion stability in the absence of kinetic electron effects. showing that the ions are two-stream unstable for downstream wake distances (in lunar radii) greater than about three times the solar wind Mach number. Simulations with PIC electrons are then used to show that kinetic electron effects can lead to disruption of the ion beams at least three times closer to the moon than in the hybrid simulations.

However. so-called TinyML presents severe technical challenges. as deep neural network inference demands a large compute and memory budget. To address this challenge. neural architecture search (NAS) promises to help design accurate ML models that meet the tight MCU memory. latency. and energy constraints. A key component of NAS algorithms is their latency/energy model. ie. the mapping from a given neural network architecture to its inference latency/energy on an MCU. In this paper. we observe an intriguing property of NAS search spaces for MCU model design: on average. model latency varies linearly with model operation (op) count under a uniform prior over models in the search space. Exploiting this insight. we employ differentiable NAS (DNAS) to search for models with low memory usage and low op count. where op count is treated as a viable proxy to latency. Experimental results validate our methodology. yielding our MicroNet models. which we deploy on MCUs using Tensorflow Lite Micro. a standard open-source neural network (NN) inference runtime widely used in the TinyML community. MicroNets demonstrate state-of-the-art results for all three TinyMLperf industry-standard benchmark tasks: visual wake words. audio keyword spotting. and anomaly detection.

The nonlinear interaction of EHs and ions is investigated using a new theory of hole kinematics. It is shown that the oscillation in the velocity of the EH parallel to the magnetic field direction becomes unstable when the hole velocity in the ion frame is slower than a few times the cold ion sound speed. This instability leads to the emission of ion-acoustic waves from the solitary hole and decay in its magnitude. The instability mechanism can drive significant perturbations in the ion density.

Collision tests reveal that its collisional dynamics are a hybrid of soliton collision and electron hole merging. This hybrid state is separated from the classical free electron hole branch by a gap in their ion-frame velocities. Transition is possible from the coupled state to the free state by ion Landau damping and in the opposite direction by hole growth. Buneman instability simulation is performed. showing generation of both types of electron holes depending on the ion temperature.

1282021,Noisy machines: Understanding noisy neural networks and enhancing robustness to analog hardware errors using distillation,2020,Chuteng Zhou and Prad Kadambi and Matthew Mattina and Paul N Whatmough,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04974,,,,The success of deep learning has brought forth a wave of interest in computer hardware design to better meet the high demands of neural network inference. In particular. analog computing hardware has been heavily motivated specifically for accelerating neural networks. based on either electronic. optical or photonic devices. which may well achieve lower power consumption than conventional digital electronics. However. these proposed analog accelerators suffer from the intrinsic noise generated by their physical components. which makes it challenging to achieve high accuracy on deep neural networks. Hence. for successful deployment on analog accelerators. it is essential to be able to train deep neural networks to be robust to random continuous noise in the network weights. which is a somewhat new challenge in machine learning. In this paper. we advance the understanding of noisy neural networks. We outline how a noisy neural network has reduced learning capacity as a result of loss of mutual information between its input and output. To combat this. we propose using knowledge distillation combined with noise injection during training to achieve more noise robust networks. which is demonstrated experimentally across different networks and datasets. including ImageNet. Our method achieves models with as much as two times greater noise tolerance compared with the previous best attempts. which is a significant step towards making analog hardware practical for deep learning.,True,IQbOdyYAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04974,1481831764241114986,/scholar?cites=1481831764241114986,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04974,0,0,0

Most existing approaches generated perturbations in the image space. ie. each pixel can be modified independently. However. in this paper we pay special attention to the subset of adversarial examples that correspond to meaningful changes in 3D physical properties (like rotation and translation. illumination condition. etc.). These adversaries arguably pose a more serious concern. as they demonstrate the possibility of causing neural network failure by easy perturbations of real-world 3D objects and scenes. In the contexts of object classification and visual question answering. we augment state-of-the-art deep neural networks that receive 2D input images with a rendering module (either differentiable or not) in front. so that a 3D scene (in the physical space) is rendered into a 2D image (in the image space). and then mapped to a prediction (in the output space). The adversarial perturbations can now go beyond the image space. and have clear meanings in the 3D physical world. Though image-space adversaries can be interpreted as per-pixel albedo change. we verify that they cannot be well explained along these physically meaningful dimensions. which often have a non-local effect. But it is still possible to successfully attack beyond the image space on the physical space. though this is more difficult than image-space attacks. reflected in lower success rates and heavier perturbations required.,True,89kHyuEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,66,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Zeng_Adversarial_Attacks_Beyond_the_Image_Space_CVPR_2019_paper.html,3341871707485172091,/scholar?cites=3341871707485172091,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zeng_Adversarial_Attacks_Beyond_the_Image_Space_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf,0,0,0

In contrast to classical sequential labeling methods. the system first identifies which text chunks are possible named entities by whether they are linguistic constituents.

We propose a"" k-step look-ahead"" module to consider the likelihood information of a rollout up to k steps. Unlike other approaches that need to train another value network to evaluate the rollouts. we can directly apply this look-ahead module to improve the decoding of any sequence model trained in a maximum likelihood framework. We evaluate our look-ahead module on three datasets of varying difficulties: IM2LATEX-100k OCR image to LaTeX. WMT16 multimodal machine translation. and WMT14 machine translation. Our look-ahead module improves the performance of the simpler datasets such as IM2LATEX-100k and WMT16 multimodal machine translation. However. the improvement of the more difficult dataset (eg. containing longer sequences). WMT14 machine translation. becomes marginal. Our further investigation using the k-step look-ahead suggests that the more difficult tasks suffer from the overestimated EOS (end-of-sentence) probability. We argue that the overestimated EOS probability also causes the decreased performance of beam search when increasing its beam width. We tackle the EOS problem by integrating an auxiliary EOS loss into the training to estimate if the model should emit EOS or other words.

However. current VG works are limited in working environments. such as offices and warehouses. where objects are usually occluded due to space utilization issues. In our work. we propose a novel OCID-Ref dataset featuring a referring expression segmentation task with referring expressions of occluded objects. OCID-Ref consists of 305.694 referring expressions from 2.300 scenes with providing RGB image and point cloud inputs. To resolve challenging occlusion issues. we argue that it's crucial to take advantage of both 2D and 3D signals to resolve challenging occlusion issues.

While recent progress of deep learning and natural language processing have enabled learning system to reach human performance on some benchmarks requiring shallow semantics. such human ability still remains challenging for even modern contextual embedding models. as pointed out by many recent studies. Existing machine comprehension datasets assume sentence-level input. lack of casual or motivational inferences. or could be answered with question-answer bias. Here. we present a challenging novel task. trope detection on films. in an effort to create a situation and behavior understanding for machines. Tropes are storytelling devices that are frequently used as ingredients in recipes for creative works. Comparing to existing movie tag prediction tasks. tropes are more sophisticated as they can vary widely. from a moral concept to a series of circumstances. and embedded with motivations and cause-and-effects.

Face verification is a crucial task in recent days and it has been deployed to plenty of applications. such as access control. surveillance. and automatic personal log-on for mobile devices. With the increasing amount of data. deep convolutional neural networks can achieve very high accuracy for the face verification task. Beyond exceptional performances. deep face verification models need more interpretability so that we can trust the results they generate. In this paper. we propose a novel similarity metric. called explainable cosine ($ xCos $). that comes with a learnable module that can be plugged into most of the verification models to provide meaningful explanations. With the help of $ xCos $. we can see which parts of the 2 input faces are similar. where the model pays its attention to. and how the local similarities are weighted to form the output $ xCos $ score.

1282048,Tuning-free controller to accurately regulate flow rates in a microfluidic network,2016,Young Jin Heo and Junsu Kang and Min Jun Kim and Wan Kyun Chung,6,Scientific reports,1,1-12,Nature Publishing Group,We describe a control algorithm that can improve accuracy and stability of flow regulation in a microfluidic network that uses a conventional pressure pump system. The algorithm enables simultaneous and independent control of fluid flows in multiple micro-channels of a microfluidic network. but does not require any model parameters or tuning process. We investigate robustness and optimality of the proposed control algorithm and those are verified by simulations and experiments. In addition. the control algorithm is compared with a conventional PID controller to show that the proposed control algorithm resolves critical problems induced by the PID control. The capability of the control algorithm can be used not only in high-precision flow regulation in the presence of disturbance. but in some useful functions for lab-on-a-chip devices such as regulation of volumetric flow rate. interface position control of two laminar …,True,PS7o9vgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,16,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep23273,1805555696957711839,/scholar?cites=1805555696957711839,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep23273,0,0,0

Confused line and point features in cluttered environments leads to poor SLAM performance. We introduce a sonar feature structure suitable for a cluttered environment and the extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based SLAM scheme. The reliable line feature is expressed by its end points and engaged togather in EKF SLAM to overcome the geometric limits and maintain the map consistency.

Robotics and Systems,In this paper. we research the localization problem of the crawler-type inspection robot for underwater structure which travels an outer wall of underwater structure. Since various factors of the underwater environment affect an encoder odometer. it is hard to localize robot itself using only on-board sensors. So in this research we used a depth sensor and an IMU to compensate odometer which has extreme error in the underwater environment through using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which is normally used in mobile robotics. To acquire valid measurements. we implemented precision sensor modeling after assuming specific situation that robot travels underwater structure. The depth sensor acquires a vertical position of robot and compensates one of the robot pose. and IMU is used to compensate a bearing. But horizontal position of robot can't be compensated by using only on-board sensors. So we proposed a localization algorithm which makes horizontal direction error bounded by using kinematics relationship. Also we implemented computer simulations and experiments in underwater environment to verify the algorithm performance.,True,PS7o9vgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,4,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201302757906882.page,4903699944980980703,/scholar?cites=4903699944980980703,,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201302757906882.pdf,0,0,0

In this context. emerging Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) has been regarded as a promising candidate to replace large on-chip SRAM caches in virtue of its nature of the zero leakage. However. large energy requirement of STT-RAM on write operations. resulting in a huge amount of dynamic energy consumption. precludes it from application to on-chip cache designs. In order to reduce the write energy of the STT-RAM cache thereby the total energy consumption. this paper provides an architectural technique which exploits the fact that many applications process a large number of zero data. The proposed design appends additional flags in cache tag arrays and set these additional bits if the corresponding data in the cache line is the zero-valued data in which all data bits are zero.

This study specifically examines the bit error rate (BER) when considering temperature fluctuation. The SRAM performance is generally determined using a read margin because a half-select issue must be considered even in a write operation. As a metric of the SRAM's performance. we also adopt a static noise margin (SNM) with which we evaluate three methods to estimate the BER considering temperature fluctuation. Method 1 iterates calculations for the SNM many times with Monte Carlo simulation. BER is defined as the number of cells that have no margin. Method 2 includes the assumption that SNM forms a normal distribution. Its BER is defined as a probability distribution function. Method 3 includes the assumption that SNM is determined as either square but not the smaller one of the two squares.

1282066,STGAN: A unified selective transfer network for arbitrary image attribute editing,2019,Ming Liu and Yukang Ding and Min Xia and Xiao Liu and Errui Ding and Wangmeng Zuo and Shilei Wen,,,,3673-3682,,Arbitrary attribute editing generally can be tackled by incorporating encoder-decoder and generative adversarial networks. However. the bottleneck layer in encoder-decoder usually gives rise to blurry and low quality editing result. And adding skip connections improves image quality at the cost of weakened attribute manipulation ability. Moreover. existing methods exploit target attribute vector to guide the flexible translation to desired target domain. In this work. we suggest to address these issues from selective transfer perspective. Considering that specific editing task is certainly only related to the changed attributes instead of all target attributes. our model selectively takes the difference between target and source attribute vectors as input. Furthermore. selective transfer units are incorporated with encoder-decoder to adaptively select and modify encoder feature for enhanced attribute editing. Experiments show that our method (ie. STGAN) simultaneously improves attribute manipulation accuracy as well as perception quality. and performs favorably against state-of-the-arts in arbitrary face attribute editing and season translation.,True,7PMGvggAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,93,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Liu_STGAN_A_Unified_Selective_Transfer_Network_for_Arbitrary_Image_Attribute_CVPR_2019_paper.html,1257277387687196331,/scholar?cites=1257277387687196331,,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Liu_STGAN_A_Unified_Selective_Transfer_Network_for_Arbitrary_Image_Attribute_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf,0,0,0

1282067,Learning warped guidance for blind face restoration,2018,Xiaoming Li and Ming Liu and Yuting Ye and Wangmeng Zuo and Liang Lin and Ruigang Yang,,,,272-289,,This paper studies the problem of blind face restoration from an unconstrained blurry. noisy. low-resolution. or compressed image (ie. degraded observation). For better recovery of fine facial details. we modify the problem setting by taking both the degraded observation and a high-quality guided image of the same identity as input to our guided face restoration network (GFRNet). However. the degraded observation and guided image generally are different in pose. illumination and expression. thereby making plain CNNs (eg. U-Net) fail to recover fine and identity-aware facial details. To tackle this issue. our GFRNet model includes both a warping subnetwork (WarpNet) and a reconstruction subnetwork (RecNet). The WarpNet is introduced to predict flow field for warping the guided image to correct pose and expression (ie. warped guidance). while the RecNet takes the degraded observation and warped guidance as input to produce the restoration result. Due to that the ground-truth flow field is unavailable. landmark loss together with total variation regularization are incorporated to guide the learning of WarpNet. Furthermore. to make the model applicable to blind restoration. our GFRNet is trained on the synthetic data with versatile settings on blur kernel. noise level. downsampling scale factor. and JPEG quality factor. Experiments show that our GFRNet not only performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image and face restoration methods. but also generates visually photo-realistic results on real degraded facial images.,True,7PMGvggAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,34,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Xiaoming_Li_Learning_Warped_Guidance_ECCV_2018_paper.html,2135603410227164832,/scholar?cites=2135603410227164832,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Xiaoming_Li_Learning_Warped_Guidance_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Cham,We investigate the task of learning blind image denoising networks from an unpaired set of clean and noisy images. Such problem setting generally is practical and valuable considering that it is feasible to collect unpaired noisy and clean images in most real-world applications. And we further assume that the noise can be signal dependent but is spatially uncorrelated. In order to facilitate unpaired learning of denoising network. this paper presents a two-stage scheme by incorporating self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation. For self-supervised learning. we suggest a dilated blind-spot network (D-BSN) to learn denoising solely from real noisy images. Due to the spatial independence of noise. we adopt a network by stacking convolution layers to estimate the noise level map for each image.

On the other hand. reflectional symmetry is a prominent property of face images and benefits face analysis and consistency modeling. yet remaining uninvestigated in deep face completion. In this work. we leverage two kinds of symmetry-enforcing modules to form a symmetry-consistent CNN model ( i.e. . SymmFCNet) for effective face completion.

For most existing methods. the computational cost of each SISR model is irrelevant to local image content. hardware platform and application scenario. Nonetheless. content and resource adaptive model is more preferred. and it is encouraging to apply simpler and efficient networks to the easier regions with less details and the scenarios with restricted efficiency constraints. In this paper. we take a step forward to address this issue by leveraging the adaptive inference networks for deep SISR (AdaDSR).

For improving reflection removal. cascaded deep models have been usually adopted to estimate the transmission in a progressive manner. However. most existing methods are still limited in exploiting the result in prior stage for guiding transmission estimation. In this paper. we present a novel two-stage network with reflection-aware guidance (RAGNet) for single image reflection removal (SIRR). To be specific. the reflection layer is firstly estimated due to that it generally is much simpler and is relatively easier to estimate. Reflectionaware guidance (RAG) module is then elaborated for better exploiting the estimated reflection in predicting transmission layer. By incorporating feature maps from the estimated reflection and observation. RAG can be used (i) to mitigate the effect of reflection from the observation. and (ii) to generate mask in partial convolution for mitigating the effect of deviating from linear combination hypothesis. A dedicated mask loss is further presented for reconciling the contributions of encoder and decoder features. Experiments on five commonly used datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative superiority of our RAGNet in comparison to the state-of-the-art SIRR methods.

A range of methods have been applied and evaluated for gait segmentation of healthy and pathological gait bouts. However. a unified evaluation of gait segmentation methods in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is missing. In this paper. we compare four prevalent gait segmentation methods in order to reveal their strengths and drawbacks in gait processing. We considered peak detection from event-based methods. two variations of dynamic time warping from template matching methods. and hierarchical hidden Markov models (hHMMs) from machine learning methods. To evaluate the methods. we included two supervised and instrumented gait tests that are widely used in the examination of Parkinsonian gait. In the first experiment. a sequence of strides from instructed straight walks was measured from 10 PD patients. In the second experiment. a more heterogeneous assessment paradigm was used from an additional 34 PD patients. including straight walks and turning strides as well as non-stride movements. The goal of the latter experiment was to evaluate the methods in challenging situations including turning strides and non-stride movements. Results showed no significant difference between the methods for the first scenario. in which all methods achieved an almost 100% accuracy in terms of F-score. Hence. we concluded that in the case of a predefined and homogeneous sequence of strides. all methods can be applied equally.

Data with an underlying periodic structure appears in many areas. eg. in climatology or robotics. It is often important to predict the long-term evolution of such a time series. and to take the inherent periodicity explicitly into account. In a Gaussian process. periodicity can be accounted for by an appropriate kernel choice. However. the standard periodic kernel does not allow for analytic long-term forecasting. which requires to map distributions through the Gaussian process. To address this shortcoming. we re-parametrize the periodic kernel. which. in combination with a double approximation. allows for analytic long-term forecasting of a periodic state evolution with Gaussian processes.

1282081,Data Driven Methods for Mobile Gait Analysis in Parkinson’s Disease,2021,Nooshin Haji Ghassemi,,,,,,Our understanding of Parkinson’s disease (PD). its symptoms and diagnosis have been expanded considerably since its formal description by James Parkinson two centuries ago [Prze17]. However. this common neurodegenerative disorder has still been a threat to the health and well-being of patients and an economic burden. since a complete treatment is still a formidable barrier. Impaired gait is one of the most characteristic symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. Assessment of movement impairments forms a basis for diagnosis. evaluation of the disease progress and the evaluation of therapeutic interventions. The emergence of wearable technologies has permitted the development of mobile systems for gait analysis. This technology enables us to record large amounts of patients’ data not only during clinical visits but also outside clinics. Data driven methods hold the potential to analyze the large volume of data to provide an objective disease assessment. improve current approaches to manage disease progression. and monitor patients outside clinics. This thesis aims to leverage data driven methods for the development of an objective gait assessment using mobile gait analysis systems. The present thesis answers three main open questions in this domain: development and comparison of four widely used data driven methods for gait segmentation. analysis of turning for on-shoe wearable sensors and interpretable classification of motor impairments. Regarding segmentation of gait sequence to individual strides. three existing segmen- tation methods are implemented and validated for PD population.

Previous approaches of QSM require multiple orientation data (e.g. Calculation of Susceptibility through Multiple Orientation Sampling or COSMOS) or regularization terms (e.g. Truncated K-space Division or TKD; Morphology Enabled Dipole Inversion or MEDI) to solve an ill-conditioned dipole deconvolution problem.

Experimental results demonstrate that the model reveals a high goodness of fit for the R2* distribution of white matter compared to a model that explains either fiber orientation or myelin concentration.

ISMRM,,,,Accurate T 2 mapping using multi-echo spin-echo data is a time-consuming process due to stimulated echo correction. In this study. we developed an artificial neural network for real-time T 2 mapping. The training dataset using both in-vivo data and model-based synthetic data demonstrated the best performance. The resulting T 2 map shows mean T 2 errors of less than 0.3 ms with minimal computation time (less than 1 sec as opposed to 8.3 hours for conventional method). An additional algorithm was developed to ensure the fidelity of the T 2 map at the cost of slightly increased computation time.PurposeThe quantification of T 2 is broadly applied as a means for tissue characterization and disease diagnosis. 1-3 However. accurate T 2 quantification for multi-echo spin-echo data is complicated because it requires correction for the stimulated echoes produced by B 1 inhomogeneity and slice profile (Fig. 1). 4-6 Recently. an integrated model (EPG SLR) has been proposed to compensate for these factors. 6 However. the method requires long processing time. up to several hours per brain volume.

However. the inputs of the networks were designed for a specific diffusion gradient scheme (ie. diffusion gradient directions and numbers) and a specific b-value that are the same as the training data. In this study. a new deep neural network. referred to as DIFFnet. is developed to function as a generalized reconstruction tool of the diffusion-weighted signals for various gradient schemes and b-values. For generalization. diffusion signals are normalized in a q-space and then projected and quantized. producing a matrix (Qmatrix) as an input for the network. To demonstrate the validity of this approach. DIFFnet is evaluated for diffusion tensor imaging (DIFFnetDTI) and for neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (DIFFnetNODDI). In each model. two datasets with different gradient schemes and b-values are tested. The results demonstrate accurate reconstruction of the diffusion parameters at substantially reduced processing time (approximately 8.7 times and 2240 times faster processing time than conventional methods in DTI and NODDI. respectively; less than 4% mean normalized root-mean-square errors (NRMSE) in DTI and less than 8% in NODDI). The generalization capability of the networks was further validated using reduced numbers of diffusion signals from the datasets. Different from previously proposed deep neural networks. DIFFnet does not require any specific gradient scheme and b-value for its input. As a result. it can be adopted as an online reconstruction tool for various complex diffusion imaging.,True,sCFcWDIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02463,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02463,0,0,0

The analysis results of deep cartilage areas showed that the MT ratio of the short T 2* component had significantly larger values than that of the long T 2* component. This observation may be explained by the geometry of collagen fibrils and proteoglycans.PurposeKnee cartilage composition changes in early stage osteoarthritis before apparent morphologic changes occur.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is considered the gold standard for cerebral perfusion measurement. but is not widely available and entails exposure of the subject to radioactivity. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI methods are becoming more widely available on the newest generation of MRI scanners. The standard analysis methods of this data have significant disadvantages that include the use of a single. difficult to measure. arterial input function for the entire brain and the need to perform a numerical deconvolution on the logarithm of noisy data.

Currently. this practice predominantly involves task-based fMRI (T-fMRI). Resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI) offers an alternative with several methodological advantages. Here. we compare group-level analyses of RS-fMRI vs. T-fMRI as methods for language localization.   Purpose To contrast RS-fMRI vs. T-fMRI as techniques for localization of language function.   Methods We analyzed data obtained in 35 patients who had both T-fMRI and RS-fMRI scans during the course of pre-surgical evaluation. The RS-fMRI data were analyzed using a previously trained resting-state network classifier. The T-fMRI data were analyzed using conventional techniques. Group-level results obtained by both methods were evaluated in terms of two outcome measures: (1) inter-subject variability of response magnitude and (2) sensitivity/specificity analysis of response topography. taking as ground truth previously reported maps of the language system based on intraoperative cortical mapping as well as meta-analytic maps of language task fMRI responses.   Results Both fMRI methods localized major components of the language system (areas of Broca and Wernicke) although not with equal inter-subject consistency. Word-stem completion T-fMRI strongly activated Broca's area but also several task-general areas not specific to language. RS-fMRI provided a more specific representation of the language system.

The straightforward method to solve this problem is the resampling method by adding records to the minority class or deleting ones from the majority class. In this paper. we have experimented with the two resampling widely adopted techniques: oversampling and undersampling. In order to explore both techniques. we have chosen a public imbalanced dataset from kaggle website Santander Customer Transaction Prediction and have applied a group of well-known machine learning algorithms with different hyperparamters that give best results for both resampling techniques. One of the key findings of this paper is noticing that oversampling performs better than undersampling for different …,True,93n4ZbEAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,4,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9078901/,13349863482550734016,/scholar?cites=13349863482550734016,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Malak_Abdullah2/publication/341164819_Machine_Learning_with_Oversampling_and_Undersampling_Techniques_Overview_Study_and_Experimental_Results/links/5ecd393d299bf1c67d1db423/Machine-Learning-with-Oversampling-and-Undersampling-Techniques-Overview-Study-and-Experimental-Results.pdf,0,0,0

When the signal is more complex. especially noisy signal. the component signal is forced to decompose into several incomplete components by LCD and SSA. In addition. the wavelet transform and EEMD need user-defined parameters. and they are very sensitive to the parameters. Therefore. a new signal decomposition algorithm. symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD). is proposed in this paper to decompose a time series into a set of independent mode components.

However. for early gear fault vibration signals. SGMD has two shortcomings. On the one hand. SGMD directly reconstructs the trajectory matrix through the original time series. which may cause the weak fault features submerged in global time series. Therefore. add a slip window to preprocess the original time series. On the other hand. the symplectic geometry components (SGCs) with low energy and fault feature information are eliminated for denoise. Therefore. variable entropy (VE) weighting is proposed to obtain the weighted symplectic geometry components (WSGCs) containing the vast majority of fault feature information.

For learning robust person features. the pose variation of person images is one of the key challenges. Existing works targeting the problem either perform human alignment. or learn human-region-based representations. Extra pose information and computational cost is generally required for inference. To solve this issue. a Feature Distilling Generative Adversarial Network (FD-GAN) is proposed for learning identity-related and pose-unrelated representations. It is a novel framework based on a Siamese structure with multiple novel discriminators on human poses and identities. In addition to the discriminators. a novel same-pose loss is also integrated. which requires appearance of a same person's generated images to be similar. After learning pose-unrelated person features with pose guidance. no auxiliary pose information and additional computational cost is required during testing.

1282131,Face detection and facial expression recognition using moment invariants,2012,Ali Karaali,,,,,,One of the other important problems of computer vision and image processing is recognition of human emotions from facial expressions. Although emotions are recognized by humans easily. it is not that easy using computer vision and image processing algorithms. In this thesis. we proposed two facial expression recognition algorithms. The first algorithm is a rotation invariant facial expression recognition method using Zernike moment invariants. We used a sparse representation-based classifier to discriminate the facial expressions. The system is fully automatic. person independent and can recognize six different facial expressions. In the second algorithm; we show that the sparse representation of expressive facial images from a basis set of neutral face images can be utilized in facial expression recognition. The method consists of face v and facial expression recognition parts and uses a two stages sparse representation-based classifier. In the first part of this method. residual images are obtained during the face recognition step which contains the facial expression related components of the expressive face mostly. and then the expression in the residual images are classified using a difference image dictionary.

1282132,Spatially varying defocus blur estimation and applications,2017,Ali Karaali,,,,,,This dissertation presents two different defocus blur estimation methods for still images. Both methods assume a Gaussian Point Spread Function (PSF) and explore the ratio of gradient magnitudes of reblurred images computed at edge location with different scales. which provides a closed form mathematical formulation for the local blur assuming continuous-time signals. The first approach computes 1D profiles along edge points orthogonal to the local contour. and evaluate the location of the edge (maximum of the derivative) to adaptively select the number of reblurring scales. Considering the time consumption of exploring 1D oriented edge profiles. a second method was proposed based on 2D multiscale image gradients. and local reblurring parameters were selected based on the agreement of an edge detector computed at several scales. Given an initial estimate of the blur scale at edge locations provided by either of these two methods. a correction step that accounts for the discretization of the continuous formulation is also proposed. A novel local filtering method that smooths the refined estimates along the image contours is also proposed. and a fast joint domain filter is explored to propagate blur information to the whole image to generate the full blur map. Experimental results on synthetic and real images show that the proposed methods have promising results for defocus blur estimation. with a good trade off between running time and accuracy when compared to state-of-the art defocus blur estimation methods. To deal with blurry video sequences. temporal consistency was also included in the proposed model.  More precisely.

1282133,The impact of reduced video quality on visual speech recognition,2018,Laura Dungan and Ali Karaali and Naomi Harte,,,,2560-2564,IEEE,Speech recognition technology has become widespread in recent years to the point where almost anyone with a laptop or mobile device has access to it. Despite this. it still poses the problem of poor recognition in noisy environments. Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) provides a possible solution to this problem as the visual channel is not affected by the acoustic noise. However there are other factors that could impact the performance. namely poor quality of the video footage. This aspect of the visual side of speech recognition in noise is less explored. partially due to a lack of large. publicly available. high quality audio-visual continuous-speech databases. Fortunately. these problems can now be considered more fully with the availability of datasets such as TCD-TIMIT. In this paper. we explore the impact of the following visual degradations on visual speech recognition: white Gaussian noise.

1282134,Deep Multi-Scale Feature Learning for Defocus Blur Estimation,2020,Ali Karaali and Naomi Harte and Claudio Rosito Jung,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.11939,,,,This paper presents an edge-based defocus blur estimation method from a single defocused image. We first distinguish edges that lie at depth discontinuities (called depth edges. for which the blur estimate is ambiguous) from edges that lie at approximately constant depth regions (called pattern edges. for which the blur estimate is well-defined). Then. we estimate the defocus blur amount at pattern edges only. and explore an interpolation scheme based on guided filters that prevents data propagation across the detected depth edges to obtain a dense blur map with well-defined object boundaries. Both tasks (edge classification and blur estimation) are performed by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that share weights to learn meaningful local features from multi-scale patches centered at edge locations. Experiments on naturally defocused images show that the proposed method presents qualitative and quantitative results that outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. with a good compromise between running time and accuracy.,True,AwNEYdcAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11939,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11939,0,0,0

Augmenting speech with the visual channel creates its own challenges. e.g. every person has unique mouth movements. making the generalization of visual models very difficult. This factor motivates our focus on the generalization of speaker-independent (SI) AVSR systems especially in noisy environments by exploiting the visual domain. Specifically. we are the first to explore the visual adaptation of an SI-AVSR system to an unknown and unlabelled speaker. We adapt an AVSR system trained in a source domain to decode samples in a target domain without the need for labels in the target domain. For the domain adaptation of the unknown speaker. we use Coupled Generative Adversarial Networks to automatically learn a joint distribution of multi-domain images.

Photogramm. Remote Sens. Spatial Inf. Sci,3,W4,,Recently. global climate change is one of the biggest challenges in the world. Dense downfall and following catastrophic floods are one of the most destructive natural hazards among all. Consequences do not only risk human life but also cause economical damage. It is critical rapid mapping of flooding for decision making and emergency services in river management. In this study. we apply a multi-temporal change detection analysis to investigate the flooded areas occurred in Edirne province of Turkey. The study area is located at the lower course of Meric River (Evros in Greece or Maritsa in Bulgarian) which is the border between Turkey and Greece. The river basin is dominated by cropland which suffers from strong catastrophic precipitation. This situation cause overflow of capacity of the dams located along the river and serious flooding occur. Due to its dynamic structure the region exposed to heavy flooding in the past. One of the biggest inundations was occurred at 2nd February 2015 which resulted severe devastation in both urban and rural areas. For the analyses of the temporal and spatial dynamics of the disaster we use Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data due to its systematic frequent acquisition.

1282166,Resource Efficient Machine Learning Techniques for Monitoring Repetitive Activities through Wearable Devices in Real-time,2020,Yousef Kowsar,,,,,,Weight training activities have become an inseparable part of an athlete's training to reach their maximum performance. However. at the same time. weight training is considered as the fifth costliest sport in terms of injuries. Studies have shown that monitoring weight training performance is one of the most effective ways of reducing injuries caused by this type of exercise. Given the complexity of weight training exercises. it is a challenge for trainees to know whether they are performing their exercises correctly or not. Considering the fact that incorrect performance of a weight training exercise can result in life-long injuries. which may cost athletes their professional careers. it is of utmost importance to design systems that can detect the incorrect performance of weight training activities.  In this thesis. we motivate the importance of personalised monitoring of weight training performance using wearable devices. We show why current supervised approaches for monitoring weight training routines fail to address the needs of professional athletes. We discuss the emerging need for resource efficient machine learning techniques to monitor weight training activities in real-time. using a wearable device. We then present a novel workflow to detect weight training performance anomalies from observing only the correct performance of an exercise by the trainee. Our workflow motivates two fundamental questions to be addressed in the time series domain:  1- Identifying a trainee's weight training performance from the incoming stream of data generated from wearable devices efficiently and in real-time. 2 Analysing a trainee's weight training performance …,True,y4IDkngAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/258657,,,,,https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/258657/54e8c1fd-ca62-ea11-94b7-0050568d0279_Thesis.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Thus. designing a system that can alert its users. when deviating from a safe margin during their exercise routine has been the focus of recent studies. The first step for such a system is to identify what exercise the user is performing. Tangibility of motion sensors through most sport gadgets. where users can easily purchase an off the shelf tool makes them an appealing solution for alerting users. In this project. we aimed to use the data collected through a sport watch worn on the user’s forearm to detect the exercise. We showed how segmentation can help improving the exercise identification task by validating the result through a real world dataset.,True,y4IDkngAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/colloquium/2016/cis-colloquium-2016-proceedings.pdf#page=22,,,,,https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/colloquium/2016/cis-colloquium-2016-proceedings.pdf#page=22,0,0,0

Pillai and Shiwali Mohan,,Ann Arbor: University of Michigan,,1-10,,Electroencephalography (EEG). which contains cortical potentials during various mental processes. can be used to provide neural input signals to activate a brain machine interface (BMI). The effectiveness of such an EEG-based prosthetic system would rely on correct classification of executed motor signals from imagined motor movement signals; an executed motor signal should initiate movement in the artificial limb while signals from motor imagery should be filtered out. This work evaluates the performance of features based on average EEG signal power contained in different frequency bands in order to distinguish between the executed and imagined EEG signals. We also investigate Independent Component Analysis (ICA) as a scheme to remove irrelevant artifacts from the EEG signals. Results demonstrate that using EEG for classification can be performed effectively; however results vary significantly from patient to patient. suggesting that BMI must highly specialized for an individual patient.,True,64ngaD4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,50,https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/past_courses/eecs545f09/projects/MohanPillaiSleight.pdf,15566532546218039777,/scholar?cites=15566532546218039777,,,https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/past_courses/eecs545f09/projects/MohanPillaiSleight.pdf,0,0,0

1282185,Accurate and Efficient Hyperbolic Tangent Activation Function on FPGA using the DCT Interpolation Filter,2016,Ahmed M Abdelsalam and JM Langlois and F Cheriet,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07750,,,,Implementing an accurate and fast activation function with low cost is a crucial aspect to the implementation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on FPGAs. We propose a high-accuracy approximation approach for the hyperbolic tangent activation function of artificial neurons in DNNs. It is based on the Discrete Cosine Transform Interpolation Filter (DCTIF). The proposed architecture combines simple arithmetic operations on stored samples of the hyperbolic tangent function and on input data. The proposed DCTIF implementation achieves two orders of magnitude greater precision than previous work while using the same or fewer computational resources. Various combinations of DCTIF parameters can be chosen to tradeoff the accuracy and complexity of the hyperbolic tangent function. In one case. the proposed architecture approximates the hyperbolic tangent activation function with 10E-5 maximum error while requiring only 1.52 Kbits memory and 57 LUTs of a Virtex-7 FPGA. We also discuss how the activation function accuracy affects the performance of DNNs in terms of their training and testing accuracies. We show that a high accuracy approximation can be necessary in order to maintain the same DNN training and testing performances realized by the exact function.,True,h7U6secAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,9,https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07750,2476130797953518644,/scholar?cites=2476130797953518644,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07750,0,0,0

AMVP block predicts an initial motion vector of the current block from a given set of candidates by means of rate distortion (RD) optimization process. Due to the large number of different-sized blocks. simplification of RD optimization process in AMVP block is highly appreciated. Therefore. we present a new RD optimization technique for AMVP block in HEVC encoder. The proposed RD calculation approach finds the best AMVP candidate by processing less number of feature pixels per every block. Experimental results show notable speedup in terms of AMVP processing time with tolerable quality degradation (PSNR) and bitrate requirement.

One of the modules that contributes to higher compression rates is the Motion Estimation module. which consists of Integer and Fractional pixel motion estimation.

In order to maintain and extend the production growth from such resources. enhanced oil recovery methods must be applied to shale oil reservoirs. Some of earlier studies have confirmed the potential of cyclic gas injection to improve the oil recovery from shale reservoirs.

American Association of Petroleum Geologists. Society of Petroleum Engineers,Recent research into transient reservoir response has developed a novel formulation of the diffusivity equation to model pressure. rate. and production. especially for unconventional reservoirs. This formulation characterizes the geometry of pressure propagation through a reservoir taking into account the heterogeneity of the reservoir and the boundary conditions which arise from multiple fractures and complex well completions. The formulation is derived from the asymptotic (high frequency) limit of the diffusivity equation for the impulse pressure solution. The formulation requires the solution of the Eikonal equation for the Diffusive Time of Flight and the corresponding pore volume geometry contained within a Diffusive Time of Flight contour. Once the pore volume geometry is constructed. it may be used as the basis for either numerical or analytic solutions.

The traditional method of using a predetermined velocity model for event location may be subject to large uncertainties. particularly if the prior velocity model is poor. Our study indicated that microseismic data can help to construct the velocity model. which is usually a major source of uncertainty in microseismic event locations. The simultaneous inversion eliminates the requirement for an accurate predetermined velocity model in microseismic event location estimation.

Pennsylvania. Head waves were used to improve event location accuracy as a substitution for the traditional P-wave polarization method. We identified that resonances due to poor geophone-to-borehole coupling hinder arrival-time picking and contaminate the microseismic data spectrum. The traditional method had substantially greater uncertainty in our data due to the large uncertainty in P-wave polarization direction estimation. We also identified the existence of prominent head waves in some of the data. These head waves are refractions from the interface between the Marcellus Shale and the underlying Onondaga Formation.

Protein phosphorylation is used to regulate various enzyme and receptor activations which include signal pathways. There have been many significant studies conducted to predict phosphorylation sites using various machine learning methods. Recently. several researchers claimed deep learning based methods as the best methods for phosphorylation sited prediction. However. the performance of these methods were backed up with the massive training data used in the researches. In this paper. we study the performance of simple deep neural network on the limited data generally used prior to deep learning employment.

Motivated by their ongoing success in various visual recognition tasks. we build our system upon a state-of-the-art convolutional network. We overcome its closed-set limitations by complementing the network with a series of one-vs-all classifiers that can learn to recognize new semantic classes online. Prior domain knowledge is incorporated by embedding the classification system into a Bayesian filter framework that also ensures temporal coherence. We evaluate the classification accuracy of the system on a robot that maps a variety of places on our campus in real-time. We show how semantic information can boost robotic object detection performance and how the semantic map can be used to modulate the robot's behaviour during navigation tasks.

Current safety inspections are labor intensive and limited by human fallibility. making automation of trip hazard detection appealing from both a safety and economic perspective. Trip hazards present an interesting challenge to modern learning techniques because they are defined as much by affordance as by object type. for example. wires on a table are not a trip hazard. but can be if lying on the ground. To address these challenges. we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the performance characteristics of 11 different colors and depth fusion approaches. including four fusion and one nonfusion approach. using color and two types of depth images.

With the recent significant advances in object detection and scene classification we think the time is right for the SLAM community to ask where the SLAM research should be going during the next years.

1282224,TripNet: Detecting Trip Hazards on Construction Sites,2015,Sean McMahon and Niko Sünderhauf and Michael Milford and Ben Upcroft,,,,,,This paper introduces TripNet. a robotic vision system that detects trip hazards using raw construction site images. Automated detection of dangers such as trip hazards is difficult. Trip hazards are not entirely defined by an object type. rather trip hazards are affordances typically learnt from time consuming intrusive interaction with an environment and its objects. TripNet performs trip hazard identification using only camera imagery and minimal training with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) rapidly fine-tuned on a small corpus of labelled image regions from construction sites. There is no reliance on prior scene segmentation methods during deployment. Trip-Net achieves comparable performance to a human on a dataset recorded in two distinct real world construction sites. TripNet exhibits spatial and temporal generalization by functioning in previously unseen parts of a construction site and over time periods of several weeks. The dataset is published to stimulate further research in this area. This research is a significant step towards automating detection of hazards on construction sites. where a substantial proportion of all workplace related injuries occur.,True,ma3UADgAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC,2,https://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2015/papers/pap158.pdf,16906860150154549705,/scholar?cites=16906860150154549705,,,https://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2015/papers/pap158.pdf,0,0,0

This research investigates an approach to mitigate these risks by visually detecting hazards common to these environments. with particular focus on hazards in mine sites. In addition to their practical appeal. hazards present an interesting challenge as they are defined by their affordance type as much as object type. with rocks only becoming a rubble hazard when on or near the road. Utilising the advantages of transfer learning. we fine-tune the CNN Re-fineNet which performs semantic segmentation to detect water/puddle. snow. rubble and dropoff edge hazard affordances on our small custom datasets. This transfer learning approach is then expanded with two key investigations; first through a series multi-hazard training schemes. and then by evaluating how performance is affected by even smaller training sets. Overall. the multi-hazard training schemes show that training with two hazards gives improved results. while three to four are too general to improve performance on any one task. Through evaluating how performance is affected with less training data. we establish that reasonable hazard detection rates can be achieved with only 10-12 training images. These insights aim to provide practical approaches for others to rapidly prototype CNNs for custom applications.

The major challenge of detecting these trips is the large number of objects capable of becoming hazards. This challenge is exacerbated because these hazards are not entirely defined by their object type. for example tools on the ground are trippable but not when hung on a wall. We propose to train a CNN performing pixel-wise trip detection with three auxiliary tasks to help the CNN better infer scene geometric properties of trip hazards. Of the three approaches investigated pixel-wise ground plane estimation. pixel depth estimation and pixel height above ground plane estimation. the first approach allowed the trip detector to achieve a 11.1% increase in Trip IOU over earlier work. These new approaches make it plausible to deploy a robotic platform to perform trip hazard detection. and so potentially reduce the number of injuries on construction sites.,True,ma3UADgAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,0,https://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2017/papers/pap104s1-file1.pdf,,,,,https://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2017/papers/pap104s1-file1.pdf,0,0,0

1282233,Bearing Fault Diagnosis under Variable Rotational Speeds Using Stockwell Transform-Based Vibration Imaging and Transfer Learning,2018,Md Junayed Hasan and Jong-Myon Kim,8,Applied Sciences,12,,MDPI,In this paper. discrete orthonormal Stockwell transform (DOST)-based vibration imaging is proposed as a preprocessing step for supporting load and rotational speed invariant scenarios for signals of various health conditions. For any health condition. features can easily be extracted from its generated health pattern. To automate the feature selection process. a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based transfer learning (TL) approach for diagnosis has also been introduced. Transfer learning allows an established model to use feature knowledge obtained under one set of working conditions through hidden layers to diagnose faults that occur under other working conditions. The network learns from the massive source dataset. and that knowledge is applied to the target data to identify faults. Using the bearing dataset of Case Western Reserve University. the proposed approach yields an average 99.8% classification accuracy and. specifically. 99.99% for healthy condition (HC). 99.95% for inner race fault (IRF). 99.96% for ball fault (BF). 99.68% for outer race fault for 12 o’clock sensor position ([email protected]). 99.93% for outer race fault for 3 o’clock sensor position ([email protected]). and 99.89% for outer race fault for 6 o’clock sensor position ([email protected]).

1282234,Fault Detection of a Spherical Tank Using a Genetic Algorithm-Based Hybrid Feature Pool and k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm,2019,Md Junayed Hasan and Jong-Myon Kim,12,Energies,06,,MDPI,Fault detection in metallic structures requires a detailed and discriminative feature pool creation mechanism to develop an effective condition monitoring system. Traditional fault detection methods incorporate handcrafted features either from the time. frequency or time-frequency domains. To explore the salient information provided by the acoustic emission (AE) signals. a hybrid of feature pool creation and an optimal features subset selection mechanism is proposed for crack detection in a spherical tank. The optimal hybrid feature pool creation process is composed of two major parts:(1) extraction of statistical features from time and frequency domains. as well as extraction of traditional features associated with the AE signals; and (2) genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimal features subset selection. The optimal features subset is then provided to the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to distinguish between normal (NC) and crack conditions (CC). Experimental results show that the proposed approach yields an average 99.8% accuracy for heath state classification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. it is compared to conventional non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques. as well as those without feature selection schemes. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms conventional non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques. achieving at least 2.55% higher classification accuracy.

In this study. a multi-domain hybrid feature pool is designed to identify most of the important information from the signal. The hybrid feature pool contains features from two types of analysis:(a) statistical parametric analysis from the time domain. and (b) wavelet-based bandwidth specific feature analysis from the time-frequency domain. Then. a wrapper-based feature selector. Boruta. is applied for ranking all the relevant features from that feature pool instead of considering only the non-redundant features.

1282239,Health State Classification of a Spherical Tank Using a Hybrid Bag of Features and K-Nearest Neighbor,2020,Md Junayed Hasan and Jaeyoung Kim and Cheol Hong Kim and Jong-Myon Kim,10,Applied Sciences,7,2525,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Feature analysis puts a great impact in determining the various health conditions of mechanical vessels. To achieve balance between traditional feature extraction and the automated feature selection process. a hybrid bag of features (HBoF) is designed for multiclass health state classification of spherical tanks in this paper. The proposed HBoF is composed of (a) the acoustic emission (AE) features and (b) the time and frequency based statistical features. A wrapper-based feature chooser algorithm. Boruta. is utilized to extract the most intrinsic feature set from HBoF. The selective feature matrix is passed to the multi-class k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to differentiate among normal condition (NC) and two faulty conditions (FC1 and FC2). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology generates an average 99.7% accuracy for all working conditions. Moreover. it outperforms the existing state-of-art works by achieving at least 19.4%.

The objective of the signal-to-imaging technique is to convert one-dimensional (1D) acoustic emission (AE) signals from multiple sensors into a two-dimensional (2D) image to capture information under variable operating conditions. In this process. a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is first applied to the AE signal of each sensor. and the STFT results from the different sensors are then fused to obtain a condition-invariant 2D image of cracks; this scheme is denoted as Multi-Sensors Fusion-based Time-Frequency Imaging (MSFTFI). The MSFTFI images are subsequently fed to the fine-tuned transfer learning (FTL) model built on a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for diagnosing crack types.

1282241,A Multitask-Aided Transfer Learning-Based Diagnostic Framework for Bearings under Inconsistent Working Conditions,2020,Md Junayed Hasan and Muhammad Sohaib and Jong-Myon Kim,20,Sensors,24,7205,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Rolling element bearings are a vital part of rotating machines and their sudden failure can result in huge economic losses as well as physical causalities. Popular bearing fault diagnosis techniques include statistical feature analysis of time. frequency. or time-frequency domain data. These engineered features are susceptible to variations under inconsistent machine operation due to the non-stationary. non-linear. and complex nature of the recorded vibration signals. To address these issues. numerous deep learning-based frameworks have been proposed in the literature. However. the logical reasoning behind crack severities and the longer training times needed to identify multiple health characteristics at the same time still pose challenges. Therefore. in this work. a diagnosis framework is proposed that uses higher-order spectral analysis and multitask learning (MTL). while also incorporating transfer learning (TL). The idea is to first preprocess the vibration signals recorded from a bearing to look for distinct patterns for a given fault type under inconsistent working conditions. eg. variable motor speeds and loads. multiple crack severities. compound faults. and ample noise. Later. these bispectra are provided as an input to the proposed MTL-based convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify the speed and the health conditions. simultaneously. Finally. the TL-based approach is adopted to identify bearing faults in the presence of multiple crack severities. The proposed diagnostic framework is evaluated on several datasets and the experimental results are compared with several state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques to validate the superiority of …,True,6dp1PZAAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC,3,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/24/7205,17063333086483201711,/scholar?cites=17063333086483201711,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/24/7205/pdf,0,0,0

1282242,Sleep State Classification Using Power Spectral Density and Residual Neural Network with Multichannel EEG Signals,2020,Md Junayed Hasan and Dongkoo Shon and Kichang Im and Hyun-Kyun Choi and Dae-Seung Yoo and Jong-Myon Kim,10,Applied Sciences,21,7639,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper proposes a classification framework for automatic sleep stage detection in both male and female human subjects by analyzing the electroencephalogram (EEG) data of polysomnography (PSG) recorded for three regions of the human brain. ie. the pre-frontal. central. and occipital lobes. Without considering any artifact removal approach. the residual neural network (ResNet) architecture is used to automatically learn the distinctive features of different sleep stages from the power spectral density (PSD) of the raw EEG data. The residual block of the ResNet learns the intrinsic features of different sleep stages from the EEG data while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. The proposed approach is validated using the sleep dataset of the Dreams database. which comprises of EEG signals for 20 healthy human subjects. 16 female and 4 male. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ResNet based approach in identifying different sleep stages in both female and male subjects compared to state-of-the-art methods with classification accuracies of 87.8% and 83.7%. respectively.

In the insect olfactory system. second order projection neurons target both the mushroom body. required for learning. and the lateral horn (LH). proposed to mediate innate olfactory behavior. Mushroom body neurons form a sparse olfactory population code. which is not stereotyped across animals. In contrast. odor coding in the LH remains poorly understood. We combine genetic driver lines. anatomical and functional criteria to show that the Drosophila LH has ~1400 neurons and >165 cell types. Genetically labeled LHNs have stereotyped odor responses across animals and on average respond to three times more odors than single projection neurons. LHNs are better odor categorizers than projection neurons. likely due to stereotyped pooling of related inputs.

Little work has been done to understand the potential mimicry of the SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV. and MERS-CoV spike proteins. particularly the receptor-binding motifs. which could be important in determining tropism of the virus. Here. we use structural bioinformatics software to characterize potential mimicry of the three coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding motifs. We utilize sequence-independent alignment tools to compare structurally known or predicted three-dimensional protein models with the receptor-binding motifs and verify potential mimicry with protein docking simulations. Both human and non-human proteins were found to be similar to all three receptor-binding motifs. Similarity to human proteins may reveal which pathways the spike protein is co-opting. while analogous non-human proteins may indicate shared host interaction partners and overlapping antibody cross-reactivity.

1282250,Message Passing Neural Processes,2020,Ben Day and Cătălina Cangea and Arian R Jamasb and Pietro Liò,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.13895,,,,Neural Processes (NPs) are powerful and flexible models able to incorporate uncertainty when representing stochastic processes. while maintaining a linear time complexity. However. NPs produce a latent description by aggregating independent representations of context points and lack the ability to exploit relational information present in many datasets. This renders NPs ineffective in settings where the stochastic process is primarily governed by neighbourhood rules. such as cellular automata (CA). and limits performance for any task where relational information remains unused. We address this shortcoming by introducing Message Passing Neural Processes (MPNPs). the first class of NPs that explicitly makes use of relational structure within the model. Our evaluation shows that MPNPs thrive at lower sampling rates. on existing benchmarks and newly-proposed CA and Cora-Branched tasks.

It combines an incremental semantic grammar-Dynamic Syntax and Type Theory with Records (DS-TTR)-with Reinforcement Learning (RL). where language generation and dialogue management are a joint decision problem. The systems thus produced are incremental: dialogues are processed word-by-word. shown previously to be essential in supporting natural. spontaneous dialogue. We hypothesised that the rich linguistic knowledge within the grammar should enable a combinatorially large number of dialogue variations to be processed. even when trained on very few dialogues. Our experiments show that our model can process 74% of the Facebook AI bAbI dataset even when trained on only 0.13% of the data (5 dialogues). It can in addition process 65% of bAbI+. a corpus we created by systematically adding incremental dialogue phenomena such as restarts and self-corrections to bAbI.

1282261,Challenging neural dialogue models with natural data: Memory networks fail on incremental phenomena,2017,Igor Shalyminov and Arash Eshghi and Oliver Lemon,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.07840,,,,Natural. spontaneous dialogue proceeds incrementally on a word-by-word basis; and it contains many sorts of disfluency such as mid-utterance/sentence hesitations. interruptions. and self-corrections. But training data for machine learning approaches to dialogue processing is often either cleaned-up or wholly synthetic in order to avoid such phenomena. The question then arises of how well systems trained on such clean data generalise to real spontaneous dialogue. or indeed whether they are trainable at all on naturally occurring dialogue data. To answer this question. we created a new corpus called bAbI+ by systematically adding natural spontaneous incremental dialogue phenomena such as restarts and self-corrections to the Facebook AI Research's bAbI dialogues dataset. We then explore the performance of a state-of-the-art retrieval model. MemN2N. on this more natural dataset. Results show that the semantic accuracy of the MemN2N model drops drastically; and that although it is in principle able to learn to process the constructions in bAbI+. it needs an impractical amount of training data to do so. Finally. we go on to show that an incremental. semantic parser--DyLan--shows 100% semantic accuracy on both bAbI and bAbI+. highlighting the generalisation properties of linguistically informed dialogue models.,True,TVs0lP8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,19,https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07840,14393202976390851500,/scholar?cites=14393202976390851500,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07840,0,0,0

Apart from raw dialogue data. user-provided ratings are the most common signal used to train such systems to produce engaging responses. In this paper we show that social dialogue systems can be trained effectively from raw unannotated data. Using a dataset of real conversations collected in the 2017 Alexa Prize challenge. we developed a neural ranker for selecting'good'system responses to user utterances. ie responses which are likely to lead to long and engaging conversations. We show that (1) our neural ranker consistently outperforms several strong baselines when trained to optimise for user ratings;(2) when trained on larger amounts of data and only using conversation length as the objective. the ranker performs better than the one trained using ratings--ultimately reaching a Precision@ 1 of 0.87.

1282266,Interactional dynamics and the emergence of language games,2017,Arash Eshghi and Igor Shalyminov and Oliver Lemon,,FADLI 2017,,17,,Meaning is highly activity-specific. in that the action that a particular sequence of words is taken to perform is severely underdetermined in the absence of an overarching activity. or a ‘language-game’. In this paper. we combine a formal. incremental model of interactional dynamics and contextual update-Dynamic Syntax and Type Theory with Records (DSTTR)-with Reinforcement Learning for word selection. We show. using an implemented system. that trial and error generation with a DS-TTR lexicon–a process we have dubbed babbling–leads to particular domain-specific dialogue acts to be learned and routinised over time; and thus that higher level dialogue structures-or how actions fit together to form a coherent whole-can be learned in this fashion. This method therefore allows incremental dialogue systems to be automatically bootstrapped from small amounts of unannotated dialogue transcripts. yet capturing a combinatorially large number of interactional variations. Even when the system is trained from only a single dialogue. we show that it supports over 8000 new dialogues in the same domain.

Data-driven dialogue system development has to be adapted to meet this requirement---therefore. reducing the amount of data and annotations necessary for training such systems is a central research problem.In this paper. we present the Dialogue Knowledge Transfer Network (DiKTNet). a state-of-the-art approach to goal-oriented dialogue generation which only uses a few example dialogues (ie few-shot learning). none of which has to be annotated. We achieve this by performing a 2-stage training. Firstly. we perform unsupervised dialogue representation pre-training on a large source of goal-oriented dialogues in multiple domains. the MetaLWOz corpus.

Processing such phenomena is essential in understanding a speaker's intended meaning and controlling the flow of the conversation. Furthermore. this processing needs to be word-by-word incremental to allow further downstream processing to begin as early as possible in order to handle real spontaneous human conversational behaviour.In addition. from a developer's point of view. it is highly desirable to be able to develop systems which can be trained fromclean'examples while also able to generalise to the very diverse disfluent variations on the same data--thereby enhancing both data-efficiency and robustness.

1282271,Exploiting superior CNN-based iris segmentation for better recognition accuracy,2019,Heinz Hofbauer and Ehsaneddin Jalilian and Andreas Uhl,120,Pattern Recognition Letters,,17-23,Elsevier,CNN-based iris segmentations have been proven to be superior to traditional iris segmentation techniques in terms of segmentation error metrics. To properly utilize them in a traditional biometric recognition systems requires a parameterization of the iris. based on the generated segmentation. to obtain the normalised iris texture typically used for feature extraction. This is an unsolved problem. We will introduce a method to parameterize CNN based segmentation. bridging the gap between CNN based segmentation and the rubbersheet-transform. The parameterization enables the CNN segmentation as full segmentation step in any regular iris biometric system. or alternatively the segmentation can be utilized as a noise mask for other segmentation methods.

Training these networks. however. normally requires plenty of labeled data. while data labeling is an expensive and time-consuming task. due to the significant human effort involved. In this paper we propose two pixel-level domain adaptation methods. introducing a training model for CNN based iris segmentation. Based on our experiments. the proposed methods can effectively transfer the domains of source databases to those of the targets. producing new adapted databases. The adapted databases then are used to train CNNs for segmentation of iris texture in the target databases. eliminating the need for the target labeled data.

Using the annotations. a deep learning pipeline was developed to localize scleral spur. center the AS-OCT B-scans and segment the detached graft sections. Detachment segmentation model performance was evaluated per B-scan by comparing (1) length of detachment and (2) horizontal projection of the detached sections with the expert annotations. Horizontal projections were used to construct graft detachment maps. All final evaluations were done on a test set that was set apart during training of the models. A second DMEK expert annotated the test set to determine interrater performance.Results: Mean scleral spur localization error was 0.155 mm. whereas the interrater difference was 0.090 mm. The estimated graft detachment lengths were in 69% of the cases within a 10-pixel (∼ 150 µm) difference from the ground truth (77% for the second DMEK expert). Dice scores for the horizontal projections of all B-scans with detachments were 0.896 and 0.880 for our model and the second DMEK expert. respectively.Conclusions: Our deep learning model can be used to automatically and instantly localize graft detachment in AS-OCT B-scans.

Restricted budgets require prioritization of the development of these technologies. We aim to provide vascular surgeons with a structured methodology to incorporate possibly conflicting criteria in prioritizing the development of new technologies. We propose a multi-criteria decision analysis framework to evaluate the value of innovative technologies for the HOT based on the MACBETH methodology. The framework is applied to a specific case: the new HOT in a large teaching hospital. Three upcoming innovations are scored for three different endovascular procedures. Two vascular surgeons scored the expected performance of these innovations for each of the procedures on six performance criteria and weighed the importance of these criteria.

Wiesbaden,Open gantry C-arm systems that are placed within the interventional room enable 3-D imaging and guidance for stroke therapy without patient transfer. This can profit in drastically reduced time-totherapy. however. due to the interventional setting. the data acquisition is comparatively slow. Thus. involuntary patient motion needs to be estimated and compensated to achieve high image quality. Patient motion results in a misalignment of the geometry and the acquired image data. Consistency measures can be used to restore the correct mapping to compensate the motion.

Geometric information within this process is usually depending on the system setting only. i.e.. the scanner position or readout direction. Patient motion therefore corrupts the geometry alignment in the reconstruction process resulting in motion artifacts. We propose an appearance learning approach recognizing the structures of rigid motion independently from the scanned object.

Cham,Scattered radiation is a major concern impacting X-ray image-guided procedures in two ways. First. back-scatter significantly contributes to patient (skin) dose during complicated interventions. Second. forward-scattered radiation reduces contrast in projection images and introduces artifacts in 3-D reconstructions. While conventionally employed anti-scatter grids improve image quality by blocking X-rays. the additional attenuation due to the anti-scatter grid at the detector needs to be compensated for by a higher patient entrance dose. This also increases the room dose affecting the staff caring for the patient. For skin dose quantification. back-scatter is usually accounted for by applying pre-determined scalar back-scatter factors or linear point spread functions to a primary kerma forward projection onto a patient surface point.

In this work. we develop a method to address these issues with semi-supervised learning in regression tasks (eg. translation from source to target). Our model uses adversarial signals to learn from unpaired datapoints. and imposes a cycle-loss reconstruction error penalty to regularize mappings in either direction against one another. We first evaluate our method on synthetic experiments. demonstrating two primary advantages of the system: 1) distribution matching via the adversarial loss and 2) regularization towards invertible mappings via the cycle loss. We then show a regularization effect and improved performance when paired data is supplemented by additional unpaired data on two real biomedical regression tasks: estimating the physiological effect of medical treatments. and extrapolating gene expression (transcriptomics) signals. Our proposed technique is a promising initial step towards more robust use of adversarial signals in semi-supervised regression. and could be useful for other tasks (eg. causal inference or modality translation) in the biomedical field.,True,kZbMvLwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,15,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11890,3872450682325693373,/scholar?cites=3872450682325693373,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/11890/11749,0,0,0

This paper contributes a first approach toward enforcing formal safety constraints on end-to-end policies with visual inputs. Our approach draws on recent advances in object detection and automated reasoning for hybrid dynamical systems. The approach is evaluated on a novel benchmark that emphasizes the challenge of safely exploring in the presence of hard constraints. Our benchmark draws from several proposed problem sets for safe learning and includes problems that emphasize challenges such as reward signals that are not aligned with safety constraints. On each of these benchmark problems. our algorithm completely avoids unsafe behavior while remaining competitive at optimizing for as much reward as is safe. We also prove that our method of enforcing the safety constraints preserves all safe policies from the original environment.,True,kZbMvLwAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01223,13081863451806659544,/scholar?cites=13081863451806659544,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01223,0,0,0

This provides evidence-based support for critically understanding ECG monitoring systems’ components. contexts. features. and challenges. Hence. a generic architectural model for ECG monitoring systems is proposed. an extensive analysis of ECG monitoring systems’ value chain is conducted. and a thorough review of the relevant literature. classified against the experts’ taxonomy. is presented. highlighting challenges and current trends.

A key ingredient of our approach is Pedestrian Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance. a pedestrian motion prediction model that accounts for both a pedestrian's global navigation intention and local interactions with the vehicle and other pedestrians. Unfortunately. the autonomous vehicle does not know the pedestrians' intentions a priori and requires a planning algorithm that hedges against the uncertainty in pedestrian intentions. Our planning system combines a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process algorithm with the pedestrian motion model and runs in real time.

1282336,LeTS-Drive: Driving in a Crowd by Learning from Tree Search,2019,Panpan Cai and Yuanfu Luo and Aseem Saxena and David Hsu and Wee Sun Lee,,,,,,Autonomous driving in a crowded environment. eg. a busy traffic intersection. is an unsolved challenge for robotics. The robot vehicle must contend with a dynamic and partially observable environment. noisy sensors. and many agents. A principled approach is to formalize it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and solve it through online belief-tree search. To handle a large crowd and achieve real-time performance in this very challenging setting. we propose LeTS-Drive. which integrates online POMDP planning and deep learning. It consists of two phases. In the offline phase. we learn a policy and the corresponding value function by imitating the belief tree search. In the online phase. the learned policy and value function guide the belief tree search. LeTS-Drive leverages the robustness of planning and the runtime efficiency of learning to enhance the performance of both. Experimental results in simulation show that LeTS-Drive outperforms either planning or imitation learning alone and develops sophisticated driving skills.,True,cU00dB0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,7,https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12197,4920266144831062855,/scholar?cites=4920266144831062855,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12197,0,0,0

In this paper. we propose an approach to automatically recognize the concept of a vocal imitation. and then retrieve sounds of this concept. Because different acoustic aspects (e.g.. pitch. loudness. timbre) are emphasized in imitating different sounds. a key challenge in vocal imitation recognition is to extract appropriate features. Hand-crafted features may not work well for a large variety of imitations. Instead. we use a stacked auto-encoder to automatically learn features from a set of vocal imitations in an unsupervised way. Then. a multi-class SVM is trained for sound concepts of interest using their training imitations.

This can be problematic as labels may be missing. irrelevant to the audio content. or not known by users. Query by vocal imitation lets users query using vocal imitations instead.

1282346,Supervised and unsupervised sound retrieval by vocal imitation,2016,Yichi Zhang and Zhiyao Duan,64,Journal of the Audio Engineering Society,7/8,533-543,Audio Engineering Society,Existing methods to index and search audio documents are generally based on text metadata and text-based search engines. but this approach is often problematic and time consuming because the text label does not necessarily describe the audio content. Query by Example (QBE) is an alternative approach for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of sound retrieval. In this research. the authors propose a novel approach for sound query by vocal imitation. Vocal imitation is commonly used in human communication and can be employed for human-computer interaction. Two proposals are suggested:(1) a supervised system that trains a multiclass classifier using training vocal imitations of different sound classes in the library and classifies a new imitation query into one of the classes;(2) an unsupervised system that is more flexible because it measures the feature distance between the imitation query and each …,True,7fgM1xwAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,11,https://www.aes.org/e-lib/online/browse.cfm?elib=18339,13138846486288118744,/scholar?cites=13138846486288118744,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5959/ff189dbe62f9a14d55e5f3bd7dc4e0436f0f.pdf,0,0,0

In its simplest form. such an evaluation can be performed by manually verifying whether there is any consistent identifiable visual concept distinguishing between positive and negative exemplars labelled by an attribute. This manual checking is tedious. expensive and labour intensive. In addition. comparisons between different methods could also be problematic as it is not clear how one could quantitatively decide which attribute is more meaningful than the others.

1282364,Automatic image attribute selection for zero-shot learning of object categories,2014,Liangchen Liu and Arnold Wiliem and Shaokang Chen and Brian C Lovell,,,,2619-2624,IEEE,Recently the use of image attributes as image descriptors has drawn great attention. This is because the resulting descriptors extracted using these attributes are human understandable as well as machine readable. Although the image attributes are generally semantically meaningful. they may not be discriminative. As such. prior works often consider a discriminative learning approach that could discover discriminative attributes. Nevertheless. the resulting learned attributes could lose their semantic meaning. To that end. in the present work. we study two properties of attributes: discriminative power and reliability. We then propose a novel greedy algorithm called Discriminative and Reliable Attribute Learning (DRAL) which selects a subset of attributes which maximises an objective function incorporating the two properties.

Despite the progress made. most methods consider the supervised scenario which assumes the existence of labelled data. Recent results suggest that it is possible to discover attributes from a set of unlabelled data. In this work. we propose a novel unsupervised attribute discovery method utilising multi-graph approach that preserves both local neighbourhood structure as well as class separability. Whilst. the local neighbourhood structure is preserved by considering multiple similarity graphs. the class separability is achieved by incorporating the traditional clustering objective. For evaluation. we first investigate the performance of the proposed approach to address a clustering task.

The increasing integration of DR and renewable energy bring challenging issues for energy policy makers. and electricity market regulators in the power grid. In this paper. a new two-stage stochastic game model is introduced to operate the electricity market. where Stochastic Stackelberg-Cournot-Nash (SSCN) equilibrium is applied to characterize the optimal energy bidding strategy of the forward market and the optimal energy trading strategy of the spot market. The sampling average approximation (SAA) technique is harnessed to address the stochastic game model in a distributed way. By this game model. the participation ratio of demand response can be significantly increased while the unreliability of power system caused by renewable energy resources can be considerably reduced.

However. even the most simplest form of the generated sentence. the SVO triplet (Subject/Verb/Object). can be misleading for its lack of role relationship analysis.

In this paper. we explore role relationships between objects/persons and their usage in generating a more meaningful video description.

Keywords or attributes are generally chosen manually based on expert knowledge of surveillance. Most existing works primarily aim at either supervised learning approaches relying on extensive manual labelling or hierarchical probabilistic models that assume the features are extracted using the bag-of-words approach; thus limiting the utilization of the other features. To address this. we turn our attention to automatic attribute discovery approaches. However. it is not clear which automatic discovery approach can discover the most meaningful attributes.

It is estimated at about 60% of all deaths worldwide and approximately 43% of the global burden of chronic diseases. Thus. the analysis of the healthcare data has helped health officials. patients. and healthcare communities to perform early detection for those diseases. Extracting the patterns from healthcare data has helped the healthcare communities to obtain complete medical data for the purpose of diagnosis. The objective of the present research work is presented to improve the surveillance detection system for chronic diseases. which is used for the protection of people’s lives. For this purpose. the proposed system has been developed to enhance the detection of chronic disease by using machine learning algorithms. The standard data related to chronic diseases have been collected from various worldwide resources. In healthcare data. special chronic diseases include ambiguous objects of the class. Therefore. the presence of ambiguous objects shows the availability of traits involving two or more classes. which reduces the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. The novelty of the current research work lies in the assumption that demonstrates the noncrisp Rough K-means (RKM) clustering for figuring out the ambiguity in chronic disease dataset to improve the performance of the system.

1282383,Water Quality Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence Algorithms,2020,Theyazn HH Aldhyani and Mohammed Al-Yaari and Hasan Alkahtani and Mashael Maashi,2020,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,,,Hindawi,During the last years. water quality has been threatened by various pollutants. Therefore. modeling and predicting water quality have become very important in controlling water pollution. In this work. advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are developed to predict water quality index (WQI) and water quality classification (WQC). For the WQI prediction. artificial neural network models. namely nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm. have been developed. In addition. three machine learning algorithms. namely. support vector machine (SVM). -nearest neighbor (K-NN). and Naive Bayes. have been used for the WQC forecasting. The used dataset has 7 significant parameters. and the developed models were evaluated based on some statistical parameters. The results revealed that the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality according to superior robustness. Prediction results demonstrated that the NARNET model performed slightly better than the LSTM for the prediction of the WQI values and the SVM algorithm has achieved the highest accuracy (97.01%) for the WQC prediction. Furthermore. the NARNET and LSTM models have achieved similar accuracy for the testing phase with a slight difference in the regression coefficient ( and ).

However. finding the combat model parameters satisfying the required combat power using simulation can take a long time for two reasons: (1) the prolonged execution time per simulation run and (2) the enormous number of simulation runs. This paper proposes a simulation-based optimization method for the SoS-based simulation model to overcome these problems. The method consists of two processes: (1) the transformation of the SoS-based model into an integrated model using the neural network to reduce the execution time and (2) the optimization of the integrated model using the genetic algorithm with ranking and selection to decrease the number of simulation runs.

Dynamical behavior of SoS is represented by a composition of behaviors of component systems. Thus. a M&S tool/environment would not be efficient for development of heterogeneous models nor for simulation in a centralized environment. Moreover. such an environment restricts reusability and composability. This paper presents an interoperation method for M&S of defense systems as SoS. The approach first develops component system models using tools. each specialized to M&S of each component system. It then interoperates such simulations together to simulate a whole system as SoS.

With these concepts. this paper centers on three ideas: 1) two models' structure which are the Behavioral-Fidelity Interchangeable Model (B-FIM) and the Executional-Fidelity Interchangeable Model (E-FIM). 2) modeling formalism. and 3) a simulation algorithm to support them.

Despite model size reduction. achieving performance enhancement on devices is. however. still challenging mainly due to the irregular representations of sparse matrix formats. This paper proposes a new weight representation scheme for Sparse Quantized Neural Networks. specifically achieved by fine-grained and unstructured pruning method. The representation is encrypted in a structured regular format. which can be efficiently decoded through XOR-gate network during inference in a parallel manner. We demonstrate various deep learning models that can be compressed and represented by our proposed format with fixed and high compression ratio.

Computations using sparse matrices obtained by pruning parameters. however. exhibit vastly different parallelism depending on the index representation scheme. As a result. fine-grained pruning has not gained much attention due to its irregular index form leading to large memory footprint and low parallelism for convolutions and matrix multiplications. In this paper. we propose a new network pruning technique that generates a low-rank binary index matrix to compress index data while decompressing index data is performed by simple binary matrix multiplication. This proposed compression method finds a particular fine-grained pruning mask that can be decomposed into two binary matrices. We also propose a tile-based factorization technique that not only lowers memory requirements but also enhances compression ratio.

For execution of DEVS. we need an execution environment. which consists of simulation engine and models interpreted by the simulation engine. Common existing environments use hierarchical scheduling algorithm for DEVS execution. This hierarchical scheduling is a proper algorithm for DEVS execution because of hierarchical and modular characteristics. But this algorithm has overheads owing to message passing and time management. To overcome these overheads. we apply event-oriented simulation to DEVS execution and we remove hierarchical overheads. In eventoriented simulation. the scheduling of model execution is performed by events and event list.

Correspondingly. the amount of computations and required memory footprint increase as well. Quantization is an efficient method to address such concerns by compressing DNNs such that computations can be simplified while required storage footprint is significantly reduced. Unfortunately. commercial CPUs and GPUs do not fully support quantization because only fixed data transfers (such as 32 bits) are allowed. As a result. even if weights are quantized into a few bits. CPUs and GPUs cannot access multiple quantized weights without memory bandwidth waste. Success of quantization in practice. hence. relies on an efficient computation engine design. especially for matrix multiplication that is a basic computation engine in most DNNs. In this paper. we propose a novel matrix multiplication method. called BiQGEMM. dedicated to quantized DNNs. BiQGEMM can access multiple quantized weights simultaneously in one instruction. In addition. BiQGEMM pre-computes intermediate results that are highly redundant when quantization leads to limited available computation space. Since pre-computed values are stored in lookup tables and reused. BiQGEMM achieves lower amount of overall computations. Our extensive experimental results show that BiQGEMM presents higher performance than conventional schemes when DNNs are quantized.,True,8eTxKOkAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09904,15876507794979923933,/scholar?cites=15876507794979923933,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09904,0,0,0

By preserving the original model structure. 2-dimensional low-rank approximation demanding lowering (such as im2col) is available in our proposed scheme.

In this paper. we propose a novel framework by learning high-order relation and topology information for discriminative features and robust alignment. At first. we use a CNN backbone to learn feature maps and key-points estimation model to extract semantic local features. Even so. occluded images still suffer from occlusion and outliers. Then. we view the extracted local features of an image as nodes of a graph and propose an adaptive direction graph convolutional (ADGC) layer to pass relation information between nodes. The proposed ADGC layer can automatically suppress the message passing of meaningless features by dynamically learning direction and degree of linkage. When aligning two groups of local features. we view it as a graph matching problem and propose a cross-graph embedded-alignment (CGEA) layer to joint learn and embed topology information to local features. and straightly predict similarity score.

In real-world applications. the domain of a few or all attributes of the data set may be continuous. These continuous attributes need to be discretized as a pre-processing step to attribute reduction. In this paper. we have proposed an algorithm to the problem of attribute reduction on continuous data in rough set theory. The proposed algorithm does not need any extra information or expert domain knowledge apart from the continuous data set. The proposed algorithm is based on the concepts of rough set theory.

Discretization before attribute reduction will result in high computation cost as many irrelevant and redundant attributes need to be discretized. Attribute reduction before discretization may result in over-fitting of the data leading to low performance of the induction algorithm.

These neural networks were then tested on a classification task. In particle swarm optimization behaviour of a particle is influenced by the experiential knowledge of the particle as well as socially exchanged information. Particle swarm optimization follows a parallel search strategy. In simulated annealing uphill moves are made in the search space in a stochastic fashion in addition to the downhill moves. Simulated annealing therefore has better scope of escaping local minima and reach a global minimum in the search space. Thus simulated annealing gives a selective randomness to the search. Back propagation algorithm uses gradient descent approach search for minimizing the error. Our goal of global minima in the task being done here is to come to lowest energy state. where energy state is being modelled as the sum of the squares of the error between the target and observed output values for all the training samples. We compared the performance of the neural networks of identical architectures trained by the i) Hybrid particle swarm optimization-simulated annealing. ii) Simulated annealing and iii) Back propagation algorithms respectively on a classification task and noted the results obtained.

However. experimental methods for identifying novel targets of TCM herbs heavily relied on the current available herb-compound-target relationships. In this work. we present an Herb-Target Interaction Network (HTINet) approach. a novel network integration pipeline for herb-target prediction mainly relying on the symptom related associations. HTINet focuses on capturing the low-dimensional feature vectors for both herbs and proteins by network embedding. which incorporate the topological properties of nodes across multi-layered heterogeneous network. and then performs supervised learning based on these low-dimensional feature representations.

Experimental targets identification of herbs is a difficult and time-consuming work. Computational method for identifying herb targets is an efficient approach. However. how to make full use of heterogeneous network data about herbs and targets to improve the performance of herb targets prediction is still a dilemma.

IHD patients usually hold the symptoms of phlegm-stasis cementation syndrome (PSCS) as significant complications. However. the underlying molecular mechanisms of PSCS complicated with IHD were not fully elucidated. Materials and Methods We utilized network medicine methods to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of IHD phenotypes. Firstly. we integrated high-quality IHD-associated genes from both human curated disease-gene association database and biomedical literatures. Secondly. we obtained the IHD disease modules by dissecting the protein-protein interaction (PPI) topological modules in the String V9.1 database and the mapping of IHD-associated genes to the PPI topological modules. After that. we carried out molecular functional analyses (e.g. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses) for these IHD disease modules. Finally. we identified the PSCS syndrome modules by mapping the PSCS related symptom-genes to the IHD disease modules. which were further validated by both pharmacological and physiological evidences derived from published literatures. Results We integrated and evaluated 1.056 high-quality IHD-associated genes. In addition. we identified eight IHD disease modules (the PPI sub-networks significantly relevant to IHD). in which two disease modules were relevant to PSCS syndrome (i.e. two PSCS syndrome modules). These two modules had enriched pathways on Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (hsa04620) and Renin-angiotensin system (hsa04614). with the molecular …,True,ne2E9rEAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,3,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00007/full,8475741428779909764,/scholar?cites=8475741428779909764,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00007/full,0,0,0

Over the last decade. it has been an open problem as to how best to cluster white matter fibers. extracted from whole-brain tractography. into anatomically meaningful groups. Some existing techniques use region of interest (ROI) based clustering. atlas-based labeling. or unsupervised spectral clustering.

Recent evaluation of representative background subtraction techniques demonstrated that there are still considerable challenges facing these methods. We present a new method in which we regard the image sequence as being made up of the sum of a low-rank background matrix and a dynamic tree-structured sparse outlier matrix and solve the decomposition using our approximated Robust Principal Component Analysis method extended to handle camera motion.

1282455,Approximated robust principal component analysis for improved general scene background subtraction,2016,Salehe Erfanian Ebadi and Valia Guerra Ones and Ebroul Izquierdo,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.05875,,,,The research reported in this paper addresses the fundamental task of separation of locally moving or deforming image areas from a static or globally moving background. It builds on the latest developments in the field of robust principal component analysis. specifically. the recently reported practical solutions for the long-standing problem of recovering the low-rank and sparse parts of a large matrix made up of the sum of these two components. This article addresses a few critical issues including: embedding global motion parameters in the matrix decomposition model. ie. estimation of global motion parameters simultaneously with the foreground/background separation task. considering matrix block-sparsity rather than generic matrix sparsity as natural feature in video processing applications. attenuating background ghosting effects when foreground is subtracted. and more critically providing an extremely efficient algorithm to solve the low-rank/sparse matrix decomposition task. The first aspect is important for background/foreground separation in generic video sequences where the background usually obeys global displacements originated by the camera motion in the capturing process. The second aspect exploits the fact that in video processing applications the sparse matrix has a very particular structure. where the non-zero matrix entries are not randomly distributed but they build small blocks within the sparse matrix. The next feature of the proposed approach addresses removal of ghosting effects originated from foreground silhouettes and the lack of information in the occluded background regions of the image.

The most popular method. called feature frequency profile (FFP-k). finds the frequency distribution for all words of certain length k over the whole genome sequence using (overlapping) windows of the same length. For a satisfactory result. the recommended word length (k) ranges from 6 to 15 and it may not be a multiple of 3 (codon length). The total number of possible words needed for FFP-k can range from 46=4096 to 415. We propose a simple improvement over the popular FFP method using only a typical word length of 3. A new method. called Trinucleotide Usage Profile (TUP). is proposed based only on the (relative) frequency distribution using non-overlapping windows of length 3. The total number of possible words needed for TUP is 43=64. which is much less than the total count for the recommended optimal “resolution” for FFP. To build a phylogenetic tree. we propose first representing each of the species by a TUP vector and then using an appropriate distance measure between pairs of the TUP vectors for the tree construction. In particular. we propose summarizing a DNA sequence by a matrix of three rows corresponding to three reading frames. recording the frequency distribution of the non-overlapping words of length 3 in each of the reading frame. We also provide a numerical measure for comparing trees constructed with various methods.

1282462,Prioritization. clustering and functional annotation of MicroRNAs using latent semantic indexing of MEDLINE abstracts,2016,Sujoy Roy and Brandon C Curry and Behrouz Madahian and Ramin Homayouni,17,,13,131-142,BioMed Central,The amount of scientific information about MicroRNAs (miRNAs) is growing exponentially. making it difficult for researchers to interpret experimental results. In this study. we present an automated text mining approach using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for prioritization. clustering and functional annotation of miRNAs. For approximately 900 human miRNAs indexed in miRBase. text documents were created by concatenating titles and abstracts of MEDLINE citations which refer to the miRNAs. The documents were parsed and a weighted term-by-miRNA frequency matrix was created. which was subsequently factorized via singular value decomposition to extract pair-wise cosine values between the term (keyword) and miRNA vectors in reduced rank semantic space. LSI enables derivation of both explicit and implicit associations between entities based on word usage patterns. Using miR2Disease as a gold standard. we found that LSI identified keyword-to-miRNA relationships with high accuracy. In addition. we demonstrate that pair-wise associations between miRNAs can be used to group them into categories which are functionally aligned. Finally. term ranking by querying the LSI space with a group of miRNAs enabled annotation of the clusters with functionally related terms. LSI modeling of MEDLINE abstracts provides a robust and automated method for miRNA related knowledge discovery. The latest collection of miRNA abstracts and LSI model can be accessed through the web tool miRNA Literature Network (miRLiN) at                      http://bioinfo.memphis.edu/mirlin                                        .,True,xBjGqQoAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,5,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1223-2,1490458816086692700,/scholar?cites=1490458816086692700,,,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1223-2,0,0,0

1282463,A pilot study of demographic and dopaminergic genetic contributions to weight change in kidney transplant recipients,2015,Ansley Stanfill and Donna Hathaway and Ann Cashion and Ramin Homayouni and Patricia Cowan and Carol Thompson and Behrouz Madahian and Yvette Conley,10,PloS one,9,e0138885,Public Library of Science,Kidney transplant recipients often experience a significant amount of weight gain in the first year post-transplantation. While demographic factors such as age. race. and sex have been associated with weight gain in this population. these factors do not explain all of the variability seen. A number of studies have suggested that genetics also plays a critical role in weight changes. Recently. alterations in the activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine have been associated with weight change. and gene expression studies in kidney transplant recipients have supported this association. The purpose of this pilot study is to first examine the feasibility and methodology. and then to examine the associations of age. race. sex. and genotype for 13 SNPs and 3 VNTRs in 9 dopaminergic pathway genes (ANKK1. DRD2. DRD3. DRD4. SLC6A3/DAT1. MAOA. MAOB. COMT. CPE) for associations with percent weight change at 12 months post-transplantation. Seventy kidney transplant recipients had demographic and clinical data collected as a part of a larger observational study. DNA was extracted from repository buffy coat samples taken at the time of transplant. and genotyped using Taqman and PCR based methods. Three SNPs were independently associated with percent weight change: ANKK1 rs1800497 (r = -0.28. p = 0.05). SLC6A3/DAT1 rs6347 (p = 0.046). and CPE rs1946816 (p = 0.028).

1282465,Navigating the functional landscape of transcription factors via non-negative tensor factorization analysis of MeDline abstracts,2017,Sujoy Roy and Daqing Yun and Behrouz Madahian and Michael W Berry and Lih-Yuan Deng and Daniel Goldowitz and Ramin Homayouni,5,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,,48,Frontiers,In this study. we developed and evaluated a novel text-mining approach. using non-negative tensor factorization (NTF). to simultaneously extract and functionally annotate transcriptional modules consisting of sets of genes. transcription factors (TFs). and terms from MEDLINE abstracts. A sparse 3-mode term X gene X TF tensor was constructed that contained weighted frequencies of 106.895 terms in 26.781 abstracts shared amongst 7.695 genes and 994 TFs. The tensor was decomposed into sub-tensors using non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) across 16 different approximation ranks. Dominant entries of each of 2.861 sub-tensors were extracted to form term-gene-TF annotated transcriptional modules (ATMs). More than 94% of the ATMs were found to be enriched in at least one KEGG pathway or GO category. suggesting that the ATMs are functionally relevant. One advantage of this method is that it can discover potentially new gene-TF associations from the literature. Using a set of microarray and ChIP-Seq datasets as gold standard. we show that the precision of our method for predicting gene-TF associations is significantly higher than chance. In addition. we demonstrate that the terms in each ATM can be used to suggest new GO classifications to genes and TFs. Taken together. our results indicate that NTF is useful for simultaneous extraction and functional annotation of transcriptional regulatory networks from unstructured text. as well as for literature based discovery.

1282466,Applying DNA Computation to Error Detection Problem in Rule-Based Systems,2015,Behrouz Madahian and Amin Salighehdar and Reza Amini,7,Journal of Intelligent Learning Systems and Applications,1,21-36,Scientific Research Publishing,As rule-based systems (RBS) technology gains wider acceptance. the need to create and maintain large knowledge bases will assume greater importance. Demonstrating a rule base to be free from error remains one of the obstacles to the adoption of this technology. In the past several years. a vast body of research has been carried out in developing various graphical techniques such as utilizing Petri Nets to analyze structural errors in rule-based systems. which utilize propositional logic. Four typical errors in rule-based systems are redundancy. circularity. incompleteness. and inconsistency. Recently. a DNA-based computing approach to detect these errors has been proposed. That paper presents algorithms which are able to detect structural errors just for special cases. For a rule base. which contains multiple starting nodes and goal nodes. structural errors are not removed correctly by utilizing the algorithms proposed in that paper and algorithms lack generality. In this study algorithms mainly based on Adleman’s operations. which are able to detect structural errors. in any form that they may arise in rule base. are presented. The potential of applying our algorithm is auspicious giving the operational time complexity of O(n*(Max{q. K. z})). in which n is the number of fact clauses; q is the number of rules in the longest inference chain; K is the number of tubes containing antecedents which are comprised of distinct number of starting nodes; and z denotes the maximum number of distinct antecedents comprised of the same number of starting nodes.,True,xBjGqQoAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,4,https://www.scirp.org/html/3-9601295_54046.htm?pagespeed=noscript,5093481746396771941,/scholar?cites=5093481746396771941,,,https://www.scirp.org/html/3-9601295_54046.htm?pagespeed=noscript,0,0,0

1282467,Application of sparse Bayesian generalized linear model to gene expression data for classification of prostate cancer subtypes,2014,Behrouz Madahian and Lih Y Deng and Ramin Homayouni,2014,Open Journal of Statistics,,,Scientific Research Publishing,A major limitation of expression profiling is caused by the large number of variables assessed compared to relatively small sample sizes. In this study. we developed a multinomial Probit Bayesian model which utilizes the double exponential prior to induce shrinkage and reduce the number of covariates in the model [1]. A hierarchical Sparse Bayesian Generalized Linear Model (SBGLM) was developed in order to facilitate Gibbs sampling which takes into account the progressive nature of the response variable. The method was evaluated using a published dataset (GSE6099) which contained 99 prostate cancer cell types in four different progressive stages [2]. Initially. 398 genes were selected using ordinal logistic regression with a cutoff value of 0.05 after Benjamini and Hochberg FDR correction. The dataset was randomly divided into training (N = 50) and test (N = 49) groups such that each group contained equal number of each cancer subtype. In order to obtain more robust results we performed 50 re-samplings of the training and test groups. Using the top ten genes obtained from SBGLM. we were able to achieve an average classification accuracy of 85% and 80% in training and test groups. respectively. To functionally evaluate the model performance. we used a literature mining approach called Geneset Cohesion Analysis Tool [3]. Examination of the top 100 genes produced an average functional cohesion p-value of 0.007 compared to 0.047 and 0.131 produced by classical multi-category logistic regression and Random Forest approaches. respectively.

Caiado and P. Ivson,,Journal of Civil Engineering and Management,,,,One of the main problems the construction industry faces is the high cost and slow execution time due to inadequate planning. which results in poor use of human resources. A common solution for reducing time and costs is the adoption of prefabricated components (prefabs). This paper proposes a novel methodology for interdisciplinary management of construction projects by integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Lean Thinking to improve the production planning and control of pipe-rack modules in an industrial facility. The article first presents a literature review to assess the key synergies between BIM and Lean Thinking. These led to the development of a new integrated work methodology named Digital Obeya Room.

1282485,Instanced rendering of massive cad models using shape matching,2014,Paulo Ivson Netto Santos and Waldemar Celes Filho,,,,335-342,IEEE,We present an efficient approach to greatly reduce memory usage and to achieve high rendering performance for massive 3D CAD models. Our work is based on the observation that these models often contain many instances of the same geometries. Using a shape matching algorithm. we identify these instances and estimate the optimal affine transformation between them. The resulting sets of unique geometries only require a fraction of the memory used by the original 3D model. This compact representation can be rendered efficiently using hardware-accelerated geometry instancing. As another benefit. this allows for interactive rendering of highly dynamic scenes of up to a million moving objects. Our proposal assumes no knowledge about the scene. and thus can be applied to other kinds of massive 3D models with similar properties.,True,0l3nOzYAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,9,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6915326/,7337538185405395215,/scholar?cites=7337538185405395215,,,,0,0,0

They are also present in other applications. such as mesostructure rendering. However. height maps are incapable of representing overhangs or self-folding surfaces. as well as several occluding objects. In this paper we propose a novel representation to overcome these limitations. A Solid Height-map Set is used to represent arbitrary solid geometry. We also describe a procedure to convert polygonal meshes into our scheme.

Calculations are performed both with PBE and PBEsol exchange correlation functionals. We conclude that PBE systematically overestimates the lattice constants and the magnitude of the ferroelectric distortion. whereas PBEsol leads to good agreement with available experimental data. We then assess a potential site preference by comparing ten different distributions of the Fe 3+ cation on the perovskite B sites. We find a slight preference for the “inner” site. consistent with recent experimental observations. We obtain a large value of∼ 55 μ C/cm 2 for the spontaneous electric polarization. which is rather independent of the specific Fe distribution.

We use Monte Carlo simulations to calculate transition temperatures for an effective Heisenberg model containing a minimal set of required couplings. The magnitude of the corresponding coupling constants has been determined previously from electronic structure calculations for Bi 5 FeTi 3 O 15. for which we obtain a transition temperature far below room temperature. We analyze the role of further neighbor interactions within our Heisenberg model. in particular that of the second-nearest-neighbor coupling within the perovskitelike layers of the Aurivillius structure. as well as that of the weak interlayer coupling. in order to identify the main bottleneck for achieving higher magnetic transition temperatures.

Our calculations indicate that the site preference of the Fe3+ cation can be controlled via epitaxial strain. Tensile strain enhances the preference for the inner sites within the perovskite-like layers of the Aurivillius-phase structure. whereas compressive strain favors occupation of the outer sites. i.e.. the sites close to the Bi2O2 layer. Controlling the distribution of the magnetic cations offers the possibility to control magnetic order in this magnetically dilute system. Furthermore. the magnitude of the electric polarization is strongly strain-dependent. increasing under tensile strain and decreasing under compressive strain.

It was recently demonstrated that monolayer FeSe on a SrTiO 3 substrate exhibits a much higher superconducting critical temperature T c than the bulk material. Here. we examine the interfacial structure of FeSe/SrTiO 3 and the effect of an interfacial Ti 1+ x O 2 layer on the increased T c using a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory. We find Ti 1+ x O 2 forms its own quasi-two-dimensional layer. bonding to both the substrate and the FeSe film by van der Waals interactions. The excess Ti in this layer can reconstruct the FeSe Fermi surface in a manner consistent with experimental observations.

In contrast. T c has been measured to be only 3.7 K in bi-layer FeSe deposited on graphene (extrapolated to about 2 K in a monolayer). pointing to the major role of the interface in enhancing superconductivity. Here we determine the atomic structure of an interfacial layer and identify its role in driving the increase in T c using a combination of quantum mechanical calculations and scanning transmission electron microscopy.

Crucial to their design are predictions of atomic-scale transport pathways in materials. For instance. while recent experimental studies of unique nanobrush geometries of Ceria-Ytria superlattices demonstrated that these materials exhibit excellent oxygen transport. little is known about the mechanisms that lead to this optimal behavior. Using first-principles methods. we have examined the oxygen vacancy transport at or near the interface in a Y 2 O 3/CeO 2 superlattice model. Our results give insights in both the preference for oxygen vacancy formation as well as dynamics within the superlattice-having significant implications for the aforementioned nanobrushes.,True,6AXMIA4AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018APS..MARX09001B/abstract,,,,,,0,0,0

Although many post-translational modification sites have been experimentally determined. particularly in certain model organisms. experimental knowledge of these sites is severely lacking for many species. Thus. it is important to be able to predict sites of post-translational modification in such species. Previously. we described DAPPLE. a tool that facilitates the homology-based prediction of one particular post-translational modification. phosphorylation. in an organism of interest using known phosphorylation sites from other organisms. Here. we describe DAPPLE 2. which expands and improves upon DAPPLE in three major ways.

Consequently. lodging results in reduced crop quality. lowers crop yield. and makes harvesting difficult. Plant breeders routinely evaluate several thousand breeding lines. and therefore. automatic lodging detection and prediction is of great value aid in selection. In this paper. we propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture for lodging classification using five spectral channel orthomosaic images from canola and wheat breeding trials. Also. using transfer learning. we trained 10 lodging detection models using well-established deep convolutional neural network architectures. Our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art lodging detection methods in the literature that use only handcrafted features. In comparison to 10 DCNN lodging detection models. our proposed model achieves comparable results while having a substantially lower number of parameters.

One drawback of these methods is their low specificity or high false positive rate. Over-representation analysis is one of the most commonly used gene set analysis methods. In this paper. we propose a systematic approach to investigate the hypothesis that gene set overlap is an underlying cause of low specificity in over-representation analysis. We quantify gene set overlap and show that it is a ubiquitous phenomenon across gene set databases. Statistical analysis indicates a strong negative correlation between gene set overlap and the specificity of over-representation analysis. We conclude that gene set overlap is an underlying cause of the low specificity. This result highlights the importance of considering gene set overlap in gene set analysis and explains the lack of specificity of methods that ignore gene set overlap.

This work considers the problem of garment perception and folding procedure by a home service robot. focusing on the task of recognizing a piece of spread-out garment on a flat platform. The robotic platform setup is as general as possible to enable the robot to cater for multiple types of household chores. We propose a novel approach to understand the perception for a piece of garment using particle-based polygonal model and an algorithm to best-fit the model into the garment in an image directly rather than designing the template from a software. The simplest way to analyze the basic configuration of a piece of unknown garment is to spread out the garment on a flat platform.

1282525,Towards meticulous data plane monitoring,2017,Apoorv Shukla and Said Jawad Saidi and Stefan Schmid and Marco Canini and Anja Feldmann,,,,,,Software-defined networks (SDNs) are built on the promise of consistency between control and data plane. Data plane consists of software or hardware and is subject to failures eg. hardware or software bugs. Sometimes. these failures are outside the knowledge of the control plane consisting of network operating system or the SDN controller. The current state-of-the art tools either check the network statically from the control plane or use tagging or active probe generation to check the data plane behaviour. There is a spectrum of control plane mechanisms [1].[2].[3].[4] which check for some or all of the network-wide invariants like reachability. forwarding loops. waypoint enforcement and slice isolation. While most of the control plane mechanisms cannot model ECMP or NAT. all of them. however. are unaware of the actual behaviour on the data plane and thus. assume that control plane has a consistent view. There is a panoply of data plane mechanisms involving tagging [5].[6] or active probe generation [7].[8] which either check the path or the installed flow rules to monitor the data plane. Moreover. ping and traceroute continue to be the only tools available for network debugging to the network administrators in practice. Bugs in flow table match-action logic or switch hardware can manifest in various ways which are hard to detect and thus. to localize by any of the existing approaches. Moreover. tagging comes with its own limitations. There cannot be available and sufficient space for placing tags for a big scale scenario. Some of the existing mechanisms end up placing a lot of flow rules on the scarce TCAM to take action on tagged packets [5].[9 …,True,zENcc_kAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,56,http://eprints.cs.univie.ac.at/5739/1/10-Towards%20meticulous.pdf,7180437437445677211,/scholar?cites=7180437437445677211,,,http://eprints.cs.univie.ac.at/5739/1/10-Towards%20meticulous.pdf,0,0,0

To further enhance the performance. a part of the functionality is often offloaded to forwarding devices. which are used as hardware accelerators and are configured by high level programming languages such as P4. However. hardware vendors use sophisticated technologies to implement these standards. which need to be understood by the programmer to avoid unintended behavior.

1282535,Towards runtime verification of programmable switches,2020,Apoorv Shukla and Kevin Hudemann and Zsolt Vági and Lily Hügerich and Georgios Smaragdakis and Stefan Schmid and Artur Hecker and Anja Feldmann,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.10887,,,,Is it possible to patch software bugs in P4 programs without human involvement? We show that this is partially possible in many cases due to advances in software testing and the structure of P4 programs. Our insight is that runtime verification can detect bugs. even those that are not detected at compile-time. with machine learning-guided fuzzing. This enables a more automated and real-time localization of bugs in P4 programs using software testing techniques like Tarantula. Once the bug in a P4 program is localized. the faulty code can be patched due to the programmable nature of P4. In addition. platform-dependent bugs can be detected. From P4_14 to P4_16 (latest version). our observation is that as the programmable blocks increase. the patchability of P4 programs increases accordingly. To this end. we design. develop. and evaluate P6 that (a) detects.(b) localizes. and (c) patches bugs in P4 programs with minimal human interaction. P6 tests P4 switch non-intrusively. ie. requires no modification to the P4 program for detecting and localizing bugs. We used a P6 prototype to detect and patch seven existing bugs in eight publicly available P4 application programs deployed on two different switch platforms: behavioral model (bmv2) and Tofino. Our evaluation shows that P6 significantly outperforms bug detection baselines while generating fewer packets and patches bugs in P4 programs such as switch. p4 without triggering any regressions.,True,zENcc_kAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10887,922198061947843431,/scholar?cites=922198061947843431,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10887,0,0,0

1282536,Multiple human object tracking using background subtraction and shadow removal techniques,2010,S Saravanakumar and A Vadivel and CG Saneem Ahmed,,,,79-84,IEEE,The main objective of this paper is to develop multiple human object tracking approach based on motion estimation and detection. background subtraction. shadow removal and occlusion detection. A reference frame is initially used and considered as background information. While a new object enters into the frame. the foreground information and background information are identified using the reference frame as background model. Most of the times. the shadow of the background information is merged with the foreground object and makes the tracking process a complex one.

In this paper. we present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for solar panel soiling and defect analysis. Our approach takes an RGB image of solar panel and environmental factors as inputs to predict power loss. soiling localization. and soiling type. In computer vision. localization is a complex task which typically requires manually labeled training data such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks. Our proposed approach consists of specialized four stages which completely avoids localization ground truth and only needs panel images with power loss labels for training.

Further. none of the above formulations offer an explicit control over the degree of sparsity. To address this. we develop a unified framework that encompasses all these formulations as special cases. This framework ensures simple closed-form solutions and existence of sub-gradients suitable for learning via backpropagation. Within this framework. we propose two novel sparse formulations. sparsegen-lin and sparsehourglass. that seek to provide a control over the degree of desired sparsity. We further develop novel convex loss functions that help induce the behavior of aforementioned formulations in the multilabel classification setting. showing improved performance. We also demonstrate empirically that the proposed formulations. when used to compute attention weights. achieve better or comparable performance on standard seq2seq tasks like neural machine translation and abstractive summarization.,True,FZ4YVdcAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,14,https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11975,3504521471854604409,/scholar?cites=3504521471854604409,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11975,0,0,0

In this work. we propose a regression-based learning framework which takes into account quantitatively the essential criteria for creativity like novelty. influence. value and unexpectedness. As it is often the case with most creative domains. there is no clear ground truth available for creativity. Our proposed learning framework is applicable to all creative domains; yet we evaluate it on a dataset of movies created from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes due to availability of audience and critic scores. which can be used as proxy ground truth labels for creativity.

Here we consider feature selection for supervised learning problems. where one wishes to select a small set of features that facilitate learning a good prediction model in the reduced feature space. Our interest is primarily in filter methods that select features independently of the learning algorithm to be used and are generally faster to implement than wrapper methods. Many common filter methods for feature selection make use of mutual information based criteria to guide their search process.

In order to improve the accuracy on this task. specialized pre-training techniques have been developed and applied on millions of open-domain web tables. In this paper. we propose two novel approaches demonstrating that one can achieve superior performance on table QA task without even using any of these specialized pre-training techniques. The first model. called RCI interaction. leverages a transformer based architecture that independently classifies rows and columns to identify relevant cells. While this model yields extremely high accuracy at finding cell values on recent benchmarks. a second model we propose. called RCI representation. provides a significant efficiency advantage for online QA systems over tables by materializing embeddings for existing tables. Experiments on recent benchmarks prove that the proposed methods can effectively locate cell values on tables (up to ~98% Hit@1 accuracy on WikiSQL lookup questions).

An ideal intrusion detection system (IDS) is one that has appreciable detection capability overall the group of attacks. An open research problem of this area is the lower detection rate for less frequent attacks. which result from the curse of dimensionality and imbalanced class distribution of the benchmark datasets.

What adds to the complexity of the problem is the near real-time response to a threat. imbalanced datasets to deal with and finally the data being mixed in nature with some features being numeric some discrete and some nominal. In this work we have applied Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset and eliminate the skewness of the class distribution. The success of k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) depends upon the set of neighbours deemed to be very close or similar to a data point which is in turn determined by the similarity/distance metric employed. where most of the metrics employed in literature deal with numeric data only. and either need conversion of categorical features to numeric features or simply eliminated the categorical features. which often leads to reduction in the results. As for this work is considered. we take into consideration both the categories of features simultaneously by replacing the conventional Euclidean metric with Gower metric. which is better suited for mixed data. Gower metric provides a mechanism to deal with heterogeneous features differently and ultimately yields a quantifiable value that determines the similarity of the two instances. Experimental results show that improvised version of k-NN outperforms its conventional counterpart in terms of the Accuracy. Detection Rate. Precision.

The latest to appear on the scene is bringing convenience in how agriculture can be done by employing various computational technologies. There are lots of factors that affect agricultural production. with seed quality topping the list. Seed classification can provide additional knowledge about quality production. seed quality control and impurity identification. The process of categorising seeds has been traditionally done based on characteristics like colour. shape and texture. Generally. this is performed by specialists by visually inspecting each sample. which is a very tedious and time-consuming task. This procedure can be easily automated. providing a significantly more efficient method for seed sorting than having them be inspected using human labour. In related areas. computer vision technology based on machine learning (ML). symmetry and. more particularly. convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been generously applied. often resulting in increased work efficiency. Considering the success of the computational intelligence methods in other image classification problems. this research proposes a classification system for seeds by employing CNN and transfer learning. The proposed system contains a model that classifies 14 commonly known seeds with the implication of advanced deep learning techniques. The techniques applied in this research include decayed learning rate. model checkpointing and hybrid weight adjustment.

Surprisingly little is known about opsin evolution in beetles. even though they are the most species rich animal group on Earth and exhibit considerable variation in visual system sensitivities. We reveal the patterns of opsin evolution across 62 beetle species and relatives. Our results show that the major insect opsin class (SW) that typically confers sensitivity to “blue” wavelengths was lost~ 300 million years ago. before the origin of modern beetles. We propose that UV and LW opsin gene duplications have restored the potential for trichromacy (three separate channels for colour vision) in beetles up to 12 times and more specifically. duplications within the UV opsin class have likely led to the restoration of “blue” sensitivity up to 10 times.

Polymorphic datasets are a challenge for many bioinformatic software packages that are designed for or assume homozygosity of an input dataset. This assumption ignores the true genomic composition of many organisms that are diploid or polyploid. In this survey. two different error correction packages. Quake and ECHO. are examined to see how they perform on next-generation sequence data from heterozygous genomes. Quake and ECHO perform well and were able to correct many errors found within the data. However. errors that occur at heterozygous positions had unique trends. Errors at these positions were sometimes corrected incorrectly. introducing errors into the dataset with the possibility of creating a chimeric read. Quake was much less likely to create chimeric reads. Quake's read trimming removed a large portion of the original data and often left reads with few heterozygous markers. ECHO resulted in more chimeric reads and introduced more errors than Quake but preserved heterozygous markers. Using real E. coli sequencing data and their assemblies after error correction. the assembly statistics improved. It was also found that segregating reads by haplotype can improve the quality of an assembly. These findings suggest that Quake and ECHO both have strengths and weaknesses when applied to heterozygous data. With the increased interest in haplotype specific analysis. new tools that are designed to be haplotype-aware are necessary that do not have the weaknesses of Quake and ECHO.,True,Mj2H-GUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,20,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-S7-S3,11803364619599722943,/scholar?cites=11803364619599722943,,,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-S7-S3,0,0,0

There are many existing heuristic tools. most commonly based on bidirectional BLAST searches that are used to identify homologous genes and combine them into two fundamentally distinct classes: orthologs and paralogs. Due to only using heuristic filtering based on significance score cutoffs and having no cluster post-processing tools available. these methods can often produce multiple clusters constituting unrelated (non-homologous) sequences. Therefore sequencing data extracted from incomplete genome/transcriptome assemblies originated from low coverage sequencing or produced by de novo processes without a reference genome are susceptible to high false positive rates of homology detection. In this paper we develop biologically informative features that can be extracted from multiple sequence alignments of putative homologous genes (orthologs and paralogs) and further utilized in context of guided experimentation to verify false positive outcomes. We demonstrate that our machine learning method trained on both known homology clusters obtained from OrthoDB and randomly generated sequence alignments (non-homologs). successfully determines apparent false positives inferred by heuristic algorithms especially among proteomes recovered from low-coverage RNA-seq data.

When applied to diploid genome assembly. these assemblers perform poorly. owing to the violation of assumptions during both the contigging and scaffolding phases. Effective tools to overcome these problems are in growing demand. Increasing parameter stringency during contigging is an effective solution to obtaining haplotype-specific contigs; however. effective algorithms for scaffolding such contigs are lacking. We present a stand-alone scaffolding algorithm. ScaffoldScaffolder. designed specifically for scaffolding diploid genomes. The algorithm identifies homologous sequences as found in ""bubble"" structures in scaffold graphs. Machine learning classification is used to then classify sequences in partial bubbles as homologous or non-homologous sequences prior to reconstructing haplotype-specific scaffolds. We define four new metrics for assessing diploid scaffolding accuracy: contig sequencing depth. contig homogeneity. phase group homogeneity. and heterogeneity between phase groups. We demonstrate the viability of using bubbles to identify heterozygous homologous contigs. which we term homolotigs. We show that machine learning classification trained on these homolotig pairs can be used effectively for identifying homologous sequences elsewhere in the data with high precision (assuming error-free reads).

Deep learning approaches certainly offer a great variety of opportunities for solving classical imaging tasks and also for approaching new stimulating problems in the spatial–spectral domain. This is fundamental in the driving sector of Remote Sensing where hyperspectral technology was born and has mostly developed. but it is perhaps even more true in the multitude of current and evolving application sectors that involve these imaging technologies. The present review develops on two fronts: on the one hand. it is aimed at domain professionals who want to have an updated overview on how hyperspectral acquisition techniques can combine with deep learning architectures to solve specific tasks in different application fields. On the other hand. we want to target the machine learning and computer vision experts by giving them a picture of how deep learning technologies are applied to hyperspectral data from a multidisciplinary perspective. The presence of these two viewpoints and the inclusion of application fields other than Remote Sensing are the original contributions of this review. which also highlights some potentialities and critical issues related to the observed development trends.

As empathy is a key aspect of audience’s filmic experience. creative decisions in editing and cinematography may be motivated by the filmmaker’s intention of eliciting empathy. The goal of this study is to investigate what film scenes intended to elicit empathy look like in terms of those visual formal features theoretically or empirically linked to viewer empathy. and if these features converge on something that might be dubbed an empathic style of cinema. Formal features included concern shot scale. face depiction. cut rate. camera perspective and angle. saturation. lighting. motion. and background clutter. Exploratory quantitative formal analyses of scenes sampled from contemporary popular empathy-eliciting Hollywood films (N= 100) revealed that such scenes are. at first glance. highly dissimilar in form. Further investigation through principal component analysis and correlational analysis. however. hints not so much at a singular empathic style of cinema as it does at certain general principles. namely the reduction of perceived distance through close-ups and face depiction. the balancing of arousing features with comprehensible levels of visual complexity. and the prioritization of coherence and reduced visual contrast to enable a smooth viewing experience.,True,fEPYwtAAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katalin_Balint/publication/344106672_Shaping_Film_A_Quantitative_Formal_Analysis_of_Contemporary_Empathy-eliciting_Hollywood_Cinema/links/5f526cd8458515e96d2c6d01/Shaping-Film-A-Quantitative-Formal-Analysis-of-Contemporary-Empathy-eliciting-Hollywood-Cinema.pdf,9801434456974560081,/scholar?cites=9801434456974560081,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katalin_Balint/publication/344106672_Shaping_Film_A_Quantitative_Formal_Analysis_of_Contemporary_Empathy-eliciting_Hollywood_Cinema/links/5f526cd8458515e96d2c6d01/Shaping-Film-A-Quantitative-Formal-Analysis-of-Contemporary-Empathy-eliciting-Hollywood-Cinema.pdf,0,0,0

UAVs find a target in minimum time using Minimum Time Search (MTS) methods. Different optimisation paradigms. such as cross-entropy optimisation (CEO) and ant-colony optimisation (ACO) can be used for MTS. In this work. a set of simulation scenarios has been designed to test the ACO solution to the MTS problem. Simulations performed for each scenario take into account a heuristic function and its effect on the probability of detection of target and estimated time for detection. The results obtained for various scenarios based on external and internal factors in UAV trajectory planning (size of search grid. target distribution. etc.) are compared to categorise the best set of such factors across four input domains.

Compressed Sensing has provided theoretical foundations upon which desired sampling rate can be achieved by applying a sparsity promoting algorithm on sub-sampled data. The key point in successful recovery is to deploy a randomized sampling scheme. In this paper. we propose a novel deep learning-based method for fast and accurate reconstruction of heavily under-sampled seismic data. regardless of type of sampling. A neural network learns to do reconstruction directly from data via an adversarial process. Once trained. the reconstruction can be done by just feeding the frequency slice with missing data into the neural network. This adaptive nonlinear model makes the algorithm extremely flexible. applicable to data with arbitrarily type of sampling.

Unfortunately. it is often not possible to afford being physically or numerically accurate. To overcome this conundrum. we make use of raw and processed data from nearby surveys. We have used these data. consisting of shot records or velocity models. to pretrain a neural network to correct for the effects of. for instance. the free surface or numerical dispersion. both of which can be considered as proxies for incomplete or inaccurate physics. Given this pretrained neural network. we apply transfer learning to fine-tune this pretrained neural network so it performs well on its task of mapping low-cost. but low-fidelity. solutions to high-fidelity solutions for the current survey.

1282596,A deep-learning based bayesian approach to seismic imaging and uncertainty quantification,2020,Ali Siahkoohi and Gabrio Rizzuti and F Herrmann,2020,,1,1-5,European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers,Uncertainty quantification is essential when dealing with ill-conditioned inverse problems due to the inherent nonuniqueness of the solution. Bayesian approaches allow us to determine how likely an estimation of the unknown parameters is via formulating the posterior distribution. Unfortunately. it is often not possible to formulate a prior distribution that precisely encodes our prior knowledge about the unknown. Furthermore. adherence to handcrafted priors may greatly bias the outcome of the Bayesian analysis. To address this issue. we propose to use the functional form of a randomly initialized convolutional neural network as an implicit structured prior. which is shown to promote natural images and excludes images with unnatural noise. In order to incorporate the model uncertainty into the final estimate. we sample the posterior distribution using stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and perform Bayesian …,True,sxRMqYIAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,9,https://www.earthdoc.org/content/papers/10.3997/2214-4609.202010770,14192604084620796570,/scholar?cites=14192604084620796570,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04567,0,0,0

While these developments are certainly important. we are after all dealing with an imaging problem involving an unknown earth and not completely understood physics. When the imaging step itself is not handled properly. this may possibly offset gains offered by deep learning. Motivated by our work on deep convolutional neural networks in seismic data reconstruction. we discuss how generative networks can be employed in prestack problems ranging from the relatively mondane removal of the effects of the free surface to dealing with the complex effects of numerical dispersion in time-domain finite differences.

Setting seismic imaging into a Bayesian framework allows for a principled way of studying uncertainty by solving for the model posterior distribution. Imaging. however. typically constitutes only the first stage of a sequential workflow. and UQ becomes even more relevant when applied to subsequent tasks that are highly sensitive to the inversion outcome.

1282607,Deep discriminative latent space for clustering,2018,Elad Tzoreff and Olga Kogan and Yoni Choukroun,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.10795,,,,Clustering is one of the most fundamental tasks in data analysis and machine learning. It is central to many data-driven applications that aim to separate the data into groups with similar patterns. Moreover. clustering is a complex procedure that is affected significantly by the choice of the data representation method. Recent research has demonstrated encouraging clustering results by learning effectively these representations. In most of these works a deep auto-encoder is initially pre-trained to minimize a reconstruction loss. and then jointly optimized with clustering centroids in order to improve the clustering objective. Those works focus mainly on the clustering phase of the procedure. while not utilizing the potential benefit out of the initial phase. In this paper we propose to optimize an auto-encoder with respect to a discriminative pairwise loss function during the auto-encoder pre-training phase. We demonstrate the high accuracy obtained by the proposed method as well as its rapid convergence (eg reaching above 92% accuracy on MNIST during the pre-training phase. in less than 50 epochs). even with small networks.,True,bzew_zQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,10,https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10795,10944506706042073487,/scholar?cites=10944506706042073487,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10795,0,0,0

The sensor intercepts the incoming signal at different locations along its trajectory. thus. effectively creating an array of spatially separated sensors. We discuss the method and its performance in the presence of noise and oscillators instability. The proposed method provides a few advantages over the traditional multisensor TOA method. These include the economic aspect of using a single receiver instead of several ones. synchronization between stations is not required since only a single sensor is used. on line optimization of the emitter-sensor geometry in order to improve performance (path design. number of data collection points. etc.). and finally. there is no requirement to transmit data between sensors.

Practical applications of deep learning in resource-limited hardware. such as embedded devices and smart phones. however. remain challenging. For binary convolutional networks. the reason lies in the degraded representation caused by binarizing full-precision filters. To address this problem. we propose new circulant filters (CiFs) and a circulant binary convolution (CBConv) to enhance the capacity of binarized convolutional features via our circulant back propagation (CBP). The CiFs can be easily incorporated into existing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). which leads to new Circulant Binary Convolutional Networks (CBCNs). Extensive experiments confirm that the performance gap between the 1-bit and full-precision DCNNs is minimized by increasing the filter diversity. which further increases the representational ability in our networks. Our experiments on ImageNet show that CBCNs achieve 61.4% top-1 accuracy with ResNet18. Compared to the state-of-the-art such as XNOR.

Singapore,The aerial target detection and recognition are very challenging due to large appearance. lighting and orientation variations. We propose a Deep-patch Orientation Network (DON) method. which is general and can learn the encoded orientation information based on any off the-shelf deep detection framework. e.g.. Faster-RCNN and YOLO. and result into higher performance in airplane target detection and classification tasks. Most existing methods neglected the orientation information. which in DON is obtained based on the structure information contained in the patch training samples. In testing process. we introduce an orientation based method to exploit patches for whole target localization. Also. we analyzed how to improve agnostic-target detection framework by tailoring the reference boxes. Experimental results on two datasets show that. our proposed DON method improves the recall at high precision …,True,iKZfh-EAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-7389-2_18,15068598419084577065,/scholar?cites=15068598419084577065,,,,0,0,0

Moreover. temporal continuity in the detection phase gains more importance when scene cluttering introduces the challenging problems of occluded targets. For the purpose. we propose a deep network architecture that jointly extracts people body parts and associates them across short temporal spans. Our model explicitly deals with occluded body parts. by hallucinating plausible solutions of not visible joints. We propose a new end-to-end architecture composed by four branches (visible heatmaps. occluded heatmaps. part affinity fields and temporal affinity fields) fed by a time linker feature extractor. To overcome the lack of surveillance data with tracking. body part and occlusion annotations we created the vastest Computer Graphics dataset for people tracking in urban scenarios by exploiting a photorealistic videogame.

A second model. the Code Predictor. is then trained to predict these codes. which can be decompressed at test time to re-obtain the original representation. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method performs favorably when compared to state of the art on both multi-person and single-person 3D human pose estimation datasets and. thanks to our novel compression strategy. can process full-HD images at the constant runtime of 8 fps regardless of the number of subjects in the scene.

In this paper. we show that a standard model compression technique. weight pruning. cannot be applied to GANs using existing methods. We then develop a self-supervised compression technique which uses the trained discriminator to supervise the training of a compressed generator. We show that this framework has a compelling performance to high degrees of sparsity. can be easily applied to new tasks and models. and enables meaningful comparisons between different pruning granularities.,True,gfeep90AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01491,6096389513186641456,/scholar?cites=6096389513186641456,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01491,0,0,0

1282644,Robust facial landmark detection via a fully-convolutional local-global context network,2018,Daniel Merget and Matthias Rock and Gerhard Rigoll,,,,781-790,,While fully-convolutional neural networks are very strong at modeling local features. they fail to aggregate global context due to their constrained receptive field. Modern methods typically address the lack of global context by introducing cascades. pooling. or by fitting a statistical model. In this work. we propose a new approach that introduces global context into a fully-convolutional neural network directly. The key concept is an implicit kernel convolution within the network. The kernel convolution blurs the output of a local-context subnet. which is then refined by a global-context subnet using dilated convolutions. The kernel convolution is crucial for the convergence of the network because it smoothens the gradients and reduces overfitting. In a postprocessing step. a simple PCA-based 2D shape model is fitted to the network output in order to filter outliers.

Various algorithms exist. but no wider comparison has been made. yet. This work fills the gap by comparing state-of-the-art algorithms in a user study. We create and publish a database consisting of multiple base images and inpaint them using different inpainting concepts. Afterwards. 21 participants are asked to rate the quality of these inpainted images. The subjective feedback indicates that different image inpainting algorithms are favorable depending on the characteristics of the base image and target region.

Manipulations of 3D objects are a common way of such interactions. which can be performed in three different coordinate systems: the camera-. object-and world coordinate systems. The camera coordinate system changes continuously in augmented reality as it depends on the mobile device's pose. The axis orientations of the world coordinate system are steady. whereas the axes of the object coordinates base on previous manipulations.

We solve the correspondence problem efficiently by a sparse initial registration and a subsequent warping. which is refined in a surface matching step using topological projections.

These models are highly sample efficient as related concepts in the graph structure share statistical strength allowing generalization to new classes when faced with a lack of data. However. multi-layer architectures. which are required to propagate knowledge to distant nodes in the graph. dilute the knowledge by performing extensive Laplacian smoothing at each layer and thereby consequently decrease performance. In order to still enjoy the benefit brought by the graph structure while preventing dilution of knowledge from distant nodes. we propose a Dense Graph Propagation (DGP) module with carefully designed direct links among distant nodes. DGP allows us to exploit the hierarchical graph structure of the knowledge graph through additional connections. These connections are added based on a node's relationship to its ancestors and descendants. A weighting scheme is further used to weigh their contribution depending on the distance to the node to improve information propagation in the graph.

While more and more novel meta-learning models are being proposed. our research has uncovered simple baselines that have been overlooked. We present a Meta-Baseline method. by pre-training a classifier on all base classes and meta-learning on a nearest-centroid based few-shot classification algorithm. it outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Why does this simple method work so well? In the meta-learning stage. we observe that a model generalizing better on unseen tasks from base classes can have a decreasing performance on tasks from novel classes. indicating a potential objective discrepancy. We find both pre-training and inheriting a good few-shot classification metric from the pre-trained classifier are important for Meta-Baseline. which potentially helps the model better utilize the pre-trained representations with stronger transferability. Furthermore. we investigate when we need meta-learning in this Meta-Baseline.

While the visual world is presented in a continuous manner. machines store and see the images in a discrete way with 2D arrays of pixels. In this paper. we seek to learn a continuous representation for images. Inspired by the recent progress in 3D reconstruction with implicit function. we propose Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF). which takes an image coordinate and the 2D deep features around the coordinate as inputs. predicts the RGB value at a given coordinate as an output. Since the coordinates are continuous. LIIF can be presented in an arbitrary resolution. To generate the continuous representation for pixel-based images. we train an encoder and LIIF representation via a self-supervised task with super-resolution. The learned continuous representation can be presented in arbitrary resolution even extrapolate to  higher resolution. where the training tasks are not provided. We further show that LIIF representation builds a bridge between discrete and continuous representation in 2D. it naturally supports the learning tasks with size-varied image ground-truths and significantly outperforms the method with resizing the ground-truths.

Long-term sleep monitoring can provide meaningful information for patients with OSA to prevent and manage their symptoms. Even though various methods have been proposed to objectively measure sleep in ambulatory environments. less reliable information was provided in comparison with standard polysomnography (PSG). Therefore. this paper proposes an algorithm for distinguishing wakefulness from sleep using a patch-type device. which is applicable for both healthy individuals and patients with OSA.Electrocardiogram (ECG) and 3-axis accelerometer signals were gathered from the single device.

Previous studies have found that these systems are regulated by various types of interactions associated with physiological homeostasis. However. whether there is any interaction between these systems in different individuals is not well understood. The aim of this research was to determine whether or not there is any interaction between the physiological systems of independent individuals in an environment where they are connected with one another. We investigated the heart rhythms of co-sleeping individuals and found evidence that in co-sleepers. not only do independent heart rhythms appear in the same relative phase for prolonged periods. but also that their occurrence has a bidirectional causal relationship. Under controlled experimental conditions. the finding may be attributed to weak cardiac vibration delivered from one individual to the other via a mechanical bed connection.

Although various stimulation systems for enhancing sleep have been developed. they are difficult to use on a long-term basis. This paper proposes a novel stimulation system and confirms its feasibility for sleep. Specifically. in this study. a closed-loop vibration stimulation system that detects the heart rate (HR) and applies− n% stimulus beats per minute (BPM) computed on the basis of the previous 5 min of HR data was developed. Ten subjects participated in the evaluation experiment. in which they took a nap for approximately 90 min. The experiment comprised one baseline and three stimulation conditions. HR variability analysis showed that the normalized low frequency (LF) and LF/high frequency (HF) parameters significantly decreased compared to the baseline condition. while the normalized HF parameter significantly increased under the− 3% stimulation condition. In addition. the HR density around the stimulus BPM significantly increased under the− 3% stimulation condition. The results confirm that the proposed stimulation system could influence heart rhythm and stabilize the autonomic nervous system. This study thus provides a new stimulation approach to enhance the quality of sleep and has the potential for enhancing health levels through sleep manipulation.

Two strands of research are promising to improve models of this kind: the first uses wide networks (aka Transformer-Big) and has been the de facto standard for the development of the Transformer system. and the other uses deeper language representation but faces the difficulty arising from learning deep networks. Here. we continue the line of research on the latter. We claim that a truly deep Transformer model can surpass the Transformer-Big counterpart by 1) proper use of layer normalization and 2) a novel way of passing the combination of previous layers to the next. On WMT'16 English-German. NIST OpenMT'12 Chinese-English and larger WMT'18 Chinese-English tasks. our deep system (30/25-layer encoder) outperforms the shallow Transformer-Big/Base baseline (6-layer encoder) by 0.4-2.4 BLEU points.

In this paper. we investigate multi-encoder approaches in documentlevel neural machine translation (NMT). Surprisingly. we find that the context encoder does not only encode the surrounding sentences but also behaves as a noise generator. This makes us rethink the real benefits of multi-encoder in context-aware translation-some of the improvements come from robust training. We compare several methods that introduce noise and/or well-tuned dropout setup into the training of these encoders. Experimental results show that noisy training plays an important role in multi-encoder-based NMT. especially when the training data is small.

Moreover. why deep models help NMT is an open question. In this paper. we investigate the behavior of a well-tuned deep Transformer system. We find that stacking layers is helpful in improving the representation ability of NMT models and adjacent layers perform similarly. This inspires us to develop a shallow-to-deep training method that learns deep models by stacking shallow models. In this way. we successfully train a Transformer system with a 54-layer encoder.

In this paper. we explore a deeper relationship between Transformer and numerical methods of ODEs. We show that a residual block of layers in Transformer can be described as a higher-order solution to ODEs. This leads us to design a new architecture (call it ODE Transformer) analogous to the Runge-Kutta method that is well motivated in ODEs. As a natural extension to Transformer. ODE Transformer is easy to implement and parameter efficient.

It allows a small network to learn to generalize in the same way as a large network. Recent successes in pre-training suggest the effectiveness of transferring model parameters.

1282680,Building extraction from remote sensing data using fully convolutional networks,2017,Ksenia Bittner and Shiyong Cui and Peter Reinartz,42,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences-ISPRS Archives",W1,481-486,Copernicus Publications,Building detection and footprint extraction are highly demanded for many remote sensing applications. Though most previous works have shown promising results. the automatic extraction of building footprints still remains a nontrivial topic. especially in complex urban areas. Recently developed extensions of the CNN framework made it possible to perform dense pixel-wise classification of input images. Based on these abilities we propose a methodology. which automatically generates a full resolution binary building mask out of a Digital Surface Model (DSM) using a Fully Convolution Network (FCN) architecture. The advantage of using the depth information is that it provides geometrical silhouettes and allows a better separation of buildings from background as well as through its invariance to illumination and color variations. The proposed framework has mainly two steps. Firstly. the FCN is trained on a large set of patches consisting of normalized DSM (nDSM) as inputs and available ground truth building mask as target outputs. Secondly. the generated predictions from FCN are viewed as unary terms for a Fully connected Conditional Random Fields (FCRF). which enables us to create a final binary building mask. A series of experiments demonstrate that our methodology is able to extract accurate building footprints which are close to the buildings original shapes to a high degree. The quantitative and qualitative analysis show the significant improvements of the results in contrast to the multy-layer fully connected network from our previous work.,True,oPr46YIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,44,https://elib.dlr.de/112900/,7552137313586614864,/scholar?cites=7552137313586614864,,,https://elib.dlr.de/112900/1/Bittner_isprs-archives-XLII-1-W1-481-2017.pdf,0,0,0

1282682,Dsm-to-lod2: Spaceborne stereo digital surface model refinement,2018,Ksenia Bittner and Pablo d’Angelo and Marco Körner and Peter Reinartz,10,Remote Sensing,12,1926,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,A digital surface model (DSM) provides the geometry and structure of an urban environment with buildings being the most prominent objects in it. Built-up areas change with time due to the rapid expansion of cities. New buildings are being built. existing ones are expanded. and old buildings are torn down. As a result. 3D surface models can increase the understanding and explanation of complex urban scenarios. They are very useful in numerous fields of remote sensing applications. in tasks related to 3D reconstruction and city modeling. planning. visualization. disaster management. navigation. and decision-making. among others. DSMs are typically derived from various acquisition techniques. like photogrammetry. laser scanning. or synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The generation of DSMs from very high resolution optical stereo satellite imagery leads to high resolution DSMs which often suffer from mismatches. missing values. or blunders. resulting in coarse building shape representation. To overcome these problems. we propose a method for 3D surface model generation with refined building shapes to level of detail (LoD) 2 from stereo half-meter resolution satellite DSMs using deep learning techniques. Mainly. we train a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) with an objective function based on least square residuals to generate an accurate LoD2-like DSM with enhanced 3D object shapes directly from the noisy stereo DSM input. In addition. to achieve close to LoD2 shapes of buildings. we introduce a new approach to generate an artificial DSM with accurate and realistic building geometries from city geography markup …,True,oPr46YIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,19,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/12/1926,10668502821019588537,/scholar?cites=10668502821019588537,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/12/1926/htm,0,0,0

1282683,Automatic building footprint extraction from multi-resolution remote sensing images using a hybrid FCN,2019,Philipp Schuegraf and Ksenia Bittner,8,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,4,191,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Recent technical developments made it possible to supply large-scale satellite image coverage. This poses the challenge of efficient discovery of imagery. One very important task in applications like urban planning and reconstruction is to automatically extract building footprints. The integration of different information. which is presently achievable due to the availability of high-resolution remote sensing data sources. makes it possible to improve the quality of the extracted building outlines. Recently. deep neural networks were extended from image-level to pixel-level labelling. allowing to densely predict semantic labels. Based on these advances. we propose an end-to-end U-shaped neural network. which efficiently merges depth and spectral information within two parallel networks combined at the late stage for binary building mask generation. Moreover. as satellites usually provide high-resolution panchromatic images. but only low-resolution multi-spectral images. we tackle this issue by using a residual neural network block. It fuses those images with different spatial resolution at the early stage. before passing the fused information to the Unet stream. responsible for processing spectral information. In a parallel stream. a stereo digital surface model (DSM) is also processed by the Unet. Additionally. we demonstrate that our method generalizes for use in cities which are not included in the training data.

There are two main ways to obtain elevation information: from active remote sensing systems. such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR). and from passive remote sensing systems. such as optical images. which allow the acquisition of stereo images for automatic digital surface models (DSMs) generation. Although airborne laser scanning provides very accurate DSMs. it is a costly method. On the other hand. the DSMs from stereo satellite imagery show a large coverage and lower costs. However. they are not as accurate as LIDAR DSMs. With respect to automatic 3D information extraction. the availability of accurate and detailed DSMs is a crucial issue for automatic 3D building model reconstruction. We present a novel methodology for generating a better-quality stereo DSM with refined buildings shapes using a deep learning framework.

This can result in improved learning efficiency and prediction accuracy for the task-specific models compared to separately trained models. In this paper. we make an observation of such influences for important remote sensing applications like elevation model generation and semantic segmentation tasks from the stereo half-meter resolution satellite digital surface models (DSMs). Mainly. we aim to generate good-quality DSMs with complete. as well as accurate level of detail (LoD) 2-like building forms and to assign an object class label to each pixel in the DSMs. For the label assignment task. we select the roof type classification problem to distinguish between flat. non-flat. and background pixels. To realize those tasks. we train a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) with an objective function based on least squares residuals and an auxiliary term based on normal vectors for further roof surface refinement. Besides. we investigate recently published deep learning architectures for both tasks and develop the final end-to-end network. which combines different models. as using them first separately. they provide the best results for their individual tasks.

Cham,Cardiac functional parameters. such as. the Ejection Fraction (EF) and Cardiac Output (CO) of both ventricles. are most immediate indicators of normal/abnormal cardiac function. To compute these parameters. accurate measurement of ventricular volumes at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) are required. Accurate volume measurements depend on the correct identification of basal and apical slices in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) sequences that provide full coverage of both left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles. This paper proposes a novel adversarial learning (AL) approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) that detects and localizes the basal/apical slices in an image volume independently of image-acquisition parameters. such as. imaging device. magnetic field strength. variations in protocol execution. etc. The proposed model is trained on multiple cohorts of different provenance …,True,N3gALRkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,12,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00934-2_54,7252633544398408983,/scholar?cites=7252633544398408983,,,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6b7c19aa-26a2-4375-b536-c74c168cc3ca/download_file?safe_filename=Multi-input%2Band%2Bdataset-invariant%2Badversarial%2Blearning%2B%2528MDAL%2529%2Bfor%2Bleft%2Band%2Bright-ventricular%2Bcoverage%2Bestimation%2Bin%2Bcard.pdf&file_format=application%2Fpdf&type_of_work=Conference+item,0,0,0

Among them. there is a defect that the kernel-bandwidth of the traditional object tracking algorithm based on Mean-Shift is fixed. which is very easy to cause the failure of the object tracking. To overcome this shortage. this paper puts forward an object tracking method that combines the canny operator with the Mean Shift algorithm. Firstly. this algorithm uses the canny edge detection to determine the change tendency of the object. Then proper ratio increment is used to adjust the Kernel-bandwidth of the Mean Shift. Finally. the object can be located accurately with appropriate kernel-bandwidth.

However. missing or unusable slices owing to the presence of image artefacts such as respiratory or motion ghosting. aliasing. ringing and signal loss in CMR sequences. significantly hinder accuracy of anatomical and functional cardiac quantification. and recovering from those is insufficiently addressed in population imaging.

However. the predictive performance of these algorithms depend on the quality of labels. especially in medical image domain. where both the annotation cost and inter-observer variability are high. In a typical annotation collection process. different clinical experts provide their estimates of the “true” segmentation labels under the influence of their levels of expertise and biases. Treating these noisy labels blindly as the ground truth can adversely affect the performance of supervised segmentation models.

1282704,GDPP: Learning diverse generations using determinantal point processes,2019,Mohamed Elfeki and Camille Couprie and Morgane Riviere and Mohamed Elhoseiny,,,,1774-1783,PMLR,Generative models have proven to be an outstanding tool for representing high-dimensional probability distributions and generating realistic looking images. An essential characteristic of generative models is their ability to produce multi-modal outputs. However. while training. they are often susceptible to mode collapse. that is models are limited in mapping input noise to only a few modes of the true data distribution. In this work. we draw inspiration from Determinantal Point Process (DPP) to propose an unsupervised penalty loss that alleviates mode collapse while producing higher quality samples. DPP is an elegant probabilistic measure used to model negative correlations within a subset and hence quantify its diversity. We use DPP kernel to model the diversity in real data as well as in synthetic data. Then. we devise an objective term that encourages generator to synthesize data with a similar diversity to real data. In contrast to previous state-of-the-art generative models that tend to use additional trainable parameters or complex training paradigms. our method does not change the original training scheme. Embedded in an adversarial training and variational autoencoder. our Generative DPP approach shows a consistent resistance to mode-collapse on a wide-variety of synthetic data and natural image datasets including MNIST.

Consequently. we introduce a new sampling approach based on the reshaping of the search distribution. and we show both theoretically and numerically that it leads to significant gains over random search. Two methods are proposed for the reshaping: Recentering (when the distribution of the optimum is known). and Cauchy transformation (when the distribution of the optimum is unknown).

Despite considerable effort by the catalysis community to apply machine learning models to the computational catalyst discovery process. it remains an open challenge to build models that can generalize across both elemental compositions of surfaces and adsorbate identity/configurations. perhaps because datasets have been smaller in catalysis than related fields.

1282712,An Introduction to Electrocatalyst Design using Machine Learning for Renewable Energy Storage,2020,C Lawrence Zitnick and Lowik Chanussot and Abhishek Das and Siddharth Goyal and Javier Heras-Domingo and Caleb Ho and Weihua Hu and Thibaut Lavril and Aini Palizhati and Morgane Riviere and Muhammed Shuaibi and Anuroop Sriram and Kevin Tran and Brandon Wood and Junwoong Yoon and Devi Parikh and Zachary Ulissi,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.09435,,,,Scalable and cost-effective solutions to renewable energy storage are essential to addressing the world's rising energy needs while reducing climate change. As we increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. which produce intermittent power. storage is needed to transfer power from times of peak generation to peak demand. This may require the storage of power for hours. days. or months. One solution that offers the potential of scaling to nation-sized grids is the conversion of renewable energy to other fuels. such as hydrogen or methane. To be widely adopted. this process requires cost-effective solutions to running electrochemical reactions. An open challenge is finding low-cost electrocatalysts to drive these reactions at high rates. Through the use of quantum mechanical simulations (density functional theory). new catalyst structures can be tested and evaluated. Unfortunately. the high computational cost of these simulations limits the number of structures that may be tested. The use of machine learning may provide a method to efficiently approximate these calculations. leading to new approaches in finding effective electrocatalysts. In this paper. we provide an introduction to the challenges in finding suitable electrocatalysts. how machine learning may be applied to the problem. and the use of the Open Catalyst Project OC20 dataset for model training.,True,wKzYjksAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09435,689650766234411973,/scholar?cites=689650766234411973,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09435,0,0,0

1282713,ECG arrhythmia classification using transfer learning from 2-dimensional deep CNN features,2018,Milad Salem and Shayan Taheri and Jiann–Shiun Yuan,,,,1-4,IEEE,Due to the recent advances in the area of deep learning. it has been demonstrated that a deep neural network. trained on a huge amount of data. can recognize cardiac arrhythmias better than cardiologists. Moreover. traditionally feature extraction was considered an integral part of ECG pattern recognition; however. recent findings have shown that deep neural networks can carry out the task of feature extraction directly from the data itself. In order to use deep neural networks for their accuracy and feature extraction. high volume of training data is required. which in the case of independent studies is not pragmatic. To arise to this challenge. in this work. the identification and classification of four ECG patterns are studied from a transfer learning perspective. transferring knowledge learned from the image classification domain to the ECG signal classification domain.

1282714,Utilizing transfer learning and homomorphic encryption in a privacy preserving and secure biometric recognition system,2019,Milad Salem and Shayan Taheri and Jiann-Shiun Yuan,8,Computers,1,3,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Biometric verification systems have become prevalent in the modern world with the wide usage of smartphones. These systems heavily rely on storing the sensitive biometric data on the cloud. Due to the fact that biometric data like fingerprint and iris cannot be changed. storing them on the cloud creates vulnerability and can potentially have catastrophic consequences if these data are leaked. In the recent years. in order to preserve the privacy of the users. homomorphic encryption has been used to enable computation on the encrypted data and to eliminate the need for decryption. This work presents DeepZeroID: a privacy-preserving cloud-based and multiple-party biometric verification system that uses homomorphic encryption. Via transfer learning. training on sensitive biometric data is eliminated and one pre-trained deep neural network is used as feature extractor. By developing an exhaustive search algorithm. this feature extractor is applied on the tasks of biometric verification and liveness detection. By eliminating the need for training on and decrypting the sensitive biometric data. this system preserves privacy. requires zero knowledge of the sensitive data distribution. and is highly scalable. Our experimental results show that DeepZeroID can deliver 95.47% F1 score in the verification of combined iris and fingerprint feature vectors with zero true positives and with a 100% accuracy in liveness detection.

This generation capability can be general while the networks gain deep understanding regarding the data distribution. In many domains. this data distribution consists of anomalies and normal data. with the anomalies commonly occurring relatively less. creating datasets that are imbalanced. The capabilities that generative adversarial networks offer can be leveraged to examine these anomalies and help alleviate the challenge that imbalanced datasets propose via creating synthetic anomalies.

The emergence of the Internet of Things has aggregated this growth. Lack of security in an IoT world makes these devices hot targets for cyber criminals to perform their malicious actions. One of these actions is the Botnet attack. which is one of the main destructive threats that has been evolving since 2003 into different forms. This attack is a serious threat to the security and privacy of information. Its scalability. structure. strength. and strategy are also under successive development. and that it has survived for decades. A bot is defined as a software application that executes a number of automated tasks (simple but structurally repetitive) over the Internet. Several bots make a botnet that infects a number of devices and communicates with their controller called the botmaster to get their instructions. A botnet executes tasks with a rate that would be impossible to be done by a human being. Nowadays. the activities of bots are concealed in between the normal web flows and occupy more than half of all web traffic. The largest use of bots is in web spidering (web crawler). in which an automated script fetches. analyzes. and files information from web servers. They also contribute to other attacks. such as distributed denial of service (DDoS). SPAM. identity theft. phishing. and espionage. A number of botnet detection techniques have been proposed. such as honeynet-based and Intrusion Detection System (IDS)-based. These techniques are not effective anymore due to the constant update of the bots and their evasion mechanisms.

These IPs can be the target of adversaries similar to their digital counterparts. In this work. we study the security aspects of a tunnel field effect transistor (TFET)-based six-bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog to digital converter (ADC) through proposing two threats and two countermeasures that target the output signals of the ADC datapath and its control unit. The datapath-based threat manipulates the exiting signals from the register file. and its countermeasure attempts to filter the ADC output based on the convention of having±1 least significant bit variation (at maximum) between the adjacent sampled data points. The control-based threat manipulates the exiting signals from the control unit. and its countermeasure is a trustworthy replication of a part of the ADC circuit that is used to provide reference data for security examination and output filtering.

The shallow neural network has the duty of data preprocessing and generating adversarial samples. The deep neural network has the duty of understanding data and information as well as detecting adversarial samples. The deep neural network gets its weights from transfer learning. adversarial training. and noise training. The system is examined on the biometric (fingerprint and iris) and the pharmaceutical data (pill image). According to the simulation results. the system is capable of improving the detection accuracy of the biometric data from 1.31% to 80.65% when the adversarial data is used and to 93.4% when the adversarial data as well as the noisy data are given to the network. The system performance on the pill image data is increased from 34.55% to 96.03% and then to 98.2%. respectively. Training on different types of noise can benefit us in detecting samples from unknown and unseen adversarial attacks. Meanwhile. the system training on the adversarial data as well as noisy data occurs only once. In fact. retraining the system may improve the performance further. Furthermore. training the system on new types of attacks and noise can help in enhancing the system performance.

1282721,A cross-layer biometric recognition system for mobile IoT devices,2018,Shayan Taheri and Jiann-Shiun Yuan,7,Electronics,2,26,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,A biometric recognition system is one of the leading candidates for the current and the next generation of smart visual systems. The visual system is the engine of the surveillance cameras that have great importance for intelligence and security purposes. These surveillance devices can be a target of adversaries for accomplishing various malicious scenarios such as disabling the camera in critical times or the lack of recognition of a criminal. In this work. we propose a cross-layer biometric recognition system that has small computational complexity and is suitable for mobile Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Furthermore. due to the involvement of both hardware and software in realizing this system in a decussate and chaining structure. it is easier to locate and provide alternative paths for the system flow in the case of an attack. For security analysis of this system. one of the elements of this system named the advanced encryption standard (AES) is infected by four different Hardware Trojansthat target different parts of this module. The purpose of these Trojans is to sabotage the biometric data that are under process by the biometric recognition system. All of the software and the hardware modules of this system are implemented using MATLAB and Verilog HDL. respectively. According to the performance evaluation results. the system shows an acceptable performance in recognizing healthy biometric data. It is able to detect the infected data. as well. With respect to its hardware results. the system may not contribute significantly to the hardware design parameters of a surveillance camera considering all the hardware elements within the device.

1282729,What is a good day for outdoor photometric stereo?,2015,Yannick Hold-Geoffroy and Jinsong Zhang and Paulo FU Gotardo and Jean-François Lalonde,,,,1-9,IEEE,Photometric Stereo has been explored extensively in laboratory conditions since its inception. Recently. attempts have been made at applying this technique under natural outdoor lighting. Outdoor photometric stereo presents additional challenges as one does not have control over illumination anymore. In this paper. we explore the stability of surface normals reconstructed outdoors. We present a data-driven analysis based on a large database of outdoor HDR environment maps. Given a sequence of object images and corresponding sky maps captured in a single day. we investigate natural factors that impact the uncertainty in the estimated surface normals. Quantitative evidence reveals strong dependencies between expected accuracy and the normal orientation. cloud coverage. and sun elevation. In particular. we show that partially cloudy days yield greater accuracy than sunny days with clear skies …,True,s88993sAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,7,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7168379/,903499937356692841,/scholar?cites=903499937356692841,,,http://disneyresearch.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20150428051427/What-is-a-Good-Day-for-Outdoor-Photometric-Stereo-Paper.pdf,0,0,0

1282730,X-hour outdoor photometric stereo,2015,Yannick Hold-Geoffroy and Jinsong Zhang and Paulo FU Gotardo and Jean-François Lalonde,,,,28-36,IEEE,While Photometric Stereo (PS) has long been confined to the lab. there has been a recent interest in applying this technique to reconstruct outdoor objects and scenes. Un-fortunately. the most successful outdoor PS techniques typically require gathering either months of data. or waiting for a particular time of the year. In this paper. we analyze the illumination requirements for single-day outdoor PS to yield stable normal reconstructions. and determine that these requirements are often available in much less than a full day. In particular. we show that the right set of conditions for stable PS solutions may be observed in the sky within short time intervals of just above one hour.

However. the feature extraction methods of existing process monitoring are not capable of extracting crucial features from these highly nonlinear data. which affects the performance of monitoring. In this paper. a novel nonlinear process monitoring method based on stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) rule is proposed. Specifically. stacked denoising autoencoder is utilized to model the nonlinear process data and automatically extract crucial features.

In this work. we present Voxel-Feature Pyramid Network. a novel one-stage 3D object detector that utilizes raw data from LIDAR sensors only. The core framework consists of an encoder network and a corresponding decoder followed by a region proposal network. Encoder extracts and fuses multi-scale voxel information in a bottom-up manner. whereas decoder fuses multiple feature maps from various scales by Feature Pyramid Network in a top-down way.

Simultaneous faults are common problems in modern industrial systems. Many fault diagnosis methods have been successfully designed for solid oxide fuel cell systems. but they only address independent faults. and only a few researchers have studied simultaneous fault diagnosis. The design of a simultaneous fault diagnosis method for solid oxide fuel cell systems remains a huge challenge. This study introduces a deep learning technology into the simultaneous fault diagnosis for the solid oxide fuel cell system and proposes a novel simultaneous fault diagnosis method on the basis of a deep learning network called stacked sparse autoencoder.

However. the features extracted by the autoencoders can hardly follow the Gaussian distribution. consequently. the control limit of the corresponding monitoring statistic can not be determined by an F or χ2 distribution. Recent improvements in the unsupervised learning domain of deep learning offer opportunities to avoid the problem. In this paper. a novel nonlinear process monitoring method based on variational autoencoder (VAE) is proposed to tackle the Gaussian assumption problem. Due to the Gaussian distribution limitation added in the hidden layer of the VAE. it can not only automatically learn the key features of the nonlinear system. but also learn features that follow the Gaussian distribution.

1282736,RangeRCNN: Towards Fast and Accurate 3D Object Detection with Range Image Representation,2020,Zhidong Liang and Ming Zhang and Zehan Zhang and Xian Zhao and Shiliang Pu,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.00206,,,,We present RangeRCNN. a novel and effective 3D object detection framework based on the range image representation. Most existing 3D object detection methods are either voxel-based or point-based. Though several optimizations have been introduced to ease the sparsity issue and speed up the running time. the two representations are still computationally inefficient. Compared to these two representations. the range image representation is dense and compact which can exploit the powerful 2D convolution and avoid the uncertain receptive field caused by the sparsity issue. Even so. the range image representation is not preferred in 3D object detection due to the scale variation and occlusion. In this paper. we utilize the dilated residual block to better adapt different object scales and obtain a more flexible receptive field on range image. Considering the scale variation and occlusion of the range image. we propose the RV-PV-BEV~(Range View to Point View to Bird's Eye View) module to transfer the feature from the range view to the bird's eye view. The anchor is defined in the BEV space which avoids the scale variation and occlusion. Both RV and BEV cannot provide enough information for height estimation. so we propose a two-stage RCNN for better 3D detection performance. The point view aforementioned does not only serve as a bridge from RV to BEV but also provides pointwise features for RCNN. Extensive experiments show that the proposed RangeRCNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI 3D object detection dataset. We prove that the range image based methods can be effective on the KITTI dataset which …,True,C1Nxx_0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,6,https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00206,8315833509388277410,/scholar?cites=8315833509388277410,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00206,0,0,0

The attention-based encoder–decoder framework has enhanced state-of-the-art image caption generation by learning where to attend of the visual field. However. there exists a problem that in some cases it ignores past attention information. which tends to lead to over-recognition and under-recognition. To solve this problem. a coverage mechanism is incorporated into attention-based image caption generation. A sequential updated coverage vector is applied to preserve the attention historical information. At each time step. the attention model takes the coverage vector as auxiliary input to focus more on unattended features. Besides. to maintain the semantics of an image. we propose semantic embedding as global guidance to coverage and attention model.

1282738,MAFF-Net: Filter False Positive for 3D Vehicle Detection with Multi-modal Adaptive Feature Fusion,2020,Zehan Zhang and Ming Zhang and Zhidong Liang and Xian Zhao and Ming Yang and Wenming Tan and ShiLiang Pu,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.10945,,,,3D vehicle detection based on multi-modal fusion is an important task of many applications such as autonomous driving. Although significant progress has been made. we still observe two aspects that need to be further improvement: First. the specific gain that camera images can bring to 3D detection is seldom explored by previous works. Second. many fusion algorithms run slowly. which is essential for applications with high real-time requirements (autonomous driving). To this end. we propose an end-to-end trainable single-stage multi-modal feature adaptive network in this paper. which uses image information to effectively reduce false positive of 3D detection and has a fast detection speed. A multi-modal adaptive feature fusion module based on channel attention mechanism is proposed to enable the network to adaptively use the feature of each modal. Based on the above mechanism. two fusion technologies are proposed to adapt to different usage scenarios: PointAttentionFusion is suitable for filtering simple false positive and faster; DenseAttentionFusion is suitable for filtering more difficult false positive and has better overall performance. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate significant improvement in filtering false positive over the approach using only point cloud data. Furthermore. the proposed method can provide competitive results and has the fastest speed compared to the published state-of-the-art multi-modal methods in the KITTI benchmark.,True,C1Nxx_0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10945,9361354951814178664,/scholar?cites=9361354951814178664,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10945,0,0,0

Because of the great success of deep learning in a variety of practical applications. it has recently become the most popular approach in machine learning. Deep learning employs a hierarchical structure to learn the inherent features in systems layer by layer.

1282745,Topics in Statistical Learning with a Focus on Large-scale Data,2018,Ya Le,,,,,,"The widespread of modern information technologies to all spheres of society leads to a dramatic increase of data flow. including formation of"" big data"" phenomenon. Big data are data on a massive scale in terms of volume. intensity. and complexity that exceed the ability of traditional statistical methods and standard tools. When the size of the data becomes extremely large. it may be too long to run the computing task. and even infeasible to store all of the data on a single computer. Therefore. it is necessary to turn to distributed architectures and scalable statistical methods. Big data vary in shape and call for different approaches. One type of big data is the tall data. ie. a very large number of samples but not too many features. Chapter 1 describes a general communication-efficient algorithm for distributed statistical learning on this type of big data. Our algorithm distributes the samples uniformly to multiple machines. and uses a common reference data to improve the performance of local estimates. Our algorithm enables potentially much faster analysis. at a small cost to statistical performance. The results in this chapter are joint work with Trevor Hastie and Edgar Dobriban. and will appear in a future publication.Another type of big data is the wide data. ie. too many features but a limited number of samples. It is also called high-dimensional data. to which many classical statistical methods are not applicable.

Leskovec et al.[2] defines an unsupervised model to identify a user’s social circles. However. in real life users have personal preferences about how to group their friends. Indeed. it is possible that two users have exactly the same social networks but categorize their friends differently. In such case. unsupervised methods will fail to capture such personal preferences as they don’t incorporate information about what kinds of social circles the user finds valuable. In this paper. we develop a supervised model for detecting social circles that combines network structure as well as user information.

If such information could be determined immediately. timely evacuations and emergency actions could be undertaken to mitigate earthquake damage. Current advanced methods can report the initial location and magnitude of an earthquake within a few seconds. but estimating the source-focal mechanism may require minutes to hours. Here we present an earthquake search engine. similar to a web search engine. that we developed by applying a computer fast search method to a large seismogram database to find waveforms that best fit the input data.

However. such information is critical for monitoring seismic activity and assessing potential hazards. In particular. earthquakes caused by industrial injection have become a public concern. and regulators need a solid capability for estimating small earthquakes that may trigger the action requirements for operators to follow in real time. In this study. we develop a fully convolutional network and locate earthquakes induced during oil and gas operations in Oklahoma with data from 30 network stations. The network is trained by 1.013 cataloged events (M L≥ 3.0) as base data along with augmented data accounting for smaller events (3.0> M L≥ 0.5). and the output is a 3D volume of the event location probability in the Earth.

However. the Tikhonov regularization for traveltime tomography often produces a low-resolution velocity model. To sharpen the velocity edges for the traveltime tomographic results and fit data at the same time. we should apply the edge-preserving concepts to regularize the inversion. In this study. we develop a new model regularization method by introducing an edge-preserving smoothing operator to detect the model edges in traveltime tomography. This edge-preserving smoothing operator is previously used in processing seismic images for enhancing resolution. We design three synthetic velocity models with sharp interfaces and with or without velocity gradients to study the performance of the regularization method with the …,True,wmjc8uoAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,10,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117300630,13368966093115048252,/scholar?cites=13368966093115048252,,,,0,0,0

We first calculate the full waveforms of all possible microseismic events over a 3D grid with a known velocity model for a given acquisition geometry to create a database.

Over the past few decades. regularized iterative methods. such as traveltime and waveform inversions. have been presented to monitor velocity changes. Due to high processing cost. these iterative methods have been hardly used in practice to investigate the subsurface velocity changes in real time. In this study. we propose a new time-lapse imaging technique that effectively eliminates these limitations and directly produces accurate velocity changes from the time-lapse data. The approach uses a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) to perform the inverse problem. The network architecture consists of a contracting path to quickly extract the features of waveform data and a symmetric expanding path to yield an accurate velocity model.

1282754,Edge preserving regularization for seismic traveltime tomography,2012,Xiong Zhang and Jie Zhang,,,,1-5,Society of Exploration Geophysicists,We compare several regularization methods for traveltime tomography and present two improved methods for edge preserving regularizations. We could use a L2 norm of the model gradient or curvature as a part of the objective function to yield a smooth model solution. but the sharp edges of the model are often blurred. One way to generate a blocky model is to apply the L1 norm of the model gradient so that the model gradient is sparse. If we intend to preserve the sharp edges of the model and maintain smoothness elsewhere. then the edge preserving regularization with spatial variance is needed. We achieve that by introducing an edge preserving smoothing operator from seismic data processing to tomography. The improved methods for edge preserving regularization can make the model gradient sparser on the edge and decrease the impacts on the smoothness of non-edge area compared with the previous …,True,wmjc8uoAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,6,https://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/segam2012-0571.1,11323949991662296099,/scholar?cites=11323949991662296099,,,,0,0,0

With given P- and S-velocity models. the method inverts three component data and iteratively updates event location and source moment tensor solutions. Unlike inverting seismic data from controlled sources. we must infer origin time of microseismic events during inversion in order to match waveform properly. This is solved by calculating cross correlation of the input and synthetic waveform envelopes and extracting time shifts during each inversion iteration. Because the values of location and moment tensor parameters are not in the same order. we apply a scaling factor to adjust the updates so that they both can be resolved.

1282766,Collage CNN for Renal Cell Carcinoma Detection from CT,2017,Mohammad Arafat Hussain and Alborz Amir-Khalili and Ghassan Hamarneh and Rafeef Abugharbieh,,,,229-237,Springer,Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common malignancy that accounts for a steadily increasing mortality rate worldwide. Widespread use of abdominal imaging in recent years. mainly CT and MRI. has significantly increased the detection rates of such cancers. However. detection still relies on a laborious manual process based on visual inspection of 2D image slices. In this paper. we propose an image collage based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for automatic detection of pathological kidneys containing RCC. Our collage approach overcomes the absence of slice-wise training labels. enables slice-reshuffling based data augmentation. and offers favourable training time and performance compared to 3D CNNs. When validated on clinical CT datasets of 160 patients from the TCIA database. our method classified RCC cases vs. normal kidneys with 98% accuracy.,True,lwIopG4AAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,4,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67389-9_27,18315669186030039360,/scholar?cites=18315669186030039360,,,https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~hamarneh/ecopy/miccai_mlmi2017.pdf,0,0,0

This high resolution intra-operative imaging modality enables the reconstruction of 3D soft-tissue surface geometry with the help of computer vision techniques. This reconstructed surface is a prerequisite for many clinical applications such as image-guidance with cross-modality registration. telestration. expansion of the surgical scene by stitching/mosaicing. and collision detection. Reconstructing the surface geometry from camera information alone remains a very challenging problem in RALS mainly due to a small baseline between the optical centres of the cameras. presence of blood and smoke. specular highlights. occlusion. and smooth/textureless regions.

In this context. deformable image registration can increase the accuracy of dosimetric evaluations. provided that one can account for the uncertainties associated with the registration process.

Most vessel segmentation techniques ignore the characteristic pulsatile motion of vessels in that formulation. In a recent effort to automatically segment vessels that are hidden under fat. we motivated the use of the magnitude of local pulsatile motion extracted from surgical endoscopic video. In this paper we propose a new approach that leverages the local orientation. in addition to magnitude of motion. and demonstrate that the extended computation of motion vectors can improve the segmentation of vascular structures.

In particular. we propose the application of a Barzilai–Borwein (BB) update step in five variants for the classic Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. The evaluation is designed to check the effectiveness of the proposed methods in large scale scenarios in terms of execution time. convergence and sensitivity to the choice of initial parameters. The obtained results are compared with those obtained for well-known linear SVM algorithms and they indicate that the level of convergence of the proposed methods is very similar to that found in the other studies.

Heidelberg,The SVM algorithm is one of the most frequently used methods for the classification process. For many domains. where the classification problems have many features as well as numerous instances. classification is a difficult and time-consuming task. For this reason. the following paper presents the CSR-GPU-SVM algorithm which accelerates SVM training for large and sparse problems with the use of the CUDA technology. Implementation is based on the SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) algorithm and utilizes the CSR(Compressed Sparse Row) sparse matrix format. The proposed solution allows us to perform efficient classification of big datasets. for example rcv1 and newsgroup20. for which classification with dense representation is not possible.

We further propose that a Finite State Automata (FSA) based reliability model can serve as a befitting solution to all existing software reliability challenges. The proposed model estimates actual system reliability at runtime.

The paper presents a hybrid approach that is an amalgamation of algorithmic (parametric models) and non-algorithmic (expert estimation) models. Algorithmic model uses COCOMO II while non algorithmic utilizes Neuro-Fuzzy technique that can be further used to estimate accuracy in irregular functions. For generalization of the model. Neuro-fuzzy membership functions have been used and simulated using mathematical tool MATLAB. Also. the proposed model has been validated with traditional COCOMO model (COCOMO 81) by using NASA software project data.

1282787,Estimating Software Reliability by Monitoring Software Execution through OpCode,2015,Ritika Wason and A. K. Soni and M. Qasim Rafiq,7,International Journal of Information Technology and Computer Science,9,23-30,MECS,Previous studies on estimating software reliability employed statistical functions for next system failure prediction. These models used parameters based on assumptions regarding the nature of software faults and debugging process. However. none of the existing models. attempted on ensuring reliable runtime system operation. To serve the current demand of autonomous. reliable. service-oriented software. we present a novel approach for runtime reliability estimation of executable software. The approach can help control software execution at runtime by monitoring software state-to-state transition at runtime. The approach involves representing executable software as an automata using opcode extracted from executable code. The extracted opcode is then used to learn stochastic finite state machine (SFSM) representation of executable software which is later employed to trace software state-to-state transition at each runtime instance. An evaluation of our approach on Java-based Chart generator application is also discussed to explain how we can ensure reliable software execution and prevent software failures at runtime with the proposed approach.,True,uNwexawAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,5,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1010.8510&rep=rep1&type=pdf,8267516935358710410,/scholar?cites=8267516935358710410,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1010.8510&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Efficient utilization of limited radio frequency spectrum is only possible to use smart/adaptive antenna system. Smart antenna radiates not only narrow beam towards desired users exploiting signal processing capability but also places null towards interferers. thus optimizing the signal quality and enhancing capacity. We analysis the performance of adaptive (LMS) algorithm for smart antenna systems which very important for smart antenna design.

View synthesis techniques suffer from poor rendering quality due to holes created by occlusion and rounding integer error through warping. To remove the holes in the virtual view. the existing techniques use spatial and temporal correlation in intra/inter-view images and depth maps. However. they still suffer quality degradation in the boundary region of foreground and background areas due to the low spatial correlation in texture images and low correspondence in inter-view depth maps. To overcome the above-mentioned limitations. we use a number of models in the Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) to separate background and foreground pixels in our proposed technique.

If true. this hypothesis may have practical value in allocating resources to particular patients while using a relatively inexpensive imaging technique. The difficulty of testing such a hypothesis comes from the need for large sets of labelled data. which not only need to be well-annotated but also should contemplate the post-imaging severity outcome. On this account. this paper presents a methodology for extracting features from a limited data set with outcome label (patient required ICU admission or not) and correlating its significance to an additional. larger data set with hundreds of images. The methodology employs a neural network trained to recognise lung pathologies to extract the semantic features. which are then analysed with a shallow decision tree to limit overfitting while increasing interpretability. This analysis points out that only a few features explain most of the variance between patients that developed severe symptoms. When applied to an unrelated. larger data set with labels extracted from clinical notes. the method classified distinct sets of samples where there was a much higher frequency of labels such asConsolidation'.Effusion'. andalveolar'. A further brief analysis on the locations of such labels also showed a significant increase in the frequency of words likebilateral'.middle'. andlower'in patients classified as with higher chances of going severe. The methodology for dealing with the lack of specific ICU label data while attesting correlations with a data set containing text notes is novel; its results suggest …,True,1aeRJaEAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12597,18376995443187460505,/scholar?cites=18376995443187460505,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12597,0,0,0

To provide this luxury. a large number of high quality views have to be synthesised from limited number of viewpoints. However. in this process. a portion of the background is occluded by the foreground object in the generated synthesised videos. Recent techniques. i.e. view synthesized prediction using Gaussian model (VSPGM) and adaptive weighting between warped and learned foregrounds indicate that learning techniques may fill occluded areas almost correctly. However. these techniques use temporal correlation by assuming that original texture of the target viewpoint are already available to fill up occluded areas which is not a practical solution.

We begin by summarizing work on the phylogenetic distribution of proteins. as this will directly impact which domain architectures can be formed in different species. Studies relating domain family size to occurrence have shown that they generally follow power law distributions. both within genomes and larger evolutionary groups. These findings were subsequently extended to multi-domain architectures. Genome evolution models that have been suggested to explain the shape of these distributions are reviewed. as well as evidence for selective pressure to expand certain domain families more than others. Each domain has an intrinsic combinatorial propensity. and the effects of this have been studied using measures of domain versatility or promiscuity.

An increasingly popular way of representing and analyzing such data is by means of association networks. Ideally. such a network can be interpreted in terms of the underlying biology. A property of chromatography-based metabolomics data is that the measurement error structure is complex: apart from the usual (random) instrumental error there is also correlated measurement error. This is intrinsic to the way the samples are prepared and the analyses are performed and cannot be avoided. The impact of correlated measurement errors on (partial) correlation networks can be large and is not always predictable.

1282832,Domainoid: domain-oriented orthology inference,2019,Emma Persson and Mateusz Kaduk and Sofia K Forslund and Erik LL Sonnhammer,20,BMC bioinformatics,1,1-12,BioMed Central,Orthology inference is normally based on full-length protein sequences. However. most proteins contain independently folding and recurring regions. domains. The domain architecture of a protein is vital for its function. and recombination events mean individual domains can have different evolutionary histories. It has previously been shown that orthologous proteins may differ in domain architecture. creating challenges for orthology inference methods operating on full-length sequences. We have developed Domainoid. a new tool aiming to overcome these challenges faced by full-length orthology methods by inferring orthology on the domain level. It employs the InParanoid algorithm on single domains separately. to infer groups of orthologous domains. This domain-oriented approach allows detection of discordant domain orthologs. cases where different domains on the same protein have different evolutionary histories. In addition to domain level analysis. protein level orthology based on the fraction of domains that are orthologous can be inferred. Domainoid orthology assignments were compared to those yielded by the conventional full-length approach InParanoid. and were validated in a standard benchmark. Our results show that domain-based orthology inference can reveal many orthologous relationships that are not found by full-length sequence approaches.                                         https://bitbucket.org/sonnhammergroup/domainoid/,True,hIJH-zUAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,5,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3137-2,17764694493272364343,/scholar?cites=17764694493272364343,,,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3137-2,0,0,0

1282835,Functional Inference from Orthology and Domain Architecture,2018,Mateusz Kaduk,,,,,,Proteins are the basic building blocks of all living organisms. They play a central role in determining the structure of living beings and are required for essential chemical reactions. One of the main challenges in bioinformatics is to characterize the function of all proteins. The problem of understanding protein function can be approached by understanding their evolutionary history. Orthology analysis plays an important role in studying the evolutionary relation of proteins. Proteins are termed orthologs if they derive from a single gene in the species' last common ancestor. ie if they were separated by a speciation event. Orthologs are useful because they retain their function more often than other homologs. Inference of a complete set of orthologs for many species is computationally intensive. Currently. the fastest algorithms rely on graph-based approaches. which compare all-vs-all sequences and then cluster top hits into groups of orthologs. The initial step of performing all-vs-all comparisons is usually the primary computational challenge as it scales quadratically with the number of species.A new. more scalable and less computationally demanding method was developed to solve this problem without sacrificing accuracy. The Hieranoid 2 algorithm reduces computational complexity to almost linear by overcoming the necessity to perform all-vs-all similarity searches. The algorithm progresses along a known species tree. from leaves to root. Starting at the leaves. ortholog groups are predicted conventionally and then summarized at internal nodes to form pseudo-species. These pseudo-species are then re-used to search against other (pseudo …,True,hIJH-zUAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1200576,,,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1200576,0,0,0

1282837,Skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images with combination of YOLO and grabcut algorithm,2019,Halil Murat Ünver and Enes Ayan,9,Diagnostics,3,72,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Skin lesion segmentation has a critical role in the early and accurate diagnosis of skin cancer by computerized systems. However. automatic segmentation of skin lesions in dermoscopic images is a challenging task owing to difficulties including artifacts (hairs. gel bubbles. ruler markers). indistinct boundaries. low contrast and varying sizes and shapes of the lesion images. This paper proposes a novel and effective pipeline for skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images combining a deep convolutional neural network named as You Only Look Once (YOLO) and the GrabCut algorithm. This method performs lesion segmentation using a dermoscopic image in four steps: 1. Removal of hairs on the lesion. 2. Detection of the lesion location. 3. Segmentation of the lesion area from the background. 4. Post-processing with morphological operators. The method was evaluated on two publicly well-known datasets. that is the PH2 and the ISBI 2017 (Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection Challenge Dataset). The proposed pipeline model has achieved a 90% sensitivity rate on the ISBI 2017 dataset. outperforming other deep learning-based methods. The method also obtained close results according to the results obtained from other methods in the literature in terms of metrics of accuracy. specificity. Dice coefficient. and Jaccard index.

Various machine learning algorithms are used for distinguishing benign lesions from malignant such as deep learning. To obtain successful result from deep learning. large and quality training data set is essential. But. existing data sets maybe insufficient for training a deep learning network. Building a powerful classifier from insufficient data. data augmentation methods are useful. In this article the same network trained with augmented skin lesion images and non- augmented skin lesion images for detecting malignant skin lesions.

An effective approach to compensate for this requirement is Multi-Task Learning (MTL) to leverage different linguistic resources as a source of inductive bias. Current MTL architectures are based on the Seq2Seq transduction. and (partially) share different components of the models among the tasks. However. this MTL approach often suffers from task interference and is not able to fully capture commonalities among subsets of tasks. We address this issue by extending the recurrent units with multiple “blocks” along with a trainable “routing network”. The routing network enables adaptive collaboration by dynamic sharing of blocks conditioned on the task at hand. input. and model state. Empirical evaluation of two low-resource translation tasks.

Multi-task learning is an elegant approach to inject linguistic-related inductive biases into NMT. using auxiliary syntactic and semantic tasks. to improve generalisation. The challenge. however. is to devise effective training schedules. prescribing when to make use of the auxiliary tasks during the training process to fill the knowledge gaps of the main translation task. a setting referred to as biased-MTL. Current approaches for the training schedule are based on hand-engineering heuristics. whose effectiveness vary in different MTL settings. We propose a novel framework for learning the training schedule. ie learning to multi-task learn. for the MTL setting of interest. We formulate the training schedule as a Markov decision process which paves the way to employ policy learning methods to learn the scheduling policy. We effectively and efficiently learn the training schedule policy within the imitation learning framework using an oracle policy algorithm that dynamically sets the importance weights of auxiliary tasks based on their contributions to the generalisability of the main NMT task.

1282856,Adaptively scheduled multitask learning: The case of low-resource neural machine translation,2019,Poorya Zaremoodi and Gholamreza Haffari,,,,177-186,,Neural Machine Translation (NMT). a data-hungry technology. suffers from the lack of bilingual data in low-resource scenarios. Multitask learning (MTL) can alleviate this issue by injecting inductive biases into NMT. using auxiliary syntactic and semantic tasks. However. an effective\emph {training schedule} is required to balance the importance of tasks to get the best use of the training signal. The role of training schedule becomes even more crucial in\emph {biased-MTL} where the goal is to improve one (or a subset) of tasks the most. eg translation quality. Current approaches for biased-MTL are based on brittle\emph {hand-engineered} heuristics that require trial and error. and should be (re-) designed for each learning scenario. To the best of our knowledge. ours is the first work on\emph {adaptively} and\emph {dynamically} changing the training schedule in biased-MTL. We propose a rigorous approach for automatically reweighing the training data of the main and auxiliary tasks throughout the training process based on their contributions to the generalisability of the main NMT task. Our experiments on translating from English to Vietnamese/Turkish/Spanish show improvements of up to+ 1.2 BLEU points. compared to strong baselines.

Managing these rules to be optimum without errors is very difficult and sometimes leads to the formation of anomalies such as redundant. correlation. and shadowing rules. This defined problem has received the attention of both the academic and industry players in finding a pragmatic solution. A lot of reasonable attempts has been made by researchers of which many resorted to the automation of the firewall rule management process. The automation is to aid determine and resolve the conflicting rules and also to reduce the load that will be on the network administrator. which almost always leads to the creation of contradictory rules. The existing literature has not focused much on the amount of time it takes to determine and resolve these anomalies. Most of the conflicting rules are as a result of the wrongful position [index] a rule may occupy in the rule list. The research proposes a contextual design of an improved firewall framework. that rest on the heuristic approach of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm to determine and assign the best position [index] to a rule and thereby improving the search and resolution of identified anomalies in a firewall rules list.

One of the very key carriers in building this good relation is employee trust. Employee and its dynamics have been widely considered for institutions such as finance. auditing. sports. but not academia. Also. the majority of the current work has focused on only one region and its social work setting on employee trust. To this extent. this research work aims to propose a theoretical framework bringing to light the factors for gaining and maintaining employee trust in academia.

In this paper. we propose a perturbation layer — a learnable pre-processing layer for low-level deep features — to enhance the discriminative ability of deep features in face PAD. The perturbation layer takes the deep features of a candidate layer in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). the corresponding hand-crafted features of an input image. and produces adaptive convolutional weights for the deep features of the candidate layer. These adaptive convolutional weights determine the importance of the pixels in the deep features of the candidate layer for face PAD. The proposed perturbation layer adds very little overhead to the total trainable parameters in the model. We evaluated the proposed perturbation layer with Local Binary Patterns (LBP). with and …,True,hDKFeWEAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,3,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885619304512,16919650368674468890,/scholar?cites=16919650368674468890,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yasar_Rehman/publication/337695932_Enhancing_deep_discriminative_feature_maps_via_perturbation_for_face_presentation_attack_detection/links/5e78800092851cf271a0c59a/Enhancing-deep-discriminative-feature-maps-via-perturbation-for-face-presentation-attack-detection.pdf,0,0,0

1282890,Improved object localization using accurate distance estimation in wireless multimedia sensor networks,2015,Yasar Abbas Ur Rehman and Muhammad Tariq and Omar Usman Khan,10,PloS one,11,e0141558,Public Library of Science,Object localization plays a key role in many popular applications of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSN) and as a result. it has acquired a significant status for the research community. A significant body of research performs this task without considering node orientation. object geometry and environmental variations. As a result. the localized object does not reflect the real world scenarios. In this paper. a novel object localization scheme for WMSN has been proposed that utilizes range free localization. computer vision. and principle component analysis based algorithms. The proposed approach provides the best possible approximation of distance between a wmsn sink and an object. and the orientation of the object using image based information.

For flying animals. turning consists of changes in (i) flight trajectory. or path of travel. and (ii) body orientation. or 3D angular position. Changes in flight trajectory can only be achieved by modulating aerodynamic forces relative to gravity. How birds coordinate aerodynamic force production relative to changes in body orientation during turns is key to understanding the control strategies used in avian maneuvering flight. We hypothesized that pigeons produce aerodynamic forces in a uniform direction relative to their bodies. requiring changes in body orientation to redirect those forces to turn. Using detailed 3D kinematics and body mass distributions. we examined net aerodynamic forces and body orientations in slowly flying pigeons (Columba livia) executing level 90° turns.

To understand how such control is achieved. we examined the underlying kinematics and resulting aerodynamic mechanisms of low speed turning flight in the pigeon (Columba livia). Three birds were trained to perform 90 deg level turns in a stereotypical fashion and detailed three-dimensional (3D) kinematics were recorded at high speeds. Applying the angular momentum principle. we used mechanical modeling based on time-varying 3D inertia properties of individual sections of the pigeon9s body to separate angular accelerations of the torso based on aerodynamics from those based on inertial effects.

Here we demonstrate that wild Anna's Hummingbirds (Calypte anna) can carry positive charges up to 800 pC while in flight (mean ± s.d.: 66 ± 129 pC). Triboelectric charging obtained by rubbing an isolated hummingbird wing against various plant structures generated charges up to 700 pC. A metal hummingbird model charged to 400 pC induced bending of floral stamens in four plants (Nicotiana. Hemerocallis.

Either aerodynamic or inertial forces generated by appendages and other structures. such as the tail. may be used to offset aerial perturbations. but these responses have not been well characterized. To better understand how hummingbirds modify wing and tail motions in response to individual gusts. we filmed Anna9s hummingbirds as they negotiated an upward jet of fast-moving air. Birds exhibited large variation in wing elevation. tail pitch and tail fan angles among transits as they repeatedly negotiated the same gust. and often exhibited a dramatic decrease in body angle (29±6 deg) post-transit.

In order to move successfully in variable conditions. many animals have evolved the ability to switch between several patterns of locomotion or gaits.

Ultimately. an estimate of the conditional probability of observed states is used as our intrinsic reward for curiosity.

1282901,The Biomechanics of Obstacle Negotiation by Hummingbirds,2016,Marc Alan Badger,,,,,,Bird flight takes various forms in nature from gliding to hovering.  While flying. birds must be agile enough to maneuver around obstacles and avoid predators. yet stable enough to navigate along an controlled path.  To better understand maneuvering in complex environments. I looked to an extreme—hummingbirds.  Hummingbirds represent the pinnacle of avian maneuverability.  In addition to being the only bird capable of continuous hovering. they also hold the fastest recorded length-specific speeds of any animal and can sustain accelerations of up to nine times the acceleration of gravity.  Hummingbirds must maneuver with great accuracy to feed on the nectar of flowers. and they must navigate between trees and branches and into and out of dense vegetation as they pursue arthropods. nest. or evade predators.  They also perform these tasks in changing and windy conditions. which can impose simultaneous demands on their flight system.  In Chapter 1 of this thesis I investigate how hummingbirds maneuver through narrow constrictions. which represent the most difficult and constraining aspect of flight through vegetation.  In Chapter 2 I report how they minimize the perturbing effects of wind gusts.  Finally. in Chapter 3 I describe novel maneuvering strategies that hummingbirds display when simultaneously confronted with high winds and narrow constrictions.Chapter 1:Many birds routinely fly fast through dense vegetation characterized by variably sized structures and voids.

A straightforward way to tackle the speech attribute detection task is to estimate DNN parameters using the mean squared error (MSE) loss function and employ a sigmoid function in the DNN output nodes. A more principled way is nonetheless to incorporate the micro-F1 measure. which is a widely used metric in the multi-label classification. into the DNN loss function to directly improve the metric of interest at training time. Micro-F1 is not differentiable. yet we overcome such a problem by casting our task under the maximal figure-of-merit (MFoM) learning framework.

This makes throat microphones potentially useful for feature extraction or speech activity detection. This paper. firstly. proposes a new prototype system for simultaneous data-acquisition of acoustic and throat microphone signals. Secondly. we study the use of this additional information for both speech activity detection. feature extraction and fusion of the acoustic and throat microphone signals.

In this paper. we propose a novel low-level representation for the motion of each joint through tracking its trajectory and segmenting it into several semantic parts called motionlets. During this process. the disturbance of noise is reduced by trajectory fitting. sampling and segmentation. Then we construct an undirected complete labeled graph to represent a video by combining these motionlets and their spatio-temporal correlations.

1282914,Towards Realistic Predictors,2018,Pei Wang and Nuno Vasconcelos,,,,,,A new class of predictors. denoted realistic predictors. is defined. These are predictors that. like humans. assess the difficulty of examples. reject to work on those that are deemed too hard. but guarantee good performance on the ones they operate on. In this paper. we talk about a particular case of it. realistic classifiers. The central problem in realistic classification. the design of an inductive predictor of hardness scores. is considered. It is argued that this should be a predictor independent of the classifier itself. but tuned to it. and learned without explicit supervision. so as to learn from its mistakes. A new architecture is proposed to accomplish these goals by complementing the classifier with an auxiliary hardness prediction network (HP-Net). Sharing the same inputs as classifiers. the HP-Net outputs the hardness scores to be fed to the classifier as loss weights. Alternatively. the output of classifiers is also fed to HP-Net in a new defined loss. variant of cross entropy loss. The two networks are trained jointly in an adversarial way where. as the classifier learns to improve its predictions. the HP-Net refines its hardness scores. Given the learned hardness predictor. a simple implementation of realistic classifiers is proposed by rejecting examples with large scores. Experimental results not only provide evidence in support of the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and the learned hardness predictor. but also show that the realistic classifier always improves performance on the examples that it accepts to classify. performing better on these examples than an equivalent nonrealistic classifier. All of these make it possible for realistic classifiers to …,True,qDqLykQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,21,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Pei_Wang_Towards_Realistic_Predictors_ECCV_2018_paper.html,9569281150558027958,/scholar?cites=9569281150558027958,,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Pei_Wang_Towards_Realistic_Predictors_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf,0,0,0

1282915,Scout: Self-aware discriminant counterfactual explanations,2020,Pei Wang and Nuno Vasconcelos,,,,8981-8990,,The problem of counterfactual visual explanations is considered. A new family of discriminant explanations is introduced. These produce heatmaps that attribute high scores to image regions informative of a classifier prediction but not of a counter class. They connect attributive explanations. which are based on a single heat map. to counterfactual explanations. which account for both predicted class and counter class. The latter are shown to be computable by combination of two discriminant explanations. with reversed class pairs. It is argued that self-awareness. namely the ability to produce classification confidence scores. is important for the computation of discriminant explanations. which seek to identify regions where it is easy to discriminate between prediction and counter class. This suggests the computation of discriminant explanations by the combination of three attribution maps. The resulting counterfactual explanations are optimization free and thus much faster than previous methods. To address the difficulty of their evaluation. a proxy task and set of quantitative metrics are also proposed. Experiments under this protocol show that the proposed counterfactual explanations outperform the state of the art while achieving speeds much faster. for popular networks.

1282917,Deliberative Explanations: visualizing network insecurities,2019,Pei Wang and Nuno Vasconcelos,,,,1372-1383,,A new approach to explainable AI. denoted deliberative explanations. is proposed. Deliberative explanations are a visualization technique that aims to go beyond the simple visualization of the image regions (or. more generally. input variables) responsible for a network prediction. Instead. they aim to expose the deliberations carried by the network to arrive at that prediction. by uncovering the insecurities of the network about the latter. The explanation consists of a list of insecurities. each composed of 1) an image region (more generally. a set of input variables). and 2) an ambiguity formed by the pair of classes responsible for the network uncertainty about the region. Since insecurity detection requires quantifying the difficulty of network predictions. deliberative explanations combine ideas from the literature on visual explanations and assessment of classification difficulty. More specifically. the proposed implementation combines attributions with respect to both class predictions and a difficulty score. An evaluation protocol that leverages object recognition (CUB200) and scene classification (ADE20K) datasets that combine part and attribute annotations is also introduced to evaluate the accuracy of deliberative explanations. Finally. an experimental evaluation shows that the most accurate explanations are achieved by combining non self-referential difficulty scores and second-order attributions. The resulting insecurities are shown to correlate with regions of attributes shared by different classes. Since these regions are also ambiguous for humans. deliberative explanations are intuitive. suggesting that the deliberative process of modern networks …,True,qDqLykQAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,4,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2630/1faf3797977adc01e0d20329c08c79f695c0.pdf,7324304608131052861,/scholar?cites=7324304608131052861,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2630/1faf3797977adc01e0d20329c08c79f695c0.pdf,0,0,0

While modern classifiers perform well on populated classes. its performance degrades significantly on tail classes. Humans. however. are less affected by this since. when confronted with uncertain examples. they simply opt to provide coarser predictions. Motivated by this. a deep realistic taxonomic classifier (Deep-RTC) is proposed as a new solution to the long-tail problem. combining realism with hierarchical predictions. The model has the option to reject classifying samples at different levels of the taxonomy. once it cannot guarantee the desired performance.

1282919,Rethinking and Improving the Robustness of Image Style Transfer,2021,Pei Wang and Yijun Li and Nuno Vasconcelos,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.05623,,,,Extensive research in neural style transfer methods has shown that the correlation between features extracted by a pre-trained VGG network has a remarkable ability to capture the visual style of an image. Surprisingly. however. this stylization quality is not robust and often degrades significantly when applied to features from more advanced and lightweight networks. such as those in the ResNet family. By performing extensive experiments with different network architectures. we find that residual connections. which represent the main architectural difference between VGG and ResNet. produce feature maps of small entropy. which are not suitable for style transfer. To improve the robustness of the ResNet architecture. we then propose a simple yet effective solution based on a softmax transformation of the feature activations that enhances their entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that this small magic can greatly improve the quality of stylization results. even for networks with random weights. This suggests that the architecture used for feature extraction is more important than the use of learned weights for the task of style transfer.,True,qDqLykQAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05623,1388867253415843451,/scholar?cites=1388867253415843451,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05623,0,0,0

Fusing multiple features is intuitively an appropriate way to better recognize actions in videos. as single type of features is not able to capture the visual characteristics sufficiently. However. most of the existing fusion methods used for action recognition fail to measure the contributions of different features and may not guarantee the performance improvement over the individual features.

1282922,Dynamic Transfer for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation,2021,Yunsheng Li and Lu Yuan and Yinpeng Chen and Pei Wang and Nuno Vasconcelos,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.10583,,,,Recent works of multi-source domain adaptation focus on learning a domain-agnostic model. of which the parameters are static. However. such a static model is difficult to handle conflicts across multiple domains. and suffers from a performance degradation in both source domains and target domain. In this paper. we present dynamic transfer to address domain conflicts. where the model parameters are adapted to samples. The key insight is that adapting model across domains is achieved via adapting model across samples. Thus. it breaks down source domain barriers and turns multi-source domains into a single-source domain. This also simplifies the alignment between source and target domains. as it only requires the target domain to be aligned with any part of the union of source domains. Furthermore. we find dynamic transfer can be simply modeled by aggregating residual matrices and a static convolution matrix.
