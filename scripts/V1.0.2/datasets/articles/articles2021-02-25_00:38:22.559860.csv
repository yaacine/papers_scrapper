1101350,The gut microbiota shapes intestinal immune responses during health and disease,2009,June L Round and Sarkis K Mazmanian,9,,5,313-323,Nature Publishing Group,Immunological dysregulation is the cause of many non-infectious human diseases such as autoimmunity. allergy and cancer. The gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of interaction between the host immune system and microorganisms. both symbiotic and pathogenic. In this Review we discuss findings indicating that developmental aspects of the adaptive immune system are influenced by bacterial colonization of the gut. We also highlight the molecular pathways that mediate host–symbiont interactions that regulate proper immune function. Finally. we present recent evidence to support that disturbances in the bacterial microbiota result in dysregulation of adaptive immune cells. and this may underlie disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. This raises the possibility that the mammalian immune system. which seems to be designed to control microorganisms. is in fact controlled by microorganisms.,True,C7T_UdYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,3942,https://www.nature.com/articles/nri2515,17337120995694504439,/scholar?cites=17337120995694504439,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4095778/,0,0,0

Shaped by evolution. this partnership has potential for symbiotic benefit. However. the identities of bacterial molecules mediating symbiosis remain undefined. Here we show that. during colonization of animals with the ubiquitous gut microorganism Bacteroides fragilis. a bacterial polysaccharide (PSA) directs the cellular and physical maturation of the developing immune system. Comparison with germ-free animals reveals that the immunomodulatory activities of PSA during B. fragilis colonization include correcting systemic T cell deficiencies and TH1/TH2 imbalances and directing lymphoid organogenesis.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate recognition of microbial patterns to eliminate pathogens. By contrast. we demonstrate that the prominent gut commensal Bacteroides fragilis activates the TLR pathway to establish host-microbial symbiosis. TLR2 on CD4+ T cells is required for B. fragilis colonization of a unique mucosal niche in mice during homeostasis. A symbiosis factor (PSA. polysaccharide A) of B. fragilis signals through TLR2 directly on Foxp3+ regulatory T cells to promote immunologic tolerance. B. fragilis lacking PSA is unable to restrain T helper 17 cell responses and is defective in niche-specific mucosal colonization.

We have identified a second sortase (SrtB) in the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus that is required for anchoring of a surface protein with a NPQTN motif. Purified SrtB cleaves NPQTN-bearing peptides in vitro. and a srtB mutant is defective in the persistence of animal infections. srtB is part of an iron-regulated locus called iron-responsive surface determinants (isd). which also contains a ferrichrome transporter and surface proteins with NPQTN and LPXTG motifs.

Sortase. a membrane protein of Staphylococcus aureus. cleaves polypeptides between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif and catalyses the formation of an amide bond between the carboxyl‐group of threonine and the amino‐group of peptidoglycan cross‐bridges. S. aureus mutants lacking the srtA gene fail to anchor and display some surface proteins and are impaired in the ability to cause animal infections. Sortase acts on surface proteins that are initiated into the secretion (Sec) pathway and have their signal peptide removed by signal peptidase.

SS18-SSX retargets BAF complexes from enhancers to broad polycomb domains to oppose PRC2-mediated repression and activate bivalent genes.

However. these techniques show imperfect sensitivity and specificity. particularly in scant tissue biopsies. Here. we expand the toolkit for rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosis by studying the expression of PAX7. a transcriptional regulator of mammalian muscle progenitor cells implicated in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays using a monoclonal anti-PAX7 antibody was used to characterize PAX7 expression in 25 non-neoplastic tissues. 109 rhabdomyosarcomas. and 697 small round blue cell or other soft tissue tumors.

Accurate classification is essential both for appropriate risk stratification and for guiding clinical management. Once classified almost exclusively based on the morphologic appearance of the tumor by light microscopy. many soft tissue sarcomas are now known to manifest recurrent patterns of genetic alterations. In addition to enabling molecular confirmation of histologic diagnoses. discovery of these recurrent genetic alterations has helped to refine existing morphologic definitions of sarcoma subtypes and even prompted the discovery of new subtypes.

A common feature of demyelinated lesions is the presence of oligodendrocyte precursors (OLPs) blocked at a premyelinating stage. However. the mechanistic basis for inhibition of myelin repair is incompletely understood. To identify novel regulators of OLP differentiation. potentially dysregulated during repair. we performed a genome-wide screen of 1040 transcription factor-encoding genes expressed in remyelinating rodent lesions.

Recently a new gene expression modulator has been identified: the microRNA or miRNA. The aim of this work is to analyze the possible role of miRNAs in multiple sclerosis. focusing on the relapse stage. We have analyzed the expression patterns of 364 miRNAs in PBMC obtained from multiple sclerosis patients in relapse status. in remission status and healthy controls. The expression patterns of the miRNAs with significantly different expression were validated in an independent set of samples. In order to determine the effect of the miRNAs. the expression of some predicted target genes of these were studied by qPCR. Gene interaction networks were constructed in order to obtain a co-expression and multivariate view of the experimental data. The data analysis and later validation reveal that two miRNAs (hsa-miR-18b and hsa-miR-599) may be relevant at the time of relapse and that another miRNA (hsa-miR-96) may be involved in remission. The genes targeted by hsa-miR-96 are involved in immunological pathways as Interleukin signaling and in other pathways as wnt signaling.

Recombinant human interferon beta (rIFNβ) is routinely used to control exacerbations in multiple sclerosis patients with only partial success. mainly because of adverse effects and a relatively large proportion of nonresponders. We applied advanced data-mining and predictive modeling tools to a longitudinal 70-gene expression dataset generated by kinetic reverse-transcription PCR from 52 multiple sclerosis patients treated with rIFNβ to discover higher-order predictive patterns associated with treatment outcome and to define the molecular footprint that rIFNβ engraves on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We identified nine sets of gene triplets whose expression. when tested before the initiation of therapy. can predict the response to interferon beta with up to 86% accuracy. In addition. time-series analysis revealed potential key players involved in a good or poor response to interferon beta.

NGF can bind independently to two different receptors. the trkA tyrosine kinase receptor and the p75 neurotrophin receptor. which are involved in many different signaling events. In addition to promoting cell differentiation survival. NGF can paradoxically be an inducer of cell death. Several receptor mediated mechanisms are proposed to explain how NGF might act as a trophic factor and as a cell killer. The survival and cell death properties of the receptors are dependent upon the relative ratio of receptors and the persistent nature of the signaling events.,True,HoBKosgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,202,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017397000362,17529641957273642088,/scholar?cites=17529641957273642088,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandra_Chittka/publication/13632326_Neurotrophin_receptors_Mediators_of_life_and_death/links/5cc83edb4585156cd7bc0a27/Neurotrophin-receptors-Mediators-of-life-and-death.pdf,0,0,0

We detected cytosolic HDAC1 in damaged axons in brains of humans with multiple sclerosis and of mice with cuprizone-induced demyelination. in ex vivo models of demyelination and in cultured neurons exposed to glutamate and tumor necrosis factor-α. Nuclear export of HDAC1 was mediated by the interaction with the nuclear receptor CRM-1 and led to impaired mitochondrial transport. The formation of complexes between exported HDAC1 and members of the kinesin family of motor proteins hindered the interaction with cargo molecules. thereby inhibiting mitochondrial movement and inducing localized beading.

Sumoylation occurs at certain internal lysine residues of target proteins via an isopeptide bond linkage. Unlike ubiquitin whose carboxyl-terminal sequence is RGG. the tripeptide at the carboxyl terminus of SUMO is TGG. The presence of the arginine residue at the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin allows tryptic digestion of ubiquitin conjugates to yield a signature peptide containing a diglycine remnant attached to the target lysine residue and rapid identification of the ubiquitination site by mass spectrometry. The absence of lysine or arginine residues in the carboxyl terminus of mammalian SUMO makes it difficult to apply this approach to mapping sumoylation sites.

Subpopulations of adult stem cells remain quiescent and reside in their specialized stem cell niches. Within the niche. they interact with a repertoire of niche components. Niche integrates signals to maintain quiescence or gear stem cells toward regeneration. Recent studies provide insights into the regulatory components of stem cell niche and their influence on residing stem cells.

The lineage progression of quiescent SC toward activation. proliferation. and differentiation during the regeneration is orchestrated by cascades of transcription factors (TFs). Here. we elucidate the function of TF Yin Yang1 (YY1) in muscle regeneration. Muscle‐specific deletion of YY1 in embryonic muscle progenitors leads to severe deformity of diaphragm muscle formation. thus neonatal death.

Considered broadly. proteomics includes: techniques for identifying proteins in a sample. detecting posttranslational modifications (changes to proteins after translation). predicting the structure and function of proteins from sequence data. and integrating information about protein sequences from different databases. The paper focuses on the ways in which recent biological findings complicate the mapping from genes to RNA to protein. The authors argue that the challenges encountered in proteomics provide a valuable lesson on the complexity of life itself. as live organisms always contradict oversimplified models of biological information flow.

Specifically. the peripheral nervous system will be at the centre of these advances. as the functions it controls in chronic diseases are extensive and its small number of fibres per nerve renders them more tractable to targeted modulation.The vision for bioelectronic medicines is one of miniature. implantable devices that can be attached to individual peripheral nerves anywhere in the viscera. extending beyond early clinical examples in hypertension2 and sleep apnoea3. Such devices will be able to decipher and modulate neural signalling patterns. achieving therapeutic effects that are targeted at single functions of specific organs.

In this assay. mice chose between two sippers. one of which dispensed water and was coupled to optogenetic activation of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and the other of which dispensed natural or artificial sweeteners. This assay measured the reward value of sweeteners relative to lick-induced optogenetic activation of DA neurons. Mice preferred optogenetic stimulation of DA neurons to sucralose. but not to sucrose. However. the mice preferred sucralose plus optogenetic stimulation versus sucrose. We found that food restriction increased the value of sucrose relative to sucralose plus optogenetic stimulation. and that leptin decreased it.

The neuronal implementation of signals that could orchestrate cortex-wide activity remains unclear. Here. we develop and apply methods for cortex-wide Ca2+ imaging in mice performing decision-making behavior and identify a global cortical representation of task engagement encoded in the activity dynamics of both single cells and superficial neuropil distributed across the majority of dorsal cortex. The activity of multiple molecularly defined cell types was found to reflect this representation with type-specific dynamics. Focal optogenetic inhibition tiled across cortex revealed a crucial role for frontal cortex in triggering this cortex-wide phenomenon; local inhibition of this region blocked both the cortex-wide response to task-initiating cues and the voluntary …,True,MblzAJYAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,175,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317303434,7594173425386890203,/scholar?cites=7594173425386890203,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317303434,0,0,0

Low glutamine in tumour core regions led to dramatic histone hypermethylation due to decreased α-ketoglutarate levels. a key cofactor for the Jumonji-domain-containing histone demethylases. Using patient-derived V600E BRAF melanoma cells. we found that low-glutamine-induced histone hypermethylation resulted in cancer cell dedifferentiation and resistance to BRAF inhibitor treatment. which was largely mediated by methylation on H3K27. as knockdown of the H3K27-specific demethylase KDM6B and the methyltransferase …,True,MblzAJYAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,152,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb3410,9526726641889357706,/scholar?cites=9526726641889357706,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5536113/,0,0,0

Further analysis of the data set revealed an increase in Prevotella spp. and a decrease in Rikenellaceae relative abundance in the transgenic animals compared to the wild type animals. By BRISK analysis. species-specific differences included an increase in Bacteroides vulgatus abundance in HLA-B27/hβ2m and hβ2m compared to wild type rats. The finding that HLA-B27 is associated with altered cecal microbiota has not been shown before and can potentially provide a better understanding of the clinical diseases associated with this gene.,True,e6eV7P4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,202,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105684,9955955319767363440,/scholar?cites=9955955319767363440,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105684,0,0,0

New insights range from an enhanced understanding of how microbes mediate digestion and disease processes (e.g.. in inflammatory bowel disease) to surprising associations with Parkinson's disease. autism. and depression. In this review. we describe how new generations of sequencing technology. analytical advances coupled to new software capabilities. and the integration of animal model data have led to these new discoveries. We also discuss the prospects for integrating studies of the microbiome. metabolome. and immune system. with the goal of elucidating mechanisms that govern their interactions.

Although obesity is a global health burden. the accumulation of abdominal visceral fat is the specific cardio-metabolic disease risk factor. Here. we explore links between the fecal microbiota and abdominal adiposity using body composition as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a large sample of twins from the TwinsUK cohort. comparing fecal 16S rRNA diversity profiles with six adiposity measures. We profile six adiposity measures in 3666 twins and estimate their heritability. finding novel evidence for strong genetic effects underlying visceral fat and android/gynoid ratio. We confirm the association of lower diversity of the fecal microbiome with obesity and adiposity measures. and then compare the association between fecal microbial composition and the adiposity phenotypes in a discovery subsample of twins. We identify associations between the relative abundances of fecal microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and abdominal adiposity measures. Most of these results involve visceral fat associations. with the strongest associations between visceral fat and Oscillospira members. Using BMI as a surrogate phenotype. we pursue replication in independent samples from three population-based cohorts including American Gut. Flemish Gut Flora Project and the extended TwinsUK cohort.

While genetic and environmental factors can influence amyloid formation. molecular triggers and/or facilitators are not well defined. Growing evidence suggests that non-identical amyloid proteins may accelerate reciprocal amyloid aggregation in a prion-like fashion. While humans encode ~30 amyloidogenic proteins. the gut microbiome also produces functional amyloids. For example. curli are cell surface amyloid proteins abundantly expressed by certain gut bacteria. In mice overexpressing the human amyloid α-synuclein (αSyn). we reveal that colonization with curli-producing Escherichia coli promotes αSyn pathology in the gut and the brain. Curli expression is required for E. coli to exacerbate αSyn-induced behavioral deficits. including intestinal and motor impairments. Purified curli subunits accelerate αSyn aggregation in biochemical assays. while oral treatment of mice with a gut-restricted amyloid inhibitor prevents curli-mediated acceleration of pathology and behavioral abnormalities. We propose that exposure to microbial amyloids in the gastrointestinal tract can accelerate αSyn aggregation and disease in the gut and the brain.,True,e6eV7P4AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,41,https://elifesciences.org/articles/53111,6011458671037991868,/scholar?cites=6011458671037991868,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/53111.pdf,0,0,0

We identified quiescence-specific miRNAs in the satellite-cell lineage by microarray analysis. Among these. miRNA-489 (miR-489) is highly expressed in quiescent satellite cells and is quickly downregulated during satellite-cell activation. Further analysis revealed that miR-489 functions as a regulator of satellite-cell quiescence. as it post …,True,TCrUu9wAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C,388,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10834,6639373518221633988,/scholar?cites=6639373518221633988,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3292200/,0,0,0

STAT3 can act as an oncogene. and its function has been shown to be critical for cellular transformation by a number of oncogenic tyrosine kinases. The role of STAT3 as a DNA-binding transcription factor naturally depends on its ability to gain entrance to the nucleus. In this study. we provide evidence that STAT3 is distinct from previously characterized STAT molecules in that it dynamically shuttles between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments and maintains prominent nuclear presence. Although tyrosine phosphorylation is required for STAT3 to bind to specific DNA target sites. nuclear import takes place constitutively and independently of tyrosine phosphorylation.

However. limited strategies are available for therapeutic modulation of stem cell function during aging. Using skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) as a model system. we identify cell death by mitotic catastrophe as a cause of impaired stem cell proliferative expansion in aged animals. The mitotic cell death is caused by a deficiency in Notch activators in the microenvironment. We discover that ligand-dependent stimulation of Notch activates p53 in MuSCs via inhibition of Mdm2 expression through Hey transcription factors during normal muscle regeneration and that this pathway is impaired in aged animals. Pharmacologic activation of p53 promotes the expansion of aged MuSCs in vivo.

We therefore investigated the time course and cell-specificity of TGFβ signaling after stroke. and whether its signaling pattern is altered by gender and aging. We performed distal middle cerebral artery occlusion strokes on 5 and 18 month old TGFβ reporter mice to get a readout of TGFβ responses after stroke in real time. To determine which cell type is the source of increased TGFβ production after stroke. brain sections were stained with an anti-TGFβ antibody. colocalized with markers for reactive astrocytes. neurons. and activated microglia. To determine which cells are responding to TGFβ after stroke. brain sections were double-labelled with anti-pSmad2. a marker of TGFβ signaling. and markers of neurons. oligodendrocytes. endothelial cells. astrocytes and microglia. TGFβ signaling increased 2 fold after stroke. beginning on day 1 and peaking on day 7. This pattern of increase was preserved in old animals and absolute TGFβ signaling in the brain increased with age. Activated microglia and macrophages were the predominant source of increased TGFβ after stroke and astrocytes and activated microglia and macrophages demonstrated dramatic upregulation of TGFβ signaling after stroke.

Although not all astrocytic responses reduce inflammation. their predominant function is to protect the brain by driving the system back to homeostasis after injury. They receive multidimensional signals within the central nervous system and between the brain and the systemic circulation. Processing this information allows astrocytes to regulate synapse formation and maintenance. cerebral blood flow. and blood–brain barrier integrity. Similarly. in response to stroke and other central nervous system disorders. astrocytes detect and integrate signals of neuronal damage and inflammation to regulate the neuroinflammatory response.

It remains unclear how these stressors individually or in combination impact the central nervous system (CNS). presenting potential obstacles for astronauts engaged in deep space travel. Although human spaceflight research only within the last decade has started to include the effects of radiation transmitted by galactic cosmic rays to the CNS. radiation is currently considered to be one of the main stressors for prolonged spaceflight and deep space exploration. Here we will review the current knowledge of CNS damage caused by simulated space radiation with an emphasis on neuronal and glial responses along with cognitive functions. Furthermore. we will present novel experimental approaches to integrate the knowledge into more comprehensive studies. including multiple stressors at once and potential translation to human functions.

Inappropriate response to infant crying can hinder social development in infants. In rodents. the pup-mother interaction largely depends on pup's calls. Mouse pups emit high frequency to ultrasonic vocalization (2–90 kHz) to communicate with their dam for maternal care. However. little is known about how the maternal response to infant crying or pup calls affects social development over the long term.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we used mice lacking acid-sensing ion channel 3 (Asic3−/−) to create a hearing deficit to probe the effect of caregiver hearing on maternal care and adolescent social development. Female Asic3−/− mice showed elevated hearing thresholds for low to ultrasonic frequency (4–32 kHz) on auditory brain stem response. which thus hindered their response to their pups' wriggling calls and ultrasonic vocalization. as well as their retrieval of pups. In adolescence. pups reared by Asic3−/− mice showed a social deficit in juvenile social behaviors as compared with those reared by wild-type or heterozygous dams. The social-deficit phenotype in juvenile mice reared by Asic3−/− mice was associated with the reduced serotonin transmission of the brain. However. Asic3−/− pups cross-fostered to wild-type dams showed rescued social deficit.

We speculate a hypothesis that stereotypic phenotype related to ASD. pareralled with striatal dysfunction. might be caused by proprioception defect in the peripheral sensory neuron origin. Herein. we investigate in depth whether and how ASIC3 is involved in the regulation of self-grooming behavior. First. we observed that Asic3 null mutant mice exhibited increased self-grooming in social interaction during juvenile stage. Similarly. they displayed increased self-grooming behavior in a novel cage in the absence of cagemate. To further understand the mechanism by which ASIC3 affects grooming behavior. we analyzed neurochemical. neuropathological and electrophysiological features in the dorsal striatum of Asic3 null mutant mice. Knockout of Asic3 increased dopamine activity and phospho-ERK immunoreactivities in the dorsal striatum. Furthermore. we detected a lower paired-pulse ratio and impaired long-term potentiation in corticostriatal circuits in Asic3 null mutant mice as compared with wild-type littermates. Moreover.

This computational holographic microscope weighs less than 145 grams with dimensions smaller than 17×6×5 cm. making it especially suitable for field settings and point-of-care use. In this lensfree imaging design. we merged a colorization algorithm with a source shifting based multi-height pixel super-resolution technique to mitigate ‘rainbow’ like colour artefacts that are typical in holographic imaging. This image processing scheme is based on transforming the colour components of an RGB image into YUV colour space. which separates colour information from brightness component of an image. The resolution of our super-resolution colour microscope was characterized using a USAF test chart to confirm sub-micron spatial resolution. even for reconstructions that employ multi-height phase recovery to handle dense and connected objects. To further demonstrate the performance of this colour microscope Papanicolaou (Pap) smears were also successfully imaged.

In addition to genetic risks. the gut microbiome differs between typically developing (TD) and ASD individuals. though it remains unclear whether the microbiome contributes to symptoms. We transplanted gut microbiota from human donors with ASD or TD controls into germ-free mice and reveal that colonization with ASD microbiota is sufficient to induce hallmark autistic behaviors. The brains of mice colonized with ASD microbiota display alternative splicing of ASD-relevant genes.

Ltd.,It is generally assumed that neurogenesis in the central nervous system ceases before or soon after birth. In the last three decades. however. several studies have reported that new neurons continue to be added into the brain of adult fish. frogs. reptiles. birds and mammals. The precursor cells that give rise to the neurons generated in adulthood are generally located in the walls of the brain ventricles. From these proliferative regions. neuronal precursors migrate toward their final targets where they differentiate; they often traverse long distances through complex brain parenchyma. The identity of the neuronal precursors in the brains of adult animals is still unknown. Experiments in adult birds suggest that proliferating radial cells may be the neuronal precursors.

Here. we examined how synapses of a single neuronal type. the granule cell in the olfactory bulb. develop during their integration into the immature circuit of the newborn and the fully mature circuit of the adult rat.

Results Five studies were included in the SRMA of Brazilian patients. Our main findings are 1) the major motivation for Brazilian patients to participate in clinical trials is altruism. 2) monetary reimbursement is the least important factor motivating Brazilian patients. 3) the major barrier for Brazilian patients to not participate in clinical trials is the fear of side effects. and 4) Brazilian patients are more likely willing to participate in clinical trials than Indians.

We explored the clinical reasoning process in a real life environment.  Method This is a qualitative study evaluating transcriptions of sixteen physicians' reasoning during appointments with patients. clinical discussions between specialists. and personal interviews with physicians affiliated to a hospital in Brazil.  Results Four main themes were identified: simple and robust heuristics. extensive use of social environment rationality. attempts to prove diagnostic and therapeutic hypothesis while refuting potential contradictions using positive test strategy. and reaching the saturation point. Physicians constantly attempted to prove their initial hypothesis while trying to refute any contradictions. While social environment rationality was the main factor in the determination of all steps of the clinical reasoning process. factors such as referral letters and number of contradictions associated with the initial hypothesis had influence on physicians' confidence and determination of the threshold to reach a final decision.  Discussion Physicians rely on simple heuristics associated with environmental factors. This model allows for robustness. simplicity. and cognitive energy saving. Since this model does not fit into current diagnostic clinical practice guidelines. we make some propositions to help its integration.,True,9GsWjkkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,19,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010265,13623924228166821503,/scholar?cites=13623924228166821503,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010265,0,0,0

Russia. India. and China) and VISTA (Vietnam. Indonesia. South Africa. Turkey. and Argentina) countries. corresponding gains in cost and enrolment efficiency quickly outpace the consonant metrics in traditional countries in North America and European Union. However. questions still remain regarding the quality of data being collected in these countries. We used ethnographic. mapping and computer simulation studies to identify/address areas of threat to near miss events for data quality in two cancer trial sites in Brazil.   Methodology/Principal Findings Two sites in Sao Paolo and Rio Janeiro were evaluated using ethnographic observations of workflow during subject enrolment and data collection. Emerging themes related to threats to near miss events for data quality were derived from observations. They were then transformed into workflows using UML-AD and modeled using System Dynamics. 139 tasks were observed and mapped through the ethnographic study. The UML-AD detected four major activities in the workflow evaluation of potential research subjects prior to signature of informed consent. visit to obtain subject´s informed consent. regular data collection sessions following study protocol and closure of study protocol for a given project.

The intention is to reduce complications and associated costs. while improving the quality of care by mandating VTE prophylaxis. We applied a system dynamics model to estimate the impact of HACS on VTE rates. and potential unintended consequences such as increased rates of bleeding and infection and decreased access for patients who might benefit from TKA.   Methods and Findings The system dynamics model uses a series of patient stocks including the number needing TKA. deemed ineligible. receiving TKA. and harmed due to surgical complication. The flow of patients between stocks is determined by a series of causal elements such as rates of exclusion. surgery and complications. The number of patients harmed due to VTE. bleeding or exclusion were modeled by year by comparing patient stocks that results in scenarios with and without HACS. The percentage of TKA patients experiencing VTE decreased approximately 3-fold with HACS. This decrease in VTE was offset by an increased rate of bleeding and infection. Moreover. results from the model suggest HACS could exclude 1.5% or half a million patients who might benefit from knee replacement through 2020.   Conclusion System dynamics modeling indicates HACS will have the intended consequence of reducing VTE rates.

1101773,Natural logic: Exploring decision and intuition,2011,Mauro Maldonato and Silvia Dell'Orco,,,,,Sussex Academic Press,"This book considers the importance of intuition and natural logic in decision-making. In everyday life. people frequently make judgments and decisions without explicitly using all the relevant information that is available. Moreover. even when people are aware of details and circumstances. they do not necessarily analyze the information at their disposal on a deeper level. nor consider this information in an explicit and logical way before making a decision. On the contrary. people often follow the very first response that comes to mind. which is usually an immediate feeling. a spontaneous idea. or a sudden emergence of a sense of"" I know what to do"" or"" This is the best choice."" This intuitive. immediate response process typically takes place without any apparent effort. If questioned. people often cannot say why they responded in this fashion. People tend to trust their intuition so frequently. simply because they are successful with it. Intuition seems to satisfy decision-making needs in many situations. In addition. there is scientific evidence that people's intuition can outperform deliberate thinking processes under specific conditions. In Natural Logic. authors Mauro Maldonato and Silvia Dell'Orco address the integration of decision-making across diverse fields. including economics. medicine. and management. They consider the concepts of heuristics and biases through which the psychology of decision-making clarifies how strategies. models. and"" cognitive shortcuts."" to which people resort in assessing situations. are exposed to frequent and substantive errors.

It was shown that X-linked genes have generated duplicate intronless gene copies (retrogenes) on autosomes due to this differentiation. However. the precise driving forces for this out-of-X gene “movement” and its evolutionary onset are not known. Based on expression analyses of male germ-cell populations. we here substantiate and extend the hypothesis that autosomal retrogenes functionally compensate for the silencing of their X-linked housekeeping parental genes during. but also after. male meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). Thus. sexually antagonistic forces have not played a major role for the selective fixation of X-derived gene copies in mammals. Our dating analyses reveal that although retrogenes were produced ever since the common mammalian ancestor. selectively driven retrogene export from the X only started later. on the placental mammal (eutherian) and marsupial (metatherian) lineages. respectively. Together. these observations suggest that chromosome-wide MSCI emerged close to the eutherian–marsupial split approximately 180 million years ago. Given that MSCI probably reflects the spread of the recombination barrier between the X and Y. crucial for their differentiation. our data imply that these chromosomes became more widely differentiated only late in the therian ancestor. well after the divergence of the monotreme lineage. Thus. our study also provides strong independent support for the recent notion that our sex chromosomes emerged. not in the common ancestor of all mammals. but rather in the …,True,U--MTO8AAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,174,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060080,7805038521072265567,/scholar?cites=7805038521072265567,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060080,0,0,0

Indeed. during late stages of spermatogenesis. protein synthesis relies on the appropriate storage of translationally inactive mRNAs in transcriptionally silent spermatids. The factors and cellular compartments regulating mRNA storage and the timing of their translation are still poorly understood. The chromatoid body (CB). that shares components with the P. bodies found in somatic cells. has recently been proposed to be a site of mRNA processing. Here. we describe a new component of the CB. the RNA binding protein HuR. known in somatic cells to control the stability/translation of AU-rich containing mRNAs (ARE-mRNAs).  Methodology/Principal Findings Using a combination of cell imagery and sucrose gradient fractionation. we show that HuR localization is highly dynamic during spermatid differentiation. First. in early round spermatids. HuR colocalizes with the Mouse Vasa Homolog. MVH. a marker of the CB. As spermatids differentiate. HuR exits the CB and concomitantly associates with polysomes. Using computational analyses. we identified two testis ARE-containing mRNAs. Brd2 and GCNF that are bound by HuR and MVH. We show that these target ARE-mRNAs follow HuR trafficking. accumulating successively in the CB. where they are translationally silent. and in polysomes during spermatid differentiation.

Kinetic studies suggest that hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4.5-diphosphate (PI-4.5-P2) is an initial event in this process. Platelets contain much larger amounts of phosphatidylinositol (PI) than PI-4.5-P2. and approximately 50% of total phosphoinositides are degraded upon stimulation. We have investigated whether degradation of PI occurs by direct phospholipase C hydrolysis or by phosphorylation to PI-4.5-P2 followed by phospholipase C action on the latter compound. When platelets are incubated for 3 min with 32Pi prior to stimulation. the phosphoinositides are labeled to different specific activities.

The traditional role ascribed to the visceral endoderm entails nutrient uptake and transport. Besides synthesizing a number of specialized proteins that facilitate uptake. digestion. and secretion of nutrients. the extraembryonic visceral endoderm coordinates blood cell differentiation and vessel formation in the adjoining mesoderm. thereby facilitating efficient exchange of nutrients and gases between the mother and embryo. Recent studies suggest that in addition to this nutrient exchange function the visceral endoderm overlying the egg cylinder stage embryo plays an active role in guiding early development. Cells in the anterior visceral endoderm function as an early organizer. Prior to formation of the primitive streak. these cells express specific gene products that specify the fate of underlying embryonic tissues.

However. a meta-analysis of 63 manipulative field studies including more than 100 exotic plant species revealed that native herbivores suppressed exotic plants. whereas exotic herbivores facilitated both the abundance and species richness of exotic plants. Both outcomes suggest that plants are especially susceptible to novel. generalist herbivores that they have not been selected to resist. Thus. native herbivores provide biotic resistance to plant invasions. but the widespread replacement of native with exotic herbivores eliminates this ecosystem service. facilitates plant invasions. and triggers an invasional “meltdown.”,True,lOhiBXAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,601,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/311/5766/1459.abstract,30953121841248341,/scholar?cites=30953121841248341,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/17770/serc_Parker_et_al_SCIENCE_2006_-_Supporting_Online_Material.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

However. reductions in herbivore diversity and abundance via disease or over-fishing may harm corals directly and may indirectly increase coral susceptibility to other disturbances.

As coral cover declines. macroalgae are becoming more common on tropical reefs. Interactions between these macroalgae and corals may alter the coral microbiome. which is thought to play an important role in colony health and survival. Together. such changes in benthic macroalgae and in the coral microbiome may result in a feedback mechanism that contributes to additional coral cover loss. To determine if macroalgae alter the coral microbiome. we conducted a field-based experiment in which the coral Porites astreoides was placed in competition with five species of macroalgae. Macroalgal contact increased variance in the coral-associated microbial community. and two algal species significantly altered microbial community composition. All macroalgae caused the disappearance of a γ-proteobacterium previously hypothesized to be an important mutualist of P. astreoides. Macroalgal contact also triggered: 1) increases or 2) decreases in microbial taxa already present in corals. 3) establishment of new taxa to the coral microbiome. and 4) vectoring and growth of microbial taxa from the macroalgae to the coral. Furthermore. macroalgal competition decreased coral growth rates by an average of 36.8%.

Unfortunately. we know relatively little about the effects of temperature on herbivory rates for most insect herbivores in a given community. Evolutionary history. adaptation to local environments. and dietary factors may lead to variable thermal response curves across different species. Here we characterized the effect of temperature on herbivory rates for 21 herbivore-plant pairs. encompassing 14 herbivore and 12 plant species. We show that overall consumption rates increase with temperature between 20 and 30 °C but do not increase further with increasing temperature. However. there is substantial variation in thermal responses among individual herbivore-plant pairs at the highest temperatures. Over one third of the herbivore-plant pairs showed declining consumption rates at high temperatures. while an approximately equal number showed increasing consumption rates. Such variation existed even within herbivore species. as some species exhibited idiosyncratic thermal response curves on different host plants.

However. individual studies suggest complex. even contradictory. relationships among nutrient availability. coral physiology. and coral growth. Here. we used meta‐analysis to establish general patterns of the impact of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on coral growth and photobiology.

Predicting the impacts of consumer losses requires knowing the level of functional diversity that exists within a consumer assemblage. In this study. we document functional diversity among nine species of parrotfishes on Caribbean coral reefs. Parrotfishes are key herbivores that facilitate the maintenance and recovery of coral-dominated reefs by controlling algae and provisioning space for the recruitment of corals. We observed large functional differences among two genera of parrotfishes that were driven by differences in diet.

When animals undergo repetitive. aggregating behavior through time. they can create nutrient hotspots where rates of biogeochemical activity are higher than those found in the surrounding environment. In turn. these hotspots can influence ecosystem processes and community structure. We examined the potential for reef fishes from the family Haemulidae (grunts) to create nutrient hotspots and the potential impact of these hotspots on reef communities. To do so. we tracked the schooling locations of diurnally migrating grunts. which shelter at reef sites during the day but forage off reef each night. and measured the impact of these fish schools on benthic communities.

Altered Carbon and Nutrient Cycling May Explain the Low Resilience of Caribbean Coral Reefs,2016,Joseph R Pawlik and Deron E Burkepile and Rebecca Vega Thurber,66,BioScience,,470-476,Oxford University Press,Coral reefs are economically important ecosystems that have suffered unprecedented losses of corals in the recent past. Why have Caribbean reefs in particular transitioned to coral-depleted systems and exhibited less coral resilience? A synthesis of recent research from diverse sources provides novel insights into the reciprocal interactions among sponges. seaweeds. and microbes. We propose that coral loss resulted in more abundant seaweeds that release dissolved organic carbon (DOC). which is consumed by sponges. Sponges return carbon to the reef but also release nutrients that further enhance seaweed growth. Both seaweeds and sponges compete for space with the remaining corals. and the cycling of carbon and nutrients alters microbial activity. with negative consequences for the coral microbiome.

However. a meta-analysis of 63 manipulative field studies including more than 100 exotic plant species revealed that native herbivores suppressed exotic plants. whereas exotic herbivores facilitated both the abundance and species richness of exotic plants. Both outcomes suggest that plants are especially susceptible to novel. generalist herbivores that they have not been selected to resist. Thus. native herbivores provide biotic resistance to plant invasions. but the widespread replacement of native with exotic herbivores eliminates this ecosystem service. facilitates plant invasions. and triggers an invasional “meltdown.”,True,QtuhiVMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,601,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/311/5766/1459.abstract,30953121841248341,/scholar?cites=30953121841248341,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/17770/serc_Parker_et_al_SCIENCE_2006_-_Supporting_Online_Material.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Unfortunately. we know relatively little about the effects of temperature on herbivory rates for most insect herbivores in a given community. Evolutionary history. adaptation to local environments. and dietary factors may lead to variable thermal response curves across different species. Here we characterized the effect of temperature on herbivory rates for 21 herbivore-plant pairs. encompassing 14 herbivore and 12 plant species. We show that overall consumption rates increase with temperature between 20 and 30 °C but do not increase further with increasing temperature. However. there is substantial variation in thermal responses among individual herbivore-plant pairs at the highest temperatures. Over one third of the herbivore-plant pairs showed declining consumption rates at high temperatures. while an approximately equal number showed increasing consumption rates. Such variation existed even within herbivore species. as some species exhibited idiosyncratic thermal response curves on different host plants.

Understanding phylogenetic relationships among species in a community has become an important component of assessing assembly processes. However. the application of evolutionary information to questions in community ecology has been limited in large part by the lack of accurate estimates of phylogenetic relationships among individual species found within communities. and is particularly limiting in comparisons between communities. Therefore. streamlining and maximizing the information content of these community phylogenies is a priority. To test the viability and advantage of a multi-community phylogeny. we constructed a multi-plot mega-phylogeny of 1.347 species of trees across 15 forest dynamics plots in the ForestGEO network using DNA barcode sequence data (rbcL. matK and psbA-trnH) and compared community phylogenies for each individual plot with respect to support for topology and branch lengths. which affect evolutionary inference of community processes. The levels of taxonomic differentiation across the phylogeny were examined by quantifying the frequency of resolved nodes throughout. In addition. three phylogenetic distance metrics that are commonly used to infer assembly processes were estimated for each plot (Phylogenetic Distance [PD]. Mean Phylogenetic Distance [MPD]. and Mean Nearest Taxon Distance [MNTD]).

1101872,Novel weapons testing: are invasive plants more chemically defended than native plants?,2010,Eric M Lind and John D Parker,5,PloS one,5,e10429,Public Library of Science,Background Exotic species have been hypothesized to successfully invade new habitats by virtue of possessing novel biochemistry that repels native enemies. Despite the pivotal long-term consequences of invasion for native food-webs. to date there are no experimental studies examining directly whether exotic plants are any more or less biochemically deterrent than native plants to native herbivores.  Methodology/Principal Findings In a direct test of this hypothesis using herbivore feeding assays with chemical extracts from 19 invasive plants and 21 co-occurring native plants. we show that invasive plant biochemistry is no more deterrent (on average) to a native generalist herbivore than extracts from native plants. There was no relationship between extract deterrence and length of time since introduction. suggesting that time has not mitigated putative biochemical novelty. Moreover. the least deterrent plant extracts were from the most abundant species in the field. a pattern that held for both native and exotic plants. Analysis of chemical deterrence in context with morphological defenses and growth-related traits showed that native and exotic plants had similar trade-offs among traits.  Conclusions/Significance Overall. our results suggest that particular invasive species may possess deterrent secondary chemistry. but it does not appear to be a general pattern resulting from evolutionary mismatches between exotic plants and native herbivores.

These viewpoints are rarely distinguished but hinge on distinct mechanisms leading to different management scenarios. To improve tests of these hypotheses of invasion success we introduce a simple mathematical framework to quantify the invasiveness of species along two axes:(i) interspecific differences in performance among native and introduced species within a region. and (ii) intraspecific differences between populations of a species in its native and introduced ranges. Applying these equations to a sample dataset of occurrences of 1.416 plant species across Europe. Argentina. and South Africa. we found that many species are common in their native range but become rare following introduction; only a few introduced species become more common. Biogeographical factors limiting spread (eg biotic resistance. time of invasion) therefore appear more common than those promoting invasion (eg enemy release). Invasiveness. as measured by occurrence data. is better explained by inter-specific variation in invasion potential than biogeographical changes in performance.

To document the long-term effects of deer browsing on plant successional dynamics. we studied the impacts of deer on both aboveground vegetation and seed bank composition in plant communities following agricultural abandonment.

As coral cover declines. macroalgae are becoming more common on tropical reefs. Interactions between these macroalgae and corals may alter the coral microbiome. which is thought to play an important role in colony health and survival. Together. such changes in benthic macroalgae and in the coral microbiome may result in a feedback mechanism that contributes to additional coral cover loss. To determine if macroalgae alter the coral microbiome. we conducted a field-based experiment in which the coral Porites astreoides was placed in competition with five species of macroalgae. Macroalgal contact increased variance in the coral-associated microbial community. and two algal species significantly altered microbial community composition. All macroalgae caused the disappearance of a γ-proteobacterium previously hypothesized to be an important mutualist of P. astreoides. Macroalgal contact also triggered: 1) increases or 2) decreases in microbial taxa already present in corals. 3) establishment of new taxa to the coral microbiome. and 4) vectoring and growth of microbial taxa from the macroalgae to the coral. Furthermore. macroalgal competition decreased coral growth rates by an average of 36.8%.

When animals undergo repetitive. aggregating behavior through time. they can create nutrient hotspots where rates of biogeochemical activity are higher than those found in the surrounding environment. In turn. these hotspots can influence ecosystem processes and community structure. We examined the potential for reef fishes from the family Haemulidae (grunts) to create nutrient hotspots and the potential impact of these hotspots on reef communities. To do so. we tracked the schooling locations of diurnally migrating grunts. which shelter at reef sites during the day but forage off reef each night. and measured the impact of these fish schools on benthic communities. We found that grunt schools showed a high degree of site fidelity. repeatedly returning to the same coral heads.

Nutrient loading may destabilise these mutualisms by altering the costs and benefits each partner incurs from interacting.

While the nascent field of coral restoration has rapidly progressed in the past decade. significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the drivers of restoration success that may impede our ability to effectively restore coral reef communities. Here. we conducted a field experiment to investigate the influence of coral density on the growth. habitat production. and survival of corals outplanted for restoration. We used nursery-raised colonies of Acropora cervicornis to experimentally establish populations of corals with either 3. 6. 12. or 24 corals within 4m2 plots. generating a gradient of coral densities ranging from 0.75 corals m-2 to 12 corals m-2.

Our data suggest that positive density dependent effects influenced habitat production at densities of 3 corals m-2. but further increases in density resulted in negative density dependent effects with decreasing growth and survivorship of corals. These findings highlight the importance of density dependence for coral restoration planning and demonstrate the need to evaluate the influence of density for other coral species used for restoration.

At the same time. the elevated temperatures increased the prevalence of Dark Spot Syndrome (DSS). a disease typically associated with cold temperatures in Siderastrea siderea corals. However. nutrient exposure alone did not increase the prevalence or severity of disease. suggesting that thermal stress overwhelms the effects of nutrient pollution on this disease during such an extreme thermal event.

Corallivores can be agents of bioerosion. can affect succession and community structure (Bellwood et al. 2003; Rotjan and Lewis 2008). and some. such as parrotfish. also consume algae that compete with corals (Mumby 2009). However. the impacts of corallivores on reefs often depend on the geomorphic or ecological context. When corallivore populations grow unchecked they can become major drivers of coral decline. For example. outbreaks of the corallivorous crown-of-thorns sea star (Acanthaster planci) are responsible for over 40% of the coral cover lost in the past three decades on the Great Barrier Reef (De’ath et al. 2012).

However. large animals are also at greater risk from human activities. Thus. it is critical to understand how losing large animals impacts ecosystem function. In the oceans. selective fishing for large animals alters the demographics and size structure of numerous species. While the community‐wide impacts of losing large animals are a major theme in terrestrial research. the ecological consequences of removing large animals from marine ecosystems remain understudied.

Ecological stoichiometry. built around the mass balance of elements. necessitates that to build tissue. maintain growth. and reproduce. animals must maintain a homeostatic balance of elements within their body. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are abundant in animal tissue relative to most plants and algae. Accordingly. N and P are often limiting for herbivores. which should therefore focus their foraging efforts on resources rich in these elements. Here. we explore how variation in N and P concentrations in algae impact herbivore resource selectivity on a coral reef.

The ionic conductance shows a three-order-of-magnitude decrease with decreasing salt concentrations from 1 M to 1 μM. strongly deviating from bulk linear behavior. The data are described by a model that accounts for a salt-dependent surface charge of the pore. Subsequently. we measure translocation of 16.5-μm-long dsDNA for 50 mM to 1 M salt concentrations. DNA translocation is shown to result in either a decrease ([KCl] > 0.4 M) or increase of the ionic current ([KCl] < 0.4 M). The data are described by a model where current decreases result from the partial blocking of the pore and current increases are attributed to motion of the counterions that screen the charge of the DNA backbone.

Supercoiling affects transcription. DNA replication. and chromosomal segregation. Consequently the cell must fine-tune supercoiling to optimize these key processes. Here. we summarize how supercoiling is generated and review experimental and theoretical insights into supercoil relaxation. We distinguish between the passive dissipation of supercoils by diffusion and the active removal of supercoils by topoisomerase enzymes. We also review single-molecule studies that elucidate the timescales and mechanisms of supercoil removal.,True,07alkr8AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,153,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867410008962,14899881732107652246,/scholar?cites=14899881732107652246,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867410008962,0,0,0

The method takes direct             advantage of back-focal-plane interferometry measuring not an absolute but a             differential position. i.e. the position of the trapped particle relative to the center             of the optical tweezers. Therefore. a fast step-wise motion of the optical tweezers             yields the impulse response of the trapped particle.

A main limiting factor for further development of fast video microscopy remains the illumination of the sample. which must deliver sufficient light to the camera to allow microsecond exposure times. Here we systematically compare the main illumination systems employed in holographic tracking microscopy. and we show that a superluminescent diode and a modulated laser diode perform the best in terms of image quality and acquisition speed. respectively. In particular. we show that the simple and inexpensive laser illumination enables less than s camera exposure time at high magnification on a large field of view without coherence image artifacts. together with a good hologram quality that allows nm-tracking of microscopic beads to be performed.

However. as oxygen is also a triplet state quencher. the result is usually an increased blinking of the fluorophore. that may be annoying for several applications such as tracking or FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer). In this context. Tinnefeld and co-workers [2] have developed a rational technique to minimize both photobleaching and blinking by removing oxygen and adding a reducing and oxidizing system (ROXS) to quench the triplet state by electron-transfer reactions. They demonstrated its high efficiency on several dye families in the yellow to red range. Extending this strategy to green dyes could be problematic since these authors also showed [7] that an excitation at 488nm. more energetic than a red one. could bring a dye from the first excited singlet or triplet state to higher excited states. susceptible to lead to increased photobleaching. Herein. we adapt this ROXS strategy to BODIPY-Fl (BFl). a green dye (excitation@ 488nm. emission@ 510nm).

DNA molecules are tightly compacted into a dynamic 3D nucleoprotein complex. In bacteria. this compaction is governed by the family of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs).

Although static structures of Dps–DNA complexes have been documented. little is known about the dynamics of their assembly.

As translating ribosomes cannot be synchronized over many elongation cycles. single-molecule studies have been introduced to bring a deeper understanding of prokaryotic translation dynamics. Extending this approach to eukaryotic translation is very appealing. but initiation and specific labeling of the ribosomes are much more complicated.

Currently. the most efficacious therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection is the Remdesivir (RDV). an adenine-like ribonucleotide analogue that is very efficiently incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase. Understanding why RDV is so well incorporated will facilitate development of even more effective therapeutics. Here. we have applied a high-throughput. single-molecule. magnetic-tweezers platform to study thousands of cycles of nucleotide addition by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase in the absence and presence of RDV. a Favipiravir-related analog (T-1106). and the endogenously produced ddhCTP. Our data are consistent with two parallel catalytic pathways of the replicase: a high-fidelity catalytic (HFC) state and a low-fidelity catalytic (LFC) state. the latter allowing the slow incorporation of both cognate and non-cognate nucleotides. ddhCTP accesses HFC. T-1106 accesses LFC as a non-cognate nucleotide. while RDV efficiently accesses both LFC pathway. In contrast to previous reports. we provide unequivocal evidence against RDV functioning as a chain terminator. We show that RDV incorporation transiently stalls the replicase. only appearing as termination events when traditional. gel-based assays are used. The efficiency of ddhCTP utilization by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase suggests suppression of its synthesis during infection. inspiring new therapeutic strategies.

While structural evidence suggests that strand separation on the blocking (non-permissive) side of Tus–Ter triggers roadblock formation. biochemical evidence indicates roles for protein–protein interactions. Here. we perform DNA unzipping experiments demonstrating that non-permissively oriented Tus–Ter forms a tight lock also in the absence of replicative proteins. Conversely. permissively oriented Tus–Ter allows nearly unhindered strand separation. We quantify the lock strength and demonstrate the existence of several intermediate lock states that are severely impacted by mutations in the Tus lock domain. but not by mutations in the Tus DNA-binding domain. Lock formation is 100% efficient and highly specific. Since these efficiencies exceed those reported for the E. coli replisome itself. we postulate that protein–protein interactions may actually disrupt rather than promote proper lock formation.,True,bKjNMuwAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,0,http://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/files/41677186/print_artikel_20150413_TusMain_final_A.pdf,,,,http://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/files/41677186/print_artikel_20150413_TusMain_final_A.pdf,0,0,0

Although these fiber networks are well characterized macroscopically. this stress generation by microscopic active units is not well understood.

The nanostructure of the Mg-Ti-Ni-H films hinders a direct determination of the hydride phases involved by x-ray diffraction. Using density functional theory calculations for various hydrogenation reaction paths. we establish that the destabilization of the Mg-Ni-H system by Ti doping is due to the formation of Mg 2 Ni and Ti-Ni intermetallics in the as-deposited state. which transform into …,True,xSgWTTQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,46,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.77.024204,4929346340159833169,/scholar?cites=4929346340159833169,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernard_Dam/publication/235553975_Highly_destabilized_Mg-Ti-Ni-H_system_investigated_by_density_functional_theory_and_hydrogenography/links/0c96052516ad0ab536000000/Highly-destabilized-Mg-Ti-Ni-H-system-investigated-by-density-functional-theory-and-hydrogenography.pdf,0,0,0
1102007,Effective-medium approach for stiff polymer networks with flexible cross-links,2009,CP Broedersz and C Storm and FC MacKintosh,79,Physical Review E,6,061914,American Physical Society,Recent experiments have demonstrated that the nonlinear elasticity of in vitro networks of the biopolymer actin is dramatically altered in the presence of a flexible cross-linker such as the abundant cytoskeletal protein filamin. The basic principles of such networks remain poorly understood. Here we describe an effective-medium theory of flexibly cross-linked stiff polymer networks. We argue that the response of the cross-links can be fully attributed to entropic stiffening. while softening due to domain unfolding can be ignored. The network is modeled as a collection of randomly oriented rods connected by flexible cross-links to an elastic continuum. This effective medium is treated in a linear elastic limit as well as in a more general framework. in which the medium self-consistently represents the nonlinear network behavior. This model predicts that the nonlinear elastic response sets in at strains proportional to cross …,True,xSgWTTQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,43,https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.79.061914,7599195381791575478,/scholar?cites=7599195381791575478,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.3946,0,0,0

The response to local forcing is non-self-averaging and fluctuates over a length scale that diverges at the jamming transition.

The coherent wave propagates linearly in time. and its amplitude and width depend as a power law on distance. while its velocity is roughly compatible with the predictions of macroscopic elasticity.

Our counting arguments for the multiplicities of these structures show that independently of the precise values of the coefficients in the equations. there generally exists a symmetric stationary source solution. which sends out waves with a unique frequency and wave number.

But granular media are different. Right when they jam. these fragile and disordered solids exhibit a vanishing rigidity and sound speed. so that even tiny mechanical perturbations form supersonic shocks.

Averaged over an ensemble of similar packings. these systems are well described by elasticity. while in single packings we determine a diverging length scale ℓ∗ up to which the response of the system is dominated by the local packing disorder.

Our presentation is centered around the concept of the asymptotic linear spreading velocity v∗. the asymptotic rate with which initially localized perturbations spread into an unstable state according to the linear dynamical equations obtained by linearizing the fully nonlinear equations about the unstable state. This allows us to give a precise definition of pulled fronts. nonlinear fronts whose asymptotic propagation speed equals v∗. and pushed fronts. nonlinear fronts whose asymptotic speed v† is larger than v∗. In addition. this approach allows us to clarify many aspects of the front selection problem. the question whether for a given dynamical equation the front is pulled or pushed.

Such fronts can occur eg. in the form of domain walls in liquid crystals. or when the dynamics of a system which is suddenly quenched into an unstable state is dominated by domain walls moving in from the boundary. It was emphasized recently by Dee et al. that for sufficiently localized initial conditions the velocity of such fronts often approaches the velocity corresponding to the marginal stability point. the point at which the stability of a front profile moving with a constant speed changes. I show here when and why this happens. and advocate the marginal stability approach as a simple way to calculate the front velocity explicitly in the relevant cases.

The term “pulled front” expresses that these fronts are “pulled along” by the spreading of linear perturbations about the unstable state. Accordingly. their asymptotic speed v* equals the spreading speed of perturbations whose dynamics is governed by the equations linearized about the unstable state. The central result of this paper is the analysis of the convergence of asymptotically uniformly traveling pulled fronts towards v*. We show that when such fronts evolve from “sufficiently steep” initial conditions. which initially decay faster than e− λ* x for x→∞. they have a universal relaxation behavior as time t→∞: the velocity of a pulled front always relaxes algebraically like v (t)= v*− 3/(2λ* t)+ 3 2 π Dλ*/(Dλ* 2 t) 3/2+ O (1/t 2).

The ionization avalanche in the tip of the wave is due to free electrons being accelerated in the strong field and ionizing the gas by impact. This chain reaction deeper in the wave is suppressed by the generated free charges screening the field.

The coherent wave propagates linearly in time. and its amplitude and width depend as a power law on distance. while its velocity is roughly compatible with the predictions of macroscopic elasticity.

We show that ω* is proportional to Δ z. the excess number of contacts per grain relative to the minimally allowed. isostatic value. For zero and infinitely large friction. typical packings at the jamming threshold have Δ z→ 0. and then exhibit critical scaling. We study the nature of the soft modes in these two limits. and find that the ratio of elastic moduli is governed by the distance from isostaticity.,True,Wr74kkEAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,159,https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.75.020301,6462214773383993368,/scholar?cites=6462214773383993368,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0510506,0,0,0
1102054,An introductory essay on subcritical instabilities and the transition to turbulence in visco-elastic parallel shear flows,2007,Alexander N Morozov and Wim van Saarloos,447,,3-6,112-143,North-Holland,This paper is an pedagogical essay on the scenario of the instabilities and the transition to turbulence in visco-elastic polymer flows. When polymers are long. they get easily stretched by the shear present in flows. and the viscosity of the solution or melt is large. As a result. inertial effects are usually negligible as the Reynolds numbers are small but the fluid is strongly nonNewtonian due to the shear-induced elasticity and anistropy. and the slow relaxation effects. The dimensionless number governing these nonNewtonian effects is the Weissenberg number Wi. From a number of precise experiments and theoretical investigations in the last fifteen years. it has become clear that as the Weissenberg number increases. visco-elastic fluids exhibit flow instabilities driven by the anisotropy of the normal stress components and the curvature of the streamlines.

Interpreting these contacts as constrained leads to a generalized concept of isostaticity. which relates the maximal fraction of fully mobilized contacts and contact number. For p→ 0. our frictional packings approximately satisfy this relation over the full range of μ. This is in agreement with a previous conjecture that gently built packings should be marginal solids at jamming.

We find that the shear response of packing-derived networks. and both the shear and compression response of randomly cut networks. are all similar: the elastic moduli vanish linearly near jamming. and distributions characterizing the local geometry of the response scale with distance to jamming. Compression of packing-derived networks is exceptional: the elastic modulus remains constant and the geometrical distributions do not exhibit simple scaling.

Here we focus on the strong-coupling limit where all holes are bound to domain walls. We assert that at high temperatures a classical domain-wall fluid is realized and show that the dynamics of such a fluid is characterized by spatial and temporal crossover scales set by temperature itself. The fundamental parameters of this fluid are such that the domain-wall motions dominate the low-frequency spin fluctuations and we derive predictions for the behavior of the dynamical magnetic susceptibility.

Cascade is a 405-kDa complex comprising five functionally essential CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins (CasA 1 B 2 C 6 D 1 E 1) and a 61-nucleotide CRISPR RNA (crRNA) with 5′-hydroxyl and 2′. 3′-cyclic phosphate termini. The crRNA guides Cascade to dsDNA target sequences by forming base pairs with the complementary DNA strand while displacing the noncomplementary strand to form an R-loop. Cascade recognizes target DNA without consuming ATP. which suggests …,True,3aBT5m4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,544,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.2019.pdf?origin=ppub,5528236089798083205,/scholar?cites=5528236089798083205,,https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/6761944/2011NatStructMolBiolJore.pdf,0,0,0

1102094,CRISPR interference directs strand specific spacer acquisition,2012,Daan C Swarts and Cas Mosterd and Mark WJ Van Passel and Stan JJ Brouns,7,PloS one,4,e35888,Public Library of Science,Background CRISPR/Cas is a widespread adaptive immune system in prokaryotes. This system integrates short stretches of DNA derived from invading nucleic acids into genomic CRISPR loci. which function as memory of previously encountered invaders. In Escherichia coli. transcripts of these loci are cleaved into small RNAs and utilized by the Cascade complex to bind invader DNA. which is then likely degraded by Cas3 during CRISPR interference.   Results We describe how a CRISPR-activated E. coli K12 is cured from a high copy number plasmid under non-selective conditions in a CRISPR-mediated way. Cured clones integrated at least one up to five anti-plasmid spacers in genomic CRISPR loci. New spacers are integrated directly downstream of the leader sequence. The spacers are non-randomly selected to target protospacers with an AAG protospacer adjacent motif. which is located directly upstream of the protospacer. A co-occurrence of PAM deviations and CRISPR repeat mutations was observed. indicating that one nucleotide from the PAM is incorporated as the last nucleotide of the repeat during integration of a new spacer. When multiple spacers were integrated in a single clone. all spacer targeted the same strand of the plasmid. implying that CRISPR interference caused by the first integrated spacer directs subsequent spacer acquisition events in a strand specific manner.   Conclusions The E. coli Type I-E CRISPR/Cas system provides resistance against bacteriophage infection. but also enables removal of residing plasmids.

Adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes are centered around repetitive loci called CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat). into which invader DNA fragments are incorporated. CRISPR transcripts are processed into small RNAs that guide CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to invading nucleic acids by complementary base pairing. However. to avoid autoimmunity it is essential that these RNA-guides exclusively target invading DNA and not complementary DNA sequences (i.e.. self-sequences) located in the host's own CRISPR locus. Previous work on the Type III-A CRISPR system from Staphylococcus epidermidis has demonstrated that a portion of the CRISPR RNA-guide sequence is involved in self versus non-self discrimination. This self-avoidance mechanism relies on sensing base pairing between the RNA-guide and sequences flanking the target DNA. To determine if the RNA-guide participates in self versus non-self discrimination in the Type I-E system from Escherichia coli we altered base pairing potential between the RNA-guide and the flanks of DNA targets. Here we demonstrate that Type I-E systems discriminate self from non-self through a base pairing-independent mechanism that strictly relies on the recognition of four unchangeable PAM sequences.

This defense system contains a unique type of repetitive DNA stretches. termed Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs). CRISPRs consist of identical repeated DNA sequences (repeats). interspaced by highly variable sequences referred to as spacers. The spacers originate from either phages or plasmids and comprise the prokaryotes’‘immunological memory’. CRISPR-associated (cas) genes encode conserved proteins that together with CRISPRs make-up the CRISPR/Cas system. responsible for defending the prokaryotic cell against invaders. CRISPR-mediated resistance has been proposed to involve three stages:(i) CRISPR-Adaptation. the invader DNA is encountered by the CRISPR/Cas machinery and an invader-derived short DNA fragment is incorporated in the CRISPR array.(ii) CRISPR-Expression. the CRISPR array is transcribed and the transcript is processed by Cas proteins.(iii) CRISPR-Interference. the invaders’ nucleic acid is recognized by complementarity to the crRNA and neutralized. An application of the CRISPR/Cas system is the immunization of industry-relevant prokaryotes (or eukaryotes) against mobile-genetic invasion.

The elongation of the RNA molecule is frequently interrupted by pauses. the detailed nature of which remains controversial. Here we ask whether backtracking. the central mechanism behind long pauses. could also be responsible for short pauses normally attributed to the ubiquitous pause state. To this end. we model backtracking as a force-biased random walk. giving rise to a broad distribution of pause durations as observed in experiments. Importantly. we find that this single mechanism naturally generates two populations of pauses that are distinct both in duration and trajectory: long-time pauses with the expected behavior of diffusive backtracks. and a new class of short-time backtracks with characteristics similar to those of the ubiquitous pause.

Here. we use a single-molecule magnetic tweezers approach to quantify the force-dependent equilibrium between DNA melting and supercoiling at high temperatures populated by Thermophiles. We show that negatively supercoiled DNA denatures at 0.5 pN lower tension at thermophilic vs. mesophilic temperatures.

Classically. transcription factors are directed to a subset of promoters via the recognition of DNA sequence motifs. However. a unique class of regulators is recruited directly through interactions with RNAP. Surprisingly. these factors may still possess promoter specificity. and it has been postulated that the same kinetic mechanism leads to different regulatory outcomes depending on a promoter’s basal rate constants. However. mechanistic studies of regulation typically report factor activity in terms of changes in the thermodynamics or kinetics of individual steps or states while qualitatively linking these observations to measured changes in transcript production.

The mechanism of biased motion exhibited by molecular motors is typically described as either a thermal ratchet or a power-stroke and nucleic acid helicases are characterized by either active or passive unwinding mechanisms.

Recent work has revealed that the transcription machinery in many bacteria diverges from the paradigm that has been established in Escherichia coli. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) encodes the RNA polymerase (RNAP)-binding protein CarD. which is absent in E. coli but is required to form stable RNAP-promoter open complexes (RPo) and is essential for viability in Mtb. The stabilization of RPo by CarD has been proposed to result in activation of gene expression; however.

Traditionally. two limiting mechanisms are considered for the association of two molecules. In a conformational selection (CS) mechanism. a ligand preferentially binds to a subset of conformations in its binding partner. In contrast. an induced fit (IF) mechanism describes the ligand-dependent isomerization of the binding partner in which binding occurs prior to conformational exchange. Measurements of the ligand concentration dependence of observed rates of relaxation are commonly used to probe whether CS or IF is taking place.

These mechanistic categories are related to transition state position: An early transition state suggests that chemical energy is stored and then released during the step (stroke) while a late transition state suggests that the release of chemical energy rectifies thermally activated motion that has already occurred (ratchet). Cellular RNA polymerases are thought to be ratchets that can push each other forward to reduce pausing during elongation. Here. by constructing a two-dimensional energy landscape from the individual landscapes of active and backtracked enzymes. we identify a new pushing mechanism which is the result of a saddle trajectory that arises in the two-dimensional energy landscape of interacting enzymes.

Therefore. to gain further insight into the role of CarD in M. tuberculosis growth and virulence. we determined the effect of increasing the affinity of CarD for RNAP.

In these complexes efficient transfer of triplets from Chl to Car occurs as a protection mechanism against singlet oxygen formation. It appears that at room temperature all triplets are being transferred from Chl to Car; at lower temperatures (77 K and below) the transfer is less efficient and chlorophyll triplets can be observed. In the presence of oxygen at room temperature the Car triplets are partly quenched by oxygen and two different Car triplet spectral species can be distinguished because of a difference in quenching rate.

The technical challenge in such an experiment is to discriminate a minute fluorescence signal from the much larger background signals caused by the trap and the fluorescence excitation laser light. We show here that this is feasible even when the fluorophore is directly attached to the trapped particle. by using optimized optical filters. We found. however. that the photostability of the fluorophores we tested suffered from the presence of the additional laser light used for trapping. We found that bleaching rates increased linearly with both the intensity of the trapping laser and the intensity of the fluorescence excitation light.

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus ST398 is prevalent in pigs in Europe and North America. However. the mechanism of successful pig colonization by MRSA ST398 is poorly understood. To study MRSA colonization in pigs. an ex vivo model consisting of porcine nasal mucosa explants cultured at an air-liquid interface was evaluated. In cultured mucosa explants from the surfaces of the ventral turbinates and septum of the pig nose no changes in cell morphology and viability were observed up to 72 h. MRSA colonization on the explants was evaluated followed for three MRSA ST398 isolates for 180 minutes. The explants were incubated with 3×108 CFU/ml in PBS for 2 h to allow bacteria to adhere to the explants surface. Next the explants were washed and in the first 30 minutes post adhering time. a decline in the number of CFU was observed for all MRSA. Subsequently. the isolates showed either: bacterial growth. no growth. or a further reduction in bacterial numbers. The MRSA were either localized as clusters between the cilia or as single bacteria on the cilia surface. No morphological changes in the epithelium layer were observed during the incubation with MRSA.

In humans nasal carriage of S. aureus is a risk factor for various infections. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus ST398 is highly prevalent in pigs in Europe and North America. The mechanism of successful pig colonization by MRSA ST398 is poorly understood. Previously. we developed a nasal colonization model of porcine nasal mucosa explants to identify molecular traits involved in nasal MRSA colonization of pigs. We report the analysis of changes in the transcription of MRSA ST398 strain S0462 during colonization on the explant epithelium. Major regulated genes were encoding metabolic processes and regulation of these genes may represent metabolic adaptation to nasal mucosa explants. Colonization was not accompanied by significant changes in transcripts of the main virulence associated genes or known human colonization factors. Here. we documented regulation of two genes which have potential influence on S. aureus colonization; cysteine extracellular proteinase (scpA) and von Willebrand factor-binding protein (vWbp. encoded on SaPIbov5). Colonization with isogenic-deletion strains (Δvwbp and ΔscpA) did not alter the ex vivo nasal S. aureus colonization compared to wild type.

1102176,Molecular and ecological aspects of MRSA ST398 colonization in pigs,2013,P Tulinski,,,,,,The aim of this thesis was to understand the successful colonization of MRSA ST398 in pigs and the factors that may contribute to this colonization. The first part describes the development and application of an ex vivo pig nasal mucosa explants model to study MRSA colonization. The second part studies the ecology of MRSA ST398. especially with respect to the possible relationship between staphylococcal flora on the generation of MRSA ST398 in the farm environment and the influence of organic husbandry on MRSA ST398 prevalence in pig farms. Pig animal models have been used to study colonization in pigs. However. these models have some disadvantages such as unstable colonization. limited bacterial detection as well as infection that may result in death of the animal. In this study the nasal mucosa explants model was investigated as a novel tool to study MRSA ST398 colonization in pigs. The cultivation of the nasal mucosa explants did not show changes in morphology and viability during cultivation of the tissue for 72h. Nasal mucosa explants. inoculated with three MRSA ST398 strains isolated from a pig carrier (S0462) and a human patient (S0385-1 and S0385-2) showed three different colonization patterns. One strains (S0462) showed significant increase of the number of bacteria. strain S0385-1 showed stable colonization whereas strain S0385-2 showed a decline of bacteria.

In protrusive structures. multiple actin filaments are arranged in cross-linked webs (as in lamellipodia or pseudopodia) or parallel bundles (as in filopodia). We have used an optical trap to directly measure the forces generated by elongation of a few parallel-growing actin filaments brought into apposition with a rigid barrier. mimicking the geometry of filopodial protrusion. We find that the growth of approximately eight actin parallel-growing filaments can be stalled by relatively small applied load forces on the order of 1 pN. consistent with the theoretical load required to stall the elongation of a single filament under our conditions.

These microtubules can operate in parallel bundles. for example when interacting with mitotic chromosomes. Here. we investigate the force-generating capabilities of a bundle of growing microtubules and study the effect that force has on the cooperative dynamics of such a bundle. We used an optical tweezers setup to study microtubule bundles growing against a microfabricated rigid barrier in vitro. We show that multiple microtubules can generate a pushing force that increases linearly with the number of microtubules present. In addition. the bundle can cooperatively switch to a shrinking state. due to a force-induced coupling of the dynamic instability of single microtubules.

We find that the filament's secondary DNA-binding site interacts with a single strand of the incoming double-stranded DNA during homology sampling. Recognition requires opening of the helix and is strongly promoted by unwinding torsional stress.

Our technique allows for increased resolution compared to that of previous methods. especially at low magnification or at high signal/noise ratio. This enables tracking with nanometer accuracy in a wide field of view and tracking of many particles. To reduce bias induced by pixelation. the tracking algorithm uses interpolation of the image on a circular grid to determine the x-. y-. and z-positions. We evaluate the proposed algorithm by tracking simulated images and compare it to well-known center-of-mass and cross-correlation methods. The final resolution of the described method improves up to an order of magnitude in three dimensions compared to conventional tracking methods.

They provide mechanical stability in stereocilia. microvilli. filopodia. stress fibers and the sperm acrosome. Bundles are typically stabilized by a wide range of specific crosslinking proteins. most of which exhibit off-rates on the order of 1s−1. Yet F-actin bundles exhibit structural and mechanical integrity on time scales that are orders of magnitude longer. By applying large deformations to reconstituted F-actin bundles using optical tweezers. we provide direct evidence of their differential mechanical response in vitro: bundles exhibit fully reversible. elastic response on short time scales and irreversible. elasto-plastic response on time scales that are long compared to the characteristic crosslink dissociation time.

For synthetic molecular mesogens. like the ones used in liquid-crystal displays. these defect structures are independent of the size of the molecules and well described by continuum theories.

These hairs are soft enough to deform in response to stresses from fluid flows. Yet fluid stresses are in turn affected by hair deformation. leading to a coupled elastoviscous problem that is poorly understood. Here we investigate a biomimetic model system of elastomer hair beds subject to shear-driven Stokes flows. We characterize this system with a theoretical model that accounts for the large-deformation flow response of hair beds. Hair bending results in a drag-reducing nonlinearity because the hair tip lowers towards the base. widening the gap through which fluid flows.

This active mechanical behavior is largely mediated by the actin cytoskeleton. a crosslinked network of actin filaments that is contracted by myosin motors. Experiments and active gel theories have established that the length scale over which gel contraction occurs is governed by a balance between molecular motor activity and crosslink density.

The management and control of that motion is paramount for the fitness of every organism. Many of the flows inside living organisms happen at low Reynolds numbers. and as such they are spared from the capriciousness of turbulence at high Re and other non-linearities at intermediate Re. However. that does not mean that the behavior of these low Reynolds number flows is always ordinary. The papers by Alvarado et al. and Louf et al. presented in this commentary explore two instances of the rich phenomenology of these flows. Both works use biology as inspiration to discuss how fluid flows interact with the soft materials that surround them. and how these interactions give rise to non-trivial and non-monotonic changes of drag and resistance.In the paper by Alvarado et al.. the authors consider dense mats of deformable hairs subject to low-Reynolds number flows (see Fig. 1A). For their experimental setup. they use a Taylor-Couette geometry composed of two concentric cylinders rotating with respect to each other. The fluid is confined between a “hairy” surface with bendable elastomer protrusions and a smooth surface. Although the constitutive relations that govern the system are linear. the authors find that a nonlinearity in the drag reduction emerges. The vertically anchored hairs. when subject to a fluid flow. respond by bending in the direction of the flow. as shown in Fig. 1B.

Dordrecht,Initiation of DNA synthesis in eukaryotic replication depends on the Pol α-primase complex. a multi-protein complex endowed with polymerase and primase activity. The Pol α-primase complex assembles the RNA-DNA primers required by the processive Pol δ and Pol ε for bulk DNA synthesis on the lagging and leading strand. respectively. During primer synthesis. the primase subunits synthesise de novo an oligomer of 7–12 ribonucleotides in length. which undergoes limited extension with deoxyribonucleotides by Pol α.

In the complex. Pol α and primase cooperate in the production of RNA-DNA oligonucleotides that prime synthesis of new DNA. Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic core of yeast Pol α in unliganded form. bound to an RNA primer/DNA template and extending an RNA primer with deoxynucleotides. We combine the structural analysis with biochemical and computational data to demonstrate that Pol α specifically recognizes the A-form RNA/DNA helix and that the ensuing synthesis of B-form DNA terminates primer synthesis. The spontaneous release of the completed RNA-DNA primer by the Pol α/primase complex simplifies current models of primer transfer to leading- and lagging strand polymerases. The proposed mechanism of nucleotide polymerization by Pol α might contribute to genomic stability by limiting the amount of inaccurate DNA to be corrected at the start of each Okazaki fragment.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00482.001,True,TKiX2i8AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,72,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00482,8038395262697188437,/scholar?cites=8038395262697188437,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00482.pdf,0,0,0

Here we show by biophysical and X-ray crystallographic analyses that the N-terminal domain of human CtIP exists as a stable homotetramer. Tetramerization results from interlocking interactions between the N-terminal extensions of CtIP's coiled-coil region. which lead to a'dimer-of-dimers' architecture. Through interrogation of the CtIP structure. we identify a point mutation that abolishes tetramerization of the N-terminal domain while preserving dimerization in vitro.

The theory of elasticity is essential to the recent developments of applied and fundamental science. such as the bio-mechanics of DNA filaments and other macro-molecules. and the animation of virtual characters in computer graphics and materials science. In this book. the emphasis is on the elasticity of thin bodies (plates. shells. rods) in connection with geometry. It covers such topics as the mechanics of hairs (curled and straight). the buckling instabilities of stressed plates. including folds and conical points appearing at larger stresses. the geometric rigidity of elastic shells. and the delamination of thin compressed films. It applies general methods of classical analysis. including advanced nonlinear aspects (bifurcation theory. boundary layer analysis). to derive detailed. fully explicit solutions to specific problems. These theoretical concepts are discussed in connection with experiments. The book is self-contained. Mathematical prerequisites are vector analysis and differential equations.

1102271,Discrete viscous sheets,2012,Christopher Batty and Andres Uribe and Basile Audoly and Eitan Grinspun,31,ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),4,1-7,ACM,We present the first reduced-dimensional technique to simulate the dynamics of thin sheets of viscous incompressible liquid in three dimensions. Beginning from a discrete Lagrangian model for elastic thin shells. we apply the Stokes-Rayleigh analogy to derive a simple yet consistent model for viscous forces. We incorporate nonlinear surface tension forces with a formulation based on minimizing discrete surface area. and preserve the quality of triangular mesh elements through local remeshing operations. Simultaneously. we track and evolve the thickness of each triangle to exactly conserve liquid volume. This approach enables the simulation of extremely thin sheets of viscous liquids. which are difficult to animate with existing volumetric approaches.

Previously established ribbon models are extended to handle geodesic curvature. natural out-of-plane curvature. and a variable width. Both the case of a finite width (Wunderlich’s model) and the limit of small width (Sadowksky’s model) are recovered. The ribbon is assumed to remain developable as it deforms. and the direction of the generatrices is used as an internal variable. Internal constraints expressing inextensibility are identified. The equilibrium of the ribbon is found to be governed by an equation of equilibrium for the internal variable involving its second-gradient. by the classical Kirchhoff equations for thin rods. and by specific. thin-rod-like constitutive laws; this extends the results of Starostin and van der Heijden (Nat.

Considerable compaction of the DNA molecule is required in order to reduce its volume below that of the cell.

However. a critical look at the available data reveals that this is not true for each of the proposed roles of this protein. The role of HU as a regulatory or accessory protein in a number of systems has been thoroughly investigated and in many cases has been largely elucidated.

Here we present an extensive literature survey of the available data which. in combination with novel microscopic insights. suggests that the role of HU could be the opposite as well.

The pivotal event during prion formation is the conversion of the normal prion protein (PrPC) into the pathogenic conformer PrPSc. which subsequently induces further conversion in an autocatalytic manner. Apparently. an expanded octarepeat domain directs folding of PrP toward the PrPSc conformation and initiates a self-replicating conversion process. Here. based on three main observations. we have provided a model on how altered molecular interactions between wild-type and mutant PrP set the stage for familial Creutzfeldt Jakob disease with octarepeat insertions. First. we showed that wild-type octarepeat domains interact in a copper-dependent and reversible manner. a “copper switch.” This interaction becomes irreversible …,True,wVn-wrkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,40,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820817141,12684306888243424035,/scholar?cites=12684306888243424035,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820817141,0,0,0

These proteins play an important role in functionally organizing the genomic DNA into a compact nucleoid. Cren7 and Sul7 are two crenarchaeal nucleoid-associated proteins. which are structurally homologous. but not conserved at the sequence level. Co-crystal structures have shown that these two proteins induce a sharp bend on binding to DNA. In this study. we have investigated the architectural properties of these proteins using atomic force microscopy. molecular dynamics simulations and magnetic tweezers.

The limiting process is a (randomly shifted) Poisson cluster process. where the positions of the clusters is a Poisson process with intensity measure with exponential density. The law of the individual clusters is characterized as branching Brownian motions conditioned to perform “unusually large displacements”. and its existence is proved. The proof combines three main ingredients.

By virtue of the groundbreaking work by M. Bramson on the convergence of solutions of the Fisher‐KPP equation to traveling waves. the law of the rightmost particle in the limit of large times is rather well understood. In this work. we address the full statistics of the extremal particles (first‐. second‐. third‐largest. etc.). In particular. we prove that in the large t‐limit. such particles descend with overwhelming probability from ancestors having split either within a distance of order 1 from time 0. or within a distance of order 1 from time t.

1102335,Is the Riemann zeta function in a short interval a 1-RSB spin glass?,2019,Louis-Pierre Arguin and Warren Tai,,,,63-88,Springer. Singapore,Fyodorov. Hiary & Keating established an intriguing connection between the maxima of log-correlated processes and the ones of the Riemann zeta function on a short interval of the critical line. In particular. they suggest that the analogue of the free energy of the Riemann zeta function is identical to the one of the Random Energy Model in spin glasses. In this paper. the connection between spin glasses and the Riemann zeta function is explored further. We study a random model of the Riemann zeta function and show that its two-overlap distribution corresponds to the one of a one-step replica symmetry breaking (1-RSB) spin glass. This provides evidence that the local maxima of the zeta function are strongly clustered. ,True,lX1qrtMAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,11,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-0294-1_3,16194364248901130421,/scholar?cites=16194364248901130421,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.08462,0,0,0
1102336,Extremes of the two-dimensional Gaussian free field with scale-dependent variance,2015,Louis-Pierre Arguin and Frédéric Ouimet,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.06253,,,,In this paper. we study a random field constructed from the two-dimensional Gaussian free field (GFF) by modifying the variance along the scales in the neighborhood of each point. The construction can be seen as a local martingale transform and is akin to the time-inhomogeneous branching random walk. In the case where the variance takes finitely many values. we compute the first order of the maximum and the log-number of high points. These quantities were obtained by Bolthausen. Deuschel and Giacomin (2001) and Daviaud (2006) when the variance is constant on all scales. The proof relies on a truncated second moment method proposed by Kistler (2015). which streamlines the proof of the previous results. We also discuss possible extensions of the construction to the continuous GFF.Comments: 30 pages. 4 figures. The argument in Lemma 3.1 and 3.4 was revised. Lemma A. 4.

ROSt’s are ℕ×ℕ random matrices whose entries are the overlaps of spin configurations sampled from the Gibbs measure. Since the ROSt construction is the same for mean-field models (like the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model) as for short-range ones (like the EA model). the setup is a good common ground to study the effect of dimensionality on the properties of the Gibbs measure. In this spirit. it is shown. using translation invariance. that the ROSt of the EA model possesses a local stability that is stronger than stochastic stability. a property known to hold at almost all temperatures in many spin glass models with Gaussian couplings.

1102340,A remark on the infinite-volume Gibbs measures of spin glasses,2008,Louis-Pierre Arguin,49,Journal of mathematical physics,12,125204,American Institute of Physics,In this note. we point out that infinite-volume Gibbs measures of spin glass models on the hypercube can be identified as random probability measures on the unit ball of a Hilbert space. This simple observation follows from a result of Dovbysh and Sudakov on weakly exchangeable random matrices. Limiting Gibbs measures can then be studied as single well-defined objects. This approach naturally extends the space of random overlap structures as defined by Aizenman et al. We discuss the Ruelle probability cascades and the stochastic stability within this framework. As an application. we use an idea of Parisi and Talagrand to prove that if a sequence of finite-volume Gibbs measures satisfies the Ghirlanda–Guerra identities. then the infinite-volume measure must be singular as a measure on a Hilbert space.,True,lX1qrtMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,8,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2966281,17817476813273336900,/scholar?cites=17817476813273336900,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.0683,0,0,0

It contained a good deal of data that are still relevant. But far more important. the book established a number of precedents in uses of paleopathology to address archaeological issues and interpreta-tions of prehistory. The conference resulted from the confluence of two areas of research that previously had had little interaction. The first was the statement of a new interpretation of prehistory and particularly the emergence of sedentary agriculture as demand driven. rather than propelled by a new “invention.” and involving reluctant adoption of novel but inferior economic patterns (Cohen 1977).

Some researchers have argued that the syphilis-causing bacterium. or its progenitor. was brought from the New World to Europe by Christopher Columbus and his men. while others maintain that the treponematoses. including syphilis. have a much longer history on the European continent.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe applied phylogenetics to this problem. using data from 21 genetic regions examined in 26 geographically disparate strains of pathogenic Treponema. Of all the strains examined. the venereal syphilis-causing strains originated most recently and were more closely related to yaws-causing strains from South America than to other non-venereal strains. Old World yaws-causing strains occupied a basal position on the tree. indicating that they arose first in human history. and a simian strain of T. pallidum was found to be indistinguishable from them.Conclusions/SignificanceOur results lend support to the Columbian theory of syphilis's origin while suggesting that the non-sexually transmitted subspecies arose earlier in the Old World. This study represents the first attempt to address the problem of the origin of syphilis using molecular genetics. as well as the first source of information regarding the genetic make-up of non-venereal strains from the Western hemisphere.,True,96eMLFoAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,244,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000148,12389195058220283008,/scholar?cites=12389195058220283008,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000148,0,0,0

It was not until epidemiological techniques were applied to the study of ancient disease that paleopathology regained prominence (3).An obvious objective of paleopathology is to add to existing knowledge of the geographical and chronological distribution of diseases and injuries in ancient populations. In addition. an analysis of the disease patterns of ancient populations can sometimes provide an index of biological response to stress. hence information on cultural factors.

Here. we propose an additional ethical justification for bioarchaeology based on relational ethics. theoretical work on embodiment. and the produced and constituted nature of human bodies. and on deriving meaning from skeletal remains: highly contextualized skeletal data analyzed in a relational. contingent interpretive space can generate otherwise inaccessible. direct information about the constitutive. productive effects of processes like power and oppression on human bodies. This enables recovery and recognition of the agency. singularity. and meaning of past peoples through giving voice to their narratives. This justification is not universally applicable; it is best suited to skeletal remains from marginalized. disenfranchised. and impoverished individuals and communities. We conclude with a case study applying the approach to a skeletal sample from the 18th-19th century Mississippi State Asylum to demonstrate that the approach complements more traditional bioarchaeological research while providing an additional foundation for ethical discourses and debates in the field.Anthropology has a rich history of ethical debates and discourses and professional ethical codes.

1102378,New directions in biocultural anthropology,2016,Molly K Zuckerman and Debra L Martin,,,,,John Wiley & Sons,Biocultural or biosocial anthropology is a research approach that views biology and culture as dialectically and inextricably intertwined. explicitly emphasizing the dynamic interaction between humans and their larger social. cultural. and physical environments. The biocultural approach emerged in anthropology in the 1960s. matured in the 1980s. and is now one of the dominant paradigms in anthropology. particularly within biological anthropology. This volume gathers contributions from the top scholars in biocultural anthropology focusing on six of the most influential. productive. and important areas of research within biocultural anthropology. These are: critical and synthetic approaches within biocultural anthropology; biocultural approaches to identity. including race and racism; health. diet. and nutrition; infectious disease from antiquity to the modern era; epidemiologic transitions and population dynamics; and inequality and violence studies. Focusing on these six major areas of burgeoning research within biocultural anthropology makes the proposed volume timely. widely applicable and useful to scholars engaging in biocultural research and students interested in the biocultural approach. and synthetic in its coverage of contemporary scholarship in biocultural anthropology. Students will be able to grasp the history of the biocultural approach. and how that history continues to impact scholarship. as well as the scope of current research within the approach. and the foci of biocultural research into the future.

Each chapter addresses a critical topic that is under investigation using the biocultural approach. Since the mid‐twentieth century. the biocultural approach has acted as a cohering and integrative intellectual approach within anthropology. particularly within the subdisciplines of biological. medical. and sociocultural anthropology. Between the 1960s and the 1980s. the biocultural approach matured under the influences of ecological anthropology and political economy. The linking of demographic. biological. and cultural processes within an ecological framework that is found in the biocultural approach is essential for dealing with the kinds of questions that interest anthropologists across the discipline.

In contrast to the distribution of arsenic in the 8–30 m depth range which does not follow any obvious geological feature. the arsenic content of groundwater associated with relatively oxic Pleistocene sand deposits appears to be consistently low.

The sedimentary record of PAHs in Richardson Bay shows that anthropogenic inputs have increased since the turn of the century. presumably as a result of increasing urbanization and industrialization around the Bay Area. Concentrations range from about 0.04–6.3 μg g−1. The dominant origin of the PAHs contributing to this modern contamination is from combustion processes. Depth profiles in San Pablo Bay indicate higher concentrations of PAHs since the 1950s than during the late 1800s. also presumably resulting from an increase in urbanization and industrialization.

A concordance probability evaluating the classification accuracy of a dichotomized measure is defined as an objective function of the possible cut point. A nonparametric approach is used to search for the optimal cut point maximizing the objective function. The procedure is shown to perform well in a simulation study.

Variability in susceptibility to arsenic toxicity may be related to nutritional status. Arsenic is methylated to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) via one-carbon metabolism. a biochemical pathway that is dependent on folate. The majority of one-carbon metabolism methylation reactions are devoted to biosynthesis of creatine. the precursor of creatinine. Our objectives of this cross-sectional study were to characterize the relationships among folate. cobalamin. homocysteine. and arsenic metabolism in Bangladeshi adults.

Increasing δ15N since ~1990 records an expansion of anoxia. consistent with observed O2 trends. However. this was preceded by a longer declining δ15N trend that implies that the anoxic zone was shrinking for most of the 20th century.

Many households therefore draw their water for drinking and cooking from untested wells. A household drinking water survey of 6646 households was conducted in Singair upazilla of Bangladesh. A subset of 795 untested wells used by 1000 randomly selected households was tested in the field by trained village workers with the Hach EZ kit. using an extended reaction time of 40 min. and in the laboratory by high-resolution inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HR ICP-MS). The household survey shows that more than 80% of the wells installed since the national testing campaign in this area were untested. Less than 13% of the households with untested wells knew where a low-As well was located near their home. Village workers using the Hach EZ kit underestimated the As content of only 4 out of 795 wells relative to the Bangladesh standard. However. the As content of 168 wells was overestimated relative to the same threshold. There is a growing need for testing tubewells in areas of Bangladesh where As concentrations in groundwater are elevated.

1102496,Mechanisms of Arsenic Toxicity in Humans: Interplay of Arsenic. Glutathione. and DNA Methylation in Bangladeshi Adults,2014,Megan Marie Niedzwiecki,,,,,,Background: Over 200 million individuals worldwide are chronically exposed to arsenic (As) in drinking water at concentrations above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 10 µg/L. Arsenic exposure is of particular concern in Bangladesh. where it is estimated that 35-77 million people are exposed to As in well water at concentrations above the WHO guideline. Chronic As exposure is associated with neurological impairments. respiratory disease. cardiovascular disease. skin lesions. and cancers of the skin. liver. lung and bladder. The mechanisms of As toxicity in humans are not well-characterized: there are considerable interspecies differences in As toxicokinetics. and until recently. there were no animal models to study As carcinogenesis. However. two of several proposed pathways of As toxicity in humans involve DNA methylation and oxidative stress. Arsenic metabolism. DNA methylation. and glutathione (GSH) are metabolically connected through the one-carbon metabolism and transsulfuration pathways. and their interactions are remarkably complex. The epidemiologic studies in this dissertation are designed to address the overarching hypothesis that one-carbon metabolism and the transsulfuration pathway interact to influence susceptibility to As toxicity.Introduction: Arsenic is methylated in the liver to monomethyl (MMA) and dimethyl (DMA) arsenical species by arsenic (III)-methyltransferase (AS3MT). which requires a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and the presence of a reductant. such as glutathione (GSH).

Recently. a form of T. pallidum infection associated with severe genital lesions has been described in wild baboons at Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania. In this study. we investigated ten additional sites in Tanzania and Kenya using a combination of macroscopic observation and serology. in order to determine whether the infection was present in each area. In addition. we obtained genetic sequence data from six polymorphic regions using T. pallidum strains collected from baboons at two different Tanzanian sites. We report that lesions consistent with T. pallidum infection were present at four of the five Tanzanian sites examined. and serology was used to confirm treponemal infection at three of these. By contrast. no signs of treponemal infection were observed at the six Kenyan sites. and serology indicated T. pallidum was present at only one of them. A survey of sexually mature baboons at Lake Manyara National Park in 2006 carried out as part of this study indicated that roughly ten percent displayed T. pallidum-associated lesions severe enough to cause major structural damage to the genitalia. Finally. we found that T. pallidum strains from Lake Manyara National Park and Serengeti National Park were genetically distinct. and a phylogeny suggested that baboon strains may have diverged prior to the clade containing human strains.

Another area. in which BD is endemic. was found in the 1970s in the eastern part of Switzerland (Metzler and others 1976). This short communication is belived to be the first report that clinical BD is also endemic. at least in horses. in an area of Austria. located in the most western federal state. Vorarlberg. Naturally occurring BD has also been found in other animal species. such as rabbits and cattle (Metzler and others 1978. Bode and others 1994. Caplazi and others 1994). In addition to the classical nD-endemic areas. subclinical or atypical infections with Borna disease virus (BDV) seem to occur worldwide. including the USA and Japan. as determined recently by the detection of specific antibodies and/or nucleic acid (Kao and others 1993. Nakamura and others 1995). There is also some evidence that BDV or related agents cause neurological disease in cats and ostriches (Lundgren and others 1995. Malkinson and others 1995.

There has been enormous interest in BDV infection since BDV-specific antibodies.-RNA andantigen were detected in humans with certain mental disorders (Rott and others 1985.

Fifty-five had transmissible venereal tumours. and the remaining 31 animals were used as controls. A thorough clinical examination of the external genitalia was carried out in each case. In the dogs with transmissible venereal tumours. the sites of attachment were recorded.

Infection was further confirmed from tissue samples of skin-ulcerated animals by 3 independent PCRs (polA. tp47. and TP_0619). Our findings indicate that T. pallidum infection is geographically widespread in Tanzania and occurs in several species (olive baboons. yellow baboons. vervet monkeys. and blue monkeys). We found the bacterium at 11 of 14 investigated geographic locations. Anogenital ulceration was the most common clinical manifestation; orofacial lesions also were observed.

Especially in light of the fact that the World Health Organizaiton (WHO) recently launched its second yaws eradication campaign. there is a considerable need for reliable tools to identify treponemal infection in our closest relatives. African monkeys and great apes. It was hypothesized that commercially available serological tests detect simian anti-T. pallidum antibody in serum samples of baboons. with comparable sensitivity and specificity to their results on human sera. Test performances of five different treponemal tests (TTs) and two non-treponemal tests (NTTs) were evaluated using serum samples of 57 naturally T. pallidum-infected olive baboons (Papio anubis) from Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania. The T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) was used as a gold standard for comparison. In addition. the overall infection status of the animals was used to further validate test performances. For most accurate results. only samples that originated from baboons of known infection status. as verified in a previous study by clinical inspection. PCR and immunohistochemistry. were included. All tests. TTs and NTTs. used in this study were able to reliably detect antibodies against T. pallidum in serum samples of infected baboons. The sensitivity of TTs ranged from 97.7-100%. while specificity was between 88.0-100.0%.

The disease was subject to global eradication efforts in the mid 20th century but reemerged in West Africa. Southern Asia. and the Pacific region. Despite its importance for eradication. detailed data on possible nonhuman disease reservoirs are missing. A number of African nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been reported to show skin ulcerations suggestive of treponemal infection in humans. Furthermore antibodies against Treponema pallidum (TP) have been repeatedly detected in wild NHP populations. While genetic studies confirmed that NHPs are infected with TP strains. subspecies identification was only possible once for a strain isolated in 1966. pinpointing the involvement of TPE. We therefore collected a number of recently isolated simian TP strains and determined eight whole genome sequences using hybridization capture or long-range PCR combined with next-generation sequencing. These new genomes were compared with those of known human TP isolates. Our results show that naturally occurring simian TP strains circulating in three African NHP species all cluster with human TPE strains and show the same genomic structure as human TPE strains.

In order to identify the responsible pathogen. sixty-three baboons were temporarily chemically immobilised and sampled. In addition to the main course of the study (identification of the aetiology) and for a maximization of data collection several other aspects were included to the sampling protocol. Thus an exfoliative vaginal cytology (EVC) was performed in 30 females to investigate its application and reliability under field conditions. The appearance of perineal tumescence was compared with the cytological picture of vaginal smears stained with Papanicolaou and Hemacolor. In 23 (77%) of 30 sampled baboon females the cell composition of vaginal cytology matched the perineal swelling stage of the female’s genital skin. It is concluded that EVC is a useful and cost-effective tool for the evaluation of sexual cycle stages in the Olive baboons.

Here. we have used Helicobacter hepaticus infection of T cell–reconstituted recombination-activating gene (RAG)−/− mice as a model to study the ability of CD4+CD25+ TR cells to inhibit bacterially triggered intestinal inflammation. H. hepaticus infection elicited both T cell-mediated and T cell–independent intestinal inflammation. both of which were inhibited by adoptively transferred CD4+CD25+ TR cells.

Some researchers have argued that the syphilis-causing bacterium. or its progenitor. was brought from the New World to Europe by Christopher Columbus and his men. while others maintain that the treponematoses. including syphilis. have a much longer history on the European continent.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe applied phylogenetics to this problem. using data from 21 genetic regions examined in 26 geographically disparate strains of pathogenic Treponema. Of all the strains examined. the venereal syphilis-causing strains originated most recently and were more closely related to yaws-causing strains from South America than to other non-venereal strains. Old World yaws-causing strains occupied a basal position on the tree. indicating that they arose first in human history. and a simian strain of T. pallidum was found to be indistinguishable from them.Conclusions/SignificanceOur results lend support to the Columbian theory of syphilis's origin while suggesting that the non-sexually transmitted subspecies arose earlier in the Old World. This study represents the first attempt to address the problem of the origin of syphilis using molecular genetics. as well as the first source of information regarding the genetic make-up of non-venereal strains from the Western hemisphere.,True,HK4RVb0AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,244,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000148,12389195058220283008,/scholar?cites=12389195058220283008,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000148,0,0,0

Of the group IX ERFs. the IXc subgroup has been studied the most. and includes ERF1. ERF14 and ORA59. which play roles in plant innate immunity. Here we investigate the biological functions of two members of the less studied IXb subgroup: ERF5 and ERF6. In order to identify potential targets of these transcription factors. microarray analyses were performed on plants constitutively expressing either ERF5 or ERF6. Expression of defense genes. JA/Et-responsive genes and genes containing the GCC box promoter motif were significantly upregulated in both ERF5 and ERF6 transgenic plants. suggesting that ERF5 and ERF6 may act as positive regulators of JA-mediated defense and potentially overlap in their function. Since defense against necrotrophic pathogens is generally mediated through JA/Et-signalling. resistance against the fungal necrotroph Botrytis cinerea was examined. Constitutive expression of ERF5 or ERF6 resulted in significantly increased resistance. Although no significant difference in susceptibility to B. cinerea was observed in either erf5 or erf6 mutants. the erf5 erf6 double mutant showed a significant increase in susceptibility. which was likely due to compromised JA-mediated gene expression. since JA-induced gene expression was reduced in the double mutant.

We therefore used microarray analysis to elucidate the complete miRNome (miRBase version 13.0) of purified tumor (CD138+) cells from 33 patients with MM. 5 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and 9 controls. Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed that MM and MGUS samples have a distinct microRNA expression profile from control CD138+ cells. The majority of microRNAs aberrantly expressed in MM (109/129) were up-regulated. A comparison of these microRNAs with those aberrantly expressed in other B-cell and T-cell malignancies revealed a surprising degree of similarity (~40%) suggesting the existence of a common lymphoma microRNA signature. We identified 39 microRNAs associated with the pre-malignant condition MGUS. Twenty-three (59%) of these were also aberrantly expressed in MM suggesting common microRNA expression events in MM progression. MM is characterized by multiple chromosomal abnormalities of varying prognostic significance. We identified specific microRNA signatures associated with the most common IgH translocations (t(4;14) and t(11;14)) and del(13q).

1102550,RNA-seq: impact of RNA degradation on transcript quantification,2014,Irene Gallego Romero and Athma A Pai and Jenny Tung and Yoav Gilad,12,BMC biology,1,1-13,BioMed Central,The use of low quality RNA samples in whole-genome gene expression profiling remains controversial. It is unclear if transcript degradation in low quality RNA samples occurs uniformly. in which case the effects of degradation can be corrected via data normalization. or whether different transcripts are degraded at different rates. potentially biasing measurements of expression levels. This concern has rendered the use of low quality RNA samples in whole-genome expression profiling problematic. Yet. low quality samples (for example. samples collected in the course of fieldwork) are at times the sole means of addressing specific questions. We sought to quantify the impact of variation in RNA quality on estimates of gene expression levels based on RNA-seq data. To do so. we collected expression data from tissue samples that were allowed to decay for varying amounts of time prior to RNA extraction. The RNA samples we collected spanned the entire range of RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values (a metric commonly used to assess RNA quality). We observed widespread effects of RNA quality on measurements of gene expression levels. as well as a slight but significant loss of library complexity in more degraded samples. While standard normalizations failed to account for the effects of degradation. we found that by explicitly controlling for the effects of RIN using a linear model framework we can correct for the majority of these effects. We conclude that in instances in which RIN and the effect of interest are not associated. this approach can help recover biologically meaningful signals in data from degraded RNA samples.,True,EkxYj78AAAAJ:w9ZB08sdvuUC,282,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-12-42,5998996894971996640,/scholar?cites=5998996894971996640,,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-12-42,0,0,0

Investigating the reciprocal relationships between host behavior and the microbiome thus promises to shed new light on both the evolution of host social behavior and microbial transmission strategies.,True,EkxYj78AAAAJ:gI9wzKcniAoC,93,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615001060,4334973187217266384,/scholar?cites=4334973187217266384,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615001060,0,0,0

1102563,A flexible. efficient binomial mixed model for identifying differential DNA methylation in bisulfite sequencing data,2015,Amanda J Lea and Jenny Tung and Xiang Zhou,11,PLoS genetics,11,e1005650,Public Library of Science,Identifying sources of variation in DNA methylation levels is important for understanding gene regulation. Recently. bisulfite sequencing has become a popular tool for investigating DNA methylation levels. However. modeling bisulfite sequencing data is complicated by dramatic variation in coverage across sites and individual samples. and because of the computational challenges of controlling for genetic covariance in count data. To address these challenges. we present a binomial mixed model and an efficient. sampling-based algorithm (MACAU: Mixed model association for count data via data augmentation) for approximate parameter estimation and p-value computation. This framework allows us to simultaneously account for both the over-dispersed. count-based nature of bisulfite sequencing data. as well as genetic relatedness among individuals. Using simulations and two real data sets (whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data from Arabidopsis thaliana and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data from baboons). we show that our method provides well-calibrated test statistics in the presence of population structure. Further. it improves power to detect differentially methylated sites: in the RRBS data set. MACAU detected 1.6-fold more age-associated CpG sites than a beta-binomial model (the next best approach). Changes in these sites are consistent with known age-related shifts in DNA methylation levels. and are enriched near genes that are differentially expressed with age in the same population.

Recently. a form of T. pallidum infection associated with severe genital lesions has been described in wild baboons at Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania. In this study. we investigated ten additional sites in Tanzania and Kenya using a combination of macroscopic observation and serology. in order to determine whether the infection was present in each area. In addition. we obtained genetic sequence data from six polymorphic regions using T. pallidum strains collected from baboons at two different Tanzanian sites.

Further. pioneer TFs linked to higher activity in the methylated state appear to drive demethylation of experimentally methylated sites.

Among female baboons. those who are most socially integrated reproduce most successfully. Here we test a number of predictions derived from kin selection theory about the strength of social bonds among adult female baboons. Our analyses are based on systematic observations of grooming and association patterns among 118 females living in seven different social groups in the Amboseli Basin of Kenya over a 16-year period. Females in these groups formed the strongest bonds with close kin. including their mothers. daughters. and maternal and paternal sisters. Females were also strongly attracted toward females who were close to their own age. perhaps because peers were often paternal sisters.

Using longitudinal data from the National Survey of Children (NSC). the authors discuss how much of the relationship between a separation and measures of adult well-being (including educational and economic attainment. patterns of family formation. delinquency. and psychological well-being) is due to selectivity of parents into more fragile marriages and to family conflict that often precedes the physical departure of a parent from the household.

American Association for Public Opinion Research,BackgroundResearchers generally agree that nonresponse can bias survey data because nonrespondents may differ systematically from respondents (Groves and Cou-per 1998). However. the magnitude of the problem usually cannot be deter-mined for specific surveys. and techniques to adjust for these biases are limited (Smith 1983). The difficulties stem from the fact that we rarely observe the characteristics of nonrespondents. In one of the few studies with data on nonrespondents. Lin and Schaeffer (1995) tested two common methods of adjusting for nonresponse error:(1) using high-effort cases as proxies for nonrespondents and (2) weighting the data on the basis of known characteristics of nonrespondents. They found neither fix to be successful. Not only do high-effort cases generally fail to eliminate nonresponse error. but they may yield diminishing returns as response rates increase. Both Curtin.

1102610,The consequences of father absence,1999,Sara McLanahan and Julien Teitler,8,Parenting and child development in “nontraditional” families,,83-102,,Increases in divorce and nonmarital childbearing have dramatically altered the family lives of children in the United States. Whereas in the early 1960s. nearly 90% of all children lived with both of their biological parents until age 18; today less than half of children grow up with both parents. Nearly one third are born to unmarried parents. the vast majority of whom never live together. and another one third are born to married parents who divorce before the child reaches adulthood. Many children who live apart from their biological fathers spend time in a stepparent family. and a substantial proportion of these children experience multiple disruptions.These changes in children’s family arrangements have created considerable concern among policy makers and have stimulated heated debate about the causes and consequences of father absence. Some analysts argue that growing up with a single mother is the primary cause of many of the United States’ most serious social problems. including poverty. high school dropout. teen pregnancy. and delinquency (Blankenhorn. 1995; Popenoe. 1988; Whitehead 1993). Others argue that poverty and economic insecurity are the real culprits. Still others claim that the problems associated with family disruption are rooted in marital discord that begins long before the parents separate or divorce (Skolnick. 1991; Stacy. 1993). In this chapter. we seek to shed some light on this debate by reviewing the findings of several major studies of the effects of father absence on adolescent behavior and transitions to young adulthood.

The proportions are even higher among poor and minority populations--at 40 percent among Hispanics and 70 percent among African Americans. Non-marital childbearing also is increasing throughout the western European countries. Indeed. the rate of non-marital births is higher in the Scandinavian countries (and France) than it is in the United States (Ventura et. al. 1995). The US is different from these other countries in one important respect. however. Whereas in Europe the overwhelming majority of unwed parents are living together when their child is born. in the US less than half of new unwed parents are cohabiting. Thus. children born outside marriage in the US are much more likely to be poor and much more likely to experience father absence than children born outside marriage in other countries. Both poverty and father absence have been shown to negatively affect children’s future life chances (McLanahan and Sandefur 1994. Duncan and Brooks-Gunn 1997).In response to growing concern over the economic and social costs of nonmarital childbearing. policy makers have begun to pass laws that make it more difficult for unmarried fathers to abandon their children and for unmarried mothers to raise their children alone. In the 1980s. Congress passed a series of laws designed to increase paternity establishment and strengthen child support enforcement.

Abstinence-only programs have been found not to help youth delay initiation of sexual intercourse; long-term demographic trends such as later ages at first marriage suggest that policies and programs promoting abstinence until marriage are unlikely to work. Emphasis on abstinence-only programs has coincided with restrictions on what teachers can cover in health education classes and with fewer students reporting that they received information about such topics as contraception and sexually transmitted disease prevention.

Past approaches to the measurement of father involvement have been characterized by at least five limitations:(1) Mothers are often used as proxy for fathers.(2) the often interchangeable use of generic fathering versus child-specific fathering.(3) the limited generalization of findings from middle-class. European American groups to other cultural groups.(4) the validity of fathers’ self-report data. and (5) the narrow or dichotomous (present/absent) definition of father involvement.

Recent studies developed walkability models combining several built environment characteristics to optimally predict walking. Developing and testing such models with the same data could lead to overestimating one's ability to predict walking in an independent sample of the population. More accurate estimates of model fit can be obtained by splitting a single study population into training and validation sets (holdout approach) or through developing and evaluating models in different populations. We used these two approaches to test whether built environment characteristics near the home predict walking for exercise. Study participants lived in western Washington State and were adult members of a health maintenance organization.

Previous studies have shown that knockout of 5-HT1A selectively in the raphe leads to higher levels of anxiety during adulthood. However. it remains unclear whether this phenotype is due to variation in receptor levels specifically during development or throughout life. To test the hypothesis that developmental sensitivity may underlie the effects of 5-HT1A on anxiety. we used an inducible transgenic system to selectively suppress 5-HT1A levels in serotonergic raphe neurons from post-natal days (P) 14 to P30. with a maximal reduction of 40% at P21 and return to regular levels by P30. This developmental decrease in receptor levels has long-lasting consequences. increasing anxiety and decreasing social investigation in adulthood.

One such gene is the vasopressin receptor 1a gene (Avpr1a). which exhibits striking differences in neural expression patterns that are responsible for mediating differences in vasopressin-mediated social behaviors. The genomic mechanisms that contribute to these remarkable differences in expression are not well understood. Previous work has suggested that both the proximal 5′ flanking region and a polymorphic microsatellite element within that region of the vole Avpr1a gene are associated with variation in V1a receptor (V1aR) distribution and behavior. but neither has been causally linked. Using homologous recombination in mice. we reveal the modest contribution of proximal 5′ flanking sequences to species differences in V1aR distribution. and confirm that variation in V1aR distribution impacts stress-coping in the forced swim test. We also demonstrate that the vole Avpr1a microsatellite structure contributes to Avpr1a expression in the amygdala. thalamus. and hippocampus. mirroring a subset of the inter- and intra-species differences observed in central V1aR patterns in voles. This is the first direct evidence that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes can contribute to diversity in brain gene expression profiles. providing a mechanism for generating behavioral diversity both at the individual and species level.

Comparisons between monogamous prairie voles and the closely related but nonmonogamous meadow and montane voles have revealed that brain-region-specific neuropeptide receptor patterning modulates social behavior between and within species. In particular. diversity in vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) distribution has been linked to individual and species differences in monogamy-related behaviors such as partner preference. mate guarding. and space use. Given the importance of differential receptor expression for regulating social behavior. a critical question has …,True,ahMS-MUAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,10,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acschemneuro.7b00475,3837098339287996752,/scholar?cites=3837098339287996752,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6093782/,0,0,0

It represents a way in which social interactions can immediately and potently modulate behavior. As such. social buffering is one mechanism by which strong social support increases resilience to mental illness. Although the behavioral and neuroendocrine impacts of social buffering are well studied in multiple species. including humans. the neuronal underpinnings of this behavioral phenomenon remain largely unexplored. Previous work has shown that the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL-PFC) is important for processing social information and. in separate studies. for modulating fear and anxiety. Thus. we hypothesized that socially active cells within the IL-PFC may integrate social information to modulate fear responsivity. To test this hypothesis. we employed social …,True,ahMS-MUAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,7,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-0631-1,10494495855969912725,/scholar?cites=10494495855969912725,,http://www.zdonaldsonlab.com/s/NPP-2020.pdf,0,0,0

Precise images and measures of network structure are derived from reports of relationships that occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995. The study offers a comparison of the structural characteristics of the observed network to simulated networks conditioned on the distribution of ties; the observed structure reveals networks characterized by longer contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with structural features similar to the observed network.

We analyzed friendship data on 13 465 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health to explore the relationship between friendship and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. We controlled for known factors associated with suicidality.Results. Having had a friend who committed suicide increased the likelihood of suicidal ideation and attempts for both boys and girls.

This paper explores                     the effect of those pledges on the transition to first intercourse. Adolescents                     who pledge are much less likely to have intercourse than                     adolescents who do not pledge. The delay effect is substantial.

The first paradox is the simultaneous absence and presence of attitude polarization—the fact that global attitude polarization is relatively rare. even though pundits describe it as common. The second paradox is the simultaneous presence and absence of social polarization—the fact that while individuals experience attitude homogeneity in their interpersonal networks. their networks are characterized by attitude heterogeneity. These paradoxes give rise to numerous scholarly arguments. By developing a formal model of interpersonal influence over attitudes in a context where individuals hold simultaneous positions on multiple issues. we show why these arguments are not mutually exclusive and how they meaningfully refer to the same social setting.
