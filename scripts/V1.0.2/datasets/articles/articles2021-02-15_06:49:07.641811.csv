1025034,Tau protein modifications and interactions: their role in function and dysfunction,2014,Anna Mietelska-Porowska and Urszula Wasik and Marcelina Goras and Anna Filipek and Grazyna Niewiadomska,15,,3,4671-4713,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Tau protein is abundant in the central nervous system and involved in microtubule assembly and stabilization. It is predominantly associated with axonal microtubules and present at lower level in dendrites where it is engaged in signaling functions. Post-translational modifications of tau and its interaction with several proteins play an important regulatory role in the physiology of tau. As a consequence of abnormal modifications and expression. tau is redistributed from neuronal processes to the soma and forms toxic oligomers or aggregated deposits. The accumulation of tau protein is increasingly recognized as the neuropathological hallmark of a number of dementia disorders known as tauopathies. Dysfunction of tau protein may contribute to collapse of cytoskeleton. thereby causing improper anterograde and retrograde movement of motor proteins and their cargos on microtubules. These disturbances in intraneuronal signaling may compromise synaptic transmission as well as trophic support mechanisms in neurons.

S.. and Reed. J. C. (2001) Mol. Cell 7. 915–926). In murine brain. CacyBP/SIP is expressed at a high level. but S100A6 is expressed at a very low level. Consequently we carried out experiments to determine if CacyBP/SIP binds to other S100 proteins in this tissue. Using CacyBP/SIP affinity chromatography. we found that S100B from the brain extract binds to CacyBP/SIP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Using a nitrocellulose overlay assay with 125I-CacyBP/SIP and CacyBP/SIP affinity chromatography. we found that this protein binds purified S100A1. S100A6. S100A12.

1025036,S100A6–new facts and features,2009,Wiesława Leśniak and Łukasz P Słomnicki and Anna Filipek,390,,4,1087-1092,Academic Press,S100A6 (calcyclin) is a 10.5 kDa Ca2+-binding protein that belongs to the S100 protein family. S100A6 contains two EF-hand motifs responsible for binding of Ca2+. It also binds Zn2+ through not yet identified structures. Binding of Ca2+ induces a conformational change in the S100A6 molecule which in consequence increases its overall hydrophobicity and allows for interaction with target proteins. S100A6 was found in different mammalian and avian (chicken) tissues. A high level of S100A6 is observed in epithelial cells. fibroblasts and in different kinds of cancer cells. The function of S100A6 is not clear at present. but it has been suggested that it may be involved in cell proliferation. cytoskeletal dynamics and tumorigenesis. Additionally. S100A6 might have some extracellular activities.

1025100,Effects of dietary polyphenols on gene expression in human vascular endothelial cells,2008,Sonja K Nicholson and Gregory A Tucker and John M Brameld,67,,1,42-47,Cambridge University Press,Previous studies have shown that consumption of fruit and vegetables plays a role in preventing the onset of CVD. These beneficial effects have been linked to the presence of polyphenolic compounds in plant-derived foods and their antioxidant capacity. It has been hypothesised that polyphenols may also have a direct effect on vascular endothelial cell growth and the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and other roles of the endothelium. Previous studies in this area have tended to use concentrations of polyphenols that are supraphysiological (1–100 μm).

These values were related directly to growth rates (0.06 +/- 0.02 to 0.44 +/- 0.01 kg/day) and total hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels. Increased growth rates were accompanied by an increase in hepatic class 1 and class 2 IGF-I mRNA levels and an increase in the ratio of class 2 to class 1 IGF-I mRNA in liver. suggesting a distinct role for class 2 expression in the endocrine growth response. High levels of class 1 transcripts and a virtual absence of class 2 transcripts characterized all muscle tissues examined. and there was no correlation with plasma IGF-I levels.

VGF gene expression is photoperiodically regulated in the hypothalamus with significantly higher expression in lean Siberian hamsters. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of VGF in regulating these seasonal cycles by determining the effects of a VGF-derived peptide (TLQP-21) on food intake and body weight. Acute intracerebroventricular administration of TLQP-21 decreased food intake. and chronic treatment caused a sustained reduction in food intake and body weight and decreased abdominal fat depots.

Previous studies have revealed a profound up-regulation of type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) mRNA in the ventral ependyma of the hypothalamus associated with hypophagia and weight loss in short-day photoperiods. DIO3 reduces the local availability of T3. so the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that decreased hypothalamic T3 availability underlies the short-day-induced catabolic state. The experimental approach was to determine whether a local increase in T3 in the hypothalamus of hamsters exposed to short days could reverse the behavioral and physiological changes induced by this photoperiod.

Recently research has been focused on peptides from marine animal sources. since they have been found as secondary metabolites from sponges. ascidians. tunicates. and mollusks. The structural characteristics of these peptides include various unusual amino acid residues which may be responsible for their bioactivity. Moreover. protein hydrolysates formed by the enzymatic digestion of aquatic and marine by-products are an important source of bioactive peptides. Purified peptides from these sources have been shown to have antioxidant activity and cytotoxic effect on several human cancer cell lines such as HeLa. AGS. and DLD-1. These characteristics imply that the use of peptides from marine sources has potential for the prevention and treatment of cancer. and that they might also be useful as molecular models in anticancer drug research. This review focuses on the latest studies and critical research in this field. and evidences the immense potential of marine animals as bioactive peptide sources.

The term surfactant covers surface-active compounds which are characterized by their ability to concentrate at surfaces and to form micelles in solution. The prerequisite for this surface activity is the amphiphilic structure of the surfactant molecule. which consists of a polar (hydrophilic) part and a nonpolar (hydrophobic) part. In APEOs. the hydrophilic group is a polyethoxylate chain with varying ethoxylation degrees (number of ethoxylate (EO) units) 1-40).

Remediation of these synthetic compounds is difficult and an enormous logistical task. Phytoremediation is a technique that offers an environmentally friendly. low-cost alternative to current remediation techniques; however. this approach is hindered by the low inherent metabolic abilities of plants towards these xenobiotic compounds and the phytotoxicity of these compounds.

One underlying reason is the fact that detergents do not stabilize membrane domains as efficiently as natural lipids in membranes. often leading to a partial to complete loss of activity/stability during protein extraction and purification and preventing crystallization in an active conformation.   Methodology/Principal Findings Anionic calix[4]arene based detergents (C4Cn. n = 1–12) were designed to structure the membrane domains through hydrophobic interactions and a network of salt bridges with the basic residues found at the cytosol-membrane interface of membrane proteins. These compounds behave as surfactants. forming micelles of 5–24 nm. with the critical micellar concentration (CMC) being as expected sensitive to pH ranging from 0.05 to 1.5 mM. Both by 1H NMR titration and Surface Tension titration experiments. the interaction of these molecules with the basic amino acids was confirmed. They extract membrane proteins from different origins behaving as mild detergents. leading to partial extraction in some cases. They also retain protein functionality. as shown for BmrA (Bacillus multidrug resistance ATP protein). a membrane multidrug-transporting ATPase. which is particularly sensitive to detergent extraction. These new detergents allow BmrA to bind daunorubicin with a Kd of 12 µM. a value similar to that observed after purification using dodecyl maltoside (DDM).

A general procedure using ceramic hydroxyapatite (HAP) chromatography was developed for the complete removal of SDS bound to soluble or membrane proteins.

To investigate the structure of the tetramer. a nitroxide side chain (R1) was introduced at 18 different positions. The effects of R1 on oligomer formation. EPR spectra. and inter‐spin distance measurements all show that the structures of the solution and crystal tetramers are different. Inter‐subunit distance measurements revealed that only arrestin monomer binds to light‐activated phosphorhodopsin. whereas both monomer and tetramer bind microtubules. which may serve as a default arrestin partner in dark‐adapted photoreceptors. Thus. the tetramer likely serves as a ‘storage’ form of arrestin. increasing the arrestin‐binding capacity of microtubules while readily dissociating to supply active monomer when it is …,True,8MV-deIAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,108,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601614,17506761684105629849,/scholar?cites=17506761684105629849,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601614,0,0,0

H96. and H119) and a hydroxide ion with tetrahedral geometry. Structural and functional analysis of variants in which the zinc ligands H94 and H119 are substituted with asparagine and glutamine. and comparison with results obtained with aspartate and glutamate substitutions indicate that the neutral ligand field provided by the protein optimizes the electrostatic environment for the catalytic function of the metal ion. including stabilization of bound anions. This is demonstrated by catalytic activity measurements for ester hydrolysis and CO2 hydration. as well as sulfonamide inhibitor affinity assays.

Spx,2005,Shunji Nakano and Kyle N Erwin and Martina Ralle and Peter Zuber,55,Molecular microbiology,2,498-510,Blackwell Science Ltd,The Spx protein is indispensable for survival of Bacillus subtilis under disulphide stress. Its interaction with the α‐subunit of RNA polymerase is required for transcriptional induction of genes that function in thiol homeostasis. such as thioredoxin (trxA) and thioredoxin reductase (trxB). The N‐terminal end of Spx contains a Cys–X–X–Cys (CXXC) motif. which is a likely target for redox‐sensitive control. We show here that Spx directly activates trxA and ‐B transcription by interacting with the RNA polymerase α‐subunit. but it does so only under an oxidized condition. The transcriptional activation by Spx requires formation of an intramolecular disulphide bond between two cysteine residues that reside in the CXXC motif.

Mutations in WNDP lead to a severe metabolic disorder. Wilson's disease. The function of WNDP depends on Atox1. a cytosolic metallochaperone that delivers copper to WNDP. We demonstrate that the metal-binding site 2 (MBS2) in the N-terminal domain of WNDP (N-WNDP) plays an important role in this process. The transfer of one copper from Atox1 to N-WNDP results in selective protection of the metal-coordinating cysteines in MBS2 against labeling with a cysteine-directed probe. Such selectivity is not observed when free copper is added to N-WNDP. Similarly. site-directed mutagenesis of MBS2 eliminates stimulation of the catalytic activity of WNDP by the copper-Atox1 complex but not by free copper.

Here we report that a nicked HJ is the preferred substrate of endogenous and recombinant Mus81-Eme1. Cleavage occurs specifically on the strand that opposes the nick. resulting in resolution of the structure into linear duplex products. Resolving cuts made by the endogenous Mus81-Eme1 complex on an intact HJ are quasi-simultaneous. indicating that Mus81-Eme1 resolves HJs by a nick and counternick mechanism. with a large rate enhancement of the second cut arising from the flexible nature of the nicked HJ intermediate.

Multiple linear chromosomes. an abundance of regulatory elements. and chromosome packaging are all challenges that the eukaryotic DNA replication machinery must successfully overcome. The replication machinery. the “replisome” complex. is composed of many specialized proteins with functions in supporting replication by DNA polymerases. Efficient replisome progression relies on tight coordination between the various factors of the replisome. Further. replisome progression must occur on less than ideal templates at various genomic loci. Here. we describe the functions of the major replisome components. as well as some of the obstacles to efficient DNA replication that the replisome confronts.

The mechanism of this specific toxicity is not fully understood. Recently. it has been discovered that O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is enriched in the β-cells. It has been proposed that STZ toxicity may be due to its inhibition of neutral O-GlcNAcase activity. the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from cytosolic proteins (K. Liu et al.. 2000. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Unfortunately. DNA can degrade in the environment. sometimes below the level at which it can be amplified by PCR. Protein however is chemically more robust than DNA and can persist for longer periods. Protein also contains genetic variation in the form of single amino acid polymorphisms. These can be used to infer the status of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism alleles. To demonstrate this. we used mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics to characterize hair shaft proteins in 66 European-American subjects. A total of 596 single nucleotide polymorphism alleles were correctly imputed in 32 loci from 22 genes of subjects’ DNA and directly validated using Sanger sequencing. Estimates of the probability of resulting individual non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism allelic profiles in the European population. using the product rule. resulted in a maximum power of discrimination of 1 in 12.500. Imputed non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism profiles from European–American subjects were considerably less frequent in the African population (maximum likelihood ratio = 11.000). The converse was true for hair shafts collected from an additional 10 subjects with African ancestry. where some profiles were more frequent in the African population.

The present study addressed the role of cannabinoid receptors during remote cell death of central neurons in a model that is based on cerebellar lesions. A lesion in one cerebellar hemisphere induced remote cell death and type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) expression in contralateral precerebellar neurons. Of the selective agonists and antagonists that modulated cannabinoid receptor activity. we found that the CB2R agonist JWH-015 reduced neuronal loss and cytochrome-c release. leading to neurological recovery; these effects were reversed by the selective CB2R antagonist SR144528. Analysis of CB2R-triggered signal transduction demonstrated that in axotomized neurons.

The biological activity of anandamide. a prominent member of this group. depends on the metabolic control exerted by biosynthetic. catabolic and oxidative pathways working together. Cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of anandamide are crucial steps in the process. Whereas the identity of anandamide transmembrane carriers remains undetermined. recent insights have been gained related to its intracellular stores (adiposomes) and intracellular binding proteins. particularly fatty acid binding proteins. albumin and heat shock protein 70. On this basis. we propose a reconsideration of the dogma that endocannabinoids are exclusively synthesized and released ‘on demand’. and suggest that their metabolic control is complemented by intracellular trafficking and storage in specific reservoirs.,True,FUlF5iAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,167,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000964,609384234951822201,/scholar?cites=609384234951822201,,https://www.academia.edu/download/64725273/j.tibs.2010.05.00820201020-23547-1srf323.pdf,0,0,0

One of the major hurdles to a deeper understanding of these pathological processes is the absence of clearly defined inductive mechanisms. which. if identified and characterised. could guide clinical strategies for their prevention or allow therapeutic intervention. Molecular mimicry leading to crossreactive autoimmune responses has gained strong experimental support in the past decade. A fundamental premise of this hypothesis is the involvement of a mimicking environmental trigger. In view of the numerous viral and bacterial agents epidemiologically linked to autoimmune liver diseases. we and others have proposed molecular mimicry to be an important mechanism in these diseases.

Biofilm-dwelling bacteria are particularly resistant to antibiotics. making it hard to eradicate biofilm-associated infections. Bacteria rely on efflux pumps to get rid of toxic substances. We discovered that efflux pumps are highly active in bacterial biofilms. thus making efflux pumps attractive targets for antibiofilm measures. A number of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) are known. EPIs were shown to reduce biofilm formation. and in combination they could abolish biofilm formation completely. Also. EPIs were able to block the antibiotic tolerance of biofilms.

Conventional antibiotics generally kill bacteria by interfering with vital cellular functions. an approach that imposes selection pressure for resistant bacteria. New approaches are urgently needed. Targeting bacterial virulence functions directly is an attractive alternative. An obvious target is bacterial adhesion. Bacterial adhesion to surfaces is the first step in colonization. invasion. and biofilm formation. As such. adhesion represents the Achilles heel of crucial pathogenic functions. It follows that interference with adhesion can reduce bacterial virulence. Here. we illustrate this important topic with examples of techniques being developed that can inhibit bacterial adhesion.

It has an optimum growth temperature of 83°C and is described as a strict anaerobe. Its genome lacks any homologue of canonical superoxide (O2·−) dismutases.

TheKmfor sulfite in the MV+•:sulfite oxidoreductase assay is 0.75 mM. and the specific activity 2.06 μmolH2/min/mg. Visible and EPR spectroscopies studies indicate that the enzyme high-spin heme reacts with sulfite in the oxidised state. and that sulfide partially reduces the enzyme.

Dnm1. which is a yeast DRP (Drp1/Dlp1 in humans). is required for mitochondrial division. but its mechanism is unknown. We provide evidence that Dnm1 likely functions through self-assembly to drive the membrane constriction event that is associated with mitochondrial division. Two regulatory features of Dnm1 self-assembly were also identified. Dnm1 self-assembly proceeded through a rate-limiting nucleation step. and nucleotide hydrolysis by assembled Dnm1 structures was highly cooperative with respect to GTP. Dnm1 formed extended spirals. which possessed diameters greater than those of dynamin-1 spirals but whose sizes. remarkably. were equal to those of mitochondrial constriction sites in vivo.

The yeast dynamin-related protein Dnm1 has been localized to sites of mitochondrial division. Using cryo-EM. we have determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of Dnm1 in a GTP-bound state.

Dnm1 constricted liposomes and subsequently dissociated from the lipid bilayer. The magnitude of Dnm1 constriction was substantially larger than the decrease in diameter previously reported for dynamin.

We find that the core lipid-binding domain found in all ORPs can simultaneously bind two membranes. Using Osh4p/Kes1p as a representative ORP. we show that ORPs have at least two membrane-binding surfaces; one near the mouth of the sterol-binding pocket and a distal site that can bind a second membrane.

Some of these abnormal metabolites are reconverted to normal metabolites by repair enzymes. which play therefore a role akin to the proofreading activities of DNA polymerases and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. An illustrative example of such repair enzymes is L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. which eliminates a metabolite abnormally made by a Krebs cycle enzyme. Mutations in L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase lead to L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. a leukoencephalopathy. Other examples are the epimerase and the ATP-dependent dehydratase that repair hydrated forms of NADH and NADPH; ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. which eliminates an abnormal metabolite formed …,True,tvTdOhEAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,66,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10545-012-9571-1,12490993606893415832,/scholar?cites=12490993606893415832,,,0,0,0

The consideration of gene expression correlation over a time or tissue dimension has proved valuable in predicting gene function. Here. we consider correlations over a genetic dimension. In addition to identifying coregulated genes. the genetic dimension also supplies us with information about the genomic locations of putative regulatory loci. We calculated correlations among approximately 45.000 expression traits derived from 60 individuals in an F2 sample segregating for obesity and diabetes. By combining the correlation results with linkage mapping information. we were able to identify regulatory networks. make functional predictions for uncharacterized genes. and characterize novel members of known pathways. We found evidence of coordinate regulation of 174 G protein–coupled receptor protein signaling pathway expression traits.

The multifactorial causes of obesity include several genetic. dietary and lifestyle variables that together result in an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Dietary approaches to limit fat intake are commonly prescribed to achieve the hypocaloric conditions necessary for weight loss. But dietary fat restriction is often accompanied by increased carbohydrate intake. which can dramatically increase endogenous fatty acid synthesis depending upon carbohydrate composition. Since both dietary and endogenously synthesized fatty acids contribute to the whole-body fatty acid pool. obesity can therefore result from excessive fat or carbohydrate consumption.

Dichloroacetate (DCA) has recently been proposed as a novel and relatively non-toxic anti-cancer agent that can reverse the glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells through the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. We have examined the effect of DCA against breast cancer cells. including in a highly metastatic in vivo model. The growth of several breast cancer cell lines was found to be inhibited by DCA in vitro.

In the 10 years since the first knockout of the mouse p53 tumor suppressor gene (designated Trp53) was published. much has been learned about the contribution of p53 to biology and tumor suppression in the breast through the use of p53 transgenic and knockout mice. The original mice deficient in p53 showed no mammary gland phenotype. However. studies using BALB/c-Trp53-deficient mice have demonstrated a delayed involution phenotype and a mammary tumor phenotype. Together with other studies of mutant p53 transgenes and p53 bitransgenics. a greater understanding has been gained of the role of p53 in involution. of the regulation of p53 activity by hormones. of the effect of mouse strain and modifier genes on tumor phenotype. and of the cooperation between p53 and other oncogenic pathways. chemical carcinogens and hormonal stimulation in mammary tumorigenesis.

But transport of various drugs like a diuretic. furosemide (FUR). via albumin in uremia is seriously compromised due to accumulation of uremic toxins. The reason behind it is explored by investigating the binding mechanism of FUR to HSA. Isothermal titration calorimetry results show that FUR binds with HSA at high (Kb ∼ 104) and low affinity (Kb ∼ 103) sites whereas spectroscopic results predict binding at a single site (Kb ∼ 105). Thermodynamic analysis shows that the HSA-FUR complex formation occurs via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions and undergoes slight structural changes. as evident by FTIR and far-UV CD.

These pollutants when ingested are transported in the blood by proteins like human serum albumin (HSA). Binding of these pollutants to HSA has been explored to elucidate the specific selectivity of molecular recognition by this multiligand binding protein. The association constants (Kb) of these pollutants to HSA were moderate (104–105 M−1). The proximity of the ligands to HSA is also revealed by their average binding distance. r. which is estimated to be in the range of 4.39–5.37 nm. The binding free energy (ΔG) in each case remains effectively the same for each site because of enthalpy–entropy compensation (EEC). The difference observed between ΔCpexp and ΔCpcalc are suggested to be caused by binding–induced flexibility changes in the HSA. Efforts are also made to elaborate the differences observed in binding isotherms obtained through multiple approaches of calorimetry. spectroscopy and bioinformatics. We suggest that difference in dissociation constants of pollutants by calorimetry. spectroscopic and computational approaches could correspond to occurrence of different set of populations of pollutants having different molecular characteristics in ground state and excited state. Furthermore. our observation of enhanced binding of pollutants (2N and 8H) in the presence of hemin signifies that ligands like hemin may enhance the storage period of these pollutants in blood that may even facilitate the ill effects of these pollutants.,True,QCY9Vu8AAAAJ:hEXC_dOfxuUC,97,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026186,10580241837816225036,/scholar?cites=10580241837816225036,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026186,0,0,0

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the renal elimination of uremic toxin creatinine that accumulate in chronic renal failure. Quantitative investigation of the plausible correlations was performed by spectroscopy. calorimetry. molecular docking and accessibility of surface area. Alkalinization of normal plasma from pH 7.0 to 9.0 modifies the distribution of toxin in the body and therefore may affect both the accumulation and the rate of toxin elimination. The ligand loading of HSA with uremic toxin predicts several key side chain interactions of site I that presumably have the potential to impact the specificity and impaired drug binding.

While these organisms appear to be more closely related to the Methanosarcinales in ribosomal-based phylogenetic analyses. they are metabolically more similar to Class I methanogens.  Methodology/Principal Findings In order to improve our understanding of this lineage. we have completely sequenced the genomes of two members of this order. Methanocorpusculum labreanum Z and Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1. and compared them with the genome of a third. Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1. Similar to Class I methanogens. Methanomicrobiales use a partial reductive citric acid cycle for 2-oxoglutarate biosynthesis. and they have the Eha energy-converting hydrogenase. In common with Methanosarcinales. Methanomicrobiales possess the Ech hydrogenase and at least some of them may couple formylmethanofuran formation and heterodisulfide reduction to transmembrane ion gradients. Uniquely. M. labreanum and M. hungatei contain hydrogenases similar to the Pyrococcus furiosus Mbh hydrogenase. and all three Methanomicrobiales have anti-sigma factor and anti-anti-sigma factor regulatory proteins not found in other methanogens. Phylogenetic analysis based on seven core proteins of methanogenesis and cofactor biosynthesis places the Methanomicrobiales equidistant from Class I methanogens and Methanosarcinales.

In this report we demonstrate that a novel transmembrane protein. TmpL. is necessary for regulation of intracellular ROS levels and tolerance to external ROS. and is required for infection of plants by the necrotroph Alternaria brassicicola and for infection of mammals by the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. In both fungi. tmpL encodes a predicted hybrid membrane protein containing an AMP-binding domain. six putative transmembrane domains. and an experimentally-validated FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain. Localization and gene expression analyses in A. brassicicola indicated that TmpL is associated with the Woronin body. a specialized peroxisome. and strongly expressed during conidiation and initial invasive growth in planta. A. brassicicola and A. fumigatus ΔtmpL strains exhibited abnormal conidiogenesis. accelerated aging. enhanced oxidative burst during conidiation. and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress when compared to wild-type or reconstituted strains. Moreover. A. brassicicola ΔtmpL strains. although capable of initial penetration. exhibited dramatically reduced invasive growth on Brassicas and Arabidopsis. Similarly. an A. fumigatus ΔtmpL mutant was dramatically less virulent than the wild-type and reconstituted strains in a murine model of invasive aspergillosis.

Physiologically relevant reactions in the mycobacteria that use Fgd-generated reduced F420 (F420H2) are unknown. In this work. F420H2 was found to be oxidized by NO only in the presence of oxygen. Further analysis demonstrated that NO2. produced from NO and O2. was the oxidant. UV-visible spectroscopic and NO-sensor-based analyses proved that F420H2 reduced NO2 to NO.

The pattern of expression and sugar regulation of the six Arabidopsis thaliana ADP-Glc PPase-encoding genes (two small subunits. ApS1 and ApS2; and four large subunits. ApL1–ApL4) has been studied. Based on mRNA expression. ApS1 is the main small subunit or catalytic isoform responsible for ADP-Glc PPase activity in all tissues of the plant. Large subunits play a regulatory role. and the data presented define a clear functional distinction among them. ApL1 is the main large subunit in source tissues. whereas ApL3 and. to a lesser extent.

However. few studies have been carried out to characterize the regulation of GBSSI gene. Regulation of starch synthesis genes is especially interesting in photosynthetic tissues. where starch is subjected to a periodical alternation of synthesis and degradation during the day/night cycle. In this report we show a circadian oscillation of GBSSI mRNA levels in leaves of Arabidopsis during the day/night cycle. and provide evidence that GBSSI expression is controlled by the transcription factors CCA1 and LHY.

In this way the renormalization problem for composite lattice operators is avoided altogether. and the connection to the DA is done using perturbation theory in the continuum. As an example. the correlation function of two electromagnetic currents is calculated to the next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy in perturbation theory and including the twist-four corrections. We argue that this strategy is fully competitive with direct lattice measurements of the moments of the DA. defined as matrix elements of local operators. and offers new insight in the space-time picture of hard exclusive reactions. ,True,pjqGZCoAAAAJ:Ic1VZgkJnDsC,96,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-008-0608-4,14794844702793289437,/scholar?cites=14794844702793289437,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.1348,0,0,0

The efficiency with which nucleic acids bind to these surfaces is not high. because they can be washed away. especially in the case of spotting oligonucleotides. In view of this. we have developed a method to increase the binding capacity and efficiency of hybridization of DNA on to derivatized glass surfaces. This makes use of the synergistic effect of two binding interactions between the nucleic acids and the coating chemicals on the surface of the glass slides. The enhanced binding allows the nucleic acids to be bound tightly and to survive stringency washes. When immobilized.

This may partially be due to negligence of the importance of environmental photoperiodic conditions and to the time of day of administration. In order to test whether the effect of melatonin on tumor growth is dependent on the photoperiod and the time of day of administration. the present experiments were carried out. It appears that under long photoperiods melatonin shows opposite effects on fibrosarcoma ascites and Ehrlich solid tumors depending on the time of the day at which the compound was administered.

On the basis of this compilation of data it can be discussed under which conditions melatonin may be used for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes in clinical oncology. Melatonin is depressed in patients with cancers of different origins during the phase of primary tumour growth whereas a normal or sometimes elevated pineal melatonin secretory activity is found during early stages of tumour development or when recidivations arise. The clinical studies of Lissoni show that melatonin. particularly if combined with interleukin-2. is able to favourably influence the course of advanced malignant disease leading to a prolonged survival as well as to an improved quality of life. These findings require to be verified by independent and controlled replication studies. If they can be confirmed it should be attempted to administer melatonin to patients with earlier stages of cancer parallel to standard oncological treatment regimens. In such trials it should be tested whether a substitutional therapy in patients with endogenously depressed melatonin may favourably affect the course of the disease both in quantitative (inhibitory effect on tumour growth and spread) and qualitative terms (improved performance status).,True,f2f91eIAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,104,https://europepmc.org/article/med/12019349,3024620176006839551,/scholar?cites=3024620176006839551,,,0,0,0

Seasonal changes of nocturnal aMT6s excretion were found with peak levels in summer despite constant photoperiods.

Experimental studies show that melatonin controls not only the growth of well-differentiated cancers. but also possesses anti-carcinogenic properties. Therefore. it is plausible that disturbances of circadian melatonin rhythmicity could be functionally involved in elevated cancer risks among aircrew members and nurses frequently working on night shifts. Due to the suppression of melatonin by light it can be assumed that too much artificial light at night could. at least in part. be responsible for generally increasing rates of e.g. breast cancer in industrialized countries.

Point mutations in cytoplasmic loops six (L6) and eight (L8) of yeast Sec61p cause reductions in growth rates and defects in the translocation of nascent polypeptides that use the cotranslational translocation pathway. Sec61 heterotrimers isolated from the L8 sec61 mutants have a greatly reduced affinity for 80S ribosomes. Cytoplasmic accumulation of protein precursors demonstrates that the initial contact between the large ribosomal subunit and the Sec61 complex is important for efficient insertion of a nascent polypeptide into the translocation pore.

Disruption of the SBH2 gene. which encodes the β subunit of the Ssh1p complex. likewise causes a growth defect when combined with SRβ-ΔTM.

The CBD contains α- and β-subdomains with cAMP binding to a phosphate binding cassette (PBC) in the β-sandwich. The major receptors for cAMP in mammalian cells are the regulatory subunits (R-subunits) of PKA where cAMP and the catalytic subunit compete for the same CBD. The R-subunits inhibit kinase activity. whereas cAMP releases that inhibition. Here. we use NMR to map at residue resolution the cAMP-dependent interaction network of the CBD-A domain of isoform Iα of the R-subunit of PKA. Based on H/D. H/H. and Nz exchange data. we propose a molecular model for the allosteric regulation of PKA by cAMP.

RasGRP1 is important in some cancers and autoimmune diseases but. in contrast to SOS. its regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Activating signals lead to the membrane recruitment of RasGRP1 and Ras engagement. but it is unclear how interactions between RasGRP1 and Ras are suppressed in the absence of such signals. We present a crystal structure of a fragment of RasGRP1 in which the Ras-binding site is blocked by an interdomain linker and the membrane-interaction surface of RasGRP1 is hidden within a dimerization interface that may be stabilized by the C-terminal oligomerization domain. NMR data demonstrate that calcium binding to the regulatory module generates substantial conformational changes that are incompatible with the inactive assembly. These features allow RasGRP1 to be maintained in an inactive state that is poised for activation by calcium and membrane-localization signals.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00813.001,True,Wtgg5V0AAAAJ:UuEBAcK4md4C,69,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00813,13934811280915992936,/scholar?cites=13934811280915992936,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00813.pdf,0,0,0

The CBD maintains EPAC in a state of auto-inhibition in the absence of the allosteric effector. cAMP. When cAMP binds to the CBD such auto-inhibition is released. leading to EPAC activation. It has been shown that a key feature of such cAMP-dependent activation process is the partial destabilization of a structurally conserved hinge helix at the C-terminus of the CBD. However. the role of this helix in auto-inhibition is currently not fully understood. Here we utilize a series of progressive deletion mutants that mimic the hinge helix destabilization caused by cAMP to show that such helix is also a pivotal auto-inhibitory element of apo-EPAC. The effect of the deletion mutations on the auto-inhibitory apo/inactive vs. apo/active equilibrium was evaluated using recently developed NMR chemical shift projection and covariance analysis methods. Our results show that. even in the absence of cAMP. the C-terminal region of the hinge helix is tightly coupled to other conserved allosteric structural elements of the CBD and perturbations that destabilize the hinge helix shift the auto-inhibitory equilibrium toward the apo/active conformations. These findings explain the apparently counterintuitive observation that cAMP binds more tightly to shorter than longer EPAC constructs. These results are relevant for CBDs in general and rationalize why substrates sensitize CBD-containing systems to cAMP.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates target genes by associating with specific DNA binding sites. the sequences of which differ between genes. Traditionally. these binding sites have been viewed only as docking sites. Using structural. biochemical. and cell-based assays. we show that GR binding sequences. differing by as little as a single base pair. differentially affect GR conformation and regulatory activity.

They convey signals through the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR). which upon binding to ligands. associates with genomic glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) to regulate transcription of associated genes. One mechanism by which glucocorticoids inhibit inflammation is through induction of the dual specificity phosphatase-1 (DUSP1. a.k.a. mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1. MKP-1) gene.  Methodology/Principal Findings We found that glucocorticoids rapidly increased transcription of DUSP1 within 10 minutes in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) scanning. we located a GR binding region between −1421 and −1118 upstream of the DUSP1 transcription start site. This region is active in a reporter system. and mutagenesis analyses identified a functional GRE located between −1337 and −1323. We found that glucocorticoids increased DNase I hypersensitivity. reduced nucleosome density. and increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation within genomic regions surrounding the GRE. ChIP experiments showed that p300 was recruited to the DUSP1 GRE. and RNA interference experiments demonstrated that reduction of p300 decreased glucocorticoid-stimulated DUSP1 gene expression and histone H3 hyperacetylation.

In this study. we further investigated the mechanism of this regulation. First. thermal and urea denaturation experiments demonstrated that phosphorylation of the predominantly unstructured SRR imparts enhanced thermodynamic stability on the well-folded ETS domain and its inhibitory module. We next identified a minimal fragment (residues 279–440) that exhibits both enhanced autoinhibition of Ets-1 DNA-binding and allosteric reinforcement by phosphorylation.

Along with other “foldamer” systems. peptoid oligomer sequences can be predictably designed to form a variety of stable secondary structures. It is not yet evident if foldamer design can be extended to reliably create tertiary structure features that mimic more complex biomolecular folds and functions. Computational modeling and prediction of peptoid conformations will likely play a critical role in enabling complex biomimetic designs.

The relative energies of rotamers partially determine which side chain conformations are more often observed in protein structures and accurate estimates of these energies are important for predicting protein structure and designing new proteins. Protein modelers typically calculate side chain rotamer energies by using molecular mechanics (MM) potentials or by converting rotamer probabilities from the protein database (PDB) into relative free energies. One limitation of the knowledge‐based energies is that rotamer preferences observed in the PDB can reflect internal side chain energies as well as longer‐range interactions with the rest of the protein.

While Trk receptor activation has been well-studied and triggers the well-characterized Ras/Rap-MAPK. PI3K-Akt. and PLCγ-PKC cascades. p75NTR signaling is more complex. and its in vivo significance has not yet been completely determined. In the last few years. p75NTR has received much attention mainly due to recent findings describing pro-neurotrophins as new ligands for the receptor and the ability of the receptor to form different complexes with other transmembrane proteins.

Once activated. Trk receptors are internalized and targeted for degradation. However. the mechanisms implicated in this process are incompletely understood. Here we report that the Trk receptors are multimonoubiquitinated in response to neurotrophins. We have identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Nedd4-2. that associates with the TrkA receptor and is phosphorylated upon NGF binding. The binding of Nedd4-2 to TrkA through a PPXY motif leads to the ubiquitination and downregulation of TrkA. Activated TrkA receptor levels and the survival of NGF-dependent sensory neurons. but not BDNF-dependent sensory neurons. are directly influenced by Nedd4-2 expression. Unexpectedly.

This neurotoxic substance is encountered in artisanal gold mining. coal combustion. oil and gas refining. waste incineration. chloralkali plant operation. metallurgy. and areas of agriculture in which mercury‐rich fungicides are used. Thousands of tonnes of mercury are emitted annually through these activities. With the Minamata Convention on Mercury entering force this year. increasing regulation of mercury pollution is imminent. It is therefore critical to provide inexpensive and scalable mercury sorbents. The research herein addresses this need by introducing low‐cost mercury sorbents made solely from sulfur and unsaturated cooking oils.

The receptor-mediated cellular uptake of LDL is triggered by apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100). which represents the single protein moiety of LDL. Due to the size and hydrophobic nature of apoB-100. its structure is not well characterized. Here we present a low resolution structure of solubilized apoB-100. We have used small angle neutron scattering in combination with advanced shape reconstruction algorithms to generate a three-dimensional model of lipid-free apoB-100.

J. Bot,2,703-710,,Seed storage protein profiles of 8 kabuli (white seeded) chickpea mutants/genotypes were analysed by Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Total soluble proteins were resolved on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels. Low variability in tested kabuli germplasm was observed. On the bases of seed protein banding patterns. 5 genotypes could be identified clearly and biochemical fingerprints of these varieties are reported. Dendrogram based on electrophoretic data clustered the genotypes in three groups. Three genotypes viz.. Pb-1. CM-94/99 and PKV Kabuli 2 showed 100% homology therefore could not be separated on the bases of seed storage proteins. One exotic genotype ILC-195 and two mutants CM-2000 and CM-98/99 were comparatively divergent from other genotypes. Identified protein markers ie. KSSP-100. KSSP-93 and KSSP-64 can be used for identification of CM-98/99. ILC-195 and CM-2000 respectively. Moreover CM-315/99 and Noor-91 can also be identified by combination of identified protein markers.

These toxins preferentially bind to membranes containing sphingomyelin and create cation-selective pores by oligomerization of 3–4 monomers. In this work we have studied the binding of EqtII to lipid membranes by the use of lipid monolayers and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The binding is a two-step process. separately mediated by two regions of the molecule. An exposed aromatic cluster involving tryptophans 112 and 116 mediates the initial attachment that is prerequisite for the next step. Steric shielding of the aromatic cluster or mutation of Trp-112 and -116 to phenylalanine significantly reduces the toxin-lipid interaction. The second step is promoted by the N-terminal amphiphilic helix. which translocates into the lipid phase.

Real-time quantitative PCR has enabled high-throughput detection and quantification of pathogens; however. its quantitative use is linked to standardized reference materials. and its sensitivity to inhibitors can lead to lower quantification accuracy. Droplet digital PCR has been proposed as a method to overcome these drawbacks. Its absolute quantification does not rely on standards and its tolerance to inhibitors has been demonstrated mostly in clinical samples. Such features would be of great use in agricultural and environmental fields. therefore our study compared the performance of droplet digital PCR method when challenged with inhibitors common to plant and environmental samples and compared it with quantitative PCR. Transfer of an existing Pepper mild mottle virus assay from reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR to reverse transcription droplet digital PCR was straight forward. When challenged with complex matrices (seeds. plants. soil. wastewater) and selected purified inhibitors droplet digital PCR showed higher resilience to inhibition for the quantification of an RNA virus (Pepper mild mottle virus). compared to reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR.

Ltd,Replicative DNA polymerases are multiprotein machines that are tethered to DNA during chain extension by sliding clamp proteins. The clamps are designed to encircle DNA completely. and they are manipulated rapidly onto DNA by the ATP-dependent activity of a clamp loader. We outline the detailed mechanism of γ complex. a five-protein clamp loader that is part of the Escherichia coli replicase. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The γ complex uses ATP to open the β clamp and assemble it onto DNA. Surprisingly. ATP is not needed for γ complex to crack open the β clamp. The function of ATP is to regulate the activity of one subunit. δ. which opens the clamp simply by binding to it. The δ subunit acts as a modulator of the interaction between δ and β. On binding ATP. the γ complex is activated such that the δ subunit permits δ to bind β and crack open the ring at one interface.

The clamp is assembled on DNA by a clamp loader. This report shows that the polymerase and clamp loader coordinate their actions with the clamp by competing for it through overlapping binding sites. The competition is modulated by DNA. In the absence of DNA. the clamp associates with the clamp loader. But after the clamp is placed on DNA. the polymerase develops a tight grip on the clamp and out-competes the clamp loader. After replication of the template. the polymerase looses affinity for the clamp.

One main in vivo target of ROS is the thiol group of proteins. We have developed a quantitative thiol trapping technique termed OxICAT to identify physiologically important target proteins of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hypochlorite (NaOCl) stress in vivo. OxICAT allows the precise quantification of oxidative thiol modifications in hundreds of different proteins in a single experiment. It also identifies the affected proteins and defines their redox-sensitive cysteine(s). Using this technique. we identified a group of Escherichia coli proteins with significantly (30–90%) oxidatively modified thiol groups. which appear to be specifically sensitive to either H2O2 or NaOCl stress.

1025795,Protein thiol modifications visualized in vivo,2004,Lars I Leichert and Ursula Jakob,2,PLoS Biol,11,e333,Public Library of Science,Thiol-disulfide interconversions play a crucial role in the chemistry of biological systems. They participate in the major systems that control the cellular redox potential and prevent oxidative damage. In addition. thiol-disulfide exchange reactions serve as molecular switches in a growing number of redox-regulated proteins. We developed a differential thiol-trapping technique combined with two-dimensional gel analysis. which in combination with genetic studies. allowed us to obtain a snapshot of the in vivo thiol status of cellular proteins. We determined the redox potential of protein thiols in vivo. identified and dissected the in vivo substrate proteins of the major cellular thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. and discovered proteins that undergo thiol modifications during oxidative stress. Under normal growth conditions most cytosolic proteins had reduced cysteines. confirming existing dogmas. Among the few partly oxidized cytosolic proteins that we detected were proteins that are known to form disulfide bond intermediates transiently during their catalytic cycle (e.g.. dihydrolipoyl transacetylase and lipoamide dehydrogenase). Most proteins with highly oxidized thiols were periplasmic proteins and were found to be in vivo substrates of the disulfide-bond-forming protein DsbA. We discovered a substantial number of redox-sensitive cytoplasmic proteins. whose thiol groups were significantly oxidized in strains lacking thioredoxin A. These included detoxifying enzymes as well as many metabolic enzymes with active-site cysteines that were not known to be substrates for thioredoxin.

Strongly induced genes included known oxidative stress genes that are under the control of the global repressor PerR and heat shock genes controlled by the global repressor CtsR.

Inc.,      Cysteines play an important role in protein biochemistry. The unique chemical property and high reactivity of the free thiol group makes reduced cysteine a versatile component of catalytic centers and metal binding sites in many cytosolic proteins and oxidized cystine a stabilizing component in many secreted proteins. Moreover. cysteines readily react with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to form reversible oxidative thiol modifications. As a result. these reversible thiol modifications have found a use as regulatory nano-switches in an increasing number of redox sensitive proteins. These redox-regulated proteins are able to adjust their activity quickly in response to changes in their redox environment.

GABA is transported into A. tumefaciens via an ABC transporter dependent on the periplasmic binding protein Atu2422. We demonstrate that expression of atu2422 and two other ABC transporter genes is downregulated by the conserved small RNA (sRNA) AbcR1 (for ABC regulator). AbcR1 is encoded in tandem with another sRNA. which is similar in sequence and structure.

Besides fundamental limits imposed by radiation damage. poor detectors and beam-induced sample movement have been shown to degrade attainable resolutions. A new generation of direct electron detectors may ameliorate both effects. Apart from exhibiting improved signal-to-noise performance. these cameras are also fast enough to follow particle movements during electron irradiation. Here. we assess the potentials of this technology for cryo-EM structure determination. Using a newly developed statistical movie processing approach to compensate for beam-induced movement. we show that ribosome reconstructions with unprecedented resolutions may be calculated from almost two orders of magnitude fewer particles than used previously.

AM rapidly reduced the gene transcript level of TNF-α. inducing a maximal effect within 1 h. The inhibitory effect of AM was restored with an AM receptor antagonist as well as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor. These findings indicate that AM is a potent and quick suppressor of TNF-α production in Swiss 3T3 cells acting through the cAMP protein kinase A pathway.

India,Wireless technologies are ubiquitous today and the mobile phones are one of the prodigious output of this technology. Although the familiarization and dependency of mobile phones is growing at an alarming pace. the biological effects due to the exposure of radiations have become a subject of intense debate. The present evidence on mobile phone radiation exposure is based on scientific research and public policy initiative to give an overview of what is known of biological effects that occur at radiofrequency (RF)/ electromagnetic fields (EMFs) exposure. The conflict in conclusions is mainly because of difficulty in controlling the affecting parameters. Biological effects are dependent not only on the distance and size of the object (with respect to the object) but also on the environmental parameters. Health endpoints reported to be associated with RF include childhood leukemia. brain tumors. genotoxic effects. neurological effects and neurodegenerative diseases. immune system deregulation. allergic and inflammatory responses. infertility and some cardiovascular effects. Most of the reports conclude a reasonable suspicion of mobile phone risk that exists based on clear evidence of bio-effects which with prolonged exposures may reasonably be presumed to result in health impacts.

A key nucleotide‐sensing element and a Pink1 phosphorylation site both lie within an extensive EF hand–cGTPase interface.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The last five years have seen exciting advances in our understanding of the structure of the nucleosome core particle. the basic repeating unit in all eukaryotic chromatin. A picture emerges in which nucleosomal DNA. while distorted and compacted fivefold by tight interactions with the histone octamer core. is at the same time highly dynamic and adaptable. Here. we summarize the salient features from recent structural studies of nucleosome core particles (both published and unpublished) that concern the structure and dynamics of nucleosomal DNA. and the nature of protein–DNA interactions. Current mechanisms for chromatin remodeling and nucleosome sliding are discussed in light of new structural evidence. Finally. techniques to study nucleosome stability and ultimately dynamics are introduced. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

It allows one to study the structure of native particles in near physiological environments and to analyze structural changes in response to variations in external conditions. The combination of microfluidics and SAXS provides a powerful tool to investigate dynamic processes on a molecular level with sub-millisecond time resolution. Reaction kinetics in the sub-millisecond time range has been achieved using continuous-flow mixers manufactured using micromachining techniques. The time resolution of these devices has previously been limited. in part. by the X-ray beam sizes delivered by typical SAXS beamlines. These limitations can be overcome using optics to focus X-rays to the micrometer size range providing that beam divergence and photon flux suitable for performing SAXS …,True,hl3dujIAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,58,https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?ys5080,6800540231755699046,/scholar?cites=6800540231755699046,,https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?ys5080,0,0,0

The reason is that beads are treated as point sources of friction. This can be remedied by introducing terms that are neglected in the conventional treatment of orders 0 and −3 in interbead distances. An alternative strategy is the cubic substitution in which each bead is replaced by a cubic array of minibeads. These procedures require a computational overload that. in the case of the intrinsic viscosity. can be avoided using an estimate of the correction due to the nonzero volume of the beads.

B,5,955-961,,The conventional Kirkwood−Riseman calculation of the hydrodynamic properties of bead models gives abnormal results for rotational quantities and the intrinsic viscosities for models with a few beads or when one bead is dominant. The reason is that beads are treated as point sources of friction. This can be remedied by introducing terms that are neglected in the conventional treatment of orders 0 and −3 in interbead distances. An alternative strategy is the cubic substitution in which each bead is replaced by a cubic array of minibeads. These procedures require a computational overload that. in the case of the intrinsic viscosity. can be avoided using an estimate of the correction due to the nonzero volume of the beads.

Equivalent radii for different properties present a dependence on size and shape that are more similar than the values of the properties themselves. Furthermore. the ratios of equivalent radii of two properties depend on the conformation (shape or flexibility). but not on the absolute sizes. We define equivalent radii and their ratios. and describe their evaluation for some common models of rigid and flexible macromolecules.

Recently mitoNEET has been shown to be a major role player in the mitochondrial function associated with metabolic type diseases such as obesity and cancers. The anti-diabetic drug pioglitazone and rosiglitazone were the first identified ligands to mitoNEET. Since little is known about structural requirements for ligand binding to mitoNEET. we screened a small set of compounds to gain insight into these requirements. We found that the thiazolidinedione (TZD) warhead as seen in rosiglitazone was not an absolutely necessity for binding to mitoNEET.

The most promising hit. RK207. was docked into the target molecule using a scoring function to compare simulated poses to experimental data. After elucidating possible poses. the hit was further optimized into the lead compound by extension with an electrophilic acrylamide warhead. We believe that focusing on selectivity in this early stage of drug discovery will limit cross-reactivity that might occur with the human ortholog as the lead compound is optimized. Kinetics studies revealed that lead compound 5 modified with an ester group results in higher reactivity than an acrylamide control; however. after modification this compound shows little selectivity for bacterial protein versus the human ortholog. In contrast. hydrolysis of compound 5 to the acid form results in a decrease in the activity of the compound. Together these results suggest that more optimization is warranted for this simple chemical scaffold. and opens the door for discovery of drugs targeted against glutaredoxin proteins—a heretofore untapped reservoir for antibiotic agents.

Mechanisms that reduce cell sensitivity to damage induced by a variety of chemicals were found to be caused by diverse. albeit well-defined. phenotypic alterations. The molecular basis of MDR commonly involves overexpression of the plasma membrane drug efflux pump – P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This glycoprotein is an ABCB1 member of the ABC transporter family. Cells that develop MDR of this type express massive amounts of P-gp that can induce a drug resistance of more than 100 times higher than normal cells to several drugs. which are substrates of P-gp.

In photosynthetic bacteria. the  efficiency of this energy transfer process can be as low as 30%. Here.  we present evidence that an unusual pathway of excited state relaxation  in carotenoids underlies this poor LH function. by which carotenoid  triplet states are generated directly from carotenoid singlet states.

There is evidence that it can elicit in vitro apoptosis in islet β‐cells. but the physical properties that underpin its cytotoxicity have not been clearly elucidated. Here we employed electron microscopy. thioflavin T fluorescence and CD spectroscopy to analyze amylin preparations whose cytotoxic potential was established by live–dead assay in cultured β‐cells. Highly toxic amylin contained few preformed fibrils and initially showed little β‐sheet content. but underwent marked time‐dependent aggregation and β‐conformer formation following dissolution. By contrast. low‐toxicity amylin contained abundant preformed fibrils. and demonstrated high initial β‐sheet content but little propensity to aggregate further once dissolved.

The maximum rates of NO production depend on the oxygen avidity. The hemeproteins with the highest avidity. such as hexacoordinate hemoglobins. retain oxygen even under anoxic conditions resulting in their being extremely effective NO scavengers but essentially incapable of producing NO. Deoxyhemeprotein‐related NO production can be observed in mitochondria (at the levels of cytochrome c oxidase. cytochrome c. complex III and possibly other sites). in plasma membrane. cytosol. endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes.

In greening potato tubers. similar to some procaryotes. formate is directly synthesized via a ferredoxin-dependent fixation of CO2. serving as the main precursor for carbon skeletons in biosynthetic pathways. In other plant species and tissues. formate appears as a side-product of photorespiration and of fermentation pathways. but possibly also as a product of direct CO2 reduction in chloroplasts. Formate metabolism is closely related to serine synthesis and to all subsequent reactions originating from serine.

Two transgenic lines. containing about 60–70% less P-protein in the leaves compared to wild-type potato. were analysed in more detail. The reduction in P-protein amount led to a decrease in the ability of leaf mitochondria to decarboxylate glycine. Photosynthetic and growth rates were reduced but the plants were viable under ambient air and produced tubers. Glycine concentrations within the leaves were elevated up to about 100-fold during illumination. Effects on other amino acids and on sucrose and hexoses were minor.

It produces Shiga toxin. the prototype of a family of closely related bacterial protein toxins. We have determined the structure of the holotoxin. an AB 5 hexamer. by X–ray crystallography. The five B subunits form a pentameric ring. encircling a helix at the carboxy terminus of the A subunit. The A subunit interacts with the B pentamer via this C–terminal helix and a four–stranded mixed β–sheet. The fold of the rest of the A subunit is similar to that of the A chain of the plant toxin ricin; both are N–glycosidases. However. the active site in the bacterial holotoxin is blocked by a segment of polypeptide chain.

Until recently. the roles of cyclic nucleotides in plant cells have proven difficult to uncover. With an understanding of the protein domains which can bind cyclic nucleotides (CNB and GAF domains) we scanned the completed genomes of the higher plants Arabidopsis thaliana (mustard weed) and Oryza sativa (rice) for the effectors of these signalling molecules. Our analysis found that several ion channels and a class of thioesterases constitute the possible cyclic nucleotide binding proteins in plants. Contrary to some reports. we found no biochemical or bioinformatic evidence for a plant cyclic nucleotide regulated protein kinase. suggesting that cyclic nucleotide functions in plants have evolved differently than in mammals.

Molecular and Langevin dynamics simulations show that the flaps need to open for the peptide to bind and that the protease interaction with the substrate influences the flap opening frequency and interval. On the other hand. release of the products does not require flap opening because they can slide out from the binding cleft to the sides of the enzyme. Our data show that in the protease-substrate complex the highest fluctuations correspond to the 17- and 39-turns and the substrate motion is anticorrelated with the 39-turn …,True,yEXwoYUAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,89,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349507712201,12106794459032404891,/scholar?cites=12106794459032404891,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349507712201,0,0,0

An HSV-1 strain with a mutation in vhs is attenuated in virulence and induces immune responses in mice that are protective against corneal infection with virulent HSV-1. but it has the capacity to establish latency. Similarly. a replication-incompetent HSV-1 strain with a mutation in ICP8 elicits an immune response protective against corneal challenge. but it may be limited in viral antigen production. We hypothesized therefore that inactivation of vhs in an ICP8− virus would yield a replication-incompetent mutant with enhanced immunogenicity and protective capacity.

Upon vascular injury. platelets instantly adhere to the exposed extracellular matrix resulting in platelet activation and aggregation to form a hemostatic plug. This self-amplifying mechanism nevertheless requires a tight control to prevent uncontrolled platelet aggregate formation that eventually would occlude the vessel. Therefore endothelial cells produce inhibitory compounds such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide that limit the growth of the platelet thrombus to the damaged area.

Technological advances in 3D-cell culture models bridge the gap between 2D and in vivo models to improve upon the current success rates of cancer drug discovery.  Areas covered:  This review focuses on the multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS). particularly how this model can be utilized for HTS drug discovery. We discuss the current technologies for uniform culture of MCTS suitable for HTS and detection methods utilized for assay development and drug screening.

With the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo. current models suggest that lipids modulate the natural equilibrium between resting and desensitized conformations. We show that the lipid-inactivated nAChR is not desensitized. instead it adopts a novel conformation where the allosteric coupling between its neurotransmitter-binding sites and transmembrane pore is lost. The uncoupling is accompanied by an unmasking of previously buried residues. suggesting weakened association between structurally intact agonist-binding and transmembrane domains.

Previous work has highlighted a conformational selection mechanism. whereby different lipids stabilize different proportions of activatable resting versus nonactivatable conformations. In the absence of anionic lipids and cholesterol. the nAChR adopts an uncoupled conformation. which binds agonist with resting state–like affinity but does not usually undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. Very slow (minutes to hours) transitions from uncoupled to coupled (resting. open and/or desensitized) conformations. however. can occur in membranes with relatively thick hydrophobic cores. Increasing membrane hydrophobic thickness' awakens' uncoupled nAChRs by reducing the large activation energy barrier (or barriers) leading to coupled states. thus …,True,1mk4D-oAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,81,https://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v9/n11/abs/nchembio.1338.html,4822040819646441306,/scholar?cites=4822040819646441306,,,0,0,0

The active site of this family of proteins is their ion channel pore. which is located at the center of the transmembrane domain. The opening/closing motions of the channel pore are governed by the binding of neurotransmitter to the extracellular domain. but also by allosteric effectors acting within the transmembrane domain. Here. we review the structure of the transmembrane domain as well as its role in the allosteric modulation of pentameric ligand-gated ion channel function.

Plk1-dependent Cdc25C1 phosphosites are sufficient to promote mitotic entry. even when Plk1 activity is inhibited.

Aquaporin-based modulator drugs are predicted to be of broad potential utility in the treatment of several diseases. Until today few AQP inhibitors have been described as suitable candidates for clinical development. Here we report on the potent inhibition of AQP3 channels by gold(III) complexes screened on human red blood cells (hRBC) and AQP3-transfected PC12 cells by a stopped-flow method. Among the various metal compounds tested. Auphen is the most active on AQP3 (IC50 = 0.8±0.08 µM in hRBC). Interestingly. the compound poorly affects the water permeability of AQP1. The mechanism of gold inhibition is related to the ability of Au(III) to interact with sulphydryls groups of proteins such as the thiolates of cysteine residues. Additional DFT and modeling studies on possible gold compound/AQP adducts provide a tentative description of the system at a molecular level. The mapping of the periplasmic surface of an homology model of human AQP3 evidenced the thiol group of Cys40 as a likely candidate for binding to gold(III) complexes. Moreover. the investigation of non-covalent binding of Au complexes by docking approaches revealed their preferential binding to AQP3 with respect to AQP1. The high selectivity and low concentration dependent inhibitory effect of Auphen (in the nanomolar range) together with its high water solubility makes the compound a suitable drug lead for future in vivo studies.

It has been reported that this protein contributes to gas permeation (CO2. NO and O2) through the plasma membrane. We show that hypoxia increases Aqp1 mRNA and protein levels in tissues. namely mouse brain and lung. and in cultured cells. the 9L glioma cell line. Stopped-flow light-scattering experiments confirmed an increase in the water permeability of 9L cells exposed to hypoxia. supporting the view that hypoxic Aqp1 up-regulation has a functional role. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulatory process. transcriptional regulation was studied by transient transfections of mouse endothelial cells with a 1297 bp 5′ proximal Aqp1 promoter-luciferase construct. Incubation in hypoxia produced a dose- and time-dependent induction of luciferase activity that was also obtained after treatments with hypoxia mimetics (DMOG and CoCl2) and by overexpressing stabilized mutated forms of HIF-1α. Single mutations or full deletions of the three putative HIF binding domains present in the Aqp1 promoter partially reduced its responsiveness to hypoxia. and transfection with Hif-1α siRNA decreased the in vitro hypoxia induction of Aqp1 mRNA and protein levels. Our results indicate that HIF-1α participates in the hypoxic induction of AQP1. However. we also demonstrate that the activation of Aqp1 promoter by hypoxia is complex and multifactorial and suggest that besides HIF-1α other transcription factors might contribute to this regulatory process.

Thus. plants have evolved mechanisms for down-regulation which safely dissipate excess solar energy. The most important of these processes. the ones that lead to non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of antenna excitons. are triggered by acidification of the lumen via ApH changes that are a part of light-driven transthylakoid proton motive force (pmf).

Monoclonal plasma cells often secrete high amounts of immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) that could induce tissue damage. Recently we showed that FLCs are internalized in endothelial and myocardial cell lines and secreted in extracellular vesicles (EVs). MM serum derived EVs presented phenotypic differences if compared with Monoclonal gammophaty of undetermined significance (MGUS) serum derived EVs suggesting their involvement in MM pathogenesis or progression. To investigate the effect of circulating EVs on endothelial and myocardial cells we purified MM and MGUS serum derived EVs with differential ultracentrifugation protocols and tested their biological activity. We found that MM and MGUS EVs induced different proliferation and internalization rates in endothelial and myocardial cells. thus we tried to find specific targets in MM EVs docking and processing. Pre-treatment of EVs with anti FLCs antibodies or heparin blocked the MM EVs uptake highlighting that FLCs and Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are involved. Indeed only MM EVs exposure induced a strong NfkB nuclear translocation that was completely abolished after anti FLCs antibodies and heparin pre-treatment. The protein tyrosin kinase c-src is present on MM circulating EVs and redistributes to the cell plasma membrane after MM EVs exposure.

Depletion of Grx3/4 specifically impaired all iron-requiring reactions in the cytosol. mitochondria. and nucleus. including the synthesis of Fe/S clusters. heme. and di-iron centers. These defects were caused by impairment of iron insertion into proteins and iron transfer to mitochondria. indicating that intracellular iron is not bioavailable. despite highly elevated cytosolic levels.

1026311,ER stress. autophagy. and RNA viruses,2014,Jia-Rong Jheng and Jin-Yuan Ho and Jim-Tong Horng,5,,,388,Frontiers,Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a general term for representing the pathway by which various stimuli affect ER functions. ER stress induces the evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways. called the unfolded protein response (UPR). which compromises the stimulus and then determines whether the cell survives or dies. In recent years. ongoing research has suggested that these pathways may be linked to the autophagic response. which plays a key role in the cell’s response to various stressors. Autophagy performs a self-digestion function. and its activation protects cells against certain pathogens. However. the link between the UPR and autophagy may be more complicated. These two systems may act dependently. or the induction of one system may interfere with the other. Experimental studies have found that different viruses modulate these mechanisms to allow them to escape the host immune response or. worse. to exploit the host’s defense to their advantage; thus. this topic is a critical area in antiviral research. In this review. we summarize the current knowledge about how RNA viruses. including influenza virus. poliovirus. coxsackievirus. enterovirus 71.

However. the mechanisms utilized by enterovirus 71 (EV71) to mediate anti-apoptotic activity remained undetermined. We observed that EV71 infection induced an early activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. The activity of GSK3β. a downstream target of these pathways. was negatively regulated by the activation of both MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. The phosphorylation of GSK3 could be inhibited by treatment with the specific inhibitors of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. Other Akt downstream targets.

More recently. a swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus that is spreading via human-to-human transmission has become a serious public concern. Although vaccination is the primary strategy for preventing infections. influenza antiviral drugs play an important role in a comprehensive approach to controlling illness and transmission. In addition. a search for influenza-inhibiting drugs is particularly important in the face of high rate of emergence of influenza strains resistant to several existing influenza antivirals. We searched for novel anti-influenza inhibitors using a cell-based neutralization (inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect) assay.

Because synaptic vesicles have a distinct protein composition. the AP3 complex should selectively recognize some or all of the synaptic vesicle proteins. Here we show that one element of this recognition process is the v-SNARE. VAMP-2. because tetanus toxin. which cleaves VAMP-2. inhibited the formation of synaptic vesicles and their coating with AP3 in vitro. Mutant tetanus toxin and botulinum toxins. which cleave t-SNAREs. did not inhibit synaptic vesicle production. AP3-containing complexes isolated from coated vesicles could be immunoprecipitated by a VAMP-2 antibody.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal Ca2+ depletion results in STIM1 redistribution from ER membrane homogeneity to distinctly localized aggregates near the plasma membrane; these changes precede and are linked to cytoplasmic Ca2+ influx via Ca2+ release-activated channels (CRACs). The molecular mechanisms initiating ER STIM1 redistribution and plasma membrane CRAC activity are not well understood. We recombinantly expressed the Ca2+-sensing region of STIM1 consisting of the EF-hand together with the sterile α-motif (SAM) domain (EF-SAM) to investigate its Ca2+-related conformational and biochemical features.

1026421,Functional domains and motifs of bacterial type III effector proteins and their roles in infection,2011,Paul Dean,35,,6,1100-1125,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,A key feature of the virulence of many bacterial pathogens is the ability to deliver effector proteins into eukaryotic cells via a dedicated type three secretion system (T3SS). Many bacterial pathogens. including species of Chlamydia. Xanthomonas. Pseudomonas. Ralstonia. Shigella. Salmonella. Escherichia and Yersinia. depend on the T3SS to cause disease. T3SS effectors constitute a large and diverse group of virulence proteins that mimic eukaryotic proteins in structure and function. A salient feature of bacterial effectors is their modular architecture. comprising domains or motifs that confer an array of subversive functions within the eukaryotic cell. These domains/motifs therefore represent a fascinating repertoire of molecular determinants with important roles during infection. This review provides a snapshot of our current understanding of bacterial effector domains and motifs where a defined role in infection …,True,P7f0Vt0AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,277,https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article-abstract/35/6/1100/524381,14603785422394809378,/scholar?cites=14603785422394809378,,https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/35/6/1100/524381,0,0,0

The best-described EPEC effectors are encoded together on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island and display high levels of multifunctionality and cooperativity within the host cell. More recently. effectors encoded outside the LEE (non-LEE effectors) have been discovered and their functions are beginning to be uncovered. The recent completion of the EPEC genome sequence suggests its effector repertoire consists of at least 21 effector proteins. Here. we describe the genomic location of effectors and discuss recent advances made on effector cellular function as well as their role in the infection process.,True,P7f0Vt0AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,232,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527408001847,5502545534134112262,/scholar?cites=5502545534134112262,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527408001847,0,0,0

Thus. the Map (Mitochondria‐associated protein) effector is shown to: (i) be as essential as EspF for disrupting intestinal barrier function. (ii) be able to function independently of EspF. (iii) alter tight junction structure and (iv) mediate these effects in the absence of mitochondrial targeting. Additionally. the outer membrane protein Intimin is shown to be crucial for EspF and Map to disrupt the intestinal barrier function.

Sialidase activity in vaginal fluids is diagnostic of BV and sialic acid-rich components of mucus have protective and immunological roles. However. whereas mucus degradation is believed to be important in the etiology and complications associated with BV. the role(s) of sialidases and the participation of individual bacterial species in the degradation of mucus barriers in BV have not been investigated. Here we demonstrate that the BV-associated bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis uses sialidase to break down and deplete sialic acid-containing mucus components in the vagina.

BV is a common vaginal condition in women and is associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. Gardnerella vaginalis is one of the most frequently isolated bacterial species in BV. However. there has been much debate in the literature concerning the contribution of G. vaginalis to the etiology of BV. since it is also present in a significant proportion of healthy women. Here we present a new murine vaginal infection model with a clinical isolate of G. vaginalis. Our data demonstrate that this model displays key features used clinically to diagnose BV. including the presence of sialidase activity and exfoliated epithelial cells with adherent bacteria (reminiscent of clue cells). G. vaginalis was capable of ascending uterine infection. which correlated with the degree of vaginal infection and level of vaginal sialidase activity. The host response to G. vaginalis infection was characterized by robust vaginal epithelial cell exfoliation in the absence of histological inflammation. Our analyses of clinical specimens from women with BV revealed a measureable epithelial exfoliation response compared to women with normal flora. a phenotype that. to our knowledge. is measured here for the first time. The results of this study demonstrate that G. vaginalis is sufficient to cause BV phenotypes and suggest that this organism may contribute to BV etiology and associated complications.

METHODS AND RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that changes in the activity of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are responsible for the damage to connective tissue in these lesions. histochemical studies of the immunoreactivity (IR) for MMPs and their tissue TIMPs (MMP-1. MMP-2. MMP-3. MMP-9. TIMP-1. and TIMP-2) were made in TAAs (n= 7) and aortic valves (n= 5) from 7 patients with Marfan's syndrome. All TAAs showed cystic medial necrosis (CMN). with loss of elastic fibers and smooth muscle cells. Extensive areas of myxoid change were found in all aortic valves. Areas of CMN showed no IR for any MMPs or TIMPs. The IR of smooth muscle cells at the borders of areas of CMN was stronger for all MMPs. especially MMP-2 and MMP-9. than in other regions. The surfaces of disrupted elastic fibers showed IR for MMP-2 and MMP-9. Areas of myxoid change showed similar but less pronounced alterations. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the defect in fibrillin-1 in Marfan's syndrome leads to (1) formation of elastin that is abnormally aggregated and more easily degraded by MMPs than is normal elastin.(2) upregulation of the synthesis of MMPs.(3) progressive destruction of connective tissue by these enzymes. and (4) development of TAAs and valvular lesions.,True,V7lO13UAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,275,https://europepmc.org/article/med/9852923,4053260263950648785,/scholar?cites=4053260263950648785,,,0,0,0

We investigated levels of development. problem behavior. and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in a population sample of Dutch eight-year-old children with DS. Developmental outcomes were compared with normative data of eight-year-old children from the general population.   Method Over a three-year-period all parents with an eight-year-old child with DS were approached by the national parent organization. Developmental skills were assessed by means of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Ability. To measure emotional and behavioral problems we used the Child Behavior Checklist. HRQoL was assessed with the TNO-AZL Children's Quality of Life questionnaire. Analyses of variance were applied to compare groups.   Results A total of 337 children participated. Mean developmental age was substantially lower than mean calendar age (3.9 years. SD 0.87 and 8.1 years. SD 0.15 respectively). Mean developmental age was significantly lower among boys than girls (3.6 (SD 0.85) and 4.2 years (SD 0.82) respectively; p<0.001).

Identifying the most sensitive age interval(s) for adult overweight is relevant for primary prevention. The aim of the study was to assess the relative contribution of body mass index (BMI) changes between 0 and 18 years to adult overweight. and to identify the earliest critical growth period.  Methods and Findings Data from 762 subjects in the Terneuzen Birth Cohort with an average of 21 growth measurements per subject from birth until 18 years were used. The main outcome measure was the BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at young adulthood. For each subject BMI SDS was fitted by a piecewise linear model at eight different ages and correlated to adult BMI SDS. The age intervals in between are considered critical according to three criteria. tested by respectively Students' t-tests. multiple linear regression analyses and Pearson's correlation tests. In the age intervals 4 months(m) -1 year(y). 2–6 y. 6–10 y and 10–18 y the BMI SDS change differs between adults with and without overweight (P≤0.001). The age intervals 2–6 y and 10–18 y also meet the second criterion. implying that the BMI change during this period has a predictive value for adult BMI SDS in addition to BMI SDS at the end of the period. The largest rise in correlation between estimated BMI SDS and measured adult BMI SDS occurs during the period 2–6 y (from 0.36 to 0.63). which results in a high sensitivity (0.6) and specificity (0.8) by the age of 6 y.

Although effective ways of promoting smoking cessation during pregnancy exist. the impact of these interventions has not been studied at a national level. We estimated the prevalence of smoking throughout pregnancy in the Netherlands and quantified associations of maternal smoking throughout pregnancy with socioeconomic. behavioural. and neonatal risk factors for infant health and development.  Methodology/Principal Findings Data of five national surveys. containing records of 14.553 Dutch mothers and their offspring were analyzed. From 2001 to 2007. the overall rate of smoking throughout pregnancy fell by 42% (from 13.2% to 7.6%) mainly as a result of a decrease among highly educated women. In the lowest-educated group. the overall rate of smoking throughout pregnancy was six times as high as in the highest-educated group (18.7% versus 3.2%). Prenatal tobacco smoke exposure was associated with increased risk of extremely preterm (≤28 completed weeks) (OR 7.25; 95% CI 3.40 to 15.38) and small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants (OR 3.08; 95% CI 2.66 to 3.57).

The fidelity with which mRNA is translated during protein synthesis is determined by two factors: the availability of aminoacyl-tRNAs composed of cognate amino acid:tRNA pairs and the accurate selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs on the ribosome. The role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in translation is to define the genetic code by accurately pairing cognate tRNAs with their corresponding amino acids. Synthetases achieve the amino acid substrate specificity necessary to keep errors in translation to an acceptable level in two ways: preferential binding of the cognate amino acid and selective editing of near-cognate amino acids.

Errors during amino acid selection are usually corrected by the editing activity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases such as phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS). which edit misactivated tyrosine. Comparison of cytosolic and mitochondrial PheRS from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggested that the organellar protein might lack the editing activity. Yeast cytosolic PheRS was found to contain an editing site. which upon disruption abolished both cis and trans editing of Tyr-tRNAPhe.

The accurate coupling of cognate amino acids and tRNAs by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is achieved through a combination of substrate specificity and product editing. Once released by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. both cognate and near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs were considered to be committed to ribosomal protein synthesis through their association with EF-Tu. Here we show instead that aminoacyl-tRNAs in ternary complex with EF-Tu•GTP can readily dissociate and rebind to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. For mischarged species. this allows resampling by the product editing pathway. leading to a reduction in the overall error rate of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis.

1026516,Mechanism of tRNA-dependent editing in translational quality control,2007,Jiqiang Ling and Hervé Roy and Michael Ibba,104,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,1,72,National Acad Sciences,Protein synthesis requires the pairing of amino acids with tRNAs catalyzed by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The synthetases are highly specific. but errors in amino acid selection are occasionally made. opening the door to inaccurate translation of the genetic code. The fidelity of protein synthesis is maintained by the editing activities of synthetases. which remove noncognate amino acids from tRNAs before they are delivered to the ribosome. Although editing has been described in numerous synthetases. the reaction mechanism is unknown. To define the mechanism of editing. phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase was used to investigate different models for hydrolysis of the noncognate product Tyr-tRNAPhe. Deprotonation of a water molecule by the highly conserved residue βHis-265. as proposed for threonyl-tRNA synthetase. was excluded because replacement of this and neighboring residues had little effect on …,True,NvtUMaYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,88,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/1/72.short,11603893877077001164,/scholar?cites=11603893877077001164,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/104/1/72.full.pdf,0,0,0

The fidelity of translation is mainly determined by two events: synthesis of cognate amino acid:tRNA pairs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) and accurate selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) by the ribosome. To ensure faithful aa-tRNA synthesis. many aaRSs employ a proofreading (“editing”) activity. such as phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) that hydrolyze mischarged Tyr-tRNAPhe. Eukaryotes maintain two distinct PheRS enzymes. a cytoplasmic (ctPheRS) and an organellar form. CtPheRS is similar to bacterial enzymes in that it consists of a heterotetramer in which the α-subunits contain the active site and the β-subunits harbor the editing site.
