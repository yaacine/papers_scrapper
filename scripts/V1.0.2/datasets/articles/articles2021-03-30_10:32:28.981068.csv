The structure of the dimer has been determined by X-ray crystallography and reveals a dihedral angle of 73° between the two tatpp units. which is likely due lone pair repulsion on the adjacent aza nitrogens on each tatpp unit. Because of this non-planar geometry. this ditatpp dimer is freely soluble in organic solvents. such as ethanol. very much unlike the tatpp ligand. which is sparingly soluble in all common solvents. Photolysis of ditatpp with visible light in the presence of sacrificial donors. such as triethylamine. results in multi-electron reduction on each of the tatpp units. as determined by absorption spectroscopy. As the tatpp units appear to function independently of one another. and …,True,rj_1bi0AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020169316303358,6144578238959057516,/scholar?cites=6144578238959057516,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0020169316303358,0,0,0

The cobalt(II)‐bis‐tpy complex can exhibit selective “naked eye” colorimetric detection of micromolar level cyanide in aqueous solution. where the visible red‐orange color of cobalt(II)‐bis‐tpy complex solution (aqueous) disappears in the presence of cyanide ions. In order to make the sensor more proficient and easy to use. these cobalt(II)‐bis‐tpy molecules are chemically grafted on the surface of microcrystalline cellulose and cellulose paper. which turns the color of functionalized cellulose orange‐red. Both of these colored cellulose powder and paper exhibit color loss in 10−6m aqueous solution of potassium cyanide.

The detonation failure diameter of a bare DNAN charge is greater than 100 mm and about 44 mm with 1.5 mm steel confinement. Comparative studies of two sets of formulations were carried out. The first set comprised formulations containing 60% of NTO. FOX-7. HMX or RDX and 40% of DNAN or TNT. The second set comprised formulations containing 30% of NTO. FOX-7. TATB or RDX and 70% of DNAN or TNT. The studies were mainly concentrated on characterization of the formulations. which included determination of the sensitivity parameters and the velocity of detonation (VOD). The study confirmed that DNAN and DNAN-based formulations are relatively insensitive compared to TNT and the analogous TNT-based formulations respectively. The rate of the detonation reaction of DNAN is enhanced in the presence of the high energy ingredients RDX. HMX. FOX-7 and NTO to varying degrees. The VODs of the FOX-7/TNT and RDX/TNT formulations match closely with the proportions of FOX-7 and RDX under study. The VOD and shock sensitivity of the FOX-7/DNAN formulations decrease rapidly compared to the RDX/DNAN formulations. with increases in the proportion of FOX-7 or RDX.

The purpose of this research was to study the effect of gamma irradiation on the mahkota dewa leaves which has been claimed to contain potent anticancer substances. Maceration of dried mahkota dewa leaves successively with n-hexane. ethyl acetate. and ethanol gave crude extracts which the ethyl acetate was the most cytotoxic extract against leukemia L1210 cells with an inhibition concentration fifty (IC 50) value of 10.3 µg/ml. Further separation of ethyl acetate extract by column chromatograph gave 7 fractions. and fraction 2 showed the most cytotoxic fraction exhibited the most cytotoxic extract against leukemia L1210 cells with an IC 50 value of 1.9 µg/ml. Since. the fraction 2 of ethyl acetate extract was the most potent fraction. the irradiated samples were treated with the same procedure as treatment of fraction 2 from control sample. Cytotoxic activity test of fractions 2 from irradiated samples showed that the cytotoxic activity decreased depending on increasing of irradiation dose. Gamma irradiation dose up to 7.5 kGy on mahkota dewa leaves could decreased the cytotoxic activity of fraction 2 as the most cytotoxic-potential fraction against leukemia L1210 cells. but decreasing the cytotoxic activity has not exceeded the limit of the fraction declared inactive.

The in–vitro degradation study in synthetic body fluid (SBF) of the irradiated membrane has been analyzed during periods of 6 months by means of weight loss. mechanical properties and scanning electron microscopy observation compared to that the un-irradiated one. The result showed that weight loss of irradiated membrane with 25 kGy and 50 kGy and immersed in SBF solution for 6 months reached 18% and 25% respectively. While un-irradiated membrane did not give significant weight loss. Tensile strength of membranes decreases with increasing of irradiation dose and further decreases in tensile strength is observed when irradiated membrane was followed by immersion in SBF solution.

Herein. we develop a label-free DNA sensor based on DNA–Ag NCs and exonuclease III (Exo III)-catalyzed target recycling amplification. The fluorescence of single-strand DNA-stabilized Ag NCs can be enhanced through hybridization with the guanine-rich DNA. With the addition of target DNA. the fluorescence intensity decreases comparable with that of DNA duplex-stabilized Ag NCs. which is attributed to the competitive hybridization reaction. With the addition of Exo III. the fluorescence intensity decreases more obviously. The calibration range for target DNA is 0.3 to 30 nM. and the detection limit is 0.2 nM.

Of particular relevance. the low luminescence efficiency of Ln-based nanoparticles is one of the main factors that limits their further applications. Carbon. which is present on the surface of all TiO2 photocatalysts. can be responsible for luminescence quenching processes and. thus. decreasing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. This article presents a systematic experimental and theoretical study of the effects of carbon on the photocatalytic performance of Ho3+-modified TiO2.

Herein. density functional theory (DFT) simulations revealed that the formation of a thermodynamically stable AgInS2(112)/Bi2WO6(010) heterojunction could promote charge separation and enhance the photoactivity of Bi2WO6. To confirm these theoretical predictions. a new type of photocatalysts in the form of Bi2WO6 flower-like microspheres decorated with different amounts of AgInS2 quantum dots (QDs) was obtained using a three-step procedure. The optimized system. obtained by embedding 1 wt% AgInS2 QDs on a Bi2WO6 matrix. possessed an enhanced photocatalytic activity for both phenol degradation and water splitting under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). as well as good reusability and stability during prolonged storage.

It acts as a critical focal point for whole body and cellular mechanisms maintaining energy homeostasis by regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. food intake. gene transcription. and protein synthesis. The AMPK β subunit contains a glycogen-binding domain that has been shown to associate with glycogen particles in vitro and glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase in cultured cells. To determine whether AMPK associates with glycogen particles in vivo. we developed a procedure to purify glycogen α-particles to apparent homogeneity from rat liver. Using immunoreactivity and mass spectrometry we determined that AMPK does not associate with the glycogen particle in livers from random-fed rats.

The zeolite HY (Si/Al ratio 3.1) was the most efficient catalyst. leading to the highest yield of methyl β-galactofuranoside. isolated as its acetylated or isopropylidene derivatives. indicating that with large pore zeolites. the reaction efficiency depends upon the concentration of the zeolite acid sites and its hydrophilicity. However. the best regioselectivity for β-galactofuranoside versus β-galactopyranoside was obtained with the medium pore zeolite HZSM-5. which also led to the lowest starting material conversion. suggesting that both the zeolite pore size and topology are determinant for the obtained results.

Thus. it is important to find alternatives such as finding excipients that increase drug solubility. Ionic liquids (ILs). particularly choline-based ILs. have been studied as solubility enhancers in drug delivery systems. Nonetheless. to acknowledge this property as a functionality. it needs to be proven at non-toxic concentrations. Hence. herein two choline-amino acid ILs were studied as functional excipients by evaluating their influence on the solubility of the poorly water-soluble ferulic acid and rutin. while considering their safety. The solubility of the drugs was always higher in the presence of the ILs than in water. Ionic liquids did not affect the radical scavenging activity of the drugs or the cell viability. Moreover. stable oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions were prepared containing each drug and the ILs. allowing a significantly higher drug loading. Globally. our results suggest that choline-based ILs may act as green functional excipients. since at non-toxic concentrations they considerably improve drug solubility/loading. without influencing the antioxidant activity of the drugs. the cell viability. or the stability of the formulations.

Identifying novel and more effective therapies. while minimizing toxicity. continues to be fundamental in curtailing RCC. Rutin. a bioflavonoid widely found in nature. has shown promising anticancer properties. but with limited applicability due to its poor water solubility and pharmacokinetics. Thus. the potential anticancer effects of rutin toward a human renal cancer cell line (786-O). while considering its safety in Vero kidney cells. was assessed. as well as the applicability of ionic liquids (ILs) to improve drug delivery. Rutin (up to 50 µM) did not show relevant cytotoxic effects in Vero cells. However. in 786-O cells. a significant decrease in cell viability was already observed at 50 µM. Moreover. exposure to rutin caused a significant increase in the sub-G1 population of 786-O cells. reinforcing the possible anticancer activity of this biomolecule. Two choline-amino acid ILs. at non-toxic concentrations. enhanced rutin’s solubility/loading while allowing the maintenance of rutin’s anticancer effects.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of IL-polymer nanoparticle hybrid systems as tools to deliver poorly soluble drugs. These systems were obtained using a methodology previously developed by our group and improved herein to produce IL-polymer nanoparticle hybrid systems. Two different choline-based ILs and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)(PLGA) 50: 50 or PLGA 75: 25 were used to load rutin into the delivery system. The resulting rutin-loaded IL-polymer nanoparticle hybrid systems presented a diameter of 250–300 nm. with a low polydispersity index and a zeta potential of about− 40 mV. The drug association efficiency ranged from 51% to 76%. which represents a good achievement considering the poor solubility of rutin. No significant particle aggregation was obtained upon freeze-drying. The presence of the IL in the nanosystem does not affect its sustained release properties. achieving about 85% of rutin released after 72 h.

The heavy cut is taken from one of the end-cuts of the vacuum distillation column of Tehran refinery which is normally fed into Isomax unit (a catalytic cracking process) called Isofeed. The consortia for this study were prepared from the petroleum-contaminated sludge and soils from Abadan. Shiraz. Isfahan and Tehran petroleum refineries of Iran. Nine microbial samples were collected (A. B. C. and I) and examined. Microorganisms were cultivated in an anaerobic medium to which Isofeed from Tehran refinery was added under anaerobic conditions. After twice sub-culturing the samples. the oil was separated from the liquid and examined to identify its bioconversion extent. For this purpose. a column chromatograph method was used to separate saturates. aromatics and resins content of the oil. The results demonstrate that consortia A and C were able to increase the saturated and aromatics fractions of the oil and reduce the resins content of the oil. The saturated fractions of the bio-treated oil were also analyzed by a GC-MS analytical instrument. The GC-MS results revealed that the amount of normal chain hydrocarbons is reduced and the branched and cyclic hydrocarbons are increased.,True,XRggzDEAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,3,https://www.sid.ir/en/Journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=170111,8118319110608082243,/scholar?cites=8118319110608082243,,https://www.sid.ir/EN/VEWSSID/J_pdf/102420090104.pdf,0,0,0

In this regards. biosynthesis is well adopted as a viable method for producing benign nanoparticles for biomedical application. The present study aimed at optimization and study of the effects of external stimuli pH and gold ion concentration on the morphology of biosynthesized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) using Fusarium oxysporum. Based on the central composite design. the experimental method was developed at three levels of the operating parameters; the initial gold ion concentration. cell mass. and pH. The X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy showed that the obtained GNPs were impurity-free while the size and shape of particles were a function of the pH and Au3+ concentration. Also. analysis of variance revealed that the cell mass and initial gold ion concentration have a significant effect on biosynthesis of GNPs. The optimal condition was found at the initial gold ion concentration of 550 µM. pH 3.5. and cell mass of 0.047 mg/mL with the obtained gold uptake of 98.29%. Pseudo-second order kinetics model best fitted the experimental results with the activation energy of 73.8 kJ indicating that complex chemisorption is the mechanism of gold biorecovery.

In the early stage of oxygen exposure. oxygen chemisorption induces a p (2× 3) surface reconstruction of the missing row type on Mo (112).

1213588,Development of the first and second-generation Silyl-Heck reactions,2015,Jesse Ryan McAtee,,,,,,Allyl and vinylsilanes are important nucleophiles in organic synthesis. They are stable reagents that can participate in a variety of transformations including mainly Hosomi-Sakurai crotylations. Hiyama-Denmark crosscouplings. Tamao-Fleming oxidations. and fluorination reactions. Prior to this work there were few methods that allowed for the synthesis of these valuable compounds from simple alkenes. Using transition metal catalysis. I sought to develop a method to access unsaturated organosilanes using a reaction analogous to the Heck reaction. This endeavor proved valuable. as a powerful new method was developed that allows for the synthesis of vinylsilanes from styrenes and related molecules. and the synthesis of allylsilanes from simple α-olefins containing allylic hydrogen atoms. The latter reaction is highly selective for the linear E-allylsilane. This thesis describes the initial discovery and optimization of the silyl- Heck reaction using palladium catalysis. Methods were developed for use of silyl iodides or silyl chlorides with lithium iodide additives as coupling reagents. The design and synthesis of second-generation ligands have allowed for the synthesis of allylsilanes in high yield by overcoming alkene isomerization. With these ligands I have identified a simplified method to prepare vinyl and allylsilanes.

Steady-state kinetics indicate that amine-reduced CuAGAO is reoxidized by O2 >103 times faster than the CoAGAO analogue.

These results are consistent with H• tunneling. transitioning from a reversible to an irreversible regime. The limiting deuterium KIEs increase from ∼30 to 120 as the fatty acid chain is shortened from that of the native substrate. In addition. activation barriers increase in a manner that reflects decreased fatty acid binding affinities.

A significant change in the characteristic dark green color of IR-786 in MeCN to yellow was observed as a result of nucleophilic addition of CN− to the fluorophore. ie. formation of IR 786-(CN). which was also verified by a blue shift in the 775 nm absorbance peak to 430 nm. A distinct green fluorescence emission from the IR-786-(CN) in MeCN was also observed. which demonstrated the selectivity of IR-786 towards CN− in MeCN. Fluorescence emission studies of IR-786 showed that the lower detection limit and the sensitivity of IR-786 for CN− in MeCN was 0.5 μM and 0.5 to 8 μM. respectively. The potential use of IR-786 as a solvent-free solid state sensor for the selective sensing and monitoring of CN− in the environment was also demonstrated. On solvent-free solid state surfaces. the sensitivity of the IR-786 to CN− in water samples was in the range of 50–300 μM with minimal interference by OH−.

Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal domain of ARID4A is an unusual interdigitated double Tudor domain with DNA-binding activity. However. how the Tudor domain of ARID4B differs from that of ARID4A remains unknown. Here. we found that the ARID4B Tudor domain has significantly weaker DNA affinity than the ARID4A Tudor domain despite sharing more than 80% sequence identity. Structure determination and DNA titration analysis indicated that the ARID4B Tudor domain is also an interdigitated double Tudor domain with a DNA-binding surface similar to ARID4A. We identified that a residue close to the DNA-binding site of the Tudor domain differs between ARID4A and ARID4B.

In this paper. significant differences between the interaction of p53 with Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL were demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Bcl-xL was found to bind strongly to the p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD) with a dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼600 nM. whereas Mcl-1 binds to the p53 DBD weakly with a dissociation constant in the mM range. In contrast. the p53 transactivation domain (TAD) binds weakly to Bcl-xL with a Kd ∼ 300−500 μM and strongly to Mcl-1 with a Kd ∼ 10−20 μM.

Protein SSO6904 is an all-helices protein. Protein purification by gel filtration discovered both monomer and dimer forms of SSO6904. 1H NMR spectra indicated that the monomer and dimer have similar structural core. Analysis of 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra revealed that the major structural difference between the monomer and dimer was at the two loops connecting helices 2 and 3. and helices 5 and 6. respectively. These two loops form a key structural region for constructing the dimer. while other regions of monomer and dimer have the same structures. Structural analysis proposed a domain-swapped model of the SSO6904 dimer.

This process is mediated by viral fusion proteins. In class I fusion proteins. there are two membrane-associated regions. an N-terminal fusion peptide (FP) and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). Between these two domains are varying lengths of two water-soluble coiled-coil regions (Fig. 1a). During virus-cell membrane fusion. the fusion protein experiences an irreversible conformational change wherein the two coiled coils bend into a hairpin. forming a six-helix bundle in the final state. which presumably brings FP and TMD into proximity in the merged membrane. However. while the crystal structures of the water-soluble domains of a number of viral fusion proteins have been determined in the pre-and post-fusion states. the structures of the membrane-bound FP and TMD domains are still poorly understood …,True,7BYgbUEAAAAJ:-uzm3Y7AvW0C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4986104941370068542&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The results from this study place focus on the importance of learners' prior learning (previous experiences) and the need to develop a coherent framework of formal teaching models for the nature of matter and phase change.,True,A7_-vJ0AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:505632,,,,,0,0,0

1213721,Mechanism of Copper Catalyzed Diazo Coupling and its Applications & Reactions of Multiynes,2015,Phani Raja P Mamidipalli,,,,,,This thesis has two main parts. Part I is composed of two chapters which describes mechanistic investigation of copper catalyzed reactions of diazo compounds followed by their applications in click chemistry. Part II consists of three chapters describing new methods for the generation of functionalized arenes from multiynes via transition metal catalyzed reactions. Chapter 1 consists of the mechanistic study of copper catalyzed reaction of diazo compounds with terminal alkynes. In this work. with the help of kinetic preference of the catalyst. crossover experiments data and hammett plots. we gathered substantial evidence for the copper acetylide mechanism over the Cu-carbenoid-mediated C–H insertion mechanism for the reaction between terminal alkyne and diazo compounds with CuI. Chapter 2 describes a novel three component coupling reaction for the preparation of 1.4.5-trisubstituted-1.2.3-triazoles by in-situ trapping of 5-copper-1.2.3-triazole intermediate with diazo compounds. Selected examples are highlighted to demonstrate the scope of the reaction along with the electronic effects of the alkyne and azides on the three component coupling reaction. This methodology is further extended for the preparation of fused triazole motifs in a single step. In part II. chapter 3 discuss a brief survey in the recent developments of HDDA based aryne chemistry and its applications. Chapter 4 discloses an unprecedented dual reactivity of C–H bonds on the -carbon of the silyl group in the aryne intermediates.

1213780,Ten simple rules to commercialize scientific research,2012,Anthony C Fletcher and Philip E Bourne,8,PLoS Comput Biol,9,e1002712,Public Library of Science,Commercializing scientific research or a breakthrough idea is really no different. in principle. from commercializing anything. except perhaps that it’s more difficult in practice because of the steps required to turn basic research into something practical and because you are looking for a market for a product. rather than designing a product to fit an established. or obvious market.Commercialization is different to starting and running a company. a broader endeavour and the subject of a previous Ten Simple Rules article [1]. Even so. commercialization can be a broad endeavour. For example. at one extreme. you could hand over your monoclonal antibody to Sigma to supply it on your behalf to other researchers who might find it useful while the company pays you a small royalty; on the other. you could be involved in developing Herceptin (anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody) from its origins as a mouse-specific antibody through to its use as an effective antibreast cancer drug. in a process that took more than decade.

1213783,Ten simple rules to protect your intellectual property,2012,Mark Jolly and Anthony C Fletcher and Philip E Bourne,8,PLoS Comput Biol,11,e1002766,Public Library of Science,The concepts that underpin the protection of ideas and inventions are not new; such laws have been around for several hundred years and are discussed under the broad heading of intellectual property (IP). IP is easily misunderstood. but at the same time most scientists encounter it at some point in their career. as it is a necessary feature in the commercialization of research. The term intellectual property includes such concepts and rights as copyright. trademarks. industrial design rights. and patents. It is important to remember that IP is a tool to help your endeavours. and not a goal in itself. Having IP for its own sake is pointless. IP can be crucial in commercializing research and running a successful science-based business. but having a patent and having a successful patented product are two very different things. Above all. IP can only work for you if you understand what it is. why you want it. and what you are going to do with it. These ten simple rules are intended to provide an overview of these issues; however. we must start with a warning. Laws relating to IP change all the time. they are complex. sometimes rather obscure. and are very different from country to country. For example. research surrounding methods of treatment by surgery and therapy and diagnostic methods are patentable in the United States. but specifically excluded from patentability in Europe [1]. However. these boundaries seem to be shifting in both the US and Europe. In short. we are dealing with a complex and changing subject and restrict ourselves here to the guiding principles.,True,p2cv_WYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,10,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002766,11742199253581281058,/scholar?cites=11742199253581281058,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002766,0,0,0
1213784,Ten quick tips for using a Raspberry Pi,2019,Anthony C Fletcher and Cameron Mura,15,PLoS computational biology,5,e1006959,Public Library of Science,Much of biology (and. indeed. all of science) is becoming increasingly computational. We tend to think of this in regard to algorithmic approaches and software tools. as well as increased computing power. There has also been a shift towards slicker. packaged solutions—which mirrors everyday life. from smart phones to smart homes. As a result. it’s all too easy to be detached from the fundamental elements that power these changes and to see solutions as ‘black boxes’. The major goal of this piece is to use the example of the Raspberry Pi. a small. general-purpose computer. as the central component in a highly developed ecosystem that brings together elements like external hardware. sensors and controllers. state-of-the-art programming practices. and basic electronics and physics. all in an approachable and useful way. External devices and inputs are easily connected to the Pi. and it can in turn control attached devices very simply. So. whether you want to use it to manage laboratory equipment. sense and sample the environment. teach bioinformatics. control your home security. or make a model lunar lander. it’s all built from the same basic principles.

1213788,Ten simple rules for starting a company,2012,Anthony C Fletcher and Philip E Bourne,8,PLoS Comput Biol,3,e1002439,Public Library of Science,Many faculty. staff. and students at academic institutions think about starting companies at some point in their careers. As academic funding models change. and how academia views entrepreneurial activity changes. starting companies is likely to happen more frequently. Hence. it is worth considering Ten Simple Rules to contemplate when starting a company while in academia. There is a wealth of general information out there to help you. but that information is not aimed specifically towards computational biologists. What follows is a hybrid that is intended as a general quick review for anyone. intermingled with some specific advice for computational biologists. By way of experience. we should say we have been involved in starting several companies: both in the biomedical sciences. dealing with biological software. computational biology services. and currently SciVee Inc.(http://www. scivee. tv) distributing scientific rich media. and outside it. ranging from the distribution of independent films. to a socially oriented dining club aimed at supporting local businesses. to a business supplying art quality photographic prints. None have been a great financial success. but all have been immense fun. an opportunity to meet interesting people. and an opportunity to think quite differently than when doing scientific research.

The “pet birds” are the wild or exoticbirds having high genetic value and are housed under captivity as companions or for ornamental purposes. The commonly housed pet birds are either passeriformes or psittaciformes. These birds are housed under conditions to meet standard requirements for welfare of pet birds. Besides the pet birds and human relationship. these birds are potential carriers or transmitters of several pathogens considered responsible for zoonotic diseases. The range of the zoonotic diseases consisted of bacterial. viral. parasitic and fungal diseases. The mode of transmission is also an important entity for understanding the spread mechanism of zoonotic diseases. The transmission and spread is predominantly through the direct contact and in the few conditions through the vectors; termed as vector-borne transmission. Altogether. in this chapter. the authors have discussed different aspects of welfare of pet birds. categories of zoonotic diseases along with mode of transmission and spread of zoonoses. At the last. few aspects of welfare of pet birds and prevention and control guidelines of zoonoses are suggested for the personal biosafety and public health.,True,iYOY0x8AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=UXeQDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA73&dq=info:WijNdyY-JnYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=NSCMVKZpyu&sig=Cp-zndsYaArS3bid6w6hK-XmroM,,,,https://www.intechopen.com/books/animal-welfare/welfare-of-pet-birds-and-potential-zoonoses,0,0,0

Despite this potential. there is little quantitative data on the effect of encapsulation in a well-defined compartment under varying conditions. To gain more insight into these effects. we have characterized two improved methods for the encapsulation of heterologous molecules inside bacteriophage MS2 viral capsids. First. attaching DNA oligomers to a molecule of interest and incubating it with MS2 coat protein dimers yielded reassembled capsids that packaged the tagged molecules. The addition of a protein-stabilizing osmolyte. trimethylamine-N-oxide. significantly increased the yields of reassembly. Second. we found that expressed proteins with genetically encoded negatively charged peptide tags could also induce capsid reassembly. resulting in high yields of …,True,f1Y1c2UAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,94,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn302183h,17679195173605409017,/scholar?cites=17679195173605409017,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479312/,0,0,0

It is difficult in practice. however. to establish and maintain the nanoscale distances that are required to maximize these effects. The type of metal. size. and shape of the nanoparticle. the physical distance separating the metal nanoparticle from the organic dye. and the spectral properties of the fluorophore itself are all proposed to influence the quantum yield and lifetime. This results in a complex behavior that can lead to either enhanced or quenched fluorescence in different contexts.

The canonical start codon (AUG) and a few near-cognates (GUG. UUG) are considered as the ‘start codons’ for translation initiation in Escherichia coli. Translation is typically not thought to initiate from the 61 remaining codons. Here. we quantified translation initiation of green fluorescent protein and nanoluciferase in E. coli from all 64 triplet codons and across a range of DNA copy number. We detected initiation of protein synthesis above measurement background for 47 codons. Translation from non-canonical start codons ranged from 0.007 to 3% relative to translation from AUG.

Detailed exploration of the reaction paths reveals in several cases the existence of a “capture‐like” transition state before the actual insertion. with free energies close to the insertion TS. Movement around these transition states does not just involve monomer and chain. but also clear distortion of the ligand skeleton to allow entry of the monomer. Taking these additional TSs into account leads to much improved agreement with experiment for a series of metallocenes and a constrained geometry catalyst system.

Ligand variation mainly affects the propagation rate. whereas chain transfer to the monomer is hardly affected by electronic factors. The results are analyzed in terms of the effects of ligand variation on the relative energies of “connected couples” of reactant local minima and the corresponding transition states on the basis of the Hammond postulate and the Curtin–Hammett principle.

In particular. the C 2-symmetric bis (indenyl) ansa-zirconocenes disclosed in the 1990s are complex to prepare. less stereo-and/or regioselective than ZNS. and lose performance at practical application temperatures. The golden era of these complexes. though. was before High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) could contribute significantly to their evolution. Herein. we illustrate a Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) model trained on a robust and highly accurate HTE database. The clear-box QSAR model utilizes. in particular. a limited number of chemically intuitive 3D geometric descriptors that screen various regions of space in and around the catalytic pocket in a modular way thus enabling to quantify individual substituent contributions. The main focus of the paper is on the methodology. which should be of rather broad applicability in molecular organometallic catalysis.

Herein we explore this process in two dipyrrin-based bichromophoric systems. One of these bisdipyrrins involved a pair of BODIPY chromophores linked by a single bond at their meso-positions (compound 1) and the other involved two dipyrrin ligands coordinated in a tetrahedral geometry at the Zn2+ ion (compound 2). Both compounds show rapid SBCT in polar solvents and only dipyrrin based emission in nonpolar solvents. the latter arising from a dipyrrin localized excited sate (LE). By “tuning” the solvent polarity the equilibrium between the LE and SBCT states can be shifted to favor either state.

A triplet energy (ET) higher than that of the chosen emitting dopant. appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels. good charge carrier transport. and high stability are all required. Here. computational methods were used to screen structures to find the most promising candidates for OLED hosts. The screening was carried out in three Tiers.

Indeed. it has been reported that boron difluoride dipyridylmethene (DIPYR) is non-emissive. and that derivatives of DIPYR have modest. if any. luminescence. We have studied a range of dipyridyl. diquinolyl and diisoquinolyl methene based dyes (Figure 1). These dyes absorb strongly in the blue-green part of the spectrum (λem= 450–520 nm. ε= 2.9–11 x 10 4 M-1 cm-1) and display green fluorescence with high quantum yields (ΦPL= up to 0.8). Key photophysical properties in these systems were evaluated using TD-DFT methods and compared to experiment. It was revealed though theoretical analysis and comparison with experiment that high quantum yields of the quinoline and isoquinoline derivatives are a result of the relative reordering of S1 and T2 state energies upon benzannulation of the parent structure. The intense absorption and high emission efficiency of the benzannulated derivatives make these compounds an intriguing class of dyes for further derivatization. I will discuss the dyes depicted in Figure 1 as well as range of other materials based on the dipyridyl-methene motif.A key limitation of Organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) are their low open circuit voltages (VOC). which are typically well below the energy of the light absorbed.

To understand the interactions between microorganisms in consortia. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy is used to follow the concentrations of various metabolites such as sugars (eg. glucose. maltose). longer chain carbohydrates. and ethanol to optimize consortia conditions for the production of ethanol. It is shown that with proper design A. oryzae can digest food waste simulants into soluble sugars that S. cerevisiae can ferment into ethanol. Depending on the substrate and conditions used. concentrations of 13% ethanol were achieved in 10 days. It is further shown that a direct alcohol fuel cell (FC) can be coupled with these A. oryzae-enabled S. cerevisiae fermentations using a reverse osmosis membrane. This “bio-hybrid FC” continually extracted ethanol from an ongoing consortium. enhancing ethanol production and allowing the bio-hybrid FC to run for at least one week. Obtained bio-hybrid FC currents were comparable to those from pure ethanol—water mixtures. using the same FC.

Arguably. the advent of the atomic force microscope AFM was instrumental in driving such efforts because. in principle. force profiles could be recovered directly. Nevertheless. it has taken years before techniques have developed enough as to recover the attractive part of the force with relatively low noise and without missing information on critical ranges. particularly under ambient conditions where capillary interactions are believed to dominate. Thus a systematic study of the different profiles that may arise in such situations is still lacking. Here we employ the surfaces of CaF 2. on which nanoscale water films form. to report on the range and force profiles that might originate by dynamic capillary interactions occurring between an AFM tip and nanoscale water patches. Three types of force profiles were observed under ambient conditions. One in which the force decay resembles the well-known inverse-square law typical of van der Waals interactions during the first 0.5–1 nm of decay. a second one in which the force decays almost linearly. in relatively good agreement with capillary force predicted by the constant chemical potential approximation. and a third one in which the attractive force is almost constant. ie. forms a plateau. up to 3–4 nm above the surface when the formation of a capillary neck dominates the tip–sample interaction.,True,XwUruU0AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,5,https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjnano/articles/6/84,473621338998246891,/scholar?cites=473621338998246891,,https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjnano/articles/6/84,0,0,0

We investigated the electrical transport in thin films of a phthalocyanine-based DLC in-dark and upon laser irradiation during long thermal cycles. Measuring the electrical transport between two electrodes we observed that in-dark the current is mostly due to doping levels while. upon laser irradiation. the photocurrent reflects the diffusion length of the photogenerated charge carriers and it is limited by the coherence length of a column.

Often there are little to no pharmacological and toxicological data available for new. illicitly used and abused opioids. and this has resulted in a growing number of serious adverse events. including death. The large influx of new synthetic opioids permeating the street-drug market. including fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. has generated the need for a fast and effective method to evaluate the risk a substance poses to public safety. In response. the US FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has developed a rapidly-deployable. multi-pronged computational approach to assess a drug’s risk to public health. A key component of this approach is a molecular docking model to predict the binding affinity of biologically uncharacterized fentanyl analogs to the mu opioid receptor. The model was validated by correlating the docking scores of structurally diverse opioids with experimentally determined binding affinities. Fentanyl derivatives with sub-nanomolar binding affinity at the mu receptor (e.g. carfentanil and lofentanil) have significantly lower binding scores. while less potent fentanyl derivatives have increased binding scores. The strong correlation between the binding scores and the experimental binding affinities suggests that this approach can be used to accurately predict the binding strength of newly identified fentanyl analogs at the mu receptor in the absence of in vitro data and may assist in the temporary scheduling of those substances that pose a risk to public safety.,True,Y-Gaw0AAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,31,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197734,9763757579396386334,/scholar?cites=9763757579396386334,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197734,0,0,0

The resulting models were then used to predict the binding activity of 264 external compounds. which were available to us after the models were developed.

Although this is an area that has attracted great scientific effort since the Society of Toxicology was founded in 1961. chemical toxicology and safety has been regarded as the major reason for attrition of new drugs in the past decade. 1 The regulatory evaluation of chemical toxicity in vivo and through all the animal models used by pharmaceutical companies at the early stage of the drug discovery process is expensive and time consuming.

1213988,Developing advanced rules and tools to improve in vivo QSAR models,2016,Marlene T Kim,,,,,,Description Together oral bioavailability and hepatotoxicity determine the fate and failure of a new drug in clinical trials. A promising drug candidate that has little to no oral bioavailability could be considered an ineffective treatment. If the drug does have high oral bioavailability. yet exhibits severe hepatotoxicity. the drug will be withdrawn from clinical trials. Thus. oral bioavailability and hepatotoxicity account for a substantial number of drugs eliminated from therapies and withdrawn from the market. Not only is this a severe financial loss for a pharmaceutical company; it is also a loss for patients who will no longer be able to benefit from the therapeutic effects. The most common approach to testing oral bioavailability and hepatotoxicity before clinical trials is through animal testing. The information learned from animal testing is highly valuable. but is expensive. time consuming. and has low throughput.

Its electrochemical behavior in Britton–Robinson (B–R) buffers of pH 2–11 at a mercury electrode has been investigated using dc-polarography. cyclic voltammetry and controlled-potential coulometry. Polarograms of the drug in B–R buffers of pH 2–10 exhibited three 2-electron waves. while at pH>10. only a single 4-electron wave was observed. The first. second. and third waves in buffers of pH≤10 may be attributed to the reduction of N-oxide. CN and CN centers. respectively.

To monitor these ions. inexpensive. label-free chemical sensing devices are needed. Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on silicon (Si) nanowires or nanoribbons (NRs) have a great potential as future biochemical sensors as they allow for the integration in microscopic devices at low production costs. Integrating NRs in dense arrays on a single chip expands the field of applications to implantable electrodes or multifunctional chemical sensing platforms. Ideally. such a platform is capable of detecting numerous species in a complex analyte. Here. we demonstrate the basis for simultaneous sodium and fluoride ion detection with a single sensor chip consisting of arrays of gold-coated SiNR FETs. A microfluidic system with individual channels allows modifying the NR surfaces with self-assembled monolayers of two types of ion receptors sensitive to sodium and fluoride ions. The functionalization procedure results in a differential setup having active fluoride-and sodium-sensitive NRs together with bare gold control NRs on the same chip. Comparing functionalized NRs with control NRs allows the compensation of non-specific contributions from changes in the background electrolyte concentration and reveals the response to the targeted species.

Its photophysical and electrochemical properties are evaluated in comparison with an analogous molecule. representative of a single fin of the iptycene. Homoconjugation through the delocalised LUMO of the iptycene facilitates a great increase in transition probability both to and from the ICT state. while the deep blue photoluminescence of the single fin is retained. The peripherally distributed HOMO of the iptycene also permits reversible access to a tricationic state in a single step and at an oxidation potential lower than that of the single fin.

These include two isomeric bicarbazoles. a bis(dibenzothiophene‐S.S‐dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene‐S.S‐dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. supported by density functional theory. have given detailed insights into how para‐ vs. meta‐ vs. broken conjugation. and electron‐rich vs. electron‐poor heterocycles impact the HOMO‐LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts. the triplet energy (ET) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films. related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in ET of 0.24 eV in the different media – sufficiently large to “make‐or‐break” an OLED device – with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations. we identify that only the lower ET values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility.

The existing methods for performing these experiments include sonochemiluminescence (SCL) and chemical dosimetric methods. The particles in a liquid decrease the ultrasonic intensity threshold needed for cavitation onset. In this study. a new nanoconjugate made up of Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and gold nanoparticles (GNP). i.e.. Au-PpIX was used to provide nucleation sites for cavitation. The nonradiative relaxation time of PpIX in the presence of GNPs is longer than the similar time for PpIX without GNPs. This effect can be used in medical diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Materials and Methods The acoustic cavitation activity was investigated studying integrated SCL signal in the wavelength range of 400-500 nm in polyacrylamide gel phantom containing luminol using a cooled CCD spectrometer at different intensities of 1 MHz ultrasound. In order to confirm these results. a chemical dosimetric method was utilized. too. Results SCL signal level in gel phantom containing Au-PpIX was higher than the other phantoms. These results have been confirmed by the chemical dosimetric data. Conclusion This finding can be related to the existence of PpIX as a sensitizer and GNPs as cavitation nuclei. In other words. nanoparticles have acted as the sites for cavitation and have increased the cavitation rate. Another theory is that activation of PpIX has produced more free radicals and has enhanced the SCL signal level.,True,bkr-vjcAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,3,http://ijmp.mums.ac.ir/article_329_9.html,4285165134033239278,/scholar?cites=4285165134033239278,,http://ijmp.mums.ac.ir/article_329_76c8fea72b6b26c080fd42f3ff9fa9ce.pdf,0,0,0

Our method involves first determining the minimum energy path (MEP) for the reaction by means of an ab initio intrinsic reaction coordinate calculation. This one-dimensional potential is then corrected to take into account the zero point energies of the spectator modes. These are determined from Hessians in curvilinear coordinates after projecting out the modes to be explicitly treated in quantum scattering calculations. The final (1 + 1)-dimensional potential is constructed by harmonic expansion about each point along the MEP before transforming the whole surface to hyperspherical coordinates for use in the two-dimensional scattering simulations. This new method is applied to H-atom abstraction from methane. ethane and propane.

1214096,Fluctuation of global quantities in highly correlated systems.,2005,Simon Trevor Banks,,,,,,This thesis addresses the nature of global (many body) fluctuations in highly correlated systems. We begin with the question of temperature dependence in finite two dimensional XY (2dXY) model magnets. Such systems have a fully critical low temperature phase. It is shown analytically. backed up by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. that the non-Gaussian distribution of order parameter fluctuations is not strictly universal but has an explicit temperature dependence - contrary to previous findings. The temperature dependence is used to explain why past studies derived the same distribution for fluctuations of the full order parameter and an approximate linearized form. The appearance of spin vortices in the related Harmonic model is discussed and an argument is presented for why these defects must always appear as bound pairs. The linearized order parameter of the 2dXY model leads to a family of dimensionally dependent models defined in reciprocal space. An argument is presented for the interpretation of these systems as being critical and a direct space Hamiltonian is derived for the one dimensional case. This model has order parameter fluctuations distributed according to the Fisher-Tippett-Gumbel distribution from extreme value statistics (EVS). The link between criticality and EVS is investigated. as are the origins of the non-Gaussianity. The ability to distinguish between critical distributions is discussed. It is seen that for one. two and three dimensions the critical models presented lead to functionally similar fluctuation distributions. A previously reported link between EVS and l/f noise is investigated.

1214099,OH+ CH4→ H2O+ CH3,2008,Liesbeth MC Janssen and ST Banks and DC Clary and GC Groenenboom and A van der Avoird,,,,,,A reduced dimensionality quantum dynamics method is described for calculating stateselected reaction cross sections and rate constants for polyatomic reactions. The method treats explicitly the bonds being broken and formed. while the remaining degrees of freedom are accounted for by means of an effective potential. The close-coupled equations are derived in hyperspherical coordinates and solved using the R-matrix propagation scheme. Reaction probabilities are obtained by applying approximate boundary conditions directly in hyperspherical coordinates. The method is applied to the reaction OH+ CH4→ H2O+ CH3. The CH4OH potential energy surface is obtained by fitting a double Morse analytical function to a set of high level ab initio points. with single point energies calculated at the CCSD (T)/cc-pVTZ//MP2/ccpVTZ level of theory. The zero-point energies of the spectator modes are included prior to fitting to account for the quantum nature of the neglected degrees of freedom. The results indicate that the reaction is significantly enhanced by excitation of the C–H stretch. Calculated differential cross sections show that the H2O product is predominantly scattered in the backward hemisphere. with a propensity for sideways scattering at high energies. The calculated rate constants compare very favorably with experiment. although the curvature of the Arrhenius plot is not completely reproduced.,True,QIp9dc4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,http://www.theochem.ru.nl/files/dbase/Janssen-CH4OH-report-2008.pdf,,,,http://www.theochem.ru.nl/files/dbase/Janssen-CH4OH-report-2008.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. we experimentally demonstrate. for the first time. the effect of varying static electric fields on preformed fibrils of human serum albumin (HSA) in an electrowetting on dielectric type setup using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. We have found appreciable and continuous reduction in the β-sheet content of HSA fibrils up to an applied field of~ 8× 10 6 V m− 1.

The CAG repeat expansion in the exon 1 of the protein huntingtin (HTTex1) that causes the disease leads to the formation of HTT fibrils in vitro and vivo. An important question for understanding the molecular mechanism of HD is which role wild type HTT plays for the formation. propagation. and structure of these HTT fibrils. Here we report that fibrils of mutant HTTex1 are able to seed the aggregation of wild type HTTex1 into amyloid fibrils. which in turn can seed the fibril formation of mutant HTTex1.

To overcome these problems. graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets were fabricated and functionalized with SnO2 nanoparticles to produce H2 from water and degrade 2-chlorophenol under visible light irradiation. The fabricated samples showed enhanced photocatalytic activities for both H2 evolution and pollutant degradation as compare to bare g-C3N4 and SnO2. These enhanced photoactivities are attributed to the better charge separation as the excited electrons transfer from g-C3N4 to the conduction band of SnO2. This enhanced charge separation has been confirmed from photoluminescence spectra. steady state surface photovoltage spectroscopic measurement and formed hydroxyl radicals.

Monodisperse 5-nm Pd nanoparticles were synthesized via reduction of palladium(II) acetylacetonate in oleylamine using a borane tert-butylamine complex. The Au/Pd/p-GaAs Schottky diodes provided a barrier height of 0.68 eV. which is higher than room-temperature values reported in the literature. A double distribution was observed for the barrier height for the Schottky diodes from I–V–T measurements. A decrease in temperature lowered the zero-bias barrier height and increased the ideality factor. These observations were ascribed to barrier height inhomogeneities at the interface that altered the barrier height distribution. Values of the series resistance obtained by the Norde method decreased with increasing temperature.

The nanoparticles of all catalytically active transition metals have been prepared by using different methods and tested in various catalytic reactions[1]. Besides the monometallic nanoparticles. the interest in use of two metal-comprising (bimetallic) nanoparticles as heterogeneous catalysts has been increased in recent years[2].

In this brief review. the rationale behind the new synthesis of sequence-defined oligothioetheramides (oligoTEAs) will be placed in context with the accepted methods of peptide and peptoid synthesis. where all methods notably utilize chemical orthogonality in their design. Along with the conceptual design. we will discuss the assembly of oligoTEAs by highlighting the solution-phase kinetics of each orthogonal reaction. the liquid-phase fluorous purification methodology. a proof-of-principle synthesis. and the assembly of a full-length oligomer. Overall. the success of oligoTEAs stems from the rapid orthogonal chemical reactions at each end of the unique N-allyl-N-acrylamide monomer.

Traditional raw materials for fermentative production of lactic acid. refined sugars. are now being replaced with starch from corn. rice and other crops for industrial production. with a tendency for utilization of agro-industrial wastes. Processes based on renewable waste sources have ecological (zero CO2 emission. eco-friendly byproducts) and economical (cheap raw materials. reduction of storage costs) advantages. An intensive research interest has been recently devoted to develop and improve the lactic acid production on more complex industrial by-products. like thin stillage from bioethanol production. corncobs. paper waste. straw etc. Complex and variable chemical composition and purity of these raw materials and high nutritional requirements of lacid acid bacteria (LAB) are the main obstacles in these production processes. Media supplementation to improve the fermentation is an important factor. especially from an economic point of view.

Encapsulation of yoghurt culture in beads with diameter of 1 mm provides better results than encapsulation in beads with larger diameter. Alginate beads and chitosan coated beads have proved to be a strong barrier for nutrients from substrate. so samples with those beads have lower viable cell count. lower titratable acidity and higher pH value after 5h of fermentation at 42 C. than samples with WPC-alginate beads. Also those beads have significantly (P< 0.05) lower cell leaking. than WPC-alginate beads and lower antioxidant capacity. Encapsulation of yoghurt culture in WPC-alginate carrier with diameter of approximately 1mm provided the best characteristics for fermented product. Samples with these beads have significantly (P< 0.05) higher increase of viable cell number after fermentation. despite of major cell leaking (19.7%).

This included hydride migration of an imine ring expanded product and the ortho C–H bond activation of an aryl group of an imine if two phenyl groups were present on the α-carbon.

The appearance of D-relaxation in the loss spectra of non-hydrogen bonding methylated derivate of ibuprofen has proven that Debye relaxation is related solely with conformational changes of the carboxyl group. termed in this paper as synperiplanar-antiperiplanar. Our studies indicate that the presence of hydrogen bonding capabilities is not here the necessary condition to observe Debye process. however. their occurrence might strongly influence α- and D-relaxations dynamics.

Inc.,The RNA single bulge motif is an unpaired residue within a strand of several complementary base pairs. Structure and dynamics of RNA duplexes containing single adenosine (5′-GUCGAGCUG-3′/5′-CAGCCGAC-3′) and uridine bulge (5′-GUCGUGCUG-3′/5′-CAGCCGAC-3′) have been studied using NMR spectroscopy and in aqua simulation of molecular dynamics. In both NMR structures. the bulged residues are oriented toward the minor groove. The bulged adenosine participates in the base triple formation being coplanar with the 5′-neighboring residue G4 which pairs with cytidine C14 from the opposite strand. The uridine bulge adopts a looped-out conformation pointing toward the residue G15 and bridges the minor groove to 5′ side of the helix. NMR-derived structures have been used to formulate the initial RNA duplex models for the MD simulation. Results of molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent support the conclusion concerning the formation of a dinucleotide platform within the C: GA triple.

The model was computed by considering helix-helix interactions as primary constraints. using Monte Carlo simulations. The interactions between the TM2 and TM3 segments have been confirmed by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. increasing our confidence in the model. Several insights into the BTL transport mechanism were obtained by analyzing the model. For example. the observed cis-trans Leu-Pro peptide bond isomerization in the TM3 fragment may indicate a key conformational change during anion transport by BTL.

Although previous SERS studies have demonstrated high sensitivity and selectivity for red lake pigments using various pretreatment conditions. corresponding investigations of yellow lake pigments and paints are relatively sparse.

The layer below the perovskite must be robust to the strong organic solvents used to form the perovskite while the layer above has a limited thermal budget and must be processed in nonpolar solvents to prevent perovskite degradation. To circumvent these limitations. we developed a procedure where two transparent conductive oxide/transport material/perovskite half stacks are independently fabricated and then laminated together at the perovskite/perovskite interface. Using ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy. external quantum efficiency.

These processes can be monitored using a variety of techniques. Chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry are common techniques used to interrogate this behavior for molecules bound to mesoporous thin films of wide-bandgap semiconductors and insulators. In order to use these techniques to obtain accurate values for apparent diffusion coefficients. which are proxies for rate constants for self-exchange electron transfer. it is imperative to take into consideration nonidealities in redox titrations. parasitic currents. and ohmic resistances.

The reaction is found to be concerted rather than stepwise. and the transition state for the reaction is located. The effect of residue mutations both on the ion pair stability and on the barrier to amide hydrolysis is explored and found to be in agreement with experiment.

In addition to their assembly in the solid-state being fundamentally interesting and aesthetically pleasing. their potential applications have now pervaded in different areas of chemistry. biology and materials science. When framework materials are endowed with ‘flexibility’. they exhibit some properties (e.g.. stimuli-induced pore breathing and reversible phase transformations) that are distinct from their rigid counterparts. Benefiting from flexibility and porosity. these framework materials have shown promise in applications that include separation of toxic chemicals. isotopes and hydrocarbons. sensing. and targeted delivery of chemicals.

Ann Arbor. MI (United States); Ford Motor Company. Dearborn. MI (United States),A high-capacity. low-cost method for storing hydrogen remains one of the primary barriers to the widespread commercialization of fuel cell vehicles. Storage via adsorption is a promising approach due to its fast kinetics. reversibility. and high gravimetric densities. An unfortunate characteristic of adsorptive storage is that high gravimetric densities typically come at the expense of volumetric density (total basis). The goal of this project is to demonstrate best-in-class adsorbents based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that achieve high volumetric and gravimetric H 2 densities simultaneously. while maintaining reversibility and fast kinetics. This is accomplished using a combination ion of high-throughput computational screening and experimental synthesis and characterization. The performance of the most promising materials are projected to the system level by parameterizing system models developed by the Hydrogen Storage Engineering Center of Excellence (HSECoE).,True,9H4JCmgAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1502953,,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1502953,0,0,0

Although the 4S occurrences have been extensively investigated. the mechanism behind the common characteristics remains unclear. From the perspectives of broken-bond-induced local strain and the skin-depth charge and energy quantum trapping and the associated nonbonding electron polarization. we proposed herewith that the Coulomb repulsion between the “electric monopoles or dipoles locked in the elastic solid skins or the solidlike covering sheets of liquid droplets” forms the key to the 4S.

Both the size and shape of the nano-clusters have a strong influence on the Ni 2p satellite structures. For small Ni clusters. apart from the 6 eV satellite. a 3 eV satellite structure emerges in Ni 2p 3/2 photoemission spectra due to the existence of the 3 F atomic state. However. the intensity of the 3 eV satellite decreases with increasing cluster size because the Ni 3d level becomes increasingly occupied in large clusters. The increased electron population in the 3d level is achieved through electron transfer from the free-electron-like 4sp states to the unhybridized pure 3d spin down states; the latter is lower in energy than the 3d–4sp hybridized states. The correlation-induced 6 eV satellite energy is enhanced by Ar+ bombardment.

The binding energy of the Ni 2p3/2 main peak and satellite peak is found to have shifted monotonically in the direction opposite to each other. with the increase of Ni coverage. The reduced binding energy of the thin film’s main peak is strongly correlated to the Cu 4s/Ni 3d interfacial hybridization effect (s/d IHE) and the narrowing of the d band with the reduction of dimensions. while the increased satellite binding energy results from the combination of interface hybridization and expansion of an extended 4s-like state towards the vacuum.

KGaA,Proline has played a pivotal role in the development of the field of organocatalysis and is regarded by many as the archetypal organocatalyst. Indeed. proline has been known as a catalyst of the intramolecular aldol reaction since the 1970s. in what was originally thought to be a solitary example of novel reactivity. A mechanistic understanding of proline catalysis has the potential to allow the design of improved catalysts and reaction conditions. The chapter discusses the mechanism of the proline‐catalyzed aldol reaction. including the Hajos‐Parrish‐Eder‐Sauer‐Wiechert (HPESW) reaction. the Houk‐List model. the Seebach‐Eschenmoser Model. It also discusses the proline‐catalyzed α‐amination and α‐aminoxylation reactions.

1214465,Mechanistic insights into organocatalysis,2013,Paul Alexander Dingwall,,,,,,With a resurgence of interest at the turn of the millennium. organocatalysis has become an established field in chemical research. Proline. in particular. has played a central role in the profusion of research. As the archetypal organocatalyst. proline mediated transformations have acted as a point of reference against which the performance of new developments in the field are benchmarked and compared. The field as a whole has benefited from a timely merging of complementary experimental. kinetic. and computational studies. through which a comprehensive picture of reaction mechanisms has been drawn. The research documented in this thesis attempts to build on this successful multi-faceted approach to elucidate further mechanistic insights into organocatalysis.The proline mediated conjugate addition of aldehydes to nitroalkenes has been investigated via a ‘kinetics first’approach. through the use of Reaction Progress Kinetic Analysis (RPKA) methodology. It was discovered that proline is irreversibly removed from the catalytic cycle via initiation of a polymerisation reaction of the nitrostyrene substrate. Additionally. it was found that this off-cycle pathway was not limited to proline alone. but also occurs with a number of secondary amine compounds. including other organocatalysts.,True,fQvIat8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76989682.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76989682.pdf,0,0,0

BTD= 2. 1. 3-benzothiadiazole). Depending on the nature of the vinyl group. chromogenic and fluorogenic responses signalled the presence of this odourless. tasteless. invisible and toxic gas. Chloroform solutions of the complexes underwent rapid change between easily differentiated colours when exposed to air samples containing CO. More significantly. adsorbing the complexes on silica produced colorimetric probes for the ‘naked eye’detection of CO in the gas phase. Structural data for key species before and after addition of carbon monoxide were obtained by single X-ray diffraction techniques. In all cases the ruthenium and osmium vinyl complexes studied showed a highly selective response to CO with exceptionally low detection limits. Naked eye detection of CO at concentrations as low as 5 ppb in air was achieved with the onset of toxic levels (100 ppm) resulting in a remarkably clear colour change. Moreover. complexes bearing pyrene. naphthalene and phenanthrene moieties were fluorescent and greater sensitivities were achieved (through turn-on emission fluorescence) in the presence of carbon monoxide. both in solution and in air. This behaviour was explored computationally using TDDFT experiments. Additionally. the systems were shown to be selective for CO over all other gases tested. including water vapour and common organic solvents.

This key intermediate can be generated by the addition of NHCs to α.β-unsaturated aldehyde or acid derivatives. A wide variety of bisnucleophiles can add across the α.β-unsaturated acylazoliums to form various five and six-membered heterocycles and carbocycles.

In 1958. the mechanistic rationalization for the thiazolium salt-catalyzed benzoin condensation was provided by Breslow [1]. and almost three decades later. the isolation of free carbenes was reported by the Bertrand and coworkers [2] and Arduengo groups [3]. These seminal discoveries resulted in the exponential growth of research in NHC-organocatalysis.Carbonyl carbons are electrophilic in nature. However. the reversal of polarity of carbonyls is a challenging task and needs a strong base and harsh condition. The traditional methods for the generation of acyl anion equivalent involve the use of dithianes or protected cyanohydrin derivatives [4]. However. the recent advancement in umpolung of carbonyl functionality using catalytic and mild reaction condition has drawn much attention. In 1973. Stetter and Schreckenberg developed the first cyanide ion-catalyzed reaction of aldehydes with Michael acceptors such as α. β-unsaturated carboxylic esters. ketones. and nitriles proceeding via the umpolung strategy [5]. Three years later. Stetter demonstrated the thiazolium salt-catalyzed highly selective conjugate addition of a wide variety of aliphatic. aromatic. and heteroaromatic aldehydes with a broad range of Michael acceptors for the synthesis of 1. 4-bifunctional compounds (Scheme 3.1)[6].

Many drug substances require the application of water/additive-free solvents to guide process efforts which are intrinsically incompatible with reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) conditions. Sub/supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) helps to overcome many of these challenges delivering unmatched speed. with low cost. high-efficiency and an additive-free environment ideal for reaction monitoring of species chemically susceptible to water. Herein. we provide several examples where traditional RPLC fails or delivers sub-optimal performance in monitoring processes.

Assessment of the biomedical applications of metallosupramolecular assemblies is an emerging field of research that stems from the recently demonstrated promising results on such systems. After the pioneering works of Therrien and coworkers on organometallic Ru-cages with promising anticancer properties. this topic has evolved to the more recent studies on bioactivity of supramolecular coordination complexes built from different metal ions and various multidentate ligands. Sufficient amount of data on the anticancer activity of metallosupramolecules has already been reported and allows outlining some general tendencies in the structural aspects of the biological activity. The main structural properties of the complexes that can be readily modified to enhance their activity are the size. the shape and charge of the formed complexes. Moreover. the intrinsic properties of the building components could predetermine some of the main characteristics of the overall supramolecular complex. such as its optical properties. chemical reactivity. solubility. etc.. and could. thereby. define the areas of its biomedical applications.

The lines in the rhombic spectra shift as a function of temperature. This can be traced to the presence of two close lying spin doublet states. with different g tensors. that interconvert quite rapidly. Therefore. the lines observed in the spectrum have the Boltzmann weighted average of the two g values. The interesting observation is that signals due to the excited spin doublet are observed. This means that the interconversion rate is of the same order of magnitude as the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance experiment.

On thebasis of comparative studies on similar structures. insight into the complexexcited state dynamics of such compounds has been gained. It has been shown.for example. that only compounds that possess hydroxyl groups arefluorescent. and that the possibility for cis-trans isomerisationand/or bending motions of the central bis-azomethine fragment allows fordifferent non-radiative decay pathways. The compound. 4.4'-dihydroxy-1.1'-naphthaldazine (1) was synthesized andcharacterized by means of spectroscopic and quantum chemical methods. Thetautomerism of 1 was studied in details by steady state UV-Vis spectroscopyand time resolved flash photolysis.

Thus. the molarfraction of each component and the corresponding tautomeric constants wereestimated from the temperature dependent spectra in ethanol. According to the spectroscopic data the prevalent tautomer is the diol form.which is in agreement with the theoretical (HF and DFT) predictions.

The spectroscopic properties of CD-THPP have been investigated by combining NMR. circular dichroism. UV-vis absorption. fluorescence and laser flash photolysis techniques. allowing us to gaining insights into the self-association mode of the conjugate. In neat methanol. CD-THPP is present in a monomeric form and exhibits spectroscopic features virtually identical to those of the model compound p-THPP. The role of the CD macrocycle is essential in differentiating the behavior of the conjugate with respect to the non-modified porphyrin in the mixture water : methanol. 9 : 1 (v/v). Under these conditions. CD-THPP shows a marked tendency to self-arrange as a dimer. whose formation is strongly encouraged by stacking interactions between the aromatic rings. in addition to intermolecular hydrophobic porphyrincyclodextrin interactions. This supramolecular species exhibits a strong exciton coupling and. contrary to the unmodified p-THPP. shows a good response to light excitation. as confirmed by the considerable fluorescence emission and triplettriplet transient absorption. It is also demonstrated that incorporation of suitable guests into the CD cavity triggers a new rearrangement of the dimer with a higher degree of overlap between the porphyrin chromophores. facilitating the occurrence of intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer between the guest and the …,True,_thIlpkAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,0,https://arch.neicon.ru/xmlui/handle/123456789/4753449,,,,,0,0,0

To understand the relationship between these redox processes. an experimental study was carried out to probe the 1 e– and 2 e–/2 H+ reduction potentials of a number of common quinones. The results reveal a non-linear correlation between the 1 e– and 2 e–/2 H+ reduction potentials. This unexpected observation prompted a computational study of 134 different quinones. probing their 1 e– reduction potentials. pKa values. and 2 e–/2 H+ reduction potentials.

The chemical shifts of the protons of the methyl group. which are pointed toward the shielding zone of the phenyl ring. were monitored as the phenyl substituents were varied. This work indicates that the shielding effect of the phenyl ring is not so severely altered by the substituents as to significantly influence the chemical shift of the methyl group. Nonetheless. within the small changes observed experimentally. there appears to be a tendency for electron-withdrawing X to shift the methyl signal downfield. whereas electron-donating X-groups cause a more upfield shift.

Electronic devices based on organic molecules. especially those based on single molecules. receive intense studies both theoretically and experimentally.

However. decarboxylative reactions with malonic acid and its mono (thio) esters have been poorly investigated so far despite the potential to become a convenient route to β-trifluoromethyl-β-amino acid derivatives and to their partially saturated heterocyclic analogues.Results: In this paper we show that 4-trifluoromethylpyrimidin-2 (1H)-ones. unique heterocyclic ketimines. react with malonic acid under organic base catalysis to regioselectively provide either Michael-or Mannich-type decarboxylative addition products depending on solvent polarity. Malonic mono (thio) esters give exclusively Michael-type products. The two regioisomeric products can be converted into saturated (2-oxohexahydropyrimidin-4-yl) acetic acid derivatives by mild hydrogenation of the endocyclic C= C double bond in the presence of Pd/C as catalyst.

The UWOV2 cell line was derived from a cystadenocarcinoma in a patient refractory to combination chemotherapy with actinomycin D. vincristine (VCR). cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP) and doxorubicin (DXR). In an attempt to explain drug resistance in this cell line. we examined the effects of TM on their sensitivity to various anticancer drugs. the uptake. efflux and retention of [3H]VCR. and their ability to bind [14C]DXR and [3H]azidopine (AZD). a photoaffinity label of the multidrug transporter. P-glycoprotein (Pgp). TM effectively decreased the EC50 for DXR. EXR. VCR and CDDP. thus enhancing their cytotoxicity. The antibiotic also prolonged the intracellular retention time of [3H]VCR and increased the binding of both [14C]DXR and [3H]AZD to the cells. It is concluded that the pharmacomodulatory effects of TM in these cells are mediated by global inhibition of protein and glycoprotein synthesis and synergistic interaction with antineoplastic drugs.

As a consequence the supplement industry has grown to meet the increasing demand. A Global Industry Analysts Inc. report indicates that the herbal supplement market has not declined during the worldwide recession. but in fact exhibited steady growth over the period 2008 to 2009. It is anticipated that the market will reach US$93.15 billion by the year 2015. These supplements may contain adulterated substances that may potentially have harmful short - and long-term health consequences to the consumer. “Scrap Melamine” is such an example. which has been implicated in the kidney failure and death of several cats. dogs and pigs. In China in 2008. reports described very severe health effects in infants and young children. At the time over 294 000 infants were screened and diagnosed with urinary tract stones and sand-like calculi associated with melamine in milk products. of which 50 000 infants were hospitalised. and at least six associated deaths. recorded. The extent that melamine contamination occurs in nutritional supplements is not known. Therefore. the aim of this study was to determine whether commercially available nutritional and traditional supplement products contain melamine. even though they are not declared by the manufacturer on the product label.

There is no clear distinction between the regulation of food. supplements and medicines in South Africa. Consequently. grey areas exist in implementing the legislation. particularly in the supplement industry. The increase in supplement sales in South Africa can be attributed to aggressive marketing by manufacturers whose claims are not always supported by published peer-reviewed evidence. Such claims often go unchecked. resulting in consumers being mislead about the role of supplements. As a result of poor regulation. contaminants or adulterants in supplements may also cause insidious effects unrelated to the listed ingredients. Aim. To assess the regulations. legislation. and claims associated with nutritional supplement products in South Africa. Method. Peer-reviewed literature and the relevant South African statutes were consulted. Results. The National Health Act incorporates the Medicine Control Council. which is charged with ensuring the safety. quality and effectiveness of medicines. and related matters. including complementary/alternative medicines. The South African Institute for Drug-Free Sport and Amendment Act provides for testing athletes for using banned substances. but currently does not concern itself with monitoring nutritional supplements for contaminants or adulterants that may cause a positive drug test. which has implications for sports participants and also the health of the general population. The implementation of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA) could protect consumer rights if it is administered and resourced appropriately. Conclusion.

To assist this process. it is important to have specific knowledge and understanding of the claims made on labels of nutritional supplement products used for general. and more specifically. for sports consumers. The industry is not regulated. and therefore the claims that are made may not always be accurate.Method: The aim was to describe the labelling and claims information on the labels of a select group of nutritional supplements. either manufactured in. or imported into South Africa. Specific predetermined categories of labelling and claims made on the containers were assessed and summarised.Results: Forty products were selected for analysis. of which 21 (53%) were locally assembled or manufactured products. and 19 (48%). international imported products. Ninety-five per cent of products contained a warning statement on the label. Eighty-five per cent of the nutritional supplement products had a disclaimer on the label. Ninety-eight per cent of the nutritional supplement product labels included some claim on the label.Conclusion: The following information. in particular. needs to be regulated and enforced as part of the labelling process. to ensure that the consumer can make an informed choice.

1214924,Nutritional supplements use. cost. source of information. and practices by Johannesburg North gym goers,2020,Y Coopoo and X McCreanor and G Gabriels,32,South African Journal of Sports Medicine,1,,,Background: Nutritional supplements are defined as any dietary supplement manufactured product that is generally intended to supplement the diet when taken by mouth as a pill. capsule. tablet. or liquid. Currently. the use of nutritional supplements is on the increase worldwide. predominantly in Western countries but also more recently expanding to other parts of the world for what has become a multibillion-dollar global industry. As a result. consumer demand has caused the increase in the advertising and marketing of these products.

1214925,The potential impact of dietary supplement adulteration on patient assessment and treatment from a healthcare provider’s perspective,2019,Gary Gabriels and Mohamed Irhuma,,South African Family Practice,,,Taylor & Francis,Dietary supplements have been manufactured and supplied to the market with the objective of enhancing the overall health of the general population and optimising the performance of athletes. The perceived intention of dietary supplementation is to increase the nutritional content of a normal diet. and to fill a dietary need and/or presumed deficiency. The usage and popularity of dietary supplements. however. raises concerns from a health benefit and risk perspective. Moreover. safety and efficacy of these supplements have generally not been established by the Medicines Regulatory Authorities. both nationally and internationally. The exponential increase in supplement sales can. however. be attributed to aggressive marketing by manufacturers. rather than the development of more effective nutritional supplements.

The situation is further exacerbated by the general pressure placed on certain groups to use supplements. For example. young sports participants who are engaged in developmental and competitive phases of sport. encounter peer pressure to use supplements. As a consequence the supplement industry has grown to meet the increasing demand. These supplements may contain adulterated substances that may potentially have harmful short-and long-term health consequences. The regulation of the supplement industry is unrefined. which increases the risk of the nutritional supplements being contaminated. Contamination may be intentional. where the companies' spike'their products with an ergogenic aid. or unintentional. A consequence of contamination is that an athlete may fail a drug test after ingesting a contaminated supplement or there may be negative health consequences. This impasse has brought uncertainty to the minds of well intentioned athletes. and has also compromised the development of the legitimate nutritional supplement industry.Aim:The research study investigated the industry. associated with commercially available nutritional and traditional supplements. In particular the research assessed the content of these products for prohibited substances. with reference specifically to steroids. that may not necessarily be declared by the manufacturer on the product label.Methods:A total of 138 nutritional supplements products formed part of the assessment. were obtained from direct purchases from shops. pharmacies and outlets …,True,hIKJ-68AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jpssuppl/WCP2018/0/WCP2018_PO3-12-7/_article/-char/ja/,,,,,0,0,0
1214927,Sports Nutrition and Ortho Congress,2016,Gary Gabriels and Darlene Miller,6,J Sports Med,5,,,Charcot neuropathic arthropathy of the foot (CF) is a fairly common and devastating complication normally found in patients with long standing. mostly uncontrolled. diabetes. Occurring in up to 10 percent of the diabetic population. CF is characterized by a relatively painless. progressive and degenerative bone and joint destructive process with neuropathy and trauma as essential components. The absence of normal proprioceptive and protective mechanisms results in pathological fractures. deformity. and ulceration. with potential for limb loss. In the diabetic patient. concomitant risk factors for the development of CF include vascular disease. neuropathy. limited joint mobility. previous foot ulcer or amputation and nephropathy. Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) is an accepted approach and treatment of choice in patients with type I diabetes with accompanying end stage renal disease (ESRD). Documented cases in the literature reveal CF as a post-transplant consequence. Traditional post-operative immunosuppressive therapy is identified as an additional risk factor for the development of de novo CF after SPKT. This report describes an unusual case of a patient who presented with a case of full-blown CF deformity with ulceration soon after SPKT. Post-SPKT immunosuppression therapy. particularly the use of corticosteroids. is acknowledged as a causative influence for the development of neuroarthropathy leading to CF. michael. wilson9@ va. gov,True,hIKJ-68AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12731284721939395450&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

An imbalance of species within this biofilm may result in endogenous opportunistic infections such as aerobic vaginitis (AV) caused by S. agalactiae and E. faecalis. which have been implicated in neonatal and obstetric sepsis. The prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of E. faecalis and S. agalactiae in pregnant women with AV in the Western Cape. South Africa was determined using standard microbiological culture methods and the Sensititre TREK system. AV was detected in 26.13% of the 199 tested pregnant women. with S. agalactiae and E. faecalis isolated from 32 and 20 mothers respectively. S. agalactiae and E. faecalis showed resistance to 12 of the 17 antibiotics tested. including those recommended for prophylaxis according to the CDC guidelines. The resistance of S. agalactiae and E. faecalis to commonly administered antimicrobials highlights the need for alternative treatment regimens for AV during pregnancy to reduce the risk of AV-associated negative pregnancy outcomes.,True,hIKJ-68AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,0,http://repository.uwc.ac.za/handle/10566/2442,,,,,0,0,0

Prot. Stored Prod. IOBC-WPRS Bull,,31-38,,Inert dusts (IDs). as Kaolin (K) and diatomaceous earth (D) powders. and aromatic plant essential oils (EOs) are among the most appealing alternatives to traditional chemical insecticides. against stored-products and field crops pests. IDs and EOs are environmentally friendly and very low toxic to mammalian. In addition. it has been proven that insects are not able to develop resistance to IDs. Recent studies indicate that. when used in combination. aromatic plant EOs may enhance the insecticidal efficacy of IDs. Such effect could be due both to the physical action of IDs on the cuticle and the supposed neurotoxic effects of EOs.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the two aromatic plants Pistacia lentiscus and Foeniculum vulgare EOs. of K and D powders and of the IDs-EOs mix as grain protectants against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky)(Curculionidae).

Results were recorded after three. six and nine days of treatment. Orthogonal contrasts analysis shows that the action of IDs was higher when used in combination with the EOs (P< 0.05).

This bacterium produces. among other virulence factors. a soluble d-galactose-specific lectin PA-IL (LecA). PA-IL plays an important role in the adhesion to the host cells and is also cytotoxic. Therefore. this protein is an interesting therapeutic target. suitable for inhibition by carbohydrate-based compounds. In the current study. β-d-galactopyranoside-containing tri-and tetravalent glycoclusters were synthesized. Methyl gallate and pentaerythritol equipped with propargyl groups were chosen as multivalent scaffolds and the galactoclusters were built from the above-mentioned cores by coupling ethylene or tetraethylene glycol-bridges and peracetylated propargyl β-d-galactosides using 1. 3-dipolar azide-alkyne cycloaddition. The interaction between galactoside derivatives and PA-IL was investigated by several biophysical methods. including hemagglutination inhibition assay. isothermal titration calorimetry. analytical ultracentrifugation. and surface plasmon resonance. Their ability to inhibit the adhesion of P. aeruginosa to bronchial cells was determined by ex vivo assay. The newly synthesized multivalent galactoclusters proved to be significantly better ligands than simple d-galactose for lectin PA-IL and as a result. two representatives of the dendrimers were able to decrease adhesion of P. aeruginosa to bronchial cells to approximately 32% and 42%. respectively.

Idraparinux is a synthetic anticoagulant pentasaccharide based on the heparin antithrombin-binding domain. In the frame of our ongoing research aimed at the synthesis of sulfonic acid-containing heparinoid anticoagulants. we elaborated a modular pathway to obtain a series of idraparinux-analogue pentasaccharides bearing one or two primary sulfonic acid moieties. Five protected pentasaccharides with different C-sulfonation patterns were prepared by two subsequent glycosylation reactions. respectively. using two monosaccharide and four disaccharide building blocks. Transformation of the protected derivatives into the fully O-sulfated. O-methylated sulfonic acid end-products was also studied.

As follows from the data obtained. the rate of oxidation of organic substances on the anode materials involved is proportional to the number of reactive oxygen species in the near-electrode zone (OH–radicals) formed during the electrolysis as intermediates in water oxidation and participating in subsequent homogeneous chemical reactions with organic substrates in the bulk. The O1s peak on X– Ray photoelectron spectra was used to evaluate the amount of inert and labile oxygencontaining particles on undoped and doped PbO2 . Doping of lead dioxide with nickel leads to a significant increase in the number of labile oxygen-containing particles on the surface of the electrode. while iron modification leads to the opposite effect – an increase in the amount of inert oxygen-containing particles. The anodic oxidation of 4-chlorophenol yields a rather large number of intermediate products. The main intermediates include benzoquinone and maleic acid which was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography.

The content of organic substance in the composite coating can vary from 3.4 to 12.5 wt.%. The change in deposition conditions (temperature. pH and anodic current density) allows controlling the content of surfactant in the resulting oxide. The electocatalytic activity of the materials involved was investigated in respect to the oxygen evolution reaction and the electrochemical oxidation of 4-chlorophenol. The calculated value of Tafel slope is 229 mV dec–1 for non-modified PbO2. while it is 178 mV dec–1 for composite of PbO2 with 10.2 wt.% of sodium laureth sulfate. According to absorption spectra. the initial solution of 4-chlorophenol is characterized by two peaks at 220 and 280 nm. At first. the electrolysis leads to a decrease in the peak at 220 nm. a slight increase of the peak at 280 nm and the appearance of the plateau at 240–270 nm. This is caused by a decrease in the concentration of 4-chlorophenol and accumulation of benzoquinone in the solution. A further increase in the electrolysis duration results in the disappearance of the peaks at 220 and 280 nm and the reduction of the plateau at 240–270 nm due to a decrease in the concentrations of both 4-chlorophenol and benzoquinone.

On CV several characteristic areas can be distinguished: at the anode region of CV at potentials higher than 1.4 V. an anode current is growing exponentially due to the simultaneous reactions of Pb (II) oxidation and oxygen evolution. At the cathodic branch of CV. a current maximum is observed at potentials of 1.0–1.2 V. corresponding to the reaction of the reduction of lead dioxide. When polyaminoguanidine hydrochloride is present in the electrolyte. the electrodeposition of lead dioxide is inhibited. In the presence of anionic polymer additive Nafion® in the electrolyte. one can see an increase in the peak of cathodic reduction of lead dioxide. which indicates an increase in the formation rate of PbO 2. The addition to the deposition electrolyte of anionic surfactants leads to a slight inhibition of the process of deposition of PbO 2.

However. it also represents one of the most challenging reactions in modern synthetic organic chemistry because the multitude of aliphatic CH bonds in a molecule makes site selective oxidation particularly difficult. Moreover. the introduction of chirality represents an unmet but very appealing challenge. because the asymmetric oxidation of hydrocarbons produces chiral compounds of high value in organic synthesis from readily available starting materials.

By using experimental results within the CpHMD method. the simulations show that the protonation states of neighbouring residues are anti-correlated so that the charges are well-separated.

The final produced long nicked double-stranded DNA loses the ability to protect AgNPs from salt-induced aggregation. The stability variation of the colloid system can then be monitored by recording corresponding UV-vis spectrum and initial miRNA level is thus determined. This sensing system involves only four DNA strands which is quite simple. The practical utility is confirmed to be excellent by employing different biological samples.,True,c2mSdm0AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,28,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep32219,11939239548873179859,/scholar?cites=11939239548873179859,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep32219,0,0,0

Sample concentration in MSS mainly relies on the reversal in the effective electrophoretic mobility of the analyte at the boundary zone between the sample solution (S) and CZE background solution (BGS) inside the capillary. The basic condition for MSS is that the S is prepared in a matrix that contains an additive (i.e.. micelles) which interacts with and has an opposite charge compared to the analytes. In addition. the BGS must contain a sufficient percentage of organic solvent.

1215185,The green chemistry and Filipino approach to high school experiments in Saint Paul College Pasig,2015,Ronald G. Santos and Armando M. Guidote Jr.,7,International Journal of Curriculum and Instruction,2,51-57,World Council for Curriculum and Instruction (WCCI),This paper is a call for teachers to initiate measures in improving the quality of high school chemistry education in the Philippines and that is by going back to practical laboratory work. The experiment presented in this paper is a proof to the possibility of tailor-made experiments that integrate principles of green chemistry. Integrating green chemistry concepts in the design of high school chemistry experiments makes students aware of the responsibility that goes with the use and production of chemicals. Moreover. the experiment was designed to consciously integrate aspects of Filipino culture. values. and traditions. Such enculturation of chemistry by giving it a Filipino flavor aims to make the students own the science and not view it as something that is highly foreign. When students can relate to the chemical concepts illuminated in their culture they become more appreciative and receptive of the science giving them meaningful and lasting learning.,True,QfdFfU8AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,1,https://archium.ateneo.edu/chemistry-faculty-pubs/8/,1591406537520178064,/scholar?cites=1591406537520178064,,https://archium.ateneo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=chemistry-faculty-pubs,0,0,0

Four chosen existing Chemistry demonstrations (Blue Bottle Experiment. Copper Sulfate Experiment. Blown Away. Dancing Flames) were modified by using substitute reagents. which are more accessible. relatively safer. and at lower cost. These demonstrations were chosen based on how easily the substitute reagents will be obtained. Afterwards. with the permission of a private junior high school. they were presented to a group of Grade 9 students of their choosing. The students were asked to evaluate each demonstration using a Likert scale-based questionnaire. This questionnaire rates each demonstration in terms of aesthetics. the materials and procedure done. effectiveness to explain certain Chemistry topics. safety. and the students’ overall judgment regarding the use of demonstrations as teaching tools. By converting their evaluation to quantitative values. the demonstrations scored high in all major categories.

The block copolymers consisted of a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) segment and an anionic or cationic polymer segment. These copolymers exhibited lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior at ca. 35-40°C. and achieved thermal stimuli-induced formation and dissociation of micelles. The copolymer generated micelles in aqueous solution at a higher temperature. where a catalytic aldol reaction proceeded with high diastereo- and enantioselectivities. The micelles dissociated at lower temperature to form a clear solution such that the products could be efficiently extracted from the aqueous reaction mixture. Extraction of the aldol product with an organic solvent from the aqueous solution of the anionic copolymer was more efficient than from the nonionic copolymer solution.,True,QfdFfU8AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,0,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/ben/loc/2020/00000017/00000009/art00009,,,,,0,0,0

The reaction makes use of palladium as an effective catalyst and tin (II) chloride as a low-valent reducing agent which also effectively transforms the allylic group to a nucleophilic group. The organic. as well as organometallic. chemistry of how the transformations occur and how the metals take part in the reaction is of great interest. These could help allow for better optimization of reagents and solvents. for better control of the extent of reaction or yield of desired product. and for possible applications in other reaction systems.

Lee-Chua,28,Kimika,2,13-21,Chemical Society of the Philippines,As the K to 12 Science program was formally implemented. interventions to enhance competence and confidence of teachers in teaching science in a spiral progression approach are main concerns. This study aims to assess the chemistry content knowledge and self-efficacy of 38 in-service teachers enrolled in a graduate program from a teacher education institution using a content knowledge test (CKT) and a self-efficacy beliefs scale (SeS) using a mixed-method approach. Quantitative findings reveal that the least mastered topics in chemistry of the teacher-respondents include solutions. chemical bonding. the mole concept. gas laws. and chemical reactions. The science teachers say they are “somewhat confident” in teaching the chemistry topics. Qualitative findings include difficulties in answering the CKT and challenges encountered in teaching chemistry using the K to 12 science curriculum. In the needs analysis. key findings in the results of focus group discussion are used to verify quantitative findings. The correlation between content knowledge and self-efficacy beliefs is r=-0.12. with findings showing a negligible to low correlation. This implies that even if teachers perceive that they are “somewhat confident” in teaching chemistry topics. such beliefs do not match their content knowledge scores. Valid findings are based on the CKT results and further suggest that the CKT (not the SeS) is a good measure in determining the content learning needs of teachers.,True,QfdFfU8AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,http://kimika.pfcs.org.ph/index.php/kimika/article/view/236,,,,https://kimika.pfcs.org.ph/index.php/kimika/article/view/236/198,0,0,0

These criteria are used to determine how certain NOS dimensions are mentioned and elaborated in those textbooks. Such dimensions emphasize that chemistry is (1) tentative.(2) empirical.(3) model-based.(4) inferential.(5) has technological products.(6) employs instrumentation. and (7) possesses social and societal dimensions. Three book chapters were read and evaluated: the first (on chemistry in general); the second (on atomic structure); and the sixth or seventh chapters (on the electronic structure of atoms). The relevant content in each textbook were rated using the following rubric: Satisfactory and Explicit (S. 2 points); Mention and Implicit (M. 1 point); and No Mention (N. 0 point). Silberberg (2009) has the highest score among the six textbooks with 12 points out of the maximum of 14. It was rated S for five criteria. the most among the six textbooks. Despite the presence of some N evaluations. all textbooks have mentioned some or all of the NOS dimensions formulated. resulting to M and S ratings.

The main drawback associated with ALA-based photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) and ALA fluorescence diagnosis results from the hydrophilic nature of ALA and lack of selectivity for tumor versus nontumor cells. The application of certain triggers. such as pH. into conventional sensitizers for controllable 1 O 2 release is a promising strategy for tumor-targeted treatment.MethodsA series of pH-sensitive ALA-poly (L-histidine)[p (L-His) n] prodrugs were synthesized via ring opening polymerization of 1-benzyl-N-carboxy-L-histidine anhydride initiated by the amine hydrochloride group of ALA itself.

The early weeks of the first semester are especially critical to student engagement and early attrition. This study investigated the perceived early transition needs of three cohorts of commencing students in their first three weeks of university study in a Health Faculty. A short survey was developed based on a systematic understanding of student transition and supplemented by open-ended qualitative data. The results showed a stable. consistent pattern of early transition needs across the cohorts. with commencing students expressing most concern about accessing resources. balancing work. family and study commitments. establishing peer relationships. and understanding the requirements and standards for early assessment tasks …,True,o2CY95wAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,62,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075079.2014.966070,7090149775547044073,/scholar?cites=7090149775547044073,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicholas_Buys/publication/277881783_Understanding_the_early_transition_needs_of_diverse_commencing_university_students_in_a_health_faculty_informing_effective_intervention_practices/links/564465c908ae451880a72aba/Understanding-the-early-transition-needs-of-diverse-commencing-university-students-in-a-health-faculty-informing-effective-intervention-practices.pdf,0,0,0

The cytochrome P450cin−substrate complex crystal structure has been solved to 1.7 Å resolution and compared with that of cytochrome P450cam. Despite the similarity in substrates. the active site of cytochrome P450cin is substantially different from that of cytochrome P450cam in that the B‘ helix. essential for substrate binding in many cytochrome P450s including cytochrome P450cam. is replaced by an ordered loop that results in substantial changes in active site topography.

The bioscience laboratory is a specialised. tightly regulated learning environment and a potentially rich learning platform for students. but when the laboratory tutors are inadequately trained. the flow-on effects to the students can produce unfavourable learning outcomes. Traditionally. new tutors attend a generic sessional training workshop offered by the university. Due to the added health & safety considerations and the type of learning (kinaesthetic) that occurs in the laboratory. we identified a need for a specific professional development program for laboratory tutors. Our aim was to develop a program that allowed tutors to work within a framework tailored for laboratory teaching and. in a supportive environment. build teaching skills that promote student learning. Based on Lave’s theory of situated learning (Lave. 1991) and the recognised approach of supported reflective practice (Bell. 2001) we placed opportunities for peer observation at the centre of the program. The framework presented here (3P’s) was developed specifically for laboratory tutors and served as behavioural guidelines for peer observation sessions. Ten participants volunteered for the pilot program which concluded in 2015. Peer observation records and focus group data were gathered to evaluate the pilot program.

The polymers differ in the ratio of hydrophobic to cationic subunits. The cationic homopolymer is inert against E. coli in BHI and LB. but becomes highly potent in EZRDM. A mixed hydrophobic/cationic polymer with a hydrophobic t-butylbenzoyl group at its N-terminus is effective in BHI. but becomes more effective in EZRDM. Supplementation of EZRDM with the tryptic digest of casein (often found in LB) recapitulates the LB and BHI behavior. Additional evidence suggests that polyanionic peptides present in LB and BHI may form electrostatic complexes with cationic polymers. decreasing activity by diminishing binding to the anionic lipopolysaccharide layer of E. coli. In contrast. two natural antimicrobial peptides show no medium effects. Thus. the use of a chemically defined medium helps to reveal factors that influence antimicrobial potency of cationic polymers and functional differences between these polymers and evolved antimicrobial peptides.,True,x4rx-S0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,38,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0104500,17272968178181461313,/scholar?cites=17272968178181461313,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0104500,0,0,0

These sequence- and stereo-random copolymers inhibit bacterial growth at relatively low concentrations. apparently via disruption of bacterial membranes. but they are relatively nondisruptive toward eukaryotic cell membranes (low hemolytic activity). In all previous examples. the hydrophobic subunits have contained cycloalkyl groups that incorporate the backbone Cα–Cβ bond.

However. chemical adsorption may also take place via two possible ways by forming coordinate covalent bond; one possible way is giving one pair of electrons (i.e. lone pair) from pyrrole type nitrogen atom to the Zn and the second possible way is giving one pair of electron (i.e. lone pair) from pyridine type nitrogen atom which already released the …,True,LY52Bx0AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,10,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166128003000800,1723822937251507526,/scholar?cites=1723822937251507526,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43408882/A_theoretical_search_on_metalligand_inte20160305-1189-kz2ccw.pdf,0,0,0

The supports employed were hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). 2.6‐ionene. 2.10‐ionene and a poly(vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride) latex. which all contain quaternary ammonium groups. In the strong basic medium. both manganese porphyrins showed high stabilities toward NaOCl but relatively lower stabilities toward H2O2. and the resistance of MnTDCSPP to degradation was higher than that of MnTSPP. In the acidic solution. both porphyrins showed increasing stabilities toward H2O2 as the pH went down. Toward HOCl.
