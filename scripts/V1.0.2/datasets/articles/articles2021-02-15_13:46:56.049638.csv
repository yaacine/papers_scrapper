1028666,Compilation and analysis of σ54-dependent promoter sequences,1999,Humberto Barrios and Brenda Valderrama and Enrique Morett,27,,22,4305-4313,Oxford University Press,Promoters recognized by the RNA-polymerase with the alternative sigma factor σ54 (Eσ54) are unique in having conserved positions around -24 and -12 nucleotides upstream from the transcriptional start site. instead of the typical -35 and -10 boxes. Here we compile 186 -24/-12 promoter sequences reported in the literature and generate an updated and extended consensus sequence. The use of the extended consensus increases the probability of identifying genuine -24/-12 promoters. The effect of several reported mutations at the -24/-12 elements on RNA-polymerase binding and promoter strength is discussed in the light of the updated consensus.,True,bt_f7vUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,441,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/27/22/4305/1144089,5020418816146228757,/scholar?cites=5020418816146228757,,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/27/22/4305/1144089?ijkey=6c97bfa994b075a080d367362b7fbd9363b94637&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha,0,0,0
1028667,Suicide inactivation of peroxidases and the challenge of engineering more robust enzymes,2002,Brenda Valderrama and Marcela Ayala and Rafael Vazquez-Duhalt,9,,5,555-565,Cell Press,As the number of industrial applications for proteins continues to expand. the exploitation of protein engineering becomes critical. It is predicted that protein engineering can generate enzymes with new catalytic properties and create desirable. high-value. products at lower production costs. Peroxidases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze a variety of oxygen-transfer reactions and are thus potentially useful for industrial and biomedical applications. However. peroxidases are unstable and are readily inactivated by their substrate. hydrogen peroxide. Researchers rely on the powerful tools of molecular biology to improve the stability of these enzymes. either by protecting residues sensitive to oxidation or by devising more efficient intramolecular pathways for free-radical allocation. Here. we discuss the catalytic cycle of peroxidases and the mechanism of the suicide inactivation process to establish a broad …,True,bt_f7vUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,334,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552102001497,1149223606029859481,/scholar?cites=1149223606029859481,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552102001497,0,0,0
1028668,Mechanism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa RhlR transcriptional regulation of the rhlAB promoter,2003,Gerardo Medina and Katy Juárez and Brenda Valderrama and Gloria Soberón-Chávez,185,Journal of Bacteriology,20,5976-5983,American Society for Microbiology Journals,Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains two transcription regulators (LasR and RhlR) that. when complexed with their specific autoinducers (3-oxo-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone and butanoyl-homoserine lactone. respectively) activate transcription of different virulence-associated traits. We studied the RhlR-dependent transcriptional regulation of the rhlAB operon encoding rhamnosyltransferase 1. an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the surfactant monorhamnolipid. and showed that RhlR binds to a specific sequence in the rhlAB regulatory region. both in the presence and in the absence of its autoinducer. Our data suggest that in the former case it activates transcription. whereas in the latter it acts as a transcriptional repressor of this promoter. RhlR seems to repress the transcription of other quorum-sensing-regulated genes; thus. RhlR repressor activity might be of importance in the finely regulated expression of …,True,bt_f7vUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,159,https://jb.asm.org/content/185/20/5976.short,13387964584906644287,/scholar?cites=13387964584906644287,,https://jb.asm.org/content/jb/185/20/5976.full.pdf,0,0,0

This hybrid combines the catalytic properties of the two above peroxidases. being able to oxidize typical LiP and MnP substrates. The catalytic mechanism is that of classical peroxidases. where the substrate oxidation is carried out by a two-electron multistep reaction at the expense of hydrogen peroxide. Elucidation of the structures of intermediates in this process is crucial for understanding the mechanism of substrate oxidation. In this work. the reaction of H2O2 with the enzyme in the absence of substrate has been investigated with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The results reveal an EPR signal with partially resolved hyperfine structure typical of an organic radical. The yield of this radical is ∼30%.

Metformin significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of 5637 and T24 cells in vitro; specifically. metformin induced an apparent cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phases. accompanied by a strong decrease of cyclin D1. cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). E2F1 and an increase of p21 waf-1. Further experiments revealed that metformin activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and suppressed mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). the central regulator of protein synthesis and cell growth. Moreover. daily treatment of metformin led to a substantial inhibition of tumor growth in a xenograft model with concomitant decrease in the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). cyclin D1 and p-mTOR. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that metformin efficiently suppresses the proliferation of bladder cancer cells and suggest that metformin may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of bladder cancer.

Such a transition involves functional alterations of transcriptional factors. yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) including KLF5 in the renewal and maintenance of stem/progenitor cells. Here we demonstrate that the pro-proliferative factor KLF5 becomes anti-proliferative upon TGFβ-mediated acetylation in an in vitro model of epithelial homeostasis. In the HaCaT epidermal cell line treated with or without TGFβ. we found that KLF5 was not only essential for cell proliferation. it was also indispensable for TGFβ-induced anti-proliferation in these cells.

Recently KLF5 was shown to reverse its function in proliferative and p15 regulation upon transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-mediated acetylation. To understand how KLF5 acetylation functions in TGFβ-induced p15 transcription. we characterized the interactions of KLF5 with other transcription factors and promoter DNA elements in the context of TGFβ. KLF5 interacted with Smad2–4 and Miz-1 in a TGFβ-independent manner. but interacted with Myc only when TGFβ was activated. and at least some of the interactions had an additive effect on TGFβ-induced p15 transcription. Oligo pulldown assays showed that binding of Myc to the Inr element was KLF5-dependent. and TGFβ could enhance the binding when more KLF5 was available. Furthermore.

In this study. we demonstrated that curcumin targeted KLF5 by promoting its proteasome degradation. but not by inhibiting its transcription in bladder cancer cells. We also demonstrated that lentivirus-based knockdown of KLF5 inhibited cancer cell growth. while over-expression of a Flag-tagged KLF5 could partially reverse the effects of curcumin on cell growth and cyclin D1 expression. Furthermore. we found that curcumin could down-regulate the expression of Hippo pathway effectors. YAP and TAZ. which have been reported to protect KLF5 protein from degradation. Indeed. knockdown of YAP by small interfering RNA caused the attenuation of KLF5 protein. but not KLF5 mRNA. which was reversed by co-incubation with proteasome inhibitor. A xenograft assay in nude mice finally proved the potent inhibitory effects of curcumin on tumor growth and the pro-proliferative YAP/TAZ/KLF5/cyclin D1 axis. Thus. our data indicates that curcumin promotes KLF5 proteasome-dependent degradation through targeting YAP/TAZ in bladder cancer cells and also suggests the therapeutic potential of curcumin in the treatment of bladder cancer.

Conditions previously used to probe the conformation of the mammalian ribosome in vitro used high Mg2+ concentrations that we find completely inhibit translation in vitro. We have therefore probed the conformation of the small ribosomal subunit in low concentrations of Mg2+ that support translation in vitro and compared it with the conformation of the 40S subunit at high Mg2+ concentrations. In low Mg2+ concentrations. we find significantly more changes in chemical probe accessibility in the 40S subunit due to subunit association or binding of the hepatitis C internal ribosomal …,True,aZ4sP94AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,52,https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/11/12/1898.short,18035551315462362742,/scholar?cites=18035551315462362742,,https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/11/12/1898.full.pdf,0,0,0

The major vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (RA) not only enforces the generation of Treg cells but also inhibits the differentiation of Th17 cells. Herein we show that RA enhances TGF-β signaling by increasing the expression and phosphorylation of Smad3. and this results in increased Foxp3 expression even in the presence of IL-6 or IL-21. RA also inhibits the expression of IL-6Rα. IRF-4. and IL-23R and thus inhibits Th17 development. In vitro.

However. how IL-27 induces the expansion of Tr1 cells has not been elucidated. In this study we demonstrate that IL-27 drives the expansion and differentiation of IL-10-producing murine Tr1 cells by inducing three key elements: the transcription factor c-Maf. the cytokine IL-21. and the costimulatory receptor ICOS. IL-27-driven c-Maf expression transactivates IL-21 production. which acts as an autocrine growth factor for the expansion and/or maintenance of IL-27-induced Tr1 cells. ICOS further promotes IL-27-driven Tr1 cells. Each of those elements is essential. because loss of c-Maf.

To execute these functions. CD8+ T cells must differentiate into CTLs. a process that is precisely regulated by a variety of cytokines. costimulatory molecules. and transcription factors. IL-21 is an IL-2 family cytokine and a growth factor for multiple lymphocyte effector lineages. including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Recent studies demonstrate that loss of IL-21 signaling results in reduced viral clearance in models of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. and also protection from type 1 diabetes in the NOD model.

The sensitivity and specificity and some other parameters of the following adaptive threshold methods of segmentation: the Niblack method. the Sauvola method. the White method. the Bernsen method. the Yasuda method and the Palumbo method. are calculated. Methods are applied to three types of images constructed by extraction of the brown colour information from the artificial images synthesized based on counterpart experimentally captured images. This paper presents usefulness of the microscopic image synthesis method in evaluation as well as comparison of the image processing results. The results of thoughtful analysis of broad range of adaptive threshold methods applied to: (1) the blue channel of RGB. (2) the brown colour extracted by deconvolution and (3) the ’brown component’ extracted from RGB allows to select some pairs: method and type of image for which this method is most efficient considering various criteria e.g. accuracy and precision in area detection or accuracy in number of objects detection and so on. The comparison shows that the White. the Bernsen and the Sauvola methods results are better than the results of the rest of the methods for all types of monochromatic images.

Among these. the analog [Bpa1.Nle8.18.Arg13.26.27.l-2-Nal23.Tyr34]bPTH-(1–34)NH2(Bpa1-PTH-(1–34)) displayed in vitroactivity with potency similar to that of PTH-(1–34). The radioiodinated analog 125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) cross-linked specifically to the hPTH1-Rc stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. A series of chemical and enzymatic digestions of the hPTH1-Rc–125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) conjugate suggested that a methionine residue (either Met414 or Met425) within the contact domain hPTH1-Rc-(409–437). which includes the transmembrane helix 6 and part of the third extracellular loop. as the …,True,mCPfXf4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,186,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818487522,3994303126801777339,/scholar?cites=3994303126801777339,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818487522,0,0,0

NEMO associates with the unphosphorylated IKK kinase C termini and activates the IKK complex's catalytic activity. However. detailed structural information about the NEMO/IKK interaction is lacking. In this study. we have identified the minimal requirements for NEMO and IKK kinase association using a variety of biophysical techniques and have solved two crystal structures of the minimal NEMO/IKK kinase associating domains. We demonstrate that the NEMO core domain is a dimer that binds two IKK fragments and identify energetic hot spots that can be exploited to inhibit IKK complex …,True,mCPfXf4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,132,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212608001019,4874839895124518784,/scholar?cites=4874839895124518784,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212608001019,0,0,0

Examining the structure of human PTH-(1–34) under conditions that encompass the different environments the hormone may experience in the approach to and interaction with the G-protein-coupled receptor (including benign aqueous and saline solutions and in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine). we observe no evidence for a U-shape conformation or any tertiary structure.

We find that rapamycin has a clear biphasic effect on insulin sensitivity in C2C12 myotubes. with enhanced responsiveness during the first hour that declines to almost complete insulin resistance by 24-48 hours. We and others have recently observed that chronic rapamycin treatment induces insulin resistance in rodents. at least in part due to disruption of mTORC2. an mTOR-containing complex that is not acutely sensitive to the drug. Chronic rapamycin treatment may also impair insulin action via the inhibition of mTORC1-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis and activity. which could result in a buildup of lipid intermediates that are known to trigger insulin resistance. We confirmed that rapamycin inhibits expression of PGC-1α. a key mitochondrial transcription factor. and acutely reduces respiration rate in myotubes. However. rapamycin did not stimulate phosphorylation of PKCθ. a central mediator of lipid-induced insulin resistance. Instead. we found dramatic disruption of mTORC2. which coincided with the onset of insulin resistance. Selective inhibition of mTORC1 or mTORC2 by shRNA-mediated knockdown of specific components (Raptor and Rictor. respectively) confirmed that mitochondrial effects of rapamycin are mTORC1-dependent. whereas insulin resistance was recapitulated only by knockdown of mTORC2. Thus. mTORC2 disruption. rather than inhibition of mitochondria. causes insulin resistance in rapamycin-treated myotubes. and this system may …,True,1VFNTioAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,73,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2012.00177/full,8201543197832388479,/scholar?cites=8201543197832388479,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2012.00177/full,0,0,0

Although previous studies demonstrate that endothelial dysfunction plays a critical role in neurovascular uncoupling in these conditions. the role of endothelial NO mediation in neurovascular coupling responses is not well understood. To establish the link between endothelial function and functional hyperemia. neurovascular coupling responses were studied in mutant mice overexpressing or deficient in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). and the role of P2Y1 receptors in purinergic glioendothelial coupling was assessed.

While dietary and lifestyle recommendations remain important factors in disease prevention and treatment. epidemiological data have made it clear that obesity and excess body weight remain significant risk factors for the disease. A number of potential direct and indirect relationships exist between obesity and increased risk of colon cancer. Several mechanisms which appear promising and warrant further investigation are discussed here. specifically the modifying role of insulin and insulin-like growth factors. leptin. adipose-tissue induced changes in estrogens and androgens. and inflammatory molecules.

Dietary restriction (DR). a limitation of calories in the absence of malnutrition. has been shown to dramatically improve the health and longevity of a number of species. and evidence shows that this intervention may have the potential to overcome some of the molecular and neurological deficits seen in aging and sleep decline. Using a 17‐beam infrared‐light paradigm as well as gene expression analysis. this study demonstrates that restriction of amino acids has significant effects on sleep/wake patterns in Drosophila Melanogaster. as well as alters the expression of genes essential to maintaining homeostatic sleep.This abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.

CSR involves changes in the chromatin state and the transcriptional activation of the IGH locus at the upstream and downstream switch (S) regions that are to undergo S–S DNA recombination. In addition. CSR involves the induction of AID expression and the targeting of CSR factors to S regions by 14-3-3 adaptors. and it is facilitated by the transcription machinery and by histone modifications.

An N-terminal fragment of human GEN1 has recently been shown to act as a Holliday junction resolvase. but little is known about the role of GEN-1 in vivo. Holliday junction resolution signifies the completion of DNA repair. a step that may be coupled to signaling proteins that regulate cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage. Using forward genetic approaches. we identified a Caenorhabditis elegans dual function DNA double-strand break repair and DNA damage signaling protein orthologous to the human GEN1 Holliday junction resolving enzyme. GEN-1 has biochemical activities related to the human enzyme and facilitates repair of DNA double-strand breaks. but is not essential for DNA double-strand break repair during meiotic recombination. Mutational analysis reveals that the DNA damage-signaling function of GEN-1 is separable from its role in DNA repair. GEN-1 promotes germ cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a pathway that acts in parallel to the canonical DNA damage response pathway mediated by RPA loading.

To date structural data on Henipaviruses are scarce. and their N and P proteins have never been characterized so far. Using both computational and experimental approaches we herein show that Henipaviruses N and P proteins possess large intrinsically disordered regions.

The evidence that their respective N-terminal and C-terminal domains are highly disordered under native conditions is expected to be invaluable for future structural studies by helping to delineate N and P protein domains amenable to crystallization.

It is well established that PPARs are the targets for the hypolipidemic synthetic compounds known as peroxisome proliferators. and it has been proposed that various long-chain fatty acids and metabolites of arachidonic acid serve as the physiological ligands that activate these receptors in vivo. However. a persistent problem is that reported values of the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kds) of complexes of PPARs with these ligands are in the micromolar range. at least an order of magnitude higher than the physiological concentrations of the ligands.

The non-specific DNA-binding protein Sso7d of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus is known to protect DNA from thermal denaturation. We report here that Sso7d promotes the renaturation of complementary DNA strands at temperatures above the melting point of the duplex. This novel annealing activity is strictly homology-dependent. and even one mismatch in a stretch of 17 complementary bases severely reduces its efficiency.

The possible contributions of exchangeable counterions to these puzzling processes remain underexplored. The objective of this report is to clarify scope and limitations of certain counteranions to modulate cellular uptake and anion carrier activity of oligo/polyarginines. The key finding is that the efficiency of counteranion activators depends significantly on many parameters such as activator–membrane and activator–carrier interactions. This finding is important because it suggests that counteranions can be used to modulate not only efficiency but also selectivity. Specifically. activator efficiencies are found to increase with increasing aromatic surface of the activator. decreasing size of the transported anion. increasing carrier …,True,0yLGX3YAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,144,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2005/ob/b501472g,4273081689476074964,/scholar?cites=4273081689476074964,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florent_Perret/publication/7878727_Arginine_magic_with_new_counterions_up_the_sleeve/links/00b7d5216831ea0f2c000000.pdf,0,0,0

A complete thermodynamic characterization of the binding process. which includes the enthalpies and entropies of complexation. is obviously one of the key elements in identifying the stabilizing factors and in understanding how the host and guest assemble. In order to thermodynamically characterize typical interactions of various types. we have thus undertaken a microcalorimetric study of the complexation of p-sulfonatocalixarenes with simple guests bearing different functional groups. Association constants. free energies. enthalpies and entropies for the complexation of the p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene with normal alcohols. alkylammonium. carboxylate and guanidinium ions in water. at pH 7.5 and 298.15 K. are reported.

SRGAP2. a gene recently implicated in neocortical development. has undergone two human-specific duplications. Here. we find that both duplications (SRGAP2B and SRGAP2C) are partial and encode a truncated F-BAR domain. SRGAP2C is expressed in the developing and adult human brain and dimerizes with ancestral SRGAP2 to inhibit its function. In the mouse neocortex. SRGAP2 promotes spine maturation and limits spine density. Expression of SRGAP2C phenocopies SRGAP2 deficiency.

However. at this point. the molecular mechanisms patterning the topography of TC projections in the VTel remains poorly understood. Here. we show that a long-range. high-rostral to low-caudal gradient of Netrin-1 in the VTel is required in vivo for the topographic sorting of TC axons to distinct cortical domains. We demonstrate that Netrin-1 is a chemoattractant for rostral thalamic axons but functions as a chemorepulsive cue for caudal thalamic axons. In accordance with this model. DCC is expressed in a high-rostromedial to low-caudolateral gradient in the dorsal thalamus (DTh). whereas three Unc5 receptors (Unc5A–C) show graded expression in the reverse orientation. Finally. we show that DCC is required for the attraction of rostromedial thalamic axons to the Netrin-1–rich. anterior part of the VTel. whereas DCC and Unc5A/C receptors are required for the repulsion of caudolateral TC axons from the same Netrin-1–rich region of the VTel.

Upon store depletion. STIM1. a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). aggregates and relocates close to the plasma membrane (PM) where it activates store-operated calcium channels (SOCs).

Of the four WNK isoforms. much of the focus has been on WNK1. which is activated in response to osmotic stress by phosphorylation of its T-loop residue (Ser382). WNK isoforms phosphorylate and activate the related SPAK (SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) protein kinases. In the present study. we first describe the generation of double-knockin ES (embryonic stem) cells. where SPAK and OSR1 cannot be activated by WNK1. We establish that NKCC1 (Na+/K+/2Cl− co-transporter 1). a proposed target of the WNK pathway. is not phosphorylated or activated in a knockin that is deficient in SPAK/OSR1 activity.

However. two major challenges may lead to widening the “biotechnological gap” between the developing and the industrial world; first the unaffordability of some current technologies for poorer countries. and second the necessity of analyzing all described alleles for every clinical case due to the inability to predict the ethnic group of a given patient. Because of its role in the metabolism of a number of drugs. cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an excellent candidate for use in the optimization of drug therapy.
