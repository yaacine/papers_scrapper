The classic RNN-based approaches to MT were first out-performed by the convolutional seq2seq model. which was then out-performed by the more recent Transformer model. Each of these new approaches consists of a fundamental architecture accompanied by a set of modeling and training techniques that are in principle applicable to other seq2seq architectures. In this paper. we tease apart the new architectures and their accompanying techniques in two ways. First. we identify several key modeling and training techniques. and apply them to the RNN architecture. yielding a new RNMT+ model that outperforms all of the three fundamental architectures on the benchmark WMT'14 English to French and English to German tasks.

But for each problem. getting a deep model to work well involves research into the architecture and a long period of tuning. We present a single model that yields good results on a number of problems spanning multiple domains. In particular. this single model is trained concurrently on ImageNet. multiple translation tasks. image captioning (COCO dataset). a speech recognition corpus. and an English parsing task. Our model architecture incorporates building blocks from multiple domains. It contains convolutional layers. an attention mechanism. and sparsely-gated layers. Each of these computational blocks is crucial for a subset of the tasks we train on. Interestingly. even if a block is not crucial for a task. we observe that adding it never hurts performance and in most cases improves it on all tasks.

Recent approaches have argued for going beyond convolutions in order to capture long-range dependencies. These efforts focus on augmenting convolutional models with content-based interactions. such as self-attention and non-local means. to achieve gains on a number of vision tasks. The natural question that arises is whether attention can be a stand-alone primitive for vision models instead of serving as just an augmentation on top of convolutions. In developing and testing a pure self-attention vision model. we verify that self-attention can indeed be an effective stand-alone layer. A simple procedure of replacing all instances of spatial convolutions with a form of self-attention applied to ResNet model produces a fully self-attentional model that outperforms the baseline on ImageNet classification with 12% fewer FLOPS and 29% fewer parameters. On COCO object detection. a pure self-attention model matches the mAP of a baseline RetinaNet while having 39% fewer FLOPS and 34% fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate that self-attention is especially impactful when used in later layers. These results establish that stand-alone self-attention is an important addition to the vision practitioner's toolbox.,True,fpJHNQ8AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,186,https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05909,16072663067784939588,/scholar?cites=16072663067784939588,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05909,0,0,0

Using both large-scale. observational social-media analyses and behavioral lab experiments. the authors investigated which types of moral similarities influence tie formations. Analysis of a corpus of over 700.000 tweets revealed that the distance between 2 people in a social-network can be predicted based on differences in the moral purity content—but not other moral content—of their messages.

Fuzzy models can effectively integrate information from different sources. such as physical laws. empirical models. measurements and heuristics. Application areas of fuzzy models include prediction. decision support. system analysis. control design. etc. Fuzzy Modeling for Control addresses fuzzy modeling from the systems and control engineering points of view. It focuses on the selection of appropriate model structures. on the acquisition of dynamic fuzzy models from process measurements (fuzzy identification). and on the design of nonlinear controllers based on fuzzy models. To automatically generate fuzzy models from measurements. a comprehensive methodology is developed which employs fuzzy clustering techniques to partition the available data into subsets characterized by locally linear behaviour. The relationships between the presented identification method and linear regression are exploited. allowing for the combination of fuzzy logic techniques with standard system identification tools. Attention is paid to the trade-off between the accuracy and transparency of the obtained fuzzy models. Control design based on a fuzzy model of a nonlinear dynamic process is addressed. using the concepts of model-based predictive control and internal model control with an inverted fuzzy model. To this end. methods to exactly invert specific types of fuzzy models are presented. In the context of predictive control. branch-and-bound optimization is applied.

1275871,Neuro-fuzzy methods for nonlinear system identification,2003,Robert Babuška and Henk Verbruggen,27,,1,73-85,Pergamon,Most processes in industry are characterized by nonlinear and time-varying behavior. Nonlinear system identification is becoming an important tool which can be used to improve control performance and achieve robust fault-tolerant behavior. Among the different nonlinear identification techniques. methods based on neuro-fuzzy models are gradually becoming established not only in the academia but also in industrial applications. Neuro-fuzzy modeling can be regarded as a gray-box technique on the boundary between neural networks and qualitative fuzzy models. The tools for building neuro-fuzzy models are based on combinations of algorithms from the fields of neural networks. pattern recognition and regression analysis.

First. it is shown how the antecedent fuzzy sets and the corresponding consequent parameters of the TS model can be derived from clusters obtained by the Gath-Geva (GG) algorithm. To preserve the partitioning of the antecedent space. linearly transformed input variables can be used in the model. This may. however. complicate the interpretation of the rules. To form an easily interpretable model that does not use the transformed input variables. a new clustering algorithm is proposed. based on the expectation-maximization (EM) identification of Gaussian mixture models.

The interest in fuzzy systems has recently shifted from the seminal ideas about complexity reduction toward data-driven construction of fuzzy systems. Many algorithms have been introduced that aim at numerical approximation of functions by rules. but pay little attention to the interpretability of the resulting rule base. We show that fuzzy rule-based models acquired from measurements can be both accurate and transparent by using a low number of rules. The rules are generated by product-space clustering and describe the system in terms of the characteristic local behavior of the system in regions identified by the clustering algorithm. The fuzzy transition between rules makes it possible to achieve precision along with a good qualitative description in linguistic terms.

The method is to train a matrix projecting from posteriors of Gaussians to a normal size feature space. and then to add the projected features to normal features such as PLP. The matrix is trained from a zero start using a linear method. Sparsity of posteriors ensures speed in both training and test time.

Studies on the perception of speech by human listeners suggest that recognizer robustness might be improved by focusing on temporal structure in the speech signal that appears as low-frequency (below 16 Hz) amplitude modulations in subband channels following critical-band frequency analysis. A speech representation that emphasizes this temporal structure. the “modulation spectrogram”. has been developed.

Cham,The success of machine learning in a broad range of applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used off the shelf by non-experts. To be effective in practice. such systems need to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature preprocessing steps for a new dataset at hand. and also set their respective hyperparameters. Recent work has started to tackle this automated machine learning (AutoML) problem with the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods. Building on this. we introduce a robust new AutoML system based on the Python machine learning package scikit-learn (using 15 classifiers. 14 feature preprocessing methods. and 4 data preprocessing methods. giving rise to a structured hypothesis space with 110 hyperparameters).

Rather than following the traditional approach of choosing the best solver for a given class of instances. we advocate making this decision online on a per-instance basis. Building on previous work. we describe SATzilla. an automated approach for constructing per-instance algorithm portfolios for SAT that use so-called empirical hardness models to choose among their constituent solvers. This approach takes as input a distribution of problem instances and a set of component solvers. and constructs a portfolio optimizing a given objective function (such as mean runtime. percent of instances solved. or score in a competition). The excellent performance of SATzilla was independently verified in the 2007 SAT Competition. where our SATzilla07 solvers won three gold. one silver and one bronze medal. In this article. we go well beyond SATzilla07 by making the portfolio construction scalable and completely automated. and improving it by integrating local search solvers as candidate solvers. by predicting performance score instead of runtime. and by using hierarchical hardness models that take into account different types of SAT instances.

This suggests a two-stage learning procedure that first learns a large net and then prunes away connections or hidden units. But standard training does not necessarily encourage nets to be amenable to pruning. We introduce targeted dropout. a method for training a neural network so that it is robust to subsequent pruning. Before computing the gradients for each weight update. targeted dropout stochastically selects a set of units or weights to be dropped using a simple self-reinforcing sparsity criterion and then computes the gradients for the remaining weights. The resulting network is robust to post hoc pruning of weights or units that frequently occur in the dropped sets.

1275912,ProxylessNAS: Direct Neural Architecture Search on Target Task and Hardware,2018,Han Cai and Ligeng Zhu and Song Han,,,,,,Neural architecture search (NAS) has a great impact by automatically designing effective neural network architectures. However. the prohibitive computational demand of conventional NAS algorithms (eg  GPU hours) makes it difficult to\emph {directly} search the architectures on large-scale tasks (eg ImageNet). Differentiable NAS can reduce the cost of GPU hours via a continuous representation of network architecture but suffers from the high GPU memory consumption issue (grow linearly wrt candidate set size). As a result. they need to utilize~\emph {proxy} tasks. such as training on a smaller dataset. or learning with only a few blocks. or training just for a few epochs. These architectures optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. In this paper. we present\emph {ProxylessNAS} that can\emph {directly} learn the architectures for large-scale target tasks and target hardware platforms. We address the high memory consumption issue of differentiable NAS and reduce the computational cost (GPU hours and GPU memory) to the same level of regular training while still allowing a large candidate set. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of directness and specialization. On CIFAR-10. our model achieves 2.08\% test error with only 5.7 M parameters. better than the previous state-of-the-art architecture AmoebaNet-B. while using 6 fewer parameters.

However. the deployment of large neural networks models can be difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited power budgets. To solve this problem. we propose Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ). a method that can reduce the precision of weights in neural networks to ternary values. This method has very little accuracy degradation and can even improve the accuracy of some models (32. 44. 56-layer ResNet) on CIFAR-10 and AlexNet on ImageNet. And our AlexNet model is trained from scratch. which means it's as easy as to train normal full precision model. We highlight our trained quantization method that can learn both ternary values and ternary assignment. During inference. only ternary values (2-bit weights) and scaling factors are needed. therefore our models are nearly 16x smaller than full-precision models. Our ternary models can also be viewed as sparse binary weight networks. which can potentially be accelerated with custom circuit. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the ternary models obtained by trained quantization method outperform full-precision models of ResNet-32. 44. 56 by 0.04%. 0.16%. 0.36%. respectively. On ImageNet. our model outperforms full-precision AlexNet model by 0.3% of Top-1 accuracy and outperforms previous ternary models by 3%.,True,E0iCaa4AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,720,https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01064,12956735651240747861,/scholar?cites=12956735651240747861,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01064,0,0,0

1275915,Deep gradient compression: Reducing the communication bandwidth for distributed training,2017,Yujun Lin and Song Han and Huizi Mao and Yu Wang and William J Dally,,,,,,Large-scale distributed training requires significant communication bandwidth for gradient exchange that limits the scalability of multi-node training. and requires expensive high-bandwidth network infrastructure. The situation gets even worse with distributed training on mobile devices (federated learning). which suffers from higher latency. lower throughput. and intermittent poor connections. In this paper. we find 99.9% of the gradient exchange in distributed SGD is redundant. and propose Deep Gradient Compression (DGC) to greatly reduce the communication bandwidth. To preserve accuracy during compression. DGC employs four methods: momentum correction. local gradient clipping. momentum factor masking. and warm-up training. We have applied Deep Gradient Compression to image classification. speech recognition. and language modeling with multiple datasets including Cifar10. ImageNet. Penn Treebank. and Librispeech Corpus. On these scenarios. Deep Gradient Compression achieves a gradient compression ratio from 270x to 600x without losing accuracy. cutting the gradient size of ResNet-50 from 97MB to 0.35 MB. and for DeepSpeech from 488MB to 0.74 MB.

Conventional 2D CNNs are computationally cheap but cannot capture temporal relationships; 3D CNN based methods can achieve good performance but are computationally intensive. making it expensive to deploy. In this paper. we propose a generic and effective Temporal Shift Module (TSM) that enjoys both high efficiency and high performance. Specifically. it can achieve the performance of 3D CNN but maintain 2D CNN's complexity. TSM shifts part of the channels along the temporal dimension; thus facilitate information exchanged among neighboring frames. It can be inserted into 2D CNNs to achieve temporal modeling at zero computation and zero parameters. We also extended TSM to online setting. which enables real-time low-latency online video recognition and video object detection. TSM is accurate and efficient: it ranks the first place on the Something-Something leaderboard upon publication; on Jetson Nano and Galaxy Note8. it achieves a low latency of 13ms and 35ms for online video recognition.

Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to support mixed precision (1-8 bits) to further improve the computation efficiency. which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading off among accuracy. latency. energy. and model size. which is both time-consuming and sub-optimal. There are plenty of specialized hardware for neural networks. but little research has been done for specialized neural network optimization for a particular hardware architecture. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way. In this paper. we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ) framework which leverages the reinforcement learning to automatically determine the quantization policy. and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size. we employ a hardware simulator to generate direct feedback signals (latency and energy) to the RL agent. Compared with conventional methods. our framework is fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural network architectures and hardware architectures.

Most recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering. However. this approach suffers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available. so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper. we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation. and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks. and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations. despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal.

Efficient sampling for this class of models at the cost of little to no loss in quality has however remained an elusive problem. With a focus on text-to-speech synthesis. we describe a set of general techniques for reducing sampling time while maintaining high output quality. We first describe a single-layer recurrent neural network. the WaveRNN. with a dual softmax layer that matches the quality of the state-of-the-art WaveNet model. The compact form of the network makes it possible to generate 24 kHz 16-bit audio 4 times faster than real time on a GPU. Secondly. we apply a weight pruning technique to reduce the number of weights in the WaveRNN. We find that. for a constant number of parameters. large sparse networks perform better than small dense networks and this relationship holds past sparsity levels of more than 96%. The small number of weights in a Sparse WaveRNN makes it possible to sample high-fidelity audio on a mobile phone CPU in real time. Finally. we describe a new dependency scheme for sampling that lets us trade a constant number of non-local. distant dependencies for the ability to generate samples in batches.

Information filtering (IF) focuses on the analysis of item content and the development of a personal user interest profile. Collaborative filtering (CF) focuses on identification of other users with similar tastes and the use of their opinions to recommend items. Each technique has advantages and limitations that suggest that the two could be beneficially combined.This paper shows that a CF framework can be used to combine personal IF agents and the opinions of a community of users to produce better recommendations than either agents or users can produce alone. It also shows that using CF to create a personal combination of a set of agents produces better results than either individual agents or other combination mechanisms.

In this work. we propose a new face anti-spoofing method based on color texture analysis. We analyze the joint color-texture information from the luminance and the chrominance channels using a color local binary pattern descriptor. More specifically. the feature histograms are extracted from each image band separately. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. namely CASIA face anti-spoofing and Replay-Attack databases. showed excellent results compared to the state-of-the-art.

As in other fields of AI. deep learning-based end-to-end approaches have made great advances in program synthesis.

While execution traces can provide highly detailed guidance for a program synthesis method. they are more difficult to obtain than more basic forms of specification such as input/output pairs.

I/O device virtualization models in virtual machine (VM) environments require involvement of a virtual machine monitor (VMM) and/or a privileged VM for each I/O operation. which may turn out to be a performance bottleneck for systems with high I/O demands. especially those equipped with modern high speed interconnects such as InfiniBand. In this paper. we propose a new device virtualization model called VMM-bypass I/O. which extends the idea of OS-bypass originated from user-level communication. Essentially. VMM-bypass allows time-critical I/O operations to be carried out directly in guest VMs without involvement of the VMM and/or a privileged VM. By exploiting the intelligence found in modern high speed network interfaces. VMM-bypass can significantly improve I/O and communication performance for VMs without sacrificing safety or isolation. To demonstrate the idea of VMM-bypass. we have developed a prototype called Xen-IB. which offers Infini-Band virtualization support in the Xen 3.0 VM environment. Xen-IB runs with current InfiniBand hardware and does not require modifications to existing user-level applications or kernel-level drivers that use InfiniBand.

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation. and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model.

1275975,On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder-Decoder Approaches,2014,Kyunghyun Cho and Bart van Merriënboer and Dzmitry Bahdanau and Yoshua Bengio,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.1259,,,,Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence. and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper. we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words. but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore. we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.,True,XE9SDzgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,3733,https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1259,5003296211736798080,/scholar?cites=5003296211736798080,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1259,0,0,0

Given a set of examples. we train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform the above estimation task. Different from other learning methods. the CNNs learn both spatial and temporal features jointly from image pairs of two adjacent frames. We introduce multiple path ways in CNN to better fuse local and global information. A creative shift-variant CNN architecture is designed so as to alleviate the drift problem when the distracting objects are similar to the target in cluttered environment. Furthermore. we employ CNNs to estimate the scale through the accurate localization of some key points. These techniques are object-independent so that the proposed method can be applied to track other types of object.

1275995,End-to-end Learning of Semantic Role Labeling Using Recurrent Neural Networks,2015,Jie Zhou and Wei Xu,,Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers),,1127-1137,Association for Computational Linguistics,Semantic role labeling (SRL) is one of the basic natural language processing (NLP) problems. To this date. most of the successful SRL systems were built on top of some form of parsing results (Koomen et al.. 2005; Palmer et al.. 2010; Pradhan et al.. 2013). where pre-defined feature templates over the syntactic structure are used. The attempts of building an end-to-end SRL learning system without using parsing were less successful (Collobert et al.. 2011). In this work. we propose to use deep bi-directional recurrent network as an end-to-end system for SRL. We take only original text information as input feature. without using any syntactic knowledge. The proposed algorithm for semantic role labeling was mainly evaluated on CoNLL-2005 shared task and achieved F1 score of 81.07. This result outperforms the previous state-of-the-art system from the combination of different parsing trees or models. We also obtained the same conclusion with F1= 81.27 on CoNLL-2012 shared task. As a result of simplicity. our model is also computationally efficient that the parsing speed is 6.7 k tokens per second. Our analysis shows that our model is better at handling longer sentences than traditional models. And the latent variables of our model implicitly capture the syntactic structure of a sentence.,True,Gxz1fqwAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,344,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-1109.pdf,13655474225729803169,/scholar?cites=13655474225729803169,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-1109.pdf,0,0,0

Indeed. much progress has been made on benchmark datasets like NORB and CIFAR-10 by employing increasingly complex unsupervised learning algorithms and deep models.

We then present a detailed analysis of the effect of changes in the model setup: the receptive field size. number of hidden nodes (features). the step-size (“stride”) between extracted features. and the effect of whitening. Our results show that large numbers of hidden nodes and dense feature extraction are critical to achieving high performance-so critical. in fact. that when these parameters are pushed to their limits. we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both CIFAR-10 and NORB using only a single layer of features.

Then. using only simple off-the-shelf methods. we integrate these two modules into a full end-to-end. lexicon-driven. scene text recognition system that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. namely Street View Text and ICDAR 2003.,True,bLUllHEAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,907,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6460871/,10277739624113789727,/scholar?cites=10277739624113789727,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.664.6212&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This paper presents the ﬁrst successful autonomous completion on a real RC helicopter of the following four aerobatic maneuvers: forward ﬂip and sideways roll at low speed. tail-in funnel. and nose-in funnel. Our experimental results signiﬁcantly extend the state of the art in autonomous helicopter ﬂight.

Then we used a reinforcement learning (optimal control) algorithm to ﬁnd a controller that is optimized for the resulting model and reward function.

1276016,The importance of encoding versus training with sparse coding and vector quantization,2011,Adam Coates and Andrew Y Ng,,,,,,While vector quantization (VQ) has been applied widely to generate features for visual recognition problems. much recent work has focused on more powerful methods. In particular. sparse coding has emerged as a strong alternative to traditional VQ approaches and has been shown to achieve consistently higher performance on benchmark datasets. Both approaches can be split into a training phase. where the system learns a dictionary of basis functions. and an encoding phase. where the dictionary is used to extract features from new inputs. In this work. we investigate the reasons for the success of sparse coding over VQ by decoupling these phases. allowing us to separate out the contributions of training and encoding in a controlled way. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR. NORB and Caltech 101 datasets. we compare several training and encoding schemes. including sparse coding and a form of VQ with a soft threshold activation function. Our results show not only that we can use fast VQ algorithms for training. but that we can just as well use randomly chosen exemplars from the training set. Rather than spend resources on training. we find it is more important to choose a good encoder—which can often be a simple feed forward non-linearity. Our results include state-of-the-art performance on both CIFAR and NORB.,True,bLUllHEAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,704,https://openreview.net/forum?id=By4afoWO-B,2163670635562728156,/scholar?cites=2163670635562728156,,,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=By4afoWO-B,0,0,0

Heidelberg,Many algorithms are available to learn deep hierarchies of features from unlabeled data. especially images. In many cases. these algorithms involve multi-layered networks of features (e.g.. neural networks) that are sometimes tricky to train and tune and are difficult to scale up to many machines effectively. Recently. it has been found that K-means clustering can be used as a fast alternative training method. The main advantage of this approach is that it is very fast and easily implemented at large scale. On the other hand. employing this method in practice is not completely trivial: K-means has several limitations. and care must be taken to combine the right ingredients to get the system to work well.

In the last two decades. a huge number of methods were proposed to deal with the hyperspectral data classification problem. However. most of them do not hierarchically extract deep features.

With the resurgence of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). several end-to-end deep Siamese CNN architectures have been proposed for human re-identification with the objective of projecting the images of similar pairs (i.e. same identity) to be closer to each other and those of dissimilar pairs to be distant from each other. However. current networks extract fixed representations for each image regardless of other images which are paired with it and the comparison with other images is done only at the final level.

Although the unmatched expressiveness of the many layers can be highly desirable at test time. training very deep networks comes with its own set of challenges. The gradients can vanish. the forward flow often diminishes. and the training time can be painfully slow. To address these problems. we propose stochastic depth. a training procedure that enables the seemingly contradictory setup to train short networks and use deep networks at test time. We start with very deep networks but during training. for each mini-batch. randomly drop a subset of layers and bypass them with the identity function.

In this paper. we propose a novel learning scheme for CNNs to simultaneously 1) reduce the model size; 2) decrease the run-time memory footprint; and 3) lower the number of computing operations. without compromising accuracy. This is achieved by enforcing channel-level sparsity in the network in a simple but effective way. Different from many existing approaches. the proposed method directly applies to modern CNN architectures. introduces minimum overhead to the training process. and requires no special software/hardware accelerators for the resulting models. We call our approach network slimming. which takes wide and large networks as input models. but during training insignificant channels are automatically identified and pruned afterwards. yielding thin and compact models with comparable accuracy. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several state-of-the-art CNN models. including VGGNet. ResNet and DenseNet. on various image classification datasets.

A typical pruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline. ie. training (a large model). pruning and fine-tuning.

In this work. we make several surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. For all state-of-the-art structured pruning algorithms we examined. fine-tuning a pruned model only gives comparable or worse performance than training that model with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a predefined target network architecture. one can get rid of the full pipeline and directly train the target network from scratch.

1276044,Dsod: Learning deeply supervised object detectors from scratch,2017,Zhiqiang Shen* and Zhuang Liu* and Jianguo Li and Yu-Gang Jiang and Yurong Chen and Xiangyang Xue,,,,1919-1927,,We present Deeply Supervised Object Detector (DSOD). a framework that can learn object detectors from scratch. State-of-the-art object objectors rely heavily on the off-the-shelf networks pre-trained on large-scale classification datasets like ImageNet. which incurs learning bias due to the difference on both the loss functions and the category distributions between classification and detection tasks. Model fine-tuning for the detection task could alleviate this bias to some extent but not fundamentally. Besides. transferring pre-trained models from classification to detection between discrepant domains is even more difficult (eg RGB to depth images). A better solution to tackle these two critical problems is to train object detectors from scratch. which motivates our proposed DSOD. Previous efforts in this direction mostly failed due to much more complicated loss functions and limited training data in object detection. In DSOD. we contribute a set of design principles for training object detectors from scratch. One of the key findings is that deep supervision. enabled by dense layer-wise connections. plays a critical role in learning a good detector. Combining with several other principles. we develop DSOD following the single-shot detection (SSD) framework. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007. 2012 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that DSOD can achieve better results than the state-of-the-art solutions with much more compact models. For instance.

However. training multiple deep networks for model averaging is computationally expensive. In this paper. we propose a method to obtain the seemingly contradictory goal of ensembling multiple neural networks at no additional training cost. We achieve this goal by training a single neural network. converging to several local minima along its optimization path and saving the model parameters. To obtain repeated rapid convergence. we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules. The resulting technique. which we refer to as Snapshot Ensembling. is simple. yet surprisingly effective. We show in a series of experiments that our approach is compatible with diverse network architectures and learning tasks.

In this work we develop a few-shot object detector that can learn to detect novel objects from only a few annotated examples. Our proposed model leverages fully labeled base classes and quickly adapts to novel classes. using a meta feature learner and a reweighting module within a one-stage detection architecture. The feature learner extracts meta features that are generalizable to detect novel object classes. using training data from base classes with sufficient samples. The reweighting module transforms a few support examples from the novel classes to a global vector that indicates the importance or relevance of meta features for detecting the corresponding objects. These two modules. together with a detection prediction module. are trained end-to-end based on an episodic few-shot learning scheme and a carefully designed loss function.

This is in contrast to the common approach to reinforcement learning which models the expectation of this return. or value. Although there is an established body of literature studying the value distribution. thus far it has always been used for a specific purpose such as implementing risk-aware behaviour. We begin with theoretical results in both the policy evaluation and control settings. exposing a significant distributional instability in the latter. We then use the distributional perspective to design a new algorithm which applies Bellman’s equation to the learning of approximate value distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the Arcade Learning Environment.

X. is allowed to be a generic measurable space and the mean-payoff function is “locally Lipschitz” with respect to a dissimilarity function that is known to the decision maker. Under this condition we construct an arm selection policy. called HOO (hierarchical optimistic optimization). with improved regret bounds compared to previous results for a large class of problems. In particular. our results imply that if X is the unit hypercube in a Euclidean space and the mean-payoff function has a finite number of global maxima around which the behavior of the function is locally continuous with a known smoothness degree. then the expected regret of HOO is bounded up to a logarithmic factor by√ n. that is. the rate of growth of the regret is independent of the dimension of the space. We also prove the minimax optimality of our algorithm when the dissimilarity is a metric. Our basic strategy has quadratic computational complexity as a function of the number of time steps and does not rely on the doubling trick.

The regret of a forecaster is here defined by the gap between the mean reward of the optimal arm and the mean reward of the ultimately chosen arm. We propose a highly exploring UCB policy and a new algorithm based on successive rejects. We show that these algorithms are essentially optimal since their regret decreases exponentially at a rate which is. up to a logarithmic factor. the best possible. However. while the UCB policy needs the tuning of a parameter depending on the unobservable hardness of the task. the successive rejects policy benefits from being parameter-free. and also independent of the scaling of the rewards. As a by-product of our analysis. we show that identifying the best arm (when it is unique) requires a number of samples of order (up to a log (K) factor) Pi 1/∆ 2 i. where the sum is on the suboptimal arms and∆ i represents the difference between the mean reward of the best arm and the one of arm i.

This paper considers a variant of the basic algorithm for the stochastic. multi-armed bandit problem that takes into account the empirical variance of the different arms. In earlier experimental works. such algorithms were found to outperform the competing algorithms. We provide the first analysis of the expected regret for such algorithms.

However. a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge. which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm. but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second. quite separate RL procedure. This second. learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly. because it is learned. it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments. each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach. and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.,True,OvKEnVwAAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC,447,https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05763,2635837800726039837,/scholar?cites=2635837800726039837,,,"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05763.pdf),",0,0,0

Because the mode of action of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis is not well established. recent dose-response assessments for arsenic have assumed linearity at low doses despite evidence that arsenic is not a direct-acting mutagen.

Inference consists in clamping the value of observed variables and finding configurations of the remaining variables that minimize the energy. Learning consists in finding an energy function in which observed configurations of the variables are given lower energies than unobserved ones. The EBM approach provides a common theoretical framework for many learning models. including traditional discriminative and generative approaches. as well as graph-transformer networks. conditional random fields. maximum margin Markov networks. and several manifold learning methods. Probabilistic models must be properly normalized. which sometimes requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all possible variable configurations. Since EBMs have no requirement for proper normalization. this problem is naturally circumvented. EBMs can be viewed as a form of non-probabilistic factor graphs. and they provide considerably more flexibility in the design of architectures and training criteria than probabilistic approaches.,True,ETU-ePAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,731,http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/orig/lecun-06.pdf,8819502341081664768,/scholar?cites=8819502341081664768,,,http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/orig/lecun-06.pdf,0,0,0

Unlike standard language modelling benchmarks. it distinguishes the task of predicting syntactic function words from that of predicting lower-frequency words. which carry greater semantic content. We compare a range of state-of-the-art models. each with a different way of encoding what has been previously read. We show that models which store explicit representations of long-term contexts outperform state-of-the-art neural language models at predicting semantic content words. although this advantage is not observed for syntactic function words. Interestingly. we find that the amount of text encoded in a single memory representation is highly influential to the performance: there is a sweet-spot. not too big and not too small. between single words and full sentences that allows the most meaningful information in a text to be effectively retained and recalled. Further. the attention over such window-based memories can be trained effectively through self-supervision. We then assess the generality of this principle by applying it to the CNN QA benchmark. which involves identifying named entities in paraphrased summaries of news articles. and achieve state-of-the-art performance.,True,ETU-ePAAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,472,https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02301,14633685640258770614,/scholar?cites=14633685640258770614,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02301,0,0,0
1276095,Unsupervised salience learning for person re-identification,2013,Rui Zhao and Wanli Ouyang and Xiaogang Wang,,,,3586-3593,,Human eyes can recognize person identities based on some small salient regions. However. such valuable salient information is often hidden when computing similarities of images with existing approaches. Moreover. many existing approaches learn discriminative features and handle drastic viewpoint change in a supervised way and require labeling new training data for a different pair of camera views. In this paper. we propose a novel perspective for person re-identification based on unsupervised salience learning. Distinctive features are extracted without requiring identity labels in the training procedure. First. we apply adjacency constrained patch matching to build dense correspondence between image pairs. which shows effectiveness in handling misalignment caused by large viewpoint and pose variations.

1276096,Visual tracking with fully convolutional networks,2015,Lijun Wang and Wanli Ouyang and Xiaogang Wang and Huchuan Lu,,,,3119-3127,,We propose a new approach for general object tracking with fully convolutional neural network. Instead of treating convolutional neural network (CNN) as a black-box feature extractor. we conduct in-depth study on the properties of CNN features offline pre-trained on massive image data and classification task on ImageNet. The discoveries motivate the design of our tracking system. It is found that convolutional layers in different levels characterize the target from different perspectives. A top layer encodes more semantic features and serves as a category detector. while a lower layer carries more discriminative information and can better separate the target from distracters with similar appearance. Both layers are jointly used with a switch mechanism during tracking. It is also found that for a tracking target. only a subset of neurons are relevant. A feature map selection method is developed to remove noisy and irrelevant feature maps. which can reduce computation redundancy and improve tracking accuracy.

It is well motivated by our study on what are good filters for person re-identification. Our mid-level filters are discriminatively learned for identifying specific visual patterns and distinguishing persons. and have good cross-view invariance. First. local patches are qualitatively measured and classified with their discriminative power. Discriminative and representative patches are collected for filter learning. Second. patch clusters with coherent appearance are obtained by pruning hierarchical clustering trees. and a simple but effective cross-view training strategy is proposed to learn filters that are view-invariant and discriminative.

We adopt stacked hourglass networks to generate attention maps from features at multiple resolutions with various semantics. The Conditional Random Field (CRF) is utilized to model the correlations among neighboring regions in the attention map. We further combine the holistic attention model. which focuses on the global consistency of the full human body. and the body part attention model. which focuses on detailed descriptions for different body parts. Hence our model has the ability to focus on different granularity from local salient regions to global semantic consistent spaces. Additionally. we design novel Hourglass Residual Units (HRUs) to increase the receptive field of the network. These units are extensions of residual units with a side branch incorporating filters with larger receptive field. hence features with various scales are learned and combined within the HRUs. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-context attention mechanism and the hourglass residual units is evaluated on two widely used human pose estimation benchmarks.

This issue will also impact the scale and diversity of applications that are able to be supported. We contrast two end-points of the spectrum of conscious human involvement. namely participatory sensing. and opportunistic sensing. We develop an evaluation model and argue that opportunistic sensing more easily supports larger scale applications and broader diversity within such applications. In this paper. we provide preliminary analysis which supports this conjecture. and outline techniques we are developing in support of opportunistic sensing systems.,True,IleoLUgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,370,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1411759.1411763,11963418821325736725,/scholar?cites=11963418821325736725,,,https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sensorlab/pubs/ovp_extended.pdf,0,0,0

When the scaling ratio is small. point estimates achieve impressive performance. but soon they suffer from the regression-to-the-mean problem. result of their inability to capture the multi-modality of this conditional distribution. Modeling high-dimensional image and audio distributions is a hard task. requiring both the ability to model complex geometrical structures and textured regions. In this paper. we propose to use as conditional model a Gibbs distribution. where its sufficient statistics are given by deep convolutional neural networks. The features computed by the network are stable to local deformation. and have reduced variance when the input is a stationary texture. These properties imply that the resulting sufficient statistics minimize the uncertainty of the target signals given the degraded observations. while being highly informative. The filters of the CNN are initialized by multiscale complex wavelets. and then we propose an algorithm to fine-tune them by estimating the gradient of the conditional log-likelihood. which bears some similarities with Generative Adversarial Networks.

Our theoretical work quantifies and formalizes two important\emph {folklore} facts:(i) the landscape of deep linear networks has a radically different topology from that of deep half-rectified ones. and (ii) that the energy landscape in the non-linear case is fundamentally controlled by the interplay between the smoothness of the data distribution and model over-parametrization. Our main theoretical contribution is to prove that half-rectified single layer networks are asymptotically connected. and we provide explicit bounds that reveal the aforementioned interplay.,True,L4bNmsMAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC,142,https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01540,5710196688640567330,/scholar?cites=5710196688640567330,,,"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01540.pdf,",0,0,0

In contrast to the short and transient activation of NF-κB in vitro. we observed a long-lasting sustained activation of NF-κB in the absence of decreased IκBα in mononuclear cells from patients with type 1 diabetes. This was associated with increased transcription of NF-κBp65. A comparable increase in NF-κBp65 antigen and mRNA was also observed in vascular endothelial cells of diabetic rats. As a mechanism. we propose that binding of ligands such as advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). members of the S100 family. or amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) to the transmembrane receptor for AGE (RAGE) results in protein synthesis–dependent sustained activation of NF-κB both in vitro and in vivo.

1276150,How transferable are features in deep neural networks?,2014,Jason Yosinski and Jeff Clune and Yoshua Bengio and Hod Lipson,,,,9,,Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task. but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network. but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues:(1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task. which was expected. and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons. which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet. we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate. depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom. middle. or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases. but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.,True,5TZ7f5wAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,5761,https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1792,8833146761103838326,/scholar?cites=8833146761103838326,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1792,0,0,0

Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance. questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study revealed that changing an image (eg of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (eg mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans. but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99% confidence (eg labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically. we take convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects. which we call"" fooling images""(more generally. fooling examples).

However. our understanding of how these models work. especially what computations they perform at intermediate layers. has lagged behind. Progress in the field will be further accelerated by the development of better tools for visualizing and interpreting neural nets. We introduce two such tools here. The first is a tool that visualizes the activations produced on each layer of a trained convnet as it processes an image or video (eg a live webcam stream). We have found that looking at live activations that change in response to user input helps build valuable intuitions about how convnets work. The second tool enables visualizing features at each layer of a DNN via regularized optimization in image space. Because previous versions of this idea produced less recognizable images. here we introduce several new regularization methods that combine to produce qualitatively clearer. more interpretable visualizations.

1276157,Synthesizing the preferred inputs for neurons in neural networks via deep generator networks,2016,Anh Nguyen and Alexey Dosovitskiy and Jason Yosinski and Thomas Brox and Jeff Clune,,,,,,Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art results on many pattern recognition tasks. especially vision classification problems. Understanding the inner workings of such computational brains is both fascinating basic science that is interesting in its own right-similar to why we study the human brain-and will enable researchers to further improve DNNs. One path to understanding how a neural network functions internally is to study what each of its neurons has learned to detect. One such method is called activation maximization (AM). which synthesizes an input (eg an image) that highly activates a neuron. Here we dramatically improve the qualitative state of the art of activation maximization by harnessing a powerful. learned prior: a deep generator network (DGN). The algorithm (1) generates qualitatively state-of-the-art synthetic images that look almost real.(2) reveals the features learned by each neuron in an interpretable way.(3) generalizes well to new datasets and somewhat well to different network architectures without requiring the prior to be relearned. and (4) can be considered as a high-quality generative method (in this case. by generating novel. creative. interesting. recognizable images).,True,5TZ7f5wAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,429,https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09304,5242797434107730911,/scholar?cites=5242797434107730911,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.09304,0,0,0

1276160,Illuminating search spaces by mapping elites,2015,Jean-Baptiste Mouret and Jeff Clune,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.04909,,,,Many fields use search algorithms. which automatically explore a search space to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger. cheaper. safer designs. scientists search for models that best explain data. etc. The goal of search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new. fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm illuminates search spaces. allowing researchers to understand how interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance. either positively or. equally of interest. negatively. For example. a drug company may wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing. yet qualitatively different solutions. which can be more helpful than a single. high-performing solution. Interestingly. because MAP-Elites explores more of the search space. it also tends to find a better overall solution than state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots.

Large-scale consumption of electricity in a fraudulent manner may imbalance the demand-supply gap to a great extent. Thus. there arises the need to develop a scheme that can detect these thefts precisely in the complex power networks. So. keeping focus on these points. this paper proposes a comprehensive top-down scheme based on decision tree (DT) and support vector machine (SVM). Unlike existing schemes. the proposed scheme is capable enough to precisely detect and locate real-time electricity theft at every level in power transmission and distribution (T&D).

DeepId2]. implementing face verification and recognition efficiently at scale presents serious challenges to current approaches. In this paper we present a system. called FaceNet. that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity. Once this space has been produced. tasks such as face recognition. verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings as feature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself. rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous approaches. To train. we use triplets of roughly aligned matching/non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128 bytes per face.

Much work has endeavored to design and build architectures automatically through clever construction of a search space paired with simple learning algorithms. Recent progress has demonstrated that such meta-learning methods may exceed scalable human-invented architectures on image classification tasks. An open question is the degree to which such methods may generalize to new domains. In this work we explore the construction of meta-learning techniques for dense image prediction focused on the tasks of scene parsing. person-part segmentation. and semantic image segmentation. Constructing viable search spaces in this domain is challenging because of the multi-scale representation of visual information and the necessity to operate on high resolution imagery. Based on a survey of techniques in dense image prediction. we construct a recursive search space and demonstrate that even with efficient random search. we can identify architectures that outperform human-invented architectures and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three dense prediction tasks including 82.7\% on Cityscapes (street scene parsing). 71.3\% on PASCAL-Person-Part (person-part segmentation). and 87.9\% on PASCAL VOC 2012 (semantic image segmentation).

Because signals in our sensory and motor systems are corrupted by variability or noise. the nervous system needs to estimate these states. To select an optimal action these state estimates need to be combined with knowledge of the potential costs or rewards of different action outcomes. We review recent studies that have investigated the mechanisms used by the nervous system to solve such estimation and decision problems. which show that human behaviour is close to that predicted by Bayesian Decision Theory.

The brain should thus be able to efficiently infer the causes underlying our sensory events. Here we use multisensory cue combination to study causal inference in perception. We formulate an ideal-observer model that infers whether two sensory cues originate from the same location and that also estimates their location(s). This model accurately predicts the nonlinear integration of cues by human subjects in two auditory-visual localization tasks. The results show that indeed humans can efficiently infer the causal structure as well as the location of causes.

Such exponential growth motivates us to ask how data analysis techniques are affected by progressively larger numbers of recorded neurons. Traditionally. neurons are analyzed independently on the basis of their tuning to stimuli or movement. Although tuning curve approaches are unaffected by growing numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons. newly developed techniques that analyze interactions between neurons become more accurate and more complex as the number of recorded neurons increases. Emerging data analysis techniques should consider both the computational costs and the potential for more accurate models associated with this exponential growth of the number of recorded neurons.,True,MiFqJGcAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,490,https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2731,12643451368039350885,/scholar?cites=12643451368039350885,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3410539/,0,0,0

Toronto. Canada,Background: Depression is a common. burdensome. often recurring mental health disorder that frequently goes undetected and untreated. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms.Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors. and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity.Methods: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants. 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period. participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data.Results: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity. including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r=-. 63. P=. 005). normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r=-. 58. P=. 012). and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r=-. 58. P=. 012).

In machine learning. however. artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes. dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function. often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First. structured architectures are used. including dedicated systems for attention. recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second. cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions. (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development. and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses. we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry. and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system. enabled by a series of interacting cost functions. serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism.

Fast-timescale disturbances occur when muscles fatigue. Slow-timescale disturbances occur when muscles are damaged or when limb dynamics change as a result of development. To maintain performance. motor commands need to adapt. Computing the best adaptation in response to any performance error results in a credit assignment problem: which timescale is responsible for this disturbance? Here we show that a Bayesian solution to this problem accounts for numerous behaviors of animals during both short-and long-term training. Our analysis focused on characteristics of the oculomotor system during learning. including the effects of time passage.

Today's mainstream models simply assume that the nervous system adapts linearly and proportionally to errors. However. not all movement errors are relevant to our own action. The environment may transiently disturb the movement production—for example. a gust of wind blows the tennis ball away from its intended trajectory. Apparently the nervous system should not adapt its motor plan in the subsequent tennis strokes based on this irrelevant movement error. We hypothesize that the nervous system estimates the relevance of each observed error and adapts strongly only to relevant errors. Here we present a Bayesian treatment of this problem. The model calculates how likely an error is relevant to the motor plant and derives an ideal adaptation strategy that leads to the most precise movements.

1276214,Estimating the sources of motor errors for adaptation and generalization,2008,Max Berniker and Konrad Kording,11,Nature neuroscience,12,1454-1461,Nature Publishing Group,Motor adaptation is usually defined as the process by which our nervous system produces accurate movements while the properties of our bodies and our environment continuously change. Many experimental and theoretical studies have characterized this process by assuming that the nervous system uses internal models to compensate for motor errors. Here we extend these approaches and construct a probabilistic model that not only compensates for motor errors but estimates the sources of these errors. These estimates dictate how the nervous system should generalize. For example. estimated changes of limb properties will affect movements across the workspace but not movements with the other limb. We provide evidence that many movement-generalization phenomena emerge from a strategy by which the nervous system estimates the sources of our motor errors.,True,MiFqJGcAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,306,https://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v11/n12/full/nn.2229.html,5112922538351843326,/scholar?cites=5112922538351843326,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2707921/,0,0,0

The perception of our own body and more particularly our sense of body ownership is taken for granted. Nevertheless experimental findings from body ownership illusions (BOIs). show that under specific multisensory conditions. we can experience artificial body parts or fake bodies as our own body parts or body respectively. The aim of the present paper is to discuss how and why BOIs are induced. We review several experimental findings concerning the spatial. temporal and semantic principles of crossmodal stimuli that have been applied to induce BOIs. On the basis of these principles. we discuss theoretical approaches concerning the underlying mechanism of BOIs. We propose a conceptualization based on Bayesian causal inference for addressing how our nervous system could infer whether an object belongs to our own body. using multisensory. sensorimotor and semantic information. and we discuss how this can account for several experimental findings.

Our algorithm is multimodal (2D and 3D) and performs hybrid (feature based and holistic) matching in order to achieve efficiency and robustness to facial expressions. The pose of a 3D face along with its texture is automatically corrected using a novel approach based on a single automatically detected point and the Hotelling transform. A novel 3D spherical face representation (SFR) is used in conjunction with the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor to form a rejection classifier. which quickly eliminates a large number of candidate faces at an early stage for efficient recognition in case of large galleries. The remaining faces are then verified using a novel region-based matching approach. which is robust to facial expressions.

We present a novel 3D model-based algorithm which performs this task automatically and efficiently. A 3D model of an object is automatically constructed offline from its multiple unordered range images (views). These views are converted into multidimensional table representations (which we refer to as tensors). Correspondences are automatically established between these views by simultaneously matching the tensors of a view with those of the remaining views using a hash table-based voting scheme. This results in a graph of relative transformations used to register the views before they are integrated into a seamless 3D model. These models and their tensor representations constitute the model library.

Based on the used types of features. 3D object recognition methods can broadly be divided into two categories-global or local feature based methods. Intensive research has been done on local surface feature based methods as they are more robust to occlusion and clutter which are frequently present in a real-world scene. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing local surface feature based 3D object recognition methods. These methods generally comprise three phases: 3D keypoint detection. local surface feature description. and surface matching.

1276221,A new representation of skeleton sequences for 3d action recognition,2017,Qiuhong Ke and Mohammed Bennamoun and Senjian An and Ferdous Sohel and Farid Boussaid,,,,3288-3297,,This paper presents a new method for 3D action recognition with skeleton sequences (ie. 3D trajectories of human skeleton joints). The proposed method first transforms each skeleton sequence into three clips each consisting of several frames for spatial temporal feature learning using deep neural networks. Each clip is generated from one channel of the cylindrical coordinates of the skeleton sequence. Each frame of the generated clips represents the temporal information of the entire skeleton sequence. and incorporates one particular spatial relationship between the joints. The entire clips include multiple frames with different spatial relationships. which provide useful spatial structural information of the human skeleton. We propose to use deep convolutional neural networks to learn long-term temporal information of the skeleton sequence from the frames of the generated clips. and then use a Multi-Task Learning Network (MTLN) to jointly process all frames of the clips in parallel to incorporate spatial structural information for action recognition.

We present an algorithm for the detection of such keypoints on 3D models and partial views of objects. The keypoints are highly repeatable between partial views of an object and its complete 3D model. We also propose a quality measure to rank the keypoints and select the best ones for extracting local features. Keypoints are identified at locations where a unique local 3D coordinate basis can be derived from the underlying surface in order to extract invariant features.

They also have a vital role in tolerance to several physiological stressors in a variety of organisms including cyanobacteria. The mechanism of desiccation tolerance relies on phospholipid bilayers which are stabilized during water stress by sugars. especially by trehalose. Unsaturation of fatty acids also counteracts water or salt stress. Hydrogen atoms adjacent to olefinic bonds are susceptible to oxidative attack. Lipids are rich in these bonds and are a primary target for oxidative reactions. Lipid oxidation is problematic as enzymes do not control many oxidative chemical reactions and some of the products of the attack are highly reactive species that modify proteins and DNA.

In addition to the point mutations. trinucleotide repeat (CAG and GGN) length polymorphisms have been an additional subject of interest and controversy among geneticists. The polymorphic variations in triplet repeats have been associated with a number of disorders. but at the same time contradictory findings have also been reported. Further. studies on the same disorder in different populations have generated different results.

Thus. one of the important issues in wireless sensor network is the inherent limited battery power within the sensor nodes. Therefore. battery power is crucial parameter in the algorithm design in maximizing the lifespan of sensor nodes. It is also preferable to distribute the energy dissipated throughout the wireless sensor network in order to maximize overall network performance. Much research has been done in recent years in the area of low power routing protocol. but. there are still many design options open for improvement. and for further research targeted to the specific applications. need to be done.In this paper. we propose a new approach of an energy-efficient homogeneous clustering algorithm for wireless sensor networks in which the lifespan of the network is increased by ensuring a homogeneous distribution of nodes in the clusters. In this clustering algorithm. energy efficiency is distributed and network performance is improved by selecting cluster heads on the basis of (i) the residual energy of existing cluster heads.(ii) holdback value. and (iii) nearest hop distance of the node. In the proposed clustering algorithm. the cluster members are uniformly distributed and the life of the network is further extended.,True,7paDDwoAAAAJ:Es-9c2L5hKwC,186,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.172.6124&rep=rep1&type=pdf,13003157840001053054,/scholar?cites=13003157840001053054,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.172.6124&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Extending this algorithm to a feature space associated with the original input space via a certain nonlinear mapping function can provide a nonlinear version of the RX-algorithm. This nonlinear RX-algorithm. referred to as the kernel RX-algorithm. is basically intractable mainly due to the high dimensionality of the feature space produced by the nonlinear mapping function. However. in this paper it is shown that the kernel RX-algorithm can easily be implemented by kernelizing the RX-algorithm in the feature space in terms of kernels that implicitly compute dot products in the feature space.

This attenuation introduces bias to the resulting features and generates ill-conditioned feature matrices. The Gaussian Pyramid has been used as a feature enhancing technique that encodes scale-invariant characteristics into the feature space in an attempt to deal with this attenuation. However. at the core of the Gaussian Pyramid is a convolutional smoothing operation. which makes it incapable of generating new features at coarse scales. In order to address this problem. we propose a novel feature enhancing technique called Multi-skIp Feature Stacking (MIFS). which stacks features extracted using a family of differential filters parameterized with multiple time skips and encodes shift-invariance into the frequency space. MIFS compensates for information lost from using differential operators by recapturing information at coarse scales. This recaptured information allows us to match actions at different speeds and ranges of motion. We prove that MIFS enhances the learnability of differential-based features exponentially. The resulting feature matrices from MIFS have much smaller conditional numbers and variances than those from conventional methods. Experimental results show significantly improved performance on challenging action recognition and event detection tasks. Specifically. our method exceeds the state-of-the-arts on Hollywood2.

These approaches have been conspicuously effective in ameliorating the effects of transient maskers such as impulsive noise or background music. We described two broad classes of missing feature algorithms: feature-vector imputation algorithms (which restore unreliable components of incoming feature vectors) and classifier-modification algorithms (which dynamically reconfigure the classifier itself to cope with the effects of unreliable feature components). We reviewed the mathematics of four major missing feature techniques: the feature-imputation techniques of cluster-based reconstruction and covariance-based reconstruction. and the classifier-modification methods of class-conditional imputation and …,True,IWcGY98AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,275,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1511828/,656750044857576747,/scholar?cites=656750044857576747,,,,0,0,0

Microarray-based comparative genome hybridization (arrayCGH) or genotyping arrays have been standard technologies to detect large regions subject to copy number changes in genomes until most recently high-resolution sequence data can be analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). During the last several years. NGS-based analysis has been widely applied to identify CNVs in both healthy and diseased individuals. Correspondingly. the strong demand for NGS-based CNV analyses has fuelled development of numerous computational methods and tools for CNV detection.

1276280,Generalized core vector machines,2006,IW-H Tsang and JT-Y Kwok and Jacek M Zurada,17,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,5,1126-1140,IEEE,Kernel methods. such as the support vector machine (SVM). are often formulated as quadratic programming (QP) problems. However. given m training patterns. a naive implementation of the QP solver takes O(m  3 ) training time and at least O(m 2 ) space. Hence. scaling up these QPs is a major stumbling block in applying kernel methods on very large data sets. and a replacement of the naive method for finding the QP solutions is highly desirable.

The method employs a set of inequalities to render each memory pattern as a strict local minimum of a quadratic energy landscape. Based on the solution of this system. it gives a recurrent network of n multistate neurons with complex and symmetric synaptic weights. which operates on the finite state space {1.2.....K}/sup n/ to minimize this quadratic functional. Maximum number of integral vectors that can be embedded into the energy landscape of the network by this method is investigated by computer experiments.

1276282,Arcface: Additive angular margin loss for deep face recognition,2019,Jiankang Deng and Jia Guo and Niannan Xue and Stefanos Zafeiriou,,,,4690-4699,,One of the main challenges in feature learning using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for large-scale face recognition is the design of appropriate loss functions that can enhance the discriminative power. Centre loss penalises the distance between deep features and their corresponding class centres in the Euclidean space to achieve intra-class compactness. SphereFace assumes that the linear transformation matrix in the last fully connected layer can be used as a representation of the class centres in the angular space and therefore penalises the angles between deep features and their corresponding weights in a multiplicative way. Recently. a popular line of research is to incorporate margins in well-established loss functions in order to maximise face class separability. In this paper. we propose an Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) to obtain highly discriminative features for face recognition. The proposed ArcFace has a clear geometric interpretation due to its exact correspondence to geodesic distance on a hypersphere. We present arguably the most extensive experimental evaluation against all recent state-of-the-art face recognition methods on ten face recognition benchmarks which includes a new large-scale image database with trillions of pairs and a large-scale video dataset. We show that ArcFace consistently outperforms the state of the art and can be easily implemented with negligible computational overhead.

The motivation behind this approach is that. unlike the holistic texture based features used in the discriminative AAM approaches. the response map can be represented by a small set of parameters and these parameters can be very efficiently used for reconstructing unseen response maps. Furthermore. we show that by adopting very simple off-the-shelf regression techniques. it is possible to learn robust functions from response maps to the shape parameters updates. The experiments. conducted on Multi-PIE. XM2VTS and LFPW database. show that the proposed DRMF method outperforms stateof-the-art algorithms for the task of generic face fitting.

Even though very good performance for the facial landmark localization has been shown by many recently proposed discriminative techniques. when it comes to the applications that require excellent accuracy. such as facial behaviour analysis and facial motion capture. the semi-automatic person-specific or even tedious manual tracking is still the preferred choice. One way to construct a person-specific model automatically is through incremental updating of the generic model. This paper deals with the problem of updating a discriminative facial deformable model. a problem that has not been thoroughly studied in the literature. In particular. we study for the first time. to the best of our knowledge. the strategies to update a discriminative model that is trained by a cascade of regressors.

Manual annotation of each facial image in terms of landmarks requires a trained expert and the workload is usually enormous. Fatigue is one of the reasons that in some cases annotations are inaccurate. This is why. the majority of existing facial databases provide annotations for a relatively small subset of the training images. Furthermore. there is hardly any correspondence between the annotated landmarks across different databases. These problems make cross-database experiments almost infeasible. To overcome these difficulties. we propose a semi-automatic annotation methodology for annotating massive face datasets.

The idea is to extend the NMF algorithm in order to extract features that enforce not only the spatial locality. but also the separability between classes in a discriminant manner. The first method employs discriminant analysis in the features derived from NMF. In this way. a two-phase discriminant feature extraction procedure is implemented. namely NMF plus Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The second method incorporates the discriminant constraints inside the NMF decomposition. Thus. a decomposition of a face to its discriminant parts is obtained and new update rules for both the weights and the basis images are derived.

Given a sizeable training set. cascaded regression learns a set of generic rules that are sequentially applied to minimise the least squares problem. Despite the success of cascaded regression for problems such as face alignment and head pose estimation. there are several shortcomings arising in the strategies proposed thus far. Specifically.(a) the regressors are learnt independently.(b) the descent directions may cancel one another out and (c) handcrafted features (eg. HoGs. SIFT etc.) are mainly used to drive the cascade. which may be sub-optimal for the task at hand. In this paper. we propose a combined and jointly trained convolutional recurrent neural network architecture that allows the training of an end-to-end to system that attempts to alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks. The recurrent module facilitates the joint optimisation of the regressors by assuming the cascades form a nonlinear dynamical system. in effect fully utilising the information between all cascade levels by introducing a memory unit that shares information across all levels. The convolutional module allows the network to extract features that are specialised for the task at hand and are experimentally shown to outperform hand-crafted features.

Many imaging modalities exist. Some provide anatomical information and reveal information about the structure of the human body. and others provide functional information. locations of activity for specific activities and specified tasks. Each imaging system has a characteristic resolution. which is determined based on physical constraints of the system detectors that are in turn tuned to signal-to-noise and timing considerations. A common goal across systems is to increase the resolution. and as much as possible achieve true isotropic 3-D imaging. SR technology can serve to advance this goal. Research on SR in key medical imaging modalities. including MRI. fMRI and PET. has started to emerge in recent years and is reviewed herein.

Materials and Methods: Multiple international datasets. including from Chinese disease-infected areas were included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning models. modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19 thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient over time using a 3D volume review. generating a Corona score. The study includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and US). Results: Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT studies were 0.996 AUC (95% CI: 0.989-1.00); on datasets of Chinese control and infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity. 92.2% specificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients. the system output enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume. diameter) and visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume display.

We thus propose to oversample those images with small objects and augment each of those images by copy-pasting small objects many times.

They form an introduction to PhD studies in this topic and review of the literature concerning the best performing architectures. There is a large interest from both the research community and industry in using deep neural networks for tasks such as object recognition. segmentation. captioning. topic modelling. translation and speech recognition due to state-of-the-art results. It rarely happens that one generic algorithm is able to solve problems in so many different domains. Therefore. it is important to understand theoretical bases and available directions of research. In the following work. there is a review of the publication that appeared in the last 2 years with a comparison to well-established knowledge.Most of the thesis focuses on the literature overview. The experiments are designed to explore a model for image recognition that can be trained relatively quickly. The main limitation in neural machine vision is due to the overwhelming amount of time taken to train models. In this thesis. there are experiments with transfer learning. that use the same trained network architecture for different data domains. It achieves state-of-the-art results in Salient Object Subitizing problem exploiting better architectures requiring only less than one hour of training on mid-class GPU.

The algorithm is based on the more biologically plausible alternatives of the backpropagation (BP): direct feedback alignment (DFA) and feedback alignment (FA). which use random matrices to propagate error. The proposed method. memory-efficient direct feedback alignment (MEM-DFA). uses higher independence of layers in DFA and allows avoiding storing at once all activation vectors. unlike standard BP. FA. and DFA. Thus. our algorithm's memory usage is constant regardless of the number of layers in a neural network. The method increases the computational cost only by a constant factor of one extra forward pass.The MEM-DFA. BP. FA. and DFA were evaluated along with their memory profiles on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets on various neural network models.

As a criterion for this. the traditional method uses the Shannon entropy. originated from information theory. considering the gray level image histogram as a probability distribution. while we applied the Tsallis entropy as a general information theory entropy formalism. For the algorithm. we used the artificial bee colony approach since execution of an exhaustive algorithm would be too time-consuming. The experiments demonstrate that: 1) the Tsallis entropy is superior to traditional maximum entropy thresholding. maximum between class variance thresholding. and minimum cross entropy thresholding; 2) the artificial bee colony is more rapid than either genetic algorithm or particle swarm optimization.

To achieve this we first combine a state-of-the-art classifier (Residual-101 [14]) with a fast detection framework (SSD [18]). We then augment SSD+ Residual-101 with deconvolution layers to introduce additional large-scale context in object detection and improve accuracy. especially for small objects. calling our resulting system DSSD for deconvolutional single shot detector. While these two contributions are easily described at a high-level. a naive implementation does not succeed.

1276342,RetinaMask: Learning to predict masks improves state-of-the-art single-shot detection for free,2019,Cheng-Yang Fu and Mykhailo Shvets and Alexander C Berg,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.03353,,,,Recently two-stage detectors have surged ahead of single-shot detectors in the accuracy-vs-speed trade-off. Nevertheless single-shot detectors are immensely popular in embedded vision applications. This paper brings single-shot detectors up to the same level as current two-stage techniques. We do this by improving training for the state-of-the-art single-shot detector. RetinaNet. in three ways: integrating instance mask prediction for the first time. making the loss function adaptive and more stable. and including additional hard examples in training. We call the resulting augmented network RetinaMask. The detection component of RetinaMask has the same computational cost as the original RetinaNet. but is more accurate. COCO test-dev results are up to 41.4 mAP for RetinaMask-101 vs 39.1 mAP for RetinaNet-101. while the runtime is the same during evaluation. Adding Group Normalization increases the performance of RetinaMask-101 to 41.7 mAP.

An ideal MCISS should run accurately in a real-time fashion. In order to achieve accurate simulation results of MCISS. a lock-step approach. which synchronizes every cycle. is commonly used. However. this approach introduces immense overhead and lowers the simulation speed. Instead of synchronizing every cycle. our approach synchronizes the MCISS based on the data dependency among the simulated programs. Therefore. the synchronization overheads can be highly reduced while the accurate simulation results are ensured. With the proposed approach applied. the simulation speed of MCISS is up to 40~ 1.000 million instructions per second (MIPS) in general.,True,IYDJuOAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,24,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1629335.1629362,7783422870824470601,/scholar?cites=7783422870824470601,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ren-Song_Tsay/publication/220800756_An_effective_synchronization_approach_for_fast_and_accurate_multi-core_instruction-set_simulation/links/00b7d518ae7f24664d000000/An-effective-synchronization-approach-for-fast-and-accurate-multi-core-instruction-set-simulation.pdf,0,0,0

Ideally. we may run a MCISS in parallel to enhance the simulation speed. However. the conventional centralized timing synchronization mechanism would greatly constrain the parallelism of a MCISS. so the simulation speed is bounded.

1276348,Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild,2015,Ziwei Liu and Ping Luo and Xiaogang Wang and Xiaoou Tang,,,,,,Predicting face attributes in the wild is challenging due to complex face variations. We propose a novel deep learning framework for attribute prediction in the wild. It cascades two CNNs. LNet and ANet. which are fine-tuned jointly with attribute tags. but pre-trained differently. LNet is pre-trained by massive general object categories for face localization. while ANet is pre-trained by massive face identities for attribute prediction. This framework not only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin. but also reveals valuable facts on learning face representation.(1) It shows how the performances of face localization (LNet) and attribute prediction (ANet) can be improved by different pre-training strategies.(2) It reveals that although the filters of LNet are fine-tuned only with image-level attribute tags. their response maps over entire images have strong indication of face locations. This fact enables training LNet for face localization with only image-level annotations. but without face bounding boxes or landmarks. which are required by all attribute recognition works.(3) It also demonstrates that the high-level hidden neurons of ANet automatically discover semantic concepts after pre-training with massive face identities. and such concepts are significantly enriched after fine-tuning with attribute tags. Each attribute can be well explained with a sparse linear combination of these concepts.,True,aXdjxb4AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,3563,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/html/Liu_Deep_Learning_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.html,9137261784815578205,/scholar?cites=9137261784815578205,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/papers/Liu_Deep_Learning_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Cham,Facial landmark detection has long been impeded by the problems of occlusion and pose variation. Instead of treating the detection task as a single and independent problem. we investigate the possibility of improving detection robustness through multi-task learning. Specifically. we wish to optimize facial landmark detection together with heterogeneous but subtly correlated tasks. e.g. head pose estimation and facial attribute inference. This is non-trivial since different tasks have different learning difficulties and convergence rates. To address this problem. we formulate a novel tasks-constrained deep model. with task-wise early stopping to facilitate learning convergence. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed task-constrained learning (i) outperforms existing methods. especially in dealing with faces with severe occlusion and pose variation. and (ii) reduces model complexity drastically compared to …,True,aXdjxb4AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,1146,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10599-4_7,16482489996145376565,/scholar?cites=16482489996145376565,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-10599-4_7.pdf,0,0,0

Unlike previous works that optimized MRFs using iterative algorithm. we solve MRF by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). namely Deep Parsing Network (DPN). which enables deterministic end-to-end computation in a single forward pass. Specifically. DPN extends a contemporary CNN architecture to model unary terms and additional layers are carefully devised to approximate the mean field algorithm (MF) for pairwise terms. It has several appealing properties. First. different from the recent works that combined CNN and MRF. where many iterations of MF were required for each training image during back-propagation. DPN is able to achieve high performance by approximating one iteration of MF. Second. DPN represents various types of pairwise terms. making many existing works as its special cases. Third. DPN makes MF easier to be parallelized and speeded up in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU).

1276355,Deep Learning Strong Parts for Pedestrian Detection,2015,Yonglong Tian and Ping Luo and Xiaogang Wang and Xiaoou Tang,,,,,,Recent advances in pedestrian detection are attained by transferring the learned features of Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) to pedestrians. This ConvNet is typically pre-trained with massive general object categories (eg ImageNet). Although these features are able to handle variations such as poses. viewpoints. and lightings. they may fail when pedestrian images with complex occlusions are present. Occlusion handling is one of the most important problem in pedestrian detection. Unlike previous deep models that directly learned a single detector for pedestrian detection. we propose DeepParts. which consists of extensive part detectors. DeepParts has several appealing properties. First. DeepParts can be trained on weakly labeled data. ie only pedestrian bounding boxes without part annotations are provided. Second. DeepParts is able to handle low IoU positive proposals that shift away from ground truth. Third. each part detector in DeepParts is a strong detector that can detect pedestrian by observing only a part of a proposal.

1276356,Pedestrian detection aided by deep learning semantic tasks,2015,Yonglong Tian and Ping Luo and Xiaogang Wang and Xiaoou Tang,,,,,,Deep learning methods have achieved great success in pedestrian detection. owing to its ability to learn features from raw pixels. However. they can mainly capture middlelevel representations. such as pose of pedestrian. but confuses positive with hard negative samples (Fig. 1 (a)). which have large ambiguity and can only be distinguished by highlevel representation. To address this ambiguity. this work jointly optimize pedestrian detection with semantic tasks. including pedestrian attributes (eg'carrying backpack') and scene attributes (eg'vehicle'.'tree'. and'horizontal'). Rather than expensively annotating scene attributes. we transfer attributes information from existing scene segmentation datasets to the pedestrian dataset. by proposing a novel deep model to learn high-level features from multiple tasks and multiple data sources. Since distinct tasks have distinct convergence rates and data from different datasets have different distributions. a multi-task objective function is carefully designed to coordinate tasks and reduce discrepancies among datasets. The importance coefficients of tasks and network parameters in this objective function can be iteratively estimated.

1276372,Learning Spatially Regularized Correlation Filters for Visual Tracking,2015,Martin Danelljan and Gustav Häger and Fahad Shahbaz Khan and Michael Felsberg,,,,,,Robust and accurate visual tracking is one of the most challenging computer vision problems. Due to the inherent lack of training data. a robust approach for constructing a target appearance model is crucial. Recently. discriminatively learned correlation filters (DCF) have been successfully applied to address this problem for tracking. These methods utilize a periodic assumption of the training samples to efficiently learn a classifier on all patches in the target neighborhood. However. the periodic assumption also introduces unwanted boundary effects. which severely degrade the quality of the tracking model. We propose Spatially Regularized Discriminative Correlation Filters (SRDCF) for tracking. A spatial regularization component is introduced in the learning to penalize correlation filter coefficients depending on their spatial location. Our SRDCF formulation allows the correlation filters to be learned on a significantly larger set of negative training samples. without corrupting the positive samples. We further propose an optimization strategy. based on the iterative Gauss-Seidel method. for efficient online learning of our SRDCF. Experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets: OTB-2013. ALOV++. OTB-2015. and VOT2014. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all four datasets.

Most state-of-the-art visual trackers either rely on luminance information or use simple color representations for image description. Contrary to visual tracking. for object recognition and detection. sophisticated color features when combined with luminance have shown to provide excellent performance. Due to the complexity of the tracking problem. the desired color feature should be computationally efficient. and possess a certain amount of photometric invariance while maintaining high discriminative power. This paper investigates the contribution of color in a tracking-by-detection framework. Our results suggest that color attributes provides superior performance for visual tracking. We further propose an adaptive low-dimensional variant of color attributes. Both quantitative and attribute-based evaluations are performed on 41 challenging benchmark color sequences.

1276378,Color Attributes for Object Detection,2012,Fahad Shahbaz Khan and Rao Muhammad Anwer and Joost van de Weijer and Andrew D Bagdanov and Maria Vanrell and Antonio M Lopez,,,,,,State-of-the-art object detectors typically use shape information as a low level feature representation to capture the local structure of an object. This paper shows that early fusion of shape and color. as is popular in image classification. leads to a significant drop in performance for object detection. Moreover. such approaches also yields suboptimal results for object categories with varying importance of color and shape. In this paper we propose the use of color attributes as an explicit color representation for object detection. Color attributes are compact. computationally efficient. and when combined with traditional shape features provide state-of-the-art results for object detection. Our method is tested on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2009 datasets and results clearly show that our method improves over state-of-the-art techniques despite its simplicity. We also introduce a new dataset consisting of cartoon character …,True,zvaeYnUAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,336,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6248068/,12627351335056849771,/scholar?cites=12627351335056849771,,,http://cat.uab.cat/Public/Publications/2012/SRV2012/cvpr2012.pdf,0,0,0

1276380,Adaptive decontamination of the training set: A unified formulation for discriminative visual tracking,2016,Martin Danelljan and Gustav Hager and Fahad Shahbaz Khan and Michael Felsberg,,,,1430-1438,,Tracking-by-detection methods have demonstrated competitive performance in recent years. In these approaches. the tracking model heavily relies on the quality of the training set. Due to the limited amount of labeled training data. additional samples need to be extracted and labeled by the tracker itself. This often leads to the inclusion of corrupted training samples. due to occlusions. misalignments and other perturbations. Existing tracking-by-detection methods either ignore this problem. or employ a separate component for managing the training set. We propose a novel generic approach for alleviating the problem of corrupted training samples in tracking-by-detection frameworks. Our approach dynamically manages the training set by estimating the quality of the samples. Contrary to existing approaches. we propose a unified formulation by minimizing a single loss over both the target appearance model and the sample quality weights. The joint formulation enables corrupted samples to be down-weighted while increasing the impact of correct ones. Experiments are performed on three benchmarks: OTB-2015 with 100 videos. VOT-2015 with 60 videos. and Temple-Color with 128 videos. On the OTB-2015. our unified formulation significantly improves the baseline. with a gain of 3.8% in mean overlap precision.

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation. and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model.

1276401,Factored neural machine translation architectures,2016,Mercedes García-Martínez and Loïc Barrault and Fethi Bougares,,,,,,In this paper we investigate the potential of the neural machine translation (NMT) when taking into consideration the linguistic aspect of target language. From this standpoint. the NMT approach with attention mechanism [1] is extended in order to produce several linguistically derived outputs. We train our model to simultaneously output the lemma and its corresponding factors (eg part-of-speech. gender. number). The word level translation is built with a mapping function using a priori linguistic information. Compared to the standard NMT system. factored architecture increases significantly the vocabulary coverage while decreasing the number of unknown words. With its richer architecture. the Factored NMT approach allows us to implement several training setup that will be discussed in detail along this paper. On the IWSLT’15 English-to-French task. FNMT model outperforms NMT model in terms of BLEU score.

This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network. a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1] . The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically. the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then …,True,hE2mTp4AAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,8092,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7803544/,8599254436676320906,/scholar?cites=8599254436676320906,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/34/4359286/07803544.pdf,0,0,0
1276414,What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?,2017,Alex Kendall and Yarin Gal,,,,,,There are two major types of uncertainty one can model. Aleatoric uncertainty captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand. epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model--uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision. but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further. our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks. which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data. also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.,True,hE2mTp4AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,1664,https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04977,6063636260641358531,/scholar?cites=6063636260641358531,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04977,0,0,0

In this paper we make the observation that the performance of such systems is strongly dependent on the relative weighting between each task's loss. Tuning these weights by hand is a difficult and expensive process. making multi-task learning prohibitive in practice. We propose a principled approach to multi-task deep learning which weighs multiple loss functions by considering the homoscedastic uncertainty of each task. This allows us to simultaneously learn various quantities with different units or scales in both classification and regression settings. We demonstrate our model learning per-pixel depth regression. semantic and instance segmentation from a monocular input image.

Semantic segmentation is an important tool for visual scene understanding and a meaningful measure of uncertainty is essential for decision making. Our contribution is a practical system which is able to predict pixel-wise class labels with a measure of model uncertainty. We achieve this by Monte Carlo sampling with dropout at test time to generate a posterior distribution of pixel class labels. In addition. we show that modelling uncertainty improves segmentation performance by 2-3% across a number of state of the art architectures such as SegNet.

In particular. PoseNet is a deep convolutional neural network which learns to regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single image. It learns to localize using high level features and is robust to difficult lighting. motion blur and unknown camera intrinsics. where point based SIFT registration fails. However. it was trained using a naive loss function. with hyper-parameters which require expensive tuning. In this paper. we give the problem a more fundamental theoretical treatment.

Relying on recent developments in Bayesian deep learning. we use a continuous relaxation of dropout's discrete masks. Together with a principled optimisation objective. this allows for automatic tuning of the dropout probability in large models. and as a result faster experimentation cycles.

Inc.,Autonomous vehicle (AV) software is typically composed of a pipeline of individual components. linking sensor inputs to motor outputs. Erroneous component outputs propagate downstream. hence safe AV software must consider the ultimate effect of each component’s errors. Further. improving safety alone is not sufficient. Passengers must also feel safe to trust and use AV systems. To address such concerns. we investigate three under-explored themes for AV research: safety. interpretability. and compliance. Safety can be improved by quantifying the uncertainties of component outputs and propagating them forward through the pipeline. Interpretability is concerned with explaining what the AV observes and why it makes the decisions it does. building reassurance with the passenger. Compliance refers to maintaining some control for the passenger. We discuss open challenges for research within these themes.

Right at the birth of artificial intelligence. in his 1950 paper “Computing machinery and intelligence”. Alan Turing saw the ability to understand language as an essential test of intelligence. and an essential test of l-guage understanding was an ability to disambiguate; his example involved deciding between the generic and specific readings of the phrase a winter’s day. The first generations of AI researchers found it easy to construct-amples of ambiguities whose resolution seemed to require vast knowledge and deep understanding of the world and complex inference on this kno-edge; for example. Pharmacists dispense with accuracy. The disambig-tion problem was. in a way. nothing less than the artificial intelligence problem itself. No use was seen for a disambiguation method that was less than 100% perfect; either it worked or it didn’t.

However. their evaluation has focused on favorable conditions. using comparable corpora or closely-related languages. and we show that they often fail in more realistic scenarios. This work proposes an alternative approach based on a fully unsupervised initialization that explicitly exploits the structural similarity of the embeddings. and a robust self-learning algorithm that iteratively improves this solution.

The decoupled structure of FuN conveys several benefits–in addition to facilitating very long timescale credit assignment it also encourages the emergence of sub-policies associated with different goals set by the Manager. These properties allow FuN to dramatically outperform a strong baseline agent on tasks that involve long-term credit assignment or memorisation.,True,vDimc-4AAAAJ:ghEM2AJqZyQC,462,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/vezhnevets17a.html,2074247135017163310,/scholar?cites=2074247135017163310,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/vezhnevets17a/vezhnevets17a.pdf,0,0,0

However. these algorithms typically require a huge amount of data before they reach reasonable performance. In fact. their performance during learning can be extremely poor. This may be acceptable for a simulator. but it severely limits the applicability of deep RL to many real-world tasks. where the agent must learn in the real environment. In this paper we study a setting where the agent may access data from previous control of the system. We present an algorithm. Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations (DQfD). that leverages small sets of demonstration data to massively accelerate the learning process even from relatively small amounts of demonstration data and is able to automatically assess the necessary ratio of demonstration data while learning thanks to a prioritized replay mechanism. DQfD works by combining temporal difference updates with supervised classification of the demonstrator’s actions. We show that DQfD has better initial performance than Prioritized Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (PDD DQN) as it starts with better scores on the first million steps on 41 of 42 games and on average it takes PDD DQN 83 million steps to catch up to DQfD’s performance. DQfD learns to out-perform the best demonstration given in 14 of 42 games. In addition. DQfD leverages human demonstrations to achieve state-of-the-art results for 11 games. Finally. we show that DQfD performs better than three related algorithms for incorporating demonstration data into DQN.,True,vDimc-4AAAAJ:L_l9e5I586QC,451,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11757,6225249527608914570,/scholar?cites=6225249527608914570,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/11757/11616,0,0,0

The anti-cancer effect of fucoxanthin and its deacetylated metabolite. fucoxanthinol. is well documented. In view of its potent anti-carcinogenic activity. the need to understand the underlying mechanisms has gained prominence. Towards achieving this goal. several researchers have carried out studies in various cell lines and in vivo and have deciphered that fucoxanthin exerts its anti-proliferative and cancer preventing influence via different molecules and pathways including the Bcl-2 proteins. MAPK. NFκB. Caspases. GADD45. and several other molecules that are involved in either cell cycle arrest. apoptosis. or metastasis. Thus. in addition to decreasing the frequency of occurrence and growth of tumours. fucoxanthin has a cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. Some studies show that this effect is selective. ie.. fucoxanthin has the capability to target cancer cells only. leaving normal physiological cells unaffected/less affected. Hence. fucoxanthin and its metabolites show great promise as chemotherapeutic agents in cancer.

Advances in deep learning over the last few years have produced major speech recognition improvements on the representative Switchboard conversational corpus. Word error rates that just a few years ago were 14% have dropped to 8.0%. then 6.6% and most recently 5.8%. and are now believed to be within striking range of human performance. This then raises two issues-what IS human performance. and how far down can we still drive speech recognition error rates? A recent paper by Microsoft suggests that we have already achieved human performance. In trying to verify this statement. we performed an independent set of human performance measurements on two conversational tasks and found that human performance may be considerably better than what was earlier reported. giving the community a significantly harder goal to achieve. We also report on our own efforts in this area. presenting a set of acoustic and language modeling techniques that lowered the word error rate of our own English conversational telephone LVCSR system to the level of 5.5%/10.3% on the Switchboard/CallHome subsets of the Hub5 2000 evaluation. which-at least at the writing of this paper-is a new performance milestone (albeit not at what we measure to be human performance!).

They can also improve recognition despite the presence of domain shift or dataset bias: recent adversarial approaches to unsupervised domain adaptation reduce the difference between the training and test domain distributions and thus improve generalization performance. However. while generative adversarial networks (GANs) show compelling visualizations. they are not optimal on discriminative tasks and can be limited to smaller shifts. On the other hand. discriminative approaches can handle larger domain shifts. but impose tied weights on the model and do not exploit a GAN-based loss. In this work. we first outline a novel generalized framework for adversarial adaptation. which subsumes recent state-of-the-art approaches as special cases. and use this generalized view to better relate prior approaches. We then propose a previously unexplored instance of our general framework which combines discriminative modeling. untied weight sharing. and a GAN loss. which we call Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA).

Such models perform well in a supervised setting. but performance can be surprisingly poor under domain shifts that appear mild to a human observer.

Recently. deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as clear winners on object classification benchmarks. in part due to training with 1.2 M+ labeled classification images. Unfortunately. only a small fraction of those labels are available for the detection task. It is much cheaper and easier to collect large quantities of image-level labels from search engines than it is to collect detection data and label it with precise bounding boxes.

Part 1: Theory and algorithm,2002,GW Wei and YB Zhao and Yang Xiang,55,International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering,8,913-946,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,This paper presents a novel computational approach. the discrete singular convolution (DSC) algorithm. for analysing plate structures. The basic philosophy behind the DSC algorithm for the approximation of functions and their derivatives is studied. Approximations to the delta distribution are constructed as either bandlimited reproducing kernels or approximate reproducing kernels. Unified features of the DSC algorithm for solving differential equations are explored. It is demonstrated that different methods of implementation for the present algorithm. such as global. local. Galerkin. collocation. and finite difference. can be deduced from a single starting point. The use of the algorithm for the vibration analysis of plates with internal supports is discussed.

However. assessing methods for protein function prediction and tracking progress in the field remain challenging. We conducted the second critical assessment of functional annotation (CAFA). a timed challenge to assess computational methods that automatically assign protein function.

To review progress in the field. the analysis compared the best methods from CAFA1 to those of CAFA2. The top-performing methods in CAFA2 outperformed those from CAFA1. This increased accuracy can be attributed to a combination of the growing number of experimental annotations and improved methods for function prediction. The assessment also revealed that the definition of top-performing algorithms is ontology specific. that different performance metrics can be used to probe the nature of accurate predictions. and the relative diversity of predictions in the biological process and human phenotype ontologies.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models have achieved great success in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). Owing to the strength of deep networks. these CNN models learn an effective nonlinear mapping from the low-resolution input image to the high-resolution target image. at the cost of requiring enormous parameters. This paper proposes a very deep CNN model (up to 52 convolutional layers) named Deep Recursive Residual Network (DRRN) that strives for deep yet concise networks. Specifically. residual learning is adopted. both in global and local manners. to mitigate the difficulty of training very deep networks; recursive learning is used to control the model parameters while increasing the depth. Extensive benchmark evaluation shows that DRRN significantly outperforms state of the art in SISR. while utilizing far fewer parameters.

1276535,Memnet: A persistent memory network for image restoration,2017,Ying Tai and Jian Yang and Xiaoming Liu and Chunyan Xu,,,,4539-4547,,Recently. very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been attracting considerable attention in image restoration. However. as the depth grows. the long-term dependency problem is rarely realized for these very deep models. which results in the prior states/layers having little influence on the subsequent ones. Motivated by the fact that human thoughts have persistency. we propose a very deep persistent memory network (MemNet) that introduces a memory block. consisting of a recursive unit and a gate unit. to explicitly mine persistent memory through an adaptive learning process. The recursive unit learns multi-level representations of the current state under different receptive fields. The representations and the outputs from the previous memory blocks are concatenated and sent to the gate unit. which adaptively controls how much of the previous states should be reserved. and decides how much of the current state should be stored.

1276536,Face alignment across large poses: A 3d solution,2016,Xiangyu Zhu and Zhen Lei and Xiaoming Liu and Hailin Shi and Stan Z Li,,,,146-155,,Face alignment. which fits a face model to an image and extracts the semantic meanings of facial pixels. has been an important topic in CV community. However. most algorithms are designed for faces in small to medium poses (below 45 degree). lacking the ability to align faces in large-pose up to 90 degree. The challenges are three-fold: Firstly. the commonly used landmark-based face model assumes that all the landmarks are visible and is therefore not suitable for profile views. Secondly. the face appearance varies more dramatically in large poses. ranging from frontal view to profile view. Thirdly. labelling landmarks in large poses is an extremely challenging work since the invisible landmarks have to be guessed. In this paper. we propose a solution to the three problems in an new alignment framework. called 3D Dense Face Alignment (3DDFA). in which a dense 3D face model is fitted to the image via convolutional neutral network (CNN). We also propose a method to synthesize large-scale training samples in profile views to solve the third problem of data labelling.

Conventional approaches for pose-invariant face recognition either perform face frontalization on. or learn a pose-invariant representation from. a non-frontal face image. We argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly to allow them to leverage each other. To this end. this paper proposes Disentangled Representation learning-Generative Adversarial Network (DR-GAN) with three distinct novelties. First. the encoder-decoder structure of the generator allows DR-GAN to learn a generative and discriminative representation. in addition to image synthesis. Second. this representation is explicitly disentangled from other face variations such as pose. through the pose code provided to the decoder and pose estimation in the discriminator. Third. DR-GAN can take one or multiple images as the input. and generate one unified representation along with an arbitrary number of synthetic images.

Learning pose-invariant features is one solution. but needs expensively labeled large-scale data and carefully designed feature learning algorithms. In this work. we focus on frontalizing faces in the wild under various head poses. including extreme profile views. We propose a novel deep 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) conditioned Face Frontalization Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). termed as FF-GAN. to generate neutral head pose face images.

Previous deep learning approaches formulate face anti-spoofing as a binary classification problem. Many of them struggle to grasp adequate spoofing cues and generalize poorly. In this paper. we argue the importance of auxiliary supervision to guide the learning toward discriminative and generalizable cues. A CNN-RNN model is learned to estimate the face depth with pixel-wise supervision. and to estimate rPPG signals with sequence-wise supervision. The estimated depth and rPPG are fused to distinguish live vs. spoof faces.

Adversarial training injects such examples into training data to increase robustness. To scale this technique to large datasets. perturbations are crafted using fast single-step methods that maximize a linear approximation of the model's loss. We show that this form of adversarial training converges to a degenerate global minimum. wherein small curvature artifacts near the data points obfuscate a linear approximation of the loss. The model thus learns to generate weak perturbations. rather than defend against strong ones. As a result. we find that adversarial training remains vulnerable to black-box attacks. where we transfer perturbations computed on undefended models. as well as to a powerful novel single-step attack that escapes the non-smooth vicinity of the input data via a small random step. We further introduce Ensemble Adversarial Training. a technique that augments training data with perturbations transferred from other models. On ImageNet. Ensemble Adversarial Training yields models with strong robustness to black-box attacks.

Adversarial examples that affect one model often affect another model. even if the two models have different architectures or were trained on different training sets. so long as both models were trained to perform the same task. An attacker may therefore train their own substitute model. craft adversarial examples against the substitute. and transfer them to a victim model. with very little information about the victim. Recent work has further developed a technique that uses the victim model as an oracle to label a synthetic training set for the substitute. so the attacker need not even collect a training set to mount the attack. We extend these recent techniques using reservoir sampling to greatly enhance the efficiency of the training procedure for the substitute model.

Yet. these models are vulnerable to a class of malicious inputs known as adversarial examples. These are slightly perturbed inputs that are classified incorrectly by the ML model. The mitigation of these adversarial inputs remains an open problem. As a step towards understanding adversarial examples. we show that they are not drawn from the same distribution than the original data. and can thus be detected using statistical tests. Using thus knowledge. we introduce a complimentary approach to identify specific inputs that are adversarial. Specifically. we augment our ML model with an additional output. in which the model is trained to classify all adversarial inputs. We evaluate our approach on multiple adversarial example crafting methods (including the fast gradient sign and saliency map methods) with several datasets.

1276560,A tutorial on energy-based learning,2006,Yann LeCun and Sumit Chopra and Raia Hadsell and M Ranzato and F Huang,1,Predicting structured data,0,,,Energy-Based Models (EBMs) capture dependencies between variables by associating a scalar energy to each configuration of the variables. Inference consists in clamping the value of observed variables and finding configurations of the remaining variables that minimize the energy. Learning consists in finding an energy function in which observed configurations of the variables are given lower energies than unobserved ones. The EBM approach provides a common theoretical framework for many learning models. including traditional discriminative and generative approaches. as well as graph-transformer networks. conditional random fields. maximum margin Markov networks. and several manifold learning methods. Probabilistic models must be properly normalized. which sometimes requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all possible variable configurations. Since EBMs have no requirement for proper normalization. this problem is naturally circumvented. EBMs can be viewed as a form of non-probabilistic factor graphs. and they provide considerably more flexibility in the design of architectures and training criteria than probabilistic approaches.,True,Q0YEc-QAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,731,http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/orig/lecun-06.pdf,8819502341081664768,/scholar?cites=8819502341081664768,,,http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/orig/lecun-06.pdf,0,0,0

Developing an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for lung cancer is of great clinical importance and can increase the patient’s chance of survival. For this reason. CAD systems for lung cancer have been investigated in a huge number of research studies. A typical CAD system for lung cancer diagnosis is composed of four main processing steps: segmentation of the lung fields. detection of nodules inside the lung fields. segmentation of the detected nodules. and diagnosis of the nodules as benign or malignant. This paper overviews the current state-of-the-art techniques that have been developed to implement each of these CAD processing steps. For each technique. various aspects of technical issues. implemented methodologies. training and testing databases. and validation methods. as well as achieved performances. are described. In addition. the paper addresses several challenges that researchers face in each implementation step and outlines the strengths and drawbacks of the existing approaches for lung cancer CAD systems.,True,MdNb8Z0AAAAJ:D_tqNUsBuKoC,245,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijbi/2013/942353/abs/,5190738433249897783,/scholar?cites=5190738433249897783,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijbi/2013/942353/abs/,0,0,0

Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion. changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene. nonrigid object structures. object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions. and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically. assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application.

At the pixel level. statistical models of gradients and color are separately used to classify each pixel as belonging to background or foreground. In the region level. foreground pixels obtained from the color based subtraction are grouped into regions and gradient based subtraction is then used to make inferences about the validity of these regions.

Heidelberg,In this paper we discuss the issues that need to be resolved before fully automated outdoor surveillance systems can be developed. and present solutions to some of these problems. Any outdoor surveillance system must be able to track objects moving in its field of view. classify these objects and detect some of their activities. We have developed a method to track and classify these objects in realistic scenarios. Object tracking in a single camera is performed using background subtraction. followed by region correspondence. This takes into account multiple cues including velocities. sizes and distances of bounding boxes. Objects can be classified based on the type of their motion. This property may be used to label objects as a single person. vehicle or group of persons. Our proposed method to classify objects is based upon detecting recurrent motion for each tracked object.

In order to handle the change in observed colors of an object as it moves from one camera to another. we show that all brightness transfer functions from a given camera to another camera lie in a low dimensional subspace and demonstrate that this subspace can be used to compute appearance similarity.

Traditionally. these algorithms assume a stationary camera. and identify moving objects by detecting areas in a video that change over time. In this paper. we extend the concept of `subtracting' areas at rest to apply to video captured from a freely moving camera. We do not assume that the background is well-approximated by a plane or that the camera center remains stationary during motion. The method operates entirely using 2D image measurements without requiring an explicit 3D reconstruction of the scene. A sparse model of background is built by robustly estimating a compact trajectory basis from trajectories of salient features across the video. and the background is `subtracted' by removing trajectories that lie within the space spanned by the basis.

The extracted primary object regions are then used to build object models for optimized video segmentation. The proposed approach has several contributions: First. a novel layered Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based framework is presented for detection and segmentation of the primary object in video. We exploit the fact that. in general. objects are spatially cohesive and characterized by locally smooth motion trajectories. to extract the primary object from the set of all available proposals based on motion. appearance and predicted-shape similarity across frames. Second. the DAG is initialized with an enhanced object proposal set where motion based proposal predictions (from adjacent frames) are used to expand the set of object proposals for a particular frame. Last. the paper presents a motion scoring function for selection of object proposals that emphasizes high optical flow gradients at proposal boundaries to discriminate between moving objects and the background.

Firstly. the observations of an object are often widely separated in time and space when viewed from non-overlapping cameras. Secondly. the appearance of an object in one camera view might be very different from its appearance in another camera view due to the differences in illumination. pose and camera properties. To deal with the first problem. we observe that people or vehicles tend to follow the same paths in most cases. i.e.. roads. walkways. corridors etc. The proposed algorithm uses this conformity in the traversed paths to establish correspondence. The algorithm learns this conformity and hence the inter-camera relationships in the form of multivariate probability density of space–time variables (entry and exit locations. velocities. and transition times) using kernel density estimation.

Using only spatial information is not adequate; we need to take into consideration velocity and curvature information of a trajectory along with the spatial information for an elegant solution. Our method has the ability to distinguish between objects traversing spatially dissimilar paths. or objects traversing spatially proximal paths but having different spatio-temporal characteristics. The method consists of a path building training phase and a testing phase. During the training phase. we use graph-cuts for clustering the trajectories. where the Hausdorff distance metric is used to calculate the edge weights. Each cluster represents a path.

The videos depict acted-out emotions under realistic conditions with a large degree of variation in attributes such as pose and illumination. making it worthwhile to explore approaches which consider combinations of features from multiple modalities for label assignment. In this paper we present our approach to learning several specialist models using deep learning techniques. each focusing on one modality. Among these are a convolutional neural network. focusing on capturing visual information in detected faces. a deep belief net focusing on the representation of the audio stream. a K-Means based “bag-of-mouths” model. which extracts visual features around the mouth region and a relational autoencoder. which addresses spatio-temporal …,True,bn4xHHIAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,338,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12193-015-0195-2,5171780425389527285,/scholar?cites=5171780425389527285,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.01800,0,0,0

The level of performance of their visual system and its robustness to image degradations still surpasses the best computer vision systems despite decades of engineering effort. In particular. the high accuracy of primates in ultra rapid object categorization and rapid serial visual presentation tasks is remarkable. Given the number of processing stages involved and typical neural latencies. such rapid visual processing is likely to be mostly feedforward. Here we show that a specific implementation of a class of feedforward theories of object recognition (that extend the Hubel and Wiesel simple-to-complex cell hierarchy and account for many anatomical and physiological constraints) can predict the level and the pattern of performance achieved by humans on a rapid masked animal vs. non-animal categorization task.,True,kZlPW4wAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1009,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/15/6424.short,4082430801001463332,/scholar?cites=4082430801001463332,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/104/15/6424.full.pdf,0,0,0

The approach builds on recent work on object recognition based on hierarchical feedforward architectures [25. 16. 20] and extends a neurobiological model of motion processing in the visual cortex [10]. The system consists of a hierarchy of spatio-temporal feature detectors of increasing complexity: an input sequence is first analyzed by an array of motion- direction sensitive units which. through a hierarchy of processing stages. lead to position-invariant spatio-temporal feature detectors. We experiment with different types of motion-direction sensitive units as well as different system architectures. As in [16]. we find that sparse features in intermediate stages outperform dense ones and that using a simple feature selection approach leads to an efficient system that performs better with far fewer features.

These T antibodies selectively recognized putative NKCC proteins in a diverse variety of animal tissues. Western blot analysis of membranes isolated from 23 types of cells identified single bands of immunoreactive protein ranging in mass from 146 to 205 kDa. The amount of immunoreactive protein detected in these cells correlated with loop diuretic binding site density.

Since the mid-1980s. dietary fat intervention studies have been conducted to investigate the  effect of fat intake on endogenous estrogen levels. To further our understanding of the possible  relationship between dietary fat and breast cancer. we conducted a meta-analysis of dietary fat  intervention studies that investigated serum estradiol levels. and we reviewed the nature of the  evidence provided by prospective analytic studies of fat consumption and breast cancer risk.  METHODS: A computerized search of the English language literature on estrogen/estradiol and  dietary fat intervention studies published from January 1966 through June 1998 was conducted  using the MEDLINE® database. Pooled estimates were derived from the change in estradiol  levels associated with fat reduction from 13 studies.

To bridge the semantic gap between the predictive power of computational saliency models and human behavior. we propose a new saliency architecture that incorporates information at three layers: pixel-level image attributes. object-level attributes. and semantic-level attributes. Object-and semantic-level information is frequently ignored. or only a few sample object categories are discussed where scaling to a large number of object categories is not feasible nor neurally plausible. To address this problem. this work constructs a principled vocabulary of basic attributes to describe object-and semantic-level information thus not restricting to a limited number of object categories. We build a new dataset of 700 images with eye-tracking data of 15 viewers and annotation data of 5.551 segmented objects with fine contours and 12 semantic attributes (publicly available with the paper).

At traintime the quantized weights and activations are used for computing the parameter gradients. During the forward pass.

In addition. we construct target-specific saliency map by back-projecting CNN features with guidance of the SVM. and obtain the final tracking result in each frame based on the appearance model generatively constructed with the saliency map. Since the saliency map reveals spatial configuration of target effectively. it improves target localization accuracy and enables us to achieve pixel-level target segmentation. We verify the effectiveness of our tracking algorithm through extensive experiment on a challenging benchmark. where our method illustrates outstanding performance compared to the state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.,True,9aaeCToAAAAJ:TaaCk18tZOkC,740,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/hong15.html,8452657516733607725,/scholar?cites=8452657516733607725,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/hong15.pdf,0,0,0
1276659,Large scale image retrieval with attentive deep local features,2017,Hyeonwoo Noh and Andre Araujo and Jack Sim and Tobias Weyand and Bohyung Han,,,,3456-3465,,We propose an attentive local feature descriptor suitable for large-scale image retrieval. referred to as DELF (DEep Local Feature). The new feature is based on convolutional neural networks. which are trained only with image-level annotations on a landmark image dataset. To identify semantically useful local features for image retrieval. we also propose an attention mechanism for keypoint selection. which shares most network layers with the descriptor. This framework can be used for image retrieval as a drop-in replacement for other keypoint detectors and descriptors. enabling more accurate feature matching and geometric verification. Our system produces reliable confidence scores to reject false positives---in particular. it is robust against queries that have no correct match in the database. To evaluate the proposed descriptor. we introduce a new large-scale dataset. referred to as Google-Landmarks dataset. which involves challenges in both database and query such as background clutter. partial occlusion. multiple landmarks. objects in variable scales. etc.,True,9aaeCToAAAAJ:EaFouW7jFu4C,364,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Noh_Large-Scale_Image_Retrieval_ICCV_2017_paper.html,9521668325497245760,/scholar?cites=9521668325497245760,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Noh_Large-Scale_Image_Retrieval_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Contrary to existing approaches posing semantic segmentation as a single task of region-based classification. our algorithm decouples classification and segmentation. and learns a separate network for each task. In this architecture. labels associated with an image are identified by classification network. and binary segmentation is subsequently performed for each identified label in segmentation network. The decoupled architecture enables us to learn classification and segmentation networks separately based on the training data with image-level and pixel-wise class labels. respectively. It facilitates to reduce search space for segmentation effectively by exploiting class-specific activation maps obtained from bridging layers.

1276661,Image question answering using convolutional neural network with dynamic parameter prediction,2016,Hyeonwoo Noh and Paul Hongsuck Seo and Bohyung Han,,,,30-38,,We tackle image question answering (ImageQA) problem by learning a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a dynamic parameter layer whose weights are determined adaptively based on questions. For the adaptive parameter prediction. we employ a separate parameter prediction network. which consists of gated recurrent unit (GRU) taking a question as its input and a fully-connected layer generating a set of candidate weights as its output. However. it is challenging to construct a parameter prediction network for a large number of parameters in the fully-connected dynamic parameter layer of the CNN. We reduce the complexity of this problem by incorporating a hashing technique. where the candidate weights given by the parameter prediction network are selected using a predefined hash function to determine individual weights in the dynamic parameter layer. The proposed network---joint network with the CNN for ImageQA and the parameter prediction network---is trained end-to-end through back-propagation. where its weights are initialized using a pre-trained CNN and GRU.

The proposed algorithm employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to represent target appearances. where multiple CNNs collaborate to estimate target states and determine the desirable paths for online model updates in the tree. By maintaining multiple CNNs in diverse branches of tree structure. it is convenient to deal with multi-modality in target appearances and preserve model reliability through smooth updates along tree paths. Since multiple CNNs share all parameters in convolutional layers. it takes advantage of multiple models with little extra cost by saving memory space and avoiding redundant network evaluations. The final target state is estimated by sampling target candidates around the state in the previous frame and identifying the best sample in terms of a weighted average score from a set of active CNNs.

These problems are aggravated in real-time computer vision applications since density functions are required to be updated as new data becomes available.

1276664,Sequential kernel density approximation through mode propagation: applications to background modeling,2004,Bohyung Han and Dorin Comaniciu and Larry Davis,2004,Proc. ACCV,,,,Density-based modeling of visual features is very common in computer vision. either by using non-parametric techniques or through representing the underlying density function as a weighted sum of Gaussians. A number of real-time tasks such as background modeling or modeling the appearance of a moving target require sequential density estimation. where new data is incorporated in the model as it becomes available. Nevertheless. current methods for updating the density function either lack flexibility. by fixing the number of Gaussians in the mixture. or require large memory amounts. by maintaining a non-parametric representation of the density. This paper presents an efficient method for recursive density approximation that relies on the propagation of the density modes. At each time step. the modes of the density are re-estimated and a Gaussian component is assigned to each mode. The covariance of each component is derived from the Hessian matrix estimated at the mode location. To detect the modes we employ the variable-bandwidth mean shift. While the proposed density representation is memory efficient (which is typical for mixture densities). it inherits the flexibility of non-parametric methods. by allowing the number of modes to adapt in time. We show that the same mode propagation principle applies for subspaces derived from eigen analysis. Extensive experimental background modeling results demonstrate the performance of the method.,True,9aaeCToAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,211,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f46f/d3dc6dbaa84031a7c67ad728b0be4d0a9b35.pdf,9284748081288894575,/scholar?cites=9284748081288894575,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f46f/d3dc6dbaa84031a7c67ad728b0be4d0a9b35.pdf,0,0,0

We also employ a multi-task loss to jointly learn object association and bounding box regression for better localization. The whole network is trained end-to-end.

A significant correlation between interstitial fibrous tissue and EI was found (r = 0.87; p < 0.001). The separate influence of interstitial fat on muscle EI could not be established as only little fat was present. We conclude that fibrous tissue causes increased muscle EI.

Unlike most work on generative models. our primary goal is not to train a model that assigns high likelihood to test data. nor do we require the model to be able to learn well without using any labels. Using our new techniques. we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification on MNIST. CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data. and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3%. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes.,True,w68-7AYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,5017,https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498,2151481962498772342,/scholar?cites=2151481962498772342,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498,0,0,0
1276678,Improving language understanding by generative pre-training,2018,Alec Radford and Karthik Narasimhan and Tim Salimans and Ilya Sutskever,12,,,,,Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment. question answering. semantic similarity assessment. and document classification. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant. labeled data for learning these specific tasks is scarce. making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text. followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In contrast to previous approaches. we make use of task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task. significantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance. we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test). 5.7% on question answering (RACE). and 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).,True,w68-7AYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,2368,https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf,11028265058903086746,/scholar?cites=11028265058903086746,,,https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf,0,0,0
1276679,Weight normalization: A simple reparameterization to accelerate training of deep neural networks,2016,Tim Salimans and Diederik P Kingma,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.07868,,,,We present weight normalization: a reparameterization of the weight vectors in a neural network that decouples the length of those weight vectors from their direction. By reparameterizing the weights in this way we improve the conditioning of the optimization problem and we speed up convergence of stochastic gradient descent. Our reparameterization is inspired by batch normalization but does not introduce any dependencies between the examples in a minibatch. This means that our method can also be applied successfully to recurrent models such as LSTMs and to noise-sensitive applications such as deep reinforcement learning or generative models. for which batch normalization is less well suited. Although our method is much simpler. it still provides much of the speed-up of full batch normalization. In addition. the computational overhead of our method is lower. permitting more optimization steps to be taken in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on applications in supervised image recognition. generative modelling. and deep reinforcement learning.,True,w68-7AYAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1127,https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07868,5176697277672103356,/scholar?cites=5176697277672103356,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07868.pdf%7B,0,0,0

Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers. our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars. making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition. we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards. tolerant of extremely long horizons. and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.,True,w68-7AYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,828,https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03864,7940498538183461533,/scholar?cites=7940498538183461533,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03864.pdf%C3%A3%E2%80%9A%E2%80%99%C3%A5%20%E2%80%9A%C3%A7%E2%80%A6%C2%A7%C3%AF%C2%BC%E2%80%B0,0,0,0

This local reparameterization translates uncertainty about global parameters into local noise that is independent across datapoints in the minibatch. Such parameterizations can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is inversely proportional to the minibatch size. generally leading to much faster convergence. Additionally. we explore a connection with dropout: Gaussian dropout objectives correspond to SGVB with local reparameterization. a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance. Our method allows inference of more flexibly parameterized posteriors; specifically. we propose variational dropout. a generalization of Gaussian dropout where the dropout rates are learned. often leading to better models.

Numerous isolates from diverse areas of the world's oceans have been studied and shown to be physiologically and genetically distinct. All isolates described thus far can be assigned to either a tightly clustered high-light (HL)-adapted clade. or a more divergent low-light (LL)-adapted group. The 16S rRNA sequences of the entire Prochlorococcus group differ by at most 3%. and the four initially published genomes revealed patterns of genetic differentiation that help explain physiological differences among the isolates. Here we describe the genomes of eight newly sequenced isolates and combine them with the first four genomes for a comprehensive analysis of the core (shared by all isolates) and flexible genes of the Prochlorococcus group. and the patterns of loss and gain of the flexible genes over the course of evolution. There are 1.273 genes that represent the core shared by all 12 genomes. They are apparently sufficient. according to metabolic reconstruction. to encode a functional cell. We describe a phylogeny for all 12 isolates by subjecting their complete proteomes to three different phylogenetic analyses. For each non-core gene. we used a maximum parsimony method to estimate which ancestor likely first acquired or lost each gene.

Despite its importance. the ability to study metabolism at a global scale using genomic technologies is limited. In principle. complete genome sequences describe the range of metabolic reactions that are possible for an organism. but cannot quantitatively describe the behaviour of these reactions. We present a novel method for modeling metabolic states using whole cell measurements of gene expression. Our method. which we call E-Flux (as a combination of flux and expression). extends the technique of Flux Balance Analysis by modeling maximum flux constraints as a function of measured gene expression. In contrast to previous methods for metabolically interpreting gene expression data. E-Flux utilizes a model of the underlying metabolic network to directly predict changes in metabolic flux capacity. We applied E-Flux to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). Key components of mycobacterial cell walls are mycolic acids which are targets for several first-line TB drugs. We used E-Flux to predict the impact of 75 different drugs. drug combinations. and nutrient conditions on mycolic acid biosynthesis capacity in M. tuberculosis. using a public compendium of over 400 expression arrays.

Infection by Paracoccidioides. a dimorphic fungus in the order Onygenales. is coupled with a thermally regulated transition from a soil-dwelling filamentous form to a yeast-like pathogenic form. To better understand the genetic basis of growth and pathogenicity in Paracoccidioides. we sequenced the genomes of two strains of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb03 and Pb18) and one strain of Paracoccidioides lutzii (Pb01). These genomes range in size from 29.1 Mb to 32.9 Mb and encode 7.610 to 8.130 genes. To enable genetic studies. we mapped 94% of the P. brasiliensis Pb18 assembly onto five chromosomes. We characterized gene family content across Onygenales and related fungi. and within Paracoccidioides we found expansions of the fungal-specific kinase family FunK1.

However. there has been little work exploring useful architectures for attention-based NMT. This paper examines two simple and effective classes of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always attends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches over the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention. we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures has established a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT'15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points. an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker.,True,Bmbkv6sAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,5559,https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025,12347446836257434866,/scholar?cites=12347446836257434866,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04025),0,0,0
1276722,Better word representations with recursive neural networks for morphology,2013,Minh-Thang Luong and Richard Socher and Christopher D Manning,,,,104-113,,Vector-space word representations have been very successful in recent years at improving performance across a variety of NLP tasks. However. common to most existing work. words are regarded as independent entities without any explicit relationship among morphologically related words being modeled. As a result. rare and complex words are often poorly estimated. and all unknown words are represented in a rather crude way using only one or a few vectors. This paper addresses this shortcoming by proposing a novel model that is capable of building representations for morphologically complex words from their morphemes. We combine recursive neural networks (RNNs). where each morpheme is a basic unit. with neural language models (NLMs) to consider contextual information in learning morphologicallyaware word representations. Our learned models outperform existing word representations by a good margin on word similarity tasks across many datasets. including a new dataset we introduce focused on rare words to complement existing ones in an interesting way.,True,Bmbkv6sAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,846,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-3512.pdf,1597118553999846859,/scholar?cites=1597118553999846859,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-3512.pdf,0,0,0

A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to correctly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively small vocabularies with a single unk symbol that represents every possible out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. In this paper. we propose and implement an effective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on data that is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm. allowing the NMT system to emit. for each OOV word in the target sentence. the position of its corresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary. Our experiments on the WMT14 English to French translation task show that this method provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique.

To date. most of its applications focused on only one task and not much work explored this framework for multiple tasks. This paper examines three multi-task learning (MTL) settings for sequence to sequence models:(a) the oneto-many setting-where the encoder is shared between several tasks such as machine translation and syntactic parsing.(b) the many-to-one setting-useful when only the decoder can be shared. as in the case of translation and image caption generation. and (c) the many-to-many setting-where multiple encoders and decoders are shared. which is the case with unsupervised objectives and translation. Our results show that training on a small amount of parsing and image caption data can improve the translation quality between English and German by up to 1.5 BLEU points over strong single-task baselines on the WMT benchmarks. Furthermore. we have established a new state-of-the-art result in constituent parsing with 93.0 F1.

Despite their success. these models are often slow for both training and inference due to the sequential nature of RNNs. We propose a new Q\&A architecture called QANet. which does not require recurrent networks: Its encoder consists exclusively of convolution and self-attention. where convolution models local interactions and self-attention models global interactions. On the SQuAD dataset. our model is 3x to 13x faster in training and 4x to 9x faster in inference. while achieving equivalent accuracy to recurrent models. The speed-up gain allows us to train the model with much more data. We hence combine our model with data generated by backtranslation from a neural machine translation model.

Common among recent approaches is the use of consistency training on a large amount of unlabeled data to constrain model predictions to be invariant to input noise. In this work. we present a new perspective on how to effectively noise unlabeled examples and argue that the quality of noising. specifically those produced by advanced data augmentation methods. plays a crucial role in semi-supervised learning. By substituting simple noising operations with advanced data augmentation methods. our method brings substantial improvements across six language and three vision tasks under the same consistency training framework.

1276729,Massive exploration of neural machine translation architectures,2017,Denny Britz and Anna Goldie and Minh-Thang Luong and Quoc Le,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.03906,,,,Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has shown remarkable progress over the past few years with production systems now being deployed to end-users. One major drawback of current architectures is that they are expensive to train. typically requiring days to weeks of GPU time to converge. This makes exhaustive hyperparameter search. as is commonly done with other neural network architectures. prohibitively expensive. In this work. we present the first large-scale analysis of NMT architecture hyperparameters. We report empirical results and variance numbers for several hundred experimental runs. corresponding to over 250.000 GPU hours on the standard WMT English to German translation task. Our experiments lead to novel insights and practical advice for building and extending NMT architectures. As part of this contribution. we release an open-source NMT framework that enables researchers to easily experiment with novel techniques and reproduce state of the art results.,True,Bmbkv6sAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,405,https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03906,17797498583666145091,/scholar?cites=17797498583666145091,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03906,0,0,0
1276730,Electra: Pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than generators,2020,Kevin Clark and Minh-Thang Luong and Quoc V Le and Christopher D Manning,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.10555,,,,Masked language modeling (MLM) pre-training methods such as BERT corrupt the input by replacing some tokens with [MASK] and then train a model to reconstruct the original tokens. While they produce good results when transferred to downstream NLP tasks. they generally require large amounts of compute to be effective. As an alternative. we propose a more sample-efficient pre-training task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input. our approach corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then. instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens. we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result. the contextual representations learned by our approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size. data. and compute. The gains are particularly strong for small models; for example. we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale. where it performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when using the same amount of compute.,True,Bmbkv6sAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,380,https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10555,18273102803868155691,/scholar?cites=18273102803868155691,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10555.pdf%3C/p%3E,0,0,0
1276731,Achieving open vocabulary neural machine translation with hybrid word-character models,2016,Minh-Thang Luong and Christopher D Manning,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.00788,,,,Nearly all previous work on neural machine translation (NMT) has used quite restricted vocabularies. perhaps with a subsequent method to patch in unknown words. This paper presents a novel word-character solution to achieving open vocabulary NMT. We build hybrid systems that translate mostly at the word level and consult the character components for rare words. Our character-level recurrent neural networks compute source word representations and recover unknown target words when needed. The twofold advantage of such a hybrid approach is that it is much faster and easier to train than character-based ones; at the same time. it never produces unknown words as in the case of word-based models. On the WMT'15 English to Czech translation task. this hybrid approach offers an addition boost of+ 2.1-11.4 BLEU points over models that already handle unknown words. Our best system achieves a new state-of-the-art result with 20.7 BLEU score. We demonstrate that our character models can successfully learn to not only generate well-formed words for Czech. a highly-inflected language with a very complex vocabulary. but also build correct representations for English source words.,True,Bmbkv6sAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,368,https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00788,7652846715026310814,/scholar?cites=7652846715026310814,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00788,0,0,0

The covariance of d-features. e.g.. the three-dimensional color vector. the norm of first and second derivatives of intensity with respect to x and y. etc.. characterizes a region of interest. We describe a fast method for computation of covariances based on integral images. The idea presented here is more general than the image sums or histograms. which were already published before. and with a series of integral images the covariances are obtained by a few arithmetic operations.

However. learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions. To reduce this gap. we propose Simulated+ Unsupervised (S+ U) learning. where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a simulator's output using unlabeled real data. while preserving the annotation information from the simulator. We develop a method for S+ U learning that uses an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). but with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations. avoid artifacts. and stabilize training:(i) a'self-regularization'term.(ii) a local adversarial loss. and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images. which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation and hand pose estimation.

In contrast to the existing approaches. which require tuples of corresponding images in different domains in the training set. CoGAN can learn a joint distribution without any tuple of corresponding images. It can learn a joint distribution with just samples drawn from the marginal distributions. This is achieved by enforcing a weight-sharing constraint that limits the network capacity and favors a joint distribution solution over a product of marginal distributions one. We apply CoGAN to several joint distribution learning tasks. including learning a joint distribution of color and depth images. and learning a joint distribution of face images with different attributes. For each task it successfully learns the joint distribution without any tuple of corresponding images. We also demonstrate its applications to domain adaptation and image transformation.,True,Fe7NTe0AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,1144,https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07536,9131569704953326400,/scholar?cites=9131569704953326400,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07536,0,0,0
1276735,Voxelnet: End-to-end learning for point cloud based 3d object detection,2018,Yin Zhou and Oncel Tuzel,,IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),,,,Accurate detection of objects in 3D point clouds is a central problem in many applications. such as autonomous navigation. housekeeping robots. and augmented/virtual reality. To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN). most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations. for example. a bird's eye view projection. In this work. we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet. a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage. end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically. VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way. the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation. which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore. our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries. leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists. based on only LiDAR.,True,Fe7NTe0AAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC,1106,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Zhou_VoxelNet_End-to-End_Learning_CVPR_2018_paper.html,8219640496202186405,/scholar?cites=8219640496202186405,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Zhou_VoxelNet_End-to-End_Learning_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf,0,0,0

The entropy rate favors formation of compact and homogeneous clusters. while the balancing function encourages clusters with similar sizes. We present a novel graph construction for images and show that this construction induces a matroid - a combinatorial structure that generalizes the concept of linear independence in vector spaces. The segmentation is then given by the graph topology that maximizes the objective function under the matroid constraint.

Recently. two-stream convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on stacked optical flow and image frames have been successful for action recognition in videos. Our system uses a tracking algorithm to locate a bounding box around the person. which provides a frame of reference for appearance and motion and also suppresses background noise that is not within the bounding box. We train two additional streams on motion and appearance cropped to the tracked bounding box. along with full-frame streams. Our motion streams use pixel trajectories of a frame as raw features. in which the displacement values corresponding to a moving scene point are at the same spatial position across several frames. To model long-term temporal dynamics within and between actions. the multi-stream CNN is followed by a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer. We show that our bi-directional LSTM network utilizes about 8 seconds of the video sequence to predict an action label.

Most state-of-the-art visual trackers either rely on luminance information or use simple color representations for image description. Contrary to visual tracking. for object recognition and detection. sophisticated color features when combined with luminance have shown to provide excellent performance. Due to the complexity of the tracking problem. the desired color feature should be computationally efficient. and possess a certain amount of photometric invariance while maintaining high discriminative power.

1276749,Boosting color saliency in image feature detection,2006,Joost Van De Weijer and Theo Gevers and Andrew D Bagdanov,28,"Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on",1,150-156,IEEE,The aim of salient feature detection is to find distinctive local events in images. Salient features are generally determined from the local differential structure of images. They focus on the shape-saliency of the local neighborhood. The majority of these detectors are luminance-based. which has the disadvantage that the distinctiveness of the local color information is completely ignored in determining salient image features. To fully exploit the possibilities of salient point detection in color images. color distinctiveness should be taken into account in addition to shape distinctiveness. In this paper. color distinctiveness is explicitly incorporated into the design of saliency detection. The algorithm. called color saliency boosting. is based on an analysis of the statistics of color image derivatives. Color saliency boosting is designed as a generic method easily adaptable to existing feature detectors. Results show that substantial …,True,Gsw2iUEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,395,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1542040/,3885384024853989658,/scholar?cites=3885384024853989658,,,https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00548615/document,0,0,0
1276750,Fast anisotropic gauss filtering,2003,J-M Geusebroek and Arnold WM Smeulders and Joost Van De Weijer,12,IEEE transactions on image processing,8,938-943,IEEE,We derive the decomposition of the anisotropic Gaussian in a one-dimensional (1-D) Gauss filter in the x-direction followed by a 1-D filter in a nonorthogonal direction /spl phi/. So also the anisotropic Gaussian can be decomposed by dimension. This appears to be extremely efficient from a computing perspective. An implementation scheme for normal convolution and for recursive filtering is proposed. Also directed derivative filters are demonstrated. For the recursive implementation. filtering an 512 /spl times/ 512 image is performed within 40 msec on a current state of the art PC. gaining over 3 times in performance for a typical filter. independent of the standard deviations and orientation of the filter. Accuracy of the filters is still reasonable when compared to truncation error or recursive approximation error.

This paper shows that early fusion of shape and color. as is popular in image classification. leads to a significant drop in performance for object detection. Moreover. such approaches also yields suboptimal results for object categories with varying importance of color and shape. In this paper we propose the use of color attributes as an explicit color representation for object detection. Color attributes are compact. computationally efficient. and when combined with traditional shape features provide state-of-the-art results for object detection.

However. so far. gamut mapping algorithms are restricted to the use of pixel values to estimate the illuminant.Therefore. in this paper. gamut mapping is extended to incorporate the statistical nature of images. It is analytically shown that the proposed gamut mapping framework is able to include any linear filter output. The main focus is on the local n-jet describing the derivative structure of an image. It is shown that derivatives have the advantage over pixel values to be invariant to disturbing effects (i.e. deviations of the diagonal model) such as saturated colors and diffuse light. Further. as the n-jet based gamut mapping has the ability to use more information than pixel values alone. the combination of these algorithms are more stable than the regular gamut mapping algorithm.

For example. in disease diagnosis. even though humans have a large number of genes. only a small number of them contribute to certain disease [16. 17]. In neuroscience. the neural representation of sounds in the auditory cortex of unanesthetized animals is sparse. since the fraction of neurons that are active at a given instant is typically small [20]. In signal processing. many natural signals are sparse in that they have concise representations when expressed under a proper basis [7]. Therefore. finding sparse representations is fundamentally important in many fields of science. The last decade has witnessed a growing interest in the search for sparse representations of data. l1-Norm Regularization Most existing work on sparse learning are based on a variant of the l1 norm regularization due to its sparsity-inducing property. convenient convexity. strong theoretical guarantees. and great empirical success in various applications. The use of the l1 norm regularization has led to sparse models for linear regression [69]. principle component analysis [83]. linear discriminant analysis [76]. canonical correlation analysis [65. 75]. partial least squares [28]. support vector machines [82]. and logistic regression [27. 35. 64. 68]. l1/lq-Norm Regularization Recent studies in areas such as machine learning and statistics have also witnessed growing interests in extending the l1-regularization to the l1/lq-regularization [2. 3. 6. 11. 31. 32. 33. 34. 36. 44. 48. 55. 56. 59. 80. 81].

1276767,Multi-task feature learning via efficient l2. 1-norm minimization,2012,Jun Liu and Shuiwang Ji and Jieping Ye,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1205.2631,,,,The problem of joint feature selection across a group of related tasks has applications in many areas including biomedical informatics and computer vision. We consider the l2. 1-norm regularized regression model for joint feature selection from multiple tasks. which can be derived in the probabilistic framework by assuming a suitable prior from the exponential family. One appealing feature of the l2. 1-norm regularization is that it encourages multiple predictors to share similar sparsity patterns. However. the resulting optimization problem is challenging to solve due to the non-smoothness of the l2. 1-norm regularization. In this paper. we propose to accelerate the computation by reformulating it as two equivalent smooth convex optimization problems which are then solved via the Nesterov's method-an optimal first-order black-box method for smooth convex optimization.

In the isointense stage (approximately 6–8 months of age). WM and GM exhibit similar levels of intensity in both T1 and T2 MR images. making the tissue segmentation very challenging. Only a small number of existing methods have been designed for tissue segmentation in this isointense stage; however. they only used a single T1 or T2 images. or the combination of T1 and T2 images. In this paper. we propose to use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmenting isointense stage brain tissues using multi-modality MR images. CNNs are a type of deep models in which trainable filters and local neighborhood pooling operations are applied alternatingly on the raw input images. resulting in a hierarchy …,True,BZGj6sAAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,626,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914010660,12953292536962482516,/scholar?cites=12953292536962482516,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4323729/,0,0,0
1276769,An accelerated gradient method for trace norm minimization,2009,Shuiwang Ji and Jieping Ye,,,,457-464,,We consider the minimization of a smooth loss function regularized by the trace norm of the matrix variable. Such formulation finds applications in many machine learning tasks including multi-task learning. matrix classification. and matrix completion. The standard semidefinite programming formulation for this problem is computationally expensive. In addition. due to the non-smooth nature of the trace norm. the optimal first-order black-box method for solving such class of problems converges as O (1/√ k). where k is the iteration counter. In this paper. we exploit the special structure of the trace norm. based on which we propose an extended gradient algorithm that converges as O (1/k).

Cham,Combining multi-modality brain data for disease diagnosis commonly leads to improved performance. A challenge in using multi-modality data is that the data are commonly incomplete; namely. some modality might be missing for some subjects. In this work. we proposed a deep learning based framework for estimating multi-modality imaging data. Our method takes the form of convolutional neural networks. where the input and output are two volumetric modalities. The network contains a large number of trainable parameters that capture the relationship between input and output modalities. When trained on subjects with all modalities. the network can estimate the output modality given the input modality. We evaluated our method on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. where the input and output modalities are MRI and PET images. respectively.

It projects both sets of variables onto a lower-dimensional space in which they are maximally correlated. CCA is commonly applied for supervised dimensionality reduction in which the two sets of variables are derived from the data and the class labels. respectively. It is well-known that CCA can be formulated as a least-squares problem in the binary class case. However. the extension to the more general setting remains unclear. In this paper. we show that under a mild condition which tends to hold for high-dimensional data. CCA in the multilabel case can be formulated as a least-squares problem.

However. most of the sparse subspace learning methods are unsupervised and unsuitable for classification tasks. In this paper. a new sparse subspace learning algorithm called discriminant sparse neighborhood preserving embedding (DSNPE) is proposed by adding the discriminant information into sparse neighborhood preserving embedding (SNPE). DSNPE not only preserves the sparse reconstructive relationship of SNPE. but also sufficiently utilizes the global discriminant structures from the following two aspects: (1) maximum margin criterion (MMC) is added into the objective function of DSNPE; (2) only the training samples with the same label as the current sample are used to compute the sparse reconstructive relationship.

1276773,Graph U-Nets,2019,Hongyang Gao and Shuiwang Ji,,,,2083-2092,,We consider the problem of representation learning for graph data. Convolutional neural networks can naturally operate on images. but have significant challenges in dealing with graph data. Given images are special cases of graphs with nodes lie on 2D lattices. graph embedding tasks have a natural correspondence with image pixel-wise prediction tasks such as segmentation. While encoder-decoder architectures like U-Nets have been successfully applied on many image pixel-wise prediction tasks. similar methods are lacking for graph data. This is due to the fact that pooling and up-sampling operations are not natural on graph data. To address these challenges. we propose novel graph pooling (gPool) and unpooling (gUnpool) operations in this work. The gPool layer adaptively selects some nodes to form a smaller graph based on their scalar projection values on a trainable projection vector. We further propose the gUnpool layer as the inverse operation of the gPool layer. The gUnpool layer restores the graph into its original structure using the position information of nodes selected in the corresponding gPool layer. Based on our proposed gPool and gUnpool layers. we develop an encoder-decoder model on graph. known as the graph U-Nets. Our experimental results on node classification and graph classification tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve consistently better performance than previous models.,True,BZGj6sAAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC,244,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/gao19a.html,2250116536319373587,/scholar?cites=2250116536319373587,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/gao19a/gao19a.pdf,0,0,0

One natural way to deal with such problems is to construct a binary classifier for each label. resulting in a set of independent binary classification problems. Since the multiple labels share the same input space. and the semantics conveyed by different labels are usually correlated. it is essential to exploit the correlation information contained in different labels. In this paper. we consider a general framework for extracting shared structures in multi-label classification. In this framework. a common subspace is assumed to be shared among multiple labels.

1276794,An introduction to Markov state models and their application to long timescale molecular simulation,2013,Gregory R Bowman and Vijay S Pande and Frank Noé,797,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,The aim of this book volume is to explain the importance of Markov state models to molecular simulation. how they work. and how they can be applied to a range of problems. The Markov state model (MSM) approach aims to address two key challenges of molecular simulation: 1) How to reach long timescales using short simulations of detailed molecular models. 2) How to systematically gain insight from the resulting sea of data. MSMs do this by providing a compact representation of the vast conformational space available to biomolecules by decomposing it into states sets of rapidly interconverting conformations and the rates of transitioning between states. This kinetic definition allows one to easily vary the temporal and spatial resolution of an MSM from high-resolution models capable of quantitative agreement with (or prediction of) experiment to low-resolution models that facilitate understanding. Additionally. MSMs facilitate the calculation of quantities that are difficult to obtain from more direct MD analyses. such as the ensemble of transition pathways. This book introduces the mathematical foundations of Markov models. how they can be used to analyze simulations and drive efficient simulations. and some of the insights these models have yielded in a variety of applications of molecular simulation.,True,QGiLc_cAAAAJ:0aNKY9CYzMkC,396,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ggnGBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP3&dq=info:8sf4EnG5Y_oJ:scholar.google.com&ots=I7-6hDg32H&sig=iRJG6OXvSWqRFCgY1R0Hmst26d0,18042468427477075954,/scholar?cites=18042468427477075954,,,,0,0,0

Prior to presentation. peptides need to be generated from proteins that are either produced by the cell’s own translational machinery or that are funneled into the endo-lysosomal vesicular system. The prolonged interaction between a T cell receptor (TCR) and specific pMHC complexes. after an extensive search process in secondary lymphatic organs. eventually triggers T cells to proliferate and to mount a specific cellular immune response. Once processed. the peptide repertoire presented by MHC proteins largely depends on structural features of the binding groove of each particular MHC allelic variant. Additionally. two peptide editors - tapasin for class I and HLA-DM for class II - contribute to the shaping of the presented peptidome by favoring the binding of high affinity antigens. Although there is a vast amount of biochemical and structural information. the mechanism of the catalyzed peptide exchange for MHC class I and class II proteins still remains controversial and it is not well understood why certain MHC allelic variants are more susceptible to peptide editing than others. Recent studies predict a high impact of protein intermediate states on MHC allele-specific peptide presentation. which implies a profound influence of MHC dynamics on the concept of immunodominance and the development of autoimmune diseases. Here. we review the recent literature that describe MHC class I and II dynamics from a theoretical and experimental point of view and we highlight the similarities between MHC class I and class II dynamics despite the …,True,QGiLc_cAAAAJ:PFhWnMnuT1QC,318,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00292/full,15141845607674189383,/scholar?cites=15141845607674189383,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00292/full,0,0,0

The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting. communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal.A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation. the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network---as many as the number of users of a given service. each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular. we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices.

We develop algorithms that minimize the trajectory modifications under two different assumptions:(a) the movements of all the nodes in the system are known and (b) the movements of the hosts in the system are not known.,True,hHKC6FEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,419,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/345910.345918,13397747613663572202,/scholar?cites=13397747613663572202,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniela_Rus/publication/2436330_Sending_Messages_to_Mobile_Users_in_Disconnected_Ad-hoc_Wireless_Networks/links/56d0438508ae059e375cfad8.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we use a histogram-based method for outlier detection to reduce communication cost. Rather than collecting all the data in one location for centralized processing. we propose collecting hints (in the form of a histogram) about the data distribution. and using the hints to filter out unnecessary data and identify potential outliers. We show that this method can be used for detecting outliers in terms of two different definitions.

However. existing approaches have limited scalability and robustness in handling more than two domains. since different models should be built independently for every pair of image domains. To address this limitation. we propose StarGAN. a novel and scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations for multiple domains using only a single model. Such a unified model architecture of StarGAN allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network.

Change classification uses a machine learning classifier to determine whether a new software change is more similar to prior buggy changes or clean changes. In this manner. change classification predicts the existence of bugs in software changes. The classifier is trained using features (in the machine learning sense) extracted from the revision history of a software project stored in its software configuration management repository. The trained classifier can classify changes as buggy or clean. with a 78 percent accuracy and a 60 percent buggy change recall on average. Change classification has several desirable qualities: 1) The prediction granularity is small (a change to a single file). 2) predictions do not require semantic information about the source code. 3) the technique works for a broad array of project …,True,JE_m2UgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,618,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4408585/,16015809695858654263,/scholar?cites=16015809695858654263,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.219.2942&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The basic assumption is that faults do not occur in isolation. but rather in bursts of several related faults. Therefore. we cache locations that are likely to have faults: starting from the location of a known (fixed) fault. we cache the location itself. any locations changed together with the fault. recently added locations. and recently changed locations. By consulting the cache at the moment a fault is fixed. a developer can detect likely fault-prone locations. This is useful for prioritizing verification and validation resources on the most fault prone files or entities.

This remains an open problem but ubiquitous for domain adaptation. which can be caused by changes in sample selection criteria and application scenarios. We show that MMD cannot account for class weight bias and results in degraded domain adaptation performance. To address this issue. a weighted MMD model is proposed in this paper. Specifically. we introduce class-specific auxiliary weights into the original MMD for exploiting the class prior probability on source and target domains. whose challenge lies in the fact that the class label in target domain is unavailable.

The face recognition application of LPP is known to suffer from a number of problems including the small sample size (SSS) problem. the fact that it might produce statistically identical transform results for neighboring samples. and that its classification performance seems to be heavily influenced by its parameters. In this paper. we propose three novel solution schemes for LPP. Experimental results also show that the proposed LPP solution scheme is able to classify much more accurately than conventional LPP and to obtain a classification performance that is only little influenced by the definition of neighbor samples.,True,zOVgYQYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,218,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320310003122,4421638252405604059,/scholar?cites=4421638252405604059,,,http://www.yongxu.org/paper/LPP%20solution%20schemes%20for%20use%20with%20face%20recognition%20.pdf,0,0,0

This paper presents a dimensionality reduction method that fits SRC well. SRC adopts a class reconstruction residual-based decision rule. we use it as a criterion to steer the design of a feature extraction method. The method is thus called the SRC steered discriminative projection (SRC-DP). SRC-DP maximizes the ratio of between-class reconstruction residual to within-class reconstruction residual in the projected space and thus enables SRC to achieve better performance. SRC-DP provides low-dimensional representation of human faces to make the SRC-based face recognition system more efficient.

MSPCA can be viewed as a further extension of the classical principal component analysis (PCA). sparse PCA (SPCA) and the recently proposed multilinear PCA (MPCA). The key operation of MSPCA is to rewrite the MPCA into multilinear regression forms and relax it for sparse regression. Differing from the recently proposed MPCA. MSPCA inherits the sparsity from the SPCA and iteratively learns a series of sparse projections that capture most of the variation of the tensor data.

This paper gives an insight into SRC and seeks reasonable supports for its effectiveness. SRC uses L1-optimizer instead of L0-optimizer on account of computational convenience and efficiency. We re-examine the role of L1-optimizer and find that for pattern recognition tasks. L1-optimizer provides more classification meaningful information than L0-optimizer does. L0-optimizer can achieve sparsity only. whereas L1-optimizer can achieve closeness as well as sparsity. Sparsity determines a small number of nonzero representation coefficients. while closeness makes the nonzero representation coefficients concentrate on the training samples with the same class label as the given test sample.

We use a transformation matrix to transfer both the source and target data to a common subspace. where each target sample can be represented by a combination of source samples such that the samples from different domains can be well interlaced. In this way. the discrepancy of the source and target domains is reduced. By imposing joint low-rank and sparse constraints on the reconstruction coefficient matrix. the global and local structures of data can be preserved. To enlarge the margins between different classes as much as possible and provide more freedom to diminish the discrepancy. a flexible linear classifier (projection) is obtained by learning a non-negative label relaxation matrix that allows the strict binary label matrix to relax into a slack variable matrix.

In this paper we present a text-based framework for quantifying how diverse a document is in terms of its content. The proposed approach learns a topic model over a corpus of documents. and computes a distance matrix between pairs of topics using measures such as topic co-occurrence. These pairwise distance measures are then combined with the distribution of topics within a document to estimate each document's diversity relative to the rest of the corpus.

Some studies particularly emphasize the social networks of customers. Users' reviews and ratings of a product exert effects on other consumers' purchasing behavior. Whether a user refers to other users' ratings depends on the trust accorded by a user to the reviewer. On the other hand. the trust that is felt by a user for another user correlates with the similarity of two users' ratings. This bidirectional interaction that involves trust and rating is an important aspect of understanding consumer behavior in online communities because it suggests clustering of similar users and the evolution of strong communities.

CA; Cambridge. MA; London; AAAI Press; MIT Press; 1999,The exponential growth and reliability of Wikipedia have made it a promising data source for intelligent systems. The first challenge of Wikipedia is to make the encyclopedia machine-processable. In this study. we address the problem of extracting relations among entities from Wikipedia’s English articles. which in turn can serve for intelligent systems to satisfy users’ information needs. Our proposed method first anchors the appearance of entities in Wikipedia articles using some heuristic rules that are supported by their encyclopedic style. Therefore. it uses neither the Named Entity Recognizer (NER) nor the Coreference Resolution tool. which are sources of errors for relation extraction. It then classifies the relationships among entity pairs using SVM with features extracted from the web structure and subtrees mined from the syntactic structure of text. The innovations behind our work are the following: a) our method makes use of Wikipedia characteristics for entity allocation and entity classification. which are essential for relation extraction; b) our algorithm extracts a core tree. which accurately reflects a relationship between a given entity pair. and subsequently identifies key features with respect to the relationship from the core tree.

Object tracking. in general. is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion. changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene. nonrigid object structures. object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions. and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically. assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application.

When the object performs an action in 3D. the points on the outer boundary of the object are projected as 2D (x. y) contour in the image plane. A sequence of such 2D contours with respect to time generates a spatiotemporal volume (STV) in (x. y. t). which can be treated as 3D object in the (x. y. t) space. We analyze STV by using the differential geometric surface properties to identify action descriptors capturing both spatial and temporal properties. A set of action descriptors is called an action sketch. The first step in our approach is to generate STV by solving the point correspondence problem between consecutive frames. The correspondences are determined using a two-step graph theoretical approach.

This representation is compact. view-invariant. and is capable of explaining an action in terms of meaningful action units called dynamic instants and intervals. A dynamic instant is an instantaneous entity that occurs for only one frame. and represents an important change in the motion characteristics.

For each detected target. intensity and local standard deviation distributions are computed. and tracking is performed by computing the mean-shift vector that minimizes the distance between the kernel distribution for the target in the current frame and the model. In cases when the ego-motion of the sensor causes the target to move more than the operational limits of the tracking module. we perform a multi-resolution global motion compensation using the Gabor responses of the consecutive frames.

Traditional mean shift method requires a symmetric kernel. such as a circle or an ellipse. and assumes constancy of the object scale and orientation during the course of tracking. In a tracking scenario. it is not uncommon to observe objects with complex shapes whose scale and orientation constantly change due to the camera and object motions. In this paper. we present an object tracking method based on the asymmetric kernel mean shift. in which the scale and orientation of the kernel adaptively change depending on the observations at each iteration.

Due to the camera motion. the trajectories of the body parts contain not only the motion of the performing actor but also the motion of the camera. In addition to the camera motion. different viewpoints of the same action in different environments result in different trajectories. which can not be matched using standard approaches. In order to handle these problems. we propose to use the multi-view geometry between two actions. However. well known epipolar geometry of the static scenes where the cameras are stationary is not suitable for our task. Thus. we propose to extend the standard epipolar geometry to the geometry of dynamic scenes where the cameras are moving.

1276890,Object contour tracking using level sets,2004,Alper Yilmaz and Xin Li and Mubarak Shah,,Asian conference on computer vision,,,,High level vision tasks (recognition. understanding. etc.) for video processing require tracking of the complete contour of the objects. In general. objects undergo non-rigid deformations. which limit the applicability of using motion models (eg affine. projective) that impose rigidity constraints on the objects. In this paper. we propose a contour tracking algorithm for video captured using mobile cameras of different modalities. The proposed tracking algorithm uses Bayesian inference based on the probability density functions (PDFs) of texture and color features. These feature PDFs are fused in an independent opinion polling strategy. where the contribution of each feature is defined by its discrimination power. We formulate the evolution of the object contour as a variational calculus problem and solve the system using level sets. The associated energy functional combines region-based and boundary-based object segmentation approaches into one framework for object tracking in video. evaluated in the vicinity of the object contour. In this regard. it can be viewed as generalization of formerly proposed methods where the shortcomings of other methods (color. shape. gradient constraints. etc.) are overcome.

When an actor performs an action. at each time instant. the outer object boundary is projected to the image plane as a 2D contour. A sequence of such contours forms a 3D volume in the spatiotemporal space. The differential geometric analysis of the volume surface results in a set of action descriptors. These descriptors constitute the action sketch which is used to represent the human actions. The action sketch captures the changes in the shape and motion of the performing actor in an unified manner. Since the action sketch is obtained from the extrema of the differential geometric surface features. it is robust to viewpoint changes.

1276901,One-shot generalization in deep generative models,2016,Danilo* Rezende and Shakir* Mohamed and Ivo Danihelka and Karol Gregor and Daan Wierstra,,,,1521-1529,,Humans have an impressive ability to reason about new concepts and experiences from just a single example. In particular. humans have an ability for one-shot generalization: an ability to encounter a new concept. understand its structure. and then be able to generate compelling alternative variations of the concept. We develop machine learning systems with this important capacity by developing new deep generative models. models that combine the representational power of deep learning with the inferential power of Bayesian reasoning. We develop a class of sequential generative models that are built on the principles of feedback and attention. These two characteristics lead to generative models that are among the state-of-the art in density estimation and image generation. We demonstrate the one-shot generalization ability of our models using three tasks: unconditional sampling. generating new exemplars of a given concept. and generating new exemplars of a family of concepts. In all cases our models are able to generate compelling and diverse samples—having seen new examples just once—providing an important class of general-purpose models for one-shot machine learning.,True,cIlDEugAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,219,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/rezende16.html,16418227374416270076,/scholar?cites=16418227374416270076,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/rezende16.pdf,0,0,0

There has been much recent work on normalizing flows. ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review. we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design. and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly. we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling. approximate inference. and supervised learning.,True,cIlDEugAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,192,https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762,11750752849038281525,/scholar?cites=11750752849038281525,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02762,0,0,0
1276903,The cramer distance as a solution to biased wasserstein gradients,2017,Marc G Bellemare and Ivo Danihelka and Will Dabney and Shakir Mohamed and Balaji Lakshminarayanan and Stephan Hoyer and Rémi Munos,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.10743,,,,The Wasserstein probability metric has received much attention from the machine learning community. Unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence. which strictly measures change in probability. the Wasserstein metric reflects the underlying geometry between outcomes. The value of being sensitive to this geometry has been demonstrated. among others. in ordinal regression and generative modelling. In this paper we describe three natural properties of probability divergences that reflect requirements from machine learning: sum invariance. scale sensitivity. and unbiased sample gradients. The Wasserstein metric possesses the first two properties but. unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence. does not possess the third. We provide empirical evidence suggesting that this is a serious issue in practice. Leveraging insights from probabilistic forecasting we propose an alternative to the Wasserstein metric. the Cramér distance. We show that the Cramér distance possesses all three desired properties. combining the best of the Wasserstein and Kullback-Leibler divergences. To illustrate the relevance of the Cramér distance in practice we design a new algorithm. the Cramér Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). and show that it performs significantly better than the related Wasserstein GAN.,True,cIlDEugAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,187,https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10743,9730474053299423065,/scholar?cites=9730474053299423065,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10743,0,0,0

We present an improved minima controlled recursive averaging (IMCRA) approach. for noise estimation in adverse environments involving nonstationary noise. weak speech components. and low input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The noise estimate is obtained by averaging past spectral power values. using a time-varying frequency-dependent smoothing parameter that is adjusted by the signal presence probability. The speech presence probability is controlled by the minima values of a smoothed periodogram. The proposed procedure comprises two iterations of smoothing and minimum tracking.

As a result. the microphone signal has to be cleaned up with digital signal processing tools before it is stored. analyzed. transmitted. or played out. This cleaning process is often called noise reduction and this topic has attracted a considerable amount of research and engineering attention for several decades. One of the objectives of this book is to present in a common framework an overview of the state of the art of noise reduction algorithms in the single-channel (one microphone) case. The focus is on the most useful approaches. ie. filtering techniques (in different domains) and spectral enhancement methods. The other objective of Noise Reduction in Speech Processing is to derive all these well-known techniques in a rigorous way and prove many fundamental and intuitive results often taken for granted. This book is especially written for graduate students and research engineers who work on noise reduction for speech and audio applications and want to understand the subtle mechanisms behind each approach.

The beamformer satisfies two sets of linear constraints. One set is dedicated to maintaining the desired signals. while the other set is chosen to mitigate both the stationary and nonstationary interferences. Unlike classical beamformers. which approximate the RIRs as delay-only filters. we take into account the entire RIR [or its respective acoustic transfer function (ATF)].

Among microphone array structures the recently proposed general transfer function generalized sidelobe canceller (TF-GSC) has shown impressive noise reduction abilities in a directional noise field. while still maintaining low speech distortion.

We investigated the development of numerical estimation in a younger population (3.5-to 6.5-year-olds) using 0–100 and 2 novel sets of 1–10 and 1–20 number lines.

Although their link to the reading disorder remains contentious. recent empirical and computational studies suggest that spatial attention plays an important role in phonological decoding. The present behavioral study investigated exogenous spatial attention in dyslexic children and matched controls by measuring RTs to visual and auditory stimuli in cued-detection tasks.

Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can learn feature representations and model long-term temporal dependencies automatically. we propose an end-to-end fully connected deep LSTM network for skeleton based action recognition. Inspired by the observation that the co-occurrences of the joints intrinsically characterize human actions. we take the skeleton as the input at each time slot and introduce a novel regularization scheme to learn the co-occurrence features of skeleton joints.

Extracting discriminative spatial and temporal features to model the spatial and temporal evolutions of different actions plays a key role in accomplishing this task. In this work. we propose an end-to-end spatial and temporal attention model for human action recognition from skeleton data. We build our model on top of the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). which learns to selectively focus on discriminative joints of skeleton within each frame of the inputs and pays different levels of attention to the outputs of different frames. Furthermore. to ensure effective training of the network. we propose a regularized cross-entropy loss to drive the model learning process and develop a joint training strategy accordingly.

One main challenge lies in the large view variations in captured human actions. We propose a novel view adaptation scheme to automatically regulate observation viewpoints during the occurrence of an action. Rather than re-positioning the skeletons based on a human defined prior criterion. we design a view adaptive recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM architecture. which enables the network itself to adapt to the most suitable observation viewpoints from end to end. Extensive experiment analyses show that the proposed view adaptive RNN model strives to (1) transform the skeletons of various views to much more consistent viewpoints and (2) maintain the continuity of the action rather than transforming every frame to the same position with the same body orientation.

By combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a generative adversarial network (GAN) we can use learned feature representations in the GAN discriminator as basis for the VAE reconstruction objective. Thereby. we replace element-wise errors with feature-wise errors to better capture the data distribution while offering invariance towards eg translation. We apply our method to images of faces and show that it outperforms VAEs with element-wise similarity measures in terms of visual fidelity. Moreover. we show that the method learns an embedding in which high-level abstract visual features (eg wearing glasses) can be modified using simple arithmetic.,True,7VAwhzUAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC,1268,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/larsen16.html,3858681721182893389,/scholar?cites=3858681721182893389,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/larsen16.pdf,0,0,0

However deep models with several layers of dependent stochastic variables are difficult to train which limits the improvements obtained using these highly expressive models. We propose a new inference model. the Ladder Variational Autoencoder. that recursively corrects the generative distribution by a data dependent approximate likelihood in a process resembling the recently proposed Ladder Network. We show that this model provides state of the art predictive log-likelihood and tighter log-likelihood lower bound compared to the purely bottom-up inference in layered Variational Autoencoders and other generative models. We provide a detailed analysis of the learned hierarchical latent representation and show that our new inference model is qualitatively different and utilizes a deeper more distributed hierarchy of latent variables. Finally. we observe that batch normalization and deterministic warm-up (gradually turning on the KL-term) are crucial for training variational models with many stochastic layers.,True,7VAwhzUAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C,559,https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02282,1323199474868567922,/scholar?cites=1323199474868567922,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02282,0,0,0

This paper introduces stochastic recurrent neural networks which glue a deterministic recurrent neural network and a state space model together to form a stochastic and sequential neural generative model. The clear separation of deterministic and stochastic layers allows a structured variational inference network to track the factorization of the model's posterior distribution. By retaining both the nonlinear recursive structure of a recurrent neural network and averaging over the uncertainty in a latent path. like a state space model. we improve the state of the art results on the Blizzard and TIMIT speech modeling data sets by a large margin. while achieving comparable performances to competing methods on polyphonic music modeling.,True,7VAwhzUAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC,244,https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07571,8634151674822957659,/scholar?cites=8634151674822957659,,,"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07571.pdf,",0,0,0

However. little is known about the impact of changing growth rates. We used continuous cultures to control growth rate and studied the transcriptional program of the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. with generation times varying between 2 and 35 hours. A total of 5930 transcripts were identified at the different growth rates studied. Consensus clustering of these revealed that half of all yeast genes are affected by the specific growth rate. and that the changes are similar to those found when cells are exposed to different types of stress (>80% overlap). Genes with decreased transcript levels in response to faster growth are largely of unknown function (>50%) whereas genes with increased transcript levels are involved in macromolecular biosynthesis such as those that encode ribosomal proteins. This group also covers most targets of the transcriptional activator RAP1. which is also known to be involved in replication. A positive correlation between the location of replication origins and the location of growth-regulated genes suggests a role for replication in growth rate regulation. Our data show that the cellular growth rate has great influence on transcriptional regulation. This. in turn. implies that one should be cautious when comparing mutants with different growth rates. Our findings also indicate that much of the regulation is coordinated via the chromosomal location of the affected genes. which may be valuable information for the control of heterologous gene expression in metabolic engineering.,True,7VAwhzUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,230,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2006-7-11-r107,2605379960972364000,/scholar?cites=2605379960972364000,,,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2006-7-11-r107,0,0,0

We present the second Gaia data release. Gaia DR2. consisting of astrometry. photometry. radial velocities. and information on astrophysical parameters and variability. for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.< BR/> Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented. accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results.< BR/> Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release. which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness. performance. and richness of the data products.< BR/> Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources. parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the G BP (330-680 nm) and G RP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar …,True,xqa3JG8AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC,1248,https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_3207082,2479241359395723054,/scholar?cites=2479241359395723054,,,https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_3207082,0,0,0

1276981,The handbook of brain theory and neural networks,2003,Shunʼichi Amari,,,,,MIT press,"A new. dramatically updated edition of the classic resource on the constantly evolving fields of brain theory and neural networks. Dramatically updating and extending the first edition. published in 1995. the second edition of The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks presents the enormous progress made in recent years in the many subfields related to the two great questions: How does the brain work? and. How can we build intelligent machines? Once again. the heart of the book is a set of almost 300 articles covering the whole spectrum of topics in brain theory and neural networks. The first two parts of the book. prepared by Michael Arbib. are designed to help readers orient themselves in this wealth of material. Part I provides general background on brain modeling and on both biological and artificial neural networks. Part II consists of"" Road Maps"" to help readers steer through articles in part III on specific topics of interest. The articles in part III are written so as to be accessible to readers of diverse backgrounds. They are cross-referenced and provide lists of pointers to Road Maps. background material. and related reading. The second edition greatly increases the coverage of models of fundamental neurobiology. cognitive neuroscience. and neural network approaches to language. It contains 287 articles. compared to the 266 in the first edition. Articles on topics from the first edition have been updated by the original authors or written anew by new authors. and there are 106 articles on new topics.",True,rFaxB20AAAAJ:6QQEcPiluMcC,2110,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Av6qWhtw0-EC&oi=fnd&pg=PP13&dq=info:P1lS7YvGHSMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=hhNIcle6Sn&sig=z4-T6erlcu9Zzw7UzWmpb2fKqvQ,2530396869936437567,/scholar?cites=2530396869936437567,,,,0,0,0

BioASQ assesses the ability of systems to semantically index very large numbers of biomedical scientific articles. and to return concise and user-understandable answers to given natural language questions by combining information from biomedical articles and ontologies. The 2013 BioASQ competition comprised two tasks. Task 1a and Task 1b. In Task 1a participants were asked to automatically annotate new PubMed documents with MeSH headings. Twelve teams participated in Task 1a. with a total of 46 system runs submitted. and one of the teams performing consistently better than the MTI indexer used by NLM to suggest MeSH headings to curators. Task 1b used benchmark datasets containing 29 development and 282 test English questions. along with gold standard (reference) answers. prepared by a team of biomedical experts from around Europe and participants had to automatically produce answers. Three teams participated in Task 1b. with 11 system runs. The BioASQ infrastructure. including benchmark datasets. evaluation mechanisms. and the results of the participants and baseline methods. is publicly available.

Physical characteristics of inhaled particles and airway mucosal immunity determine which viruses and microbes will persist in the airways. Here we present the first metagenomic study of DNA viral communities in the airways of diseased and non-diseased individuals. We obtained sequences from sputum DNA viral communities in 5 individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 5 individuals without the disease. Overall. diversity of viruses in the airways was low. with an average richness of 175 distinct viral genotypes. The majority of viral diversity was uncharacterized. CF phage communities were highly similar to each other. whereas Non-CF individuals had more distinct phage communities. which may reflect organisms in inhaled air. CF eukaryotic viral communities were dominated by a few viruses. including human herpesviruses and retroviruses. Functional metagenomics showed that all Non-CF viromes were similar. and that CF viromes were enriched in aromatic amino acid metabolism. The CF metagenomes occupied two different metabolic states. probably reflecting different disease states. There was one outlying CF virome which was characterized by an over-representation of Guanosine-5′-triphosphate.3′-diphosphate pyrophosphatase. an enzyme involved in the bacterial stringent response. Unique environments like the CF airway can drive functional adaptations. leading to shifts in metabolic profiles. These results have important clinical implications for CF. indicating that therapeutic …,True,PGy8OwMAAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC,387,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007370,12191164654299934457,/scholar?cites=12191164654299934457,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007370,0,0,0

Using GPS tracking and observations on group movements. we studied the search strategy and information transfer in two of the most colonial seabirds. Guanay cormorants (Phalacrocorax bougainvillii) and Peruvian boobies (Sula variegata). Both species breed together and feed on the same prey. They do return to the same feeding zone from one trip to the next indicating high unpredictability in the location of food resources. We found that the Guanay cormorants use social information to select their bearing when departing the colony. They form a raft at the sea surface whose position is continuously adjusted to the bearing of the largest returning columns of cormorants. As such. the raft serves as a compass signal that gives an indication on the location of the food patches. Conversely. Peruvian boobies rely mainly on personal information based on memory to take heading at departure. They search for food patches solitarily or in small groups through network foraging by detecting the white plumage of congeners visible at long distance. Our results show that information transfer does occur and we propose a new mechanism of information transfer based on the use of rafts off colonies. The use of rafts for information transfer may be common in central place foraging colonial seabirds that exploit short lasting and/or unpredictably distributed food patches.

Turkish presents an interesting problem for statistical models as the potential tag set size is very large because of the productive derivational morphology. We propose to handle this by breaking up the morhosyntactic tags into inflectional groups. each of which contains the inflectional features for each (intermediate) derived form. Our statistical models score the probability of each morhosyntactic tag by considering statistics over the individual inflectional groups and surface roots in trigram models. Among the four models that we have developed and tested. the simplest model ignoring the local morphotactics within words performs the best. Our best trigram model performs with 93.95% accuracy on our test data getting all the morhosyntactic and semantic features correct.

However. how to combine several binary classifiers to optimize the whole routing process and how this process scales when it involves many different decisions (or classes) is a complex problem that has only received partial answers. We propose a global optimization process based on an optimal channel communication model that allows a combination of possibly heterogeneous binary classifiers.

These models are expressive and allow efficient computation of samples and derivatives. but cannot be used for computing likelihoods or for marginalization. The generative-adversarial training method allows to train such models through the use of an auxiliary discriminative neural network. We show that the generative-adversarial approach is a special case of an existing more general variational divergence estimation approach.

While this is a necessity in order to generalize beyond a given set of training images. it is also a very difficult problem due to the high variability of visual appearance within each class. In the last years substantial performance gains on challenging benchmark datasets have been reported in the literature. This progress can be attributed to two developments: the design of highly discriminative and robust image features and the combination of multiple complementary features based on different aspects such as shape. color or texture.

Optimization formulations and methods are proving to be vital in designing algorithms to extract essential knowledge from huge volumes of data. Machine learning. however. is not simply a consumer of optimization technology but a rapidly evolving field that is itself generating new optimization ideas. This book captures the state of the art of the interaction between optimization and machine learning in a way that is accessible to researchers in both fields. Optimization approaches have enjoyed prominence in machine learning because of their wide applicability and attractive theoretical properties. The increasing complexity. size. and variety of today's machine learning models call for the reassessment of existing assumptions. This book starts the process of reassessment. It describes the resurgence in novel contexts of established frameworks such as first-order methods. stochastic approximations. convex relaxations. interior-point methods. and proximal methods. It also devotes attention to newer themes such as regularized optimization. robust optimization. gradient and subgradient methods. splitting techniques. and second-order methods.

In this paper. we show that the requirement of absolute continuity is necessary: we describe a simple yet prototypical counterexample showing that in the more realistic case of distributions that are not absolutely continuous. unregularized GAN training is not always convergent. Furthermore. we discuss regularization strategies that were recently proposed to stabilize GAN training. Our analysis shows that GAN training with instance noise or zero-centered gradient penalties converges. On the other hand. we show that Wasserstein-GANs and WGAN-GP with a finite number of discriminator updates per generator update do not always converge to the equilibrium point. We discuss these results. leading us to a new explanation for the stability problems of GAN training. Based on our analysis. we extend our convergence results to more general GANs and prove local convergence for simplified gradient penalties even if the generator and data distributions lie on lower dimensional manifolds. We find these penalties to work well in practice and use them to learn high-resolution generative image models for a variety of datasets with little hyperparameter tuning.,True,7-B7aQkAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C,507,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/mescheder18a,11334901664651510839,/scholar?cites=11334901664651510839,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/mescheder18a/mescheder18a.pdf,0,0,0

1277041,Occupancy networks: Learning 3d reconstruction in function space,2019,Lars Mescheder and Michael Oechsle and Michael Niemeyer and Sebastian Nowozin and Andreas Geiger,,,,4460-4470,,With the advent of deep neural networks. learning-based approaches for 3D reconstruction have gained popularity. However. unlike for images. in 3D there is no canonical representation which is both computationally and memory efficient yet allows for representing high-resolution geometry of arbitrary topology. Many of the state-of-the-art learning-based 3D reconstruction approaches can hence only represent very coarse 3D geometry or are limited to a restricted domain. In this paper. we propose Occupancy Networks. a new representation for learning-based 3D reconstruction methods. Occupancy networks implicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of a deep neural network classifier. In contrast to existing approaches. our representation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolution without excessive memory footprint.

1277042,Pixeldefend: Leveraging generative models to understand and defend against adversarial examples,2017,Yang Song and Taesup Kim and Sebastian Nowozin and Stefano Ermon and Nate Kushman,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10766,,,,Adversarial perturbations of normal images are usually imperceptible to humans. but they can seriously confuse state-of-the-art machine learning models. What makes them so special in the eyes of image classifiers? In this paper. we show empirically that adversarial examples mainly lie in the low probability regions of the training distribution. regardless of attack types and targeted models. Using statistical hypothesis testing. we find that modern neural density models are surprisingly good at detecting imperceptible image perturbations. Based on this discovery. we devised PixelDefend. a new approach that purifies a maliciously perturbed image by moving it back towards the distribution seen in the training data. The purified image is then run through an unmodified classifier. making our method agnostic to both the classifier and the attacking method. As a result. PixelDefend can be used to protect already deployed models and be combined with other model-specific defenses. Experiments show that our method greatly improves resilience across a wide variety of state-of-the-art attacking methods. increasing accuracy on the strongest attack from 63% to 84% for Fashion MNIST and from 32% to 70% for CIFAR-10.,True,7-B7aQkAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC,393,https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10766,9269726813530152599,/scholar?cites=9269726813530152599,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10766,0,0,0
1277043,Structured learning and prediction in computer vision,2011,Sebastian Nowozin and Christoph H Lampert,6,,3-4,,Now publishers Inc,Powerful statistical models that can be learned efficiently from large amounts of data are currently revolutionizing computer vision. These models possess a rich internal structure reflecting task-specific relations and constraints. Structured Learning and Prediction in Computer Vision introduces the reader to the most popular classes of structured models in computer vision. The focus is on discrete undirected graphical models which are covered in detail together with a description of algorithms for both probabilistic inference and maximum a posteriori inference. It also discusses separately recently successful techniques for prediction in general structured models. The second part of Structured Learning and Prediction in Computer Vision describes methods for parameter learning. distinguishing the classic maximum likelihood based methods from the more recent prediction-based parameter learning methods. It highlights developments to enhance current models and discusses kernelized models and latent variable models. Throughout Structured Learning and Prediction in Computer Vision the main text is interleaved with successful computer vision applications of the explained techniques.

However. the quality of the resulting model crucially relies on the expressiveness of the inference model. We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB). a technique for training Variational Autoencoders with arbitrarily expressive inference models. We achieve this by introducing an auxiliary discriminative network that allows to rephrase the maximum-likelihood-problem as a two-player game. hence establishing a principled connection between VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We show that in the nonparametric limit our method yields an exact maximum-likelihood assignment for the parameters of the generative model. as well as the exact posterior distribution over the latent variables given an observation. Contrary to competing approaches which combine VAEs with GANs. our approach has a clear theoretical justification. retains most advantages of standard Variational Autoencoders and is easy to implement.,True,7-B7aQkAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC,363,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/mescheder17a.html,12656834929147362081,/scholar?cites=12656834929147362081,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/mescheder17a/mescheder17a.pdf,0,0,0

1277080,A sensitivity analysis of (and practitioners' guide to) convolutional neural networks for sentence classification,2017,Ye Zhang and Byron Wallace,,IJCNLP 2017,,,,Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently achieved remarkably strong performance on the practically important task of sentence classification (kim 2014. kalchbrenner 2014. johnson 2014). However. these models require practitioners to specify an exact model architecture and set accompanying hyperparameters. including the filter region size. regularization parameters. and so on. It is currently unknown how sensitive model performance is to changes in these configurations for the task of sentence classification. We thus conduct a sensitivity analysis of one-layer CNNs to explore the effect of architecture components on model performance; our aim is to distinguish between important and comparatively inconsequential design decisions for sentence classification. We focus on one-layer CNNs (to the exclusion of more complex models) due to their comparative simplicity and strong empirical performance. which makes it a modern standard baseline method akin to Support Vector Machine (SVMs) and logistic regression.

MGNC-CNN extracts features from input embedding sets independently and then joins these at the penultimate layer in the network to form a final feature vector. We then adopt a group regularization strategy that differentially penalizes weights associated with the subcomponents generated from the respective embedding sets.

1277084,Active Discriminative Text Representation Learning,2017,Ye Zhang and Matthew Lease and Byron C Wallace,,,,,AAAI 2017,We propose a new active learning (AL) method for text classification with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In AL. one selects the instances to be manually labeled with the aim of maximizing model performance with minimal effort. Neural models capitalize on word embeddings as representations (features). tuning these to the task at hand. We argue that AL strategies for multi-layered neural models should focus on selecting instances that most affect the embedding space (ie. induce discriminative word representations). This is in contrast to traditional AL approaches (eg. entropy-based uncertainty sampling). which specify higher level objectives. We propose a simple approach for sentence classification that selects instances containing words whose embeddings are likely to be updated with the greatest magnitude. thereby rapidly learning discriminative. task-specific embeddings. We extend this approach to document classification by jointly considering:(1) the expected changes to the constituent word representations; and (2) the model’s current overall uncertainty regarding the instance. The relative emphasis placed on these criteria is governed by a stochastic process that favors selecting instances likely to improve representations at the outset of learning. and then shifts toward general uncertainty sampling as AL progresses. Empirical results show that our method outperforms baseline AL approaches on both sentence and document classification tasks. We also show that. as expected. the method quickly learns discriminative word embeddings. To the best of our knowledge. this is the first work on AL addressing neural models for text …,True,MK9U6d4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,68,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10962,10421193188173368464,/scholar?cites=10421193188173368464,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10962/10821,0,0,0

When the training signal contains a variety of writing styles. such models may end up learning an'average'style that is directly influenced by the training data make-up and cannot be controlled by the needs of an application. We describe a family of model architectures capable of capturing both generic language characteristics via shared model parameters. as well as particular style characteristics via private model parameters. Such models are able to generate language according to a specific learned style. while still taking advantage of their power to model generic language phenomena. Furthermore. we describe an extension that uses a mixture of output distributions from all learned styles to perform on-the fly style adaptation based on the textual input alone.

Information subsidies are used to communicate newsworthy findings to journalists in an effort to earn mass media coverage and further disseminate health science research to mass audiences. Journal editors and news journalists then select which news stories receive coverage and thus public attention.Objective: This study aims to identify attributes of published health science articles that correlate with (1) journal editor issuance of press releases and (2) mainstream media coverage.Methods: We constructed four novel datasets to identify factors that correlate with press release issuance and media coverage. These corpora include thousands of published articles. subsets of which received press release or mainstream media coverage. We used statistical machine learning methods to identify correlations between words in the science abstracts and press release issuance and media coverage. Further. we used a topic modeling-based machine learning approach to uncover latent topics predictive of the perceived newsworthiness of science articles.Results: Both press release issuance for. and media coverage of. health science articles are predictable from corresponding journal article content.

Existing approaches are either top-down. which start from a gist of an image and convert it into words. or bottom-up. which come up with words describing various aspects of an image and then combine them. In this paper. we propose a new algorithm that combines both approaches through a model of semantic attention. Our algorithm learns to selectively attend to semantic concept proposals and fuse them into hidden states and outputs of recurrent neural networks.

Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections. measure economic indicators. and so on. Recently. social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large scale visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics. such as those in image tweets. so that prediction of sentiment from visual content is complementary to textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the needs in leveraging large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of image sentiment analysis. we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We first design a suitable CNN architecture for image sentiment analysis. We obtain half a million training samples by using a baseline sentiment algorithm to label Flickr images. To make use of such noisy machine labeled data. we employ a progressive strategy to fine-tune the deep network. Furthermore. we improve the performance on Twitter images by inducing domain transfer with a small number of manually labeled Twitter images.

1277101,Composition-preserving deep photo aesthetics assessment,2016,Long Mai and Hailin Jin and Feng Liu,,,,497-506,,Photo aesthetics assessment is challenging. Deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) methods have recently shown promising results for aesthetics assessment. The performance of these deep ConvNet methods. however. is often compromised by the constraint that the neural network only takes the fixed-size input. To accommodate this requirement. input images need to be transformed via cropping. scaling. or padding. which often damages image composition. reduces image resolution. or causes image distortion. thus compromising the aesthetics of the original images. In this paper. we present a composition-preserving deep ConvNet method that directly learns aesthetics features from the original input images without any image transformations. Specifically. our method adds an adaptive spatial pooling layer upon the regular convolution and pooling layers to directly handle input images with original sizes and aspect ratios. To allow for multi-scale feature extraction. we develop the Multi-Net Adaptive Spatial Pooling ConvNet architecture which consists of multiple sub-networks with different adaptive spatial pooling sizes and leverage a scene-based aggregation layer to effectively combine the predictions from multiple sub-networks.

In this work. a photosensitizer molecule. Chlorin e6 (Ce6). is loaded on polyethylene glycol (PEG)-functionalized graphene oxide (GO) via supramolecular π–π stacking. The obtained GO-PEG-Ce6 complex shows excellent water solubility and is able to generate cytotoxic singlet oxygen under light excitation for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Owing to the significantly enhanced intracellular trafficking of photosensitizers. our GO-PEG-Ce6 complex offers a remarkably improved cancer cell photodynamic destruction effect compared to free Ce6. More importantly. we show that the photothermal effect of graphene can be utilized to promote the delivery of Ce6 molecules by mild local heating when exposed to a near-infrared laser at a low power density. further enhancing the PDT efficacy against cancer cells …,True,dgk28GgAAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C,859,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn201560b,7532815352289608148,/scholar?cites=7532815352289608148,,,,0,0,0

Most computational approaches so far have explicitly used the fact that snoRNAs predominantly target ribosomal RNAs and spliceosomal RNAs. The target is specified by a short stretch of sequence complementarity between the snoRNA and its target. This sequence complementarity to known targets crucially contributes to sensitivity and specificity of snoRNA gene finding algorithms.The discovery of ‘orphan’ snoRNAs. which either have no known target. or which target ordinary protein-coding mRNAs. however. begs the question whether this class of ‘housekeeping’ non-coding RNAs is much more widespread and might have a diverse set of regulatory functions.

In order to construct an up-to-date catalog of human snoRNAs we have combined data from various databases. de novo prediction and extensive literature review. In total. we list more than 750 curated genomic loci that give rise to snoRNA and snoRNA-like genes. Utilizing small RNA-seq data from the ENCODE project. our study characterizes the plasticity of snoRNA expression identifying both constitutively as well as cell type specific expressed snoRNAs.

However. it still suffers from two problems: one is insufficient robustness to image noise. and the other is the Euclidean distance in FCM. which is sensitive to outliers. In this paper. we propose two new algorithms. generalized FCM (GFCM) and hierarchical FCM (HFCM). to solve these two problems. Traditional FCM can be considered as a linear combination of membership and distance from the expression of its mathematical formula. GFCM is generated by applying generalized mean on these two items. We impose generalized mean on membership to incorporate local spatial information and cluster information. and on distance function to incorporate local spatial information and image intensity value.

However. both the limited discriminability of local features and the BOW quantization errors will lead to many false local matches. which make it hard to distinguish similar images from copies. Geometric consistency verification is a popular technology for reducing the false matches. but it neglects global context information of local features and thus cannot solve this problem well. To address this problem. this paper proposes a global context verification scheme to filter false matches for copy detection.

Because of the nonlinearity introduced by the dead time. turn-on/off delay. snubber circuit and voltage drop across power devices. the output voltage of VSI inverters is distorted seriously in the low output voltage region. This distortion influences the output torque of IM motors for constant V/f drives. The nonlinearity of the inverter also causes 5th and 7th harmonic distortion in the line current when the distributed energy system operates in the grid-connected mode. i.e.. when the distributed energy system is parallel to a large power system through the VSI inverter.

In this study. we propose a novel automatic CAD system to distinguish abnormal brains from normal brains in MRI scanning. Methods: The proposed method simplifies the task to a binary classification problem. We used discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) to extract wavelet packet coefficients from MR brain images. Next. Shannon entropy (SE) and Tsallis entropy (TE) were harnessed to obtain entropy features from DWPT coefficients. Finally. generalized eigenvalue proximate support vector machine (GEPSVM). and GEPSVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel. were employed as classifier. We tested the four proposed diagnosis methods (DWPT+ SE+ GEPSVM. DWPT+ TE+ GEPSVM. DWPT+ SE+ GEPSVM+ RBF. and DWPT+ TE+ GEPSVM+ RBF) on three benchmark datasets of Dataset-66. Dataset-160. and Dataset-255. Results: The 10 repetition of K-fold stratified cross validation results showed the proposed DWPT+ TE+ GEPSVM+ RBF method excelled not only other three proposed classifiers but also existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy. In addition. the DWPT+ TE+ GEPSVM+ RBF method achieved accuracy of 100%. 100%. and 99.53% on Dataset-66. Dataset-160. and Dataset-255. respectively.

However. most of these trackers can hardly get top performance with real-time speed. In this paper. we propose the Siamese region proposal network (Siamese-RPN) which is end-to-end trained off-line with large-scale image pairs. Specifically. it consists of Siamese subnetwork for feature extraction and region proposal subnetwork including the classification branch and regression branch. In the inference phase. the proposed framework is formulated as a local one-shot detection task. We can pre-compute the template branch of the Siamese subnetwork and formulate the correlation layers as trivial convolution layers to perform online tracking. Benefit from the proposal refinement. traditional multi-scale test and online fine-tuning can be discarded. The Siamese-RPN runs at 160 FPS while achieving leading performance in VOT2015.

1277150,Distractor-aware siamese networks for visual object tracking,2018,Zheng Zhu and Qiang Wang and Bo Li and Wei Wu and Junjie Yan and Weiming Hu,,,,101-117,,Recently. Siamese networks have drawn great attention in visual tracking community because of their balanced accuracy and speed. However. features used in most Siamese tracking approaches can only discriminate foreground from the non-semantic backgrounds. The semantic backgrounds are always considered as distractors. which hinders the robustness of Siamese trackers. In this paper. we focus on learning distractor-aware Siamese networks for accurate and long-term tracking. To this end. features used in traditional Siamese trackers are analyzed at first. We observe that the imbalanced distribution of training data makes the learned features less discriminative. During the off-line training phase. an effective sampling strategy is introduced to control this distribution and make the model focus on the semantic distractors. During inference. a novel distractor-aware module is designed to perform incremental learning. which can effectively transfer the general embedding to the current video domain. In addition. we extend the proposed approach for long-term tracking by introducing a simple yet effective local-to-global search region strategy. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts. yielding 9.6% relative gain in VOT2016 dataset and 35.9% relative gain in UAV20L dataset.

An ideal normalization method is desired to be automatic. database independent and high-fidelity. where the face appearance should be preserved with little artifact and information loss. However. most normalization methods fail to satisfy one or more of the goals. In this paper. we propose a High-fidelity Pose and Expression Normalization (HPEN) method with 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) which can automatically generate a natural face image in frontal pose and neutral expression. Specifically. we firstly make a landmark marching assumption to describe the non-correspondence between 2D and 3D landmarks caused by pose variations and propose a pose adaptive 3DMM fitting algorithm. Secondly. we mesh the whole image into a 3D object and eliminate the pose and expression variations using an identity preserving 3D transformation.

1277162,A review of human activity recognition methods,2015,Michalis Vrigkas and Christophoros Nikou and Ioannis A Kakadiaris,2,,,28,Frontiers,Recognizing human activities from video sequences or still images is a challenging task due to problems such as background clutter. partial occlusion. changes in scale. viewpoint. lighting. and appearance. Many applications. including video surveillance systems. human-computer interaction. and robotics for human behavior characterization. require a multiple activity recognition system. In this work. we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances in the field of human activity classification. We propose a categorization of human activity methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular. we divide human activity classification methods into two large categories according to whether they use data from different modalities or not. Then. each of these categories is further analyzed into sub-categories. which reflect how they model human activities and what type of activities they are interested in. Moreover. we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing. publicly available human activity classification datasets and examine the requirements for an ideal human activity recognition dataset.

The unconstrained acquisition of data from uncooperative subjects may result in facial scans with significant pose variations along the yaw axis. Such pose variations can cause extensive occlusions. resulting in missing data. In this paper. a novel 3D face recognition method is proposed that uses facial symmetry to handle pose variations. It employs an automatic landmark detector that estimates pose and detects occluded areas for each facial scan. Subsequently. an Annotated Face Model is registered and fitted to the scan. During fitting. facial symmetry is used to overcome the challenges of missing data. The result is a pose invariant geometry image.

Inspired by the success of deep neural networks (DNN). we propose a DNN-based approach for End-to-End 3D FAce Reconstruction (UH-E2FAR) from a single 2D image. Different from recent works that reconstruct and refine the 3D face in an iterative manner using both an RGB image and an initial 3D facial shape rendering. our DNN model is end-to-end. and thus the complicated 3D rendering process can be avoided. Moreover. we integrate in the DNN architecture two components. namely a multi-task loss function and a fusion convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve facial expression reconstruction. With the multi-task loss function. 3D face reconstruction is divided into neutral 3D facial shape reconstruction and expressive 3D facial shape reconstruction. The neutral 3D facial shape is class-specific. Therefore. higher layer features are useful. In comparison. the expressive 3D facial shape favors lower or intermediate layer features. With the fusion-CNN. features from different intermediate layers are fused and transformed for predicting the 3D expressive facial shape.

The laboratory experiment was designed to test for the presence of unique physiological patterns in each of eight different emotions given a relatively motionless seated subject. intentionally feeling and expressing these states.

1277179,Learning transferable features with deep adaptation networks,2015,Mingsheng Long and Yue Cao and Jianmin Wang and Michael I. Jordan,,,,,,Recent studies reveal that a deep neural network can learn transferable features which generalize well to novel tasks for domain adaptation. However. as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the network. the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with increasing domain discrepancy. Hence. it is important to formally reduce the dataset bias and enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this paper. we propose a new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture. which generalizes deep convolutional neural network to the domain adaptation scenario. In DAN. hidden representations of all task-specific layers are embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embeddings of different domain distributions can be explicitly matched. The domain discrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multi-kernel selection method for mean embedding matching. DAN can learn transferable features with statistical guarantees. and can scale linearly by unbiased estimate of kernel embedding.

For a target task where labeled data is unavailable. domain adaptation can transfer a learner from a different source domain. In this paper. we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep networks that can jointly learn adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. We relax a shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assume that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function. We enable classifier adaptation by plugging several layers into deep network to explicitly learn the residual function with reference to the target classifier. We fuse features of multiple layers with tensor product and embed them into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to match distributions for feature adaptation. The adaptation can be achieved in most feed-forward models by extending them with new residual layers and loss functions. which can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Empirical evidence shows that the new approach outperforms state of the art methods on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.,True,_MjXpXkAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,808,https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04433,12070836061117770706,/scholar?cites=12070836061117770706,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04433,0,0,0
1277183,Conditional Adversarial Domain Adaptation,2018,Mingsheng Long and Zhangjie Cao and Jianmin Wang and Michael I Jordan,,,,,,Adversarial learning has been embedded into deep networks to learn disentangled and transferable representations for domain adaptation. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align different domains of multimodal distributions native in classification problems. In this paper. we present conditional adversarial domain adaptation. a principled framework that conditions the adversarial adaptation models on discriminative information conveyed in the classifier predictions. Conditional domain adversarial networks (CDANs) are designed with two novel conditioning strategies: multilinear conditioning that captures the cross-covariance between feature representations and classifier predictions to improve the discriminability. and entropy conditioning that controls the uncertainty of classifier predictions to guarantee the transferability. With theoretical guarantees and a few lines of codes. the approach has exceeded state-of-the-art results on five datasets.,True,_MjXpXkAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,531,https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10667,2516896454631091210,/scholar?cites=2516896454631091210,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10667,0,0,0
1277184,Transfer Joint Matching for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,2014,Mingsheng Long and Jianmin Wang and Guiguang Ding and Jiaguang Sun and Philip Yu,,,,,,Visual domain adaptation. which learns an accurate classifier for a new domain using labeled images from an old domain. has shown promising value in computer vision yet still been a challenging problem. Most prior works have explored two learning strategies independently for domain adaptation: feature matching and instance reweighting. In this paper. we show that both strategies are important and inevitable when the domain difference is substantially large. We therefore put forward a novel Transfer Joint Matching (TJM) approach to model them in a unified optimization problem. Specifically. TJM aims to reduce the domain difference by jointly matching the features and reweighting the instances across domains in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure. and construct new feature representation that is invariant to both the distribution difference and the irrelevant instances.

1277185,Deep Hashing Network for Efficient Similarity Retrieval,2016,Han Zhu and Mingsheng Long and Jianmin Wang and Yue Cao,,,,,,Due to the storage and retrieval efficiency. hashing has been widely deployed to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale multimedia retrieval. Supervised hashing. which improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting the semantic similarity on data pairs. has received increasing attention recently. For most existing supervised hashing methods for image retrieval. an image is first represented as a vector of hand-crafted or machine-learned features. followed by another separate quantization step that generates binary codes. However. suboptimal hash coding may be produced. because the quantization error is not statistically minimized and the feature representation is not optimally compatible with the binary coding. In this paper. we propose a novel Deep Hashing Network (DHN) architecture for supervised hashing. in which we jointly learn good image representation tailored to hash coding and formally control the quantization error. The DHN model constitutes four key components:(1) a sub-network with multiple convolution-pooling layers to capture image representations;(2) a fully-connected hashing layer to generate compact binary hash codes;(3) a pairwise cross-entropy loss layer for similarity-preserving learning; and (4) a pairwise quantization loss for controlling hashing quality. Extensive experiments on standard image retrieval datasets show the proposed DHN model yields substantial boosts over latest state-of-the-art hashing methods.,True,_MjXpXkAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,403,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10235,11984064786314134745,/scholar?cites=11984064786314134745,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10235/10094,0,0,0

Deep learning to hash. which improves retrieval quality by end-to-end representation learning and hash encoding. has received increasing attention recently.

We propose to condition imitation learning on high-level command input. At test time. the learned driving policy functions as a chauffeur that handles sensorimotor coordination but continues to respond to navigational commands. We evaluate different architectures for conditional imitation learning in vision-based driving. We conduct experiments in realistic three-dimensional simulations of urban driving and on a 1/5 scale robotic truck that is trained to drive in a residential area.

This paper shows that early fusion of shape and color. as is popular in image classification. leads to a significant drop in performance for object detection. Moreover. such approaches also yields suboptimal results for object categories with varying importance of color and shape. In this paper we propose the use of color attributes as an explicit color representation for object detection. Color attributes are compact. computationally efficient. and when combined with traditional shape features provide state-of-the-art results for object detection.

Road detection is of high relevance for autonomous driving. road departure warning. and supporting driver-assistance systems such as vehicle and pedestrian detection. The key for vision-based road detection is the ability to classify image pixels as belonging or not to the road surface. Identifying road pixels is a major challenge due to the intraclass variability caused by lighting conditions. A particularly difficult scenario appears when the road surface has both shadowed and nonshadowed areas. Accordingly. we propose a novel approach to vision-based road detection that is robust to shadows. The novelty of our approach relies on using a shadow-invariant feature space combined with a model-based classifier.

Recently. some authors have shown the advantages of using combinations of part/patch-based detectors in order to cope with the large variability of poses and the existence of partial occlusions. In this paper. we propose a pedestrian detection method that efficiently combines multiple local experts by means of a Random Forest ensemble. The proposed method works with rich block-based representations such as HOG and LBP. in such a way that the same features are reused by the multiple local experts. so that no extra computational cost is needed with respect to a holistic method. Furthermore. we demonstrate how to integrate the proposed approach with a cascaded architecture in order to achieve not only high accuracy but also an acceptable efficiency. In particular. the resulting detector operates at five frames per second using a laptop machine. We tested the proposed method with well-known challenging datasets such as Caltech. ETH.

The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios. but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper. we present SRGAN. a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge. it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this. we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition. we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN.

These delayed labels pose a challenge to data freshness in continuous training: fresh data may not have complete label information at the time they are ingested by the training algorithm.

Variances in the pose. scale or rotation usually make the problem more difficult. Most fine-grained classification systems follow the pipeline of finding foreground object or object parts (where) to extract discriminative features (what). In this paper. we propose to apply visual attention to fine-grained classification task using deep neural network. Our pipeline integrates three types of attention: the bottom-up attention that propose candidate patches. the object-level top-down attention that selects relevant patches to a certain object. and the part-level top-down attention that localizes discriminative parts. We combine these attentions to train domain-specific deep nets. then use it to improve both the what and where aspects. Importantly. we avoid using expensive annotations like bounding box or part information from end-to-end. The weak supervision constraint makes our work easier to generalize. We have verified the effectiveness of the method on the subsets of ILSVRC2012 dataset and CUB200_2011 dataset.

If the application does not need the sharing. then the operating system will become an unnecessary bottleneck to the application’s performance. This paper argues that applications should control sharing: the kernel should arrange each data structure so that only a single processor need update it. unless directed otherwise by the application. Guided by this design principle. this paper proposes three operating system abstractions (address ranges. kernel cores. and shares) that allow applications to control inter-core sharing and to take advantage of the likely abundance of cores by dedicating cores to specific operating system functions.Measurements of microbenchmarks on the Corey prototype operating system. which embodies the new abstractions. show how control over sharing can improve performance. Application benchmarks. using MapReduce and a Web server. show that the improvements can be significant for overall performance: MapReduce on Corey performs 25% faster than on Linux when using 16 cores. Hardware event counters confirm that these improvements are due to avoiding operations that are expensive on multicore machines.,True,k0KiE4wAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,515,https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi08/tech/full_papers/boyd-wickizer/boyd_wickizer.pdf,16282705959244932112,/scholar?cites=16282705959244932112,,,https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi08/tech/full_papers/boyd-wickizer/boyd_wickizer.pdf,0,0,0

1277227,ReVive: cost-effective architectural support for rollback recovery in shared-memory multiprocessors,2002,Milos Prvulovic and Zheng Zhang and Josep Torrellas,,,,111-122,IEEE,This paper presents ReVive. a novel general-purpose rollback recovery mechanism for shared-memory multiprocessors. ReVive carefully balances the conflicting requirements of availability. performance. and hardware cost. ReVive performs checkpointing. logging. and distributed parity protection. all memory-based. It enables recovery from a wide class of errors. including the permanent loss of an entire node. To maintain high performance. ReVive includes specialized hardware that performs frequent operations in the background. such as log and parity updates. To keep the cost low. more complex checkpointing and recovery functions are performed in software. while the hardware modifications are limited to the directory controllers of the machine. Our simulation results on a 16-processor system indicate that the average error-free execution time overhead of using ReVive is only 6.3%. while the achieved …,True,k0KiE4wAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,339,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/545214.545228,8278872867194188665,/scholar?cites=8278872867194188665,,,http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~milos/prvulovic_isca02.pdf,0,0,0

For these systems to function efficiently. their structures must fit that of the underlying network. Existing techniques for discovering network proximity information. such as landmark clustering and expanding-ring search are either inaccurate or expensive. The lack of global proximity information in overlay construction and maintenance can result in bad proximity approximation or excessive communication. To address these problems. we propose the following: (1) Combining landmark clustering and round-trip time (RTT) measurements to generate proximity information. achieving both efficiency and accuracy. (2) Controlled placement of global proximity information on the system itself as soft-state. such that nodes can independently access relevant information efficiently.

Strider is a black-box approach: without relying on specifications. it uses state differencing to identify potential causes of differing program behaviors. uses state tracing to identify actual. run-time state dependencies. and uses statistical behavior modeling for noise filtering. Strider is a state-based approach: instead of linking vague. high level descriptions and symptoms to relevant actions. it models management and support problems in terms of individual. named pieces of low level configuration state and provides precise mappings to user-friendly information through a computer genomics database. We use troubleshooting of configuration failures to demonstrate that the Strider approach reduces problem complexity by several orders of magnitude. making root-cause analysis possible.,True,k0KiE4wAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,236,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642304000760,2883133494177559538,/scholar?cites=2883133494177559538,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642304000760,0,0,0

Such systems are generally susceptible to collusion by groups of users in order to gain unfair advantages over others. While techniques have been proposed to combat Web spam collusion. there are few measurements of real collusion in deployed systems. In this paper. we report analysis and measurement results of user collusion in Maze. a large-scale peer-to-peer file sharing system with a non-net-zero point-based incentive policy. We search for colluding behavior by examining complete user logs. and incrementally refine a set of collusion detectors to identify common collusion patterns. We find collusion patterns similar to those found in Web spamming. We evaluate how proposed reputation systems would perform on the Maze system.

Traditional troubleshooting methods relying heavily on human intervention make the process inefficient and the results inaccurate even for solved problems. which contribute significantly to user's dissatisfaction.

The model makes no assumptions about how noise affects the signal. nor the existence of distinct noise environments.

Deep neural network acoustic models are now commonplace in HMM-based speech recognition systems. but building such systems is a complex. domain-specific task. Recent work demonstrated the feasibility of discarding the HMM sequence modeling framework by directly predicting transcript text from audio. This paper extends this approach in two ways.
