1058672,Air pollution from solid fuels.,2011,Sukesh Narayan Sinha and PK Nag,,,,46-52,In: Nriagu JO (Ed.) (Elsevier) encyclopedia of Environmental Health,Any alteration in the physical. chemical. and biological attributes of air causing adverse effects on human and other organisms is termed as air pollution. The substances contributing to air pollution are known as air pollutants. They can be natural or manmade. Pollutants can also be classified as either primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are the result of direct processes like volcanic eruptions. carbon mono-oxide from automobiles or sulfur dioxide from industries. Secondary pollutants are the result of the interaction of primary pollutants with air. An important example of a secondary pollutant is solid biomass fuel which includes such as coal. charcoal. wood. agricultural wastes. animal dung. shrubs. grass. straw. and so forth. Greater than 80% of the people living in urban areas have exposure to bad quality air that exceeds the World Health Organization (WHO) limits. Even though all the countries in the world are affected. it causes greater impact in low income developing countries. The latest Urban quality database shows that 98% of cities (3000 cities in 103 countries) in low and middle income countries with more than 100.000 inhabitants do not meet WHO air quality guidelines where as in high income countries it is only 56%. Declining in the urban quality air causes the risk of stroke. heart disease. lung cancer and chronic and acute respiratory diseases like asthma (Source: WHO Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution. 2016). Concerns have been raised to control air pollution in the developing as well as the developed world.

Therefore the insecticides/pesticides and herbicides have been used in India for agriculture setting. In this connection a sensitive method for the quantification of 5 pesticides in drinking water samples to the µgL–1 level has been developed. The paper also describes the effect of dissociation energy on ion formation and sensitivity of pesticides in water samples. The structure. ion formations. distribution of base peak and fragmentation schemes were correlated with the different dissociation energies. The new ion was obtained at different mass to charge ratio. which was the characteristic ion peak of targeted pesticide. Additionally. a simple solvent lyophilization followed by selective analysis using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was used. This method was accurate (≥98%) as it possesses limits of detection in the 6 - 38 ngL–1 range. and the percentage relative standard deviations are less than 8.62% at the low µgL–1 end of the method’s linear range.

The enzyme was homogenized at 75 and 150 MPa and the effects were evaluated with respect to the enzyme activity. stability. kinetic parameters and molecular structure. The enzyme showed a pH-dependent response to the HPH treatment. with reduction or maintenance of activity at pH 4.5–6.0 and a remarkable activity increase (30–300%) at pH 6.5 in all tested temperatures (15. 50 and 75°C). The enzyme thermal tolerance was reduced due to HPH treatment and the storage for 24 h at high temperatures (50 and 75°C) also caused a reduction of activity. Interestingly. at lower temperatures (15°C) the activity levels were slightly higher than that observed for native enzyme or at least maintained. These effects of HPH treatment on function and stability of GO were further investigated by spectroscopic methods.

The most common non-communicable diseases are obesity. diabetes. cancer. and cardiovascular. chronic respiratory and neurological diseases. Altogether. they are the commonest cause of death and disability in modern world. Recent investigations show that many of these diseases share common pathophysiological mechanisms and are. at least in part. different manifestations in different organs of similar molecular alterations. Mitochondrial alterations. oxidative stress and inflammation are inextricably linked and play major roles in the onset and development of non-communicable diseases.

PON2. and PON3. play an important role in decreasing oxidative stress by degrading lipid peroxides. PON1 synthesis is upregulated by PPAR. Several pharmacological compounds (acting as antioxidants and. hence. atheroprotective) stimulate both PPAR activity and PON1 expression. Recent evidence suggests that PON1 and the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are involved in coordinating the inflammatory response in damaged tissues; PPAR may be central in the regulation of these biochemical pathways. This article reviews the state of knowledge on PON1 biochemistry and function. the influence of genetic variation. and the regulation of PON1 expression by pharmaceutical compounds that increase PPAR activity.

The paraoxonases (PON) are a group of antioxidant enzymes. termed PON1. PON2. and PON3 that protect lipoproteins and cells from peroxidation and. as such. may be involved in protection against the atherosclerosis process. PON1 inhibits the production of chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in endothelial cells incubated with oxidized lipoproteins. PON1 and CCL2 are ubiquitously distributed in tissues. and this suggests a joint localization and combined systemic effect. The aim of the present study has been to analyze the quantitative immunohistochemical localization of PON1. PON3. CCL2 and CCL2 receptors in a series of patients with severe PAD. Portions of femoral and/or popliteal arteries from 66 patients with PAD were obtained during surgical procedures for infra-inguinal limb revascularization. We used eight normal arteries from donors as controls. PON1 and PON3. CCL2 and the chemokine-binding protein 2. and Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor. were increased in PAD patients.

In turn. inflammation. oxidation. and metabolism are associated with the course of these diseases; mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be at the crossroads of mutual relationships. The migration of immune cells during inflammation is governed by the interaction between chemokines and chemokine receptors. Chemokines. especially C-C-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). have a variety of additional functions that are involved in the maintenance of normal metabolism. It is our hypothesis that a ubiquitous and continuous secretion of CCL2 may represent an animal model of low-grade chronic inflammation that. in the presence of an energy surplus. could help to ascertain the afore-mentioned relationships and/or to search for specific therapeutic approaches.

Based on spirometric analysis. they were segregated into two groups. 110 (64%) with COPD and 62 (36%) without COPD. Corneal endothelial cell morphology was examined by widefield noncontact specular microscopy. which allows measurements of endothelial cell density (ECD). hexagonality. and endothelial cell size coefficient of variation (ECCV). Corneal thickness was measured by noncontact pachimetry. PON1 and plasma TNFα concentrations were analyzed by ELISA. Serum PON1 activity was analyzed by spectrophotometry.Results.: Patients with COPD had significant decreases in ECD. hexagonality. and corneal thickness. and a significant increase in ECCV. They also had significant decreases in serum PON1 activity but not in PON1 concentration. Serum PON1 activity showed a significant direct association with ECD. and an inverse association with corneal thickness.Conclusions.: Results of the present study suggest that PON1 may be involved in the pathophysiology of corneal endothelial alterations in patients with COPD.,True,-AiYk8MAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,17,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2129009,17874970878890861282,/scholar?cites=17874970878890861282,,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2129009,0,0,0

Metformin is a strong candidate to be incorporated in alternative therapeutic approaches. We used a targeted metabolomic approach to assess changes related to the multi-faceted metabolic disturbances provoked by HFD. We evaluated the protective effects of metformin and explored how pro-inflammatory and metabolic changes respond when mice rendered obese. glucose-intolerant and hyperlipidemic were switched to diet reversal with or without metformin. Mice treated with metformin and diet-reversal showed a dramatically improved protection against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. a beneficial effect that was accompanied by a lowering of liver-infiltrating pro-inflammatory macrophages and lower release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Metformin combined with diet reversal promoted effective weight loss along with better glucose control. lowered levels of circulating cholesterol and triglycerides. and reduced adipose tissue content. Our findings underscored the ability of metformin to target the contribution of branched chain amino acids to adipose tissue metabolism while suppressing mitochondrial-dependent biosynthesis in hepatic tissue. The relationship between adipose tissue and liver might provide clinical potential for combining metformin and dietary modifications to protect against the metabolic damage occurring upon excessive dietary fat intake.

The activity of this enzyme has been shown to be decreased in breast cancer (BC) patients. The aims of our study were to investigate the changes produced by radiotherapy (RT) on activity and concentration of serum PON1 in BC patients. and to evaluate the observed variations in relation to clinical and pathological characteristics of patients and tumors. and the response to treatment. We studied 200 women with BC who were scheduled to receive RT following excision of the tumor. Blood for analyses was obtained before and after the irradiation procedure. The control group was composed of 200 healthy women. Relative to control. BC patients had significantly lower serum PON1 activities pre-RT. while PON1 concentrations were at similar levels. RT was associated with a significant increase in serum PON1 activities and concentrations. We observed significant differences in serum PON1 concentrations post-RT between patients with luminal A or luminal B tumors. Serum PON1 concentration post-RT was markedly lower in BC patients with metastases. We conclude that benefit from RT accrues to the BC patients not only through its direct effect on cancer cells but also indirectly by improving the organism’s anti-oxidant defense mechanisms. In addition. our preliminary evidence suggests that the measurement of serum PON1 concentration post-RT could be an efficient prognostic biomarker. and may be used as an index of the efficacy of the RT.,True,-AiYk8MAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,10,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188633,8527617234700773178,/scholar?cites=8527617234700773178,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188633,0,0,0

However. after a decade of research. little is known about these proteins. In humans. at least five different DING proteins have been identified. which were implicated in important biological processes and diseases. including HIV. Indeed. recent data from different research groups have highlighted the anti-HIV activity of some DING representatives. These proteins share the ability to inhibit the transcriptional step of HIV-1. a key step of the viral cycle that is not yet targeted by the current therapies. Since such proteins have been isolated from humans. we undertook a comprehensive study that focuses on the relationship between these proteins and HIV-infection in an infectious context. Hence. we developed a home-made ELISA for the quantification of the concentration of DING proteins in human serum. Using this method. we were able to determine the concentration of DING proteins in healthy and HIV-infected patients. Interestingly. we observed a significant increase of the concentration of DING proteins in non treated and treated HIV-infected patients compared to controls. In addition. cell cultures infected with HIV also show an increased expression of DING proteins. ruling out the possible role of antiretroviral treatment in the increase of the expression of DING proteins.

Activated PA can then assemble into one of two noninterconverting oligomers. a homoheptamer and a homooctamer. which have unique properties. Herein we describe molecular determinants that influence the stoichiometry of PA in toxin complexes. By tethering PA domain 4 (D4) to domain 2 with two different-length cross-links. we can control the relative proportions of PA heptamers and octamers. The longer cross-link favors octamer …,True,mxKQbn0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,26,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283611011727,1651805567933531658,/scholar?cites=1651805567933531658,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249527/,0,0,0

The recent availability of X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) light sources has opened the door to a new and revolutionary approach to performing X-ray analysis of these important biomolecules. Recent advances in sample delivery. data reduction. and phasing have enabled the high-resolution structural probing of membrane proteins at room temperature.

1058828,Molecular Mechanisms of Anthrax Toxin Assembly and Transport,2012,Geoffrey Keith Feld,,,,,,Because proteins carry out their cellular functions in specific locations. protein transport represents a crucial step in the central dogma of biochemistry. Transport across a membrane barrier requires energy; therefore. nature has provided a class of molecular machines known as translocases that catalyze protein translocation. Often. these machines contain channels that are too narrow to transport a folded protein; thus. substrate unfolding adds another layer of complexity to the poorly understood transport mechanism. The anthrax toxin system represents a useful model for elucidating the mechanisms of translocation-coupled protein unfolding. both in terms of structure and function.In order to understand the mechanism by which an unfolding machine interacts with its substrate. the X-ray structure of an anthrax protective antigen (PA) oligomer prechannel was solved in complex with the amino-terminal PA-binding domain of the substrate lethal factor (LFN). The structure revealed how PA interacts with unfolded polypeptide via a hydrophobic cleft we call the &alpha clamp. Working with my colleague. Katie Thoren. we show how the &alpha clamp is critical for toxin assembly. substrate binding. unfolding. and translocation through a nonspecific binding mechanism.The recent discovery that PA can form two oligomeric states exemplifies the complexity of multimeric protein nanomachine assembly. In order to better understand the molecular mechanism of heterogenous assembly. a series of PA constructs with varying length crosslinks was produced. their structures were solved to high resolution. and their assembly products were analyzed by electron …,True,mxKQbn0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,1,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3hm635k0,15832011003958329243,/scholar?cites=15832011003958329243,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt3hm635k0/qt3hm635k0.pdf,0,0,0

February 23. 2010 these conditions. the predominant toxin complex that assembles is octameric. Incubation in blood causes heptameric LT complexes to lose greater than 90% cytotoxicity. whereas octameric LT complexes retain their activity. To understand the molecular mechanism of the apparent differential loss of toxin activity. we determined the pH-threshold of conversion to the channel state for each oligomeric complex. We find that the octameric toxin has a lower pH-threshold for channel formation than the heptamer. A consequence of this is that heptamers are inactivated by premature conversion to the channel state. whereas the octamers remain in the functional prechannel state. We propose that assembly of two oligomeric Atx complexes may provide a regulation mechanism for anthrax toxin cytotoxicity in both assembly at cell-surfaces and in the bloodstream.

1058891,Disruption of a Quorum Sensing mechanism triggers tumorigenesis: a simple discrete model corroborated by experiments in mammary cancer stem cells,2010,Zvia Agur and Yuri Kogan and Liora Levi and Hannah Harrison and Rebecca Lamb and Oleg U Kirnasovsky and Robert B Clarke,5,Biology direct,1,1-11,BioMed Central,The balance between self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells is expected to be tightly controlled in order to maintain tissue homeostasis throughout life. also in the face of environmental hazards. Theory. predicting that homeostasis is maintained by a negative feedback on stem cell proliferation. implies a Quorum Sensing mechanism in higher vertebrates. Application of this theory to a cellular automata model of stem cell development in disrupted environments shows a sharply dichotomous growth dynamics: maturation within 50-400 cell cycles. or immortalization. This dichotomy is mainly driven by intercellular communication. low intensity of which causes perpetual proliferation. Another driving force is the cells' kinetic parameters. Reduced tissue life span of differentiated cells results in uncontrolled proliferation. Model's analysis. showing that under the Quorum Sensing control. stem cell fraction within a steady state population is fixed. is corroborated by experiments in breast carcinoma cells. Experimental results show that the plating densities of CD44+ cells and of CD44+/24lo/ESA+ cells do not affect stem cell fraction near confluence. This study suggests that stem cell immortalization may be triggered by reduced intercellular communication. rather than exclusively result from somatic evolution. and implies that stem cell proliferation can be attenuated by signal manipulation. or enhanced by cytotoxics targeted to differentiated cells. In vivo verification and identification of the Quorum Sensing mediating molecules will pave the way to a higher level control of stem cell proliferation in cancer and in tissue engineering.

In contrast. palmitic-acid esterified to the sn-2 position (beta-palmitate). the main palmitate conformation in human milk fat. is well absorbed. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of high alpha. alpha’-palmitate fat (HAPF) diet and high beta-palmitate fat (HBPF) diet on colitis development in Muc2 deficient (Muc2−/−) mice. a well-described animal model for spontaneous enterocolitis due to the lack of a protective mucus layer.  Methods Muc2−/− mice received AIN-93G reference diet. HAPF diet or HBPF diet for 5 weeks after weaning. Clinical symptoms. intestinal morphology and inflammation in the distal colon were analyzed.  Results Both HBPF diet and AIN-93G diet limited the extent of intestinal erosions and morphological damage in Muc2−/− mice compared with HAPF diet. In addition. the immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cell response as demonstrated by the up-regulation of Foxp3. Tgfb1 and Ebi3 gene expression levels was enhanced by HBPF diet compared with AIN-93G and HAPF diets. HBPF diet also increased the gene expression of Pparg and enzymatic antioxidants (Sod1.

Formula fed infants were assigned to receive a formula with high sn-2-palmitate (40% of the palmitic acid is esterified to the sn-2 position of the triglyceride).Results: Anthropometric measurements of growth were done at randomization. and at 6 and 12 weeks postnatal age. Three-day records were completed by parents on stool characteristics and infants’ wellbeing; face-to-face interviews were conducted according to a structured questionnaire. At 6 and 12 weeks of age. all infants presented normal growth parameters. Hard stools were not reported in both groups; however. the FF infants had less stools per day and a lower stool consistency score. The formula fed infants cried longer compared to the breastfed infants. There were no significant differences between the two groups in adverse effects.Conclusions: The formula containing high sn-2 palmitate had similar effect to breastfeeding on body growth. prevention of hard stools. and maintaining wellbeing in Chinese term infants.

While molecular imprinting technology (MIT) has found success when imprinting small molecules. progress in MIT for biomacromolecules. such as polypeptides and proteins. is hindered. in part due to their large size and complex functionality. Unlike with small molecules. imprinting of biomacromolecules results in poor performance of the imprinted gel. characterized by significant nonspecific binding of molecules of similar shape and size to the template. Our research in this field aims to characterize the structure of protein-imprinted gels in an effort clarify the effects that lead to poor protein imprinting.The determination and study of the three dimensional molecular structure of such supramolecular assemblies is a challenging problem. To gain a general understanding of the process. we focus on simplified coarse-grained lattice models that are known to capture some generic and universal properties of polymer gels and biopolymers. The protein and imprinting matrix are modeled using coarse-grained lattice techniques. where gelation is simulated using a modified kinetic gelation algorithm. Structural and functional properties are probed using protein diffusion within the gel. Different gelation conditions are considered and analyzed for imprinting performance.

There is limited data on DNA binding potential of Tau. We provide novel evidence on nicking of DNA by Tau. Tau nicks the supercoiled DNA leading to open circular and linear forms. The metal ion magnesium (a co-factor for endonuclease) enhanced the Tau DNA nicking ability. while an endonuclease specific inhibitor. aurinetricarboxylic acid (ATA) inhibited the Tau DNA nicking ability. Further. we also evidenced that Tau induces B–C–A mixed conformational transition in DNA and also changes DNA stability. Tau–scDNA complex is more sensitive to DNAse I digestion indicating stability changes in DNA caused by Tau. These findings indicate that Tau alters DNA helicity and integrity and also nicks the DNA.

P3) that terminate predominantly at residues 40 and 42. A number of γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs). such as N-[N-(3.5-Difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT). have been developed with the goal of reducing Aβ to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although most studies show that DAPT inhibits Aβ in a dose-dependent manner several studies have also detected a biphasic effect with an unexpected increase at low doses of DAPT in cell cultures. animal models and clinical trials. In this article. we confirm the increase in Aβ40 and Aβ42 in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells treated with low doses of DAPT and identify one of the mechanisms for this paradox. We studied the pathway by first demonstrating that stimulation of Aβ. a product of γ-secretase. was accompanied by a parallel increase of its substrate CTFβ. thereby demonstrating that the inhibitor was not anomalously stimulating enzyme activity at low levels. Secondly. we have demonstrated that inhibition of an Aβ degrading activity. endothelin converting enzyme (ECE). yielded more Aβ. but abolished the DAPT-induced stimulation. Finally. we have demonstrated that Aα. which is generated in the secretory pathway before endocytosis. is not subject to the DAPT-mediated stimulation.

Retinol-Binding Protein 4 (RBP4) antagonists reduce serum retinol concentrations thus partially reducing retinol delivery to the retina which decreases bisretinoid synthesis. BPN-14136 is a novel RBP4 antagonist with good in vitro potency and selectivity and optimal rodent pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics. To select a non-rodent species for regulatory toxicology studies. we conducted PK and PD evaluation of BPN-14136 in dogs and non-human primates (NHP). PK properties were determined following oral and intravenous administration of BPN-14136 in beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys. Dynamics of plasma RBP4 reduction in response to compound administration was used as a PD marker. BPN-14136 exhibited favorable PK profile in both species. Dose-normalized exposure was significantly higher in NHP than in dog. Baseline concentrations of RBP4 were considerably lower in dog than in NHP. reflecting the atypical reliance of canids on non-RBP4 mechanisms of retinoid trafficking. Oral administration of BPN-14136 to NHP induced a strong 99% serum RBP4 reduction. Dynamics of RBP4 lowering in both species correlated with compound exposure. Despite adequate PK and PD characteristics of BPN-14136 in dog. reliance of canids on non-RBP4 mechanisms of retinoid trafficking precludes evaluation of on-target toxicities for RBP4 antagonists in this species.

In rats. 14-OMeC6SU showed stronger antinociceptive effect in the tail-flick assay than codeine and was equipotent to morphine. whereas C6SU was less efficacious after subcutaneous (sc) administration. Following intracerebroventricular injection. 14-OMeC6SU was more potent than morphine. In the Complete Freund’s Adjuvant-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia. 14-OMeC6SU and C6SU in sc doses up to 6.1 and 13.2 µmol/kg. respectively. showed peripheral antihyperalgesic effect. because co-administered naloxone methiodide. a peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonist antagonized the measured antihyperalgesia.

Emerging evidence reveals that cells monitor the levels of acetyl-CoA as a key indicator of their metabolic state. through distinctive protein acetylation modifications dependent on this metabolite. We offer the following conceptual model for understanding the role of this sentinel metabolite in metabolic regulation. High nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA amounts are a signature of a ‘growth’ or ‘fed’ state and promote its utilization for lipid synthesis and histone acetylation. In contrast. under ‘survival’ or ‘fasted’ states. acetyl-CoA is preferentially directed into the mitochondria to promote mitochondrial-dependent activities such as the synthesis of ATP and ketone bodies.

Previous studies using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that upon entry into stationary phase. a quiescent cell population emerges that is heavier in density than nonquiescent cells. Here. we show that total intracellular trehalose and glycogen content exhibits substantial correlation with the density of individual cells both in stationary phase batch cultures and during continuous growth.

The human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. for example. can enter a reversible state of dormancy in which it is metabolically active. but does not increase in number. and which is believed to enable its survival in the human host for years. with attendant risk for reactivation to active tuberculosis. Driven by the need to combat mycobacterial diseases like tuberculosis. efforts to understand such adaptations have benefitted in recent years from application of activity-based probes. These studies have been inspired by the potential of these chemical tools to uncover protein function for previously unannotated proteins. track shifts in protein activity as a function of environment. and provide a streamlined method for screening and …,True,U6pV-M0AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/82_2018_125,16743882943596815088,/scholar?cites=16743882943596815088,,,0,0,0

LprG is a cell wall protein that is required for the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is associated with lipid transport to the outer lipid layer or mycomembrane. Motivated by available cocrystal structures of LprG with lipids. we searched for potential inhibitors of LprG by performing a computational docking screen of ∼250 000 commercially available small molecules. We identified several structurally related dimethylaminophenyl hydrazides that bind to LprG with moderate micromolar affinity and inhibit mycobacterial growth in a LprG-dependent manner. We found that mutation of F123 within the binding cavity of LprG conferred resistance to one of the most potent …,True,U6pV-M0AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,1,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00497,5454098488413300303,/scholar?cites=5454098488413300303,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7436943/,0,0,0

1059084,Transport of outer membrane lipids in mycobacteria Molecular and cell biology of lipids,2017,Megan H Touchette and Jessica C Seeliger,,,,,,The complex organization of the mycobacterial cell wall poses unique challenges for the study of its assembly. Although mycobacteria are classified evolutionarily as Gram-positive bacteria. their cell wall architecture more closely resembles that of Gram-negative organisms. They possess not only an inner cytoplasmic membrane. but also a bilayer outer membrane that encloses an aqueous periplasm and includes diverse lipids that are required for the survival and virulence of pathogenic species. Questions surrounding how mycobacterial outer membrane lipids are transported from where they are made in the cytoplasm to where they function at the cell exterior are thus similar. and similarly compelling. to those that have driven the study of Gram-negative outer membrane transport pathways. However. little is understood about these processes in mycobacteria. Here we contextualize these questions by comparing our current knowledge of mycobacteria with better-defined systems in other organisms. Based on this analysis. we propose possible models and highlight continuing challenges to improving our understanding of outer membrane assembly in these medically and environmentally important bacteria.

Soc,,,,Allostery enables tight regulation of protein function in the cellular environment. Although existing models of allostery are firmly rooted in the current structure–function paradigm. the mechanistic basis for allostery in the absence of structural change remains unclear. In this study. we show that a typical globular protein is able to undergo significant changes in volume under native conditions while exhibiting no additional changes in protein structure. These native state volume fluctuations were found to correlate with changes in internal motions that were previously recognized as a source of allosteric entropy. This finding offers a novel mechanistic basis for allostery in the absence of canonical structural change. The unexpected observation that function can be derived from expanded. low density protein states has broad implications for our understanding of allostery and suggests that the general concept of the native …,True,MZPjd_MAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,26,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b12058,985972766672654423,/scholar?cites=985972766672654423,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1373407,0,0,0

However. it is still unclear whether and how intact AAT inhibits HIV-1 infection. It is also unknown what the mechanism of AAT is and which critical step(s) are involved. In the present study. the C-terminus of AAT (C) was synthesized. C terminus-truncated AAT (ΔAAT) was also prepared by digesting AAT with metalloproteinase. Primary CD4+ T cells were then co-cultured with HIV-1 with the presence or absence of AAT/C/ΔAAT to detect cis-infection of HIV-1. The interaction between AAT/C/ΔAAT and gp120/gp41 was also measured.

While patients with ANE syndrome have fewer mature ribosomes. it is unclear how this mutation disrupts ribosome assembly. Here we use yeast as a model system and show that the mutation confers growth and pre-rRNA processing defects. Recently. we found that Nop4 is a hub protein in the nucleolar large subunit (LSU) processome interactome.

Circular dichroism and NMR demonstrate that the ANE syndrome mutation in RRM3 of human RBM28 disrupts domain folding.

While the retention of all-trans-BC in porridges (69 to 93%) and chapatis (70 to 97%) varied between the processors. there was no overall difference between the two products and this was probably because of the variability in FC. BC retention in mandazis was similar to that of chapatis and porridges. Processing in FC significantly increased the amount of cis-isomers. in particular 13-cis-BC.

1059202,Investigating carotenoid loss after drying and storage of orange-fleshed sweet potato,2010,Aurélie Bechoff,,,,,,Biofortified orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) is being promoted to tackle vitamin A deficiency. a serious public health problem affecting children and pregnant/lactating women in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of the study was to quantify and understand the factors influencing carotenoid losses in dried OFSP. Losses were determined in chips after drying and storage. A preliminary study demonstrated that carotenoid levels were not significantly different following either solar or sun drying. Carotenoid loss after drying was generally correlated with high initial moisture content and high carotenoid content in fresh sweetpotato roots. Losses of pro-vitamin A were less than 35% in all cases. Flour made from OFSP could therefore be a significant source of provitamin A. In contrast. storage of chips at room temperature in Uganda and Mozambique for four months resulted in high losses of pro-vitamin A (ca. 70-80% loss from the initial dried product). Low-cost pre-treatments. such as blanching. antioxidants and salting. did not reduce carotenoid losses during storage. Enzymatic catabolism of b-carotene in dried OFSP was considered unlikely because of low peroxidase activities at low water activities and the loss of peroxidase activity during storage. To understand further the factors causing the losses. dried sweet potato chips were stored under controlled conditions of temperature (10; 20; 30; or 40ºC). water activity (0.13; 0.30; 0.51; 0.76) or oxygen (0 [under nitrogen]; 2.5; 10 or 21% [air]).

1059210,Factors influencing micronutrient bioavailability in biofortified crops,2016,Aurélie Bechoff and Claudie Dhuique-Mayer,1390,,,74-87,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,Dietary and human factors have been found to be the major factors influencing the bioavailability of micronutrients. such as provitamin A carotenoid (pVAC). iron. and zinc. in biofortified crops. Dietary factors are related to food matrix structure and composition. Processing can improve pVAC bioavailability by disrupting the food matrix but can also result in carotenoid losses. By degrading antinutrients. such as phytate. processing can also enhance mineral bioavailability. In in vivo interventions. biofortified crops have been shown to be overall efficacious in reducing micronutrient deficiency. with bioconversion factors varying between 2.3:1 and 10.4:1 for trans-β-carotene and amounts of iron and zinc absorbed varying between 0.7 and 1.1 mg/day and 1.1 and 2.1 mg/day. respectively. Micronutrient bioavailability was dependent on the crop type and the presence of fat for pVACs and on antinutrients for minerals. In addition to dietary factors. human factors. such as inflammation and disease. can affect micronutrient status. Understanding the interactions between micronutrients is also essential. for example. the synergic effect of iron and pVACs or the competitive effect of iron and zinc.

Recently introduced biofortified yellow cassava containing provitamin A carotenoids could help tackle vitamin A deficiency prevalent in those areas. However there are concerns because of the low retention of carotenoids during gari processing compared to other processes (e.g. boiling). The aim of the study was to assess the levels of true retention in trans–β-carotene during gari processing and investigate the causes of low retention. Influence of processing step. processor (3 commercial processors) and variety (TMS 01/1371; 01/1368 and 01/1412) were assessed. It was shown that low true retention (46% on average) during gari processing may be explained by not only chemical losses (i.e. due to roasting temperature) but also by physical losses (i.e. due to leaching of carotenoids in discarded liquids): true retention in the liquid lost from grating negatively correlated with true retention retained in the mash (R = -0.914). Moreover. true retention followed the same pattern as lost water at the different processing steps (i.e. for the commercial processors). Variety had a significant influence on true retention. carotenoid content. and trans-cis isomerisation but the processor type had little effect.

Expected levels of retention at the breeding stage were verified experimentally. It was proven that the variety of biofortified crop. processing method. and micronutrient influence the level of retention. Provitamin A is best retained when the crops are boiled/steamed in water. Processing methods that are harsher on the food matrix (ie drying. frying. roasting) result in higher losses of provitamin A carotenoids. Degradation also occurs during the storage of dried products (eg from sweet potato. maize. cassava) at ambient temperature. and a short shelf life is a constraint that should be considered when foods are biofortified for provitamin A.

These deficiencies are particularly prevalent in lower-and middle-income countries (LMICs). falling disproportionately on the poorest and most vulnerable segments of the society. Dietary diversity is considered the most effective method in reducing this deficiency but is often a major constraint as most foods rich in micronutrients are also expensive and thereby inaccessible to poorer members of society. In recent years. affordable commodities such as staple foods (eg. cereals. roots. and tubers) and condiments (eg. salt and oil) have been targeted as “vehicles” for fortification and biofortification. Despite efforts by many countries to support such initiatives. there have been mixed experiences with delivery and coverage. An important but little understood driver of success and failure for food fortification has been the range of business models and approaches adopted to promote uptake. This review examines the different models used in the delivery of fortified food including complementary foods and biofortified crops.

Salmonella enterica occupies diverse anatomical sites with various concentrations of oxygen (O2) and nitric oxide (NO). These diatomic gases compete for binding to catalytic metal groups of quinol oxidases. Enterobacteriaceae express two evolutionarily distinct classes of quinol oxidases that differ in affinity for O2 and NO as well as stoichiometry of H+ translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. The investigations presented here show that the dual function of bacterial cytochrome bd in bioenergetics and antinitrosative defense enhances Salmonella virulence. The high affinity of cytochrome bd for O2 optimizes respiratory rates in hypoxic cultures. and thus. this quinol oxidase maximizes bacterial growth under O2-limiting conditions. Our investigations also indicate that cytochrome bd. rather than cytochrome bo. is an intrinsic component of the adaptive antinitrosative toolbox of …,True,pSu_LYAAAAAJ:eLRq4zTgah0C,22,https://mbio.asm.org/content/7/6/e02052-16.short,14941695763922189889,/scholar?cites=14941695763922189889,,https://mbio.asm.org/content/mbio/7/6/e02052-16.full.pdf,0,0,0

Dordrecht,Environmental pollution by discharge of dye-containing effluents represents a serious ecological problem all over the world. Public demands for colour-free discharges to receiving waters have made decoloration of a variety of industrial wastewater a top priority. The current existing chemical. physical and biological techniques used for the removal of colored pollutants have several drawbacks such as high cost. low efficiency. use of large amounts of chemicals and formation of side toxic products. It has necessitated for the search of alternative procedures such as those based on oxidative enzymes. This approach is believed to be a promising technology since it is cost-effective. environmentally friendly. highly specific and does not produce sludge.

HECT E3s use a two-step mechanism to ligate ubiquitin to target proteins. The first step is guided by interactions between the catalytic HECT domain and the E2∼ubiquitin intermediate. which promote formation of a transient. thioester-bonded HECT∼ubiquitin intermediate. Here we report that the second step of ligation is mediated by a distinct catalytic architecture established by both the HECT E3 and its covalently linked ubiquitin. The structure of a chemically trapped proxy for an E3∼ubiquitin-substrate intermediate reveals three-way interactions between ubiquitin and the bilobal HECT domain orienting the E3∼ubiquitin thioester bond for ligation. and restricting the location of the substrate-binding domain to prioritize target lysines for ubiquitination. The data allow visualization of an E2-to-E3-to-substrate ubiquitin transfer cascade. and show how HECT-specific ubiquitin interactions driving multiple reactions are repurposed by a major E3 conformational change to promote ligation.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00828.001,True,MGDpxBIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,134,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00828,4764264662766025494,/scholar?cites=4764264662766025494,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00828.pdf,0,0,0

Autoinhibition maintains these catalytic ligases in an inactive state through several mechanisms. However. although some Nedd4 family members are activated by binding to Nedd4 family-interacting proteins (Ndfips). how binding activates E3 function remains unclear. Our data reveal how these two regulatory processes are linked functionally. In the absence of Ndfip1. the Nedd4 family member Itch can bind an E2 but cannot accept ubiquitin onto its catalytic cysteine.

Their disruption is implicated in numerous neurodevelopmental. neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However. recent studies have indicated that oligodendrocytes may be tractable for treatment of disease. In recent years. zebrafish have become well established for the study of myelinating oligodendrocyte biology and drug discovery in vivo. Here. by automating the delivery of zebrafish larvae to a spinning disk confocal microscope. we were able to automate high-resolution imaging of myelinating oligodendrocytes in vivo. From there. we developed an image analysis pipeline that facilitated a screen of compounds with epigenetic and post-translational targets for their effects on regulating myelinating oligodendrocyte number. This screen identified novel compounds that strongly promote myelinating oligodendrocyte formation in vivo. Our imaging platform and analysis pipeline is flexible and can be employed for high-resolution imaging-based screens of broad interest using zebrafish.,True,MGDpxBIAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC,34,https://elifesciences.org/articles/35136,17565177887121705938,/scholar?cites=17565177887121705938,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/35136.pdf,0,0,0

Crystallographic and biochemical evidence indicate that substantial conformational change (i.e.. folding) in the catalytic domain of the protein is required for substrate recognition and catalysis. We have examined the solution conformation of the catalytic domain (C170) in the absence and presence of a cognate “half‐site” DNA oligonucleotide by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. and circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy.

A helical bundle domain in the enzyme. called the core-binding domain (IntCB). promotes the catalysis of an intermediate DNA-cleavage reaction that is critical for recombination and is not well folded in solution in the absence of DNA. To gain structural insights into the mechanism behind the accessory role of this domain in catalysis. an attempt was made to crystallize an IntCB–DNA complex. but crystals of free IntCB were fortuitously obtained. The three-dimensional structure of DNA-free IntCB was solved at 2.0 Å resolution by molecular replacement using as the search model the previously available DNA-bound 2.8 Å structure of the IntCB domain in a larger construct of lambda integrase.

The core-binding and catalytic domains of λ-Int constitute a bipartite enzyme that mediates site-specific DNA cleavage through their interactions with opposite sides of the recognition sequence. Despite minimal direct contact between the domains. the core-binding domain has been shown to facilitate site-specific DNA cleavage when provided in trans. indicating that it plays a role beyond enhancing binding affinity. Biophysical characterization of the core-binding domain and its interactions with DNA reveal that the domain is poorly structured in its free form and folds upon binding to DNA.

We report that the core-binding domain of λ-integrase is able to stimulate the activity of the catalytic domain even when the two domains are not linked. This trans stimulation is accomplished without significantly increasing the affinity of the catalytic domain for its DNA substrate. Moreover. we show that mutations in the DNA substrate can abrogate this effect while retaining specificity determinants for cleavage.

This pain is sensitive to opioids and NSAIDs. In neuropathic pain. however. damage to the nerve along the pain pathway results in spontaneous generation of action potential and lowered nociceptive threshold. as seen in allodynia and hyperalgesia. This abnormal pain transmission had been linked to LPA production in the spinal cord. through activation of NMDA and NK1 activation by glutamate and SP in iPLA2/cPLA2/ATX-dependent pathway.

Nefiracetam reportedly boosts NMDA receptor functions as a basis for its nootropic properties. Previous studies suggest that nefiracetam potentiates the NMDA receptor activation. as a more potent co-agonist for glycine binding site than glycine. though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.

Few farm people look upon their livestock as a source of danger. However. a number of serious injuries and deaths occur every year as a result of animal-related accidents. Livestock handlers are involved in a variety of activities such as feeding. moving animals to different locations. loading animals on trucks/trailers. artificial insemination. shearing. grooming. basic animal care such as hoof care. dehorning. and cleaning animals. roping animals. applying topical insecticides. giving vaccinations. applying topical or administering oral medications. castrating. pulling teeth. ear tagging. milking. branding. shoeing. assisting with delivery of newborns. and assisting veterinarians with treatment or handling of injured animals.

CB2. The therapeutic effects of cannabis is known from far away times. At the present time. some drugs containing kannabinoid are used for medical purposes. Synthetic cannabinoids’ chemical structure is quite different than natural cannabis. Cannabinoid receptor affinity and activity are greater than the natural cannabis. Substances containing synthetic cannabinoids are generally called “Spice”.“K2” abroad and.“Bonzai” or “Jamaica” in Turkey. Legal sale of herbal mixtures containing synthetic cannabinoids at places called “head shop” and “smart shop” in some countries and having easily access to them from the internet is an attractive feature for users. Moreover the impact stronger than cannabis. affordability. easy accessibility and getting rid of standard material tests contribute to increasing use of synthetic cannabinoids. As there is absence of reference standards of synthetic cannabinoids. it is not easy to identify them. In order to overcome legal barriers. new cannabinomimetic analogs are presented to market constantly. When taking into consideration of the increase of the use of synthetic cannabinoids. it is expected to be one of the most problematic drugs in the near future.

Prior to starting this prospective study. forms were prepared to collect data on pulmonary lobes and fissures. In this study. 420 lungs of 210 autopsy cases were examined for incompleteness and absence of MF and complete accessory fissures. Horizontal fissures were incomplete in 18 right lungs. Incomplete oblique fissures were noted in three right and two left lungs. Unidentified abnormal fissures were determined in one left lung and five right lungs. The most common fissural abnormality was less than half complete horizontal fissure. Four right lungs had four lobes and two left lungs had three lobes because of complete accessory fissures. The number of lobes in the left and right lungs and the morphological features of both incomplete MF and MAF were determined in detail and the variations were photographed.

To date. only Schizosaccharomyces pombe Hmt1 has been described as a phytochelatin transporter and attempts to identify orthologous phytochelatin transporters in plants and other organisms have failed. Furthermore. recent data indicate that the hmt1 mutant accumulates significant phytochelatin levels in vacuoles. suggesting that unidentified phytochelatin transporters exist in fungi.

However. alkaline soils. which occupy approximately 30% of the world’s arable lands. are considered Fe-limiting for plant growth because insoluble Fe (III) chelates prevail under these conditions. In contrast. high bioavailability of Fe in acidic soils can be toxic to plants due to the ability of Fe ions to promote oxidative stress. Therefore. plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense and respond to the fluctuation of Fe availability in the immediate environment and to the needs of developing shoot tissues to preclude deficiency while avoiding toxicity.

Phytoremediation uses plants to mitigate these types of environmental problems. and provides a cost-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to existing remediation solutions.

As one of the most important heavy metal detoxification mechanisms. the phytochelatin dependent pathway plays an essential role in detoxification and sequestration of heavy metals in plants. fungi and some nematodes. While the mechanism of phytochelatin biosynthesis has been well established. proteins mediating transport of phytochelatins and/or heavy metal phytochelatin complexes have eluded definition.

This situation most likely leads to health problems such as food poisoning. cholera and dysentery as the houseflies can transmit these diseases by acting as carriers of pathogens. Killing the houseflies at larval stage is the most effective way to prevent the problems from spreading. Extracts from certain plant parts were found to have larvicidal properties. It is also a pollutionfree and environmentally safe method. On this basis. we aimed to investigate whether Lantanacamara leaf extract is applicable to the housefly larvae in a similar manner. Lantana camara is an evergreen shrub with characteristic odour which is found growing widely all over Malaysia. Methanol extract ofLantana camara leaves was tested using direct contact method on the housefly larvae to determine the mortality rate of the larvae. Our study showed that Lantana camara extract of concentration 0.04 g/ml exerted the highest larvicidal activity towards the housefly larvae. The outcome of this investigation indicates that the beneficial effect of the plant towards the control of housefly borne diseases can be utilised if studied in further detail to create a healthy environment for society.,True,aQHIb6QAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C,1,https://www.ukm.my/geniuspintar/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PAPERS-FSC-Final.pdf,13319008981554284470,/scholar?cites=13319008981554284470,,https://www.ukm.my/geniuspintar/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PAPERS-FSC-Final.pdf,0,0,0

Translation and energy metabolism are dysregulated in a variety of diseases including cancer. diabetes. and heart disease. However. the mechanisms that coordinate translation and energy metabolism in mammals remain largely unknown. The mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) stimulates mRNA translation and other anabolic processes. We demonstrate that mTORC1 controls mitochondrial activity and biogenesis by selectively promoting translation of nucleus-encoded mitochondria-related mRNAs via inhibition of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BPs).

We further demonstrated that the kinase domain. but not the kinase function. of S6K1 was required for the S6K1-STING interaction and that the TBK1 critically promoted this process. The formation of a tripartite S6K1-STING-TBK1 complex was necessary for the activation of IRF3. and disruption of this signaling axis impaired the early-phase expression of IRF3 target genes and the induction of T cell responses and mucosal antiviral immunity.

1059586,Exploring the effects and effectors of mTOR inhibition in oncolysis and TOP mRNA translation,2018,Chadi Zakaria,,,,,,Translation is a fundamental. energy-consuming. process that permits quick and accurate responses to cellular and environmental conditions. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) acts as a central hub relaying signals to the translation machinery. which results in the modulation of various stages of mRNA translation. mTORC1 pathway is dysregulated in many human malignancies. As such. small molecule mTOR inhibitors are being investigated for cancer treatment either alone or in combination with other anti-cancer therapies.

1059587,The in vivo characterization of the DNA repair gene apn-1 in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans,2010,Chadi Zakaria,,,,,,Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are a form of highly mutagenic DNA damage that arise either spontaneously or by a variety of DNA damaging agents. To preserve genomic stability two AP endonuclease families. endo-IV and exo-III. evolved to counteract the mutagenic effect of AP sites. While members of both families were identified in multiple unicellular organisms. notably E. coli and S. cerevisiae. no members of the endo-IV family were identified in multicellular ones. with the exception of C. elegans and its close relatives. particularly C. briggsae. We set out to investigate the biological importance of APN-1 in C. elegans using gene knockdown approach. In our study. we showed that the knockdown of C. elegans apn-1 gene. using RNAi causes the accumulation of spontaneous and drug induced mutations. resulting in a delay in egg hatching. decreased survival and longevity. Furthermore. we have showed that the accumulated mutations lead to delays in cell cycle progression during early embryogenesis. thus providing a possible explanation for the observed delay in hatching. Although we showed increased mutations in the gut of the worm. we were unable to confirm APN-1 distribution tagged with GFP. The transgenic APN-1-GFP animal did not express enough of this fusion protein to be visualized by fluorescent microscopy. although it was detected by Western blot analysis. The transgenic animals over-expressing APN-1-GFP were unstable and showed phenotypes consistent with genetic defects. In conclusion. it would seem that C. elegans has evolved to retain a balanced level of APN-1. which plays a versatile role in maintaining genetic …,True,6aLaA_0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/3599,,,,https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1866/3599/Zakaria_Chadi_2009_Memoire.pdf;sequence=2,0,0,0

The mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) stimulatesmRNAtranslation and other anabolic processes.

The guanine rich sequence. d(G4T4G4). requires monovalent cations for formation of the G-quadruplex. d(G4T4G4)2. This requirement can be satisfied by thallium (Tl+). a potassium (K+) surrogate. To verify that the structure of d(G4T4G4)2 in the presence of Tl+ is similar to the K+-form of the G-quadruplex. the solution structure of the Tl+-form of d(G4T4G4)2 was determined. The 10 lowest energy structures have an all atom RMSD of 0.76 ± 0.16 Å. Comparison of this structure to the identical G-quadruplex formed in the presence of K+ validates the isomorphous nature of Tl+ and K+.

Despite their importance. few techniques exist for the direct. solution study of these cations. Toward this goal. I have used 205Tl+. a K+ surrogate which is readily detectable by solution NMR. to study the binding of monovalent canons to a G-quadruplex. d (G4T4G4) 2. The NMR and crystal structures of the Tl+-form of d (G4T4G4) 2. have been determined to assess the ability of Tl+ to mimic K+ in a nucleic acid setting. Direct detection 205Tl NMR studies have been used to characterize the binding of 205Tl+ to d (G4T4G4) 2 and provide evidence for a previously undetected mode of monovalent binding. I have also developed a 1H-205Il spin-echo difference experiment which was used to detect 1H-205Il scalar couplings and assign two of the experimentally observed 205Tl resonances to monovalent binding sites in d (G4T4G4) 2. These results comprise the first 1H-205Il scalar couplings observed in a biological system and the first 205 Tl heteronuclear experiment reported.

1059635,TLR2 and TLR4 mediated host immune responses in major infectious diseases: a review,2016,Suprabhat Mukherjee and Subhajit Karmakar and Santi Prasad Sinha Babu,20,,2,193-204,Elsevier,During the course of evolution. multicellular organisms have been orchestrated with an efficient and versatile immune system to counteract diverse group of pathogenic organisms. Pathogen recognition is considered as the most critical step behind eliciting adequate immune response during an infection. Hitherto Toll-like receptors (TLRs). especially the surface ones viz. TLR2 and TLR4 have gained immense importance due to their extreme ability of identifying distinct molecular patterns from invading pathogens. These pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) not only act as innate sensor but also shape and bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition. they also play a pivotal role in regulating the balance between Th1 and Th2 type of response essential for the survivability of the host.

The present study enumerates the ameliorating effect of ginger extract (GE) against phosphamidon (PHO. an organophosphorus insecticide) induced hepatotoxicity. GE was prepared from dried ginger and characterized for compound profile and antioxidant activity. Eight groups of albino rats (n=6) were treated with 1/5th lethal dose of PHO for 5-20 days. Out of the treated 8 groups. 4 were simultaneously fed with GE (1 mg/kg body wt.) along with PHO. Alterations in the levels of hepatocellular oxidative stress (OS) markers in the treated groups indicated an enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (OS). Upregulation of apoptotic markers. DNA fragmentation and appearance of apoptotic nuclei suggested induction of apoptosis in the liver cell that was found to be attenuated after GE treatment. Moreover. no toxicity and mortality was observed up to 100 mg/kg dose of GE for 30 days in the rat model studied. Thus.

Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to design experiments and study the effect of six influential extraction parameters: extraction buffer concentration (100-500 mM). pH of extraction buffer (4.5-8.5). time (1-12 hours). temperature (4-40 C). concentration of PMSF (1-5 mM) and volume of extraction buffer (200-1000 ml) on the extraction of PPO. The dependent variable was considered as response function which was specific activity (SA) of extracted PPO. ANOVA was performed to obtain the regression equation that could predict the responses within given range. From RSM generated model. the optimum conditions for the maximum extraction of PPO were phosphate buffer concentration of 100 mm. buffer pH of 4.5. extraction time of 1 hour. 40 C temperature. PMSF concentration of 5 mM and buffer volume of 200 ml.

The resulting pAE plasmid combined the advantages of both vectors: small size (pRSET). expression of a short 6XHis tag at N-terminus (pET3-His) and a high copy number of plasmid (pRSET). The small size of the vector (2.8 kb) and the high copy number/cell (200-250 copies) facilitate the subcloning and sequencing procedures when compared to the pET system (pET3-His. 4.6 kb and 40-50 copies) and also result in high level expression of recombinant proteins (20 mg purified protein/liter of culture). In addition. the vector pAE enables the expression of a fusion protein with a minimal amino-terminal hexa-histidine affinity tag (a tag of 9 amino acids using XhoI restriction enzyme for the 5'cloning site) as in the case of pET3-His plasmid and in contrast to proteins expressed by pRSET plasmids (a tag of 36 amino acids using BamHI restriction enzyme for the 5'cloning site).

1059708,Identification of archaeal proteins that affect the exosome function in vitro,2010,Juliana S Luz and Celso RR Ramos and Márcia CT Santos and Patricia P Coltri and Fernando L Palhano and Debora Foguel and Nilson IT Zanchin and Carla C Oliveira,11,BMC biochemistry,1,1-14,BioMed Central,The archaeal exosome is formed by a hexameric RNase PH ring and three RNA binding subunits and has been shown to bind and degrade RNA in vitro. Despite extensive studies on the eukaryotic exosome and on the proteins interacting with this complex. little information is yet available on the identification and function of archaeal exosome regulatory factors. Here. we show that the proteins PaSBDS and PaNip7. which bind preferentially to poly-A and AU-rich RNAs. respectively. affect the Pyrococcus abyssi exosome activity in vitro. PaSBDS inhibits slightly degradation of a poly-rA substrate. while PaNip7 strongly inhibits the degradation of poly-A and poly-AU by the exosome. The exosome inhibition by PaNip7 appears to depend at least partially on its interaction with RNA. since mutants of PaNip7 that no longer bind RNA. inhibit the exosome less strongly. We also show that FITC-labeled PaNip7 associates with the exosome in the absence of substrate RNA. Given the high structural homology between the archaeal and eukaryotic proteins. the effect of archaeal Nip7 and SBDS on the exosome provides a model for an evolutionarily conserved exosome control mechanism.,True,ir0M1KYAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,16,https://bmcbiochem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2091-11-22,4440739986918494080,/scholar?cites=4440739986918494080,,https://bmcbiochem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2091-11-22,0,0,0

Schistosomiasis treatment relies heavily on prazinquantel. and concerns are being raised about emerging drug-resistant worms (Doenhoff et al.. 2002). Vaccine development against S. mansoni is thought to be a better way to control the disease. along with establishment of proper sewerage systems and education. While new potential vaccines will arise from genomic information (Verjovski-Almeida et al.. 2003). several vaccine candidates are under investigation. One of these is the antigen Sm14. a 14 kDa protein identified in an immunoscreening using antibodies raised against an extract from adult S. mansoni worms (Moser et al.. 1991). Sm14 belongs to the fatty acid binding protein family (FABP) and it shows 47% of sequence similarity with the human brain type FABP (PDB 1JJX). Since schistosomes cannot synthesize sterols and fatty acids ‘de novo’. they are heavily host-dependent for these molecules and Sm14 is expected to play a vital role in the uptake. transport and compartmentalization of host-derived fatty acids. Sm14 was shown to reduce the worm burden of vaccinated mice challenged with cercariae larvae of S. mansoni and to protect against the meta-cercariae challenge of Fasciola hepatica. thus indeed resulting in a potential candidate for an anti-helminth vaccine (Almeida et al.. 2003).

The high cost of petroleum towards the end of the twentieth century stimulated the development of new fermentation technologies for producing economically viable bioethanol from sugarcane as an alternative to importing petroleum. More recently. awareness of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions due to the global climate changes propelled bioethanol as a viable renewable fuel. Consequently. sugarcane gained importance as a bioenergy feedstock. However. the lack of knowledge about sugarcane physiology. notably on aspects of photosynthesis and source–sink relationship. has slowed the advance of this expanding bioenergy-producing system. Besides the changes in source–sink relationship. another option to increase bioethanol production even more would …,True,X9lK8wUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,115,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12155-013-9366-8,15068536674678833883,/scholar?cites=15068536674678833883,,,0,0,0

Consequentemente haverá uma elevação da temperatura de até+ 3 C. o que ocorrerá em conjunto com mudanças no padrão de precipitação. O mesmo relatório sugere que isto poderá acarretar uma substituição gradual da floresta tropical por vegetação similar a uma savana na parte oriental da Amazônia. porém nada é conclusivo. Diante dessas possibilidades. pergunta-se-Como as espécies de árvores que compõem as regiões de alagamento da Amazônia irão responder às alterações climáticas por vir?

Os principais efeitos sobre a sinalização metabólica e hormonal durante o alagamento são revisados e os possíveis efeitos que as mudanças climáticas poderão ter sobre as plantas amazônicas são discutidos. As informações existentes sugerem que sob alagamento. as plantas tendem a mobilizar reservas para suprir a demanda de carbono necessário para a manutenção do metabolismo sob o estresse da falta de oxigênio.

These polymers are the targets of bioenergy research because their hydrolysis is needed to release free sugars to produce bioethanol. We already know what covalent crosslinks are within polysaccharides of the walls of key bioenergy grasses (e.g.. sugarcane. maize. and miscanthus). so that we can choose most of the enzymes necessary to break them. However. besides covalent linkages. the way these polymers are assembled through weak linkages in plant cell walls holds another important barrier for production of bioethanol.

Root aerenchyma formation results from the opening of gas spaces in the cortex. It is part of a developmental program (constitutive) or due to ethylene treatment or abiotic stress (induced) such as flooding and nutrient starvation. This process relies on programmed cell death and cell wall modifications. Here we followed development of aerenchyma formation in sugarcane along 5 cm from the root apex.

Higher levels of starch accumulation in leaves are usually correlated with a lower growth capacity. Duckweeds are fast-growing aquatic monocot plants that can accumulate high levels of starch. They are an unusual group because their cell wall has very low levels of lignin while accumulating apiogalacturonan. a pectic polysaccharide that could be involved with boron assimilation. In this work. five duckweed species from different genera (Spirodela polyrhiza. Landoltia punctata. Lemna gibba. Wolffiella caudata. and Wolffia borealis) were cultivated under two light intensities (20 and 500 µmoles of photons m-2 s-1) to evaluate the effects of growth rate on carbohydrate metabolism. A comparative analysis was performed by measuring their relative growth rates (RGR). and their content for starch. as well as soluble and cell wall carbohydrates. We found that the faster-growing species (the Lemnoideae) accumulate lower starch and higher soluble sugars than the slower-growing species within the Wolffioideae. Interestingly. analysis of the cell wall monosaccharides revealed that the slower-growing species displayed lower content of apiose in their walls. Our results indicate that higher accumulation of apiose observed in cell walls of the Lemnoideae species. which likely correlates with a higher proportion of apiogalacturonan. may lead to higher efficiency in the assimilation of boron. This is consistent with the increased RGR observed under conditions with higher apiose in the cell wall. such as higher light intensity.

Cogniaux (Melastomataceae). Para tanto. as sementes foram submetidas à fotoperíodos de 4. 6. 8. 10 e 12 horas de luz de sombreamento. um tipo especial de luz que simula as condições encontradas em ambientes naturais. Estes fotoperíodos foram associados a temperaturas alternadas entre 20-30 C. As sementes não germinaram em fotoperíodos inferiores a 8 horas e a maior porcentagem de germinação foi observada no fotoperíodo de 12 horas. Além do efeito do fotoperíodo foi avaliado o fotoequilíbrio teórico do fitocromo que pode promover ou inibir a germinação da espécie.

Such post‐transcriptional negative regulation is relevant for both plant development and environmental adaptations. An important biotechnological application of miRNA identification is the discovery of regulators and effectors of cell wall degradation. which can improve/facilitate hydrolysis of cell wall polymers for second‐generation bioethanol production. The recent characterization of plant innate cell wall modifications occurring during root aerenchyma development triggered by ethylene led to the possibility of prospection for mechanisms of cell wall disassembly in sugarcane.

However. the complex chemical composition and physical structure of SCWs hinder efficient processing of plant biomass. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying SCW deposition is. thus. essential to optimize bioenergy feedstocks. Here. we establish a xylogenic culture as a model system to study SCW deposition in sugarcane; the first of its kind in a C4 grass species. We used auxin and brassinolide to differentiate sugarcane suspension cells into tracheary elements. which showed metaxylem-like reticulate or pitted SCW patterning. The differentiation led to increased lignin levels. mainly caused by S-lignin units. and a rise in p-coumarate. leading to increased p-coumarate:ferulate ratios. RNAseq analysis revealed massive transcriptional reprogramming during differentiation. with upregulation of genes associated with cell wall biogenesis and phenylpropanoid metabolism and downregulation of genes related to cell division and primary metabolism. To better understand the differentiation process. we constructed regulatory networks of transcription factors and SCW-related genes based on co-expression analyses. Accordingly. we found multiple regulatory modules that may underpin SCW deposition in sugarcane.

Photosystem I (PSI) is one of the two reaction centers of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria and higher plants. PSI is a multisubunit membrane bound protein complex that catalyzes the photooxidation of plastocyanin in the thylakoid lumen and the photoreduction of ferredoxin in the cytoplasm. The PsaA/PsaB subunits form the heterodimeric core that harbors the primary electron donor P700 and acceptors A0. A1. and FX. Two electron acceptors. FA and FB. occupy PsaC one of three peripheral proteins bound to PSI. The secondary electron acceptor. A1. contains a phylloquinone. a molecule utilized only in PSI. The object of this dissertation is to probe phylloquinone biosynthesis and the bioenergetic aspects of phylloquinone. plastoquinone. and other naphthoquinones in the A1 site of PSI; To investigate phylloquinone's role in PSI. we substituted alternative naphthoquinones and plastoquinone into the A1 site to observe the physiological of the cells and energetic changes in PSI.

We have identified and characterized a novel depolymerase enzyme encoded by Klebsiella phage KP36 (depoKP36). from the Siphoviridae family. To gain insights into the catalytic and structural features of depoKP36. we have recombinantly produced this protein of 93.4 kDa and showed that it is able to hydrolyze a crude exopolysaccharide of a K. pneumoniae host. Using in vitro and in vivo assays. we found that depoKP36 was also effective against a native capsule of clinical K. pneumoniae strains. representing the K63 type. and significantly inhibited Klebsiella-induced mortality of Galleria mellonella larvae in a time-dependent manner. DepoKP36 did not affect the antibiotic susceptibility of Klebsiella strains. The activity of this enzyme was retained in a broad range of pH values (4.0–7.0) and temperatures (up to 45 C). Consistently. the circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed a highly stability with melting transition temperature (T m)= 65 C. In contrast to other phage tailspike proteins. this enzyme was susceptible to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) denaturation and proteolytic cleavage.

These peptides are also toxic to the producing organisms that utilize dedicated ABC transporters to achieve self-immunity. MccJ25 is exported by the Escherichia coli ABC transporter McjD through a complex mechanism of recognition that has remained elusive. Here. we used biomolecular NMR to study this interaction and identified a region of the toxic peptide that is crucial to its recognition by the ABC transporter. Our study provides evidence that McjD is highly specific to MccJ25 and not to other RiPPs or antibiotics. unlike multidrug ABC transporters.

Although it is an important target for antimicrobial development. its mechanism of action and its interaction pattern with its substrate are hitherto unknown. By combining crystallographic and mutational studies with functional assays and molecular modelling. it is shown that the catalytic activity of the enzyme relies on a Cys–His–Glu triad and the impact of the mutation of each residue of the triad on the structure and function of RipA is analysed. Unexpectedly. the crystallographic analyses reveal that mutation of the glutamic acid to alanine results in inversion of the configuration of the catalytic cysteine.

In recent years. there has been a growing evidence that oxidative stress is an important mechanism of toxicity; however. when acellular oxidative potential (OP) data are correlated with the outcomes of in vitro (or in vivo) toxicological tests there are contrasting results. In this work. an analysis of PM 10 health effect indicators was done. using the acellular Dithiotreitol (DTT) assay to retrieve OP DTT. the Microtox® test on Vibrio fischeri bacterium to assess the ecotoxicological potential. and the in vitro MTT assay on the human cell line A549 to estimate the cytotoxicological potential. The objective was to evaluate the correlation among acellular OP DTT and the results from toxicological and ecotoxicological bioassays and how these health-related indicators are correlated with atmospheric PM 10 concentrations collected at an urban background site in Southern Italy. Results indicated that both bioassays showed time-dependent and dose-dependent outcomes. Some samples presented significant ecotoxic and cytotoxic response and the correlation with PM 10 concentration was limited suggesting that these health endpoints depend on PM 10 chemical composition and not only on exposure concentrations.

Diatoms typically inhabit rapidly changing and unstable environments. suggesting that cell cycle regulation in diatoms must have evolved to adequately integrate various environmental signals. The recent genome sequencing of Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum allows us to explore the molecular conservation of cell cycle regulation in diatoms. By profile-based annotation of cell cycle genes. counterparts of conserved as well as new regulators were identified in T. pseudonana and P. tricornutum.

Being strictly dependent on silica to build their biomineralized cell walls. marine diatoms precipitate 240× 10 12 mol Si per year. which makes them the major sink in the global Si cycle. Dissolved silicic acid (dSi) availability frequently limits diatom productivity and influences species composition of communities. We show that benthic diatoms selectively perceive and behaviourally react to gradients of dSi. Cell speed increases under dSi-limited conditions in a chemokinetic response and. if gradients of this resource are present. increased directionality of cell movement promotes chemotaxis. The ability to exploit local and short-lived dSi hotspots using a specific search behaviour likely contributes to micro-scale patch dynamics in biofilm communities.

The multilobed cell wall of Micrasterias denticulata that rebuilds symmetrically after cell division and consists of pectin and cellulose. makes this unicellular streptophyte alga an interesting model system to study the molecular controls on cell shape and cell wall formation in green plants. Genome-wide transcript expression profiling of synchronously growing cells identified 107 genes of which the expression correlated with the growth phase. Four transcripts showed high similarity to expansins that had not been examined previously in green algae. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that these genes are most closely related to the plant EXPANSIN A family. although their domain organization is very divergent. A GFP-tagged version of the expansin-resembling protein MdEXP2 localized to the cell wall and in Golgi-derived vesicles. Overexpression phenotypes ranged from lobe elongation to loss of growth polarity and planarity. These results indicate that MdEXP2 can alter the cell wall structure and. thus. might have a function related to that of land plant expansins during cell morphogenesis.

Some members of the genus Bifidobacterium. common infant gut commensals. are known to consume 2′-fucosylated glycans found in the breast milk of secretor mothers. We investigated the effects of maternal secretor status on the developing infant microbiota with a special emphasis on bifidobacterial species abundance. On average. bifidobacteria were established earlier and more often in infants fed by secretor mothers than in infants fed by non-secretor mothers. In secretor-fed infants. the relative abundance of the Bifidobacterium longum group was most strongly correlated with high percentages of the order Bifidobacteriales. Conversely. in non-secretor-fed infants. Bifidobacterium breve was positively correlated with Bifidobacteriales. while the B. longum group was negatively correlated. A higher percentage of bifidobacteria isolated from secretor-fed infants consumed 2′-fucosyllactose. Infant feces with high levels of bifidobacteria had lower milk oligosaccharide levels in the feces and higher amounts of lactate. Furthermore. feces containing different bifidobacterial species possessed differing amounts of oligosaccharides. suggesting differential consumption in situ. Infants fed by non-secretor mothers are delayed in the establishment of a bifidobacteria-laden microbiota. This delay may be due to difficulties in the infant acquiring a species of bifidobacteria able to consume the specific milk oligosaccharides delivered by the mother.

Although it is a highly glycosylated protein. its site-specific glycosylation and associated glycan micro-heterogeneity have still not been fully elucidated. In this study. the site-specific glycosylation of sIgA isolated from human colostrum (n = 3) was analyzed using a combination of LC–MS and LC–MS/MS and in-house software (Glycopeptide Finder). The majority of the glycans found are biantennary structures with one or more acidic Neu5Ac residues; however. a large fraction belonged to truncated complex structures with terminal GlcNAc.

Many studies had evaluated the effects of temperature on aquatic ecosystems. but now the field broadens as the combination and variations of temperature and radiation gains especial importance. In this work we attempt to revisit some of our knowledge about the effects of UVR and temperature on marine and freshwater plankton and fish from temperate regions (defined here as latitudes between 30-60º). especially from the Patagonia area. due to the special characteristics found in these sites. UVR affects (often negatively) almost all processes. from carbon fixation to behavior; and certainly all trophic levels in plankton. from virus to fish larvae.

DPCs represent physical obstacles to the progression of DNA replication. If not repaired. DPCs cause stalling of DNA replication forks that consequently leads to DNA double-strand breaks. the most cytotoxic DNA lesion. Although DPCs are common DNA lesions. the mechanism of DPC repair was unclear until now. Recent work unveiled that DPC repair is orchestrated by proteolysis performed by two distinct metalloproteases. SPARTAN in metazoans and Wss1 in yeast.

1060208,DNA protein crosslink proteolysis repair: From yeast to premature ageing and cancer in humans,2018,John Fielden and Annamaria Ruggiano and Marta Popović and Kristijan Ramadan,71,,,198-204,Elsevier,DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are a specific type of DNA lesion consisting of a protein covalently and irreversibly bound to DNA. which arise after exposure to physical and chemical crosslinking agents. DPCs can be bulky and thereby pose a barrier to DNA replication and transcription. The persistence of DPCs during S phase causes DNA replication stress and genome instability. The toxicity of DPCs is exploited in cancer therapy: many common chemotherapeutics kill cancer cells by inducing DPC formation.Recent work from several laboratories discovered a specialized repair pathway for DPCs. namely DPC proteolysis (DPCP) repair. DPCP repair is carried out by replication-coupled DNA-dependent metalloproteases: Wss1 in yeast and SPRTN in metazoans. Mutations in SPRTN cause premature ageing and liver cancer in humans and mice; thus. defective DPC repair has great clinical ramifications.

Due to the lack of knowledge on zebrafish Slc22 family. we performed initial characterization of these transporters using a detailed phylogenetic and conserved synteny analysis followed by the tissue specific expression profiling of slc22 transcripts. We identified 20 zebrafish slc22 genes which are organized in the same functional subgroups as human SLC22 members. Orthologies and syntenic relations between zebrafish and other vertebrates revealed consequences of the teleost-specific whole genome duplication as shown through one-to-many orthologies for certain zebrafish slc22 genes. Tissue expression profiles of slc22 transcripts were analyzed using qRT-PCR determinations in nine zebrafish tissues: liver. kidney. intestine. gills. brain. skeletal muscle. eye. heart. and gonads.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of RA on the phenotype of corneal stromal keratocytes maintained in vitro for extended periods under serum-free conditions.Methods.: Keratocytes isolated from human corneas were cultured up to 21 days in serum-free media supplemented with RA or DMSO vehicle. The effects of RA and of its removal after treatment on cell proliferation and morphology were evaluated. In addition. the expression of keratocyte markers was quantified at the transcriptional and protein levels by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting or ELISA. respectively. Furthermore. the effects of RA on keratocyte migration were tested using scratch assays.Results.: Keratocytes cultured with RA up to 10× 10− 6 M showed enhanced proliferation and stratification. and reduced mobility. RA also promoted the expression of keratocyte-characteristic proteoglycans. such as keratocan. lumican. and decorin. and increased the amounts of collagen type-I in culture while significantly reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteases 1. 3. and 9. RA effects were reversible. and cell phenotype reverted to that of control after removal of RA from media.Conclusions.: Retinoic acid was shown to control the phenotype of human corneal keratocytes cultured in vitro by regulating cell behavior and extracellular matrix composition.

This has been particularly evident in the development of new approaches applied to reconstruct corneal tissue. The need for tissue-engineered corneas is largely a response to the shortage of donor tissue and the lack of suitable alternative biological scaffolds preventing the treatment of millions of blind people worldwide. This review is focused on recent developments in corneal tissue engineering. specifically on the use of self-assembling peptide amphiphiles for this purpose. Recently. peptide amphiphiles have generated great interest as therapeutic molecules. both in vitro and in vivo. Here we introduce this rapidly developing field. and examine innovative applications of peptide amphiphiles to create natural bio-prosthetic corneal tissue in vitro. The advantages of peptide amphiphiles over other biomaterials. namely their wide range of functions and applications. versatility. and transferability are also discussed to better understand how these fascinating molecules can help solve current challenges in corneal regeneration.

However. the signaling pathways underlying this dependency are still poorly understood. To address this issue. we investigated the effect of substrate stiffness on the migration. proliferation. and molecular phenotype of human limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs). Specifically. we demonstrated that cells grown on collagen-based substrates with limbus-like compliance showed higher proliferation and stratification and lower migration capabilities. as well as higher levels of pro-proliferative markers Ki67 and β-Catenin. and LESC markers ΔNp63. ABCG2. and CK15. In contrast. cells on stiffer substrates lost these stem/progenitor cell markers. but instead expressed the key mechanotransduction factor YAP. as well as elevated levels of BMP4. a promotor of cell differentiation known to be negatively regulated by Wnt/β-Catenin signaling. This data allowed us to propose a new model that integrates the various molecular pathways involved in LESC response to substrate stiffness.

In these enzymes. molybdenum catalyzes oxygen transfer reactions from or to substrates using water as oxygen donor or acceptor. Molybdenum shuttles between two oxidation states. MoIV and MoVI. Following substrate reduction or oxidation. electrons are subsequently shuttled by either inter- or intra-molecular electron transfer chains involving prosthetic groups such as heme or iron-sulfur clusters.

While the etiology of preeclampsia is unclear. human and animal studies suggest that excessive circulating levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine-kinase-1 (sFlt-1). an alternatively spliced variant of VEGF-receptor1. contribute to the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. Since sFlt-1 binds to heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. we hypothesized that the anticoagulant heparin. which is often used in pregnancy. may interfere with the levels. distribution and elimination of sFlt-1 in vivo.  Objective We systematically determined serum and urine levels of angiogenic factors in preeclamptic women before and after administration of low molecular weight heparin and further characterized the interaction with heparin in biochemical studies.  Methods and Results Serum and urine samples were used to measure sFlt-1 levels before and after heparin administration. Serum levels of sFlt-1 increased by 25% after heparin administration in pregnant women. The magnitude of the increase in circulating sFlt-1 correlated with initial sFlt-1 serum levels. Urinary sFlt-1 levels were also elevated following heparin administration and levels of elimination were dependent on the underlying integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. Biochemical binding studies employing cation exchange chromatography revealed that heparin bound sFlt-1 had decreased affinity to negatively charged surfaces when compared to sFlt-1 alone.  Conclusion Low molecular weight heparin administration increased circulating sFlt1 levels and enhanced renal …,True,uDWyK9oAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,40,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085258,8336980260935032221,/scholar?cites=8336980260935032221,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085258,0,0,0

1060316,Cellular senescence and iron dyshomeostasis in Alzheimer’s disease,2019,Shashank Masaldan and Abdel Ali Belaidi and Scott Ayton and Ashley I Bush,12,,2,93,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Iron dyshomeostasis is a feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The impact of iron on AD is attributed to its interactions with the central proteins of AD pathology (amyloid precursor protein and tau) and/or through the iron-mediated generation of prooxidant molecules (eg. hydroxyl radicals). However. the source of iron accumulation in pathologically relevant regions of the brain and its contribution to AD remains unclear. One likely contributor to iron accumulation is the age-associated increase in tissue-resident senescent cells that drive inflammation and contribute to various pathologies associated with advanced age. Iron accumulation predisposes ageing tissue to oxidative stress that can lead to cellular dysfunction and to iron-dependent cell death modalities (eg. ferroptosis). Further. elevated brain iron is associated with the progression of AD and cognitive decline. Elevated brain iron presents a feature of AD that may be modified pharmacologically to mitigate the effects of age/senescence-associated iron dyshomeostasis and improve disease outcome.

To further investigate their involvement in the etiology of PD. we conducted miRNA expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 19 patients and 13 controls using microarrays. We found 18 miRNAs differentially expressed. and pathway analysis of 662 predicted target genes of 11 of these miRNAs revealed an over-representation in pathways previously linked to PD as well as novel pathways. To narrow down the genes for further investigations. we undertook a parallel approach using chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis to uncover genome-wide interactions of α-synuclein. a molecule with a central role in both monogenic and idiopathic PD. Convergence of ChIP-seq and miRNomics data highlighted the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and the ubiquitin proteasome system as key players in PD. We then tested the association of target genes belonging to these pathways with PD risk. and identified nine SNPs in USP37 consistently associated with PD susceptibility in three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets (0.46≤OR≤0.63) and highly significant in the meta-dataset (3.36×10−4<p<1.94×10−3). A SNP in ST8SIA4 was also highly associated with PD (p = 6.15×10−3) in the meta-dataset.

1060347,Translation in amino-acid-poor environments is limited by tRNAGln charging,2020,Natalya N Pavlova and Bryan King and Rachel H Josselsohn and Sara Violante and Victoria L Macera and Santosha A Vardhana and Justin R Cross and Craig B Thompson,9,Elife,,e62307,eLife Sciences Publications Limited,An inadequate supply of amino acids leads to accumulation of uncharged tRNAs. which can bind and activate GCN2 kinase to reduce translation. Here. we show that glutamine-specific tRNAs selectively become uncharged when extracellular amino acid availability is compromised. In contrast. all other tRNAs retain charging of their cognate amino acids in a manner that is dependent upon intact lysosomal function. In addition to GCN2 activation and reduced total translation. the reduced charging of tRNAGln in amino-acid-deprived cells also leads to specific depletion of proteins containing polyglutamine tracts including core-binding factor α1. mediator subunit 12. transcriptional coactivator CBP and TATA-box binding protein. Treating amino-acid-deprived cells with exogenous glutamine or glutaminase inhibitors restores tRNAGln charging and the levels of polyglutamine-containing proteins. Together. these results demonstrate that the activation of GCN2 and the translation of polyglutamine-encoding transcripts serve as key sensors of glutamine availability in mammalian cells.,True,XkpYyooAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,0,https://elifesciences.org/articles/62307,,,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/62307.pdf,0,0,0
1060349,Stable Isotope Tracers for Metabolic Pathway Analysis,2019,Sara Violante and Mirela Berisa and Tiffany H Thomas and Justin R Cross,,,,269-283,Humana. New York. NY,Stable isotope tracing allows a metabolic substrate to be followed through downstream biochemical reactions. thereby providing unparalleled insights into the metabolic wiring of cells. This approach stops short of modeling absolute fluxes but is relatively straightforward and has become increasingly accessible due to the widespread adoption of high-resolution mass spectrometers. Analysis of both dynamic and steady-state labeling patterns in downstream metabolites provides valuable qualitative information as to their origin and relative rates of production. Stable isotope tracing is. therefore. a powerful way to understand the impact of genetic alterations and defined perturbations on metabolism. In this chapter. we describe a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) protocol for stable isotope tracing using 13C-l-arginine in a macrophage cell line. A similar approach can be used to follow other stable …,True,XkpYyooAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,0,https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9236-2_17,,,,,0,0,0

The authors identified exported proteins from C. difficile strain VPI 10463 during conditions promoting high toxin production. Toxins A and B were released in a 1:1 ratio and the proportion of toxin in the extracellular fraction reached 50% during the stationary phase as compared to a proportion of <1% for typical cytoplasmic proteins. showing that toxin export was not due to bacterial lysis. A 47 kDa protein. released with similar kinetics to the toxins. was processed and showed weak similarity to the channel-forming protein TolC.

In contrast to other hematophagous insects. the triatomine gut is compartmentalized into three segments that perform different functions during blood digestion. Here we report analysis of transcriptomes for each of the segments using pyrosequencing technology. Comparison of transcript frequency in digestive libraries with a whole-body library was used to evaluate expression levels. All classes of digestive enzymes were highly expressed. with a predominance of cysteine and aspartic proteinases. the latter showing a significant expansion through gene duplication. Although no protein digestion is known to occur in the anterior midgut (AM). protease transcripts were found. suggesting secretion as pro-enzymes. being possibly activated in the posterior midgut (PM). As expected. genes related to cytoskeleton. protein synthesis apparatus. protein traffic. and secretion were abundantly transcribed. Despite the absence of a chitinous peritrophic membrane in hemipterans - which have instead a lipidic perimicrovillar membrane lining over midgut epithelia - several gut-specific peritrophin transcripts were found. suggesting that these proteins perform functions other than being a structural component of the peritrophic membrane.

Several studies have shown that sharply bent optical fiber will fail prematurely when exposed to high optical power levels. In an extreme case. where the fiber is bent to a maximum bend stress on the order of 2 GPa and subjected to a power level of 1–2 W in the near‐infrared wavelength window. optical fiber will fail in minutes. Time to failure decreases with increasing bend stress and optical power. A recent report suggests that power levels in the range of a few hundred milliwatts may be enough to induce delayed failure in bent fiber. This study explores the progression of events leading to failure. Light that escapes the core of bent fiber passes into the coating. where a small amount is absorbed and converted to heat.

This concentration dependence is consistent with a mechanism in which electron transfer to the heme takes place at two independent sites where reductants appear to bind. We propose that the low-affinity site is located close to the heme edge. within the heme pocket; the maximum rate of electron transfer is highly variable depending on the nature of the reductant (0.005 to > 10 s− 1). The other site has higher apparent affinity (KD 0.2–50 μM) but a low maximum rate of electron transfer (0.005 to 0.01 s− 1).

One common molecular feature of most of the α-DG ligands is the presence of laminin globular (LG) domains that are likely to interact with some of the carbohydrates protruding from the mucin-like region of α-DG. Every tissue is supposed to produce a specific α-DG harboring a particular sugar moiety that will enable it to bind a specific ligand. but often several α-DG ligands are co-expressed within the same tissue.

The knowledge collected on the subdomain organization of the two subunits of the adhesion complex dystroglycan (DG) enabled us to insert the 10 amino acids myc-tag at different locations along the α-subunit. in order to better visualize and investigate the DG complex in eukaryotic cells. We have generated two forms of DG polypeptides via the insertion of the myc-tag 1) within a flexible loop (between a.a. 170 and 171) that separates two autonomous subdomains. and 2) within the C-terminal domain in position 500. Their analysis showed that double-tagging (the β-subunit is linked to GFP) does not significantly interfere with the correct processing of the DG precursor (pre-DG) and confirmed that the α-DG N-terminal domain is processed in the cell before α-DG reaches its plasma membrane localization. In addition. myc insertion in position 500. right before the second Ig-like domain of α-DG. proved to be an efficient tool for the detection and pulling-down of glycosylated α-DG molecules targeted at the membrane. Further characterization of these and other myc-permissive site(s) will represent a valid support for the study of the maturation process of pre-DG and could result in the creation of a new class of intrinsic doubly-fluorescent DG molecules that would allow the monitoring of the two DG subunits. or of pre-DG. in cells without the need of antibodies.,True,oweVR3wAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,18,https://bmcbiochem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2091-13-14,15883661998458854503,/scholar?cites=15883661998458854503,,https://bmcbiochem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2091-13-14,0,0,0

Functional expression analysis in vitro and in vivo indicated that the mutation was responsible for a decrease in posttranslational glycosylation of dystroglycan. eventually interfering with its extracellular-matrix receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain. The X-ray crystal structure of the missense variant T190M of the murine N-terminal domain of α-dystroglycan (50-313) has been determined. and showed an overall topology (Ig-like domain followed by a basket-shaped domain reminiscent of the small subunit ribosomal protein S6) very similar to that of the wild-type structure. The crystallographic analysis revealed a change of the conformation assumed by the highly flexible loop encompassing residues 159–180. Moreover. a solvent shell reorganization around Met190 affects the interaction between the B1–B5 anti-parallel strands forming part of the floor of the basket-shaped domain. with likely repercussions on the folding stability of the protein domain(s) and on the overall molecular flexibility. Chemical denaturation and limited proteolysis experiments point to a decreased stability of the T190M variant with respect to its wild-type counterpart. This mutation may render the entire L-shaped protein architecture less flexible. The overall reduced flexibility and stability may affect the functional properties of α-dystroglycan via negatively influencing its binding behavior to factors needed for dystroglycan maturation. and may lay the molecular basis of …,True,oweVR3wAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,11,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124277,12058932633655726476,/scholar?cites=12058932633655726476,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124277,0,0,0

1060591,Genetic engineering of dystroglycan in animal models of muscular dystrophy,2015,Francesca Sciandra and Maria Giulia Bigotti and Bruno Giardina and Manuela Bozzi and Andrea Brancaccio,2015,,,,Hindawi,In skeletal muscle. dystroglycan (DG) is the central component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). a multimeric protein complex that ensures a strong mechanical link between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. Several muscular dystrophies arise from mutations hitting most of the components of the DGC. Mutations within the DG gene (DAG1) have been recently associated with two forms of muscular dystrophy. one displaying a milder and one a more severe phenotype. This review focuses specifically on the animal (murine and others) model systems that have been developed with the aim of directly engineering DAG1 in order to study the DG function in skeletal muscle as well as in other tissues. In the last years. conditional animal models overcoming the embryonic lethality of the DG knock-out in mouse have been generated and helped clarifying the crucial role of DG in skeletal muscle. while an increasing number of studies on knock-in mice are aimed at understanding the contribution of single amino acids to the stability of DG and to the possible development of muscular dystrophy.,True,oweVR3wAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,9,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/635792/abs/,7442528696230660725,/scholar?cites=7442528696230660725,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/635792/abs/,0,0,0

This method is based on the cloning of a specific. short nucleotide sequence (tag) in the phagemid coding for each phage-displayed antibody fragment (phage-Ab) present in a library. In order to set up and validate the method we identified about 10.000 different phage-Abs binding to receptors expressed in their native form on the cell surface (10 k Membranome collection) and tagged each individual phage-Ab. The frequency of each phage-Ab in a given population can at this point be inferred by measuring the frequency of its associated tag sequence through standard DNA hybridization methods. Using tiny amounts of biological samples we identified phage-Abs binding to receptors preferentially expressed on primary tumor cells rather than on cells obtained from matched normal tissues.

1060598,Analysis of α-dystroglycan/LG domain binding modes: investigating protein motifs that regulate the affinity of isolated LG domains,2019,Christopher E Dempsey and Maria Giulia Bigotti and Josephine C Adams and Andrea Brancaccio,6,,,18,Frontiers,Dystroglycan (DG) is an adhesion complex that links the cytoskeleton to the surrounding extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle and a wide variety of other tissues. It is composed of a highly glycosylated extracellular alpha-DG associated noncovalently with a transmembrane beta-DG whose cytodomain interacts with dystrophin and its isoforms. Alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) binds tightly and in a calcium-dependent fashion to multiple extracellular proteins and proteoglycans. each of which harbours at least one. or. more frequently. tandem arrays of laminin-globular (LG) domains. Considerable biochemical and structural work has accumulated on the alpha-DG-binding LG domains. highlighting a significant heterogeneity in ligand-binding properties of domains from different proteins as well as between single and multiple LG domains within the same protein. Here we review biochemical. structural and functional information on the LG domains reported to bind alpha-dystroglycan. In addition. we have incorporated bioinformatics and modelling to explore whether specific motifs responsible for alpha-dystroglycan recognition can be identified within isolated LG domains. In particular. we analysed the LG domains of slits and agrin as well as those of paradigmatic alpha-DG non-binders such as laminin-alpha3. While some stretches of basic residues may be important. no universally conserved motifs could be identified. However. the data confirm that the coordinated calcium atom within the LG domain is needed to establish an interaction with the sugars of alpha-DG. although it appears that this alone is insufficient to mediate significant alpha-DG …,True,oweVR3wAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,6,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2019.00018/full,15185821895926532998,/scholar?cites=15185821895926532998,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2019.00018/full,0,0,0

This study was performed primarily to establish experimental procedures and verify the effectiveness of the X-ray test to detect damage or abnormalities in bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) seed structure associated with germination. Five seed lots each of hybrids Reinger and Sentinel were used. Two hundred seeds per lot were exposed to durations and intensities of X-radiation and visually classified into four categories according to the proportion between the area occupied by the embryo and endosperm in relation to the total cavity area in the internal seed structure. e.g. 0. < 50%. 50-75% and 100%. The last category was subdivided into two others based on the occurrence of morphological abnormalities. Seed samples obtained from different X-ray categories were then submitted to germination test at 25ºC for 14 days and subsequently compared with results of the X-ray analysis. Exposure to a 10 kV radiation for 260 s was the most suitable X-ray dose for visualizing seed structure. Seeds in which the area of the internal cavity occupied by the embryo and endosperm varied from 50-75% produced abnormal seedlings or did not germinate. Full seeds (100% of the internal cavity area occupied) with abnormal structure usually originated defective seedlings. As a consequence. the classification of bell pepper seeds according to the proportion occupied by the seed content (embryo + endosperm) allowed a reliable estimation of the degree of seed physical integrity based on X-ray analysis and its association with germination performance.,True,cdpbI68AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,146,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-90162011000400004&script=sci_arttext,5099212975064171033,/scholar?cites=5099212975064171033,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-90162011000400004&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

Studies have shown that scorpion venom increases pro-inflammatory cytokine production. contributing to immunological imbalance. multiple organ dysfunction. and patient death. We have previously demonstrated that TsV is a venom-associated molecular pattern (VAMP) recognized by TLRs inducing intense inflammatory reaction through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators prostaglandin (PG)E2 and leukotriene (LT)B4. Lipid bodies (LBs) are potential sites for eicosanoid production by inflammatory cells.

In this study. the subtype specificity and selectivity of Ts4 was investigated using six mammalian Nav channels (Nav1. 2→ Nav1. 6 and Nav1. 8) and two insect Nav channels (DmNav1 and BgNav). The electrophysiological assays showed that Ts4 specifically inhibited the fast inactivation of Nav1. 6 channels. the most abundant sodium channel expressed in the adult central nervous system. and can no longer be classified as a “non-toxic peptide”. Based on the results. we could classify the Ts4 as a classical α-toxin. The Ts4 3D-structural model was built based on the solved X-ray Ts1 3D-structure. the major toxin from Ts venom with which it shares high sequence identity (65.57%). The Ts4 model revealed a flattened triangular shape constituted by three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and one α-helix stabilized by four disulfide bonds. The absence of a Lys in the first amino acid residue of the N-terminal of Ts4 is probably the main responsible for its low toxicity. Other key amino acid residues important to the toxicity of α-and β-toxins are discussed here.

Accordingly. immunoneutralization of glucagon or genetic deletion of the glucagon receptor improved glucose homeostasis in animal models of diabetes.

We report the discovery of mirror-image DNA-aptamers (Spiegelmer®) that bind and inhibit glucagon. The affinity of the best binding DNA oligonucleotide was remarkably increased (> 25-fold) by the introduction of oxygen atoms at selected 2′-positions through deoxyribo-to ribonucleotide exchanges resulting in a mixed DNA/RNA-Spiegelmer (NOX-G15) that binds glucagon with a K d of 3 n m.

Recently. it has been presented that obestatin may regulate adipocyte metabolism and influence fat content. However. obestatin action is still poorly understood. Therefore. we aimed to investigate obestatin function on adipocyte metabolism in the rat. We studied changes in the mRNA expression of active and inactive isoforms of obestatin receptors. In addition. we analyzed influence of obestatin on lipogenesis. lipolysis and glucose transport in isolated adipocytes. Moreover. we also performed analysis of obestatin action on lipolysis in differentiated rat preadipocytes with silenced obestatin receptor.

The synbiotics were administered via syringe. using a special automatic system. into the egg air chamber of Cobb 500 broiler chicks on the 12th day of egg incubation (2 mg of prebiotics + 105 cfu bacteria per egg). Hatched roosters (total 2.400) were reared on an experimental farm. kept in pens (75 animals per pen). with free access to feed and water. After 42 d animals were slaughtered. Blood serum. pancreas. duodenum and duodenum content were collected. Syn2 increased trypsin activity by 2.5-fold in the pancreas and 1.5-fold in the duodenal content. In the duodenum content. Syn2 resulted in ca 30% elevation in lipase activity and 70% reduction in amylase activity.

The use of oxidants in dietary food stuff may lead to the production of oxidized LDL and may increase both the development and the progression of atherosclerosis. The present work investigated the effects of some elements including: copper (Cu). iron (Fe). vanadium (V) and titanium (Ti) on in vitro LDL oxidation quantitatively.Methods: The first LDL fraction was isolated from fresh plasma by single vertical discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation. The formation of conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and increase in electrophoretic mobility of LDL were monitored as markers of the oxidation of LDL.Results: It was demonstrated that Cu. Fe. V and Ti exhibited strong oxidant activity in this respect (P< 0.001). Oxidation of LDL in the presence of Cu was more and appeared to be in this order Cu> Fe> V> Ti.Discussion: Cu. Fe. V and Ti are redox-active transition metals that may cause oxidative damage to lipids. proteins and DNA molecules.

The basis of this toxicity is believed to be the negative influence on enzymatic system of cells. In the past few years. increasing consideration has been given to interactions occurring between lead and some essential metals including Se and Zn. Based on the finding that some trace elements could reverse the toxicity of lead on tissue functions this work was performed to study the protective effects of Zn and Se against lead toxicity. Thus changes in acetyl cholinesterase (AchE) activity in brain regions were investigated in different conditions. Four groups of rats were chosen. In acute study. ip administration of Pb (13.5 mg/kg) for 2 weeks reduced the activity of AchE in the cortex by 28.7% but Pb in presence of Zn (0.5 mg/kg) and Se (0.4 mg/kg) inhibited AchE activity only by 11.5% and 25%. respectively. such inhibition in mid-brain were 44.7%. 18.2%. 32% and in the cerebellum 48.2%. 38.4% and 12.0%.

This may be due to the presence of estradiol (E2) in this area of the male but not in the female since castration of the newborn male leads to an enzyme activity in the hypothalamus that is indistinguishable from that of the female and androgenization of the newborn female causes an enzyme activity level comparable to that of the male. In the adult. enzyme activity is highest when the concentration of E2 is at its lowest level; adenylate cyclase activity in the hypothalamus-preoptic area was found to be higher in the metestrus female than in proestrus or in the adult male. In vitro E2 was shown to reduce enzyme activity and this reduction was found to be dependent on induction of protein biosynthesis.

Oxidative stress and consequent oxidized lipoprotein production is thought to play a central role in both the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)/β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) complexes are etiologically important in the development of atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether long-term treatment with conventional hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women could affect total serum antioxidant capacity (TAC) and serum levels of oxLDL/β2GPI complexes. A total of 60 normolipidemic postmenopausal women treated with oral estrogen together with progestin therapy for 3 months were selected. TAC and serum levels of oxLDL/β2GPI complexes were measured at the beginning and end of the HRT. HRT led to a significant increase in TAC (15%. P= 0.02) and a minor but statistically nonsignificant decrease of oxLDL/β2GPI complexes (3%. P= 0.30) when compared with the baseline control levels. There was also no significant association between TAC and oxLDL/β2GPI complexes changes related to HRT. This study indicates that. HRT in postmenopausal women leads to an increase in TAC without an equivalent change in serum levels of oxLDL/β2GPI complexes. It is concluded that …,True,fKSStzIAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,25,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/endocrj/57/12/57_K10E-239/_article/-char/ja/,4646122809842898738,/scholar?cites=4646122809842898738,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/endocrj/57/12/57_K10E-239/_pdf,0,0,0

Cardioprotective effect of high density lipoprotein (HDL) is. in part. dependent on its related enzyme. paraoxonase 1 (PON1). Fatty acid composition of HDL could affect its size and structure. On the other hand. PON1 activity is directly related to the structure of HDL. This study was designed to investigate the association between serum PON1 activity and fatty acid composition of HDL in healthy men. Methods. One hundred and forty healthy men participated in this research. HDL was separated by sequential ultracentrifugation. and its fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography. PON1 activity was measured spectrophotometrically using paraxon as substrate. Results. Serum PON1 activity was directly correlated with the amount of stearic acid and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA). PON1/HDL-C was directly correlated with the amount of miristic acid. stearic acid. and DGLA and was inversely correlated with total amount of ω6 fatty acids of HDL. Conclusion. The fatty acid composition of HDL could affect the activity of its associated enzyme. PON1. As dietary fats are the major determinants of serum lipids and lipoprotein composition. consuming some special dietary fatty acids may improve the activity of PON1 and thereby have beneficial effects on health.,True,fKSStzIAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,21,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/dm/2013/612035/abs/,12108187791393038092,/scholar?cites=12108187791393038092,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/dm/2013/612035/abs/,0,0,0

Inc.,The estrogen receptor β (ERβ) mediates the action of estrogen on metabolism of lipids and lipoprotein. Therefore. its gene is a promising candidate gene for cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the ERβ A1730G polymorphism modifies the metabolic response to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women. The population included 60 normolipidemic postmenopausal women with equal numbers of each A1730G genotype followed during a 90-day experimental period. All subjects received oral estrogen together with a progestin therapy during the HRT. ABCA1 gene expression and serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were measured at the beginning and end of the HRT trial. At baseline. ABCA1 gene expression. lipid or lipoprotein concentrations were not significantly different among the ERβ A1730G genotype groups.
