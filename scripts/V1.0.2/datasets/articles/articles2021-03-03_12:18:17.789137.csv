1188821,α‐Synuclein: The Long Distance Runner,2013,Sonia George and L Rey and Nolwen and Nicole Reichenbach and Jennifer A. Steiner and Patrik Brundin,23,Brain Pathology,3,350-357,Wiley,Parkinson's disease is characterized by α‐synuclein pathology in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Braak et al described the spatial and temporal spread of α‐synuclein pathology in Parkinson's disease. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that α‐synuclein can transfer from cell to cell. In this review. we highlight the involvement of α‐synuclein in Parkinson's disease and in Braak's staging of Parkinson's disease pathology. We discuss whether a prion‐like mechanism of α‐synuclein spread might contribute to Parkinson's disease pathology. We describe recent studies investigating cell‐to‐cell transfer of α‐synuclein and focus our review on the long‐distance axonal transport of α‐synuclein along neurons.,True,QrAEW58AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,112,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bpa.12046,6463418073471737861,/scholar?cites=6463418073471737861,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bpa.12046,0,0,0

Recent research has revealed that α-synuclein is not just an intracellular synaptic protein but also exists extracellularly. Moreover. the transfer of misfolded α-synuclein between cells might be a crucial step in the process leading to a progressive increase in deposition of α-synuclein aggregates throughout the Parkinson’s disease brain. The revelation that α-synuclein is present outside cells has increased the interest in antibody-based therapies and opens up for the notion that microglia might play a key role in retarding Parkinson’s disease progression. The objectives of this review are to describe and contrast the use of active and passive immunotherapy in treating α-synucleinopathies and highlight the likely important role of microglia in clearing misfolded α-synuclein from the …,True,QrAEW58AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,71,https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-parkinsons-disease/jpd150630,12630266896862763925,/scholar?cites=12630266896862763925,,https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-parkinsons-disease/jpd150630,0,0,0

It is now believed that α‐syn can form small aggregates in a restricted number of cells. that propagate to neighbouring cells and seed aggregation of endogenous α‐syn. in a ‘prion‐like manner’. This process could underlie the stereotypical progression of Lewy bodies described by Braak and colleagues across different stages of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and activated microglia are present in PD and activated microglia can promote α-syn aggregation. However. it is unclear how microglia influence α-syn cell-to-cell transfer. We developed a clinically relevant mouse model to monitor α-syn prion-like propagation between cells; we transplanted wild-type mouse embryonic midbrain neurons into a mouse striatum overexpressing human α-syn (huα-syn) following adeno-associated viral injection into the substantia nigra. In this system. we depleted or activated microglial cells and determined the effects on the transfer of huα-syn from host nigrostriatal neurons into the implanted dopaminergic neurons. using the presence of huα-syn within the grafted cells as a readout. First. we compared α-syn cell-to-cell transfer between host mice with a normal number of microglia to mice in which we had pharmacologically ablated 80% of the microglia from the grafted striatum. With fewer host microglia. we observed increased accumulation of huα-syn in grafted dopaminergic neurons. Second. we assessed the transfer of α-syn into grafted neurons in the context of microglia activated by one of two stimuli. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin-4 (IL-4).

Treatment of type-2 diabetes with insulin sensitizing drugs lowers the risk of PD. We previously showed that the insulin sensitizing drug. MSDC-0160. ameliorates pathogenesis in some animal models of PD. MSDC-0160 reversibly binds the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) protein complex. which has an anti-inflammatory effect and restores metabolic deficits. Since PD is characterized by the deposition of alpha-synuclein (aSyn). we hypothesized that inhibiting the MPC might directly inhibit aSyn aggregation in vivo in mammals. To answer if modulation of MPC can reduce the development of aSyn assemblies. and reduce neurodegeneration. we treated two chronic and progressive mouse models; a viral vector-based aSyn overexpressing model and a pre-formed fibril (PFF) aSyn seeding model with MSDC-0160. These two models present with distinct types of aSyn pathology but lack inflammatory or autophagy deficits. Contrary to our hypothesis. we found that a modulation of MPC in these models did not reduce the accumulation aSyn aggregates or mitigate neurotoxicity. Instead.

Other hallmarks include activation of microglia. elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. as well as the activation of T and B cells. These immune changes point towards a dysregulation of both the innate and the adaptive immune system. T cells have been shown to recognize epitopes derived from alpha-syn and altered populations of T cells have been found in PD and MSA patients. providing evidence that these cells can be key to the pathogenesis of the disease. Objective: To study the role of the adaptive immune system with respect to alpha-syn pathology. Methods: We injected human alpha-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum of immunocompromised mice (NSG) and assessed accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-syn pathology. proteinase K-resistant alpha-syn pathology and microgliosis in the striatum. substantia nigra and frontal cortex. We also assessed the impact of adoptive transfer of naive T and B cells into PFF-injected immunocompromised mice. Results: Compared to wildtype mice. NSG mice had an 8-fold increase in phosphorylated alpha-syn pathology in the substantia nigra. Reconstituting the T cell population decreased the accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-syn pathology and resulted in persistent microgliosis in the striatum when compared to non-transplanted mice. Conclusion: Our work provides evidence that T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of experimental alpha-synucleinopathy.,True,QrAEW58AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.956599v3.full,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.956599v3.full,0,0,0

In the case of Parkinson’s disease (PD). α-synuclein (αSN). normally a highly soluble unfolded protein. forms amorphous precipitates to produce hallmark cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy Bodies. αSN was linked to PD when mutations in the αSN gene were found in a rare autosomal dominant form of the disease (Polymeropoulos et al.. 1997). Interest in αSN became acute when a shortly after. fibrillary αSN was found to be a major component of Lewy Bodies (Spillantini et al.. 1998).

The neuropathology is characterized by intraneuronal protein aggregates of α-synuclein and progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. Previous studies have shown that extracellular α-synuclein aggregates can activate microglial cells. induce inflammation and contribute to the neurodegenerative process in PD. However. the signaling pathways involved in α-synuclein-mediated microglia activation are poorly understood. Galectin-3 is a member of a carbohydrate-binding protein family involved in cell activation and inflammation. Therefore. we investigated whether galectin-3 is involved in the microglia activation triggered by α-synuclein. We cultured microglial (BV2) cells and induced cell activation by addition of exogenous α-synuclein monomers or aggregates to the cell culture medium. This treatment induced a significant increase in the levels of proinflammatory mediators including the inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS). interleukin 1 Beta (IL-1β) and Interleukin-12 (IL-12).

Both approaches led to a significant reduction in the observed inflammatory response induced by α-synuclein.

Other hallmarks include activation of microglia. elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. as well as the activation of T and B cells. These immune changes point towards a dysregulation of both the innate and the adaptive immune system. T cells have been shown to recognize epitopes derived from alpha-syn and altered populations of T cells have been found in PD and MSA patients. providing evidence that these cells can be key to the pathogenesis of the disease. Objective: To study the role of the adaptive immune system with respect to alpha-syn pathology. Methods: We injected human alpha-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum of immunocompromised mice (NSG) and assessed accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-syn pathology. proteinase K-resistant alpha-syn pathology and microgliosis in the striatum. substantia nigra and frontal cortex. We also assessed the impact of adoptive transfer of naive T and B cells into PFF-injected immunocompromised mice. Results: Compared to wildtype mice. NSG mice had an 8-fold increase in phosphorylated alpha-syn pathology in the substantia nigra. Reconstituting the T cell population decreased the accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-syn pathology and resulted in persistent microgliosis in the striatum when compared to non-transplanted mice.

Superoxide dismutases (SODs) counteract this process by detoxifying superoxide. It has previously been shown that elimination of either cytoplasmic or mitochondrial SOD in yeast. flies. and mice results in decreased lifespan. In this experiment. we examine the effect of eliminating each of the five individual sod genes present in Caenorhabditis elegans. In contrast to what is observed in other model organisms. none of the sod deletion mutants shows decreased lifespan compared to wild-type worms. despite a clear increase in sensitivity to paraquat- and juglone-induced oxidative stress. In fact. even mutants lacking combinations of two or three sod genes survive at least as long as wild-type worms. Examination of gene expression in these mutants reveals mild compensatory up-regulation of other sod genes. Interestingly. we find that sod-2 mutants are long-lived despite a significant increase in oxidatively damaged proteins. Testing the effect of sod-2 deletion on known pathways of lifespan extension reveals a clear interaction with genes that affect mitochondrial function: sod-2 deletion markedly increases lifespan in clk-1 worms while clearly decreasing the lifespan of isp-1 worms. Combined with the mitochondrial localization of SOD-2 and the fact that sod-2 mutant worms exhibit phenotypes that are characteristic of long-lived mitochondrial mutants—including slow development. low brood size. and slow defecation—this suggests that deletion of sod-2 …,True,WEaryu0AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,510,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000361,18090025874735021711,/scholar?cites=18090025874735021711,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000361,0,0,0

While the accumulation of ROS-mediated damage is widely believed to be one of the main causes of aging. ROS also act in signaling pathways. Recent work has demonstrated that increasing levels of superoxide. one form of ROS. through treatment with paraquat. results in increased lifespan. Interestingly. treatment with paraquat robustly increases the already long lifespan of the clk-1 mitochondrial mutant. but not other long-lived mitochondrial mutants such as isp-1 or nuo-6. To genetically dissect the subcellular compartment in which elevated ROS act to increase lifespan. we deleted individual superoxide dismutase (sod) genes in clk-1 mutants. which are sensitized to ROS. We find that only deletion of the primary mitochondrial sod gene. sod-2 results in increased lifespan in clk-1 worms. In contrast. deletion of either of the two cytoplasmic sod genes. sod-1 or sod-5. significantly decreases the lifespan of clk-1 worms. Further. we show that increasing mitochondrial superoxide levels through deletion of sod-2 or treatment with paraquat can still increase lifespan in clk-1;sod-1 double mutants. which live shorter than clk-1 worms. The fact that mitochondrial superoxide can increase lifespan in worms with a detrimental level of cytoplasmic superoxide demonstrates that ROS have a compartment specific effect on lifespan – elevated ROS in the mitochondria acts to increase lifespan. while elevated ROS in the cytoplasm decreases lifespan.

To dissect the underlying mechanisms. we use C. elegans transcriptional reporter strains that measure the activation of different stress responses including: the heat shock response. mitochondrial unfolded protein response. endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response. hypoxia response. SKN-1-mediated oxidative stress response. and the DAF-16-mediated stress response. We find that the decline in stress resistance with age is at least partially due to a decreased ability to activate protective mechanisms in response to stress.

However. to date the molecular functions of AGR2 remain to be characterized. Herein we have identified AGR2 as bound to newly synthesized cargo proteins using a proteomics analysis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-bound ribosomes. Nascent protein chains that translocate into the ER associate with specific ER luminal proteins. which in turn ensures proper folding and posttranslational modifications. Using both imaging and biochemical approaches. we confirmed that AGR2 localizes to the lumen of the ER and indirectly associates with ER membrane-bound ribosomes through nascent protein chains. We showed that AGR2 expression is controlled by the unfolded protein response and is in turn is involved in the maintenance of ER …,True,Ij9rqUEAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,87,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820655338,14088226105651311812,/scholar?cites=14088226105651311812,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820655338,0,0,0

The initial success rate using a standard PCR protocol required for ligation‐independent cloning was 83.4%. Logistic regression analysis was conducted on 27 primer‐ and template‐related characteristics. of which most could be ignored apart from those related to the GC content of the template. Overall GC content of the template was a good predictor for PCR success; however. specificity and sensitivity values for predicted outcome were improved to 84.3 and 94.8%. respectively. when regionalized GC content was employed. This represented a significant improvement in predictability with respect to GC content alone (P < 0.001; χ2) and is expected to increase in relative sensitivity as template size increases.

However. several studies have noted that glycogen with short average chain length in some bacteria is degraded very slowly. In addition. slow utilization of glycogen is correlated with bacterial viability. that is. the slower the glycogen breakdown rate. the longer the bacterial survival time in the external environment under starvation conditions. We call that a durable energy storage mechanism (DESM). In this review. evidence from microbiology. biochemistry. and molecular biology will be assembled to support the hypothesis of glycogen as a durable energy storage compound.

1188938,Heuristic RNA pseudoknot prediction including intramolecular kissing hairpins,2011,Jana Sperschneider and Amitava Datta and Michael J Wise,17,Rna,1,27-38,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,Pseudoknots are an essential feature of RNA tertiary structures. Simple H-type pseudoknots have been studied extensively in terms of biological functions. computational prediction. and energy models. Intramolecular kissing hairpins are a more complex and biologically important type of pseudoknot in which two hairpin loops form base pairs. They are hard to predict using free energy minimization due to high computational requirements. Heuristic methods that allow arbitrary pseudoknots strongly depend on the quality of energy parameters. which are not yet available for complex pseudoknots. We present an extension of the heuristic pseudoknot prediction algorithm DotKnot. which covers H-type pseudoknots and intramolecular kissing hairpins. Our framework allows for easy integration of advanced H-type pseudoknot energy models.

1188939,Expression profiling and cross-species RNA interference (RNAi) of desiccation-induced transcripts in the anhydrobiotic nematode Aphelenchus avenae,2010,Wesley Reardon and Sohini Chakrabortee and Tiago Campos Pereira and Trevor Tyson and Matthew C Banton and Katharine M Dolan and Bridget A Culleton and Michael J Wise and Ann M Burnell and Alan Tunnacliffe,11,,1,1-18,BioMed Central,Some organisms can survive extreme desiccation by entering a state of suspended animation known as anhydrobiosis. The free-living mycophagous nematode Aphelenchus avenae can be induced to enter anhydrobiosis by pre-exposure to moderate reductions in relative humidity (RH) prior to extreme desiccation. This preconditioning phase is thought to allow modification of the transcriptome by activation of genes required for desiccation tolerance. To identify such genes. a panel of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) enriched for sequences upregulated in A. avenae during preconditioning was created. A subset of 30 genes with significant matches in databases. together with a number of apparently novel sequences. were chosen for further study. Several of the recognisable genes are associated with water stress. encoding. for example. two new hydrophilic proteins related to the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein family. Expression studies confirmed EST panel members to be upregulated by evaporative water loss. and the majority of genes was also induced by osmotic stress and cold. but rather fewer by heat. We attempted to use RNA interference (RNAi) to demonstrate the importance of this gene set for anhydrobiosis. but found A. avenae to be recalcitrant with the techniques used. Instead. therefore. we developed a cross-species RNAi procedure using A. avenae sequences in another anhydrobiotic nematode. Panagrolaimus superbus. which is amenable to gene silencing. Of 20 A. avenae ESTs screened. a significant reduction in survival of desiccation in treated P. superbus populations was observed with two sequences. one of …,True,Ij9rqUEAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,47,https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2199-11-6,16768441312010849634,/scholar?cites=16768441312010849634,,https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2199-11-6,0,0,0
1188940,Neweyes: a system for comparing biological sequences using the running Karp-Rabin Greedy String-Tiling algorithm.,1995,Michael J Wise,,,,393-401,,A system for aligning nucleotide or amino acid biosequences is described. The system. called Neweyes. employs a novel string matching algorithm. Running Karp-Rabin Greedy String T’ding (RKR--GST). which involves tiling one string with matching substrings of a second string. In practice. RKR-GST has a computational complexity that appears close to linear. With RKR-GST. Neweyes is able to detect transposed substrings or substrings of one biosequence that appears rearranged in a second sequence. Repeated substrings can also be detected. Neweyes also supports a form of matching-by-group that gives the effect of different amino acid mutation matrices. Neweyes can be used in a macro mode (searching database for a list of biosequences that are similar to a given biosequence) or in a micro mode. where two biosequences are compared and more detailed output formats are available.,True,Ij9rqUEAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,41,https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ISMB/1995/ISMB95-047.pdf,15407988702727623114,/scholar?cites=15407988702727623114,,https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ISMB/1995/ISMB95-047.pdf,0,0,0

Wise,39,The Computer Journal,9,741-750,Oxford University Press,Early automated systems for detecting plagiarism in student programs employed attribute counting techniques in their comparisons of program texts. while more recent systems use encoded structural information. Whales claims that the latter are more effective in their detection of plagiarisms than systems based on attribute counting. To explore the validity of these claims. a comparison is presented of five systems. two based on attribute counting and three using metrics based on structure. The major result of this study is that the systems based on structural information consistently equal or better the performance of systems based on attribute counting metrics. A second conclusion is that of the structure metric systems. one using approximate tokenization of input texts (YAP) is as effective as a system that undertakes a complete parse (Plague).

Due in part to a lack of markers. these cells have not been well characterized in vivo and their function remains unknown. We have used murine macrophages elicited by nematode infection (NeMφ) as a source of in vivo derived alternatively activated macrophages. Using three distinct yet complementary molecular approaches we have established a gene expression profile of alternatively activated macrophages and identified macrophage genes that are regulated in vivo by IL-4. First. genes abundantly expressed were identified by an expressed sequence tag strategy. Second. an array of 1176 known mouse genes was screened for differential expression between NeMφ from wild type or IL-4 deficient mice.

In this study. intracellular bacteria were observed in tissues of the rodent parasite Litomosoides sigmodontis by transmission electron microscopy and by immunohistochemistry using antiendobacterial heat shock protein-60 antisera.

This approach has broad potential for genetic analysis of non-model organisms including genotype-phenotype association mapping. phylogeography. population genetics and scaffolding genome assemblies through linkage mapping. We constructed a RAD library using genomic DNA from a Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth) backcross that segregated for resistance to the insecticide spinosad. Sequencing of 24 individuals was performed on a single Illumina GAIIx lane (51 base paired-end reads). Taking advantage of the lack of crossing over in homologous chromosomes in female Lepidoptera. 3.177 maternally inherited RAD alleles were assigned to the 31 chromosomes. enabling identification of the spinosad resistance and W/Z sex chromosomes. Paired-end reads for each RAD allele were assembled into contigs and compared to the genome of Bombyx mori (n = 28) using BLAST. revealing 28 homologous matches plus 3 expected fusion/breakage events which account for the difference in chromosome number. A genome-wide linkage map (1292 cM) was inferred with 2.878 segregating RAD alleles inherited from the backcross father. producing chromosome and location specific sequenced RAD markers. Here we have used RAD sequencing to construct a genetic linkage map de novo for an organism that has no previous genome data.

Meiofaunal identification is confounded by the small size of taxa. morphological convergence and intraspecific variation. However. the most important restricting factor in meiofaunal ecological research is the mismatch between diversity and the number of taxonomists that are able to simultaneously identify and catalogue meiofaunal diversity.

We explore the performance of existing analysis tools given these biases and discuss approaches to limiting or handling biases in RAD‐Seq data.

Once the tens to hundreds of thousands of short (250-450 base) reads have been produced. it is important to correctly assemble these to estimate the sequence of all the transcripts. Most transcriptome assembly projects use only one program for assembling 454 pyrosequencing reads. but there is no evidence that the programs used to date are optimal. We have carried out a systematic comparison of five assemblers (CAP3. MIRA. Newbler. SeqMan and CLC) to establish best practices for transcriptome assemblies. using a new dataset from the parasitic nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis. Although no single assembler performed best on all our criteria. Newbler 2.5 gave longer contigs. better alignments to some reference sequences. and was fast and easy to use. SeqMan assemblies performed best on the criterion of recapitulating known transcripts. and had more novel sequence than the other assemblers. but generated an excess of small. redundant contigs. The remaining assemblers all performed almost as well. with the exception of Newbler 2.3 (the version currently used by most assembly projects). which generated assemblies that had significantly lower total length. As different assemblers use different underlying algorithms to generate contigs. we also explored merging of assemblies and found that the merged datasets not only aligned better to reference sequences than individual assemblies. but were also more consistent in the number and size of contigs.

Family history data suggest a genetic component; however. the majority of prostate cancer cases cannot be explained by a single-gene model. Prostate cell division is influenced by two steroid hormones. testosterone and vitamin D. the action of each being mediated by its respective receptor. The genes for the two receptors are candidates in a multigenic model for prostate cancer susceptibility.              Purpose:              We examined genetic polymorphisms in two steroid receptors. the androgen receptor (AR) and the vitamin D receptor (VDR). in a case-control pilot study of prostate cancer.

While the accumulation of ROS-mediated damage is widely believed to be one of the main causes of aging. ROS also act in signaling pathways. Recent work has demonstrated that increasing levels of superoxide. one form of ROS. through treatment with paraquat. results in increased lifespan. Interestingly. treatment with paraquat robustly increases the already long lifespan of the clk-1 mitochondrial mutant. but not other long-lived mitochondrial mutants such as isp-1 or nuo-6. To genetically dissect the subcellular compartment in which elevated ROS act to increase lifespan. we deleted individual superoxide dismutase (sod) genes in clk-1 mutants. which are sensitized to ROS. We find that only deletion of the primary mitochondrial sod gene. sod-2 results in increased lifespan in clk-1 worms. In contrast. deletion of either of the two cytoplasmic sod genes. sod-1 or sod-5. significantly decreases the lifespan of clk-1 worms. Further. we show that increasing mitochondrial superoxide levels through deletion of sod-2 or treatment with paraquat can still increase lifespan in clk-1;sod-1 double mutants. which live shorter than clk-1 worms. The fact that mitochondrial superoxide can increase lifespan in worms with a detrimental level of cytoplasmic superoxide demonstrates that ROS have a compartment specific effect on lifespan – elevated ROS in the mitochondria acts to increase lifespan. while elevated ROS in the cytoplasm decreases lifespan.

This pathway has been proposed to influence lifespan. with studies suggesting that mitoUPR activation has complex effects on longevity. Here. we examined the contribution of the mitoUPR to the survival and lifespan of three long-lived mitochondrial mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans by modulating the levels of ATFS-1. the central transcription factor that mediates the mitoUPR. We found that clk-1. isp-1. and nuo-6 worms all exhibit an ATFS-1-dependent activation of the mitoUPR. While loss of atfs-1 during adulthood does not affect lifespan in any of these strains. absence of atfs-1 during development prevents clk-1 and isp-1 worms from reaching adulthood and reduces the lifespan of nuo-6 mutants. Examining the mechanism by which deletion of atfs-1 reverts nuo-6 lifespan to wild-type. we find that many of the transcriptional changes present in nuo-6 worms are mediated by ATFS-1. Genes exhibiting an ATFS-1-dependent upregulation in nuo-6 worms are enriched for transcripts that function in stress response and metabolism. Consistent. with this finding. loss of atfs-1 abolishes the enhanced stress resistance observed in nuo-6 mutants and prevents upregulation of multiple stress response pathways including the HIF-1-mediated hypoxia response.

In addition to SNCA. an increasing number of other genes have been implicated in PD. While mutations in at least some of these genes have been shown to cause the formation of Lewy bodies. the role of α-synuclein in these genetic forms of PD remains poorly defined.

We isolated GA in a screen for drugs active in vivo against two different yeast prions using a previously described yeast-based two steps assay. GA was then shown to promote ovine PrPSc clearance in a cell-based assay. These effects are very specific as evidenced by the lack of activity of some GA analogues that we generated. GA antiprion activity does not involve its agonist activity on α2-adrenergic receptors as other chemically close anti-hypertensive agents possessing related mechanism of action were found inactive against prions. Finally. GA showed activity in a transgenic mouse-based in vivo assay for ovine prion propagation. prolonging slightly but significantly the survival of treated animals.Conclusion/SignificanceGA thus adds to the short list of compounds active in vivo in animal models for the treatment of prion-based diseases.

Since the number of asymptomatic infected donors remains unresolved. inter-individual v-CJD transmission through blood and blood derived products is a major public health concern. Current risk assessments for transmission of v-CJD by blood and blood derived products by transfusion rely on infectious titers measured in rodent models of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) using intra-cerebral (IC) inoculation of blood components. To address the biological relevance of this approach. we compared the efficiency of TSE transmission by blood and blood components when administrated either through transfusion in sheep or by intra-cerebral inoculation (IC) in transgenic mice (tg338) over-expressing ovine PrP. Transfusion of 200 µL of blood from asymptomatic infected donor sheep transmitted prion disease with 100% efficiency thereby displaying greater virulence than the transfusion of 200 mL of normal blood spiked with brain homogenate material containing 103ID50 as measured by intracerebral inoculation of tg338 mice (ID50 IC in tg338).

More recently. secondary vCJD cases were identified in patients transfused with blood products prepared from apparently healthy donors who later went on to develop the disease. As there is no validated assay for detection of vCJD/BSE infected individuals the prevalence of the disease in the population remains uncertain. In that context. the risk of vCJD blood borne transmission is considered as a serious concern by health authorities. In this study. appropriate conditions and substrates for highly efficient and specific in vitro amplification of vCJD/BSE agent using Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) were first identified. This showed that whatever the origin (species) of the vCJD/BSE agent. the ovine Q171 PrP substrates provided the best amplification performances.

These structurally unrelated molecules are also active against mammalian prion in several cell-based assays and in vivo in a mouse model for prion-based diseases.Methodology/Principal FindingsHere we report the identification of cellular targets of these drugs. Using affinity chromatography matrices for both drugs. we demonstrate an RNA-dependent interaction of 6AP and GA with the ribosome. These specific interactions have no effect on the peptidyl transferase activity of the ribosome or on global translation. In contrast. 6AP and GA specifically inhibit the ribosomal RNA-mediated protein folding activity of the ribosome.Conclusion/Significance6AP and GA are therefore the first compounds to selectively inhibit the protein folding activity of the ribosome.

In a previous work. we showed that sequences located downstream of a strong promoter are particularly prone to deletion. In this paper. the parameters that influence transcription‐induced deletions were studied. pBR322 derivatives carrying the M13 (+) replication origin and a PTac‐dependent transcription region were used. Deletion formation was analysed in the presence of the replication protein of M13. which introduces a nick at the phage replication origin. and in a rep− strain to avoid M13‐driven replication.

In several species. including humans. polymorphisms in the gene encoding the PrP protein tightly control susceptibility of individuals toward this disease. In the present study we show that Rov cells expressing an ovine PrP allele (VRQPrP) associated with high susceptibility of sheep to scrapie were very sensitive to sheep prion transmission and replicated the agent to high titers. In contrast. we did not find any evidence of infection when Rov cells expressed similar levels of a PrP variant (ARRPrP) linked to resistance. Our data provide the first direct evidence that natural PrP polymorphisms may affect prion susceptibility by controlling prion replication at the cell level.

Tandem repeats 624 bp long were introduced into the lacZ gene of E. coli and the efficiency of deletion of one repeat was compared in different recombination mutants. No effects of the recA. recBC. recF. ruvA or ruvA recG mutations were detected. Hence. tandem repeat deletion appears to not proceed via the RecBCD or RecF homologous recombination pathways. A new mutant in which RecA‐independent recombination is increased 15‐fold was isolated. The mutation lies in the dnaE gene coding for the alpha subunit of polymerase III: it is a Gly to Asp change at codon 133. Another dnaE mutation. dnaE486. was tested and also shown to stimulate RecA‐independent recombination. It is proposed that tandem‐repeat recombination occurs by a replication slippage mechanism.

Experimental study of TSE infectious agents from sheep and other species essentially depends on bioassays in rodents. Transmission of natural sheep scrapie to conventional mice commonly requires one or two years. In an effort to develop laboratory models in which investigations on the sheep TSE agent would be facilitated. we have established mice and cell lines that were genetically engineered to express ovine PrP protein and examined their susceptibility to the infection. A series of transgenic mice lines (tgOv) expressing the high susceptibility allele (VRQ) of the ovine PrP gene from different constructs was expanded.

This paper invokes information science and computer science to provide clues for a better understanding of the stopword lists’ origin and purpose. and how they fit in the mapping algorithm. Further. it stresses the need for stopword lists that depend on the document corpus analyzed.

1189160,Science Blogs in Research and Popularization of Science: Why. how and for whom?,2011,Antoine Blanchard,,,,219,EPFL Press,As the Internet emerged as an efficient channel for sending information and fostering collaborations on a global scale. this unanticipated phenomenon paved the way for a new era of science. namely e-science or digital scholarship (Borgman. 2007). Massive data repositories moved online. academic publications (preprints and articles alike) became searchable across disciplinary boundaries. collaborations grew larger. But the Internet is now developing into so-called web 2.0. where active participation is replacing passive broadcasting: every user can become their own media maker and share videos. images or text. To date. the most popular form for the latter are blogs (short for web-logs). The blog format was originally used for online diaries but has rapidly evolved into a versatile publication and conversation tool.This shift is also being embraced by scientists. on a limited. albeit growing scale. First isolated. then grouped in communities. science bloggers (I use the term to include professional scientists as well as students. journalists. science amateurs. science museums. concerned groups…) have already demonstrated the potential to influence how research is done. results are communicated and the public is reached. Among the many topics that blogs discuss. I will focus here on science and the academic life. thus defining a type of “science blogging” that is effectively turning digital scholarship into conversational scholarship (Gregg. 2006).

Malheureusement. les pesticides ont une mauvaise image dans le public (en témoigne l’actuelle campagne de communication menée par l’UIPP) et sont de plus en plus sur la sellette pour des questions de toxicité. de pollution. . . Il se pose également le problème de l’efficacité des produits phytosanitaires qui. comme les antibiotiques utilisés en médecine humaine. voient des résistances apparaître qui les rendent inefficaces. Face à ces limitations. l’industrie agrochimique piétine et le développement de nouvelles substances actives – et encore plus de nouvelles familles – semble de plus en plus difficile. Or il existe des voies pour sortir de cette impasse qui révisent complètement les paradigmes régissant la lutte contre les ennemis des cultures. L’une d’entre elles consiste à donner aux plantes les moyens de se défendre elles-même. ou renforcer leurs propres moyens de défense. plutôt que de combattre directement l’agresseur. Dans cette catégorie se trouvent les stimulateurs des défenses naturelles des plantes (SDN). une solution intéressante sur les plans scientifique et agronomique. et qui pourrait bien être une solution d’avenir.

Through the advent of a novel class of objects at the end of the 1970s in Europe and the USA. namely plant elicitors that trigger the plant’s own defence reactions. we witness how dissent between epistemic communities appears where assimilation had been the rule. The convergence between the industry and the academia as a coherent “phytosanitary universe”. despite the fact that they are made of several epistemic communities. is put to the test by plant elicitors. which do not fit exactly within existing categories.

Le manifeste cite pêle-mêle «encodage de sources textuelles. systèmes d’information géographique. lexicométrie. numérisation du patrimoine culturel. scientifique et technique. cartographie du web. fouille de données. 3D. archives orales. arts et littératures numériques et hypermédiatiques»(collectif. 2011). Nous avons choisi de détailler quatre de ces concepts clés qui nous tiennent à cœur:-la numérisation;-la participation;-la sémantique;-l’interopérabilité. Une fois ces notions introduites. nous examinerons si la profusion d’outils «prêts à l’emploi». doublée d’une communauté de pratiques très active favorisant la reproduction. ne risquent pas d’entraîner les humanités numériques vers un «prêt à penser». Nous montrerons alors par un retour d’expérience à quel point la construction de nouveaux outils numériques peut elle-même être un moteur heuristique de la pensée en sciences humaines et sociales.,True,iTiBEJYAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1204247741246648355&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1204247741246648355,/scholar?cites=1204247741246648355,,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01248081/document,0,0,0

Exosome secretion can be used by cells to eject molecules targeted to intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. but particular cell types may exploit exosomes as intercellular communication devices for transfer of proteins and lipids among cells. The glycosylphosphatyidylinositol-linked prion protein (PrP) in both its normal (PrPc) and scrappie (PrPsc) conformation is associated with exosomes. Targeting of exosomes containing the normal cellular PrP could confer susceptibility of cells that do not express PrP to prion multiplication. Furthermore. exosomes bearing proteinase-K resistant PrPsc are infectious. suggesting a model in which exosomes secreted by infected cells could serve as vehicles for propagation of prions.

In keratinocytes. the inhibition of E2F is a key step in the control and initiation of squamous differentiation. Because the product of the recently identified E2F7a/E2F7b gene has been shown to repress E2F-regulated promoters. and to be abundant in skin. we examined its role in the epidermis.

In order to gain better insight into this critical issue. this study used two different cell lines (neuroglial MovS and epithelial Rov cells) that have previously been shown to be permissive for ovine prion multiplication. Co-culture of infected cells and uninfected target cells at a ratio of 1 : 9 resulted in total infection of MovS cells within 10 days but not of Rov cell cultures. suggesting that the efficiency of prion dissemination may vary greatly depending on the type of permissive cell. Analysis of the spatial distribution of the newly infected cells revealed that. although long-range spread could also occur. cells proximal to the infected donor cells consistently accumulated more abnormal PrP. consistent with preferential infection of nearby cells.

We demonstrate that abnormal PrP (PrPSc) and prion infectivity are efficiently internalized in Rov cells. whether or not PrPc is expressed. At odds with earlier studies implicating cellular heparan sulfates in PrPSc internalization. we failed to find any involvement of such molecules in Rov cells. indicating that prions can enter target cells by several routes. We further show that PrPSc taken up in the absence of PrPc was unable to promote efficient prion multiplication once PrPc expression was restored in the cells.

SDF-1 (CXCL12). in human corneal fibroblasts.Methods: Human corneal fibroblast cultures were obtained using human donor corneas. CXCR4 receptors were characterized using binding studies and autoradiography with [125I] SDF-1. The functionality of CXCR4 receptors was assessed by intracellular calcium measurement using a dynamic imaging microscopy system. CXCR4 and SDF-1 mRNA were detected in human corneal fibroblasts using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The CXCR4 protein was detected by western blot analysis.Results:[125I] SDF-1 specifically bound to cultured corneal fibroblasts with a KD value of 8.3±1.2 nM. The presence of CXCR4 was confirmed by autoradiography of the radioligand on slices of corneal stroma. SDF-1 induced a rapid and transient intracellular calcium increase in cultured corneal fibroblasts that was blocked by the specific antagonist bicyclam. Moreover. a 48 kDa protein was detected by western blot analysis of corneal fibroblast extracts. using a specific CXCR4 polyclonal antibody. RT-PCR showed the expression of both CXCR4 and SDF-1 mRNAs in human corneal fibroblasts. Conclusions: These results indicate for the first time that cultured human corneal fibroblasts express the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and its ligand SDF-1.

Que le point d’appui d’un discours sur cette pratique soit la théologie. le droit. l’anthropologie. la littérature ou des entretiens. elle apparaîtra toujours comme n’ayant pas d’existence en soi. mais relative à ce qui la précède ou à ce qui lui succède. Les fiançailles n’ayant pas fait l’objet d’un «. investissement de forme.». travail de construction sociale de leur existence autonome. les schèmes permettant de les penser autrement ne sont pas aisément mobilisables.,True,09xFCcMAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,7,https://journals.openedition.org/assr/1716?file=1,5274036728618583885,/scholar?cites=5274036728618583885,,https://journals.openedition.org/assr/1716?file=1,0,0,0
1189230,Changer de prénom. De l'identité à l'authenticité,2016,Baptiste Coulmont,,,,,Presses universitaires de Lyon,Changer de prénom. c’est chercher à «devenir soi-même»(ou redevenir soi-même). De nombreux travaux ont pointé les injonctions contemporaines à être authentique sans insister sur les outils aux mains des personnes cherchant à fabriquer leur authenticité. Pour le dire autrement: changer de prénom n’est pas seulement répondre à la question «qui suis-je?»(à la question de l’identité ou de l’identification étatique). mais c’est aussi répondre à la question de l’authenticité:«qui suis-je en vérité?». Identité et authenticité sont ainsi en tension dans les dossiers judiciaires. À travers une étude de la jurisprudence (soixante ans d’arrêts de cours d’appel. plusieurs dizaines d’observations d’audiences dans les tribunaux) et plusieurs mois de travail dans les archives des greffes. Baptiste Coulmont analyse comment le droit. petit à petit. en est venu à considérer le prénom non plus seulement sous l’angle de ses fonctions d’élément de l’état civil. à savoir sa capacité à identifier précisément un individu. mais aussi sous l’angle de ses fonctions connotatives: la capacité du prénom à indiquer l’appartenance à un groupe. S’est ainsi construit un «droit à devenir soi-même». reconnu à présent par des juristes et des magistrats. On peut dès lors déployer une sociologie empirique de la fabrique de l’authenticité. en étudiant. à travers les archives judiciaires. les contextes où elle se manifeste concrètement. Autant d’histoires singulières qui racontent tour à tour le rapport de l’individu à son corps ou à son genre. ou encore à son sentiment d’appartenance nationale.,True,09xFCcMAAAAJ:wE-fMHVdjMkC,6,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12658597926631871995&hl=en&oi=scholarr,12658597926631871995,/scholar?cites=12658597926631871995,,,0,0,0

1189234,Changer de prénom,2016,Baptiste Coulmont,,De l’identité à l’authenticité. Lyon: Presses universitaires de Lyon,,,,L’objectif de cette recherche était de comprendre la procédure de changement de prénom. qui existe sous la forme actuelle depuis 1993 (Loi n 93-22 du 8 janvier 1993 modifiant le code civil). Depuis vingt ans. donc. une personne souhaitant changer de prénom doit faire appel à un avocat et déposer une requête auprès du juge aux affaires familiales du Tribunal de grande instance. C’est une procédure qui aboutit très souvent de manière favorable: environ 92% des demandes sont acceptées. et certains juges ont pu proposer de la «déjudiciariser». proposition reprise dans un rapport officiel [Guinchard. 2008. p. 67]. C’est une procédure qui. pour le sociologue. est susceptible de révéler un pan méconnu de la construction identitaire. L’enquête cherche donc à saisir comment une technique d’identification (le prénom fixe). utilisée par l’Etat pour s’ assurer de l’identité de citoyen. devient pour les individus ainsi identifiés un moyen d’assurer leur identité personnelle. Le prénom est. entre le début du XIXe siècle et le milieu du XXe siècle. devenu cette chose fixe. immuable pour l’État et pour les individus. Et ces derniers se sont de plus en plus appuyés sur le prénom pour se résumer.Le prénom (qui prend. avec la sécularisation de l’état civil au moment de la Révolution. la succession du «nom de baptême»). est défini dans le droit du XIXe siècle comme immuable: alors qu’il était possible de changer de nom. le changement de prénom n’était pas prévu.

L‘examen généalogique et archéologique du concept montre une diversité des représentations. Nous cherchons à montrer que la culture de l‘information repose sur divers héritages qui font d‘elle une culture technique au sens de Simondon. c'est-à-dire une culture qui ne repose pas sur le seul usage mais sur la compréhension de l‘objet technique. Ce positionnement que Simondon qualifie de majeur face à la technique est proche de du statut de majorité de l‘entendement tel que le définit Kant dans son texte sur les Lumières. Nous examinons également les proximités avec lrinformation literacy dont la culture de l‘information constitue une des traductions possibles. Les évolutions des usages notamment liés au numérique font apparaître une convergence médiatique. bien mise en avant par Henry Jenkins. et qui sont le sujet d‘étude de nombreuses littératies et notamment de la translittératie. La nécessité d‘une formation commune et plus rationnelle apparaît face à la diversité des enjeux numériques. informationnels et institutionnels. La culture de l‘information devient de plus en plus une culture de la communication ou des hypomnemata selon la définition de Stiegler.

Trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is observed at the promoters of a wide variety of important genes. especially for mammalian development. and contributes to gene silencing. Demethylase Jumonji domain-containing 3 (Jmjd3) catalyzes the transition of H3K27me3 to H3K27me1. therefore from a repressive to an active status of gene expression. Jmjd3 plays important roles in cell differentiation. inflammation. and tumorigenesis by targeting distinct transcription factors.

1189280,Exogenous and Endogenous Stem Cells for Skeletal Regeneration,2018,Heng Zhu and Bo Yu and Liu Yang,2018,,,,Hindawi,The optimized applications of stem cells for skeletal reconstruction have been gaining more and more attention in the past decades. Generally. the exogenous multipotent cells are obtained from numerous connective tissues including adipose tissues. bones. and cartilages; expanded in an appropriate cell culture system in vitro; and intravenously delivered into the bodies or injected into skeletal tissues. These exogenous stem cells are expected to arrive in the tissue niches. differentiate into specialized skeletal cells. and protect the skeletal tissues from harmful stimuli. However. the underlying mechanisms of the regenerative effects of exogenous stem cells and the potential influences of the in vitro expansion on the stem cell biological characteristics remained largely elusive. which have confined the clinical applications of stem cells for skeletal regeneration. In accordance with the therapeutic effects of exogenous stem cells in skeletal reconstruction. endogenous stem cells are known now to be involved in skeletal repair. Upon the in vitro and in vivo stimuli. these tissue-specific stem cells proliferate. migrate to the specialized tissue niches. and differentiate to reconstruct the skeletal structure and function. Also. the precise regenerative mechanisms of endogenous stem cells are incompletely understood. Therefore. more details of the regenerative effects of both exogenous stem cells and endogenous stem cells. and their underlying mechanisms would be helpful to guide us in improving stem cell-based skeletal reconstruction.

The hair follicle (HF) dermal condensate (DC) is a cluster of cells critical for HF development and regeneration. Events that presage emergence of this distinctive population are poorly understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing and in vivo methods. we infer a sequence of transcriptional states through which DC cells pass that begins prior to HF morphogenesis. Our data indicate that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required to progress into an intermediate stage that precedes quiescence and differentiation.

Its chemical composition. ie. lignin hinders ethanol production and commercialization. Pretreatment processes are vital for efficient separation of the complex interlinked components and enhance the availability of every component. ie. cellulose and hemicellulose. However. for the bioethanol production. a major barrier is the removal of strong lignin component which is highly resistant to solubilization and a major inhibitor for hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose. Pretreatment of biomass is necessary to make it susceptible to microorganisms. enzymes. and pathogens.

The Brassicaceae genus Boechera comprises of both sexual and apomictic species. permitting comparative analyses of meiotic circumvention (apomeiosis) and parthenogenesis. Whereas previous studies reported local transcriptome changes during these events. it remained unclear whether global changes associated with hybridization. polyploidy and environmental adaptation that arose during evolution of Boechera might hint as (epi)genetic regulators of early development prior apomictic initiation. To identify these signatures during vegetative stages. we compared seedling RNA-seq transcriptomes of an obligate triploid apomict and a diploid sexual. both isolated from a drought-prone habitat. Uncovered were several genes differentially expressed between sexual and apomictic seedlings. including homologues of meiotic genes ASYNAPTIC 1 (ASY1) and MULTIPOLAR SPINDLE 1 (MPS1) that were down-regulated in apomicts. An intriguing class of apomict-specific deregulated genes included several NAC transcription factors. homologues of which are known to be transcriptionally reprogrammed during abiotic stress in other plants. Deregulation of both meiotic and stress-response genes during seedling stages might possibly be important in preparation for meiotic circumvention. as similar transcriptional alteration was discernible in apomeiotic floral buds too.

The Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association,10,237-241,,OBJECTIVE: To assess bacteriological quality of drinking water in Punjab and to evaluate usefulness of H2S strip test in comparison with multiple tube test. METHOD: Samples of water were tested using H2S strips and multiple tube test. RESULTS: Maximum bacterial contamination was observed in water from domestic pumps (95.83%). Followed by tap water in rural areas of Punjab (91.30%) and tap water in Lahore (42.85%). Bacterial contamination was significantly higher (p< 0.001) in rural areas as compared to urban areas. Comparison of results of testing water samples by H2S strip test and multiple tube test revealed that H2S strip is 87.24% sensitive and 100% specific for detection of bacterial contamination with a positive predictive value of 100%. It was also observed that 100% water samples negative for total coliforms were also negative by H2S strip method. Moreover. with increase in number of total coliforms in the water samples. positivity by H2S strip method also increased (samples with more than 10 total coliforms/100 ml were 100% positive by H2S strip method). Therefore. H2S strip test can be used as alternative to multiple tube test for detection of bacterial contamination of water supplies.

One method to overcome the traffic problem is to develop an intelligent traffic control system which is based on the measurement of traffic density on the road using real time video and image processing techniques. The theme is to control the traffic by determining the traffic density on each side of the road and control the traffic signal intelligently by using the density information. In this paper we proposed the algorithm to determine the number of vehicles on the road.

They are immensely important in evolution because they markedly enlarge the genetic repertoire from which natural selection chooses. General recombination is the process by which DNA strands are exchanged between homologous chromosomes. essentially at any site. In bacteria. the RecA protein is essential for homologous genetic recombination. recombinational DNA repair. and induction of the SOS response.

NRC-1 (Halo-RNase H1) is characterized by the abundance of acidic residues on the surface. including bi/quad-aspartate site residues. Halo-RNase H1 exists in partially folded (I) and native (N) states in low-salt and high-salt conditions respectively. Its folding is also induced by divalent metal ions. To understand this unique folding mechanism of Halo-RNase H1. the active site mutant (2A-RNase H1). the bi/quad-aspartate site mutant (6A-RNase H1). and the mutant at both sites (8A-RNase H1) were constructed. The far-UV CD spectra of these mutants suggest that 2A-RNase H1 mainly exists in the I state. 6A-RNase H1 exists both in the I and N states. and 8A-RNase H1 mainly exists in the N state in a low salt-condition. These results suggest that folding of Halo-RNase H1 is induced by binding of divalent metal ions to the bi/quad-aspartate site. To examine whether metal-induced folding is unique to Halo-RNase H1. RNase H2 from the same organism (Halo-RNase H2) was overproduced and purified. Halo-RNase H2 exists in the I and N states in low-salt and high-salt conditions respectively. as does Halo-RNase H1. However. this protein exists in the I state even in the presence of divalent metal ions. Halo-RNase H2 exhibits junction ribonuclease activity only in a high-salt condition.

1189446,Studies on the folding mechanism of halophilic RNase H1 and role of type 1 RNase H in DNA repair,2014,Elias Tannous,,,,,,Halo-RNase H1 is an acidic type 1 RNase H from extreme halophilic archaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. Studies on its folding by CD spectroscopy and determination of its crystal structure indicate that suppression of negative charge repulsion on the protein surface by salt or by binding of divalent metal ions to the bi/quadraspartate sites is necessary for its folding. Cleavage of Okazaki fragmentlike substrate and doublerstranded DNA (dsDNA) containing a single ribonucleotide by Halo-RNase H1 and E. coli RNase H1 indicates that both enzymes exhibit 3'-junction ribonuclease (3'-JRNase) activity and cleave these substrates at the (5') RNA-DNA (3) junction.

1189447,Structural basis for salt-dependent folding of ribonuclease H1,2014,Dong-Ju You and Nujarin Jongruja and Elias Tannous and Clement Angkawidjaja and Yuichi Koga and Shigenori Kanaya,,,,,,28 RNase H1 from extreme halophilic archaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (Halo-RNase H1) requires P2 M 29 NaCl. P10 mM MnCl2. or P300 mM MgCl2 for folding. To understand the structural basis for this 30 salt-dependent folding of Halo-RNase H1. the crystal structure of Halo-RNase H1was determined in 31 the presence of 10 mM MnCl2. The structure of Halo-RNase H1 highly resembles those of metagen-32 ome-derived LC11-RNase H1 and Sulfolobus tokodaii RNase H1 (Sto-RNase H1). except that it contains 33 two Mn2+ ions at the active site and has three bi-aspartate sites on its surface. To examine whether nega-34 tive charge repulsion at these sites are responsible for low-salt denaturation of Halo-RNase H1. a series of 35 the mutant proteins of Halo-RNase H1 at these sites were constructed. The far-UV CD spectra of these 36 mutant proteins measured in the presence of various concentrations of NaCl suggest that these mutant 37 proteins exist in an equilibrium between a partially folded state and a folded state. However. the fraction 38 of the protein in a folded state is nearly 0% for the active site mutant. 40% for the bi-aspartate site mutant. 39 and 70% for the mutant at both sites in the absence of salt. The active site mutant requires relatively low 40 concentration ($0.5 M) of salt for folding. These results suggest that suppression of negative charge 41 repulsion at both active and bi-aspartate sites by salt is necessary to yield a folded protein. 42 Ó 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.,True,wKV2osIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6554363290934525703&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Biodiversitas 20: 3042-3048. Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense is one of the major causative bacterial pathogens of the soft rot disease in various crops. It has a high virulence and a wide range of hosts in the tropics and the subtropics. Most often. conventional methods are not able to accurately distinguish P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense from other subspecies. Thus. this study aimed to design a specific gyrase B gene (gyrB)-based primers for the detection and identification of soft rot pathogen. The specific primers design was based on the alignment using gyrB gene sequence data from P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense and other data from the GenBank. The primers comprised of F-gyr-Pcb (5’-CAC AGG CAC CGC TGG CTG TT-3’) and R-gyr-Pcb (5’-CGT CGT TCC ACT GCA ATG CCA-3’) with an amplicon of 336 base pairs. The specificity of the primers pair was verified both in silico and in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. where the primers could only detect P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense. Primers’ sensitivity was determined by qualitative PCR with a detection limit of less than 0.5 ng/µL of genomic DNA.

Produk alum terdiri dari 5 produk alum work in process (WIP). dan 18 produk alum finished goods (FG). Perencanaan produksi yang dilakukan pada PT Liku Telaga masih menggunakan metode sederhana (trial and error). karena hanya berusaha memenuhi seluruh permintaan alum tanpa memperhatikan ketersediaan sumberdaya perusahaan. Akibatnya. terjadi beberapa masalah pada proses produksi alum. mulai dari kapasitas produksi yang rendah sehingga permintaan alum tidak terpenuhi seluruhnya. penumpukan inventory alum WIP melebihi kapasitas maksimal. biaya produksi dan inventory yang cukup tinggi. serta waktu setup mesin yang melebihi alokasi waktu maksimal. Oleh karena itu dibutuhkan perencanaan produksi yang optimal. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengoptimalkan perencanaan produksi alum pada PT Liku Telaga dengan metode goal programming. sehingga dapat memaksimalkan kapasitas produksi untuk memenuhi seluruh permintaan alum. meminimalkan inventory alum WIP. meminimalkan biaya produksi dan inventory. serta meminimalkan waktu setup mesin.

This protein protects cell from the deleterious effects of various stress condition by two mechanism. chaperone and protease. The expression of DegP is upregulated in response to various stress conditions. Halophilic microbes live at high salt concentration. This condition allows damage in protein cellular. To prevent the damage. halophilic microbes was predicted to produce protease DegP. In this research we cloned. expressed and in silico analyzed the physicochemical properties of putative DegP from Halomonas sp. BKL-5 for further analysis about DegP in halophilic bacteria. The gene encoded putative DegP from Halomonas sp. BKL-5 was isolated using primers which were design from mature domain of DegP from Chromohalobacter salexigens DSM 3043. Analysis of nucleotide sequence showed open reading frame of the gene consists of 1356 bp. with ATG as start codon and TGA as stop codon. The deduced amino acid of the gene has 99% similarity to DegP from Chromohalobacter salexigen DSM 3043. Expression of recombinant putative DegP from Halomonas sp BKL-5 obtains protein band at position 49 kDa. Based on solubility analysis. this recombinant protein produced in soluble form. Generally. putative DegP from Halomonas sp. BKL-5 has characteristic as similar as halophilic protein.

Exocytosis of sperm's single vesicle—the acrosome—is a synchronized. all-or-nothing process that happens only once in the life of the cell and depends on activation of both the GTP-binding protein Rab3 and of neurotoxin-sensitive SNAREs. These characteristics make acrosomal exocytosis a unique mammalian model for the study of the different phases of the membrane fusion cascade. By using a functional assay and immunofluorescence techniques in combination with neurotoxins and a photosensitive Ca2+ chelator we show that. in unactivated sperm. SNAREs are locked in heterotrimeric cis complexes. Upon Ca2+ entry into the cytoplasm. Rab3 is activated and triggers NSF/α-SNAP-dependent disassembly of cis SNARE complexes. Monomeric SNAREs in the plasma membrane and the outer acrosomal membrane are then free to reassemble in loose trans complexes that are resistant to NSF/α-SNAP and differentially sensitive to cleavage by two vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)–specific neurotoxins. Ca2+ must be released from inside the acrosome to trigger the final steps of membrane fusion that require fully assembled trans SNARE complexes and synaptotagmin. Our results indicate that the unidirectional and sequential disassembly and assembly of SNARE complexes drive acrosomal exocytosis.,True,wuk-FsgAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,136,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030323,5713677976442293222,/scholar?cites=5713677976442293222,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030323,0,0,0

The single secretory granule of the sperm fuses at multiple points with the overlying plasma membrane. In the past few years we have characterized several aspects of this process using streptolysin O-permeabilized human spermatozoa. Here we show that Rab3A triggers acrosomal exocytosis in the virtual absence of calcium in the cytosolic compartment. Interestingly. exocytosis is blocked when calcium is depleted from intracellular stores. By using a membrane-permeant fluorescent calcium probe. we observed that the acrosome actually behaves as a calcium store. Depleting calcium from this compartment by using a light-sensitive chelator prevents secretion promoted by Rab3A. UV inactivation of the chelator restores exocytosis.

Many intracellular and extracellular proteins consist. in part or fully. of combinations of protein modules. C2-domains. together with SH2. PTB. PH. SH3. WW. and PDZ domains. are typical examples of intracellular protein modules. These modules form independently folding domains of 80–160 residues with characteristic binding properties; C2-domains bind Ca2+ and phospholipids. SH2 and PTB domains phosphotyrosine-containing sequences. PH domains phosphatidylinositol phosphates. SH3 and WW domains proline-rich sequences. and PDZ domains C-terminal sequences. C2-domains are unique among these modules because phospholipid binding to many C2-domains is regulated by Ca2+. For this reason. C2-domains are sometimes referred to as Ca2+-dependent lipid binding domains. However. C2-domains are not obligatory Ca2+-and phospholipid-binding modules. C2-domains have diverged evolutionarily into Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent forms that interact with multiple targets.

Control of this conformational transition is important for brain function. but the underlying mechanism is unknown. NMR and fluorescence experiments now show that the Munc13-1 MUN domain. which plays a central role in vesicle priming. markedly accelerates the transition from the syntaxin-1–Munc18-1 complex to the SNARE complex. This activity depends on weak interactions of the MUN domain with the syntaxin-1 SNARE motif. and probably with Munc18-1.

Ca 2+-dependent phospholipid binding is key for synaptotagmin function. but it is unclear how this activity cooperates with the SNARE complex involved in release or why Ca 2+ binding to the C 2 B domain is more crucial for release than Ca 2+ binding to the C 2 A domain. Here we show that Ca 2+ induces high-affinity simultaneous binding of synaptotagmin to two membranes. bringing them into close proximity. The synaptotagmin C 2 B domain is sufficient for this ability. which arises from the abundance of basic residues around its surface. We propose a model wherein synaptotagmin cooperates with the SNAREs in bringing the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes together and accelerates membrane fusion through the highly positive electrostatic potential of its C 2 B domain.,True,GeTB7ZoAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,276,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb1056,8425255368838177250,/scholar?cites=8425255368838177250,,,0,0,0

In primary ER+ (estrogen receptor–positive)/PR+ human tumors. we report that PR reprograms estrogen signaling as a genomic agonist and a phenotypic antagonist. In isolation. estrogen and progestin act as genomic agonists by regulating the expression of common target genes in similar directions. but at different levels. Similarly. in isolation. progestin is also a weak phenotypic agonist of estrogen action. However. in the presence of both hormones. progestin behaves as a phenotypic estrogen antagonist.

It is considered a specialized mode of membrane trafficking that is achieved by docking and fusion of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane (ie. exocytosis). Secretory vesicle traffic is thought to be regulated by a family of Rab small GTPases. which are regulators of membrane traffic that are common to all eukaryotic cells. Classically. mammalian Rab3 subfamily members were thought to be critical regulators of secretory vesicle exocytosis in neurons and endocrine cells. but recent genetic and proteomic studies indicate that Rab3 is not the sole Rab isoform that regulates secretory vesicle traffic.

An important component of insulin-regulated GLUT4 distribution is the Akt substrate AS160 rab GTPase-activating protein. Here we show that Rab10 functions as a downstream target of AS160 in the insulin-signaling pathway that regulates GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes. Overexpression of a mutant of Rab10 defective for GTP hydrolysis increased GLUT4 on the surface of basal adipocytes. Rab10 knockdown resulted in an attenuation of insulin-induced GLUT4 redistribution to the plasma membrane and a concomitant 2-fold decrease in GLUT4 exocytosis rate. Re-expression of a wild-type Rab10 restored normal GLUT4 translocation. The basal increase in plasma-membrane GLUT4 due to AS160 knockdown was partially blocked by knocking down Rab10 in the same cells. further indicating that Rab10 is a target of AS160 …,True,O5d7nY8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,328,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413107000629,1755156910788513705,/scholar?cites=1755156910788513705,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413107000629,0,0,0

Mutations to this homodimeric flavoprotein cause the often-fatal human disease known as E3 deficiency. To catalyze the oxidation of dihydrolipoamide. hE3 uses two molecules: non-covalently bound FAD and a transiently bound substrate. NAD+. To address the catalytic mechanism of hE3 and the structural basis for E3 deficiency. the crystal structures of hE3 in the presence of NAD+ or NADH have been determined at resolutions of 2.5 Å and 2.1 Å. respectively. Although the overall fold of the enzyme is similar to that of yeast E3. these two structures differ at two loops that protrude from the proteins and at their FAD-binding sites.

We report here the structure of the TOG2 domain from Stu2p bound to yeast αβ-tubulin. Like TOG1. TOG2 binds selectively to a fully ‘curved’ conformation of αβ-tubulin. incompatible with a microtubule lattice. We also show that TOG1-TOG2 binds non-cooperatively to two αβ-tubulins. Preferential interactions between TOGs and fully curved αβ-tubulin that cannot exist elsewhere in the microtubule explain how these polymerases localize to the extreme microtubule end. We propose that these polymerases promote elongation because their linked TOG domains concentrate unpolymerized αβ-tubulin near curved subunits already bound at the microtubule end.

This review will describe the organization of each compartment and then discuss their alignment across pre- and postsynaptic cells at a nanometer scale.

Ltd,α‐RIMs (RIM1α and RIM2α) are multidomain active zone proteins of presynaptic terminals. α‐RIMs bind to Rab3 on synaptic vesicles and to Munc13 on the active zone via their N‐terminal region. and interact with other synaptic proteins via their central and C‐terminal regions. Although RIM1α has been well characterized. nothing is known about the function of RIM2α. We now show that RIM1α and RIM2α are expressed in overlapping but distinct patterns throughout the brain. To examine and compare their functions. we generated knockout mice lacking RIM2α. and crossed them with previously produced RIM1α knockout mice. We found that deletion of either RIM1α or RIM2α is not lethal. but ablation of both α‐RIMs causes postnatal death. This lethality is not due to a loss of synapse structure or a developmental change. but to a defect in neurotransmitter release.

1189616,The readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles,2017,Pascal S Kaeser and Wade G Regehr,43,,,63-70,Elsevier Current Trends,Each presynaptic bouton is densely packed with many vesicles. only a small fraction of which are available for immediate release. These vesicles constitute the readily releasable pool (RRP). The RRP size. and the probability of release of each vesicle within the RRP. together determine synaptic strength. Here. we discuss complications and recent advances in determining the size of the physiologically relevant RRP. We consider molecular mechanisms to generate and regulate the RRP. and discuss the relationship between vesicle docking and the RRP. We conclude that many RRP vesicles are docked. that some docked vesicles may not be part of the RRP. and that undocked vesicles can contribute to the RRP by rapid recruitment to unoccupied. molecularly activated ready-to-release sites.,True,oXO_MA8AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,96,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438817300041,405481194628060962,/scholar?cites=405481194628060962,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5447466/,0,0,0

Doc2 proteins bound to N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) complexes in competition with synaptotagmin-1. Thus. different classes of multiple C2 domain–containing molecules trigger synchronous versus spontaneous fusion. which suggests a general mechanism for synaptic vesicle fusion triggered by the combined …,True,tUHw5JIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,285,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5973/1614.abstract,106278808505037069,/scholar?cites=106278808505037069,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846320/,0,0,0

The coupling between incoming action potentials and neurotransmitter secretion is modulated by firstly. recent activity of the presynaptic axon that leads to the accumulation of residual calcium in the terminal and secondly. activation of presynaptic receptors by external signals. Despite the detailed description of these phenomena. the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood.

We also found that >100 presynaptic proteins are phosphorylated and may contribute to the translation of presynaptic receptor activation to secretion modulation.

Despite their highly conserved carbohydrate binding motifs with essentially identical structures. their affinities for lactose. a common galectin inhibitor. vary significantly. Here. we aimed to examine the molecular basis of differential lactose affinities amongst galectins using solution-based techniques. Consistent dissociation constants of lactose binding were derived from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. isothermal titration calorimetry and bio-layer interferometry for human galectin-1 (hGal1). galectin-7 (hGal7). and the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of galectin-8 (hGal8 NTD and hGal8 CTD. respectively). Furthermore. the dissociation rates of lactose binding were extracted from NMR lineshape analyses. Structural mapping of chemical shift perturbations revealed long-range perturbations upon lactose binding for hGal1 and hGal8 NTD. We further demonstrated using the NMR-based hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) that lactose binding increases the exchange rates of residues located on the opposite side of the ligand-binding pocket for hGal1 and hGal8 NTD. indicative of allostery. Additionally. lactose binding induces significant stabilisation of hGal8 CTD across the entire domain. Our results suggested that lactose binding reduced the internal dynamics of hGal8 CTD on a very slow timescale (minutes and slower) at the expense of reduced binding affinity due to the unfavourable loss of conformational entropy.

The HypBA1 exerts exo-glycosidase activity to hydrolyze β-1. 2-linked arabinofuranose disaccharides from non-reducing end into individual L-arabinoses. In this study. the crystal structures of HypBA1 and its complex with L-arabinose and Zn2+ ion were determined at 2.23-2.78 Å resolution. HypBA1 consists of three domains. denoted N-. S-and C-domain. The N-domain (residues 1-5 and 434-538) and C-domain (residues 539-658) adopt β-jellyroll architectures. and the S-domain (residues 6-433) adopts an (α/α) 6-barrel fold. HypBA1 utilizes the S-and C-domain to form a functional dimer. The complex structure suggests that the catalytic core lies in the S-domain where Cys417 and Glu322 serve as nucleophile and general acid/base. respectively. to cleave the glycosidic bonds via a retaining mechanism. The enzyme contains a restricted carbohydrate-binding cleft. which accommodates shorter arabino oligosaccharides exclusively. In addition to the complex crystal structures. we have one more interesting crystal which contains the apo HypBA1 structure without Zn2+ ion. In this structure. the Cys417-containing loop is shifted away due to the disappearance of all coordinate bonds in the absence of Zn2+ ion.

Upon binding to 14-3-3. the stability. subcellular localization and/or catalytic activity of the ligands are modified. Seven paralogs are strictly conserved in mammalian species. Although initially thought as redundant. the number of studies showing specialization is growing. We created a protein-protein interaction network for 14-3-3. kinases and their substrates signaling in human cells. We included information of phosphorylation. acetylation and other PTM sites. obtaining a complete representation of the 14-3-3 binding partners and their modifications. Using a computational system approach we found that networks of each 14-3-3 isoform are statistically different. It was remarkable to find that Tyr was the most phosphorylatable amino acid in domains of 14-3-3 epsilon partners. This. together with the over-representation of SH3 and Tyr_Kinase domains. suggest that epsilon could be involved in growth factors receptors signaling pathways particularly. We also found that within zeta’s network. the number of acetylated partners (and the number of modify lysines) is significantly higher compared with each of the other isoforms. Our results imply previously unreported hidden differences of the 14-3-3 isoforms interaction networks.

Because non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NP-Ga3PDHase) is involved in the production of reductive power (NADPH) in the cytosol. its behavior under oxidative stress conditions was analyzed. The specific activity of the enzyme was found to increase up to 2-fold after oxidative conditions imposed by methylviologen in wheat and maize seedlings. Under moderate oxidant concentration. lack of mRNA induction was observed. The increase in specific activity would thus be a consequence of a significant stability of NP-Ga3PDHase.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,This article proposes the design of tunable dual‐band filters for multiband multistandard systems. specifically for wireless local‐area network applications. The two main goals are to provide frequency tunability in the second band while maintaining the first band fixed and to obtain a structure capable of offering a ratio between the second and first passband center frequencies larger than 2. To this end. a capacitively loaded stepped‐impedance resonator is proposed for integration in dual‐band filters. A detailed analysis of the resonator is provided. A filter has been designed to validate the concept. It demonstrates operability in wireless local‐area network frequency bands. with a fixed first band at 2.45 GHz and a second band which can be tuned between 5.75 GHz and 5.25 GHz. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals.

In most cells the activity of NSF is constitutive. but in Jurkat cells and sperm it is repressed by tyrosine phosphorylation; the phosphomimetic mutant NSF–Y83E inhibits secretion in the former. The questions addressed here are if and how the NSF mutant influences the configuration of the SNARE complex.

These experiments demonstrate that topical application of UV‐irradiated urocanic acid systemically suppresses the contact type hypersensitivity response to oxazolone in hairless mice. In addition. topically applied urocanic acid markedly increases the overt tumour yield and the degree of malignancy in hairless mice exposed chronically to daily minimally erythema] doses of simulated solar UV light.

The koala was used as a natural biological sampler in an attempt to understand the dynamics of C. neoformans var. gattii in Australian environments. Evidence of asymptomatic nasal and skin colonization for extended periods by large numbers of C. n. var. gattii was obtained and geographical factors assessed. The key finding was the ability of koalas to amplify numbers of C. n. var. gattii in certain environments. Koalas were not found to be obligatory for the survival of the organism in all environments. Geographical factors alone could not explain differing rates of nasal and skin colonization in koalas in different environments.

Lunney and P. Hutchings.) pp,,150-168,,Koalas are prime candidates to study the impact of climate change because they are specialised folivores and lack any ready means of avoiding weather extremes. Koalas are widely but patchily distributed throughout eastern mainland Australia. Efforts to protect them from landscape-scale threats have been identified in the NSW 2008 Koala Recovery Plan. the 2010 NSW Priorities for biodiversity adaptation to climate change and the 2009-14 National Koala Conservation and Management Strategy. The statements in the formal strategies and recovery plans identify a number of problems. two of which we address in this paper. The first problem is that of extreme weather and the second is the change of leaf quality from rising levels of carbon dioxide. This paper capitalises on our field study in Gunnedah. in north-west NSW. which examined a 1990s success story where the local koala population benefited from the plantings of trees and shrubs to hold down the water table in the face ofa rising salinity crisis. In late 2009. heatwaves killed an estimated 25% of the Gunnedah koala population. This foreshadows how increased climate variability will impact on koala populations. In 2008. chlamydiosis–a disease causing infertility–had been established as being present in the Gunnedah population. The likely spread of this disease throughout the Gunnedah koala population presents a further challenge to wildlife managers in the context of a changing climate. The potential indirect effects of global climate change–how increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 may reduce the availability of the nutrients in Eucalyptus foliage to koalas–is described …,True,U6dgWEkAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,59,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=bG8bAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA150&dq=info:hn-pgiAzITQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=d7XoHmFImv&sig=5UXqph8_GEIL9fwyqwZlYnsPF-4,3756339778927820678,/scholar?cites=3756339778927820678,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46067486/Koalas_and_climate_change_a_case_study_o20160530-26114-y5sssd.pdf,0,0,0

Rattus rats are definitive hosts of A. cantonensis. while intermediate hosts include terrestrial and aquatic molluscs. Humans are dead-end hosts that usually become infected upon ingestion of infected molluscs. A presumptive diagnosis is often made based on clinical features. a history of mollusc consumption. eosinophilic pleocytosis in cerebral spinal fluid. and advanced imaging such as computed tomography. Serological tests are available for angiostrongyliasis. though many tests are still under development. While there is no treatment consensus. therapy often includes a combination of anthelmintics and corticosteroids. Angiostrongyliasis is relatively rare. but is often associated with morbidity and sometimes mortality. Recent reports suggest the parasites’ range is increasing. leading to fatalities in regions previously considered Angiostrongylus-free. and sometimes. delayed diagnosis in newly invaded regions. Increased awareness of angiostrongyliasis would facilitate rapid diagnosis and improved clinical outcomes.

METHODS: The RPE. with choroid attached. was wholemounted and stained with cresyl violet. From these preparations. the authors analyzed retinal area. RPE cell number. and cell density. RESULTS: Retinal pigment epithelial cell number is highly variable between persons but does not appear to be age related. Retinal area increases until approximately 30 years of age. but beyond this age individual variation masks further enlargement. The distinctive topography of the RPE changes markedly with age. There is a modification from the relatively homogeneous cell density distribution in the youngest retinas examined toward a more heterogeneous pattern in older retinas. From mid-adolescence. a band of larger cells appears at the extreme periphery. adjacent to the ora serrata. which gradually widens so that by 90 years of age. it occupies the outermost 30% of the retinal area. Cell density is highest in the central temporal retina. adjacent to the macula in the neural retina. throughout life. Cell density values in this region increase slightly with age. and the difference between this and surrounding regions becomes more marked with age.

A review of assessment methods and empirical results,2017,PW Bateman and PA Fleming,211,Biological Conservation,,10-19,,There is a general assumption that animal species that face anthropogenic disturbance through tourism suffer some negative impacts as a result.

This theory should apply even when organisms are habituated to disturbance. and how animals respond to human presence is likely to determine their success exploiting urban habitats. Therefore. urban animals should be sensitive to cues that inform them about levels of risk. allowing them to reduce costs by not overreacting to innocuous stimuli. while ensuring that they are nevertheless reactive to genuinely threatening stimuli. We tested this at a highly urbanized site in New York City. where eastern grey squirrels appear to pay little attention to humans.

1189839,Beak and feather disease virus infection in cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus),2008,Patrick L Shearer and Nicolai Bonne and Phillip Clark and Margaret Sharp and Shane R Raidal,37,Avian pathology,1,75-81,Taylor & Francis Group,Psittacine beak and feather disease is known to occur in a wide range of psittacine species; however. there are no scientific or credible anecdotal reports of psittacine beak and feather disease occurring in the cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) despite it being one of the world's most commonly kept companion bird species. Consequently. this has resulted in speculation that the species may have some innate resistance to beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) infection. To investigate this hypothesis we conducted a survey of cockatiels (n=88) at commercial aviaries to investigate whether BFDV infection occurs in cockatiels. and found that all birds were virus-free by polymerase chain reaction and haemagglutination assay and had no detectable antibody titre by haemagglutination-inhibition assay.

Ltd,The suitability of PCR (based on the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene) for use as a diagnostic test for the detection of Campylobacter spp. in human faecal specimens was assessed. A total of 493 faecal specimens from patients with symptoms of enteritis were tested for the presence of campylobacters using PCR. Results were compared with those obtained from the analyses of the same specimens by culture techniques. using χ2 square with Fisher’s exact test. PCR was found to detect significantly more positive specimens than culture (χ2 = 200·086 ; P < 0·0001). The sensitivity and specificity of PCR when compared with the culture technique were found to be 91 and 97%. respectively.

1189896,Parasite vaccines: the new generation,2007,Andrea Crampton and Thiru Vanniasinkam,7,,5,664-673,Elsevier,Parasites cause some of the most devastating and prevalent diseases in humans and animals. Moreover. parasitic infections increase mortality rates of other serious non-parasitic infections caused by pathogens such as HIV-1. The impact of parasitic diseases in both industrialised and developing countries is further exacerbated by the resistance of some parasites to anti-parasitic drugs and the absence of efficacious parasite vaccines. Despite years of research. much remains to be done to develop effective vaccines against parasites. This review focuses on the more recent vaccine strategies such as DNA and viral vector-based vaccines that are currently being used to develop vaccines against parasites.

The only option to stem this epidemic is through inexpensive and efficacious vaccines that prevent or at least blunt HIV-1 infections. Despite decades of pre-clinical and clinical research such vaccines remain elusive. Most anti-viral vaccines act by inducing protective levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies. The envelope protein of HIV-1. the sole target of neutralizing antibodies. is constantly changing due to mutations.

Some studies have demonstrated that the potency of viral promoters does not necessarily correlate with DNA vaccine efficacy in vivo. This has partly been attributed to downregulation of these promoters by cytokines such as interferon γ induced by the CpG motives of these vaccines. In an attempt to avoid downregulation of viral promoters by IFN-γ. we tested vaccine vectors driven by the MHC class II promoter. To enhance the activity of this promoter. another plasmid expressing the human MHC class II transactivator driven by a viral promoter. the native IFN-γ inducible CIITA type IV promoter (PIV) or a synthetic promoter containing IFN-γ inducible elements was co-inoculated.

Among Campylobacter spp. Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) and C. coli are the most common causes of human infection. In this study. a multiplex PCR (mPCR) and high resolution melt (HRM) curve analysis were optimized for simultaneous detection and differentiation of C. jejuni and C. coli isolates. A segment of the hippuricase gene (hipO) of C. jejuni and putative aspartokinase (asp) gene of C. coli were amplified from 26 Campylobacter isolates and amplicons were subjected to HRM curve analysis. The mPCR-HRM was able to differentiate between C. jejuni and C. coli species. All DNA amplicons generated by mPCR were sequenced. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences from each isolate revealed that the HRM curves were correlated with the nucleotide sequences of the amplicons. Minor variation in melting point temperatures of C. coli or C. jejuni isolates was also observed and enabled some intraspecies differentiation between C. coli and/or C. jejuni isolates.

In this study we tested 122 serum samples obtained from horses in New South Wales. Australia. using a standard serum neutralization (SN) assay and ELISA. Ninety-seven of the 122 sera displayed had moderate to high titers of antibodies to EAdV1 and/or EAdV2. Eighteen of the 122 sera were positive for both EAdV1 and EAdV2. In contrast. only thirty-seven positive samples were detected using the ELISA.

However there are still a significant number of veterinary diseases for which vaccines do not currently exist or where currently available vaccines do not provide adequate immunity. Adenoviruses have transitioned from tools for gene replacement therapy to bona fide vaccine delivery vehicles because of their ability to elicit potent cell-mediated and humoral responses making them ideal for use against viruses and other intracellular pathogens. Adenoviral vector based vaccines are likely to play a significant role in overcoming these problems in the future. However. this vector is under utilized in veterinary vaccine development at this time.

We agree that presence of a T at this polymorphic site is indeed a fairly good predictor of lactase persistence in …,True,-EpVb28AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC,264,https://gut.bmj.com/content/55/1/136.extract,11785787336462055220,/scholar?cites=11785787336462055220,,https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/55/1/136.full.pdf,0,0,0

Central America and New Zealand. Infected amphibians and contaminated water are implicated in translocation. but other vectors are unknown. Through in vitro studies we show that potential means of translocation may be moist soil and bird feathers. B. dendrobatidis survived for up to 3 mo in sterile. moist river sand with no other nutrients added. B. dendrobatidis attached to and grew on sterile feathers and were able to be transported by feathers to establish new cultures in media. surviving between 1 and 3 h of drying between transfers. If these in vitro results are valid in the natural environment. the findings raise the possibilities that B. dendrobatidis may be translocated by movement of moist river sand and that birds may carry the …,True,-EpVb28AAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC,253,https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v65/n3/p181-186/,9968989065523148896,/scholar?cites=9968989065523148896,,http://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2005/65/d065p181.pdf,0,0,0

Australia. has the highest rates of melanoma in the world and Queensland children have the greatest numbers of melanocytic naevi. the strongest risk factor for melanoma. Although both melanoma and naevi are broadly related to sun exposure in childhood. the relation to individual exposure early in life is difficult to study retrospectively in adults.We surveyed 506 children aged 1-6 years who had been born in Townsville. North Queensland. Sun exposure was assessed by questionnaire and melanocytic naevi were counted using a standard international protocol. Very high counts (upper quarter) of melanocytic naevi were significantly associated with sun exposure of more than 4 hours per day (adjusted relative risk ratio 3·29; 95% Cl 1·12-9·69). and with a history of sunburn (1·89; 1·11-3·21).

While the virulence of this disease has been clearly demonstrated. there is. as yet. no mechanistic explanation for how B. dendrobatidis kills amphibians. To investigate the pathology of chytridiomycosis. blood samples were collected from uninfected. aclinically infected and clinically diseased amphibians and analyzed for a wide range of biochemical and hematological parameters. Here. we show that green tree frogs Litoria caerulea with severe chytridiomycosis had reduced plasma osmolality. sodium. potassium. magnesium and chloride concentrations.

In a number of cases. it has been hypothesized that pathogens have caused species extinctions in wildlife. However. there is only one definitively proven case of extinction by infection. and this was in a remnant captive population of a Polynesian tree snail. In this article. we review the potential involvement of infectious disease in the recent extinction of the sharp-snouted day frog Taudactylus acutirostris. Our review of available evidence suggests that a virulent pathogen of amphibians. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. caused a rapid. catastrophic decline of this species. from which it did not recover.
