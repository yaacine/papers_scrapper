100072,Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition),2016,,12,Autophagy,1,1-222,,Many researchers. especially those new to the field. need to determine which criteria are essential for demonstrating autophagy. either for the purposes of their own research. or in the capacity of a manuscript or grant review. 1 Acceptable standards are an important issue. particularly considering that each of us may have his/her own opinion regarding the answer. Unfortunately. the answer is in part a “moving target” as the field evolves. 2 This can be extremely frustrating for researchers who may think they have met those criteria. only to find out that the reviewers of their papers have different ideas.

100079,Structural and functional aspects of papain-like cysteine proteinases and their protein inhibitors.,1997,Boris Turk and Vito Turk and Dušan Turk,378,,3-4,141-150,,Cysteine proteinases are widely distributed among living organisms. According to the most recent classifications (Rawlings and Barrett. 1993. 1994). they can be subdivided on the basis of sequence homology into 14 or even 20 different families. the most important being the papain and the calpain families. The papain-like cysteine proteinases are the most abundant among the cysteine proteinases. The family consists of papain and related plant proteinases such as chymopapain. caricain. bromelain. actinidin. ficin. and aleurain. and the lysosomal cathepsins B. H. L. S. C and K. Most of these enzymes are relatively small proteins with Mr values in the range 20000-35000 (reviewed in Brocklehurst et al.. 1987; Polgar. 1989; Rawlings and Barrett. 1994; Berti and Storer. 1995). with the exception of cathepsin C. which is an oligomeric enzyme with Mr approximately 200000 (Metrione et al.. 1970; Dolenc et al.. 1995). A number of cysteine proteinases are located within lysosomes. Four of them. cathepsins B. C. H and L. are ubiquitous in lysosomes of animals. whereas cathepsin S has a more restricted localisation (Barrett and Kirschke. 1981; Kirschke and Wiederanders. 1994).

100088,Protease signalling: the cutting edge,2012,Boris Turk and Dušan Turk and Vito Turk,31,,7,1630-1643,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd,Protease research has undergone a major expansion in the last decade. largely due to the extremely rapid development of new technologies. such as quantitative proteomics and in‐vivo imaging. as well as an extensive use of in‐vivo models. These have led to identification of physiological substrates and resulted in a paradigm shift from the concept of proteases as protein‐degrading enzymes to proteases as key signalling molecules. However. we are still at the beginning of an understanding of protease signalling pathways.

Ltd,Dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI) or cathepsin C is the physiological activator of groups of serine proteases from immune and inflammatory cells vital for defense of an organism. The structure presented shows how an additional domain transforms the framework of a papain-like endopeptidase into a robust oligomeric protease-processing enzyme. The tetrahedral arrangement of the active sites exposed to solvent allows approach of proteins in their native state; the massive body of the exclusion domain fastened within the tetrahedral framework excludes approach of a polypeptide chain apart from its termini; and the carboxylic group of Asp1 positions the N-terminal amino group of the substrate. Based on a structural comparison and interactions within the active site cleft. it is suggested that the exclusion domain originates from a metallo-protease inhibitor.

They are expressed throughout the animal and plant kingdoms as well as in viruses and bacteria. More recently. this protease family has drawn attention as a potential pharmaceutical drug target in diseases characterized by excessive extracellular matrix degradation such as in osteoporosis. arthritis. vascular diseases. and cancer. Moreover. papain-like cysteine proteases have been identified as critical components of the life cycle and invasive potential of various human and live stock pathogens as well as major allergens.

There is growing recognition that alternative proteolytic enzymes such as the lysosomal cathepsin proteases can initiate or propagate proapoptotic signals. but it is currently unclear how cathepsins achieve these actions.

We have tested this hypothesis in vivo by breeding mice that lack cathepsin inhibition (cystatin B-deficient mice) to Bid-deficient mice. to determine whether the apoptosis caused by cathepsins is dependent on Bid signaling.

However. this view has dramatically changed. and cathepsins are now considered key players in many important physiological processes. including in diseases like cancer. rheumatoid arthritis. and various inflammatory diseases. Cathepsins are emerging as important players in the extracellular space. and the paradigm is shifting from the degrading enzymes to the enzymes that can also specifically modify extracellular proteins. In pathological conditions. the activity of cathepsins is often dysregulated. resulting in their overexpression and secretion into the extracellular space. This is typically observed in cancer and inflammation. and cathepsins are therefore considered valuable diagnostic and therapeutic targets. In particular. the investigation of limited proteolysis by cathepsins in the extracellular space is opening numerous possibilities for future break-through discoveries. In this review. we highlight the most important findings that establish cysteine cathepsins as important players in the extracellular space and discuss their roles that reach beyond processing and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components.

Some of them correlate with progression in a variety of cancers and therefore are considered as potential therapeutic targets. Until recently. the contribution of individual cathepsins to tumorigenesis and tumor progression remained unknown. By crossing various types of mouse cancer models with mice where specific cathepsins have been ablated. we contributed to this gap of knowledge and will summarize the results in this report. The employed models are the Rip1-Tag2 model for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. the K14-HPV16 model for squamous skin and cervical cancers. and the MMTV-PyMT model for metastasizing breast cancer. the KPC model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. and the APCmin mice developing early stages of intestinal neoplasia. All models harbor mutations in relevant tumor suppressors and/or cell-type specific expression of potent oncogenes. which initiate de novo carcinogenesis in the targeted tissues. In all these models deletion of cathepsin B led to suppression of the aggressiveness of the respective cancer phenotype. Cathepsin B may network with other proteases as it was shown for cathepsin X/Z. In contrast. deletion of cathepsin L was beneficial in the RiP1-Tag2 model. but enhanced tumorigenesis in the APCmin. and the K14-HPV16 mice.

This change increases the rate of antithrombin inhibition of factor Xa. whereas acceleration of thrombin inhibition requires binding of both inhibitor and proteinase to the same heparin chain.

By contrast. binding of a second molecule of cathepsin H was much weaker. The 2:1 binding stoichiometry was confirmed by titration monitored by loss of enzyme activity and by sedimentation velocity experiments. The kinetics of binding of cathepsins L and S and papain showed the two proteinase binding sites to have association rate constants kass.

100167,Lysosomal Cysteine Proteases and Their Protein Inhibitors: Recent Developments.,2008,Vito Turk and Boris Turk,55,,4,,,With the completion of the human genome it has become evident that about 2% of all gene products are proteases. thereby being one of the largest groups of proteins. The general view on proteases as protein degrading enzymes has changed dramatically over the last few years and proteases are now seen as important signalling molecules that are involved in the regulation of numerous vital processes. Cysteine cathepsins occupy a special place as a group of papain-like cysteine proteases that are located predominantly in lysosomes. In addition to their role in intracellular protein turnover. they have essential roles in the immune response. protein processing. bone resorption and a number of other processes. Their activity is strictly regulated. largely through their interaction with their endogenous inhibitors cystatins and thyropins.

A major expansion in protease research has uncovered a variety of novel substrates. and it is now evident that proteases are critical pleiotropic actors orchestrating pathophysiological processes. Recent findings evidenced that the net proteolytic activity also relies upon interconnections between different protease and protease inhibitor families in the protease web.In this review. we provide an overview of these novel concepts with a particular focus on pulmonary pathophysiology. We describe the emerging roles of several protease families including cysteine and serine proteases.The complexity of the protease web is exemplified in the light of multidimensional regulation of serine protease activity by matrix metalloproteases through cognate serine protease inhibitor processing.

Over the last decade. proteases have become increasingly important clinical targets because many of their inhibitors are already used in the clinic or in various stages of clinical testing. Therefore. a better understanding of protease action and their repertoires of physiological substrates can not only provide an important insight into their mechanisms of action but also open a path toward novel drug design. Historically. proteases and their substrates were mainly studied on a case-by-case basis. but recent advancements in mass spectrometry-based proteomics have enabled proteolysis studies on a global scale.

The bacteria can be detected and monitored using bioluminescence or near-infrared fluorescence. Fluorescence imaging of bacteria was established by expressing the infrared fluorescent protein IRFP713 in Lactococcus lactis. Lactobacillus plantarum and Escherichia coli. All three bacterial species were monitored in live mice and no major differences in transit time were observed. Bacteria passed through the stomach and small intestine in 1 h and the majority were secreted from the large intestine after 6–8 h. Intestinal localization of bacteria was confirmed by imaging the isolated intestines and culturing the intestinal content. The use of fluorescence tomography for spatial localization of fluorescent bacteria has been established. The expression of an additional infrared fluorescent protein IRFP682 enabled concomitant detection of two bacterial populations in live mice.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Many human proteins contain amino acid repeats that can form homopolymeric amino acid (HPAA) tracts. HPAA tract proteins that contain polyalanine sequences promote diseases. including oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. The pathological properties of these proteins develop when the repeats match or exceed ∼20 residues. We analyzed the oligomerization of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and GST fusion proteins containing >20 alanine repeats by using sucrose density gradient centrifugation. YFP and GST fusion proteins having 23 polyalanine residues sedimented readily in sucrose density gradients. suggesting instability and oligomerization of proteins with an excess of 20 alanine repeats.

TNFα‐induced apoptosis proceeds through caspase‐8 activation. processing of the pro‐apoptotic molecule Bid. mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. and caspase‐3 activation. The translocation of lysosomal catD into the cytosol was a late event. suggesting that lysosomal membrane permeabilization and the release of cathepsins are not required for the induction of apoptosis. but rather amplifies the process through the generation of reactive oxygen species.

These tracers will translocate into the cytosol upon lysosomal membrane permeabilization and have the advantage of being detectable directly without additional labeling. Another benefit is that the tracers can be made more abundant than most endogenous lysosomal molecules. which facilitates their detection. Tracers that can be analyzed with fluorescence microscopy include low-molecular-mass molecules such as sulforhodamine B and also fluorescent polymers of dextran that are available in a wide range of molecular masses.

It was suggested that a key mechanism behind stefin B-mediated disease progression was impaired redox homeostasis. Stefin B-deficient mice were found more sensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis as a consequence of increased expression of caspase-11 and Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain. Leucine rich Repeat and Pyrin domain containing (NLRP nflammasome activation and higher levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present study. we investigated if LPS-triggered oxidative stress affected the protein levels and redox status of redox sensitive proteins—thioredoxin. peroxiredoxins. and superoxide dismutases in macrophages and spleens of LPS-injected mice. LPS challenge was found to result in a marked elevation in mitochondrial peroxiredoxin 3 (Prx3). sulfiredoxin. and superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) in stefin B-deficient macrophages and spleens. We determined that sulfiredoxin is targeted to mitochondria after LPS challenge.

100281,Mechanisms Applied by Protein Inhibitors to Inhibit Cysteine Proteases,2021,Livija Tušar and Aleksandra Usenik and Boris Turk and Dušan Turk,22,,3,997,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Protein inhibitors of proteases are an important tool of nature to regulate and control proteolysis in living organisms under physiological and pathological conditions. In this review. we analyzed the mechanisms of inhibition of cysteine proteases on the basis of structural information and compiled kinetic data. The gathered structural data indicate that the protein fold is not a major obstacle for the evolution of a protease inhibitor. It appears that nature can convert almost any starting fold into an inhibitor of a protease. In addition. there appears to be no general rule governing the inhibitory mechanism. The structural data make it clear that the “lock and key” mechanism is a historical concept with limited validity. However. the analysis suggests that the shape of the active site cleft of proteases imposes some restraints. When the S1 binding site is shaped as a pocket buried in the structure of protease. inhibitors can apply substrate-like binding mechanisms. In contrast. when the S1 binding site is in part exposed to solvent. the substrate-like inhibition cannot be employed. It appears that all proteases. with the exception of papain-like proteases. belong to the first group of proteases. Finally. we show a number of examples and provide hints on how to engineer protein inhibitors.,True,bgnNobAAAAAJ:jmjb1lOE9QIC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/966908,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/3/997/pdf,0,0,0

Applications of nanomaterials that can dysregulate tumormicroenvironment are emerging as a promising anti-cancer approaches. which can improve the efficacy of existing cancer treatments. We have reported that agglomerates of radially assembled Al hydroxide crumpled nanosheets with the disordered defective surface structure have a large positive charge and therefore can lead to ion imbalance at the cell perimembranous space through the selective adsorption of extracellular anionic species. This effect was demonstrated in vitro by reduced viability and proliferation of tumor cells. and further validated in a murine melanoma cancer model. Furthermore. crumpled Al hydroxide nanostructures showed a much stronger suppressive effect on tumor growth in combination with a minimally effective dose of doxorubicin.

EMT is activated and regulated by specific microenvironmental endogenous triggers and a complex network of signalling pathways. These mostly include epigenetic events that affect protein translation-controlling factors and proteases. altogether orchestrated by the switching on and off of oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes in cancer cells. The hallmark of cancer-linked EMT is that the process is incomplete. as it is opposed by the reverse process of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. which results in a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype that shows notable cell plasticity. This is a characteristic of cancer stem cells (CSCs). and it is of the utmost importance in their niche …,True,bgnNobAAAAAJ:TaaCk18tZOkC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488920301403,,,,,0,0,0

HRgpA and RgpB gingipains have Arg-specificity. while Kgp gingipain is Lys-specific. Together they can cleave an array of proteins and importantly contribute to the development of periodontitis. In this study we focused on gingipain-exerted proteolysis at the cell surface of human gingival epithelial cells (telomerase immortalized gingival keratinocytes [TIGK]) in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms behind tissue destruction in periodontitis. Using mass spectrometry. we investigated the whole sheddome/degradome of TIGK cell surface proteins by P. gingivalis strains differing in gingipain expression and by purified gingipains. and performed the first global proteomic analysis of gingipain membrane proteolysis. Incubation of TIGK cells with P. gingivalis resulted in massive degradation of proteins already at low multiplicity of infection. whereas incubating cells with purified gingipains resulted in more discrete patterns. indicative of a combination of complete degradation and shedding of membrane proteins. Most of the identified gingipain substrates were molecules involved in adhesion. suggesting that gingipains may cause tissue damage through cleavage of cell contacts. resulting in cell detachment and rounding. and consequently leading to anoikis. However. HRgpA and RgpB gingipains differ in their mechanism of action. While RgpB rapidly degraded the proteins. HRgpA exhibited a much slower proteolysis indicative of ectodomain shedding. as demonstrated for the transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC).

Among newly developed biomedical strategies. nanoparticles have been widely exploited in cancer therapy because of their unique physical and chemical properties. One of the newly emerging areas for potential nanoparticle applications in cancer therapy is based on the fact that cancer cells are particularly sensitive to the changes in intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations1. Therefore. nanostructures of inorganic materials that affect ion concentrations due to their surface charge and/or adsorption properties2 could represent a novel strategy for anticancer therapy. In this respect. the nanostructured boehmite form of aluminum hydroxide seems especially attractive due to its unique combination of an extremely large specific surface area and positive surface charge3. In addition. Al hydroxide is approved for clinical applications and has been used as a human vaccine adjuvant over six decades. with a demonstrated safety profile4.
