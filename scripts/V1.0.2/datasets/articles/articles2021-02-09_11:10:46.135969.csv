100072,Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition),2016,,12,Autophagy,1,1-222,,Many researchers. especially those new to the field. need to determine which criteria are essential for demonstrating autophagy. either for the purposes of their own research. or in the capacity of a manuscript or grant review. 1 Acceptable standards are an important issue. particularly considering that each of us may have his/her own opinion regarding the answer. Unfortunately. the answer is in part a “moving target” as the field evolves. 2 This can be extremely frustrating for researchers who may think they have met those criteria. only to find out that the reviewers of their papers have different ideas.

100079,Structural and functional aspects of papain-like cysteine proteinases and their protein inhibitors.,1997,Boris Turk and Vito Turk and Dušan Turk,378,,3-4,141-150,,Cysteine proteinases are widely distributed among living organisms. According to the most recent classifications (Rawlings and Barrett. 1993. 1994). they can be subdivided on the basis of sequence homology into 14 or even 20 different families. the most important being the papain and the calpain families. The papain-like cysteine proteinases are the most abundant among the cysteine proteinases. The family consists of papain and related plant proteinases such as chymopapain. caricain. bromelain. actinidin. ficin. and aleurain. and the lysosomal cathepsins B. H. L. S. C and K. Most of these enzymes are relatively small proteins with Mr values in the range 20000-35000 (reviewed in Brocklehurst et al.. 1987; Polgar. 1989; Rawlings and Barrett. 1994; Berti and Storer. 1995). with the exception of cathepsin C. which is an oligomeric enzyme with Mr approximately 200000 (Metrione et al.. 1970; Dolenc et al.. 1995). A number of cysteine proteinases are located within lysosomes. Four of them. cathepsins B. C. H and L. are ubiquitous in lysosomes of animals. whereas cathepsin S has a more restricted localisation (Barrett and Kirschke. 1981; Kirschke and Wiederanders. 1994).

100088,Protease signalling: the cutting edge,2012,Boris Turk and Dušan Turk and Vito Turk,31,,7,1630-1643,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd,Protease research has undergone a major expansion in the last decade. largely due to the extremely rapid development of new technologies. such as quantitative proteomics and in‐vivo imaging. as well as an extensive use of in‐vivo models. These have led to identification of physiological substrates and resulted in a paradigm shift from the concept of proteases as protein‐degrading enzymes to proteases as key signalling molecules. However. we are still at the beginning of an understanding of protease signalling pathways.

Ltd,Dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI) or cathepsin C is the physiological activator of groups of serine proteases from immune and inflammatory cells vital for defense of an organism. The structure presented shows how an additional domain transforms the framework of a papain-like endopeptidase into a robust oligomeric protease-processing enzyme. The tetrahedral arrangement of the active sites exposed to solvent allows approach of proteins in their native state; the massive body of the exclusion domain fastened within the tetrahedral framework excludes approach of a polypeptide chain apart from its termini; and the carboxylic group of Asp1 positions the N-terminal amino group of the substrate. Based on a structural comparison and interactions within the active site cleft. it is suggested that the exclusion domain originates from a metallo-protease inhibitor.

They are expressed throughout the animal and plant kingdoms as well as in viruses and bacteria. More recently. this protease family has drawn attention as a potential pharmaceutical drug target in diseases characterized by excessive extracellular matrix degradation such as in osteoporosis. arthritis. vascular diseases. and cancer. Moreover. papain-like cysteine proteases have been identified as critical components of the life cycle and invasive potential of various human and live stock pathogens as well as major allergens.

There is growing recognition that alternative proteolytic enzymes such as the lysosomal cathepsin proteases can initiate or propagate proapoptotic signals. but it is currently unclear how cathepsins achieve these actions.

We have tested this hypothesis in vivo by breeding mice that lack cathepsin inhibition (cystatin B-deficient mice) to Bid-deficient mice. to determine whether the apoptosis caused by cathepsins is dependent on Bid signaling.

However. this view has dramatically changed. and cathepsins are now considered key players in many important physiological processes. including in diseases like cancer. rheumatoid arthritis. and various inflammatory diseases. Cathepsins are emerging as important players in the extracellular space. and the paradigm is shifting from the degrading enzymes to the enzymes that can also specifically modify extracellular proteins. In pathological conditions. the activity of cathepsins is often dysregulated. resulting in their overexpression and secretion into the extracellular space. This is typically observed in cancer and inflammation. and cathepsins are therefore considered valuable diagnostic and therapeutic targets. In particular. the investigation of limited proteolysis by cathepsins in the extracellular space is opening numerous possibilities for future break-through discoveries. In this review. we highlight the most important findings that establish cysteine cathepsins as important players in the extracellular space and discuss their roles that reach beyond processing and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components.

Some of them correlate with progression in a variety of cancers and therefore are considered as potential therapeutic targets. Until recently. the contribution of individual cathepsins to tumorigenesis and tumor progression remained unknown. By crossing various types of mouse cancer models with mice where specific cathepsins have been ablated. we contributed to this gap of knowledge and will summarize the results in this report. The employed models are the Rip1-Tag2 model for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. the K14-HPV16 model for squamous skin and cervical cancers. and the MMTV-PyMT model for metastasizing breast cancer. the KPC model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. and the APCmin mice developing early stages of intestinal neoplasia. All models harbor mutations in relevant tumor suppressors and/or cell-type specific expression of potent oncogenes. which initiate de novo carcinogenesis in the targeted tissues. In all these models deletion of cathepsin B led to suppression of the aggressiveness of the respective cancer phenotype. Cathepsin B may network with other proteases as it was shown for cathepsin X/Z. In contrast. deletion of cathepsin L was beneficial in the RiP1-Tag2 model. but enhanced tumorigenesis in the APCmin. and the K14-HPV16 mice.

This change increases the rate of antithrombin inhibition of factor Xa. whereas acceleration of thrombin inhibition requires binding of both inhibitor and proteinase to the same heparin chain.

By contrast. binding of a second molecule of cathepsin H was much weaker. The 2:1 binding stoichiometry was confirmed by titration monitored by loss of enzyme activity and by sedimentation velocity experiments. The kinetics of binding of cathepsins L and S and papain showed the two proteinase binding sites to have association rate constants kass.

100167,Lysosomal Cysteine Proteases and Their Protein Inhibitors: Recent Developments.,2008,Vito Turk and Boris Turk,55,,4,,,With the completion of the human genome it has become evident that about 2% of all gene products are proteases. thereby being one of the largest groups of proteins. The general view on proteases as protein degrading enzymes has changed dramatically over the last few years and proteases are now seen as important signalling molecules that are involved in the regulation of numerous vital processes. Cysteine cathepsins occupy a special place as a group of papain-like cysteine proteases that are located predominantly in lysosomes. In addition to their role in intracellular protein turnover. they have essential roles in the immune response. protein processing. bone resorption and a number of other processes. Their activity is strictly regulated. largely through their interaction with their endogenous inhibitors cystatins and thyropins.

A major expansion in protease research has uncovered a variety of novel substrates. and it is now evident that proteases are critical pleiotropic actors orchestrating pathophysiological processes. Recent findings evidenced that the net proteolytic activity also relies upon interconnections between different protease and protease inhibitor families in the protease web.In this review. we provide an overview of these novel concepts with a particular focus on pulmonary pathophysiology. We describe the emerging roles of several protease families including cysteine and serine proteases.The complexity of the protease web is exemplified in the light of multidimensional regulation of serine protease activity by matrix metalloproteases through cognate serine protease inhibitor processing.

Berlin/New York,The complete amino acid sequence of the inhibitor of cysteine proteinases from pineapple stem acetone powder was determined. The inhibitor consists of 52 amino acids and is composed of two polypeptide chains (41 and 11 amino acids) linked via disulphide bonds. It differs from already known sequences in one to four amino acids. Data from its amino acid sequence analysis clearly show that this inhibitor cannot be a member of the cystatin superfamily.

Over the last decade. proteases have become increasingly important clinical targets because many of their inhibitors are already used in the clinic or in various stages of clinical testing. Therefore. a better understanding of protease action and their repertoires of physiological substrates can not only provide an important insight into their mechanisms of action but also open a path toward novel drug design. Historically. proteases and their substrates were mainly studied on a case-by-case basis. but recent advancements in mass spectrometry-based proteomics have enabled proteolysis studies on a global scale.

The bacteria can be detected and monitored using bioluminescence or near-infrared fluorescence. Fluorescence imaging of bacteria was established by expressing the infrared fluorescent protein IRFP713 in Lactococcus lactis. Lactobacillus plantarum and Escherichia coli. All three bacterial species were monitored in live mice and no major differences in transit time were observed. Bacteria passed through the stomach and small intestine in 1 h and the majority were secreted from the large intestine after 6–8 h. Intestinal localization of bacteria was confirmed by imaging the isolated intestines and culturing the intestinal content. The use of fluorescence tomography for spatial localization of fluorescent bacteria has been established. The expression of an additional infrared fluorescent protein IRFP682 enabled concomitant detection of two bacterial populations in live mice.
