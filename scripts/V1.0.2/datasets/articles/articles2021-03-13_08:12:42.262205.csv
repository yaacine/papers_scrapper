1155521,Shale gas correction to Klinkenberg slip theory,2012,Ebrahim Fathi and Ali Tinni and I Yucel Akkutlu,,,,,Society of Petroleum Engineers,Using lattice-Boltzmann simulation of steady-state gas flow we show that apparent permeability values of nano-scale capillaries could be significantly higher than those predicted by the Klinkenberg slip theory. The difference is due to kinetic effects of gas molecules that have gone through inelastic collisions with the walls on those molecules that make up the bulk fluid in the capillary. The kinetic energy that the bouncing back molecules have and the associated momentum carried to the bulk fluid is not a trivial matter in capillaries with diameter h less than 100nm. It creates a molecular streaming effect that amplifies velocity profile developing across the diameter of capillary. In a sense. it is not only the molecules interacting with the wall that slip but also the bulk fluid. ie. double slip. The double-slip effect is shown using measured permeability data of a crushed nanoporous material with a uniform pore size (10< h< 40 …,True,rS0a3g8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,71,https://onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-154977-MS,4165287538038577987,/scholar?cites=4165287538038577987,,,0,0,0

In this paper a coupled finite element method combined with a condensation technique is proposed to address this issue. Removing the node displacements that have no contribution to fracture widths from the coupled equations. the condensation technique reduces the size of the coupled equations in the proposed method. The numerical method with the condensation technique is verified. Simulations show that the condensation technique can reduce the computation cost effectively. in particular when the fracture propagation regime is viscosity-dominated or the simulation is on the early stage. The effects of the condensation technique on the simulation accuracy. stability. and convergence of the numerical method are discussed.

The flow area is largely determined by proppant distribution while fracture permeability is mainly governed by proppant sizes. To create a fracture with a large flow area. small proppants are essential to maintain a minimum proppant settling velocity; on the other hand. large proppant sizes provide higher proppant pack permeability. Therefore. an optimum operational procedure. i.e.. scheduling of injection rate. proppant size and volume. is required to achieve maximum well productivity index. This. however. requires both field experiments (e.g.. small volume pre-job tests) and an advanced numerical simulator that couples solid and fluid transport with fracture propagation model including mass exchange between reservoir matrix and hydraulic fracture. i.e.. leak-off rate.In this …,True,rS0a3g8AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,31,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516215300094,13065887251544330536,/scholar?cites=13065887251544330536,,https://ebrahimfathi.faculty.wvu.edu/files/d/0e086e8a-119c-444c-ac88-f55fd0bb70fa/bing.pdf,0,0,0

The regimes range from toughness‐dominated cases to viscosity‐dominated cases. covering zero leak‐off situations and small leak‐off situations. Unlike the asymptotic solutions. the numerical method is independent of the energy dissipation regimes and fluid storage regimes. The numerical method pays no special attention to the fracture tip. and it simulates fracture tip behaviors by increasing the number of functions in a natural and uniform manner.

1155533,Counter diffusion and competitive adsorption effects during CO2 injection and coalbed methane production,2008,Ebrahim Fathi and I Yucel Akkutlu,,,,,Society of Petroleum Engineers,Previous investigations have shown that carbon dioxide injection and enhanced coalbed methane production (CO2-ECBM) involves several viscous and diffusive transport mechanisms. raising challenging questions related to the chemically and structurally intricate nature of coalbeds. Injection of gas in a network of natural fractures initiates counter-diffusive transport and competitive (and often selective) sorption processes among the gas molecules in coal. Consequently. the incoming CO2 molecules activate and displace the in-place CH4 molecules. Competitive sorption rates. however. could be controlled by the counter-diffusive mass fluxes during the gas injection and production operations. Nature of the multi-component diffusive transport processes should therefore be understood clearly.

1155560,Energy Audit Analysis of Residential Air-Conditioning Systems in Austin.

TX to 1) characterize the homes and their air-conditioning systems. and 2) estimate the aggregated peak power savings attainable through the implementation of a series of conservation steps. The audit database is restricted to singlefamily detached units. which allows the analysis to be extrapolated to just under one-half of the Austin residential building stock. Characterization of the audit homes reveals that many homes still have “low-hanging fruit” efficiency improvements available. Theoretically enrolling all homes in the utility-sponsored efficiency program yields a potential reduction in the average air-conditioner size in the database from 3.1 tons (11 kW) to 2.2 tons (7.7 kW). which corresponds to a peak power demand reduction of 1.8 kW for the average individual system. The maximum utility-scale peak power reduction for the implementation of this program city-wide is estimated to be as high as 200 MW. which is almost 8% of Austin’s peak electric demand in 2008 and enough to possibly offset new power plant acquisitions. Our calculations estimate that> 97% of homes in the audit database would benefit from enrollment in a home efficiency program and that the cost of savings is significantly less than the cost of new generation facilities.

As growing populations demand more energy supplies and water resources. research aims to analyze the interconnectedness of these two resources. Our study sought to quantify the energy-water relationship in Texas. specifically the relationship between electricity generation and water resources as it pertains to policy and society. We examined the water requirements for various types of electricity generating facilities. for typical systems both nationwide and in Texas. We also addressed the energy requirements of water supply and wastewater treatment systems. comparing national averages with Texas-specific values.

These energy recovery strategies could help offset the electricity consumption of the wastewater sector and represent possible areas for sustainable energy policy implementation. We estimate that anaerobic digestion could save 628 to 4.940 million kWh annually in the United States. In Texas. anaerobic digestion could save 40.2 to 460 million kWh annually and biosolids incineration could save 51.9 to 1.030 million kWh annually.

Steam condensation in the power generation cycle creates a need for cooling. often accomplished using large amounts of water. These large water requirements can lead to negative consequences of power plants dialing down or shutting down during times of low water availability. Consequently. water constraints can translate into energy constraints.

With conventional. independently operated systems. algae production requires significant material inputs. which require energy directly and indirectly. and the WWTP requires significant energy inputs for treatment of the waste streams. The second‐order energy return on investment values for independent operation of the WWTP and the algal biofuels production facility were determined to be 0.37 and 0.42. respectively. By combining the two. energy inputs can be reduced significantly. Consequently. the integrated system can outperform the isolated system. yielding a second‐order energy return on investment of 1.44.

In this study. we propose an experimental framework for policy. implementation. and subsequent evaluation of green stormwater infrastructure within the context of sociotechnical systems and urban experimentation. Sociotechnical systems describe the interaction of complex systems with quantitative and qualitative impacts. Urban experimentation—traditionally referencing climate change programs and their impacts—is a process of evaluating city programs as if in a laboratory setting with hypotheses and evaluated results. We combine these two concepts into a singular framework creating a policy feedback cycle (PFC) for green infrastructure to evaluate municipal green infrastructure plans as an experimental process within the context of a sociotechnical system. After proposing and discussing the PFC. we utilize the tool to research and evaluate the green infrastructure programs of 27 municipalities across the United States. Results indicate that green infrastructure plans should incorporate community involvement and communication. evaluation based on project motivation. and an iterative process for knowledge production. We suggest knowledge brokers as a key resource in connecting the evaluation stage of the feedback cycle to the policy phase. We identify three important needs for green infrastructure experimentation:(i) a fluid definition of green infrastructure in policy;(ii) maintenance and evaluation components of a green infrastructure plan; and (iii …,True,-09dO5EAAAAJ:F2UWTTQJPOcC,65,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/1/105,16409364880337786458,/scholar?cites=16409364880337786458,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/1/105/pdf,0,0,0

A method for identifying sustainable sites,2014,Emily A Grubert and Ashlynn S Stillwell and Michael E Webber,339,Desalination,,10-17,Elsevier,Global water planners are increasingly considering seawater desalination as an alternative to traditional freshwater supplies. Since desalination is both expensive and energy intensive. taking advantage of favorable natural and societal conditions while siting desalination facilities can provide significant financial and environmental returns. Currently. policy makers do not use a location-specific integrated analytical framework to determine where natural and societal conditions are conducive to desalination. This analysis seeks to fill that gap by demonstrating a multi-criteria. geographically-resolved methodology for identifying suitable regions for desalination infrastructure where 1) available renewable resources can offset part of the fossil energy load; 2) feedwater characteristics reduce the total energy needed for desalination; and 3) human populations have capacity and willingness to pay for desalinated water …,True,-09dO5EAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,54,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916414000678,12560475122990208145,/scholar?cites=12560475122990208145,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916414000678,0,0,0
