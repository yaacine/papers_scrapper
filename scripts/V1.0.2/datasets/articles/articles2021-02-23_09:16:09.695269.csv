1051781,Eeyarestatin I inhibits Sec61-mediated protein translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum,2009,Benedict CS Cross and Craig McKibbin and Anna C Callan and Peristera Roboti and Michela Piacenti and Catherine Rabu and Cornelia M Wilson and Roger Whitehead and Sabine L Flitsch and Martin R Pool and Stephen High and Eileithyia Swanton,122,Journal of cell science,23,4393-4400,The Company of Biologists Ltd,Production and trafficking of proteins entering the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells is coordinated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a process that begins with protein translocation via the membrane-embedded ER translocon. The same complex is also responsible for the co-translational integration of membrane proteins and orchestrates polypeptide modifications that are often essential for protein function. We now show that the previously identified inhibitor of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) eeyarestatin 1 (ESI) is a potent inhibitor of protein translocation. We have characterised this inhibition of ER translocation both in vivo and in vitro. and provide evidence that ESI targets a component of the Sec61 complex that forms the membrane pore of the ER translocon. Further analyses show that ESI acts by preventing the transfer of the nascent polypeptide from the co-translational targeting machinery to the …,True,1URWSnEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,94,https://jcs.biologists.org/content/122/23/4393.short,16426493377449883691,/scholar?cites=16426493377449883691,,https://jcs.biologists.org/content/joces/122/23/4393.full.pdf,0,0,0

This study examined 90 garden soils from Western Australia to evaluate predictions of antibiotic resistance genes from total metal conditions by comparing the concentrations of 12 metals and 13 genes related to tetracycline. beta-lactam and sulphonamide resistance. Relationships existed between metals and genes. but trends varied. All metals. except Se and Co. were related to at least one AR gene in terms of absolute gene numbers. but only Al.

Previous studies have described torsinA as a type II protein with a cleavable signal sequence. a single membrane spanning domain. and its C-terminus located in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) lumen. However. in the present study we show that torsinA is not in fact an integral membrane protein. Instead we find that the mature protein associates peripherally with the ER membrane. most likely through an interaction with an integral membrane protein. Consistent with this model. we provide evidence that the signal peptidase complex cleaves the signal sequence of torsinA. and we show that the region previously suggested to form a transmembrane domain is translocated into the lumen of the ER.

Greater than expected fetal growth has been positively associated with the risk of the development of some cancers in childhood. particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia. and the biological mechanisms underlying such associations are thought to involve insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). Circulating IGF levels are highly correlated with fetal growth. and IGFs are believed to play an important role in carcinogenesis; however. these two bodies of evidence have not been well integrated and. as a result. the potential underlying biological mechanisms linking the IGF system with the development of specific childhood cancers have not been elucidated.

In the work presented here. we studied mitotic cell death by making use of a UV-inactivated parvovirus (adeno-associated virus; AAV) that has been shown to induce a DNA damage response and subsequent death of p53-defective cells in mitosis. without affecting the integrity of the host genome. Osteosarcoma cells (U2OSp53DD) that are deficient in p53 and lack the G1 cell cycle checkpoint respond to AAV infection through a transient G2 arrest. We found that the infected U2OSp53DD cells died through mitotic catastrophe with no signs of chromosome condensation or DNA fragmentation. Moreover. cell death was independent of caspases. apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). autophagy and necroptosis. These findings were confirmed by time-lapse microscopy of cellular morphology following AAV infection. The assays used readily revealed apoptosis in other cell types when it was indeed occurring. Taken together the results indicate that in the absence of the G1 checkpoint. mitotic catastrophe occurs in these p53-null cells predominantly as a result of mechanical disruption induced by centrosome overduplication. and not as a consequence of a suicide signal.,True,EBCwo1IAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,59,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022946,11586825776902869502,/scholar?cites=11586825776902869502,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022946,0,0,0

The factors involved have been partially identified and are poorly characterised. Here. using Xenopus laevis egg extracts we show that RNAs are required for proper nuclear envelope assembly following sperm DNA decondensation. Although chromatin remodelling and pre-replication complex formation occur normally. RNA-depleted extracts show a defect in pre-RC activation. The nuclear processes affected by RNA-depletion included ELYS recruitment. which accounts for the deficiency in nuclear pore complex assembly. This results in failure in chromatin relaxation as well as in the import and proper nuclear concentration of the S-phase kinases necessary for DNA replication activation.

LLC,Dicer. an endoribonuclease best-known for its role in microRNA biogenesis and RNA interference pathway. has been shown to play a role in the DNA damage response and repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. However. it remains unknown whether Dicer is also important to preserve genome integrity upon replication stress. To address this question. we focused our study on common fragile sites (CFSs). which are susceptible to breakage after replication stress. We show that inhibition of the Dicer pathway leads to an increase in CFS expression upon induction of replication stress and to an accumulation of 53BP1 nuclear bodies. indicating transmission of replication-associated damage. We also show that in absence of a functional Dicer or Drosha. the assembly into nuclear foci of the Fanconi anemia (FA) protein FANCD2 and of the replication and checkpoint factor TopBP1 in …,True,EBCwo1IAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6633883/,4771917078497038752,/scholar?cites=4771917078497038752,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6633883/,0,0,0

This permits the Cre-mediated and -directed excision of the entire bacterial vector sequences from plasmid constructs to create supercoiled gene expression minicircles for gene therapy. Minicircle yields using standard culture volumes are sufficient for most in vitro and in vivo applications whereas minicircle expression in vitro is significantly increased over standard plasmid transfection.

To effectively address the problem. we introduce a strategy for constructing cancer cell nuclear-targeted copper sulfide nanoparticles (NPs) with a significant photothermal effect to completely kill residual cancer cells and prevent local cancer recurrence. The NPs could directly target the tumor cells and further enter the nucleus by the surface modification of RGD and TAT peptides. Under the irradiation of 980 nm near-infrared laser. the NPs rapidly increase the temperature of the nucleus. destroy the genetic substances. and ultimately lead to an exhaustive apoptosis of the cancer cells.

In this study. we synthesized the stable. water-soluble receptor 1a as a structural mimic of the active site in UDG. Compound 1a contains a 2.6-bis(glycylamino)pyridine group. which mimics the amino acid residues of UDG that interact with uracil through a hydrogen-bonding network; it also possesses a pyrene moiety as a π−π stacking interaction element and fluorescent probe that mimics the aromatic groups (phenyl and fluorescent indolyl units) found in the active site of UDG. Receptor 1a binds selectively to uracil and derivatives (including thymine. 5-formyluracil. 5-fluorouracil. and 5-nitrouracil) and some DNA and RNA nucleosides (including thymidine and …,True,chCPtYgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,22,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo901862x,18001997795936552271,/scholar?cites=18001997795936552271,,,0,0,0

The principal photoreceptor of the fly circadian clock. Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY). contains a C-terminal tail (CTT) helix that binds beside a FAD cofactor and is essential for light signaling. Light reduces the dCRY FAD to an anionic semiquinone (ASQ) radical and increases CTT proteolytic susceptibility but does not lead to CTT chemical modification. Additional changes in proteolytic sensitivity and small-angle X-ray scattering define a conformational response of the protein to light that centers at the CTT but also involves regions remote from the flavin center.

With ectodomains of only ∼20–40 residues. it is unclear how such diminutive viral fusion proteins mediate the initial stages (i.e. membrane contact and close membrane apposition) of the fusion reaction that precede actual membrane merger. We now show that the FAST proteins lack specific receptor-binding activity. and in their natural biological context of promoting cell–cell fusion. rely on cadherins to promote close membrane apposition. The FAST proteins. however. are not specifically reliant on cadherin engagement to mediate membrane apposition as indicated by their ability to efficiently utilize other adhesins in the fusion reaction. Results further indicate that surrogate adhesion proteins that bridge membranes as close as 13 nm apart enhance FAST protein-induced cell–cell fusion. but active actin remodelling is required for maximal fusion activity. The FAST proteins are the first example of membrane fusion proteins that have specifically evolved to function as opportunistic fusogens. designed to exploit and convert naturally occurring adhesion sites into fusion sites. The capacity of surrogate. non-cognate adhesins and active actin remodelling to enhance the cell–cell fusion activity of the FAST proteins are features perfectly suited to the structural and functional evolution of these fusogens as the minimal fusion component of a virus-encoded cellular fusion machine.

In contrast to other hematophagous insects. the triatomine gut is compartmentalized into three segments that perform different functions during blood digestion. Here we report analysis of transcriptomes for each of the segments using pyrosequencing technology. Comparison of transcript frequency in digestive libraries with a whole-body library was used to evaluate expression levels. All classes of digestive enzymes were highly expressed. with a predominance of cysteine and aspartic proteinases. the latter showing a significant expansion through gene duplication. Although no protein digestion is known to occur in the anterior midgut (AM). protease transcripts were found. suggesting secretion as pro-enzymes. being possibly activated in the posterior midgut (PM).

The expression of 9-O-acetyl gangliosides recognized by the JONES mAb correlates with periods of cell migration and axonal pathfinding.

In this study we have investigated the effect of JONES mAb addition on the cytoskeleton of dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro. We have shown that blockage of 9-O-acetyl gangliosides induces the appearance of lateral spikes along the neurites in addition to the effect on the growth cone. Microfilament and microtubular rearrangements accompany these structural modifications. We present evidence that the main effect of JONES mAb is to induce microtubule depolymerization both in growth cones and neurites.

The pathway is centered on PIWI clade Argonaute proteins and the associated small non-coding RNAs termed piRNAs. In this study. we set to investigate the evolutionary conservation of the piRNA pathway in the hemimetabolous insect Rhodnius prolixus. Our transcriptome profiling reveals that core components of the pathway are expressed during previtellogenic stages of oogenesis. Rhodnius’ genome harbors four putative piwi orthologs. We show that Rp-piwi2. Rp-piwi3 and Rp-ago3. but not Rp-piwi1 transcripts are produced in the germline tissues and maternally deposited in the mature eggs. Consistent with a role in Rhodnius oogenesis. parental RNAi against the Rp-piwi2. Rp-piwi3 and Rp-ago3 results in severe egg laying and female adult fertility defects. Furthermore. we show that the reduction of the Rp-piwi2 levels by parental RNAi disrupts oogenesis by causing a dramatic loss of trophocytes. egg chamber degeneration and oogenesis arrest. Intriguingly. the putative Rp-Piwi2 protein features a polyglutamine tract at its N-terminal region. which is conserved in PIWI proteins encoded in the genome of other Triatomine species. Together with R. prolixus. these hematophagous insects are primary vectors of the Chagas disease.

Accumulation of AGEs in the body is implicated in various pathophysiological conditions like diabetes. cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis. Numerous studies have reported the connecting link between AGEs and the various complications associated with diseases. Hence. detection and measurement of AGEs becomes centrally important to understand and manage the menace created by AGEs inside the body. In recent years. an increasing number of immunotechniques as well as bioanalytical techniques have been developed to efficiently measure the levels of AGEs. but most of them are still far away from being clinically consistent. as relative disparity and ambiguity masks their standardization.

Proteins are susceptible to ROS modifications of amino acid side chains which alter protein structure. Among the amino acids. Cysteine (Cys) is more prone to oxidation by ROS because of its high nucleophilic property. The reactivity of Cys with ROS is due to the presence of thiol group. In the oxidised form. Cys forms disulfide bond. which are primary covalent cross-link found in proteins. and which stabilize the native conformation of a protein. Indirect evidence suggests that thiol modifications by ROS may be involved in neurodegenerative disorders. but the significance and precise extent of the contributions are poorly understood.

Whereas no extensive studies have been carried out to assess the role of EGPs in secondary complications of diabetes. numerous investigators have demonstrated the role of AGEs. Early glycation involves attachment of glucose on ε-NH2 of lysine residues of proteins leading to generation of the Amadori product (an early glycation species). This study reports the structural and immunological characterization of EGPs of HSA because we believe that during persistent hyperglycemia the HSA. one of the major blood proteins. can undergo fast glycation.

The aim of this study is to investigate the promoter methylation. loss of expression and significance of PTEN gene in breast cancer and to determine the correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression.Methods: Promoter methylation and loss of expression of PTEN gene were analyzed using methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemical methods respectively. The chi square test is used to correlate the promoter methylation and gene expression with their clincopathologic parameters.Results: We examined 53 breast cancer specimens and 10 normal tissues adjacent to tumor. The results showed a 58.5% promoter methylation in PTEN gene and none in normal tissue. PTEN methylation was observed in advanced stages III-IV (81.8%. 18 of 22. P= 0.015) and higher grades G2-G3 (71.4%. 20 of 28. P= 0.043) of disease. The correlation of PTEN methylation with clinical stage and tumor grade was found to be statistically significant. Nuclear PTEN expression was detected in 73.6%(39 of 53) cases of breast cancer and in the remaining 26.4%(14 of 53) cases expressional loss was observed. The loss of PTEN expression was observed in all normal tissues (10 of 10). The loss of PTEN expression was significantly correlated with patient’s age (P= 0.028) and clinical stage (P= 0.029).

F,,300-306,,Leishmania arginase is a potential drug target for the treatment of leishmaniasis because this binuclear manganese metalloenzyme initiates de novo polyamine biosynthesis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of l-arginine to generate l-ornithine and urea. The product l-ornithine subsequently undergoes decarboxylation to yield putrescine. which in turn is utilized for spermidine biosynthesis. Polyamines such as spermidine are essential for the growth and survival of the parasite. so inhibition of enzymes in the polyamine-biosynthetic pathway comprises an effective strategy for treating parasitic infections. To this end. two X-ray crystal structures of L. mexicana arginase complexed with α.α-disubstituted boronic amino-acid inhibitors based on the molecular scaffold of 2-(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid are now reported.

Importantly. this “background” level of receptor phosphorylation is insufficient to effect a downstream response. suggesting that strict controls are present and prohibit full activation. Here a mechanism is described in which control of FGFR2 activation is provided by the adaptor protein Grb2. Dimeric Grb2 binds to the C termini of two FGFR2 molecules. This heterotetramer is capable of a low-level receptor transphosphorylation. but C-terminal phosphorylation and recruitment of signaling proteins are sterically hindered. Upon stimulation.

Reduction of Grb2 concentration permits Plcγ1 access to the receptor. Recruitment of Plcγ1 in this way is sufficient to upregulate phospholipase activity. This results in elevated phosphatidylinositol 4. 5-bisphosphate turnover and intracellular calcium levels. thus leading to increased cell motility and promotion of cell-invasive behavior in the absence of extracellular receptor stimulation.

1052294,Interaction with Shc prevents aberrant Erk activation in the absence of extracellular stimuli,2013,Kin Man Suen and Chi-Chuan Lin and Roger George and Fernando A Melo and Eleanor R Biggs and Zamal Ahmed and Melanie N Drake and Swathi Arur and Stefan T Arold and John E Ladbury,20,Nature structural & molecular biology,5,620,Nature Publishing Group,Control mechanisms that prevent aberrant signaling are necessary to maintain cellular homeostasis. We describe a new mechanism by which the adaptor protein Shc directly binds the MAP kinase Erk. thus preventing its activation in the absence of extracellular stimuli. The Shc–Erk complex restricts Erk nuclear translocation. restraining Erk-dependent transcription of genes. including those responsible for oncogenic growth. The complex forms through unique binding sites on both the Shc PTB domain and the N-terminal lobe of Erk. Upon receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation. a conformational change within Shc—induced through interaction with the phosphorylated receptor—releases Erk. allowing it to fulfill its role in signaling. Thus. in addition to its established role in promoting MAP kinase signaling in stimulated cells. Shc negatively regulates Erk activation in the absence of growth factors and thus could be …,True,VRb-dOoAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,21,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.2557.pdf?origin=ppub,10958681432976131051,/scholar?cites=10958681432976131051,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4059177/,0,0,0

LOR condenses lysine and 2-oxoglutarate into saccharopine. using NADPH as cofactor and SDH converts saccharopine into α-aminoadipate δ-semialdehyde and glutamic acid. using NAD as cofactor. The distribution pattern of LOR and SDH among different tissues of Phaseolus vulgaris was determined. The hypocotyl contained the highest specific activity. whereas in seeds the activities of LOR and SDH were below the limit of detection. Precipitation of hypocotyl proteins with increasing concentrations of PEG 8000 revealed one broad peak of SDH activity. indicating that two isoforms may be present. a bifunctional LOR-SDH and possibly a monofunctional SDH.

Além disso. a lisina é o principal aminoácido limitante em todos os cereais e por cerca de 30 anos a via do ácido aspártico tem sido estudada em plantas. com o intuito de desvendar e caracterizar os principais pontos chave na regulação das vias de biossíntese desses aminoácidos. Duas etapas distintas. uma primeira originada a partir do desenvolvimento da cultura de tecidos (anos 70-80) e a segunda a partir do desenvolvimento de técnicas para a transformação de plantas (anos 90). permitiram que mutantes bioquímicos e plantas trangênicas fossem produzidos com alterações específicas em passos metabólicos chave. levando à superprodução e acúmulo de treonina em vários tecidos das plantas. Entretanto. a acumulação de lisina em sementes não foi obtida. Tal fato. associado a estudos bioquímicos da via de degradação da lisina em cereais e em leguminosas. indicou que a manipulação da degradação seria tão ou mais importante que a manipulação da biossíntese de lisina para o acúmulo deste aminoácido em sementes dos cereais .

The catabolism of lysine is performed by the action of two consecutive enzymes. lysine 2-oxoglutarate reductase (LOR. EC 1.5.1.8) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH. EC 1.5.1.9). The final soluble lysine concentration in cereal seeds is controlled by both synthesis and catabolism rates. The production and characterization of high-lysine plants species depends on knowledge of the regulatory aspects of lysine metabolism and manipulation of the key enzymes. We have for the first time isolated. partially purified. and characterized LOR and SDH from developing sorghum seeds. which exhibited low levels of activity.

Changing proline content in drought-stressed bean plants,2018,Marcia Eugenia Amaral Carvalho and Paulo Roberto de Camargo and Salete A Gaziola and Ricardo Antunes Azevedo,9,Comunicata Scientiae,2,292-297,UFPI-Universidade Federal do Piauí,Abiotic stresses negatively affect crop development and yield. However. the use of seaweed extracts can alleviate production losses through improvement of the antioxidant system and synthesis of compatible osmolytes. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Ascophyllum nodosum extract on antioxidant response and yield of common bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) under drought stress. Therefore. two methods of application (foliar spray and soil irrigation) and two doses (5 and 10 mL L-1) were tested. whereas untreated plants were used as control. There were no significant differences in malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents among treatments. indicating that application of seaweed extract did not change the oxidative status in treated plants when compared to the control ones. On the other hand. the use of seaweed extract increased proline content even prior to drought stress (46.3 to 145.4% when compared to the control). and this increment remained until the 10th day of stress (from 60.1 to 201.7% over the reference plants). supporting early evidences that A. nodosum extract is a plant elicitor. The yield parameters were not affected by the extract. probably due to the severe drought stress which plants were submitted. The results suggest that A. nodosum extract affects proline metabolism in Phaseolus vulgaris plants. making the synthesis of this osmolyte more responsive to drought stress because seaweed-treated plants presented a higher proline content than the control ones during the exposure to water deficit.,True,OpmdU58AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,14,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6522476,560499150027956272,/scholar?cites=560499150027956272,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/6522476.pdf,0,0,0

This study evaluated Cd effects on the enzymatic activities of lysine (Lys) metabolism. storage protein and amino acid profile in maize. Stress parameters were also assessed. In vegetative organs. Cd was accumulated in the following decreasing order: roots > stems > leaves. Cadmium accumulation in grains decreased at grain maturity (from 0.25 to 0.07 µg g−1 DW). In leaves. neither hydrogen peroxide content nor superoxide dismutase. catalase. ascorbate peroxide and guaiacol peroxidase activities did not change in Cd-treated plants compared to control plants. Lipid peroxidation was not detected in immature grains and leaves of plants under Cd exposure. indicating that Cd accumulation mainly in the roots is a mechanism to avoid oxidative stress in aboveground parts of the plant. However. Lys metabolism in immature grains was modified. showing increases in the specific activities of aspartate kinase (AK) and dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) after Cd exposure. AK sensitivity to Lys feedback inhibition increased. but decreased in DHDPS in Cd-treated plants. suggesting differential regulation for these enzymes. In mature grains. the Lys content did not change. while the proline content increased by 54 % in Cd-treated plants.

1052407,Implantation in the baboon: endometrial responses,1999,AT Fazleabas and JJ Kim and S Srinivasan and KM Donnelly and A Brudney and RC Jaffe,17,,03,257-265,Copyright© 1999 by Thieme Medical Publishers. Inc.,Blastocyst implantation in the baboon usually occurs between 8 and 10 days post ovulation. Changes that occur within this window of receptivity and immediately following implantation can be divided into three distinct phases. The first phase. regulated by estrogen and progesterone. is characterized primarily by changes in both the luminal and glandular epithelial cells in preparation for blastocyst apposition and attachment. The second phase is the further modulation of these steroid induced changes in both epithelial and stromal cells by embryonic signals.

These animals have a point mutation in carboxypeptidase E (CPE). an exopeptidase that removes C-terminal basic amino acids from peptide intermediates. The mutation renders the enzyme unstable. and it is rapidly degraded. Although the infertility of Cpefat/fat mice has not been systematically investigated. it is thought to be due to a deficit in GnRH processing. We have evaluated this hypothesis and found hypothalamic GnRH levels to be reduced by 65–78% and concentrations of pro-GnRH and C-terminal-extended intermediates to be high. Basal serum gonadotropin contents are similar among wild-type. heterozygous. and homozygous mice. Testis morphology and function are abnormal in older obese Cpefat/fat mice. Matings between homozygous mutants yield a 5% pregnancy rate.

1052413,Pro-GnRH processing,2002,William C Wetsel and Sudha Srinivasan,141,,,221-241,Elsevier,An inspection of the deduced amino acid sequences from the nine complementary pro-GnRH forms demonstrates several points. All pro-gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) proteins contain GnRH at their N-termini and the peptide is separated by a putative processing site from GnRH-associated peptide (GAP). The organization and spatial arrangement of these sequences suggest that the enzymes that process the pro-GnRH in a given cell are similar across all species. In addition. excision of the GnRH peptide from the precursor is performed by an endopeptidase. Because most peptide precursors appear to be processed at monobasic or dibasic residues. the endopeptidase could cleave the pro-GnRH after the Lys or Arg residues. The regulation of peptide bioactivity is a complex process.

SMAD4. and Hereditary Hemorrhagic,2016,SUDHA SRINIVASAN and JONATHAN N BERG and DOUGLASA MARCHUK,,Epstein's Inborn Errors of Development: The Molecular Basis of Clinical Disorders of Morphogenesis,,393,Oxford University Press,Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) was first described over a 100 years ago. but an understanding of its molecular basis began only with the identification of genes mutated in this disorder (1984 to 2004). Loss-of-function mutations in ENDOGLIN (ENG). the first identified HHT gene (chromosome 9q33-q34). cause HHT type 1 (or HHT1). HHT1 families show a higher incidence of pulmonary involvement than other HHT families. HHT caused by loss-of-function mutations in ACTIVIN RECEPTOR–LIKE KINASE 1 (ACVRL1 or ALK1. which is used in the following text)(chromosome 12q13) has been termed HHT type 2 (or HHT2). These families exhibit a higher incidence of liver involvement and later onset of symptoms. In a third type of HHT. called juvenile polyposis (JP) HHT. all affected individuals have JP along with an inherited predisposition to malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract in addition to having HHT. SMAD4 is the gene mutated in JP-HHT and maps to chromosome 18q21. All 3 causative genes identified so far are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. indicating that HHT occurs because of dysregulated signaling through this pathway. There is evidence for a fourth locus on chromosome 5q. but the mutated gene at this locus is yet to be identified (Cole et al.. 2005).Mutations in ENG and ALK1 genes are. for the most part. familyspecific. Numerous mutations have been described in both genes that are predicted to abrogate their function and in many cases make no protein product at all.

APC/C is activated by Cdc20 and inhibited by the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). which delays mitotic exit when the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is activated. We previously identified apcin as a small molecule ligand of Cdc20 that inhibits APC/C Cdc20 and prolongs mitosis. Here we find that apcin paradoxically shortens mitosis when SAC activity is high. These opposing effects of apcin arise from targeting of a common binding site in Cdc20 required for both substrate ubiquitination and MCC-dependent APC/C inhibition.

Using this assay system. we found that fusion between single GUVs and BV envelopes was significantly enhanced at around pH 5.0–6.0. which suggests that: (1) envelope glycoprotein GP64-mediated membrane fusion within the endosome of insect cells was reproduced in our artificial system; (2) acidic phospholipids in GUVs are necessary for this fusion. which are in agreement with the previous results with conventional small liposomes including large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles; and (3) the efficiency of fusion …,True,UlouN1gAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273610001604,6370115416577820670,/scholar?cites=6370115416577820670,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273610001604,0,0,0

Challenges remain with respect to the development of such systems. including label-free output detection and the rapidity of operation. Here. we propose integration of biological nanopores with DNA molecules for development of a logical operating system. We configured outputs “1” and “0” as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is or is not translocated through a nanopore; unlabeled DNA was detected electrically. A negative-AND (NAND) operation was successfully conducted within approximately 10 min. which is rapid compared with previous studies using unlabeled DNA. In addition. this operation was executed in a four-droplet network. DNA molecules and associated information were transferred among droplets via biological nanopores. This system would facilitate linking of molecules and electronic interfaces.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Connexin‐43 (Cx43) containing giant liposomes (GL) were prepared by a baculovirus expression–liposome fusion method. Recombinant budded viruses expressing Cx43 were prepared and then fused with GLs containing DOPG/DOPC at pH 4.5. Connexon formation on the GL membrane was observed by transmission electron microscope. Hydrophilic fluorescent dye transfers were observed through a Cx43‐mediated pathway not only between Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells with Cx43 but also from giant Cx43 liposomes to Cx43‐expressing U2OS cells (human osteosarcoma cell). The functional connexin‐containing liposome is expected to be useful for cellular cytosolic delivery systems. The original orientation and function of Cx43 was maintained after integration into the liposomes.

All members of the Herpesviridae. including VZV. have a conserved core fusion complex composed of glycoproteins. gB. gH and gL. The ectodomain of the primary fusogen. gB. has five domains. DI-V. of which DI contains the fusion loops needed for fusion function. We recently demonstrated that DIV is critical for fusion initiation. which was revealed by a 2.8Å structure of a VZV neutralizing mAb. 93k. bound to gB and mutagenesis of the gB-93k interface. To further assess the mechanism of mAb 93k neutralization. the binding site of a non-neutralizing mAb to gB. SG2. was compared to mAb 93k using single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The gB-SG2 interface partially overlapped with that of gB-93k but. unlike mAb 93k. mAb SG2 did not interact with the gB N-terminus. suggesting a potential role for the gB N-terminus in membrane fusion. The gB ectodomain structure in the absence of antibody was defined at near atomic resolution by single particle cryo-EM (3.9Å) of native full-length gB purified from infected cells and by X-ray crystallography (2.4Å) of the transiently expressed ectodomain. Both structures revealed that the VZV gB N-terminus (aa72-114) was flexible based on the absence of visible structures in the cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography data but the presence of gB N-terminal peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry.

The first step in preparing samples for cryo-EM is to select and optimize the right grid for the specimen. This screening process needs consideration in many aspects including concentration and stability of the specimen. compatibility with grid material and optimum ice thickness across the grid. Importantly. the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a micrograph is closely related to vitrifying the grid sample with the optimum imaging condition. Here we describe overall strategies for grid selection and optimization by understanding the properties of grids and a variety of techniques for grid treatment for high-resolution electron micrographs.

The (RAG1-RAG2)2 recombinase (RAG) recognizes recombination signal sequences (RSSs) containing a heptamer. a spacer of 12 or 23 base pairs. and a nonamer (12-RSS or 23-RSS) and introduces precise breaks at RSS-coding segment junctions. RAG forms synaptic complexes only with one 12-RSS and one 23-RSS. a dogma known as the 12/23 rule that governs the recombination fidelity.

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to disable various features of host immunity and cellular defense. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) is known to inhibit host protein translation and could be a target for antiviral therapy against COVID-19. However. how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents this translational blockage for the production of its own proteins is an open question. Here. we report a bipartite mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 which operates by: (1) hijacking the host ribosome via direct interaction of its C-terminal domain (CT) with the 40S ribosomal subunit and (2) specifically lifting this inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 via a direct interaction  of its N-terminal domain (NT) with the 59 untranslated region (5′ UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation. the 5′ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT. suggesting that the Nsp1-NTUTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT40S interaction. Indeed. lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5′ UTR to escape the translational inhibition. supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5′ UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1.

1055232,Characterization of a membrane binding loop leads to engineering botulinum neurotoxin B with improved therapeutic efficacy,2020,Linxiang Yin and Geoffrey Masuyer and Sicai Zhang and Jie Zhang and Shin-Ichiro Miyashita and David Burgin and Laura Lovelock and Shu-Fen Coker and Tian-min Fu and Pål Stenmark and Min Dong,18,PLoS biology,3,e3000618,Public Library of Science,Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are a family of bacterial toxins with seven major serotypes (BoNT/A–G). The ability of these toxins to target and bind to motor nerve terminals is a key factor determining their potency and efficacy. Among these toxins. BoNT/B is one of the two types approved for medical and cosmetic uses. Besides binding to well-established receptors. an extended loop in the C-terminal receptor-binding domain (HC) of BoNT/B (HC/B) has been proposed to also contribute to toxin binding to neurons by interacting with lipid membranes (termed lipid-binding loop [LBL]). Analogous loops exist in the HCs of BoNT/C. D. G. and a chimeric toxin DC. However. it has been challenging to detect and characterize binding of LBLs to lipid membranes. Here. using the nanodisc system and biolayer interferometry assays. we find that HC/DC. C. and G. but not HC/B and HC/D. are capable of binding to receptor-free lipids directly. with HC/DC having the highest level of binding. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate the critical role of consecutive aromatic residues at the tip of the LBL for binding of HC/DC to lipid membranes. Taking advantage of this insight. we then create a “gain-of-function” mutant HC/B by replacing two nonaromatic residues at the tip of its LBL with tryptophan. Cocrystallization studies confirm that these two tryptophan residues do not alter the structure of HC/B or the interactions with its receptors. Such a mutated HC/B gains the ability to bind receptor-free lipid membranes and shows enhanced binding to cultured neurons. Finally. full-length BoNT/B containing two tryptophan mutations in its LBL. together with two additional mutations …,True,NAYUxWQAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,4,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000618,5261890705545416599,/scholar?cites=5261890705545416599,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000618,0,0,0

NLRP1 and CARD8 use their C-terminal (CT) fragments containing a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and the UPA subdomain of a function-to-find domain (FIIND) for self-oligomerization and recruitment of the inflammasome adaptor ASC and/or caspase-1. Here. we report cryo-EM structures of NLRP1-CT and CARD8-CT assemblies. in which the respective CARDs form central helical filaments that are promoted by oligomerized. but flexibly linked UPAs surrounding the filaments. We discover that subunits in the central NLRP1CARD filament dimerize with additional exterior CARDs. which roughly doubles its thickness and is unique among all known CARD filaments. The thick NLRP1 filament only forms with the presence of UPA. which we hypothesize drives the intrinsic propensity for NLRP1CARD dimerization. Structural analyses provide insights on the requirement of ASC for NLRP1-CT signalling and the contrasting direct recruitment of caspase-1 by CARD8-CT. Additionally. we present a low-resolution 4-ASCCARD-4-caspase-1CARD octamer structure. illustrating that ASC uses opposing surfaces for NLRP1. versus caspase-1. recruitment.

1055264,Age-related decreases in striatal DA produces cognitive deficits in male rats,2011,Saida Haider and Saiqa Tabassum and S Ali and S Saleem and AK Khan and DJ Haleem,1,J Pharm Nutr Sci,1,,,Aging is a process that presents various alterations in physiological. behavioral and neurochemical processes. It causes impairment of CNS functions which lead to changes in memory. cognition and other behavioral performances. Reports have shown that aging causes neurochemical alterations in various physiological functions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cognitive changes in relation to process of aging. For this 20 male rats were taken. 10 young (4-6 months) and 10 old (18-22 months). Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was performed to monitor changes in learning and memory while Object-Recognition Task (ORT) was performed to evaluate changes in cognitive function. After behavioral assessment decapitation was done and rat brain was dissected to isolate striatum. Then neurochemical analysis was performed by HPLC-EC to monitor changes in striatal DA and DOPAC levels. Results of behavioral tests showed that aged rats exhibited a significant impairment of long-term memory. While cognitive ability assessed by ORT was also impaired in aged rats. Neurochemical results showed that there was a significant decline in striatal dopamine (DA) concentration while its metabolite DOPAC was significantly increased in aged rats. Hence aging has a significant negative influence on cognitive functions. Age-related behavioral deficits may occur as a result of decline in DA levels in striatum leading to changes in memory and cognitive performance.,True,vNf6eUEAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,23,http://www.lifescienceglobal.com/images/stories/JPANS/Issue1_1/008-Haider_JPNS.pdf,1604487119981275172,/scholar?cites=1604487119981275172,,http://www.lifescienceglobal.com/images/stories/JPANS/Issue1_1/008-Haider_JPNS.pdf,0,0,0

In the present study. the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and their neurochemical basis following repeated administration of extravirgin olive oil were monitored. Male albino Wistar rats were used during study. Animals of test group were given olive oil orally at the dose of 0.25 mL/kg daily for 4 weeks. Control rats received equal volume of water. Elevated-plus maze (EPM) test and forced swim test (FST) were performed for the assessment of anxiety and depression like symptoms. An increase in time spent in open arm in EPM and increased struggling time in FST following long-term administration of olive oil  indicate that olive oil has anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. Neurochemical results showed that repeated administration of olive oil decreased the levels of brain 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine). 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid). and levels of DA (dopamine); however. levels of DA metabolite HVA (homovalinic acid) were increased. Hence. present findings suggest that olive oil has neuroprotective effects. It reduces behavioral deficits via altering 5-HT and DA metabolism. So it could be used as a therapeutic substance for the treatment of depression and anxiety.,True,vNf6eUEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,22,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2013/615685.pdf,5278677194028721930,/scholar?cites=5278677194028721930,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2013/615685.pdf,0,0,0

There appear to be an intense need for the development of therapeutic strategies that not only improve brain functions but also prevent neurodegeneration. The oxidative stress is one of the main causative factors of AD. Various antioxidants are being investigated to prevent neurodegeneration in AD. The objective of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of naringenin (NAR) against AlCl3+D-gal induced AD-like symptoms in an animal model. Rats were orally pre-treated with NAR (50 mg/kg) for two weeks and then exposed to AlCl3+D-gal (150 mg/kg + 300 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for one week to develop AD-like symptoms. The standard drug. donepezil (DPZ) was used as a stimulator of cholinergic activity. Our results showed that NAR pre-treatment significantly protected AD-like behavioral disturbances in rats. In DPZ group. rats showed improved cognitive and cholinergic functions but the neuropsychiatric functions were not completely improved and showed marked histopathological alterations. However. NAR not only prevented AlCl3+D-gal induced AD-like symptoms but also significantly prevented neuropsychiatric dysfunctions in rats. Results of present study suggest that NAR may play a role in enhancing neuroprotective and cognition functions and it can potentially be considered as a neuroprotective compound for therapeutic management of AD in the future.,True,vNf6eUEAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,12,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227631,10549659865738802697,/scholar?cites=10549659865738802697,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227631,0,0,0

Bach2 suppresses the maintenance of the Batf and Batf3 expression through the inhibition of IL-4 production. Second. the Bach2–Batf complex directly binds to the Batf and Batf3 gene loci and reduces transcription by interfering with the Batf–Irf4 complex.

Gas-fermenting acetogens offer a potential solution and several commercial gas fermentation plants are currently under construction. As energy limits acetogen metabolism. supply of H2 should diminish substrate loss to CO2 and facilitate production of reduced and energy-intensive products. However. the effects of H2 supply on CO-grown acetogens have yet to be experimentally quantified under controlled growth conditions. Here. we quantify the effects of H2 supplementation by comparing growth on CO. syngas. and a high-H2 CO gas mix using chemostat cultures of Clostridium autoethanogenum. Cultures were characterised at the molecular level using metabolomics. proteomics. gas analysis. and a genome-scale metabolic model. CO-limited chemostats operated at two steady-state biomass concentrations facilitated co-utilisation of CO and H2. We show that H2 supply strongly impacts carbon distribution with a fourfold reduction in substrate loss as CO2 (61% vs. 17%) and a proportional increase of flux to ethanol (15% vs. 61%). Notably. H2 supplementation lowers the molar acetate/ethanol ratio by fivefold. At the molecular level. quantitative proteome analysis showed no obvious changes leading to these metabolic rearrangements suggesting the involvement of post-translational regulation.

Mate-guarding is assumed to be mediated by two different types of motivation: sexual motivation toward the opposite sex and competitive motivation toward the same sex. The genetic/molecular mechanisms underlying how mate presence affects male competitive motivation in a triadic relationship has remained largely unknown. Here we showed that male medaka fish prominently exhibit mate-guarding behavior. The presence of a female robustly triggers male-male competition for the female in a triadic relationship (2 males and 1 female). The male-male competition resulted in one male occupying a dominant position near the female while interfering with the other male's approach of the female. Paternity testing revealed that the dominant male had a significantly higher mating success rate than the other male in a triadic relationship. We next generated medaka mutants of arginine-vasotocin (avt) and its receptors (V1a1. V1a2) and revealed that two genes. avt and V1a2. are required for normal mate-guarding behavior. In addition. behavioral analysis of courtship behaviors in a dyadic relationship and aggressive behaviors within a male group revealed that avt mutant males displayed decreased sexual motivation but showed normal aggression. In contrast. heterozygote V1a2 mutant males displayed decreased aggression. but normal mate-guarding and courtship behavior. Thus. impaired mate-guarding in avt and V1a2 homozygote mutants may be due to the loss of sexual motivation toward the opposite …,True,52REL2MAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,36,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005009,14134512286197103975,/scholar?cites=14134512286197103975,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005009,0,0,0

Recently. there has been increasing interest in proteomics of Drosophila melanogaster. because detailed and comprehensive gene annotations have made it straightforward to identify proteins analyzed by mass spectrometry. We have applied proteomic analysis to the male reproductive system with the aim of understanding sperm maturation not only during the process of spermatogenesis. but also during the movement of sperm from the seminal vesicle through the male reproductive system and into the uterus following copulation.

Previous work has shown that growth of bladder cancer cells on a matrix derived from normal basement membrane suppresses many malignant features that are displayed when the cells are grown on a matrix that has been modified by malignant tumors. This work was undertaken to investigate proteome-level changes as determined by a new commercially available proteome display involving 2-dimensional chromatography for bladder cancer cells grown on different extracellular matrix preparations that modulate the expression of the malignant phenotype. Depending on the matrix. between 1300 and 2000 distinct peaks were detected by two-dimensional chromatographic fractionation of 2.1 – 4.4 mg of total cellular protein.

Due to the rarity of this disease. its reported survival and clinical associations have been inconsistent due to reliance on case reports and limited case series. As a result. the prognostic implication of this cancer subtype remains unclear. Using the US Surveillance.

GRCC cases display a poorer prognosis than non-GRCC carcinomas of the breast irrespective of age. AJCC staging. tumor grade. joint hormone receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. and treatment. Similar to non-GRCC carcinomas. older age and higher American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/TNM staging were associated with poorer prognosis for GRCC. while treatment with surgery and radiation were associated with improved survival. Radiation. specifically in the setting of breast-conserving surgery. further improved survival compared to surgery alone.

To address these issues. one approach is to target a subset of metabolites that share a functional group. such as ketones and aldehydes. using chemoselective tagging. Here we report a greatly improved chemoselective method for the quantitative analysis of hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbonyl-containing metabolites directly in biological samples. This method is based on direct tissue or cells extraction with simultaneous derivatization of stable and labile carbonylated metabolites using N-[2-(aminooxy)ethyl]-N.N-dimethyl-1-dodecylammonium (QDA) and 13CD3 labeled QDA.

APOE encodes for three main isoforms in humans (E2. E3. and E4). Homozygous E4 individuals have more than a 10-fold higher risk for developing late-onset AD. while E2 carriers are protected. A hallmark of AD is a reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism. alluding to a strong metabolic component in disease onset and progression. Interestingly. E4 individuals display a similar regional pattern of cerebral glucose hypometabolism decades prior to disease onset. Mapping this metabolic landscape may help elucidate the underlying biological mechanism of APOE-associated risk for AD. Efficient metabolic coupling of neurons and glia is necessary for proper neuronal function. and disruption in glial energy distribution has been proposed to contribute to neuronal cell death and AD pathology.

Using the National Cancer Institute’s surveillance. epidemiology. and end results (SEER) program database. we documented recent trends in incidence. mortality. demographical characteristics. and survival on this rare subtype of urinary bladder cancer. The overall age-adjusted incidence and mortality of CCA was 0.087 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.069–0.107) and 0.064 (95% CI: 0.049–0.081) respectively per million population. In comparison to non-CCAs. CCAs were more commonly associated with younger age (< 60 years old. p= 0.005). female (p< 0.001). black ethnicity (p= 0.001). grade III (p< 0.001). and higher AJCC 6th staging (p< 0.001). In addition. CCA patients more frequently received complete cystectomy (p< 0.001) and beam radiation (p< 0.001) than non-CCA patients. Our study showed a poorer prognosis of CCAs compared to all other carcinomas of the urinary bladder (p< 0.001). accounted for by higher tumor staging of CCA cases.

The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is a tumor suppressor that canonically regulates cell cycle progression; however. recent studies have highlighted a functional role for pRb in controlling cellular metabolism. Here. we report that loss of the gene encoding pRb (Rb1) in a transgenic mutant Kras-driven model of lung cancer results in metabolic reprogramming. Our tracer studies using bolus dosing of [U-13 C]-glucose revealed an increase in glucose carbon incorporation into select glycolytic intermediates. Consistent with this result. Rb1-depleted tumors exhibited increased expression of key glycolytic enzymes. Interestingly. loss of Rb1 did not alter mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation compared to lung tumors with intact Rb1. Additional tracer studies using [U-13 C. 15 N]-glutamine and [U-13 C]-lactate demonstrated that loss of Rb1 did not alter glutaminolysis or utilization of circulating lactate within the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) in vivo. Taken together. these data suggest that the loss of Rb1 promotes a glycolytic phenotype. while not altering pyruvate oxidative metabolism or glutamine anaplerosis in Kras-driven lung tumors.

Following a brief fasting period. we orally administered a solution of [U-13 C] glucose through a blunt gavage needle without anesthesia. at a physiological dose commonly used for glucose tolerance tests (2 g/kg bodyweight). We defined isotopic enrichment in plasma and tissue at 15. 30. 120. and 240 min post-gavage. 13 C-labeled glucose peaked in plasma around 15 min post-gavage. followed by period of metabolic decay and clearance until 4 h.

Even in the crowded environment of the cell. such assemblies are unlikely to form by chance. thereby providing a sensitive regulation of cellular processes. Furthermore. selectivity and sensitivity may be achieved by the requirement for concerted folding and binding of previously unfolded components.

Increasing evidence further indicates that lncRNAs are important for gene expression during cell differentiation and development through various mechanisms such as nuclear organization. post-transcription regulation. alternative splicing. and epigenetic regulation. Thus. aberrant expression of lncRNAs can cause abnormality in those cellular functions and lead to various pathological conditions. One of such fatal consequences is cancer metastasis which is responsible for more than 90% of cancer-related deaths. A good understanding of how lncRNAs regulate different genetic and epigenetic changes during different stages of cancer metastasis is important not only for general cancer biology but also for identiﬁ cation of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for treatment of metastatic cancer.

Here. we developed a high-efficiency. high-throughput and quantitative two-color fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based screening strategy to support the rapid generation of ribozyme-based control devices with user-specified regulatory activities. The high-efficiency of this screening strategy enabled the isolation of a single functional sequence from a library of over 10             6              variants within two sorting cycles.

Quantitative measurement of the in vitro cleavage rate constants associated with ribozyme-based devices is essential for advancing the molecular design and optimization of this class of gene-regulatory devices. One of the key challenges encountered in ribozyme characterization is the efficient generation of full-length RNA from in vitro transcription reactions. where conditions generally lead to significant ribozyme cleavage. Current methods for generating full-length ribozyme-encoding RNA rely on a trans-blocking strategy. which requires a laborious gel separation and extraction step.

They may recognize non-self glycans typically found on pathogens and/or host glycans. The collectin and galectin families are prominent examples of these two lectin categories. Collectins are C-type lectins that contain a carbohydrate recognition domain and a collagen-like domain. Members of this group include surfactant protein A (SP-A) and D (SP-D). secreted by the alveolar epithelium to the alveolar fluid. Lung collectins bind to several microorganisms. which results in pathogen aggregation and/or killing. and enhances phagocytosis of pathogens by alveolar macrophages. Moreover. SP-A and SP-D influence macrophage responses. contributing to resolution of inflammation. and SP-A is essential for tissue-repair functions of macrophages. Galectins also function by interacting directly with pathogens or by modulating the immune system in response to the infection. Direct binding may result in enhanced or impaired infection of target cells. or can have microbicidal effects. Immunomodulatory effects of galectins include recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. promotion of neutrophil function. and stimulation of the bactericidal activity of infected macrophages. Moreover. intracellular galectins can serve as danger receptors. promoting autophagy of the invading pathogen.

In the alveolar fluid. NTHi is in contact with pulmonary surfactant. a lipoprotein complex that protects the lung against alveolar collapse and constitutes the front line of defense against inhaled pathogens and toxins. Decreased levels of surfactant phospholipids have been reported in smokers and patients with COPD. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of surfactant phospholipids on the host-pathogen interaction between NTHi and pneumocytes. For this purpose. we used two types of surfactant lipid vesicles present in the alveolar fluid: i) multilamellar vesicles (MLVs. > 1 μm diameter). which constitute the tensioactive material of surfactant. and ii) small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs. 0.1 m diameter). which are generated after inspiration/expiration cycles. and are endocytosed by pneumocytes for their degradation and/or recycling. Results indicated that extracellular pulmonary surfactant binds to NTHi. preventing NTHi self-aggregation and inhibiting adhesion of NTHi to pneumocytes and. consequently. inhibiting NTHi invasion. In contrast. endocytosed surfactant lipids. mainly via the scavenger receptor SR-BI. did not affect NTHi adhesion but inhibited NTHi invasion by blocking bacterial uptake in pneumocytes. This blockade was made possible by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation and Rac1 GTPase activation. which are signaling pathways involved in NTHi internalization.

SP-B. SP-C. and SP-D). The two principal surfactant components involved in innate immunity are SP-A and SP-D. The role of surfactant membranes with or without the hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C during infection has been relatively unexplored. Non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is the respiratory pathogen most frequently isolated during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. It causes chronic infections likely due to its capacity to invade and survive within alveolar epithelial cells. In this study we evaluate whether surfactant membranes with or without SP-B and SP-C: i) protect pneumocytes against invasion of NTHi (clinical strains obtained from patients with COPD and otitis media); and ii) limit NTHi infection in vivo. We found that surfactant multilamellar vesicles with or without SP-B and SP-C (MLVs. >1microm) prevented adhesion of NTHi to pneumocytes. Furthermore. endocytosis of surfactant large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs. 100 nm) by pneumocytes inhibited invasion of NTHi clinical strains but not bacterial adhesion to the pneumocyte surface.

Formation of crosslinked networks. eg. bundles. is necessary to achieve the mechanical properties necessary to sustain this vital role. In progenitor basal keratinocytes of the epidermis. intermediate filaments made of keratin 5 (K5) and keratin 14 (K14) exhibit a bundled organization. Recent findings from our laboratory showed that bundle formation can be self-mediated through interactions involving K14's non-helical tail domain and two distinct regions within the central rod domain of K5. Here. we exploit theoretical principles and computational modeling to investigate how these biochemical interactions best promote filament bundling.

1055704,Judging the duration of time intervals: A process of remembering segments of experience,1989,Douglas Poynter,59,,,305-331,North-Holland,This chapter discusses three models of duration judgment. It also compares models in terms of their ability to predict the results of experiments which helps in investigating the effects of interval content on duration judgment. All three models are cognitive (versus biological) explanations. because mechanisms of attention. memory. and information processing play an important role in their logic. Ornstein suggested with his “storage-size” hypothesis that the perceived duration of an interval is based on the contents of memory associated with the judged interval. Ornstein proposed two specific factors that can influence the “size” of memory stores—namely. (1) the amount of information presented during an interval and (2) the complexity of that information. The storage-size model (SS) applies to the estimation of relatively long durations (i.e.. a minute or so).

In Experiment 1. a 170-sec time interval was filled with 27 unrelated words and three high-priority events (HPEs). These HPEs were clustered at the beginning of the interval (unsegmented condition) or distributed throughout the interval (segmented condition). Both recognition and recall of list information were measured. in addition to duration estimates. While no differences in memory performance were found. duration estimates were greater in the the segmented condition. Experiment 2 also tested the effects of interval segmentation but used 36 words and eight HPEs. a longer clock duration. and also measured the remembered number of events (RNE) in the interval.

The first of these presented subjects with stimulus patterns that varied on dimensions of sensory-event number and uncertainty. Subjects estimated the duration of time periods using the reproduction method. Duration estimates were most accurately predicted by the number of sensory events in each pattern. This relationship was generally positive. although the specific function relating these variables was dependent upon clock duration. The change model seemed to fit these data best. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the relationship between sensory change and judged duration was not due to the total time of sensory input.

Attention problems are a common self-reported complaint of veterans with mTBI. but relatively few studies have investigated the types and levels of behavioral attentional deficits present in veterans with mTBI and PTSD. The purpose of this study was to compare visual attentional performance between samples of veterans with both mTBI and PTSD (mTBI+ PTSD). PTSD only. and a control group. Overall. the attentional responses of the mTBI+ PTSD group were slower than those of the PTSD and control groups. The response times were also more variable. suggesting difficulty with attentional vigilance. Additionally. we found evidence of hemispheric asymmetries in attentional performance. Participants with mTBI+ PTSD were less efficient in orienting visual attention to stimuli flashed to the left visual field (LVF). suggesting a right hemisphere deficit.

In addition to its industrial and agricultural importance. the fiber cell (plant trichome) also is a biological model system for exploring gene expression and regulation. Small RNAs regulate many aspects of plant growth and development. However. whether small RNAs are involved in regulation of fiber cell development is unknown. We adopted a deep sequencing approach developed by Solexa (Illumina Inc.) to investigate global expression and complexity of small RNAs during cotton fiber initiation and development. We constructed two small RNA libraries prepared from wild type (WT) and fuzz/lintless (fl Mutant in the WT background) cotton ovules. respectively.

However. expansion of vertebrate 3'UTR functions has required a physical expansion of 3'UTR lengths. complicating the process of detecting nonsense mutations.

PTBP1 blocks the NMD protein UPF1 from binding 3'UTRs. PTBP1 can thus mark specific stop codons as genuine. preserving both the ability of NMD to accurately detect aberrant mRNAs and the capacity of long 3'UTRs to regulate gene expression.

Here. we show that human zinc finger RNA-binding protein (ZFR) represses the interferon response by regulating alternative pre-mRNA splicing. ZFR expression is tightly controlled during macrophage development; monocytes express truncated ZFR isoforms. while macrophages induce full-length ZFR to modulate macrophage-specific alternative splicing. Interferon-stimulated genes are constitutively activated by ZFR depletion. and immunostimulation results in hyper-induction of interferon β (IFNβ/IFNB1).

1055789,A system for coordinated analysis of translational readthrough and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,2017,Stacey L Baker and J Robert Hogg,12,PLoS One,3,e0173980,Public Library of Science,The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons. limiting the expression of potentially deleterious truncated proteins. This activity positions the pathway as a regulator of the severity of genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations. Because many genetic diseases result from nonsense alleles. therapeutics inducing readthrough of premature termination codons and/or inhibition of NMD have been of great interest. Several means of enhancing translational readthrough have been reported to concomitantly inhibit NMD efficiency. but tools for systematic analysis of mammalian NMD inhibition by translational readthrough are lacking. Here. we introduce a system that allows concurrent analysis of translational readthrough and mRNA decay. We use this system to show that diverse readthrough-promoting RNA elements have similar capacities to inhibit NMD. Further. we provide evidence that the level of translational readthrough required for protection from NMD depends on the distance of the suppressed termination codon from the end of the mRNA.,True,L2NdkyUAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,18,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173980,16657653293490283909,/scholar?cites=16657653293490283909,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173980,0,0,0

Here. we report the crystal structure of MoMLV RT in complex with eRF1. The MoMLV RT interacts with the C-terminal domain of eRF1 via its RNase H domain to sterically occlude the binding of peptidyl release factor 3 (eRF3) to eRF1. Promotion of read-through by MoMLV RNase H prevents nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of mRNAs. Comparison of our structure with that of HIV RT explains why HIV RT cannot interact with eRF1.

We show that in vitro translation of purified mRNPs is much more efficient than that achieved using standard IVT mRNA substrates and is compatible with physiological ionic conditions. The high efficiency of affinity-purified mRNP in vitro translation is attributable to both copurified protein components and proper mRNA processing and modification.

Due to the major role of NMD in RNA quality control and gene expression regulation. it is important to understand how the pathway responds to changing cellular conditions. Here we show that an alternative mammalian-specific isoform of the core NMD factor UPF1. termed UPF1LL. enables condition-dependent remodeling of NMD specificity. UPF1LL associates more stably with potential NMD target mRNAs than the major UPF1SL isoform. expanding the scope of NMD to include many transcripts normally immune to the pathway. Unexpectedly. the enhanced persistence of UPF1LL on mRNAs supports induction of NMD in response to rare translation termination events. Thus. while canonical NMD is abolished by translational repression. UPF1LL activity is enhanced. providing a mechanism to rapidly rewire NMD specificity in response to cellular stress.,True,L2NdkyUAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.428318v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/01/27/2021.01.27.428318.full.pdf,0,0,0

Methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme that can remove O6-methyl guanine adducts prior to the development of catastrophic mutations. and is associated with TMZ resistance. However. inhibition of MGMT fails to reverse TMZ resistance. Guanines are essential nucleotides in many DNA and RNA secondary structures. In several neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). disruption of these secondary structures is pathogenic. We therefore took a structural view of TMZ resistance. seeking to establish the role of guanine mutations in disrupting critical nucleotide secondary structures. To test whether these have functional impacts on TMZ-resistant GBM. we focused on two specific guanine-rich regions: G-quadruplexes (G4s) and splice sites.

An Ala25Thr (A25T) polymorphism in Cys C has been associated with both macular degeneration and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Previously. studies have suggested that this polymorphism may compromise the secretion of Cys C. Interestingly. we found that untagged A25T. A25T tagged C-terminally with FLAG. or A25T FLAG followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP). were all secreted as efficiently from immortalized human cells as their wild-type (WT) counterparts (e.g.. 112%. 100%. and 88% of WT levels from HEK-293T cells. respectively). Supporting these observations. WT and A25T Cys C variants also showed similar intracellular steady state levels. Furthermore. A25T Cys C did not activate the unfolded protein response and followed the same canonical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi trafficking pathway as WT Cys C. WT Cys C has been shown to undergo signal sequence cleavage between residues Gly26 and Ser27.

WT and A25T Cys C have the same signal sequence cleavage site after Gly26 (referred to as ‘site 2’ cleavage).

In bottom-up proteomics peptides are mapped back to proteins and proteoforms to describe a proteome; however. accurate quantitation of proteoforms is challenging due to incomplete protein sequence coverage and mapping ambiguities.

This study focused on developing and using an assay that can quickly and easily detect mutant MYOC secretion.Methods: We fused Gaussia luciferase (eGLuc2) to MYOC variants and expressed the constructs in HEK-293T and NTM-5 cells. Secreted and intracellular levels of MYOC eGLuc2 variants were evaluated by Western blotting and compared to untagged and FLAG-tagged MYOC constructs. Secreted and soluble intracellular MYOC eGLuc2 were measured by a GLuc assay. The secretion of nine additional MYOC mutants was assayed in conditioned media from transfected cells to test the applicability of the assay for monitoring other MYOC variants.Results: Myocilin eGLuc2 behaved similarly to untagged and FLAG-tagged MYOC with respect to secretion. soluble intracellular levels. and in response to drug treatment. The GLuc assay could sensitively detect Y437H MYOC secretion 30 minutes after media change. Gaussia luciferase fused variants followed anticipated trends; nonpathogenic variants (D208E. G244V) were secreted at wild-type (WT) levels. whereas predicted disease-causing variants (C245Y. G246R. E300K. Y437H. I477N) demonstrated substantial secretion defects. Secretion defects caused by the C245Y. G246R. and Y437H mutations were partially rescued by permissive growth temperature.

P19 dimers appropriate 21-nucleotide (nt) duplex short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by Dicer presumably to prevent programming of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In the context of virus infection. this model predicts that P19 mutants compromised for siRNA binding cannot prevent RISC-mediated degradation of TBSV RNA and thus reduce viral pathogenicity. To test this. we used P19/43 (R→W). which is less pathogenic than wild-type P19 (wtP19). and P19/75-78 (RR→GG). with pathogenicity properties (i.e.. viral spread and symptom induction) comparable to those of a P19-null mutant.

NJ,RNA interference (RNAi) plays multiple biological roles in eukaryotic organisms to regulate gene expression. RNAi also operates as a conserved adaptive molecular immune mechanism against invading viruses. The antiviral RNAi pathway is initiated with the generation of virus-derived short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are used for subsequent sequence-specific recognition and degradation of the cognate viral RNA molecules. As an efficient counter-defensive strategy. most plant viruses evolved the ability to encode specific proteins capable of interfering with RNAi. and this process is commonly known as RNA silencing suppression. Virus-encoded suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) operate at different steps in the RNAi pathway and display distinct biochemical properties that enable these proteins to efficiently interfere with the host-defense system.

Roots of ammonium‐grown barley plants exhibited considerable levels of AO2. AO3. and AO4 activities after native PAGE. Significantly lower AO2 and AO3 activity bands were observed in roots of plants grown on nitrate. When abscisic aldehyde was used as a substrate a strong response of the AO2 band was observed as well as a faint reaction of the AO3 band. but no activity of AO4 was observed using this substrate.

We show that infection of Nicotiana benthamiana with Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) activates an antiviral nuclease that specifically cleaves TRV RNA in vitro. In agreement with known RISC properties. the nuclease activity was inhibited by NaCl and EDTA and stimulated by divalent metal cations; a novel property was its preferential targeting of elongated RNA molecules. Intriguingly. the specificity of the TRV RISC could be reprogrammed by exogenous addition of RNA (containing siRNAs) from plants infected with an unrelated virus. resulting in a newly acquired ability of RISC to target this heterologous genome in vitro.

In addition. RNAi was shown to be an adaptive protective molecular immune mechanism against viral diseases. Antiviral RNAi initiates from generation of short interfering RNAs used in the subsequent recognition and degradation of the viral RNA molecules. As a response to protective reaction of plants. most of the viruses encode specific proteins able to counteract RNAi. This process is known as RNAi suppression. Viral suppressors act on various stages of RNAi and have biochemical properties that enable viruses to effectively counteract the protective system of plants.

The regulation of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of phytochelatins is. therefor. of considerable importance in the process of heavy metal accumulation. We have concentrated our research on two sulfurylases:(a) OASTL. the O-acetylserine-thiol-lyase which introduces S into O-acetylserine to yield cystein and (b) MHS. the Mo-hydroxylase sulfurylase which is required to introduce S replacing one of the two oxygen ligands of dioxo-MoCo. the Mo-cofactor of most Mo-enzymes in plants and other organism. The sulfurylation of dioxo Mo in aldehyde oxidase (AO) and xanthin dehydrogenase (XDH) is required for the activarion of these two enzymes. Cystein is a basic precursor of glutathion and phytochelatins. while aldehyde oxidase is the enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of abscisic aldehyde (ABald) to yield the stress plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) as well as the oxidation of indole-acetaldehyde (IAald) to indole-acetic acid (IAA).

The diversity of ubiquitin modifications can be attributed to the variable number of ubiquitin molecules attached to a lysine residue (mono- vs. poly-ubiquitin chains). the type of covalent linkages within poly-ubiquitin chains and the number of lysine residues on a substrate that are occupied by ubiquitin at any given time. The integral role ubiquitination plays in cell homeostasis is reflected by the multitude of diseases associated with impaired ubiquitin modification. rendering it the focus of extensive research initiatives and proteomic discovery studies. However. determining the functional role of distinct ubiquitin modifications directly from proteomic data remains challenging and represents a bottleneck in the process of deciphering how ubiquitination at specific substrate sites impacts cell signaling. In this study SILAC coupled with LC–MS/MS is used to identify ubiquitinated proteins in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. with the implementation of a computational approach that measures relative ubiquitin occupancy at distinct modification sites upon 26S proteasome inhibition and uses that data to infer functional significance.

Here we find that at single cell level. IL-2 is binary (digital) and CD25 is graded expressed whereas at population level both parameters show graded expression correlating with the antigen amount. Combining in vivo data with a mathematical model we demonstrate that only this binary IL-2 expression ensures a wide linear antigen response range for Teff and Treg cells under real spatiotemporal conditions. Furthermore. at low antigen concentrations binary IL-2 expression safeguards by its spatial distribution selective STAT5 activation only of closely adjacent Treg cells regardless of their antigen specificity.

Deletion of Cdc42 in T cells enhanced Th17 differentiation but diminished induced Treg differentiation and suppressive function. Treg-specific deletion of Cdc42 decreased natural Tregs but increased effector T cells including Th17 cells. Notably. Cdc42-deficient Th17 cells became pathogenic associated with enhanced glycolysis and Cdc42-deficient Tregs became unstable associated with weakened glycolytic signaling. Inhibition of glycolysis in Cdc42-deficient Th17 cells diminished their pathogenicity and restoration of glycolysis in Cdc42-deficient Tregs rescued their instability. Intriguingly.

Here. we show that CASIN. a selective inhibitor of Cdc42 GTPase. inhibited proliferation and survival of Melphalan/Bortezomib-resistant MM cells more profoundly than that on Melphalan/Bortezomib-sensitive cells. And CASIN was more potent than Melphalan/Bortezomib in inhibition of Melphalan/Bortezomib-resistant cells. In addition. CASIN sensitized Melphalan/Bortezomib-resistant cells to Melphalan/Bortezomib. Mechanistically. Cdc42 activity was higher in Melphalan/Bortezomib-resistant cells than that in Melphalan/Bortezomib-sensitive cells. CASIN inhibited monoubiquitination of FANCD2 of the Fanconi anemia DNA damage repair pathway in Melphalan-resistant cells. but not in Melphalan-sensitive cells. sensitizing Melphalan-resistant cells to DNA damage.

1056011,The role of immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 in modulating T-helper cell differentiation and progression of autoimmune diseases,2013,Khalid Wasim Kalim,,,,,,The Proteasome is the central proteolytic machinery in cells. which plays an important role in antigen processing. The processing of the antigens is done by the catalytic active sites present in the inner-ring of the 20S core subunit of the proteasome. These active sites are responsible for the generation of ligands that can be loaded on MHC class I molecule and presented to T-cells for mounting an immune response. The inner-ring harbours six catalytic active sites-two copies each of 1. 2. and 5. which are responsible for caspase-like. trypsin-like. and chymotrypsin-like activity. In the cells of the haematopoietic origin like lymphocytes and monocytes. these constitutive proteasome subunits are replaced by the immunoproteasome subunits designated as 1i (LMP2). 2i (MECL) and 5i (LMP7) which causes a marked change in their cleavage preferance and efficient processing of MHC-I ligands. This thesis identified a novel role of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 in the progression of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and colitis. We also looked into the molecular details of this novel finding focussing on transcription factors and regulatory proteins especially with respect to different T-helper cell differentiation pathways like Th1. Th17. and Tregs. which are involved in the progression of autoimmune diseases. We also studied the role of the non-cytokine immunomodulator prostaglandin E2 in the production of key cytokines involved in different T-helper cell differentiation pathways.

ONX 0914 (formerly called PR-957) is a selective inhibitor of the immunoproteasome subunit low molecular mass polypeptide (LMP) 7 (b5i) that attenuates disease progression in mouse models of diabetes. colitis. and arthritis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of LMP7-specific inhibition on major Th cell differentiation pathways involved in the progression of autoimmune diseases in vitro and in vivo. We used ONX 0914-treated wild-type CD4+ T cells and also LMP7 2/2 CD4+ T cells under different Th cell-polarizing conditions. focusing on the effector cytokines and transcription factors involved. and compared them with wild-type CD4+ T cells. Mouse models of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis and a T cell transfer model of colitis were used for in vivo assessment. Deletion or inhibition of LMP7 suppressed generation of Th17 but promoted regulatory T cell (Treg) development. In developing Th17 cells. immunoproteasome inhibition blocked phosphorylation of STAT3. whereas in Tregs. SMAD phosphorylation was enhanced. Additionally. LMP7 inhibition led to reduced STAT1 phosphorylation and Th1 differentiation. These findings were confirmed in vivo as LMP7 inhibition or deficiency resulted in reduced Th1 and Th17 expansion while promoting Treg development in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Also. in a T cell-dependent transfer model of colitis. LMP7-specific inhibition led to reduced Th1 and Th17 differentiation in vivo.

Neurodegenerative amyloidoses are major health issues in Western society. but there are no effective therapies to prevent or cure many of these disorders. with treatments concentrating on improving symptoms.[1] An appealing therapeutic strategy is to target aggregating proteins with small molecules that inhibit self-association into toxic oligomeric intermediates and mature fibrillar species.[2. 3] One such approach is to synthesise short (3–8 residue) peptides that correspond to a self-recognition element (SRE) within the target sequence that drives fibril growth by assembling into one or more β-sheet layers constituting the fibril core. The peptides contain subtle modifications so that they can hydrogen-bond to the self-recognition site of the parent protein and block aggregation.[4–6] Modifications include βsheet-breaking amino acid (for example. proline) substitutions.[7] N-methylated amino acids.[8] addition of N-and C-terminal blocking or disrupting groups.[9] replacement of amide bonds with ester linkages and introduction of α-disubstituted amino acids.[2] In primary screens several modified SRE peptides are effective at preventing protein aggregation and reducing cellular toxicity in vitro. and have also recently been shown to recover cognitive performance in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease.[10. 11] Nevertheless. none has yet progressed to the clinic. and consequently new inhibitory agents continue to be sought.

Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) is a useful high-resolution technique for the structural analysis of small molecule or peptide ligands when bound to receptors. SSNMR-derived constraints on the molecular conformations of isotopically (e.g.. 13C and 15N) enriched ligands usually take the form of through-space distances between atomic nuclei that are separated by three or more bonds.

Rumex species have been recognized as a promising source of new compounds with numerous pharmacological activities. Therefore. the antioxidant activity of Rumex tingitanus (R. tingitanus) leaves extracts was evaluated in vitro and then confirmed in vivo as well as the antidepressant-like and toxicological effects of the extracts. The ethyl acetate fraction (Rt EtOAcF) followed by hydroalcoholic extract (Rt EtOH-H2O) showed a remarkable in vitro antioxidant activity. The hydroalcoholic extract (Rt EtOH-H2O) showed significant hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride- (CCl4-) induced liver toxicity which is seen from inhibition of the malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation and enhancement of the liver antioxidant enzymes activities. The Rt EtOH-H2O and Rt EtOAcF extracts were able to reduce the immobility time in mice and then elicited a significant antidepressant-like effect.

Thiopeptides (or more formally thiazolyl peptides) are a class of thiazole-containing. highly modified. macrocyclic secondary metabolites made from ribosomally synthesized precursor peptides. The characteristic feature of these natural products is a six-membered nitrogenous heterocycle that is assembled via a formal [4+2] cycloaddition between two dehydroalanine (Dha) residues.

Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a diverse natural product class that employs a biosynthetic logic that is highly amenable to engineering new compounds. RiPP biosynthetic proteins modify their substrates by binding to a motif typically located in the N-terminal leader region of the precursor peptide. Here. we exploit this feature by designing leader peptides that enable recognition and processing by multiple enzymes from unrelated RiPP pathways.

Annually. over 17 million people succumb to bacterial infections. with an increasing proportion due to antibiotic resistance. Therefore. there is urgent and continuous need for new antibiotics. Small molecule metabolites from microbes have been a highly productive source of chemical matter that ultimately led to most of today’s clinically used antibiotics. Many of these natural products are derived from polyketide synthase (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) families. including well-known antibiotics such as the beta-lactams. tetracyclines. macrolides. and glycopeptides. With the rising resistance to these proven antibiotic classes. alternative sources of antibiotics must be discovered.

We show that RcsF has a transmembrane topology with the lipidated N terminus on the cell surface and the C-terminal signaling domain in the periplasm. Strikingly. the short. unstructured. charged transmembrane domain is threaded through the lumen of β-barrel OM proteins where it is protected from the hydrophobic membrane interior. We present evidence that these unusual complexes. which contain one protein inside another. are formed by the Bam complex that assembles all β-barrel proteins in the OM.

1056268,Outer membrane lipoprotein biogenesis: Lol is not the end,2015,Anna Konovalova and Thomas J Silhavy,370,,1679,20150030,The Royal Society,Bacterial lipoproteins are lipid-anchored proteins that contain acyl groups covalently attached to the N-terminal cysteine residue of the mature protein. Lipoproteins are synthesized in precursor form with an N-terminal signal sequence (SS) that targets translocation across the cytoplasmic or inner membrane (IM). Lipid modification and SS processing take place at the periplasmic face of the IM. Outer membrane (OM) lipoproteins take the localization of lipoproteins (Lol) export pathway. which ends with the insertion of the N-terminal lipid moiety into the inner leaflet of the OM. For many lipoproteins. the biogenesis pathway ends here. We provide examples of lipoproteins that adopt complex topologies in the OM that include transmembrane and surface-exposed domains.

RcsF exists in complexes with β-barrel proteins (OMPs) allowing it to adopt a transmembrane orientation with a lipidated N-terminal domain on the cell surface and a periplasmic C-terminal domain. Here we report that mutations that remove BamE or alter a residue in the RcsF trans-lumen domain specifically prevent assembly of the interlocked complexes without inactivating either RcsF or the OMP. Using these mutations we demonstrate that these RcsF/OMP complexes are required for sensing OM outer leaflet stress. Using mutations that alter the positively charged surface-exposed domain. we show that RcsF monitors lateral interactions between lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules. When these interactions are disrupted by cationic antimicrobial peptides. or by the loss of negatively charged phosphate groups on the LPS molecule. this information is transduced to the RcsF C-terminal signaling domain located in the periplasm to activate the stress response.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15276.001,True,PKny7wcAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,66,https://elifesciences.org/articles/15276,8425929662094417979,/scholar?cites=8425929662094417979,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/15276.pdf,0,0,0

These species play a key role in oxidative stress. leading to the development and progression of many disorders. including hypertension. cancer. diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. This study estimated the levels of serum antioxidant vitamins and Malondialdehyde (MDA) as evidence of lipid peroxidation. Healthy male smokers aged 15-35years from Usmanu Danfodiyo University Sokoto community who consume at least five sticks of cigarette/day were recruited for the study. Serum Antioxidant vitamins (A.

Pretreatment and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass are crucial steps in bioethanol production. Our study determined the efficiency of three pretreatment techniques namely water. alkaline. and acidic pretreatments on the production of bioethanol. We applied the same hydrolysis technique using H2SO4 to all the pretreatment techniques. Our results showed highest reducing sugar concentrations when banana peels were pretreated with acid; pretreatment using water alone gave the lowest reducing sugar concentrations. We used an activated strain of S. cerevisiae to convert the reducing sugars to bioethanol via a three-day fermentation process. The bioethanol concentrations detected by GC-FID from the water. acidic. and alkaline pretreatments were 40 ppm. 60 ppm. and 80 ppm respectively.

1056324,The effect of temperature. turbulence. and Ph on the solubility of MTBE,2016,Gaddafi I Danmaliki and Abdullahi A Shamsuddeen and Bashir J Usman,3,European Journal of Earth and Environment Vol,2,,,Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) is a fuel oxygenate whose discharge is inevitable in the environment. consequently posing serious health and environmental effects. The solubility of this volatile organic compound (VOC) has not been studied extensively. the few studies available present contrasting views. This study used a spectrophotometer to determine the effects of pH (5. 7 & 9). mixing rate (400 rpm & 600 rpm). and time (1 hour) on the solubility of MTBE in water. We calculated the max and the molar absorptivity of MTBE as 190 nm and 167 M-cm-respectively. MTBE spiked at pH 9 gave the highest absorbance. while the results obtained at pH 5 gave the lowest absorbance. However. MTBE spiked at pH 7 was more soluble and relatively stable. A low mixing rate of 400 rpm enhanced the solubility of MTBE indicating that turbulence reduces the solubility of MTBE in water. Moreover. our results indicate that low temperature enhances the solubility of MTBE. The solubility of MTBE at 25 C using a mixing rate of 400 rpm and 600 rpm was 0.08 g/L and 0.044 g/L respectively.

In addition to its contribution to form particulate pollution. sulfur emission may cause some health problems. Regarding the negative impact of sulfur in industry. small amount of sulfur may poison the catalysts or diminish its efficiency. A commonly used method for the removal of sulfur-bearing species from fuel is hydrodesulphurization. However. due to the regulations required removal of sulfur to very low levels. several alternative technologies have also been reported for sulfur removal from liquids such as catalytic oxidation. biological sulfur removal and membrane separation.

AIDS. depression. Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Electrochemical biosensors based on enzyme inhibition are useful devices for an easy. fast and environment friendly monitoring of inhibitors like drugs. In the last decades. electrochemical biosensors have shown great potentials in the detection of different drugs like neostigmine. ketoconazole. donepezil. allopurinol and many others. They attracted increasing attention due to the advantage of being high sensitive and accurate analytical tools. able to reach low detection limits and the possibility to be performed on real samples. This review will spotlight the research conducted in the past 10 years (2007–2017) on inhibition based enzymatic electrochemical biosensors for the analysis of different drugs. New assays based on novel bio-devices will be debated. Moreover. the exploration of the recent graphical approach in diagnosis of reversible and irreversible inhibition mechanism will be discussed. The accurate and the fast diagnosis of inhibition type will help researchers in further drug design improvements and the identification of new molecules that will serve as new enzyme targets.

Res. Microbiol. Biotechnol,,133-142,,Trichoderma is a genus of asexually reproducing filamentous fungi and widely distributed in the soil. plant material. decaying vegetation and wood. The antagonistic properties of Trichoderma are based on the activation of multiple mechanisms. Trichoderma strains act as bio-control agents against fungal phytopathogens either indirectly or directly. Indirect mechanism comprises competition for nutrients and space. modification of the environmental conditions. antibiosis and induction of plant defensive mechanisms. however direct mechanism encompasses mycoparasitism. Some bio-control agents use only one of these strategies but the most successful bio-control agents like Trichoderma use several of them. These indirect and direct mechanisms may act coordinately and their importance in the bio-control process depends on the Trichoderma strain. the antagonized fungus. the crop plant. and the environmental conditions including nutrient availability. pH. temperature and iron concentration. Activation of each mechanism implies the production of specific compounds and metabolites such as plant growth factors. pathogenesis related lytic enzymes. siderophores. antibiotics. and carbon and nitrogen permeases.

There are 115 species in the Coffea genus. but only two. C. arabica and C. canephora. are commercially cultivated. Coffee plants are attacked by many pathogens and insect-pests. which affect not only the production of coffee but also its grain quality. reducing the commercial value of the product. The main insect-pest. the coffee berry borer (Hypotheneumus hampei). is responsible for worldwide annual losses of around US$500 million. The coffee berry borer exclusively damages the coffee berries. and it is mainly controlled by organochlorine insecticides that are both toxic and carcinogenic. Unfortunately. natural resistance in the genus Coffea to H. hampei has not been documented. To overcome these problems. biotechnological strategies can be used to introduce an α-amylase inhibitor gene (α-AI1). which confers resistance against the coffee berry borer insect-pest. into C. arabica plants. We transformed C. arabica with the α-amylase inhibitor-1 gene (α-AI1) from the common bean. Phaseolus vulgaris. under control of the seed-specific phytohemagglutinin promoter (PHA-L). The presence of the α-AI1 gene in six regenerated transgenic T1 coffee plants was identified by PCR and Southern blotting. Immunoblotting and ELISA experiments using antibodies against α-AI1 inhibitor showed a maximum α-AI1 concentration of 0.29% in crude seed extracts.

Digestion of cellulose and other polysaccharides in plant-based diets requires several types of enzymes including a number of glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. In a previous study. we showed that a single GH45 gene is present in the midgut tissue of the western corn rootworm. Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). However. the presence of multiple enzymes was also suggested by the lack of a significant biological response when the expression of the gene was silenced by RNA interference. In order to clarify the repertoire of cellulose-degrading enzymes and related GH family proteins in D. v. virgifera. we performed next-generation sequencing and assembled transcriptomes from the tissue of three different developmental stages (eggs. neonates. and third instar larvae). Results of this study revealed the presence of seventy-eight genes that potentially encode GH enzymes belonging to eight families (GH45. GH48. GH28. GH16. GH31. GH27. GH5. and GH1). The numbers of GH45 and GH28 genes identified in D. v. virgifera are among the largest in insects where these genes have been identified. Three GH family genes (GH45. GH48. and GH28) are found almost exclusively in two coleopteran superfamilies (Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea) among insects. indicating the possibility of their acquisitions by horizontal gene transfer rather than simple vertical transmission from ancestral lineages of insects.

Velez and Elane Fishilevich and Haichuan Wang and Newton P. Carneiro and Arnubio Valencia-Jimenez and Fernando H. Valicente and Kenneth E. Narva and Blair D. Siegfried,13,Plos One,8,1-19,Juan Luis Jurat-Fuentes. University of Tennessee. UNITED STATES,The cellular uptake of dsRNA after dietary exposure is critical for RNAi efficiency; however. the mechanism of its uptake in many insects remains to be understood. In this study. we evaluated the roles of the endocytic pathway genes Clathrin heavy chain (Chc). Clathrin adaptor protein AP50. ADP ribosylation factor-like 1 (Arf72A). Vacuolar H+ ATPase 16 kDa subunit (Vha16). and small GTPase Rab7 and putative sid-1-like genes (silA and silC) in RNAi response in western corn rootworm (WCR) using a two-stage dsRNA exposure bioassay. Silencing of Chc. Vha16. and AP50 led to a significant decrease in the effects of laccase2 dsRNA reporter. indicating that these genes are involved in RNAi response. However. the knockdown of either Arf72A or Rab7 did not suppress the response to laccase2 dsRNA. The silencing of the silC gene did not lead to a significant reduction in mortality or increase in the expression of V-ATPase A reporter. While the silencing of the silA gene significantly decreased insect mortality. significant changes in V-ATPase A expression were not detected. These results suggest that clathrin-dependent endocytosis is a biological mechanism that plays an important role during RNAi response in WCR adults. The fact that no definitive support for the roles of silA or silC in RNAi response was obtained support the idea that RNAi response varies greatly in different insect species. demanding additional studies focused on elucidating their involvement in this mechanism.,True,Gc8JgGAAAAAJ:j7XjBeKFbTsC,15,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201849,9660119063278170707,/scholar?cites=9660119063278170707,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201849,0,0,0

1056530,Resistance Gene Analogues as a Tool for Rapid Identification and Cloning of Disease Resistance Genes in Plants 3 A Review,2009,TR Sharma and Alok Das and SP Kumar and ML Lodha,18,,1,1-11,Springer India,Most of the disease resistance genes (R-genes) discovered in plants have conserved functional domains. predominantly among them are nucleotide binding sites (NBS) and leucine rich repeats (LRR). The sequence information of the conserved domains can be invariably used to mine similar sequences from other plant species. using degenerate and specific primers for their amplification in a polymerase chain reaction. Such derived sequences. known as Resistance Gene Analogues (RGAs). can serve as molecular markers for rapid identification and isolation of R-genes. Besides. they can also provide clues about the evolutionary mechanism of resistance genes and the interaction involved in pathogen recognition. In the recent years. this sequence-homology based approach has been used extensively for the cloning and mapping of RGAs in cereals. pulses. oilseeds. coffee. spices. forest trees and …,True,HUGTAb4AAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,33,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF03263289.pdf,17191234997228186047,/scholar?cites=17191234997228186047,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF03263289.pdf,0,0,0

Inhibitors that selectively target apicoplast housekeeping functions. including DNA replication and protein translation. are lethal for the parasite. and several (doxycycline. clindamycin. and azithromycin) are in clinical use as antimalarials. A major limitation of such drugs is that treated parasites only arrest one intraerythrocytic development cycle (approximately 48 hours) after treatment commences. a phenotype known as the ‘delayed death’ effect. The molecular basis of delayed death is a long-standing mystery in parasitology. and establishing the mechanism would aid rational clinical implementation of apicoplast-targeted drugs.

Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that disordered loops. which are not resolved in the crystal structure. extend from the PfPA28 heptamer and surround the pore. Using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. we solved the structure of Pf20S in complex with one and two regulatory PfPA28 caps at resolutions of 3.9 and 3.8 …,True,k7mXwhoAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,13,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0524-4,17365439397051738609,/scholar?cites=17365439397051738609,,http://bs6vx4ge6d.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&auinit=SC&aulast=Xie&atitle=The+structure+of+the+PA28%E2%80%9320S+proteasome+complex+from+Plasmodium+falciparum+and+implications+for+proteostasis&id=doi:10.1038/s41564-019-0524-4&title=Nature+microbiology&volume=4&issue=11&date=2019&spage=1990&issn=2058-5276,0,0,0

Early evidence suggested that actinonin inhibited prokaryote-like post-translational modification in the apicoplast; mimicking its activity against bacteria. However. Amberg Johnson et al. (2017) identified the metalloprotease TgFtsH1 as the target of actinonin in the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii and implicated P. falciparum FtsH1 as a likely target in malaria parasites. The authors were not. however. able to recover actinonin resistant malaria parasites. leaving the specific target of actinonin uncertain. We generated actinonin resistant P. falciparum by in vitro selection and identified a specific sequence change in PfFtsH1 associated with resistance. Introduction of this point mutation using CRISPr-Cas9 allelic replacement was sufficient to confer actinonin resistance in P. falciparum. Our data unequivocally identify PfFtsH1 as the target of actinonin and suggests that actinonin should not be included in the highly valuable collection of ‘irresistible’ drugs for combatting malaria.,True,k7mXwhoAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://elifesciences.org/articles/58629,,,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/58629.pdf,0,0,0

1056622,Na⁺ regulation in the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite,2011,Natalie Jane Spillman,,,,,The Australian National University,The maintenance of a low intracellular [Na⁺] ([Na⁺]i) is a crucial aspect of cellular physiology.  In mammalian cells this is achieved through the extrusion of Na⁺ via the well-characterised  Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase. Approximately 12 hr after invasion of the human erythrocyte by the malaria parasite there is a profound increase in the permeability of the erythrocyte membrane to a wide range of solutes. including Na⁺.  Na⁺ enters the infected erythrocyte via parasite-induced 'New Permeability Pathways' and there is. as a result. an increase in [Na⁺] in the erythrocyte compartment. with [Na⁺]i eventually reaching levels similar to those in the extra erythrocytic plasma (~130 mM).  The parasite itself maintains a low [Na⁺]i. The resulting large inwardly-directed  electrochemical  Na⁺ gradient across the parasite plasma membrane energises the accumulation within the parasite of at least one essential nutrient (inorganic phosphate). The aim of this thesis was to characterise the mechanisms involved in Na⁺ regulation in the mature asexual 'trophozoite' stage of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.  The Na⁺-sensitive. fluorescent dye Sodium-binding BenzoFuran Isophthalate (SBFI) was used to measure [Na⁺]i in parasites functionally isolated from their host cells by saponin-permeabilisation of the host erythrocyte membrane. Under physiologically relevant conditions the resting [Na⁺]i in isolated trophozoites was estimated to be ~11 mM. Maintenance  of [Na⁺]i was sensitive to the P-type ATPase inhibitor orthovanadate. consistent with Na⁺ extrusion being via a P-type Na⁺-ATPase. similar to the ENA (exitus natru; exit of sodium)-type ATPases …,True,k7mXwhoAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/109806,,,,https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/109806/4/b28789477-Spillman_N_2011.pdf,0,0,0

The normal cellular function of ataxin-2 and the mechanism by which polyglutamine expansion of ataxin-2 causes neurodegeneration remain unknown. In this study we have used genetic and molecular approaches to investigate the function of a Drosophila homolog of the SCA2 gene (Datx2). Like human ataxin-2. Datx2 is found throughout development in a variety of tissue types and localizes to the cytoplasm.

New York. NY,As a cell differentiates into a more specialized cell. it alters the pattern of expression of a subset of genes. Regulation of expression of these genes can occur at almost any point along the pathway from DNA to protein. The most common method that cells use to express specialized genes is to regulate the level of transcription of these genes (1). Combinations of transcription-enhancing and -repressing DNA binding factors can determine the level of expression of certain gene products. These differentiated cell-specific DNA binding factors bind to a defined sequence in the promoter of an expressed gene and somehow interact with the basal transcription machinery to affect the level of expression (2. 3). Knowing this. a simple model for differentiation of a cell may be hypothesized. It may be predicted that each of the genes to be expressed in a differentiated cell contains a single-factor binding site that activates …,True,-N-rtjEAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-8386-4_6,16936096198030688627,/scholar?cites=16936096198030688627,,,0,0,0

We find that cholesterol is not just necessary but also sufficient to activate signaling by the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. a prominent cell-cell communication system in development. Cholesterol influences Hh signaling by directly activating Smoothened (SMO). an orphan GPCR that transmits the Hh signal across the membrane in all animals. Unlike many GPCRs. which are regulated by cholesterol through their heptahelical transmembrane domains. SMO is activated by cholesterol through its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Residues shown to mediate cholesterol binding to the CRD in a recent structural analysis also dictate SMO activation. both in response to cholesterol and to native Hh ligands. Our results show that cholesterol can initiate signaling from the cell surface by engaging the extracellular domain of a GPCR and suggest that SMO activity may be regulated by local changes in cholesterol abundance or accessibility.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20304.001,True,_BGYK2YAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,120,https://elifesciences.org/articles/20304,326479099014541943,/scholar?cites=326479099014541943,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/20304.pdf,0,0,0

But how is cholesterol. an abundant lipid. regulated tightly enough to control a signaling system that can cause birth defects and cancer? Using toxin-based sensors that distinguish between distinct pools of cholesterol. we find that Smoothened activation and hedgehog signaling are driven by a biochemically-defined. small fraction of membrane cholesterol. termed accessible cholesterol. Increasing cholesterol accessibility by depletion of sphingomyelin. which sequesters cholesterol in complexes. amplifies hedgehog signaling. Hedgehog ligands increase cholesterol accessibility in the membrane of the primary cilium by inactivating the transporter-like protein Patched 1.

Here we show that two genes previously implicated in CHDs. Megf8 and Mgrn1. interact genetically and biochemically to regulate the strength of Hedgehog signaling in target cells. MEGF8. a single-pass transmembrane protein. and MGRN1. a RING superfamily E3 ligase. assemble to form a transmembrane ubiquitin ligase complex that catalyzes the ubiquitination and degradation of the Hedgehog pathway transducer Smoothened. Homozygous Megf8 and Mgrn1 mutations increased Smoothened abundance and elevated sensitivity to Hedgehog ligands. While mice heterozygous for loss-of-function Megf8 or Mgrn1 mutations were normal. double heterozygous embryos exhibited an incompletely penetrant syndrome of CHDs with heterotaxy. Thus. genetic interactions between components of a receptor-like ubiquitin ligase complex that tunes morphogen signaling strength can cause a birth defect syndrome inherited in an oligogenic pattern.,True,_BGYK2YAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.25.113944v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/05/26/2020.05.25.113944.full.pdf,0,0,0

1056799,Exploring Roles of Notch and Sonic Hedgehog Signaling in the Developing Central Nervous System,2015,Jennifer Haruko Kong,,,,,,The central nervous system (CNS) is a very complex and highly organized structure. In the beginning the CNS is a sheet of cells. Over time external cues encourage this sheet to become a tube and from this tube an abundance of cell types are generated. These cells then migrate out. establish contacts with other cells. and form functional circuits. Given the complexity of the CNS. one of the fundamental goals of developmental neurobiology is to understand how this wealth of cellular diversity is generated and organized given the initial guidance of just a few signaling cues. Through the work of many groups. the emerging solution to this unbalanced equation appears to be signaling pathway interactions. To address this we focused our study on the roles and interactions of two major developmental signaling pathways: Notch and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). In the developing CNS. the major role of Notch signaling is progenitor maintenance and the major role of Shh signaling is progenitor patterning. However. when studied together. we observed that Notch signaling was able to modulate a progenitor cell’s response to Shh and in doing so influenced cell fate choices made within the developing spinal cord. Interested in these initial findings. we wanted to study other functions of Notch signaling. In a second study we observed that interactions between Notch and retinoic acid (RA) signaling contributed to neuronal diversity within the caudal hindbrain and rostral spinal cord.  Then. in a third study. we observed that Notch signaling maintained apical cell contacts within the developing brain. Collectively. this work illustrates that. within the context of neural …,True,_BGYK2YAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4x8493xs,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt4x8493xs/qt4x8493xs.pdf,0,0,0

To elucidate further the structural and functional role of this enzyme. the phenotypic effects of down-regulating SBEIIb expression in rice endosperm were characterized by artificial microRNA (amiRNA) and hairpin RNA (hp-RNA) gene silencing. The results showed that RNA silencing of SBEIIb expression in rice grains did not affect the expression of other major isoforms of starch branching enzymes or starch synthases.

Fused granule agglomerates isolated from mutant and transgenic lines were hydrolysed at similar rates by amylases. and had similar crystalline patterns and thermal properties as individual granules. Surface pores. a feature previously only reported for A-polymorphic starch granules. were also observed in B- and C-polymorphic rice starch granules. Although the microscopic patterns of hydrolysis among granules with different crystalline polymorphs were qualitatively similar. the extent and the rate of amylolysis were different. suggesting that B-type crystalline polymorphs are intrinsically more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis than A-type in rice starch granules.

We therefore wished to investigate the relationship between bacterial durability and glycogen ACL by varying glycogen average chain length in a single species. It has been shown that progressive shortening of the N-terminus of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) leads to a lengthening of oligosaccharide inter-α-1.6-glycosidic chain lengths. so we sought to harness this to create a set of Escherichia coli DH5α strains with a range of glycogen average chain lengths. and assess these strains for durability related attributes. such as starvation. cold and desiccation stress resistance. and biofilm formation. A series of Escherichia coli DH5α mutants were created with glgB genes that were in situ progressively N-terminus truncated. N-terminal truncation shifted the distribution of glycogen chain lengths from 5-11 DP toward 13-50 DP. but the relationship between glgB length and glycogen ACL was not linear. Surprisingly. removal of the first 270 nucleotides of glgB (glgBΔ270) resulted in comparatively high glycogen accumulation. with the glycogen having short ACL. Complete knockout of glgB led to the formation of amylose-like glycogen containing long. linear α1.4-glucan chains with significantly reduced branching frequency. Physiologically. the set of mutant strains had reduced bacterial starvation resistance. while minimally increasing bacterial desiccation resistance. Finally. although there were no obvious changes in cold stress resistance or biofilm forming ability. one strain (glgBΔ180) had significantly …,True,9IsCjnIAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC,12,https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-015-0421-9,8931041228565264733,/scholar?cites=8931041228565264733,,https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-015-0421-9,0,0,0

University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",,219,,Rice is a very important cereal crop. It serves as a major source of dietary energy for more than half of the world’s population. Rice grain is usually polished to make it more acceptable to consumers. Consequently. commercially available rice grains have high glycaemic index (GI) and trace amounts of resistant starch (RS). These traits are undesirable considering the alarming global increase in the incidence of ailments like diabetes. cardiovascular disease. colorectal cancer and obesity. The development of rice grains with reduced digestibility can be an effective strategy to manage these nutrition-associated conditions. This can be done by developing rice grains with high amylose because it is associated with elevated RS and reduced GI.

Rice endosperm SSIIa is more active in indica accessions compared to japonica lines due to functional SNP variations in the coding region of the structural gene. In this study. downregulating the expression of japonica-type SSIIa in Nipponbare endosperm resulted in either shrunken or opaque grains with elevated proportion of A-type starch granules. Shrunken seeds had severely reduced starch content and could not be maintained in succeeding generations. In comparison. the opaque grain morphology was the result of weaker down-regulation of SSIIa which led to an elevated proportion of short-chain amylopectin (DP 6-12) and a concomitant reduction in the proportion of medium chain amylopectin (DP 13-36). The peak gelatinisation temperature of starch and the estimated glycaemic score of cooked grain as measured by starch hydrolysis index were significantly reduced.

The analysis of this region provides a multi-species-specific diagnosis by a single PCR. Using ITS1 primer-based PCR. a cross sectional study was carried out in the period from September to November 2009 on samples collected from 687 camels from geographically distinct zones in the Sudan to detect all possible African trypanosomes. which can infect camels. The results showed that all PCR-positive camels were infected with a single parasite species; Trypanosoma evansi. The highest prevalence. 57.1% (117/205). was observed in the Butana plains of mid-Eastern Sudan and the lowest. 6.0% (4/67). was in the Umshadeeda eastern part of White Nile State. In another experiment. the RoTat 1.2 gene encoding the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) of T. evansi was analyzed for its presence or absence by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using T. evansi species-specific primers. The study showed that the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene was absent in thirteen out of thirty T. evansi-positive samples. It is concluded that camel trypanosomiasis in Sudan is apparently caused by a single parasite species T. evansi and there were no other typanosomes species detected. In addition. the disease is highly prevalent in the country. which strengthens the need to change control policies and institute measures that help prevent the spread of the parasite.

However. its efficacy has not been scientifically validated. The aim of this study therefore is to investigate the antinociceptive. antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activities of its aqueous extracts. The plant extract was collected from Loita division. Narok county in Kenya. A total of 96 albino mice with an average weight of 20 g was used for this study. Antinociceptive activity was determined by use of formalin− induced writhing test. A writhe was recorded by a stopwatch following the stretching of the abdomen and/or stretching of at least one hind limb. Anti-inflammatory activity was established by a formalin induced inflammation test. Hourly changes in paw sizes and reduction of edema around the paw was determined using a venier calipers. Antipyretic activity was carried out using Brewer’s yeast induced pyrexia. Temperature of each mouse was determined rectally by thermal probe thermometer. The aqueous leaf extracts of A. nilotica reduced pain. inflammation and fever mostly at dose 150 mg/kg body weight. Based on these findings it was concluded that the present study has demonstrated the antinociceptive. anti-inflammatory and antipyretic potential of aqueous leaf extracts of A. nilotica in albino mice and will serve as good bio-resource for generating readily available herbal formulations that are more effective in the treatment of pain. inflammation and fever conditions which are cheaper than the conventional synthetic drugs and have no side effects.,True,jV7c78UAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC,22,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathew_Ngugi2/publication/299346569_Antipyretic_Antiinflammatory_and_Antinociceptive_Activities_of_Aqueous_Bark_Extract_of_Acacia_Nilotica_L_Delile_in_Albino_Mice/links/56f16c2a08aed354e56fb7dd.pdf,9198843476416112563,/scholar?cites=9198843476416112563,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathew_Ngugi2/publication/299346569_Antipyretic_Antiinflammatory_and_Antinociceptive_Activities_of_Aqueous_Bark_Extract_of_Acacia_Nilotica_L_Delile_in_Albino_Mice/links/56f16c2a08aed354e56fb7dd.pdf,0,0,0

Limited,Purpose–The paper is an excerpt from a bigger study with an overall aim of examining the extent to which climate change adaptation has been integrated in the EIA studies undertaken in Kenya since the process inception in 2000. The purpose was to establish whether adequate attention is given to the issue of climate change mitigation as major challenge in the world during the 21st century.Design/methodology/approach–The research design is based on qualitative research involving a review of EIA reports approved by the national environmental authority and also based on key informant consultations with licensed EIA experts in the country. Thereafter. the findings were analyzed through standard statistical procedures. Findings–The findings showed that climate change integration in all the reviewed EIA reports was mainly restricted to mere consideration of historical climate change information in the project areas and totally weak in terms of climate change prediction scenarios and their likely impacts on the proposed development projects. However. consultations with most EIA practitioners indicated that integration of climate change adaptive capabilities into the EIA process was a relevant issue but admitted that the implementation modalities were unclear.Originality/value–The study is the first in evaluating the level of integration for climate change in EIA studies in Kenya and the findings will inform EIA implementation in the country.

Synthetic anti-inflammatory drugs are not readily available and have adverse side effects. Alternative herbal medicines possess bioactive compounds that are safer and efficient in the management of various diseases and disorders. The present study evaluated for the anti-inflammatory activity of methanolic extracts of Kigelia africana and Acacia hockii in mice to scientifically validate their traditional use among the Embu and Mbeere communities in Kenya. The plant samples were collected with the help of local herbalists in Embu County. Kenya and transported to Kenyatta University biochemistry and biotechnology laboratories for cleaning. air drying. milling. and extraction. Swiss albino mice of either sex were randomly divided into six groups of 5 animals each; normal control. negative control. positive control and three experimental groups. The anti-inflammatory activity was tested using carrageenan-induced hind paw edema method. The anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts was compared to reference drug diclofenac.

The root of the plant is usually used in the treatment of a wide range of pains.Objective: The study was carried out to evaluate the hepatoprotective potential of the methanol leaf extract of Ziziphus mucronata (ZMLM).Method: The extract was prepared by soaking in 70% methanol/water and rotary evaporation. The phenol content of extract was then estimated. Twenty five adult male Sprague dawley rats (aged 21 weeks) were divided into five groups of five rats each and treated as follows; normal control (NC) received distilled water. Dimethoate control (DC)(received 6 mg/kg. bw. day-1 dimethoate dissolved in distilled water). Experimental Groups (E1) received dimethoate (6mg/kg. bw)+ ZMLM (100 mg/kg. bw-1);(E2) received dimethoate (6 mg/kg. bw)+ ZMLM (200 mg/kg. bw-1) and (E3) received dimethoate (6 mg/kg. bw)+ ZMLM (300 mg/kg. bw-1). In both the cases a normal control and dimethoate control were kept to compare the results. After 90 days. blood was collected and rats were sacrificed to collect the liver tissue for biochemical assays and histological estimations.Results: The results of E1 did not show much change from the normal control group but was significantly different from the dimethoate control group (P≤ 0.05). The preventive effect which was tested in E2 and E3 proved that the extract could almost retain the normal condition in 90 days time.

Freshly flayed bovine hide was commercially procured and conventionally prepared prior to tanning. The hide was then cut into two identical halves; one half was left at pickled stage and the other was chrome-tanned at Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute. Specimens were cut in both parallel and perpendicular sampling directions using press knife in template. Eight rectangular samples. each of dimensions 50 mm and 25 mm in template. were cut from each sampling direction in dumb-bell shape. The specimens were then conditioned in standard atmosphere of temperature 23±2 C and humidity of 50±5% RH for 48 hours prior to testing. Tensile strength. tear strength and percentage elongation were tested using Instron Testing Machine (Model 1101) at a jaws separation speed of 100 mm/min and gauge length of 100 mm.

These species play a key role in oxidative stress. leading to the development and progression of many disorders. including hypertension. cancer. diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. This study estimated the levels of serum antioxidant vitamins and Malondialdehyde (MDA) as evidence of lipid peroxidation. Healthy male smokers aged 15-35years from Usmanu Danfodiyo University Sokoto community who consume at least five sticks of cigarette/day were recruited for the study. Serum Antioxidant vitamins (A. C. and E) and MDA were estimated using standard methods and compared to aged matched control (non-smokers) group. The levels of antioxidant vitamins were found to be significantly lower in smokers than non-smoker P< 0.05. On the other hand. MDA concentration was found to be significantly higher in smokers than nonsmokers P< 0.05. Interestingly. the number of cigarettes consumed/day determines antioxidants depletion. as well as MDA build up.

Pretreatment and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass are crucial steps in bioethanol production. Our study determined the efficiency of three pretreatment techniques namely water. alkaline. and acidic pretreatments on the production of bioethanol. We applied the same hydrolysis technique using H2SO4 to all the pretreatment techniques. Our results showed highest reducing sugar concentrations when banana peels were pretreated with acid; pretreatment using water alone gave the lowest reducing sugar concentrations. We used an activated strain of S. cerevisiae to convert the reducing sugars to bioethanol via a three-day fermentation process. The bioethanol concentrations detected by GC-FID from the water. acidic. and alkaline pretreatments were 40 ppm. 60 ppm. and 80 ppm respectively.

1056986,The effect of temperature. turbulence. and Ph on the solubility of MTBE,2016,Gaddafi I Danmaliki and Abdullahi A Shamsuddeen and Bashir J Usman,3,European Journal of Earth and Environment Vol,2,,,Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) is a fuel oxygenate whose discharge is inevitable in the environment. consequently posing serious health and environmental effects. The solubility of this volatile organic compound (VOC) has not been studied extensively. the few studies available present contrasting views. This study used a spectrophotometer to determine the effects of pH (5. 7 & 9). mixing rate (400 rpm & 600 rpm). and time (1 hour) on the solubility of MTBE in water. We calculated the max and the molar absorptivity of MTBE as 190 nm and 167 M-cm-respectively. MTBE spiked at pH 9 gave the highest absorbance. while the results obtained at pH 5 gave the lowest absorbance. However. MTBE spiked at pH 7 was more soluble and relatively stable. A low mixing rate of 400 rpm enhanced the solubility of MTBE indicating that turbulence reduces the solubility of MTBE in water. Moreover. our results indicate that low temperature enhances the solubility of MTBE. The solubility of MTBE at 25 C using a mixing rate of 400 rpm and 600 rpm was 0.08 g/L and 0.044 g/L respectively.

Lead is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and placenta. and accumulates in soft and hard tissues. Lead can be excreted in urine. stool. milk. sweat. nails and saliva. During pregnancy and lactation. lead is released from bones into the blood along with Ca 2+. The toxic effects of lead on various human tissues have been studied extensively. but few studies have addressed its impact on fetal development during pregnancy. Blood levels of lead are higher in people living in lead-polluted regions. It has been reported that Tehran (central and southern parts) is the most problematic city in terms of lead poisoning.Methods: From 86 sets of mothers and newborns in a non-polluted area of rural Rasht. Iran. we examined specimens of maternal blood. cord blood and colostrum (86× 3= 258) and specimens from 85 sets of mothers and newborns in a polluted area of Tehran.

The 223A/G polymorphism of the LEPR gene is one of the most common polymorphism in all populations. In this study. we aimed to investigate the impact of the 223A/G polymorphism of the LEPR gene on serum levels of leptin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a sample of Iranian population.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and forty-four T2DM patients were screened and compared to 147 healthy controls. The 223A/G LEPR polymorphism was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The serum levels of leptin were measured.RESULTS: The mean serum levels of leptin in T2DM patients were significantly higher than that of healthy control subjects; 22.90 ng/ml (95% confidence interval [CI]= 20.79–25.23) vs. 8.70 ng/ml (95% CI= 7.87–9.63).

This structure–function trade-off can constrain possible adaptive evolutionary changes of function and may hamper protein engineering efforts to design proteins with new functions.

1057148,The Role of RNA-binding Proteins in Mitochondrial Gene Expression,2014,Tara Richman,,,,,,Mitochondria are ubiquitous organelles of eukaryotic cells that contain a circular double-stranded genome encoding 13 polypeptide subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The genes for these polypeptides are transcribed and translated in the mitochondrial matrix. using 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNAs encoded by the compact mitochondrial DNA. Mammalian mitochondrial mRNAs generally begin at the start codon and lack conventional 5′ untranslated regions or Shine-Dalgarno sequences. In addition. mitochondrial encoded proteins are hydrophobic and are likely to be cotranslationally inserted into the membrane-embedded complexes providing unique constraints for their translation.

1057184,Biochemical and structural analyses of TBL1: insights into the function of a transcriptional regulator,2010,Yoana Nantcheva Dimitrova,,,,,,The mechanism controlling the switch between gene activation and repression is critically important for understanding the process of transcriptional regulation. Gene expression is highly controlled through a dynamic exchange between co-activators and co-repressors from DNA bound transcription factors. TBL1 is an essential multi-domain scaffolding protein that appears to mediate the switch between transcriptional activation and repression of β-catenin and nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs). The mechanism of TBL1 as a transcriptional regulator has been the main focus of this dissertation. The role of TBL1 was first investigated in the context of the SCF(TBL1) complex in the poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of β-catenin under UV-induced genotoxic stress. Over-expression and purification protocols were developed for each of the SCF(TBL1) proteins. enabling a systematic analysis of β-catenin ubiquitination using an in vitro ubiquitination assay. This study revealed that Siah-1 alone was able to poly-ubiquitinate β-catenin. Moreover. TBL1 was found to protect β-catenin from Siah-1 ubiquitination in vitro and from Siah-1-targeted proteasomal degradation in cells. Both Siah-1 and TBL1 bind to the armadillo repeat domain of β-catenin. suggesting poly-ubiquitination of β-catenin is regulated by competition between Siah-1 and TBL1.  To gain insight into the function of TBL1 within multi-protein complexes that regulate the transcriptional activity of β-catenin and NHRs. this work pursued the structural and biochemical characterization of TBL1.

In this sense. processes of advanced oxidation (PAOs) have yielded promising results. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is customarily used as faecal bacterial indicator to determine the efficiency of disinfection processes. However. it has been shown that E. coli is less resistant to disinfection than other enteric bacteria such as Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. Additionally. the viable non-culturable (VNC) state yields bacteria which are not detectable on many culture media.Objective: The main objective is to standardize a method for counting Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. in specific liquid media to reliably quantify the bacteriological potential risk related to disinfection processes based on PAO.Methods: The study followed a randomized bi-factorial experimental design and the Duncan multiple comparison test. This design allowed the selection of specific liquid media to fittingly standardize the counting of Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.Results: We found that the best broth for counting Salmonella typhimurium strain at different concentrations in pure and mixed cultures was the Rappaport broth RP. the EE broth also allowed growing the two bacterial species tested in this research. Nonetheless. the latter results suggest the use of additional tests for this particular broth.Discussion: There was a variation in the counting results when pure cultures were used compared …,True,ijvmB8wAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,7,http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1657-95342010000100008,427646110053051012,/scholar?cites=427646110053051012,,http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1657-95342010000100008,0,0,0

Therefore. the aim of this study was to evaluate the persistence phenotype in A. baumannii strains. as well as its variation among strains after treatment with polymyxin B and tobramycin. Stationary cultures of 37 polymyxin B-susceptible clinical strains of A. baumannii were analyzed for surviving cells after exposure to 15 µg/mL of polymyxin B for 6 h. by serial dilutions and colony counting. Among these. the 30 tobramycin-susceptible isolates also underwent tobramycin treatment at a concentration of 160 µg/mL and persister cells occurrence was evaluated equally. A high heterogeneity of persister cells formation patterns among isolates was observed. Polymyxin B-treated cultures presented persister cells corresponding from 0.0007% to 10.1% of the initial population and two isolates failed to produce detectable persister cells under this condition. A high variability could also be observed when cells were treated with tobramycin: the persister fraction corresponded to 0.0003%–11.84% of the pre-treatment population. Moreover. no correlation was found between persister subpopulations comparing both antibiotics among isolates. indicating that different mechanisms underlie the internal control of this phenotype.

1057317,Combination of polymyxin B and meropenem eradicates persister cells from Acinetobacter baumannii strains in exponential growth,2017,Stephanie W Gallo and Carlos Alexandre S Ferreira and Sílvia D de Oliveira,66,J Med Microbiol,8,1257-1260,,Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic pathogen that causes several healthcare-associated infections that have high rates of morbidity and mortality in hospital settings. particularly in intensive care units [1]. Treatment of infections caused by A. baumannii has become increasingly limited due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant isolates. including resistance to carbapenems. leaving polymyxins as the last therapeutic resource. Although the standard antimicrobial scheme against A. baumannii infections has not been fully established. evidence supports the fact that combination therapies including polymyxin B are more effective than polymyxin B monotherapies. Moreover. polymyxin B combined with a second antimicrobial agent was able to reduce hospital mortality rates. and has been widely recommended due to resistance emerging in some A. baumannii strains during treatments [2-4]. Nevertheless. antimicrobial therapy failure has been reported. especially in recalcitrance of chronic infections. which may be due to the tolerance mediated by persister cells [5. 6]-a microbial subpopulation able to survive to normally lethal concentrations of bactericidal antimicrobials [7]. as has been previously described in Acinetobacter spp. exposed to polymyxin B [8]. This tolerance appears to be a transient phenotype that may be understood as arising from a combination of epigenetic inheritance and cellular noise [9]. whose regulation involves a multiplicity of pathways [10].

In this study. we aimed to evaluate the presence of A. baumannii in an ICU environment and gloves from ICU workers and to characterize the antimicrobial resistance of the isolates in comparison with those isolated from ICU patients at the same hospital.  METHODS:  ICU samples were collected from March to November 2010. Isolates biochemically characterized as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex were evaluated by PCR targeting the 16S rDNA and bla OXA-51 genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using the disk diffusion method. and carbapenem-resistant isolates were also evaluated for the minimum inhibitory concentration of imipenem using broth microdilution. The presence of the bla OXA-23 gene was evaluated in isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems.  RESULTS: A. baumannii was detected in 9.5% (84) of the 886 samples collected from the ICU environment. including from furniture. medical devices. and gloves. with bed rails being the most contaminated location (23.8%; 20/84). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii was found in 98.8% (83/84) of non-clinical and 97.8% (45/46) of clinical isolates. Reduced susceptibility to carbapenems was detected in 83.3% (70/84) of non-clinical and 80.4% (37/46) of clinical isolates. All isolates resistant to carbapenems harbored bla OXA-23.

Cambridge, United Kingdom. Vol. 136, no. 11 (Sept. 2009), p. 1339-1349",,,,Ticks are blood-feeding arthropods widely distributed in the world and vectors of several diseases. As haematophagy demands evasion strategies and repeatedly infested hosts develop protective immune responses. we investigated the mechanisms of the Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus saliva anti-haemostatic activity and the possible relationship between the acquired natural anti-tick host resistance and anti-haemostatic action. For this purpose. we studied the effects of R. microplus saliva on different pathways of haemostasis and tested whether repeated infested bovine sera (RIBS) are able to abolish salivary anti-haemostatic activities. R. microplus saliva (i) displays inhibitory activity upon collagen-induced platelet aggregation; (ii) inhibits the induction of endothelial pro-coagulant state ; and (iii) reduces thrombogenesis in vivo. RIBS were shown to be able to partially block the delay of coagulation and the anti-thrombotic effect of saliva. and to totally abolish the modulation of endothelium activation. Conversely. RIBS has no effect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation. These results show. for the first time. the neutralization ability of sera from acquired resistance hosts against tick antihaemostatics. Moreover. this is the first report of a haematophagous parasite able to modulate endothelial cell procoagulant state. and addresses the presence of anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic activity in R. microplus saliva.,True,a-U69U0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,17,https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/27465,307404182132315757,/scholar?cites=307404182132315757,,https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/bitstream/handle/10183/27465/000750325.pdf,0,0,0

The device consists of a laser diode and sensor mounted to a motorized. bi-directional. X-Y table. The laser measures the distance to the wound surface as the X-Y table moves over the wound. The laser beam diameter is and can measure distances as small as. The distance information from the laser is used to produce the 3D image and to calculate the volume of the wound. The accuracy of this device is demonstrated by measuring rubber model wounds of 0.5. 1 and 2 ml. The per cent error for the 0.5 and 1 ml model wounds was less than 1 per cent and approximately 4 per cent for the 2 ml model.

Since sdLDL-C changes may be related to PCSK9 and SREBP-2 functions. the aim of this study was to investigate correlations between sdLDL-C. circulating PCSK9. SREBP-2 expression and some lipid parameters in serum and buffy coat fraction of healthy subjects.Methods: One hundred and twenty-four subjects were randomly included in the study. The lipid profile was measured using routine laboratory methods. The serum sdLDL-C level was calculated by a heparin-related precipitation technique. The cellular LDL-C/protein and cholesterol/protein values were measured after lysing of cells with methanol/chloroform binary solvent. The circulating PCSK9 level was measured using ELISA technique. The SREBP-2 expression level was estimated using the RT-qPCR technique.Results: Data showed significant correlations between LDL-C. TG and sdLDL-C levels (r=0.34. p=0.001; r=0.2. p=0.04).

DETA/NO with a half-life of 57h at 25 C showed antifungal activity against all tested dermatophyte species (MIC 0.150 to 2.5 mg/ml). DPTA/NO with a half life of 3h at 37 C showed antifungal activity against five species of Candida and Cryptococcus neoformans. and DEA/NO with a half life of 2 min at 37 C and 16 min at 25 C did not show antifungal activity against tested strains.

In bacteria. two isozymes. O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-A and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-B. have been identified that share similar binding sites. although the respective specific functions are still debated. O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase plays a key role in the adaptation of bacteria to the host environment. in the defense mechanisms to oxidative stress and in antibiotic resistance. Because mammals synthesize cysteine from methionine and lack O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. the enzyme is a potential target for antimicrobials. With this aim. we first identified potential inhibitors of the two isozymes via a ligand- and structure-based in silico screening of a subset of the ZINC library using FLAP. The binding affinities of the most promising candidates were measured in vitro on purified O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-A and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-B from Salmonella typhimurium by a direct method that exploits the change in the cofactor fluorescence. Two molecules were identified with dissociation constants of 3.7 and 33 µM for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-A and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-B. respectively.

So far. proteomic tools have never been applied to characterize the proteome of saffron or identify possible cases of fraud. In this study. 1D-Gel Electrophoresis was carried out to characterize the protein profile of (i) fresh stigmas and styles of the plant;(ii) dried stigmas and styles from different geographical origins (Spanish. Italian. Greek and Iranian) that had been stored for various periods of time after their processing; and (iii) two common plant adulterants. dried petals of Carthamus tinctorius L. and dried fruits of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis. A selective protein extraction protocol was applied to avoid interference from colored saffron metabolites. such as crocins. during electrophoretic analyses of saffron. We succeeded in separating and assigning the molecular weights to more than 20 proteins.

MinD recruits MinE to the membrane. leading to a coupled oscillation required for spatial regulation of the cytokinetic Z ring. How these proteins interact. however. is not clear because the MinD-binding regions of MinE are sequestered within a six-stranded β sheet and masked by N-terminal helices. minE mutations that restore interaction between some MinD and MinE mutants were isolated. These mutations alter the MinE structure leading to release of the MinD-binding regions and the N-terminal helices that bind the membrane.

How 2i maintains a ground state of ESCs remains elusive. Here we show that MEKi and GSK3i maintain the ESC ground state by downregulating global DNA methylation through two distinct mechanisms. MEK1 phosphorylates JMJD2C for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Therefore. MEKi increased JMJD2C protein levels but decreased DNMT3 expression.

HIF-luciferase assay. cytotoxic assay. platelet aggregation assay. western blot analysis. quantitative real-time PCR. aqueous solubility. protein binding. metabolic stability. and metabolic pathways. Results: Thirteen novel benzimidazole analogs were synthesized. Compounds 3a and 3k showed the highest anti-HIF-1α activity. They are significantly more effective than YC-1 in the suppression of HIF-1α protein expression based on western blot assay. They show comparable potency in inhibition of cancer cell migration. They are less potent in the inhibition of platelet aggregation. 3k had the most favorable drug-like properties. including long half-life in human liver microsomes. medium protein binding level and reasonable aqueous solubility. Conclusion: The potent anti-HIF-1α activity and favorable …,True,e7a3wCMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,6,https://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/34/8/3891.short,15059434669748094563,/scholar?cites=15059434669748094563,,https://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/34/8/3891.full.pdf,0,0,0
1057469,Essential Role for FtsL in Activation of Septal Peptidoglycan Synthesis,2020,Kyung-Tae Park and Shishen Du and Joe Lutkenhaus,11,Mbio,6,,American Society for Microbiology,Spatiotemporal regulation of septal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis is achieved by coupling assembly and activation of the synthetic enzymes (FtsWI) to the Z ring. a cytoskeletal element that is required for division in most bacteria. In Escherichia coli. the recruitment of the FtsWI complex is dependent upon the cytoplasmic domain of FtsL. a component of the conserved FtsQLB complex. Once assembled. FtsWI is activated by the arrival of FtsN. which acts through FtsQLB and FtsA. which are also essential for their recruitment. However. the mechanism of activation of FtsWI by FtsN is not clear. Here. we identify a region of FtsL that plays a key role in the activation of FtsWI which we designate AWI (activation of FtsWI) and present evidence that FtsL acts through FtsI. Our results suggest that FtsN switches FtsQLB from a recruitment complex to an activator with FtsL interacting with FtsI to activate FtsW. Since FtsQLB and …,True,e7a3wCMAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,1,https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/6/e03012-20.abstract,965329224950416088,/scholar?cites=965329224950416088,,https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/6/e03012-20,0,0,0
