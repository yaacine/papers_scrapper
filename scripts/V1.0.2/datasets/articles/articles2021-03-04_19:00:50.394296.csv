The reinventions were catalyzed by the limits of power dissipation and self-heating for the corresponding device technologies. In the 1950s. when the vacuum tubes reached the power dissipation limits. the more power efficient bipolar transistors took over.

1134342,Mineral bridges in nacre,2011,Antonio G Checa and Julyan HE Cartwright and Marc-Georg Willinger,176,Journal of structural biology,3,330-339,Academic Press,We confirm with high-resolution techniques the existence of mineral bridges between superposed nacre tablets. In the towered nacre of both gastropods and the cephalopod Nautilus there are large bridges aligned along the tower axes. corresponding to gaps (150–200 nm) in the interlamellar membranes. Gaps are produced by the interaction of the nascent tablets with a surface membrane that covers the nacre compartment. In the terraced nacre of bivalves bridges associated with elongated gaps in the interlamellar membrane (>100 nm) have mainly been found at or close to the edges of superposed parental tablets. To explain this placement. we hypothesize that the interlamellar membrane breaks due to differences in osmotic pressure across it when the interlamellar space below becomes reduced at an advanced stage of calcification.

It is covered by a surface membrane. which protects the growing nacre surface from damage when the animal withdraws into its shell. The surface membrane is supplied by vesicles that adhere to it on its mantle side and secretes interlamellar membranes from the nacre side. Nacre tablets rapidly grow in height and later expand sideways; the part of the tablet formed during this initial growth phase is here called the core. During initial growth. the tips of the cores remain permanently submerged within the surface membrane. The interlamellar membranes. which otherwise separate the nacre tablet lamellae. do not extend across cores. which are aligned in stacked tablets forming the tower axis. and thus towers of nacre tablets are continuous along the central axis.

The objective of this work is to assess the climate change over South America based on the Eta simulations. The future changes are shown in timeslices of 30 years: 2011-2040; 2041-2070 and 2071-2100. The climate change response of the Eta simulations nested in HadGEM2-ES is larger than the Eta nested in MIROC5. Major warming area is located in the central part of Brazil. In austral summer. the reduction of precipitation in the central part and the increase in the southeastern part of the continent are common changes in these simulations. while the EtaHadGEM2-ES intensifies the decrease of precipitation in central Brazil. the Eta-MIROC5 expands the area of increase of precipitation in southern Brazil toward the end of the century. In austral winter. precipitation decrease is found in the northern part of South America and in most of Central America. whereas the reduction in southeastern South America is limited to near coastal region. The time series of temperatures show that warming trends are larger in the Eta-HadGEM2-ES than in the Eta-MIROC5 simulations. Heavier precipitation rates are projected in the Central-South of Brazil toward the end of the century.

The proposed mechanisms which may mediate the putative relationship between psychosocial conditions and inflammatory periodontal diseases remain to be tested.

Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are nested in global climate models (GCMs). The objective of this work is to evaluate the Eta RCM simulations driven by three global models. the HadGEM2-ES. BESM. and MIROC5. for the present period. 1961-1990. The RCM domain covers South America. Central America. and Caribbean. These simulations will be used for assessment of climate change projections in the region. Maximum temperatures are generally underestimated in the domain. in particular by MIROC5 driven simulations. in summer and winter seasons. Larger spread among the simulations was found in the minimum temperatures. which showed mixed signs of errors. The spatial correlations of temperature simulations against the CRU observations show better agreement for the MIROC5 driven simulations. The nested simulations underestimate precipitation in large areas over the continent in austral summer. whereas in winter overestimate occurs in southern Amazonia. and underestimate in southern Brazil and eastern coast of Northeast Brazil. The annual cycle of the near-surface temperature is underestimated in all model simulations. in all regions in Brazil. and in most of the year. The temperature and precipitation frequency distributions reveal that the RCM and GCM simulations contain more extreme values than the CRU observations.

The open cholecystectomy technique was first performed late in the nineteenth century [2] and developed in the twentieth century as described by O’Conor in 1922 [3]. Later. advances in surgical technique led to an urge to minimize the surgical approach to less invasive surgery. In 1982 Dubois and Berthelot proposed the minicholecystectomy as an open approach to cholecystectomy by an abdominal incision smaller than 6cm [4]; they were later followed by others [5. 6]. Since the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy was reported by Mühe in 1985 [7] and Mouret et al. in 1987 [8. 9]. laparoscopy has become the procedure of choice for treating symptomatic biliary lithiasis [10]. In recent years. extensive research has been conducted to overcome laparoscopy by using a flexible scope via a transluminal access to the abdominal cavity to perform surgery without scars [11].In order to ensure a safe approach to the abdominal cavity. several accesses to performing natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) have been tested in animal models [12]. Transgastric NOTES appendectomies [13] and transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomies have been reported in animals [14] and in humans [15–18].

The aim of the study was to transfer some of the graphene's attractive properties to the MOF materials. An important observation was that the incorporation of rGO did not alter or interfere with the crystallization of the MOF material. The studies showed an increase in surface area for the rGO/Zr-MOF composite (1480 m2/g) when compared to that of pristine Zr-MOF (1116 m2/g). There was also an enhancement of the hydrogen storage capacity from 1.4 wt% to 1.8 wt% for the GO/Zr-MOF composite.

Management of this fly ash has been a concern and various approaches for its beneficial use have been investigated. Over the last two decades. there has been intensive research internationally that has focused on the use of different sources of fly ash for zeolite synthesis.However. most of the studies have concentrated on class C fly ash and very few have reported the use of South African class F fly ash as feedstock for zeolite synthesis.Class F fly ash from South Africa has been confirmed to be a good substrate for zeolite synthesis due to its compositional dominance of aluminosilicate and silicate phases. However. because differences in quartz-mullite/glass proportions of fly ash from different sources produces impure phases or different zeolite mineral phases under the same activation conditions. the present study focused on optimization of synthesis conditions to obtain pure phase zeolite Na-P1 from class F South African coal fly ash. Synthesis variables evaluated in this study were; hydrothermal treatment time (12 - 48 hours). temperature (100 – 160 oC) and addition of varying molar quantities of water during the hydrothermal treatment step (H2O:SiO2 molar ratio ranged between 0 - 0.49).Once the most suitable conditions for the synthesis of pure phase zeolite Na-P1 from fly ash were identified. a statistical approach was adopted to refine the experiments. that was designed to evaluate the interactive effects of some of the most important synthesis variables.

There are two approaches to increase the number of surface atoms in solids. namely. to decrease the size of dense particles or to create an open pore network within the bulk of the solid. Both approaches result in an increase in the specific surface area of materials.

A characteristic feature of the obtained composites is the relatively large single‐crystal core and the very thin polycrystalline shell. The incompatibility between the core crystals and the zeolite precursor mixture yielding the shell layer has been circumvented by the adsorption of nanoseeds on the core surface. which induced the crystallization of the shell. The pretreated core crystals are subsequently subjected to a continuous growth in a zeolite precursor mixture. The feasibility of this synthetic approach has been exemplified by the preparation of core–shell β‐zeolite–silicalite‐1 composites.

Two synthesis routes have been studied thus far namely the 2-step method and the fusion assisted process. Fly ash contains several elements originating from coal which is incorporated in the ash during combustion. It is vital to determine the final destination of these elements in order to unveil optimization opportunities for scale-up purposes. The aim of this study was to perform a material balance study on both synthesis routes to determine the distributional fate of these elements during the synthesis of zeolites. Zeolites were first synthesized by means of the two synthesis routes. The composition of all raw materials and products were determined after which an overall and elemental balance were performed. Results indicated that in the 2-step method almost all elements were concentrated in the solid zeolite product while during the fusion assisted route the elements mostly report to the solid waste. Toxic elements such as Pb. Hg. Al. As and Nb were found in both the supernatant waste and washing water resulting from each synthesis route. It has also been seen that large quantities of Si and Al are wasted in the supernatant waste. It is highly recommended that the opportunity to recycle this liquid waste be investigated for scale-up purposes. Results also indicate that efficiency whereby Si and Al are extracted from fused ash is exceptionally poor and should be optimized.

ISSN: 9781431203062",,,,Safe water is essential to human health and the development of a country. In developing countries. eruptions of water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever are still out of control. In South Africa. between November 2008 to January 2009. 5341 patients were diagnosed and treated for cholera and 34 people died as a result of the disease. Rural communities are the most affected by these waterborne disease eruptions because of the lack of affordable and easy techniques to disinfect water from open water sources prior to human consumption. Clay filter pots have been employed to ameliorate the water quality in rural areas; several attempts have been made in order to improve the quality of these ceramic pots. Colloidal silver (used as a powerful disinfectant) is brush coated onto the Potters for Peace (PFP) pot. which leaches out over a period of time. Von Naegeli and others in 1893 discovered that the antibacterial activities of silver were due to the Ag+. A small amount of Ag+ is released from the metallic surface when placed in contact with liquids. The result of the ongoing research will help to ameliorate the PFP pot model with the innovative use of the zeolites as an adsorbing platform for silver nanoparticles as a source of Ag+ as disinfectant.In this study. natural zeolite clinoptilolite Hard and Soft samples (HEC and SEC respectively) from the Ecca Holdings mine were pre-treated using 1 M HCl for four cycles under stirring condition. for 2 hours each cycle.

The electrospun PAN-nfs surfaces are relatively in-active and hydrophobic. and. therefore. hinder some potential applications; however. chemical surface modification reactions. such as amination. reduction. hydrolysis. and amidoximation. have been carried out on them. These reactions bring about functional groups. such as amine. hydroxyl. carboxylic. imine etc. to the surface PAN-nfs and invariably make their surfaces active and hydrophilic.

It is therefore important to study the interaction chemistry of the fly ash-brine systems to fully understand the leaching and mobility of the contaminant species. and to determine the possibility of capturing the salts from the brine solution when fly ash and brine are co-disposed. In order to achieve the aims and objectives of this study. several leaching procedures such as batch reaction tests. long-term fly ash-brine interaction tests. acid neutralization capacity (ANC) tests. up-flow percolation tests and sequential extraction tests were employed.

It can react nonspecifically in breaking down persistent organic pollutants in water into their mineral form. It can also recombine to form hydrogen peroxide which is very useful in water treatment. In this study. terephthalic acid (TA) and potassium iodide dosimetry were used to quantify and investigate the behaviour of the generated OH radical in a laboratory scale sonicator. The 2-hydroxyl terephthalic acid (HTA) formed during terephthalic acid dosimetry was determined by optical fibre spectrometer. The production rate of HTA served as a means of evaluating and characterizing the OH• generated over given time in a sonicator. The influence of sonicator power intensity. solution pH and irradiation time upon OH• generation were investigated. Approximately 2.2 ´ 10-9 M s-1 of OH radical was generated during the sonication process.

An alternative definition is proposed that allows the estimation of the intrinsic (internal) solar to chemical conversion efficiency of the photoelectrode rather than the overall efficiency of the entire tandem cell. We show how the photocurrent and photovoltage produced by the photoelectrode can be extracted from three-electrode voltammograms measured in the dark and under illumination.

In conventional water electrolysis. the water oxidation and reduction reactions are coupled in both time and space. as they occur simultaneously at an anode and a cathode in the same cell. This introduces challenges. such as product separation. and sets strict constraints on material selection and process conditions. Here. we decouple these reactions by dividing the process into two steps: an electrochemical step that reduces water at the cathode and oxidizes the anode. followed by a spontaneous chemical step that is driven faster at higher temperature. which reduces the anode back to its initial state by oxidizing water.

A hydrophobic microsphere (radius. r ∼ 20–30 μm) is brought into contact with a small sessile water drop resting on a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface. When the microsphere touches the liquid surface. the meniscus rises onto it because of capillary forces. Although the microsphere volume is 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the drop. it excites the normal resonance modes of the liquid interface. The sphere is pinned at the interface. whose small (<100 nm) oscillations are readily measured with AFM. Resonance oscillation frequencies were measured for drop volumes between 5 and 200 μL.

High deposition rates (> 5 Å/s) lead to the growth of mixed phase films which are of the cubic phase near the film/substrate interface before forming monoclinic phase as distance from the interface increases. By decreasing the deposition rate to < 1 Å/s for films grown at temperatures of 650 °C. films up to one micron thick have been grown in the pure cubic phase. The growth of the thermodynamically stable cubic phase under these conditions is attributed to both higher surface mobility of the adatoms during growth and to increased tensile stress within the film.

The film flip and transfer process improves the performance of photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting comprising ultrathin (<20 nm) hematite (α‐Fe2O3) films on silver–gold alloy (90 at% Ag–10 at% Au) back‐reflectors.

However. metallic back reflectors are not suitable for tandem cell configurations because photons cannot be transmitted through the device.

We showcase this by designing and fabricating a photoelectrochemical–photovoltaic (PEC–PV) stacked tandem cell in a V-shaped configuration where short wavelength photons are reflected back to the photoanode material (hematite. α-Fe2O3). whereas long wavelength photons are transmitted to the bottom silicon PV cell.

To be useful. such functionality needs to be developed in thin film devices. The key functionality of long-distance spin-transport has. however. so far only been reported in bulk single crystal antiferromagnets. while in thin films. transport has so far been limited to a few nanometers. In this work. we electrically achieve a long-distance propagation of spin-information in thin films of the insulating antiferromagnet hematite. Through transport and magnetic imaging. we demonstrate a strong correlation between the efficiency of the transport of magnons. which carry spin-information. and the magnetic domain structure of the films. In thin films with large domains. magnons propagate over micrometer distances whilst they attenuate over much shorter distances in multidomain thin films. The governing factor of the attenuation is related to scattering at domain walls. and we demonstrate that we can reduce this through training by field cyclings.

To fit the need of different temperatures. scientists are looking for large intrinsic bandgap semiconductor materials so as to expand the exhaustion regions. We know the extremely small size of these particles will result in quantum confinement of the photo-generated electron–hole pair. leading to a blue shift in the absorption spectrum. Research studies are done on the doped nanocrystaline II-VI semiconductors to improve their emission activity [27-28]. Bulk ZnO is a well-known wide direct band gap (3.2 eV at room temperature) and high exciton binding energy (~ 60 meV) semiconducting material. ZnO is an II–VI semiconductor with properties similar to GaN. It is therefore a potential candidate for optoelectronic applications in the short wavelength range (green. blue. UV). information storage and sensors [1-7]. The high exciton binding energy of ZnO would allow for excitonic transitions even at room temperature. which could mean high radiative recombination efficiency for spontaneous emission as well as a lower threshold voltage for laser emission. Studies have been carried out to fine-tune the properties of ZnO to adopt it for different applications; for example. the band gap of ZnO is modified to use as UV detectors and emitters. The optical and electronic properties of semiconductors can be further tuned by varying the size of the particles in the range below 10 nm.

Under reaction conditions one expects that oxygen vacancies are present on the oxide catalyst surface and that their steady-state concentration depends upon the relative ratio of the oxidant (CO2) to the reductant (H2). We show that the activity of the catalyst is sensitive to the degree of surface reduction: a surface that is too reduced or too oxidized loses activity. Exposing the oxidized surface to CO2 and then to H2 produces no methane. while on a reduced surface methane is produced by exposure to CO2 followed by H2. If the reaction is carried out at the steady state. purged. and then exposed to only hydrogen. methane is produced. Methane is formed through the reaction of hydrogen with surface species. whose infrared spectrum is associated with a variety of surface carbonates. and not through CO or a formate intermediate.,True,NMtRLZU7b2oC:ssyqJ5znRdsC,96,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/cy/c4cy01106f,786223176664852364,/scholar?cites=786223176664852364,,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/getauthorversionpdf/c4cy01106f,0,0,0

A constant positive potential (chronoamperometry) is applied to Ce0.98Pd0.02O2−δ working electrode which causes Ce4+ to reduce to Ce3+ to the extent of ∼35%. while Pd remains in the +2 oxidation state. Electrochemically cycling this electrode between 0.0–1.2 V reverts back to the original state of the catalyst. This reversibility is attributed to the reversible reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ state.

An open question about the spillover mechanism is how a H atom binds to graphene instead of forming the thermodynamically preferred H2. Using ab initio calculations. we show that the catalyst saturation provides a way to the adsorption of hydrogen on the receptor by increasing the H chemical potential to a spillover favorable range. Although it is energetically unfavorable for the spillover to occur on a pristine graphene surface. presence of a phase of hydrogenated graphene facilitates the spillover by significantly improving the C−H binding.

It is based on the observation that the parameters of the equivalent circuit model to be fitted start degenerating as soon as the model order chosen is too high and over-fitting is taking place. Hence. a measure of the degree of degeneration is introduced and from this a criterion is developed with which over-fitting can be easily detected. Furthermore. it is shown. how the developed criterion can be used to automatically find an appropriate model order for any given impedance spectrum. Hereby. unambiguous test results are obtained irrespective of the specific expertise of the operator. Due to its ease of use the so improved test can serve as a quick standard test revealing defectiveness of measured impedance spectra.

Ltd,Vertical junction Si cell has shown a potential to operate at high concentrations. mainly the result of reduced series resistance losses due to its low‐current/high‐voltage design. but tests and analyses have so far only shown a modest efficiency of about 20%. We perform a comprehensive optimization study and show that the conversion efficiency of vertical multi‐junction (VMJ) cells can be significantly higher. close to 30% at concentrations of 1000 and higher. Reaching this efficiency requires junction dimensions that are significantly smaller than previous VMJ cells. This may require a different approach in the fabrication process. possibly by using a monolithic method rather than the wafer stacking approach. We also show that increased photoconductivity. which is usually negligible in conventional cells. produces a significant reduction in series resistance at high concentrations making it a significant contributor to …,True,RpSzLskAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,34,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.1118,5580147787115615969,/scholar?cites=5580147787115615969,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51331920/VMJ.pdf,0,0,0

However. in Photon Enhanced Thermionic Emission (PETE) solar energy converters. electrons that are reflected by the electric field in the gap return to the cathode with energy above the conduction band minimum. These electrons first occupy the conduction band from which they can be reemitted. This form of electron recycling makes PETE converters less susceptible to negative space charge loss.

Here. we report mesoscopic solar cells that incorporate a Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl)–based redox electrolyte in conjunction with a custom synthesized donor-π-bridge-acceptor zinc porphyrin dye as sensitizer (designated YD2-o-C8). The specific molecular design of YD2-o-C8 greatly retards the rate of interfacial back electron transfer from the conduction band of the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide film to the oxidized cobalt mediator. which enables attainment of strikingly high photovoltages approaching 1 volt. Because the YD2-o-C8 porphyrin harvests sunlight across the visible spectrum. large photocurrents are generated.

The ability of PPors to advance the oxidation state of the Ir(III)Cp* to Ir(IV)Cp*. as required for catalytic water oxidation. is demonstrated by combining electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). steady-state fluorescence and time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS) measurements. in conjunction with quantum dynamics simulations based on DFT structural models. Contrary to most other types of porphyrins previously analyzed in solar cells. our PPors bind to metal-oxide surfaces through axial coordination. a binding mode that makes them less prone to aggregation.

Various photon management schemes have been developed to enhance light absorption; one simple approach is to use randomly scattering media to enable broadband and wide-angle enhancement. However. such systems are often opaque. making it difficult to probe photoinduced processes. Here we use wave interference effects to modify the spatial distribution of light inside a highly scattering dye-sensitized solar cell to control photon absorption in a space-dependent manner. By shaping the incident wavefront of a laser beam. we enhance or suppress photocurrent by increasing or decreasing light concentration on the front side of the mesoporous photoanode where the collection efficiency of photoelectrons is maximal.

This compound was chosen to simplify analysis of the water oxidation catalyst species formed by the previously reported Cp*IrIII(pyalc)OH water oxidation precatalyst. Here. we present a comparative study on the chemical and catalytic properties of these two precursors. Previous studies show that oxidative activation of Cp*Ir-based precursors with NaIO4 results in formation of a blue IrIV species. This activation is concomitant with the loss of the placeholder Cp* ligand which oxidatively degrades to form acetic acid. iodate. and other obligatory byproducts. The activation process requires substantial amounts of primary oxidant. and the degradation products complicate analysis of the resulting IrIV species.

This paper proposes a generic framework for how monitoring programs can be developed and describes the planning and arrangement of a Norwegian monitoring campaign. The methodology aims to make it possible to establish a data-driven decision making process based on monitored decay related to climate change. This monitoring campaign includes 45 medieval buildings distributed over the entirety of Norway. Thirty-five of these buildings are dated to before 1537 and include wooden buildings as well as 10 medieval churches built in stone while the remaining 10 buildings are situated in the World Heritage sites of Bryggen. in Bergen on the west coast of Norway. and in Røros. which is a mining town in the inland of the country. The monitoring is planned to run for 30 to 50 years.

1134878,Heat pumps for conservation heating,2008,Tor Broström and Gustaf Leijonhufvud,,,,1143-1150,Technical university of Denmark,Conservation heating is used to control relative humidity in order to better preserve historic buildings and their interiors. The heating load for conservation heating when applied in a Nordic climate was characterized in order to investigate if and how air-to-air heat pumps can be used for conservation heating. Heating for conservation results in indoor temperatures that follow the seasonal variation of the outdoor temperature. Depending on the season and moisture load on the building. the indoor temperature will be 0-10 C higher than the ambient temperature. The heating load is much smaller and more stable over the year as compared to heating for comfort.

The objective of this study is to analyse the indoor climate. make a risk assessment and to propose interventions to improve the indoor climate with respect to the long term preservation of the collection. Relative humidity and temperature have been monitored within the castle for more than one year. Air exchange in selected rooms has been measured quarterly using diffusive sampling. The indoor climate is characterized by extremely low temperatures and high relative humidity in the winter. Even though the building does reduce the effect of outdoor variations. the variations in the indoor climate are larger than one would prefer in a museum. The primary risks associated with the indoor climate are mould growth. mechanical damages and chemical degradation. The variations in RH can be reduced by enhancing the effective hygrothermal inertia of the building through a reduction of the air exchange.

This is put to the point in designing and operating systems for indoor climate control in historic buildings. where competing objectives such as preservation. comfort. accessibility. energy use and cost have to be negotiated in the individual case. The overarching aim of this thesis is to explore the gap between research and practice regarding energy efficient indoor climate control in historic buildings. The thesis deals with historic buildings where both the building fabric and the movable collection are vulnerable and where the management of the building is more or less professionalized. Examples of such buildings are palaces. churches and historic house museums. ranging from the large and complex to the small and simple. A key to a more sustainable management of these buildings is to understand how scientific knowledge related to indoor climate control can become usable for the professional practitioner. The thesis comprises six published papers introduced by a thesis essay. The papers reflect a progression both in terms of the research questions and the methodology. The first three papers outline the background needed for a technical understanding of the involved matters through an identification of key knowledge gaps.

1134899,Kyrkobyggnader och klimatförändringar,2015,Gustaf Leijonhufvud and Tor Broström,,,,,Svenska kyrkan,Syftet med rapporten är att identifiera och värdera framtida inneklimatre-laterade risker i kyrkobyggnader på grund av framtida klimatförändringar samt att undersöka hur informationen om framtida risker kan användas. Vidare diskuteras styrkor och svagheter med befintlig fastighetsförvaltning med avseende på klimatanpassning. Undersökningen bygger på resultat från det europeiska projektet Climate for Culture där framtida risker. förknippade med klimatförändringar. pre-senteras i form av riskkartor. Som komplement till detta genomfördes en intervjuundersökning med ett tjugotal personer inom Svenska kyrkan som arbetar med fastighetsförvaltning.Undersökningen visar att risker för mögel och insektsangrepp ökar sig-nifikant medan andra risker. t ex mekaniska skador på bemålat trä. inte ökar. Följdfrågan blir då. vilka åtgärder kan eller bör vidtas i nuläget? För-fattarnas uppfattning är att klimatförändringarna förstärker betydelsen av förebyggande åtgärder och regelbundna kontroller för att förhindra innekli-matrelaterade skador. Vid långsiktiga insatser och investeringar. till exem-pel vid nyinstallation av uppvärmnings- eller avfuktningsanläggningar. bör kommande klimatförändringar beaktas vid dimensioneringen. Vidare borde Svenska kyrkan. i samverkan med andra nationella aktörer. överväga att införa ett program för långsiktiga uppföljningar av effekter på inneklimat och skador i kyrkor.,True,tVC3DiUAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,http://eprints.sparaochbevara.se/947/,,,,http://eprints.sparaochbevara.se/947/1/SKU%202015%201%20Bilagor%20Gemensamt%20ansvar%20en%20utredning%20om%20fastigheter%2C%20kyrkor%20och%20utj%C3%A4mningssystem.pdf,0,0,0

CfC has produced high-resolution thematic maps over Europe to highlight theexpected changes and related risks for a number of key materials. building types. deterioration mechanisms for the near and far future based on two emissionscenarios as developed by IPCC. The procedure to obtain a thematic map is asfollows: to simulate outdoor climate change; to pass from outdoor to indoor climatechange through building simulation and case studies measurements; to use damagefunctions and literature results to evaluate potential risk for buildings and objects; tomap the above results for advice and stakeholders use. This methodology hasproduced 55.650 thematic maps of future climate induced risks to historic buildingsand collections in their interiors.

Nonetheless. these buildings accommodate fragile and valuable movable and immovable objects. In the present article. a brief literature review of the risk of mechanical damages to art objects caused by fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity is given. Two cases are presented to illustrate the problems with indoor climates that deviates from common standards. The two cases were chosen because they are interesting from an energy saving perspective. The first case is an intermittently heated church in northern Sweden. typical for a Scandinavian rural church used only for services. The second case is a completely unheated building with an indoor climate closely following the fluctuations of the outdoor climate. including sub-zero temperatures in winter. The research about mechanical damages is discussed with reference to these cases. Two areas are identified where more research is needed. There is limited knowledge on the correlation between a fluctuating indoor climate and the risk of mechanical damages. ie the rate of temperature and relative humidity changes.

The full name. or title. of the project is Climate for Culture: damage risk assessment. economic impact and mitigation strategies for sustainable preservation of cultural heritage in times of climate change. This paper focusses on implementing high resolution regional climate models together with new building simulation tools in order to predict future outdoor and indoor climate conditions. The potential impact of gradual climate change on historic buildings and on the vast collections they contain has been assessed. Two moderate IPCC emission scenarios A1B and RCP 4.5 were used to predict indoor climates in historic buildings from the recent past until the year 2100. Risks to the building and to the interiors with valuable artifacts were assessed using damage functions. A set of generic building types based on data from existing buildings were used to transfer outdoor climate conditions to indoor conditions using high resolution climate projections for Europe and the Mediterranean. The high resolution climate change simulations have been performed with the regional climate model REMO over the whole of Europe including the Mediterranean region. Whole building simulation tools and a simplified building model were developed for historic buildings; they were forced with high resolution climate simulations. This has allowed maps of future climate-induced risks for historic buildings and their interiors to be produced. With this procedure future energy demands for building control can also be calculated.

1134916,Towards zero-emission refurbishment of historic buildings: A literature review,2018,Arian Loli and Chiara Bertolin,8,,2,22,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Nowadays. restoration interventions that aim for minimum environmental impact are conceived for recent buildings. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced using criteria met within a life-cycle analysis. while energy saving is achieved with cost-effective retrofitting actions that secure higher benefits in terms of comfort. However. conservation. restoration and retrofitting interventions in historic buildings do not have the same objectives as in modern buildings. Additional requirements have to be followed. such as the use of materials compatible with the original and the preservation of authenticity to ensure historic. artistic. cultural and social values over time. The paper presents a systematic review—at the intersection between environmental sustainability and conservation—of the state of the art of current methodological approaches applied in the sustainable refurbishment of historic buildings. It identifies research gaps in the field and highlights the paradox seen in the Scandinavian countries that are models in applying environmentally sustainable policies but still poor in integrating preservation issues.

Revue géographique des pays méditerranéens/Journal of Mediterranean geography,122,17-30,Presses Universitaires de Provence,This paper presents and discusses sea-level rise in Venice and past temperature changes over Italy during the Little Ice Age (LIA). through the analysis of proxies and early instrumental readings. Instrumental records are available from 1872 for sea level and from 1654 onwards for temperature but with a gap from 1670 to 1716. For earlier periods. documentary proxies have been used. In Venice. the most severe winters are known from written sources since the origin of the city ; furthermore. some paintings provide a view of the frozen lagoon. From 1500 to 1758. sea level has been reconstructed using two proxies : the algal belt visible in paintings by Veronese (16th century). Canaletto and Bellotto (18th century) and the submersion of the honour stairs of the historic palaces facing the Canal Grande. The depth of the lowest steps of the water stairs is correlated with sea level and constitutes a useful proxy. The result is that sea level in Venice rose at an exponential rate after the onset of global warming. The same can be said for the storm surges flooding the city. Concerning air temperature. written sources have been gathered from public and private libraries and archives. and the information has been transformed into indexed proxies from -3 (extreme cold) to +3° C (extreme warmth). 0 being normality. In general. documentary proxies are useful to pinpoint extreme weather or unusual periods on the short time scale.

This paper proposes a generic framework for how monitoring programs can be developed and describes the planning and arrangement of a Norwegian monitoring campaign. The methodology aims to make it possible to establish a data-driven decision making process based on monitored decay related to climate change. This monitoring campaign includes 45 medieval buildings distributed over the entirety of Norway. Thirty-five of these buildings are dated to before 1537 and include wooden buildings as well as 10 medieval churches built in stone while the remaining 10 buildings are situated in the World Heritage sites of Bryggen. in Bergen on the west coast of Norway. and in Røros. which is a mining town in the inland of the country. The monitoring is planned to run for 30 to 50 years. It includes a zero-level registration and an interval-based registration system focused on relevant indicators. which will make it possible to register climate change-induced decay at an early stage.

Revue géographique des pays méditerranéens/Journal of Mediterranean geography,,,Presses Universitaires de Provence,The paper reconstructs when the Lagoon of Venice. Italy. was frozen over in the last 1400 years. The paper combines various proxies and instrumental readings. i.e.: written documentary sources since the origin of Venice; evidence from visual arts referring to 1709. 1789 and 1791 as well as some pictures taken in 1929 and 2012; finally. instrumental observations since 1716. A critical revision has been made of all sources in order to reject duplications or exaggerations introduced by late compilations. To this aim the various dating styles. the social and historical context of the city of Venice over time and the combined historical. statistical and climatological criteria necessary to validate data have been considered. The physics of ice formation. the influence of tides. the ice bearing capacity have been useful to interpret data. The passage from proxies to index and temperature in modern units is also discussed. The written sources provide basic information before the instrumental period and made possible a classification of winter severity. The visual arts provide a general view of what happened when the Lagoon was frozen over in the 18th century; in addition. they allow an estimate of the ice slab thickness. Visual arts. however. cannot be used for dating purposes. Finally. the instrumental readings are compared with the proxies in order to improve the interpretation of the above proxies.

It is the reconstruction and interpretation of temporal and spatial patterns of climate in earlier centuries. There are distinct differences in the temporal resolution among the various proxies. Some of the proxy records are annually or even higher resolved and hence record year-by-year patterns of climate in past centuries. Several of the temperature reconstructions reveal that the late twentieth century warmth is unprecedented at hemispheric scales and is explained by anthropogenic. greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing.

Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of wind and water. Aeolian erosion occurs in windy regions with sandy terrain. but in urban areas it is extremely rare and is often confused with other forms of deterioration. The problem of condensation on surfaces and in pores is extensively discussed. in relation to pore shape and size. Physical effects dominate in the smallest pores. and solution effects in the largest ones. The Kelvin law and thermodynamic considerations are used to explain condensation-evaporation cycles and adsorption isotherms. Capillary rise. increase in pressure in air pockets. freezing-thawing cycles and micro meteorological conditions favorable for the soaking of monuments are discussed.

Apart from a chemical deterioration below the sufated crusts. which mainly grow outwards at the unaltered gypsum/carbonatic rock interface. another physical deterioration was observed.

In this paper the three different kinds of deterioration are described and interpreted in terms of the principal mechanisms leading to their formation. The way liquid water controls both the rate and the morphology of the deterioration crust formed on the stone as observed in the field. indicates that local rainfall is a critical factor in determining the type of deterioration. It appears that the different weathering observed actually depends on the way the interaction of rain with the surface occurs. at one extreme a complete washout of the surface. to the other where the surface is only very slightly wetted.The wetting resulting from moisture condensation on the stone surface appears to play a very minor role compared with that due to rainfall.,True,jc0RCdMAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,190,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004698182902967,6012238424183637977,/scholar?cites=6012238424183637977,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33417961/1982_Wetting_Crusts.pdf,0,0,0

A general formulation to express the different heat fluxes as a function of net radiation Φ is proposed. This relationship between the different heat fluxes and Φ can be expressed as a sum of three terms: the first indicates a direct proportionality to Φ. the second gives the deviation from linearity and depends on ∂Φ/∂t. and the third gives the value of the flux when Φ = 0. The formulae are then expressed as a function of time and the ratios between the heat fluxes and Φ are evaluated.

Toaldo (1781) through a reading error changed an X into II. transforming the year MDXI into MDIII. said that the artillery of Pope Giulio II crossed the frozen River Po (instead of the protected moat of the castle). The fact was then propagated by Easton (1928) as an independent event. in addition to the correctly reported event of 1511. The event thus created seemed to have all the characteristics of a'Great Winter'(much worse than it actually was) because the frozen river supported the crossing troops.The Italian archives supply a large quantity of information for the last millennium (Roccatagliata 1976; Veggiani 1986; Pavese and Oregor t 1985; Camuffo 1987. 1990) and a smaller amount of data for almost another millennium and a half.

This paper focusses on implementing high resolution regional climate models together with new building simulation tools in order to predict future outdoor and indoor climate conditions. The potential impact of gradual climate change on historic buildings and on the vast collections they contain has been assessed. Two moderate IPCC emission scenarios A1B and RCP 4.5 were used to predict indoor climates in historic buildings from the recent past until the year 2100. Risks to the building and to the interiors with valuable artifacts were assessed using damage functions. A set of generic building types based on data from existing buildings were used to transfer outdoor climate conditions to indoor conditions using high resolution climate projections for Europe and the Mediterranean. The high resolution climate change simulations have been performed with the regional climate model REMO over the whole of Europe including the Mediterranean region. Whole building simulation tools and a simplified building model were developed for historic buildings; they were forced with high resolution climate simulations. This has allowed maps of future climate-induced risks for historic buildings and their interiors to be produced. With this procedure future energy demands for building control can also be calculated.

One possible solution is the use of the moisture-buffering property of materials. In this study. the effects of the ventilation system and moisture-buffering properties of the building fabric on the stability of the indoor temperature and humidity are analysed by means of long-term field measurements. Indoor climate measurements were carried out in 170 detached houses (248 rooms).

Cost optimal energy performance levels. ie the energy performance leading to the lowest life cycle cost according to defined methodology. are implemented into new Estonian energy performance regulation as minimum requirements for new buildings. The regulation that came into force since 9 January 2013 includes requirements for nZEB buildings. but they are not mandatory. Compared to previous requirements. cost optimal requirements improve energy performance by 20%–40% depending on the building type and energy sources used. The results of the reference office and apartment building are reported. The results of the reference detached house. being previously reported. have been recalculated with new energy carrier factor for electricity. which was one major change in the regulation in addition to new requirements. When the detached house showed global cost curves with well-established cost optimal points. global cost curves were much more flat for the apartment and office building. This indicates that the results are sensitive to input data and relatively small changes in input data can significantly shift the cost optimal points. As uncertainties related to nZEB performance level and cost calculation are generally much higher due to high performance technical solutions not commonly used and costs not well established. it is recommended to repeat nZEB calculations with possibly refined input data before setting mandatory nZEB requirements.,True,VsYkM5cAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,38,http://vana.kirj.ee/public/Engineering/2013/issue_3/eng-2013-3-183-202.pdf,10347181222922486199,/scholar?cites=10347181222922486199,,http://vana.kirj.ee/public/Engineering/2013/issue_3/eng-2013-3-183-202.pdf,0,0,0

The potential effect of hygroscopic mass was assessed with the simulation of extreme cases. where permeable and hygroscopic lightweight structures with unfinished surfaces were compared with impermeable and non-hygroscopic ones. Measurements were conducted in 78 rooms of 46 newly built detached timber-framed houses and analyzed according to hygroscopic surface materials and envelope permeability. From the simulations. it was shown that permeable and hygroscopic structures considerably improved perceived air quality in summer. when a ventilation rate of 6 l/s pers. in the non-hygroscopic case corresponded roughly to 4 l/s pers. in the hygroscopic case. However. window airing and furnishing will reduce this difference in practice.

The flow is assumed to be turbulent or laminar and behave as bulk flow. i.e. the velocity and temperature is assumed to be uniform across the air gap and only a function of the height channel. Both the geometry of the air gap and the location of the solar cell module are varied. Aerodynamic end losses are taken into account but only buoyancy-induced flows are considered. The location of the solar cell panel is considered by introducing a configuration factor which is a factor varying between 0 and 1. Redistribution of heat by radiation within the air gap is dealt with.

Building energy analysis software was used to examine thirteen scenarios consisting of various combinations of four main retrofitting options: addition of extra insulation for building envelope. replacement of existing glazing. regulation of air infiltration rate and indoor set point temperature. These scenarios revealed that annual energy savings of up to 62% are achievable and that the customer payback period for the best retrofitting scenario is 34 years.,True,3B37kFwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1,https://openaccess.iyte.edu.tr/xmlui/handle/11147/10606,11760925941242272001,/scholar?cites=11760925941242272001,,,0,0,0

Energy-efficient ventilation such as demand-controlled ventilation and heat recovery ventilation can contribute to the aforementioned goals. if ventilation concepts and airflow distribution are planned and realized in a minimally invasive way. Compared to new buildings. the building physics of historic buildings are more complicated in terms of hygrothermal performance. In particular. if internal insulation is applied. dehumidification is needed for robust and risk-free future use. while maintaining the building’s cultural value. As each ventilation system has to be chosen and adapted individually to the specific building. the selection of the appropriate system type is not an easy task. For this reason. there is a need for a scientifically valid. systematic approach to pair appropriate ventilation system and airflow distribution solutions with historical buildings. This paper provides an overview of the interrelationships between heritage conservation and the need for ventilation in energy-efficient buildings. regarding building physics and indoor environmental quality. Furthermore. a systematic approach based on assessment criteria in terms of heritage significance of the building. building physics (hygrothermal performance). and building services (energy efficiency. indoor air quality. and comfort rating) according to the standard EN 16883: 2017 are applied.

Sweden,Periodic occupation of the mosque five prayer times per day throughout the year brings about the question: how can we improve prayers’ thermal comfort while preserving the heritage value? This paper investigates seasonal thermal comfort variations of a historic mosque in Mediterranean climate based on adaptive thermal comfort model by assessing different intervention strategies with specific attention on cultural heritage value. Salepçioğlu Mosque. located in Izmir-Turkey was monitored for thermal comfort parameters for one year. Calibrated dynamic model of the Mosque was created. Simulation results indicated that the mosque does not satisfy comfort levels for winter. while autumn is the most comfortable season. The utilization of an underfloor heating system is the most effective strategy in increasing seasonal comfort conditions by 55 percent in winter. while the night-time ventilation supports up to 6.1 percent in summer.,True,3B37kFwAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1296984/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1296984/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

In the process. the implementation of destructive techniques should be avoided and substituted with non-destructive approaches to prevent the destruction of their heritage significance. especially when energy efficiency is of interest. Although. infrared thermography. a nondestructive technique. is relatively time-efficient. it is rather labour-intensive for practical energy diagnostics. This is true since 2D thermal images have low spatial resolution and require an effort to understand what is being shown in the thermal image. Hence. many 2D thermal images and raw image processing are required to assess the situation. which is also time-consuming to prepare. In this study. a new 3D-aware smartphone methodology was deployed with an integrated infrared camera to obtain the 3D spatial reconstruction and thermal mapping of building interiors. This approach is for facilitating retrofit decision making in historic buildings. and therefore. distinguishing and eliminating energy efficiency measures that are distorting the heritage value of buildings. Results show that the system is capable of accurately generating a 3D spatial model of a room space in approximately five minutes and the resolution is sufficient to carry on detailed energy diagnostics.,True,VOOC07IAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1295330/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1295330/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

A general formulation to express the different heat fluxes as a function of net radiation Φ is proposed. This relationship between the different heat fluxes and Φ can be expressed as a sum of three terms: the first indicates a direct proportionality to Φ. the second gives the deviation from linearity and depends on ∂Φ/∂t. and the third gives the value of the flux when Φ = 0. The formulae are then expressed as a function of time and the ratios between the heat fluxes and Φ are evaluated.

Bulgaria after interventions for the conservation of frescoes,2000,Adriana Bernardi and Valentin Todorov and Julia Hiristova,1,Journal of Cultural Heritage,3,281-286,Elsevier Masson,A microclimatic field test was carried out in St. Stephan's church in Nassebar to check the actual microclimatic conditions before beginning the restoration of precious frescoes. painted on the internal walls and which date back to the end of the 16th century. Some years ago. a series of erroneous interventions caused heavy weathering of these frescoes. Successively. another series of structural changes were made on the basis of advice furnished by UNESCO. in order to prevent their further deterioration. Currently. the microclimatic conditions are good with only a few weak gradients in the main thermohygrometrical parameters. and the internal conditions are such that there is very little deposition of pollutants. A last series of structural interventions is necessary to eliminate the few remaining causes of perturbations in the internal microclimate.

For this reason. it is required to define the proper boundary conditions in terms of the different parameters affecting energy and comfort in buildings. They are also the basis for determining the ground temperature in different locations. as well as for determining the potential for using geothermal energy. This paper presents a database for climates in Europe that has been used in a freeware tool developed as part of the H2020 research project named “Cheap-GSHPs”. The standard Köppen-Geiger climate classification has been matched with the weather data provided by the ENERGYPLUS and METEONORM software database. The Test Reference Years of more than 300 locations have been considered. These locations have been labelled according to the degree-days for heating and cooling. as well as by the Köppen-Geiger scale. A comprehensive data set of weather conditions in Europe has been created and used as input for a GSHP sizing software. helping the user in selecting the weather conditions closest to the location of interest. The proposed method is based on lapse rates and has been tested at two locations in Switzerland and Ireland. It has been demonstrated as quite valid for the project purposes. considering the spatial distribution and density of available data and the lower computing load. in particular for locations where altitude is the main factor controlling on the temperature variations.

Historical perspectives on climate control strategies within museums and heritage buildings,2013,Andrea Luciani,,,,,,in italiano Il tema della ricerca è lo sviluppo di strategie di controllo del clima negli ambienti di conservazione. con particolare attenzione alle questioni inerenti l'analisi del clima interno negli edifici storici. Il controllo del clima in ambienti di conservazione posti all'interno di edifici storici. è un problema complesso che ha rilevanti conseguenze sulla conservazione del patrimonio culturale e che è generalmente caratterizzato da contrapposte necessità. Innanzitutto devono essere fornite delle condizioni termoigrometriche adatte alla conservazione delle opere d'arte: la questione su quali siano queste condizioni è stata dibattuta per secoli. D'altra parte l'introduzione di moderni apparati per il controllo del clima nei beni architettonici può portare a serie conseguenze per la loro conservazione. Tale questione divenne evidente con il progressivo restringersi degli intervalli consigliati di temperatura e umidità relativa. che ha favorito la diffusione del condizionamento dell'aria nei musei. Altri problemi sono legati al conflitto tra i requisiti termoigrometrici delle opere e quelli delle persone. che non sempre corrispondono. e. in tempi più recenti. al crescente bisogno di edifici sostenibili. sia nel senso di una maggiore efficienza energetica. sia nel senso di una riduzione dei costi di gestione. Tutte queste questioni sono riviste criticamente nella tesi tramite l'uso di una metodologia storica sviluppata a partire da una riflessione sul concetto di clima storico.

1135100,The historical indoor climate: A long-term approach to conservation environments within heritage buildings,2013,Mattias Legnér and Andrea Luciani,,,,1321-1328,Politecnico di Milano,The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of archival sources and architectural analysis in tracing the indoor climate history of an historic building such as an old museum. a church or a palace. References to past indoor climate have often been used either to defend status quo or to justify radical changes in the climate control of a building. The concept of historical climate can be used in many different contexts. In the field of conservation. it has recently been defined by the European standard EN15757: 2010 as the “climatic conditions in a microenvironment where a cultural heritage object has always been kept. or has been kept for a long period of time (at least one year) and to which it has become acclimatized”. Unlike many previous environmental standards. the priority is here not so much in specifying hygrothermal ranges. but in measuring the existing climatic conditions and in understanding whether the environment to which a cultural object has been exposed for a long period of time is harmful or not. As a consequence the focus should be shifted to the climatic history of the object. intended as the complex set of interactions developed throughout an extended period of time between a cultural object. its environment and the surrounding architecture. The term “conservation environment” introduced in this paper proposes a development of the analysis by including outdoor and indoor climate and the microenvironments which can influence buildings and artworks. When a cultural object is preserved within a historic building. further questions arise: which climate control strategies determined the conditions of conservation …,True,vBzIfdQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,3,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:665694,12503863313511227173,/scholar?cites=12503863313511227173,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:665694/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

The idea of built heritage as a common good is discussed along with the activity for its protection and is compared with the defence of other “weak subjects” against the globalised economic interest. The green movement and the protection of the natural environment have led conservation towards the paradigm of sustainable development and. more recently. to the concept of resilience. Some controversial outcomes of this contamination are here presented and discussed.

While the palimpsest approach has typically been used to map transformations of more traditional urban morphologies. this work focuses instead on remote extraction territories appropriated by the global economy and integral to planetary urbanization. The article suggests the central notion of ‘palimpsests of appropriation’as a lens to map the extraction processes. It does so in its multi-scalar and temporal dimensions and on the basis of the three intertwined frames—ie. the productive. distribution and mediation palimpsest—shortly exemplifying its use on the ground for the iron ore extraction territory in the Swedish-Norwegian Arctic. With this. the article contributes to the development of an expanded representational methodology and conception of territories of extraction—where social and natural production are brought together—illustrating how appropriation has been (re) shaping each of the frames throughout historical thresholds. but also how socio-natures are being (re) made in its image.,True,vBzIfdQAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC,1,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1450277,16137713500293692840,/scholar?cites=16137713500293692840,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450277/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

Cham,The town of Kiruna. founded in 1900 in the northernmost part of Sweden. is nowadays in the middle of an impressive urban transformation: due to the impacts of mining activities a large part of the city center has to be moved or rebuilt. Among the buildings to be moved and kept in use are some of the so-called ‘Bläckhorn’ timber houses. designed by Gustaf Wickman in the early 20th century as residential units for the workers of the mining company LKAB and part of the original core of Kiruna. This has raised several questions on the sustainability of renovating historic buildings in a sub-arctic climate. In order to explore the challenge of increasing the energy efficiency of the Bläckhorn houses. data on their constructional and historical features as well as their thermal and energy performance have been collected.

Despite being cited as a good passive preservation environment. conservators are observing decay in the collections related to the indoor climate that may call for a re-evaluation of the climate control strategy. Air exchange is generally considered one of the driving forces influencing the indoor climate in unheated historic buildings. This study was developed to better understand and evaluate its influence on the indoor climate stability of the castle. The present study has outlined an experimental procedure for the assessment of the influence of air exchange that can be used in historic buildings in general. Air exchange rate was measured in seven rooms using tracer gas passive sampling. The results were related to an analysis of the variability of indoor temperature (T). relative humidity (RH) and mixing ratio (MR). A connection with short-term RH fluctuations. considered the most dangerous for hygroscopic materials. was identified.

It is confirmed that a thorough analysis of each case is needed. since the cultural value of modern heritage risks being overwhelmed by the effort to improve its energy efficiency. The Urbino University Colleges are a masterpiece of the 20th century. They were designed by architect Giancarlo de Carlo. built between 1962 and 1983 and still host 1000 students. A conservation plan was outlined in 2016 with the aim of developing the long-term and sustainable preservation of such a huge complex. A specific goal in terms of sustainability was lowering the heating costs to save funds for conservation activities. The efforts were thus to balance building conservation. energy efficiency and users’ comfort. A thermal analysis. an energy retrofit design. a test on a pilot site. a comparison between before and after. are the tools that have been used to achieve this objective.

Singapore,Hardness is an important mechanical property which determines the applicability of polymer composites. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) invented by Iijima by arc-discharge technique. It possesses some unique properties like Young’s modulus. the values varies from 0.42 to 4.15 TPa. tensile strength of 1 TPa. density varies between 1.3 and 3 g/cm3 which is comparatively lower than commercial carbon fibers. This makes CNT as a potential reinforcement with metal and polymers for enhancement of properties. This work describes about preparation of PP-CNT composites with different ratios. Hardness of the composites were measured using Nanoindentation method and found that hardness of the PP-CNT system increases significantly with the increase of CNT proportion in the PP matrix. ,True,8OZ_oiEAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,5,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-1780-4_26,13474370934095024115,/scholar?cites=13474370934095024115,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pratik_Bhansali/publication/327389773_Experimental_Analysis_of_the_Influence_of_Combined_Heat_and_Cryogenic_Treatment_on_Mechanical_Properties_of_Steel_Select_Proceedings_of_ICEMMM_2018/links/5f9f312b299bf1b53e59ae92/Experimental-Analysis-of-the-Influence-of-Combined-Heat-and-Cryogenic-Treatment-on-Mechanical-Properties-of-Steel-Select-Proceedings-of-ICEMMM-2018.pdf#page=258,0,0,0

However. the straight use of biodiesel and vegetable oils in pure form results in several operational and durability problems in diesel engines because of their higher viscosity than fossil diesel fuel. One of the most used methods for solving the high viscosity problem is to blend them with fossil diesel fuel or alcohol. The reliable viscosity and density data of various biodiesel-diesel-alcohol ternary blends or biodiesel-diesel binary blends are plentifully available in existing literature. however. there is still the scarcity of dependable measurement values on different biodiesel-diesel-vegetable oil ternary blends at various temperatures.

However. the straight use of biodiesel and vegetable oils in pure form results in several operational and durability problems in diesel engines because of their higher viscosity than fossil diesel fuel. One of the most used methods for solving the high viscosity problem is to blend them with fossil diesel fuel or alcohol. The reliable viscosity and density data of various biodiesel-diesel-alcohol ternary blends or biodiesel-diesel binary blends are plentifully available in existing literature. however. there is still the scarcity of dependable measurement values on different biodiesel-diesel-vegetable oil ternary blends at various temperatures. Therefore. in this study. waste cooking oil biodiesel (ethyl ester) was produced. and it was blended with fossil diesel fuel and waste cooking oil at different volume ratios to prepare ternary blends. Viscosities and densities of the ternary blends were determined at different temperatures according to DIN 53015 and ISO 4787 standards. respectively. The variation in viscosity with respect to temperature and oil fraction and the change of density vs. temperature were evaluated. rational and exponential models were proposed for these variations. and these models were tested against the density and viscosity data measured by the authors.

Although the reasons of epilepsy are not fully known. the diversity and variability of the individual make it difficult to diagnose epilepsy. For this. the diagnosis of epilepsy with computerized systems is one of the most popular research topics in recent years. Although many techniques and methods have been developed for this purpose. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are one of the most preferred and most basic ways to diagnose epileptic seizures or epilepsies because of their practicality and easy application.

A busca do homem na produção de conhecimento que possa melhorar suas condições de vida não é nova. Ela remonta um período anterior aos filósofos gregos passando pela idade média e modernidade. Assim a ciência pode ser caracterizada como a tentativa do homem entender e explicar racionalmente os fenômenos procurando formular leis que forneçam principalmente a explicação e a predição (CHERUBINI NETO. 2002. ANDERY et al. 2004. CARVALHO. 2005. KÖCHE. 2006. POPPER. 2006). Segundo Popper (2006. pág. 61)“As teorias são redes. lançadas para capturar aquilo que denominamos mundo: para racionalizá-lo. explicá-lo. dominá-lo.”. As questões sobre a forma de produção do conhecimento são antigas e se revelam com diferentes abordagens (LAKATOS. 1978).Nas bases para a consistência das “redes” que capturam a realidade estão os métodos científicos e seus procedimentos. Nesse sentido pode-se dizer que “o método científico é um conjunto de concepções sobre o homem. a natureza e o próprio conhecimento. que sustentam um conjunto de regras de ação. de procedimentos. prescritos para se construir o conhecimento científico”(ANDERY et al. 2004).

São Paulo, Brazil",,,,The ecosystem approach has been widely used in the organizational theory along the past decades both in the scientific community and the business environment (DE VASCONCELOS GOMES ET AL.. 2016). The broad concepts of dynamics and interdependencies are attributes which brings our attention to the ecosystem perspective and justifies a deeper investigation about this subject.Moore (1993; 1996) was the first1 to make the term “(business) ecosystem” gain projection. proposing the stages of maturity framework. The idea of different phases of maturity is valuable because it says that depending on the maturity stage an ecosystem is immersed in. it will face different challenges. In other words. an action that was made at a certain point and worked well at that given time. could not be suited anymore in another context. Adner and Kapoor (2010) emphasized the importance of the complementors to the success of an innovation. It is not enough for an organization to overcome his challenges if the rest of the ecosystem’s actors do not surpass their own obstacles as well. This concept of complementor helped understanding how the relation of cooperation and competition works inside an ecosystem. Due the fact that complementors do not have any contractual obligation they have to work together with coordination (ADNER. 2006) based on trust (ADLER. 2006).

It took Vargas’ 1930 dictatorship to bring about Brazilian engineering                 . Engineering in the Brazilian context became more than buildings and machines. It emerged as the core of institutional innovations. as a tool of a national development                  project. It bloomed in the late 1950s. leading to almost half a century of accelerated industrialization                 . A peculiarity of this contextualized process was the leading role of graduate studies over undergraduate education. and its emphasis on …,True,-bSqBW0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-16169-3_4,8464040019149477894,/scholar?cites=8464040019149477894,,http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/13057/1/141.Steen%20Hyldgaard%20Christensen.pdf#page=129,0,0,0

As disposições de resíduos devem ser feitas em espaços e sob condições adequados de modo a minimizar os impactos socioeconômicos e ambientais. Nesse contexto. este artigo teve por objetivo estimar o potencial de recuperação energética de RSU usando modelos de simulação matemática para a biodigestão anaeróbia e a incineração. Como objeto de estudo. foram considerados os resíduos dispostos no aterro sanitário de Caieiras. localizado no município de Caieiras (SP). Para avaliação da biodigestão anaeróbia. foram analisados modelos matemáticos que permitem estimar a produção de metano em função dos diversos fatores que interferem no processo (concentração de acetato e de micro-organismos. variação do pH. entre outros). No caso da incineração. foram considerados modelos matemáticos empíricos (baseados nas análises imediata. gravimétrica e elementar) para estimar o poder calorífico inferior dos RSU. De acordo com os resultados obtidos. para a biodigestão anaeróbia seria possível obter potência média de 38.8 MW. Caso a incineração fosse adotada como método de tratamento dos RSU. seria possível obter potência elétrica média de 214 MW (considerando a incineração de 100% dos resíduos). Com base nas simulações realizadas para a biodigestão anaeróbia e a incineração como possíveis métodos de destinação dos RSU. conclui-se que o processo de incineração apresenta potencial de geração de eletricidade aproximadamente …,True,-bSqBW0AAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC,1,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1413-41522019000200347&script=sci_arttext,14206370838967289334,/scholar?cites=14206370838967289334,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1413-41522019000200347&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

Cham,Herbert Simon’s perception of the fundamental unity of design activities and the associated notion of sciences of the natural and of the artificial are put into dialogue with Billy Vaughn Koen and Joan van Aken through the device of “three blind certainties”: (1) that engineering is applied science; (2) that engineering is one of the sciences of the artificial; (3) that the advancement of engineering comes from the advancement of science. Simonian vocabulary is a stepping-stone for these three blind certainties. Koen offers a Rortyan redescription that redefines the possibilities of our understanding of engineering. proposing a vocabulary of his own to expose these certainties. Van Aken qualifies. but reaffirms these certainties. refining Simonian vocabulary to broaden its reach in support of an agenda for design research.

GPO Box 1729. Adelaide 5001. South Australia,BackgroundThe University of Southern Queensland (USQ) is a large distance education provider in eastern Australia with 80% of its 26000 students studying by distance or online education. USQ supports high levels of flexibility in its programs of study by ensuring that students have opportunities for equitable learning experiences no matter where or when they are studying. Building on this flexibility. Tablet PCs and related technologies allow new and faster delivery and communication methods for mathematics teaching. This means that for online and distance education. student learning experiences can go beyond simple text formats to all symbolic and graphical alternatives to be rapidly built and disseminated. The authors commenced research into the usability and functionality of Tablet PCs in 2004 when Tablet PCs and graphics Tablets (a USB-connected device with a stylus to enable the user to hand-draw or write on the screen) were used to teach large lecture groups of students studying first year mathematics. In late 2006. USQ funded a project to further investigate their potential in large mathematics and statistics first year courses offered on-campus and at a distance. In 2007 the project was extended beyond mathematics teaching and the research has to date involved a total of 10 staff. including the disciplines of Engineering. Chemistry.

The paper shares preliminary findings. the views of participants and recommendations for future activity. To design and conduct the trial. an action research method was chosen because it is participative and grounded in experience. reflecting the context and objectives of the trial. In the first phase of the trial. students in postgraduate Education courses were linked across the globe to participate in interactive and collaborative conference activity and to communicate via audio. text. and video and shared whiteboard. Mathematical problem-solving was carried out collaboratively in an undergraduate course using tablet PCs. This was followed by phase 2. a university-wide trial across disciplines. Preliminary findings indicate that web conferencing software enables teachers and students at the university to engage actively across diverse locations. supporting a student-centred approach and greater flexibility in terms of where. when and how students learn.

Adequate representations of leaves are therefore required for the modelling of plants. Such representations may be important to generate a realistic visualisation. or they may be used to study biological processes such as photosynthesis and canopy light environment. Accurate leaf surface representations are rarely found in the plant modelling community. This paper aims to show how detailed. accurate representations of leaf surfaces can be created from data; representations that may then be used as parts of virtual plants for applications in fields as diverse as the arts. agriculture or computer games. The techniques used here are mathematical methods of surface fitting applied to data that has been sampled from real leaves with a laser scanner (Polhemus FastSCAN 3D). These methods are interpolating finite element techniques. one using linear triangular elements. the other piecewise cubic triangles. The size of a laser scanned data set can be enormous and it may be important to represent the surface with significantly fewer points. An incremental algorithm is therefore used to identify significant points that result in a surface fit that approximates the entire data set to a pre-specified accuracy.The algorithms are applied to two examples. a Frangipani leaf and a Flame Tree leaf. Figure 1 visualises results for the Flame Tree leaf.

1135333,Surface fitting for the modelling of plant leaves,2004,Birgit Ilka Loch,,,,,,Leaves play a vital role in the development of a plant. as they are major resource collectors. Adequate models of leaves are therefore required for the modelling of plants. Such models may be used for visualisation purposes only. or they may incorporate leaf function such as photosynthesis. While the modelling of plant architecture has been researched extensively over the last decades. models of leaf surfaces have mostly not been generated with great accuracy or level of detail. and have often been handcrafted. This thesis aims to provide techniques for the creation of detailed. accurate models of leaf surfaces for the plant modelling community; models that may be used as parts of virtual plants for applications in fields as diverse as the arts. agriculture or computer games. These techniques are mathematical methods of surface fitting based on data that has been sampled from real leaves.First. leaf data needs to be collected. The digitising of leaf surfaces is described in detail in this thesis. and issues arising for three data collection techniques are discussed. The laser scanner is selected to sample data from leaf surfaces of four example leaf types. The two surface fitting methods which are applied to the data are finite element interpolation approaches. Since the size of a laser scanned data set can be enormous. an incremental algorithm is used to identify significant points that result in a surface fit that approximates all remaining data points to a specified accuracy. Interpretation of the positions of these points leads to the formulation of guidelines that describe the locations of significant points on a leaf surface.

In Australia. the uncapping of university places by the Government from 2012 (with one explicit aim to increase the number of students from non-traditional backgrounds) may lead to an influx of students that are mathematically less prepared.

Surface data can often be collected at a discrete set of points and a key problem is to reconstruct the surface. or perhaps capture important features of the surface from a discrete set of measurements. The modelling of plant architecture has been researched extensively over the last decades (Room et al. 1996. Prusinkiewicz 1998) and models of leaf surfaces have generally not been generated with great accuracy or level of detail. until recently when (Loch 2004) presented two methods to accurately model leaf surfaces. Leaves play an important role in the development of a plant. and therefore some adequate representation of the leaf is required. This representation may be used for visualization purposes only (Loch 2004) or may be used to study biological processes such as photosynthesis (Sinoquet et al. 1998) and canopy light environments (Espana et al. 1999).Virtual plants are developmental plant models that combine geometrical and topological information that can be used to produce a visualization (Room et al. 1996). Few of the past leaf models were based on accurate measurements until 3D digitizers and faster computers with improved graphic capabilities became available. Virtual leaf models may be displayed in an abstract way. where the leaf is represented by a disk (Smith 1984). polygons and texture maps (Foley et al. 1982) or. more realistically. by a surface model that captures the surface shape and boundary (Prusinkiewicz et al. 1990).

Numerical experiments demonstrate the expected high spectral accuracy for smooth solutions. Furthermore. it is shown that finite difference preconditioning can be successfully employed to construct an efficient iterative solver. Then the convection–diffusion equation is considered.

Data collection and classification have thus been inseparable. The advent of laser profile scanners. such as the Polhemus FastSCAN. means that 3D plant data can be captured holistically. The data acquired from laser surface scanners is in unordered point cloud form. with points collected only on the surface of the object under study. This means that the structure of the plant must be extracted from the cloud of 3D coordinates using manual methods.

Since the ticks have multiple life stages and can utilize a large range of host species our understanding of the dynamics of these infections is often not clear. In this paper we consider the impact of a population which is a tick host but non-viraemic on one which is both a tick host and viraemic. We present two simple deterministic models and use joint threshold density curves to illustrate the basic reproductive ratios of both the ticks and the virus. We find that the non-viraemic hosts can have considerable impact on the viraemic host. Either they amplify the tick population and cause the virus to persist. or they dilute the infection and cause it to die out.

Pockets of infection cause heavy mortality and the infection probably persists as a consequence of immigration of susceptible hosts. Seroprevalence is positively associated with temporal variations in vectors per host. although variation between areas is associated with the abundance of mountain hares. The presence of alternative tick hosts. particularly large mammals. provides additional hosts for increasing tick abundance.

Covertly infected individuals do not die as a result of infection. although they may be affected sublethally such that their reproductive output falls. they may transmit the covert infection vertically and. crucially. they may convert at some rate to overt infectious individuals.

These nematodes exhibit many characteristics that make them ideal candidates as biological control agents of insect pests (rapid host death. high reproductive rates. easily mass‐reared in vitro. easy application techniques). 2.  However. at present. the number of pest species to which these nematodes are applied successfully is small. Clearly. there is a need to develop existing knowledge of the nematode into a more complete understanding of the nematode–pest system as a whole. 3.  To consider the potential of entomopathogenic nematodes as biological control agents. we adopted a generalized analytical modelling approach and. using realistic parameter estimates. determined the conditions under which these nematodes can …,True,elB5rFQAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,30,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00494.x,7078261710813501975,/scholar?cites=7078261710813501975,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00494.x,0,0,0

However. many pathogens exhibit cyclic abundance patterns (e.g.. seasonality). and temporal asynchrony between interacting pathogens could reduce the impact of those interactions. Here we use an extension of our previously published model to investigate the effects of cycles on pathogen interaction. We demonstrate that host immune memory can maintain the impact of an interaction. even when the effector pathogen abundance is low or the pathogen is absent. Paradoxically. immune memory can result in pathogens interacting more strongly when temporally out of phase. We find that interactions between species can result in changes to the temporal pattern of the affected species. We further demonstrate that this may be observed in a natural host‐pathogen system.

Mathematical models have previously been used to describe the dynamics of these infections. However it has recently come to light that there is an alternative mechanism for the transmission of these diseases that has not been considered in a modelling framework. This is transmission through ticks co-feeding on non-viraemic hosts. This paper extends a simple mathematical model to include this alternative transmission mechanism. The model is used to describe the dynamics of Louping ill virus in red grouse (the viraemic host) and hares (the non-viraemic host). However. these results are applicable to many other systems. The model is analysed using joint threshold density curves. It is found that the presence of a non-viraemic host allows the virus to persist more readily than it would in the presence of a host that …,True,elB5rFQAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,28,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-002-0183-5,57975718916357545,/scholar?cites=57975718916357545,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47510738/The_role_of_non-viraemic_transmission_on20160725-27585-1e9wg7b.pdf,0,0,0

Forcing can bring about coexistence when previously there was exclusion; it can excite massive system response through resonance. it can offset the negative effect of apparent competition and it can change the conditions under which the system can be invaded. Our main focus is on the invasion properties of continuous time models under periodic forcing. We show that invasion is highly sensitive to the strength. period. phase. shape and configuration of the forcing components.

We present a model in which transmission from chronically infected hosts causes chronic infection in naive individuals. without causing acute disease – indeed ‘protecting’ against it. Thus the pathogen obtains the benefit of virulence (high transmission rate). but mitigates against the cost (high host mortality). Recent findings suggest that rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). a highly contagious and virulent pathogen. may also utilize this alternative. ‘avirulent’. mode of transmission. The model may resolve the paradox of how RHDV can be highly prevalent in some populations. in the absence of mortality.

We introduce the concept of bubbling of an attractor. a new type of intermittency that is triggered by low levels of noise. and demonstrate numerical and experimental examples of this behaviour. In particular we observe bubbling near the synchronised state of two coupled chaotic oscillators. We give a theoretical description of the behaviour associated with locally riddled basins. emphasising the role of invariant measures. In general these are non-unique for a given chaotic attractor. which gives rise to a spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. The behaviour of the attractor depends on the whole spectrum.

Using the symmetry of the network. we find dynamically invariant regions in the phase space existing purely by virtue of their spatio-temporal symmetry (the temporal symmetry corresponds to phase shifts). We focus on arrays which are symmetric under all permutations of the oscillators (this arises with global coupling) and also on rings of oscillators with both directed and bidirectional coupling. For these examples. we classify all spatio-temporal symmetries. including limit cycle solutions such as in-phase oscillation and those involving phase shifts. We also show the existence of “submaximal” limit cycle solutions under generic conditions. The canonical invariant region of the phase space is defined and used to investigate the dynamics.

Such rate-dependent tipping. or R-tipping. need not be associated with either bifurcations or noise.

Focussing on transitive (strongly connected) networks that have only one type of cell (identical cell networks) we address three questions relating the network structure to dynamics. The first question is how the structure of the network may force the existence of invariant subspaces (synchrony subspaces). The second question is how these invariant subspaces can support robust heteroclinic attractors. Finally. we investigate how the dynamics of coupled cell networks with different structures and numbers of cells can be related; in particular we consider the sets of possible “inflations” of a coupled cell network …,True,naUN7kQAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,89,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-010-9083-9,5660095424273278441,/scholar?cites=5660095424273278441,,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/4440/Dynamics%20of%20Coupled%20Cell%20Networks%20Synchrony%20Heteroclinic%20Cycles%20and%20Inflation.pdf?sequence=6&isAllowed=y,0,0,0
1135397,On riddling and weak attractors,2000,Peter Ashwin and John R Terry,142,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,1-2,87-100,North-Holland,We propose general definitions for riddling and partial riddling of a subset V of R m with non-zero Lebesgue measure and show that these properties are invariant for a large class of dynamical systems. We introduce the concept of a weak attractor. a weaker notion than a Milnor attractor and use this to re-examine and classify riddled basins of attractors. We find that basins of attraction can be partially riddled but if this is the case then any partial riddling must be evident near the attractor. We use these concepts to aid classification of bifurcations of attractors from invariant subspaces. In particular. our weak attractor is a generalisation of the absorbing area investigated by other authors and we suggest that a transition of a basin to riddling is usually associated with loss of stability of a weak attractor.,True,naUN7kQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,87,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278900000622,10382575083027788273,/scholar?cites=10382575083027788273,,https://old-collections.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/21193/on%20riddling.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

We investigate such a heteroclinic network between partially synchronized states where the phases cluster into three groups. For the coupling considered there exist 30 different three-cluster states in the case of five oscillators. We study the structure of the heteroclinic network and demonstrate that it is possible to navigate around the network by applying small impulsive inputs to the oscillator phases. This paper shows that such navigation may be done reliably even in the presence of noise and frequency detuning. as long as the input amplitude dominates the noise strength and the detuning magnitude. and the time between the applied pulses is in a suitable range. Furthermore. we show that. by exploiting the heteroclinic dynamics. frequency detuning can be encoded as a spatiotemporal code.

At the point of loss of stability. the most positive Lyapunov exponent of the natural measure on A crosses zero at what has been called a ‘blowout’bifurcation. We introduce the notion of an essential basin of an attractor A. This is the set of points x such that accumulation points of the sequence of measures 1 n∑ n− 1 k= 0 δ f k (x) are supported on A. We characterise supercritical and subcritical scenarios according to whether the Lebesgue measure of the essential basin of A is positive or zero. We study a drift-diffusion model and a model class of piecewise linear mappings of the plane. In the supercritical case. we find examples where a Lyapunov exponent of the branch of attractors may be positive (‘hyperchaos’) or negative. depending purely on the dynamics far from the invariant subspace.

Ltd,Bidirectional transport of early endosomes (EEs) involves microtubules (MTs) and associated motors. In fungi. the dynein/dynactin motor complex concentrates in a comet‐like accumulation at MT plus‐ends to receive kinesin‐3‐delivered EEs for retrograde transport. Here. we analyse the loading of endosomes onto dynein by combining live imaging of photoactivated endosomes and fluorescent dynein with mathematical modelling. Using nuclear pores as an internal calibration standard. we show that the dynein comet consists of ∼55 dynein motors. About half of the motors are slowly turned over (T1/2: ∼98 s) and they are kept at the plus‐ends by an active retention mechanism involving an interaction between dynactin and EB1. The other half is more dynamic (T1/2: ∼10 s) and mathematical modelling suggests that they concentrate at MT ends because of stochastic motor behaviour.

This is an area-preserving map of the torus to itself that is linear except on a line on which it is discontinuous. We discuss the closure of the set of images of the discontinuity and present numerical evidence that its Lebesgue measure is positive. Moreover. we present evidence that the measure of the closure of images of the discontinuity changes continuously with the parameter k. This means that the sawtooth standard map may exhibit coexistence of two positive measure subsets on which the dynamics is respectively regular and irregular in a certain sense.

These slow oscillations are due to the appearance of structurally stable heteroclinic connections between cluster states in the noise-free dynamics. In the presence of low levels of noise they give rise to long periods of residence near cluster states interspersed with sudden transitions between them.

Although these states are typically observed in large ensembles of oscillators and analyzed in the continuum limit. chimeras may also occur in systems with finite (and small) numbers of oscillators. Focusing on networks of 2 N phase oscillators that are organized in two groups. we find that chimera states. corresponding to attracting periodic orbits. appear with as few as two oscillators per group and demonstrate that for N> 2 the bifurcations that create them are analogous to those observed in the continuum limit.

However. there is a need to understand the long-term impacts that energy relations have politically. economically and physically. and their linkages between resilience. sustainability and security. We analyse the Finnish-Russian energy relations as a case study. as they are characterised by a non-conflictual relationship. To assess this complex relationship. we apply the interdependence framework to analyse both the energy systems and energy strategies of Finland and Russia. and the energy security issues related to the notable import dependence on one supplier. Moreover. we analyse the plausible development of the energy trade between the countries in three different energy policy scenarios until 2040. The findings of the article shed light on how the trends in energy markets. climate change mitigation and broader societal and political trends could influence Russia’s energy trade relations with countries. such as Finland. Our analysis shows that Finland’s dependence on primary energy imports does not pose an acute energy security threat in terms of sheer supply. and the dependence is unlikely to worsen in the future. However. due to the difficulty in anticipating societal. political. and economic trends. there are possible developments that could affect Finland.

Resource-wise. Russia has all the potential to become a leader both in renewable energy production and consumption. as well as a major exporter of bioenergy. This potential and the goal to enhance renewables has been clearly recognized and stated in the Energy Strategy of Russia up to 2030 (hereafter ES-2030; Ministry of Energy RF 2009: 9). Russia has all the potential of developing all available modern renewable energy sources—from solar. wind and small-scale hydro to geothermal and bioenergy. Due to geographic. economic. institutional and political constraints this potential has so far been little utilized.The focus in this chapter is on the security implications of an increasing potential of Russian—EU energy trade in Russian renewable energy resources. which raises new questions of energy interdependency between the EU and Russia. Judging by the political initiatives of the EU. energy security has become one of the most central topics in Europe during recent years (Cameron 2009: 20). The EU’s stance on energy security is understandably dualistic. On the one hand. the EU is worried about its future energy supply and. for example. the EU—Russia Energy Dialogue (2011) is mainly constructed along this line. On the other hand. diversification of the EU’s energy mix is becoming as much a central topic as the diversification and security of supply.

This practice is not unique globally and has firm historical roots in post-socialist space. Developing sports facilities is a prime example and one way that Gazprom has sought to craft a positive image for itself throughout Russia. However. the way these amenities are chosen and produced as part of Russian national gas program. Gazifikatsiya. raises questions about the positive connotations accorded to the chosen amenities and how they are utilized to control and govern the Russian populace from afar. Accordingly. this chapter will scrutinize the stateenterprise–population relationship by looking at the construction of sports facilities tied to the all-Russian gas program via a case study from one Russian region. Karelia.By studying the words and deeds of Gazprom’s governmentality through its Gazifikatsiia program. it is possible to unravel how power. truths. and identities are being constructed in and through energy networks. Pivotal to this study is the understanding that the materialities. spatialities. and infrastructures related to energy constitute a form of agency.

The planning discourse. which was reconstructed primarily with the help of 14 thematic interviews undertaken in St Petersburg. is positioned on the axes of the triangle of planning contradictions. The analysis shows that the promoted planning paradigm – the interpretations about the priorities of environmental planning – stem from the expert-centred approach of the Soviet era. and poorly suits the changing governmentality of St Petersburg. Due to regime changes. a significant step from a mute to a reflective governmentality was taken in St Petersburg. but the professional planning discourse is in conflict with this context reality and prohibits a more sustainable planning standpoint from developing.,True,H7R8Wd0AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,11,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09640560903529485,12134867551641298040,/scholar?cites=12134867551641298040,,,0,0,0

1135432,Planning rationalities among practitioners in St Petersburg. Russia–Soviet traditions and Western influences,2009,Veli-Pekka Tynkkynen,,,,,na,In this chapter I will examine how planning discourse has changed in St Petersburg after the collapse of the Soviet Union by analysing practitioners’ views in St Petersburg. 1 My analysis will shed light on the planning objectives and practices that are prioritised in St Petersburg planning. but also in Russian planning. since many of the abovementioned planners have practised their profession in several Russian cities. In addition to describing and analysing planning both in St Petersburg and more generally in Russia. I will also show how these objectives and priorities are related to Western planning theory and practice.While analysing the planning discussion. I use a methodology of discourse analysis. keeping in mind the physical. cultural and political geography of the locality. For example. the specific geographic location of the St Petersburg region does have a particular effect on the way local knowledge and thus discourses are produced. Especially in postSoviet St Petersburg. Russian and Soviet ideas have been linked with European influences much more than in many other Russian regions. owing to the specific geographical position of the city as ‘the window to Europe’. This kind of research on Russian urban and regional planning is not widespread–neither in Russia nor in the West. Gaining access to the roots of planning goalsetting is difficult even in the West (eg Flyvbjerg 2003. 325). so it is not a surprise that research of this type is marginal in Russia. Moreover.

1135438,The Crimea operation. Implications for future Russian military interventions,2014,Johan Norberg and F Westerlund and U Franke,,A Rude awakening. Ramifications of Russian aggression towards Ukraine,,41-50,,What can Russia’s operation in Crimea say about future military interventions? Our main conclusion is that it is feasible for Russia to. again. intervene or even illegally annex territory in neighbouring states. Most vulnerable are those bordering Russia and where Russia has military assets in the country. Several commentators have claimed that Russia displayed new military capabilities in Crimea. It did not. Russia has used special forces. proxies and propaganda before. The Crimea operation illustrates Russia’s ability for strategic coordination of military and non-military means. but not Russia’s military capability in terms of war fighting. Moreover. many factors favoured the Russian operation in Crimea.On 22 February 2014. Ukraine’s president Yanukovych fled Kiev. As a new government formed itself. tensions in Crimea rose. On 26 February. Russia’s Armed Forces began a major readiness exercise in the country’s Western and Central Military Districts (MD). The stated size of the exercise. 150 000 servicemen. was big enough to be a plausible invading force and a threat to the new Ukrainian government. It also worked as a military diversion. since Kyiv had to pay attention to it and was consequently less able to focus on events in Crimea.,True,Tq1x9TkAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,15,https://aff.a.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/A-Rude-Awakening-FOI-2014-06-.pdf#page=43,1595043601415914173,/scholar?cites=1595043601415914173,,https://aff.a.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/A-Rude-Awakening-FOI-2014-06-.pdf#page=43,0,0,0
1135439,4. The Defence Industry,2012,Fredrik Westerlundi,,Russian Military Capability in a Ten% Year Perspective º 2011,,65,,Historically. the defence industry has played an important role in Russian society. It has been argued that the Soviet Union did not have a militaryindustrial complex; rather it was one. 1 By the 2000s. however. it was becoming increasingly misleading to refer to a Russian military-industrial complex in terms of a defence industry. armed forces and defence industry ministries operating as a single. integrated entity. Signs of deep dysfunctionality were increasingly apparent. and by 2010 the long-standing rifts between the defence leadership and the industry. as well as within the industry. were out in the open. The sector was no longer the state’s primary focus; it had become a dependent–as opposed to a governing–variable vis-à-vis other policy areas.The defence industry nevertheless continues to play an important role. particularly in defence policy. in its capacity as developer and manufacturer of defence materiel. It also plays a crucial role in the Russian economy. Government defence orders. which accounted for just over 1 per cent of GDP in 2010. were projected to rise to 1.88 per cent in 2013. 2 To this must be added a significant volume of civillian products. The defence industry employed approximately 1.5 million people in 2009. 3 almost 1.5 per cent of the labour force. This gives the industry a role in domestic policy as well. To the population. it represents employment and social welfare. particularly in cities and regions dependent on defence industry contractors. Furthermore. successful sectors such as the space and aircraft industries are a source of national pride. These sectors also permit defence industry cooperation with other countries …,True,Tq1x9TkAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,15,https://www.academia.edu/download/30891844/foir_3474.pdf#page=66,2042822459501322547,/scholar?cites=2042822459501322547,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30891844/foir_3474.pdf#page=66,0,0,0

The first years of sweeping changes. such as reorganisation and personnel cuts. have been followed by a period of consolidation and. as of autumn 2013. adjustments are being made. such as testing new structures and adapting the Air Force’s new organisation. The political leadership’s ambitions regarding the Armed Forces. as seen through a will to retain the increased defence spending that has accompanied the reorganisation process. remain high and have started to materialise in terms of gradually increasing military capability.The aim of this chapter is to assess Russia’s military capability as of 2013. This will be done by describing and analysing the structures and nominal strengths of the Armed Forces and selected factors that influence military capability.

It is both a vital military-strategic asset for Russia and a serious liability. This determines the military force structure in Kaliningrad. as long as Russia and the West remain at loggerheads.Russia’s military posture in Kaliningrad Oblast has been strengthened in recent years. In the 1990s and early 2000s. the units deployed there were neglected–as were the Armed Forces in general. The Baltic Sea had become something of a security policy backwater. leaving the Baltic Sea Fleet adrift searching for a raison d’être. It was reduced to sending Naval Infantry units to the wars in Chechnya. spearheading integration of air defence assets and assisting in the construction of the Nord Stream pipeline. With the intensified effort to reform the Armed Forces after the 2008 war in Georgia. a gradual but steady modernisation of equipment and re-formation of units took place. including in Kaliningrad.

1135445,Russia and Ukraine: Military-strategic options. and possible risks. for Moscow,2014,Johan Norberg and Fredrik Westerlund,,"FOI, April",,,,A further Russian military intervention in Ukraine would not only be damaging to the security of both Ukraine and Europe. It could also entail significant military-strategic risks for Russia. reducing its military options in other strategic directions such as Central Asia and the Caucasus. While Russian officials still claim they have a onemillion-strong army. it may still face military-strategic overstretch should the Kremlin decide to launch extended combat operations in Ukraine. What are the reasons for this? What military options are available to secure Russia from perceived threats in its western strategic direction? What risks do operations beyond Crimea entail? A closer look at the military-strategic issues is warranted. beginning with the Russian threat assessment and peacetime military posture. however other Russian rationales for intervention in Ukraine–such as political and economic considerations–are excluded. Our analysis presupposes that Russia expects a large-scale military intervention in Ukraine to be challenged by armed resistance. This could be either in the form of regular Ukrainian armed forces units or. perhaps more likely. irregular military forces using partisan warfare methods; the capabilities of Ukraine’s armed forces. or any capabilities of notional irregular forces. are also not examined here.

1135451,6. Weapons of Mass Destruction,2012,Fredrik Westerlund and Roger Roffey,,,,135,Swedish Defence Research Agency. FOI,Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) have long been important for Russia’s military capability and for its claim to great-power status in the world. Nuclear. biological and chemical WMD have been seen in Russia as being very different in character. These weapons have both a practical and a symbolic function by virtue of their destructive potential. WMD have a clear political dimension alongside their purely military aspects. In this and previous reports. the subject has therefore been dealt with separately from conventional military capability (which is dealt with in Chapter 5. The Armed Forces).From a security policy perspective. it is important to assess both the development of Russian capability for the use of WMD and the phasing out of its former capability under the terms of international conventions. However. the focus differs between the different types of weapon. Where chemical weapons are concerned. the main question has long been Russia’s compliance with the requirements of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). principally the complete destruction of stockpiled chemical weapons. As regards biological weapons. the focus has been on compliance with international arms control agreements. For nuclear weapons. on the other hand. the capability for use overshadows questions of destruction and arms control. in particular in the assessment of Russian military capability in a ten-year perspective. That makes it also important to assess developments as regards the Russian early-warning system against nuclear attack.,True,Tq1x9TkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,1,https://www.academia.edu/download/31894892/Russian_Capability_in_a_Ten-Year_Perspective_-_2011.pdf#page=136,16963443416611082335,/scholar?cites=16963443416611082335,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31894892/Russian_Capability_in_a_Ten-Year_Perspective_-_2011.pdf#page=136,0,0,0

The article asks why there has been. and continues to be. relative peace in the SCS. despite the fact that many factors—as well as predictions by neo-realists and most U.S. policy analysts—point in the direction of military conflict The findings show that the relative peace is the result of two interlinked categories of processes: elite interactions and regionalization.

This article analyses the vital elements and thinking that guides Chinese foreign policy. its priorities and decision making process. It is found that China's foreign policy is embedded in domestic issues. The foremost foreign policy objective is domestic political stability. which in turn is a necessity for the survival of one-party rule. Both are dependent on a combination of two key factors: continuing domestic economic growth and nationalism. The foreign policy is also closely linked to the Chinese self-perception. both its self-superiority/self-inferiority dualism and its multitude of confusing (overlapping) identities about what China is and should be.

University of Warwick,This paper explores what benefits the theoretical development. operationalisation and implementation of conflict resolution can get from bridging with social movement theory. Four different social movement theories are included: the political process. resource mobilisation. collective behaviour-and the new social movement approach. For conflict resolution Peter Wallensteen’s theoretical approach is used. The analysis is limited to the post-Cold War period and intrastate conflicts (civil wars and state formation conflicts). This covers 95% of all post-Cold War conflicts. Four questions are asked and answered: 1. What does the link between social movement theory and conflict resolution look like?; 2. How can social movement theory benefit the development of conflict resolution theory?; 3. How can social movement theory benefit the operationalisation of conflict resolution theory?; 4. How can social movement theory and social movements be beneficial for the implementation of conflict resolution theory (ie conflict resolution)? The theoretical findings are tested on one case study (East Timor). The theoretical analysis shows that there exist a link between social movement theory and conflict resolution on all levels. The case study confirms the theoretical findings.,True,BS63JGMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,11,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:780143,354945779453695971,/scholar?cites=354945779453695971,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:780143/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

However. the success of the eU’s strategy requires a unified approach with clear prioritisation of areas where the eU realistically can have an impact. emphasis should be put on enhancing the bilateral trade and investment conditions. and pursuing principled polices in particular towards southeast asian nations that are going through a democratisation process. being a region with widespread ecological problems. the impact of knowledge and technology transfers would benefit the eU’s global interests in the environment. energy and climate change areas. as a more sustainable east asia would have direct impact on a global scale.When designing …,True,BS63JGMAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,9,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:780138,13016475679832284957,/scholar?cites=13016475679832284957,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:780138,0,0,0

There is an international. and not least a regional. fear that DPRK will acquire nuclear capability and the security consequences of this. It seems evident that DPRK has succeeded in developing rockets capable of delivering nuclear weapons and that this research has brought the North Koreans close to creating nuclear weapons. Many international actors and experts are certain that DPRK have. or is close to. developing nuclear weapons ready to strike targets outside DPRK. If these perceptions are founded in reality is difficult to asses as DPRK is an extremely closed society and little reliable information is accessible. The main question is however not so much if it has the competence. but rather how the perceptions regarding DPRK’s nuclear capability from the outside world is developing. It is the idea of a DPRK with nuclear capabilities and its impact on security and stability in the peninsula. the region. and internationally that is threatening. not necessarily the weapons by themselves. A great deal of effort has been invested. primarily by the Americans but also its allies. to prevent DPRK from acquiring nuclear capability and to create a peaceful future in the peninsula.

With survey results showing an offensive bias among 60 per cent of senior Swedish officers and as many as 80 per cent in the case of the army. it is clear that this is not just a problem of the past but is equally relevant today.

Drawing on existing research and the findings of a pilot study. ten propositions for why the offensive bias exists are tested using a mixed-method approach.

Each chapter opens with statistics on a key nation’s defence spending. its spending on defence R&D and on procurement over the period 1980 to 2017. allowing for an analysis of industry changes following the end of the Cold War. After the facts of each industry. the authors describe and analyse the structure. conduct and performance of the industry. The analysis of ‘structure’includes discussions of entry conditions. domestic monopoly/oligopoly structures and opportunities for competition. The section on ‘conduct’analyses price/non-price competition. including private and state funded R&D. and ‘performance’incorporates profitability. imports and exports together with spin-offs and technical progress. The conclusion explores the future prospects for each nation’s defence industry. Do defence industries have a future? What might the future defence firm and industry look like in 50 years’ time?

A better co-ordinated. less duplicative defence landscape was to emerge. to better serve the political objectives of European defence. However.

Member states all agree that defence industry and EDTIB are issues that need to be tackled and that synergies among civilian and military R&T are key to the future of this industry.However. once again. when it comes to details. especially regarding potential solutions. the states positions differ considerably.

Fyra stora exportaffärer av försvarsmateriel från Sverige har studerats. De fyra fallen är Saabs export av Gripen till Sydafrika. Kockums export av ubåtar till Australien. Kockums export av ubåtar till Singapore samt Hägglunds export av CV90 till Nederländerna.Studien visar att: varje köparland skapar unika krav och upplägg för genomförandet av militär offset; köparländerna vill t. ex. utnyttja offset till att skapa arbetstillfällen och att öka den inhemska försvarsindustrins konkurrenskraft; den största delen av produktutvecklingen sker hos det säljande företaget; en stor del av produktionen sker i Sverige.,True,2txx0yYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,4,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1143484,2340997505734940432,/scholar?cites=2340997505734940432,,,0,0,0

Light hydrocarbon solvent injection is an alternative to steam injection that has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with recovery. However. the pore-scale behavior of the solvent-bitumen system is very complex and poorly characterized to date. In this work. a high-pressure high-temperature micromodel with reservoir-relevant geometry combined with imaging tools provides a pore-scale window into solvent injection methods using propane and butane. The combination of two-phase dynamics and solvency at the condensing edge leads to significant bitumen production. similar in both propane and butane injections.

These mechanisms are diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) and reaction limited aggregation (RLA). Each mechanism has its own characteristics and acts on limited values of asphaltene concentration. At the asphaltene concentrations below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). the DLA mechanism is dominant. while at concentrations above the CMC. at the initial stage of aggregation process. the RLA mechanism is observed and then the mechanism tends toward DLA (crossover behavior).

Operational stability was enhanced via the introduction of a polymer-based gas diffusion layer that sandwiches the reaction interface between separate hydrophobic and conductive supports. providing constant ethylene …,True,Dgdo64MAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC,611,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/783.abstract,3662738513090137271,/scholar?cites=3662738513090137271,,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/90350/1/CO2%20electroreduction%20to_TSpace.pdf,0,0,0

Fluorescence microscopy is used to provide ex situ visualization of liquid water transport through the GDL placed beneath an optically transparent clamping plate. Transient image data obtained with a CCD camera indicates that areas of compression in the GDL coincide with preferential pathways for water transport and break-through. Preferential flow of water through the smaller pores resulting from GDL compression is contrary to the expected behaviour in a hydrophobic medium. and this suggests a loss of hydrophobicity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to investigate the effect of compression on the morphology of the GDL. These SEM images show that compressing the GDL causes the breakup of fibers and. indeed. deterioration of the …,True,Dgdo64MAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,332,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775306019252,5439860369919168140,/scholar?cites=5439860369919168140,,,0,0,0

Implications of the tunable meso-/microporosity on the spatial distribution and catalytic performance of metal–acid sites in Mo/lamellar MFI catalysts were studied. The number of free Brønsted acid sites increases linearly. accompanied by a linear decrease in Mo dispersion. with decreasing external surface areas in catalysts. The Mo–acid active sites coexisted on the external surface or mesopores of the catalysts linearly depends on the hierarchy factor. being the product of relative micropore volume and relative external surface area. The reaction rate and product selectivity of Mo/lamellar MFI in direct methane aromatization reactions are consistent with the trends of changes in zeolite porosities.

This method combines the advantages that the polymer chains collapse and entangle in the presence of compressed CO2. which acts as antisolvent. and the metal nanoparticles and polymers can be precipitated simultaneously from micellar solutions by the easy control of CO2 pressure. Ag/polystyrene (PS) nanocomposites have been successfully prepared using this method. The transmission electronic micrographs (TEM) of the obtained nanocomposites show that the smaller Ag nanoparticles are immobilized by PS nanospheres of about 50 nm; the phase structure was characterized by X‐ray diffraction (XRD).

Hydroxyapatite (HAP) membranes are synthesized by multistage crystallization onto palladium. The synthesis involves three steps: electrochemical deposition of HAP seeds. secondary hydrothermal crystallization onto the seed layer to promote c‐axis growth normal to the substrate. and tertiary hydrothermal crystallization to promote a‐axis growth to fill the gaps between the aligned crystals. The c‐axis alignment with crystal domains spanning the membrane thickness significantly enhances proton conduction since protons are primarily transported along the c‐axes of HAP crystals.
