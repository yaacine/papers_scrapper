1051805,Use of colour parameters for roasted coffee assessment,2012,Natalina Cavaco Bicho and António Eduardo Leitão and José Cochicho Ramalho and Fernando Cebola Lidon,32,Food Science and Technology,3,436-442,,Fast and non-destructive indicators were evaluated as tools to measure the technological quality of Arabica and Robusta coffee. Accordingly. considering the roasting intensity in highly valuable commercial samples. volume. mass. apparent density. moisture. total ash. ash insoluble in hydrochloric acid. and ether extract were characterized. The chromatic parameters L*. C*. Hº were measured using illuminants D 65 and C. It was found that in roasted coffee beans. the parameters L*. C*. Hº. and coordinate b* had an antagonist interaction due to an increase in the roasting intensity. whereas after milling. only L* and Hº decreased progressively. Considering that the parameters L* and Hº followed similar patterns using both illuminants.

Therefore. the objective of this study was to evaluate the differential tolerance between genotypes of conilon coffee subjected to low availability of nitrogen in the soil. as well as the gains obtained with the addition of this nutrient in the soil through fertilization. Ten genotypes of Coffea canephora were cultivated in greenhouse. without fertilization with N and with fertilization at level of 0.625 g kg-1 of soil. tested in a completely randomized design. Based on the results of growth analysis and expression of variability between genotypes. the most appropriate level was selected to discriminate the genotypes for tolerance to low availability of nitrogen in the soil. Following this premise. the genotypes 67. 23 and 02 were classified as intolerant and the genotypes 32. 73. 83. 77. 76. 24 and 153 as tolerant to low availability of nitrogen in the soil.

In this context. the optimization of plants’ nutritional efficiency is critical to increase productivity and reduce the cost of agricultural production systems. The nutritional efficiency of plants is conditioned by numerous factors and the growing environment. Therefore. the knowledge of genetic basis and mode of inheritance can assist in selecting genotypes with desirable agronomic characteristics coupled with nutritional efficiency and genetic variability. The trend of expanding agricultural frontiers has increased interest in the use of genotypes with the potential to adapt to adverse conditions of soil fertility.

Modelling its deposition to evaluate its impact on ecosystems has been the focus of many studies. For that. universal indicators are needed to determine and compare the early effects of NH3 across ecosystems.2. We evaluate the effects of atmospheric NH3 in ecosystems using lichens. which are one of the most sensitive communities at the ecosystem level. Rather than measuring total diversity. we use a functional diversity approach because this is potentially a more universal tool.3. We evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of atmospheric NH3 concentrations ([NH3]atm) emitted from a point‐source over a 1‐year period in a cork oak Mediterranean woodland. We observed a temporal pattern of [NH3]atm. with maximum concentrations during autumn.4. The distribution of lichen …,True,YY3cC7IAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,95,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02033.x,6969687975575854909,/scholar?cites=6969687975575854909,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02033.x,0,0,0

In this study. five different fresh‐cut watermelon cultivars were assessed for their flesh and by‐product bioactive contents.RESULTS: The amount of by‐product varied between 31.27 and 40.61% of initial fresh weight (f.w.) depending on the cultivar. Watermelon cultivars were poor sources of total antioxidant. and the content was similar between rind and flesh samples (46.96 vs 43.46 mg ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity kg−1 f.w.). However. the rind had a moderate total phenolic content higher than that of the flesh (458 vs 389 mg chlorogenic acid equivalent kg−1 f.w.) and a much higher content of the amino acid citrulline (3.34 vs 2.33 g kg−1 f.w.). which has …,True,sjYGyUcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,117,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.4250,14210949080861038940,/scholar?cites=14210949080861038940,,,0,0,0

A variety of plant materials are known to be natural sources of antioxidants. such as herbs. spices. seeds. fruits and vegetables. The interest in these natural components is not only due to their biological value. but also to their economic impact. as most of them may be extracted from food by-products and under-exploited plant species. This article provides an overview of current knowledge on natural antioxidants: their sources. extraction methods and stabilization processes. In addition. recent studies on their applications in the food industry are also addressed; namely. as preservatives in different food products and in active films for packaging purposes and edible coatings.

Treatment indication for these lesions is surgical excision with appropriate prosthetic reconstruction. The hemostatic capacity of carbon dioxide (CO2) laser is well described in the literature as a useful tool in oral surgery. especially in patients with clotting disorders. This paper presents a case of a 72-year-old female patient referred to the 'Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Valongo Hospital' at Porto. Portugal. with a massive growth of vestibular oral mucosa in the mandible and maxilla associated with ill-fitting dentures. suggestive of epulis fissuratum. The patient was taking antithrombotic medication. The lesions were excised with CO2 laser. and no significant complications. such as hemorrhage. pain. swelling or infection. were recorded. Twenty days after surgery. both areas were completely reepithelizaded. Prosthetic rehabilitation and function were achieved with the fabrication of new maxillary and mandibular dentures. Follow-up 1 month and 1 year after treatment revealed the areas free of recurrence.

Ltd.,BACKGROUND: The first detailed chemical characterisation of Portuguese pine nut (Pinus pinea L.) is reported concerning proximate composition. fatty acid. mineral and vitamin contents.RESULTS: Based on the analysis of 27 different populations. pine nuts were characterised by high contents of fat (47.7 g per 100 g dry matter (DM)). protein (33.8 g per 100 g DM) and phosphorus (1130 mg per 100 g DM) and low contents of moisture (5.9 g per 100 g DM) and starch (3.5 g per 100 g DM). They were also found to be a good source of zinc. iron and manganese.CONCLUSION: Mineral composition seemed to be most prone to variation. suggesting its potentially useful role in discriminating Mediterranean pine nuts. A significant variability was found in the nut composition of Portuguese P. pinea populations.

Flours produced by milling fruits dried at different conditions were evaluated for colour. starch granules morphology. amylose and sugars content. The drying temperature was positively related to the reducing sugar content and negatively to starch content. The amilose content generally increased with drying temperature and the effect was more evident for the Q. rotundifolia. Results showed that flour colour parameters generally decreased with increased drying temperature. However. the drying temperature does not seem to affect starch morphology. It can also be stated that Q. suber produced darker flours. higher amylose and reducing sugar content. and bigger starch granules.

Quercus rotundifolia and Quercus suber by alkaline (A3S) and enzymatic (ENZ) methods and physical and functional properties were studied. The isolation method induced changes in most of those properties in the isolated starches. mainly in resistant starch content. syneresis. pasting. thermal and rheological properties. Isolated acorn starches presented high amylose content (53–59%) and resistant starch content (30.8–41.4%). Acorn starches showed limited and similar solubility values and swelling power values. showing a gradual increase from 60 °C to 90 °C. The pasting temperatures ranged from 67.5 to 72.0 °C and pastes did not present breakdown. which is suggestive of a high paste stability of acorn starches during heating.

Oxon: Routledge,,7-11,,Soccer is one of the most popular sports worldwide and a lot of research has been conducted on various aspects of this sport. Most of the relevant studies are based on elite or male participants (Mohr et al.. 2005) and there is little research about youth soccer players. With the increasing emphasis on talent development and the minimization of potential injuries among adolescent athletes. there is a consensus between coaches and sport scientists that a comprehensive. sport-specific investigation would aid in more clearly defining present levels of physiological fitness and sports skills specific to youth soccer (Vanderford et al.. 2004). Players must possess moderate to high aerobic and anaerobic power. have good agility. joint flexibility and muscular development. and be capable of generating high torques during fast movements (Reilly et al.. 2000). As soccer is a team sport. an efficient organization of the team is required for the optimal development of players’ abilities. the control of opponents. and the successful resolution of a match. Players are placed in certain positions to fulfil specific tasks. Significant differences in age. stature. body fat and body mass index have been recently identified between elite players of different playing positions suggesting that players with a particular size and shape may be suitable for the demands of the various playing positions (Bloomfield et al.. 2005).

Motivated by this dream. a large number of young soccer candidates look for the opportunity to be selected for the youth teams of soccer clubs. Many organizations and top level teams. national federations and club teams. invest considerable resources in an effort to identify exceptionally gifted athletes.

A number of factors such as maturation and training effect impact upon this development process.Potentially talented athletes must be considered in a dynamic and multidimensional view (Abbott and Collins. 2002; Vaeyens et al.. 2008). In addition. in order to avoid exclusion of many ‘promising’young players. the potential to develop must also be considered.

The experimental data obtained for the variations of moisture content along drying was fit to three thin layer models from literature with success. The experimental drying rate points were expressed as moisture ratio versus time.  The results obtained allowed concluding that some chestnuts had higher initial moisture content than others and also that the presence or absence of the peel did not influence the initial moisture content of the chestnuts from the different cultivars tested.

In the regions where small ruminants are important to the economy. the development of new products may and the diversification of the offer might represent good strategies to attract new consumers since it allows producers to go beyond the usual cheesemaking. Those were the reasons that led to the production of a yogurt that would include different proportions of sheep and goats milk. a final product with the right physicochemical quality properties and sensory attributes. The addition of sheep milk is meant to attract more and more potential consumers and to additionally improve the nutritional value of the product. mainly with respect to the amount of fatty acid and mineral contents. Consumers tend to prefer yogurts made of cow milk. but this work shows that people enjoy and accept yogurts produced with goat and sheep milk as well.

1052148,From soil to soil-less in horticulture: quality and typicity,2013,Rosario Di Lorenzo and Antonino Pisciotta and Pietro Santamaria and Valentina Scariot,,,,e30-e30,,In this review. the technique of soil-less cultivation of horticultural crops is analysed. the main differences between this and traditional cultivation techniques are described. and the advantages and disadvantages of each method in relation to the others are identified. Soilless cultivation has revolutionised various sectors of vegetable and floriculture production. and recent years have also seen interest being shown by Italian fruit crop producers. particularly those involved in table grape viticulture. The various issues related to the use of this technique are described in relation to the needs of the substrate. water management. and mineral nutrition of the different species. and to the fact that not all species are suitable for the application of soil-less cultivation. Finally. since the soil-less system is strongly influenced by Man and is increasingly conditioned by this. the links between the final product and the territory where it is grown appear to be very limited. This is particularly true in Italy where. for certain protected geographical indication food products. soil-less cultivation is prohibited.,True,NNQXJfcAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,29,http://www.agronomy.it/index.php/agro/article/view/541,15162736541136893330,/scholar?cites=15162736541136893330,,https://www.agronomy.it/index.php/agro/article/download/ija.2013.e30/511/,0,0,0

Bean size and numbers of normal and aborted seeds were characters with a certain degree of polymorphism. The low between-year variability observed suggests that differences in the variables could be attributed to genetic factors. A high year-to-year variation was observed only for the number of aborted seeds. Seed characteristics showed small changes both between years and among cultivars. Out of all the variables.

Flower abscission induced independently by shade and gibberellic acid (GAc) sprays was monitored in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) growing under a soilless greenhouse system during two seasonal growing conditions. in an early and late production cycle. Physiological and metabolic changes triggered by each of the two distinct stimuli were determined. Environmental conditions exerted a significant effect on fruit set as showed by the higher natural drop rate recorded in the late production cycle with respect to the early cycle. Shade and GAc treatments increased the percentage of flower drop compared to the control. and at a similar degree. during the late production cycle. The reduction of leaf gas exchanges under shade conditions was not observed in GAc treated vines. The metabolic profile assessed in samples collected during the late cycle differently affected primary and secondary metabolisms and showed that most of the treatment-resulting variations occurred in opposite trends in inflorescences unbalanced in either hormonal or energy deficit abscission-inducing signals. Particularly concerning carbohydrates metabolism. sucrose. glucose. tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolites and intermediates of the raffinose family oligosaccharides pathway were lower in shaded and higher in GAc samples.

In general. the removal of basal leaves before flowering reduces fruit set. hence achieving looser clusters. and improves grape composition since yield is generally curtailed more than proportionally to leaf area itself. Albeit responses to this practice seem quite consistent. overall vine performance is affected by genotype. environmental conditions and severity of treatment. The physiological responses of grape varieties to defoliation practices have been widely investigated. and just recently a whole genome transcriptomic approach was exploited showing an extensive transcriptome rearrangement in berries defoliated before flowering. Nevertheless. the extent to which these transcriptomic reactions could be manifested by different genotypes and growing environments is entirely unexplored. To highlight general responses to defoliation vs. different locations. we analyzed the transcriptome of cv. Sangiovese berries sampled at four development stages from pre-flowering defoliated vines in two different geographical areas of Italy. We obtained and validated five markers of the early defoliation treatment in Sangiovese. an ATP-binding cassette transporter. an auxin response factor. a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase. a flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase and an indole-3-acetate beta-glucosyltransferase.

South Italy) and its key role for cultivar and wildlife conservation,2011,Tommaso La Mantia and Francesco Carimi and Rosario Di Lorenzo and Salvatore Pasta,,Italian Journal of Agronomy,,e17-e17,,As occurred on many other small Mediterranean islands. agricultural activity at Lampedusa (Strait of Sicily) underwent a very strong decline in terms of surface area during the second half of the last century. In particular. cereal crops have ceased and horticulture is disappearing. while vineyards still occupy a reduced area but are quickly vanishing and currently survive thanks to a small number of old farmers. Here are presented the results of a research carried out by interviewing seven farmers in order to study not only the techniques and the germplasm used in local viticulture. but also the final use of grapes and an evaluation on the connection between traditional farming and agro-ecosystems plant species-richness. Vines were grown for wine. to produce fresh and sun-dried grapes. or to preserve them in alcohol. Several names of the local varieties suggest that they might have been introduced in Lampedusa from the neighbouring territories: being fishermen and farmers at the same time. local people had trade relationships with other Mediterranean areas such as Tunisia. Malta and Southern Italy. Furthermore. local farming plays a key role in plant conservation. In fact. the disappearance of agricultural systems is leading to the extinction of 43 plant species. some of them considered rare not only on the local level. but also on the regional and national one.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,1.2.3‐Triazole‐based polymers generated from the Cu(I)‐catalyzed cycloaddition between multivalent azides and acetylenes are effective adhesive materials for metal surfaces. The adhesive capacities of candidate mixtures of azide and alkyne components were measured by a modified peel test. using a customized adhesive tester. A particularly effective tetravalent alkyne and trivalent azide combination was identified. giving exceptional strength that matches or exceeds the best commercial formulations. The addition of Cu catalyst was found to be important for the synthesis of stronger adhesive polymers when cured at room temperature. Heating also accelerated curing rates. but the maximum adhesive strengths achieved at both room temperature and high temperature were the same. suggesting that crosslinking reaches the same advanced point in all cases.

However. calculations also show that the absorption maximum of the longitudinal plasmon resonance depends on the medium dielectric constant in a linear fashion for a fixed aspect ratio. Attempts to fit the calculations to the experimental values indicate that the medium dielectric constant has to vary with the aspect ratio in a nonlinear way.

As the optical absorption spectra of their solutions show only one plasmon absorption it is concluded that mixing of gold and silver leads to a homogeneous formation of alloy nanoparticles. The maximum of the plasmon band blue-shifts linearly with increasing silver content. This fact cannot be explained by a simple linear combination of the dielectric constants of gold and silver within the Mie theory.

However. the clinical application of inorganic formulations has often been hindered by their toxicity and failure to biodegrade. We describe here a transformable liquid-metal nanomedicine. based on a core–shell nanosphere composed of a liquid-phase eutectic gallium-indium core and a thiolated polymeric shell. This formulation can be simply produced through a sonication-mediated method with bioconjugation flexibility.

One facet of the probe features an array of gold optical antennas designed to enhance Raman signals. while the other facet of the fiber is used for the input and collection of light. Simultaneous detection of benzenethiol and 2-[(E)-2-pyridin-4-ylethenyl]pyridine is demonstrated through a 35 cm long fiber. The array of nanoscale optical antennas was first defined by electron-beam lithography on a silicon wafer. The array was subsequently stripped from the wafer and then transferred to the facet of a fiber. Lithographic definition of the antennas provides a method for producing two-dimensional arrays with well-defined geometry. which allows (i) the optical response of the probe to be tuned and (ii) the density of “hot spots” generating the enhanced Raman signal to be controlled.

Injecting low melting point alloys. such as eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn). into microchannels at room temperature (or just above room temperature) offers a simple way to fabricate microelectrodes. The channels that define the shape and position of the microelectrodes are fabricated simultaneously with other microfluidic channels (i.e.. those used to manipulate fluids) in a single step; consequently. all of the components are inherently aligned.

Several strategies exist to program materials to change from one shape to another; however. few can temporally and spatially control the shape. Programming the sequence of shape transformation with temporal control has been driven by the desire to generate complex shapes with high yield and to create multiple shapes from the same starting material. This paper demonstrates a markedly simple strategy for programmed self-folding of two-dimensional (2D) polymer sheets into 3D objects in a sequential manner using external light.

EMPs utilize electrowetting modulation of liquid contact angle in order to mimic the refractive behavior for various classical prism geometries. Continuous beam steering through an angle of 14° (±7°) has been demonstrated with a liquid index of n=1.359. Experimental results are well-matched to theoretical behavior up to the point of electrowetting contact-angle saturation. Projections show that use of higher index liquids (n~1.6) will result in steering through ~30° (±15°). Fundamental factors defining achievable deflection range. and issues for Ladar use. are reviewed. This approach is capable of good switching speed (~ms). polarization independent operation. modulation of beam field-of-view (lensing). and high steering efficiency that is independent of deflection angle.,True,XT0lBpMAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,261,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=OE-14-14-6557,3166539269527328143,/scholar?cites=3166539269527328143,,https://www.osapublishing.org/viewmedia.cfm?uri=oe-14-14-6557&seq=0,0,0,0

Films as thin as 10 nm thick have properties approaching those of existing electrodes based on indium tin oxide (ITO) but with significantly improved mechanical properties. In uniaxial tension. strains as high as 25% are required for permanent damage and at lower strains resistance changes are slight and consistent with elastic deformation of the individual CNTs. A simple model confirms that changes in electrical resistance are described by a Poisson's ratio of 0.22. These films are also durable to cyclic loading. and even at peak strains of 10% no significant damage occurs after 250 cycles. The scratch resistance is also high as measured by nanoscratch. and for a 50 μm tip a load of 140 mN is required to cause initial failure.

The widespread mantle argues against landscape‐scale glaciation in the Lesotho highlands in the Late Pleistocene.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In respect to the weathering of cave art exposed to the sun. cognizance has yet to be taken of the modified thermal conditions and the potential for endolithic biotic activity where the art is located on a light‐transmissive lithology. Where light penetrates rock. the light‐to‐heat transfer is not solely at the surface. and this leads to a thermal gradient that is different from where the paintings are located (and all transfer is at the surface). Light values of up to 200 W/m2 were recorded at 0.5 mm depth and up to 100 W/m2 at 1mm depth in the dry sandstone; rock moisture data showed that at this site the rock remained dry irrespective of atmospheric conditions. The light penetration means that there can be rapid and large subsurface thermal fluctuations contemporaneous with those at the rock surface. and that the thermal gradient is not as steep (approximately 1°C/mm in the surficial part of the rock) as where light‐to‐heat …,True,sd1z3-YAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,21,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gea.20296,3536610434423163655,/scholar?cites=3536610434423163655,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/gea.20296,0,0,0

1052909,Marion Island volcanism and glaciation,2011,Kevin John Hall and KI Meiklejohn and Adam John Bumby,,,,,Cambridge University Press,Sub-Antarctic Marion Island was the site of extensive volcanism as well as glaciation during both the Quaternary and the Holocene. Initial reconstructions suggested a link between deglaciation and the initiation of faulting which. in turn. facilitated lava eruptions during the interglacials. However. our reassessment of the faulting. volcanic rock. and palaeoglacier distribution indicate that these original interpretations were erroneous. Features thought to be due to faulting are shown to be erosional scarps and this significantly changes interpretations of former glacier distribution. Further. the loss of the former ice cap has revealed new information on former glaciers and their flow directions. thereby allowing reconstruction of palaeoglaciers. Our new reconstruction fits with information from invertebrate genetic mapping that suggest some lava outcrops were nunataks and. therefore. refuges during the Last Glacial period. The new findings of glacial landforms in areas previously covered by snow suggest there was a significant ice advance during the Little Ice Age. Although Holocene volcanic rocks overlie and mask much of the glacial evidence. it has been possible to develop a proposed new reconstruction for glaciation. which is presented together with some of the implications.,True,sd1z3-YAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,18,https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/18935,14743668412239707104,/scholar?cites=14743668412239707104,,https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/18935/Hall_Marion(2011).pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Morphological attributes show debris at the angle of repose on the rampart’s proximal slope and at a lower angle on the distal slope. Relative-age dating. based on the percentage moss cover and weathering rind thickness of the clastic component. indicates accumulation mainly on the proximal slope and rampart crest. implying upslope (retrogressive) accumulation. This contrasts with a previously published model for pronival ramparts. which proposes rampart growth by addition of material to the distal slope. Development of the Marion Island rampart is suggested to result from the control exerted by a relatively low-angled surface and a shrinking snowbed. A small debris step formed on the proximal slope appears to be a response to decreased snowfalls due to changing climate over the last c. 50 years. Growth rate of the rampart is considered to be variable during the Holocene in response to changes in climate and debris supply.,True,sd1z3-YAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,15,https://www.academia.edu/download/50584184/Formation_of_a_pronival_rampart_on_subAn20161127-18766-1f66n71.pdf,14256950381115937339,/scholar?cites=14256950381115937339,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50584184/Formation_of_a_pronival_rampart_on_subAn20161127-18766-1f66n71.pdf,0,0,0

The research presented in this discussion represents investigations to determine the extent of contemporary chemical weathering in an area that hitherto has not been investigated. A glacial outwash stream on southeastern Alexander Island was investigated to determine the extent of active chemical weathering. Data indicate that solution of minerals does take place during the Antarctic summer when water is present.

Antarctica encompasses some of the coldest. windiest and driest habitats on earth. Within the Southern Ocean. sub-Antarctic islands are found between the Sub-Antarctic Front to the north and the Polar Front to the south. Lying in a transition zone between warmer subtropical and cooler Antarctic waters. these islands are important sentinels from which to study climate change. 2 A growing body of evidence3. 4 now suggests that climatically driven changes in the latitudinal boundaries of these two fronts define the islands’ short-and long-term atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. Consequently. sub-Antarctic islands and their associated terrestrial and marine ecosystems offer ideal natural laboratories for studying ecosystem response to change. 5 For example. a recent study6 indicates that the shift in the geographical position of the oceanic fronts has disrupted inshore marine ecosystems. with a possible impact on top predators. Importantly. biotic responses are variable as indicated by different population trends of these top predators. 7. 8 When studied collectively. these variations in species’ demographic patterns point to complex spatial and temporal changes within the broader sub-Antarctic ecosystem. and invite further examination of the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic drivers.Further south. beyond the Polar Front. the Southern Ocean and Antarctica provide a unique platform from which to investigate …,True,sd1z3-YAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,5,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0038-23532017000300007,1897633731264520662,/scholar?cites=1897633731264520662,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0038-23532017000300007,0,0,0

We demonstrate that the shapes of the dose distributions can be used to assess the likelihood that aliquots consist only of grains that were well-bleached at the time of deposition. The more asymmetric the distribution. the greater the probability that the aliquots with the lowest dose most closely represent the true burial dose. Single grains with differing doses are present in each of the samples examined. and the population with the lowest dose gives an optical age consistent with the expected burial age.

It is shown for three laboratory-bleached Australian sedimentary quartz samples that the relative change in sensitivity of the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) during a repeated measurement cycle (consisting of a dose followed by a 10 s preheat at a given temperature and then a 100 s exposure to blue/green light at 125°C) is very similar to that of the 110°C thermoluminescence (TL) peak measured during the preheat cycle. The absolute change in the TL sensitivity with preheat temperature is different for samples containing a natural or a regenerative dose.

(1999. this volume). Here we present the results of this dating programme and argue that the artefact‐bearing sediments were deposited within the last 10000 years. This time interval is consistent with the radiocarbon chronology but is much younger than previous claims for initial human occupation during the Pleistocene. Analysis of individual grains revealed also that the characteristic saturation doses of some grains are unusually high. which may permit dating of deposits older than a few hundred thousand years.

In this study. aluminum was extracted using a novel roasting process with a low-cost recoverable reagent (ammonium sulfate;(NH4) 2SO4) combined to aqueous leaching. The results showed that the procedure could be successfully applied to recover aluminum and other strategic metals (eg vanadium) from their amorphous silicate matrix. The percentage recovery from the amorphous phase ranged from over 95% for aluminum to over 75% for vanadium. The recovery of the metals depended on the solid-solid ratio and the roasting temperature.

In Middle Pleistocene times. the banks of a small gully were repeatedly occupied by human groups leaving Acheulean and Sangoan material cultures in an interstratified pattern. Optical age determinations on aeolian intercalations within the gully sediments range between 220 and 150 ka. This sequence is truncated by Nile floodplain silts in which three occupation levels with Lupemban-related Nubian Complex assemblages (Van Peer. 1998) are stratified. The long archaeological sequence at 8-B-11 is a rare African case to document the Early toMiddle Stone Age transition by means of primary context situations in direct stratigraphic superposition (Clark. 2001; Tryon & McBrearty. 2002). In contrast to the Acheulean. the early MSA Sangoan levels show sophisticated behaviours involving considerable technological and symbolic investment. Quartzite cobbles were used in the grinding of vegetal materials. Yellow and red ochre were exploited and ground to pigments using shaped mortars and selected chert nodules.

It is characterised by appealing simplicity. Selective over hunting. facilitated by naiveté to human predation. produced rapid mass extinctions of large animals wherever subsistence societies colonised new landmasses. Taken at face value the circumstantial case for blitzkrieg is compelling and despite a paucity of direct evidence it has gained considerable support. Our review of the model suggests that it overlooks much contradictory data and rests on simplistic interpretations of complex biogeographicat and anthropological phenomena.

Amorphous silica occurs in significant amounts both in plants and in certain types of stone used to make lithic artefacts. Four stages of polish formation are derived from the glass polishing theory because they are useful for identifying mechanisms of how silica acts as a polishing agent. Amorphous silica is found to be an important polishing agent. even for wood with a very low silica content. Polishing agents may also contribute to polishes arising from stone tool contact with bone. skin. meat and shell. Implications are considered for flint. obsidian. quartz and other stone tool materials with use-polish. It is concluded that use-polish may be a less precise indicator of Australian contact materials than has been reported for other areas.,True,thi3JycAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,139,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305440391900762,10684084715601297408,/scholar?cites=10684084715601297408,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46399741/The_role_of_silica_in_Polish_formation20160611-25522-ikdkns.pdf,0,0,0

PIXE-PIGME analyses of the elemental composition of obsidian have made significant contributions to the study of resource use and distribution in the western Pacific region. More recently. detailed recording and systematic sampling of obsidian exposures combined with enhancements in the characterization technique itself have led to much finer discrimination between sources in New Britain.

In this chapter. we look at microscopic observations and other techniques that archaeologists employ to determine the function of things. Our primary interest is in the context and use of tools. but this is rarely an end in itself. Tools can potentially tell us about subsistence history. plant food preparation. craft production. weaponry. and other technologies. The determination of function is a fundamental step. but context is always important. Whether or not they are actually used for cooking or storage. ceramic pots or bronze jars can have stylized forms. decoration. and a ceremonial purpose. Intention may be difficult to reconstruct. but it is also an important element of functional analysis. Not even stone tools function in a world devoid of social meaning (Edmonds 1995). but with a handle on function we can better understand other influences on artifact variability (such as personal. stylistic. and other constraints).Implements are not only identified by signs of utilization. but sometimes by observed use. ethnography. patterned production. purposeful shape. or design (see Kamminga 1985). Nor do they have to be actually made by people (as implied by the Latin root of the word “artifact”). A stick thrown at a dog is a kind of artifact. Ethnographic studies show that some manufactured tools have no purposeful or planned shape. and sustain no clear macroscopic traces of use. despite intensive work (White & Thomas 1972; Hayden 1977). The by-products of implement manufacture (stone axe production. for example) can also be used as expedient tools (Burton 1989).

1053147,The role of thermal stress fatigue in the breakdown of rock in cold regions,1999,Kevin Hall,31,Geomorphology,1-4,47-63,Elsevier,Many geomorphological studies have ignored the role of thermal stress fatigue. Engineers have long maintained that thermal stress is an effective process. Physicists and the ceramics industry have provided a theoretical foundation to explain the nature and mode of operation of thermal breakdown. Recent geomorphological studies have shown the importance of thermal stress in cold regions by means of high-frequency rock temperature data which can identify rates of temperature change in excess of ≥2°C min−1. The occurrence of weathered material in cold but dry regions can be explained by thermal stress/shock.

As a result of this approach. the process focus in terms of weathering has been that mechanical processes predominate. with freeze-thaw weathering as the prime agent. and that chemical processes are temperature-inhibited. often to the point of nonoccurrence. Here a reconsideration of the whole conceptual framework of weathering in cold environments is undertaken. It is shown that. contrary to popular presentations. weathering. including chemical weathering. is not temperature-limited but rather is limited by moisture availability.

1053151,New insights into rock weathering from high-frequency rock temperature data: an Antarctic study of weathering by thermal stress,2001,Kevin Hall and Marie-Françoise André,41,Geomorphology,1,23-35,Elsevier,A major limitation of many weathering studies has been the acquisition of rock temperature data at insufficiently frequent intervals for the meaningful determination of the rate of change of temperature (ΔT/t). Equipment and/or logistical constraints frequently facilitate temperature measurement at only hourly intervals or. at best. every 10 min. Such data are not adequate for the determination of ΔT/t required for the evaluation of the freeze–thaw mechanism or thermal stress fatigue. Recent undertakings at different sites in Antarctica (and at other cold-region locations) provide rock temperature measurements at 1-min intervals. which indicate that the perception of the weathering regime would be very different from that generally assumed from longer-interval geomorphological data. These data clearly show that thermal stress fatigue and thermal shock may be more active components of the Antarctic weathering regime …,True,XEwDS-AAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,169,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X01001015,14190975934228881044,/scholar?cites=14190975934228881044,,,0,0,0

Antarctica,1997,Kevin Hall,8,Permafrost and Periglacial Processes,1,69-90,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd,A principal tenet of cold region weathering studies is that of temperature. Unfortunately. despite the appearance to the contrary. actual data are still sadly lacking in many instances. Here data are provided for the best part of two Antarctic winters plus. at two minute resolution. for one summer. from a variety of positions within a dry valley. The data clearly show the dangers of using air temperature as a surrogate for thermal conditions either at the rock surface or at depth in the rock. Although detailed rock moisture data are absent in this study. indirect evidence from both observation and non‐destructive ultrasonic testing shows that water is extremely limited during the period of freeze–thaw cycles. Thus. despite the occurrence of the thermal events no damage can result from frost action. Detailed data at two minute intervals show the importance of such high resolution observations.

However. given their complexity and                 purported significance in landform development. neither has received the scientific                 scrutiny merited. Nivation is generally associated with the weathering and mass                 movement processes stemming from late-lying seasonal snow and the ensuing landforms.                 As a process suite it invokes mechanisms such as freeze-thaw weathering and                 solifluction. Cryoplanation also invokes a process suite. but one that also embraces                 nivation.

This study presents moisture content values for rocks. taken from a variety of positions and conditions. in the maritime Antarctic. Additional information regarding the amount of water the rock could take up. as observed from laboratory experiments. is also presented. The results show that the approaches used in simulation experiments. particularly that of soaking a rock for 24 hours. may produce exaggerated results. It was found that the saturation coefficient (S‐value) was a good indicator of frost susceptibility (based on water content) but that the derivation of that value may underestimate the potential of some rocks.

The uneven heating of a rock body may cause buttressing of the heated faces such that thermal stresses are accentuated. Upon removal of the heat source. rapid cooling may occur and values of Δt may be sufficient to cause thermal shock.Replications of these thermal stresses may lead to fatigue and failure. The zone within which these stresses may occur is also one within which freeze‐thaw can take place if water is present.

The basic question. or ‘riddle of the wrist’. is as follows: do hominins show morphological commitment in the radial carpometacarpal and carpal region of the hand to tool behaviors such that a) the ancestral morphology is sacrificed. and b) the derived morphology has performance advantages for the behavior (ie. it is better than the primitive structure with respect to the novel behavior)? If so. when. in which hominins. and in which behavioral contexts did this event most likely occur? The three-dimensional quantitative evidence presented indicates that this ‘riddle of the wrist’is solvable. The solution may be found in the trapezoid and the bones with which it articulates. In certain species of Homo (ie. H. sapiens. H. neanderthalensis. and H. antecessor). the radio-ulnar expansion of the palmar aspect of the trapezoid results in supination of the trapezium such that the distal carpals are more aligned with one another. This re-alignment of the wrist occurs along with a complete reconfiguration of the joint morphology in the radial carpal and carpometacarpal region. This complex of derived features shows biomechanical advantages for withstanding large forces that are directed radio-ulnarly across the palmar aspect of the wrist during strong contraction of the thenar musculature. The morphological specialization of the radial wrist is a hallmark of H. sapiens. H. neanderthalensis. and their most recent common ancestor. The evidence presented indicates that the distinct morphology of the complex …,True,BdDS1HUAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,46,https://www.paleoanthro.org/media/dissertations/Matthew%20Tocheri.pdf,4830983124205233049,/scholar?cites=4830983124205233049,,https://www.paleoanthro.org/media/dissertations/Matthew%20Tocheri.pdf,0,0,0

Although the humerus appears fairly modern in most regards. it is remarkable in displaying only 110° of humeral torsion. well below modern human average values. Assuming a modern human shoulder configuration. such a low degree of humeral torsion would result in a lateral set to the elbow. Such an elbow joint would function more nearly in a frontal than in a sagittal plane. and this is certainly not what anyone would have predicted for a tool-making Pleistocene hominin. We argue that Homo floresiensis probably did not have a modern human shoulder configuration: the clavicle was relatively short. and we suggest that the scapula was more protracted. resulting in a glenoid fossa …,True,ma1JwaoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,124,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248407001170,9303503679466522194,/scholar?cites=9303503679466522194,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49815249/Homo_floresiensis_and_the_evolution_of_t20161023-28382-xcuftn.pdf,0,0,0

Conduction parameters can therefore be evaluated from linear sweep voltammetry data on the further assumption that charge transport occurs via a hopping mechanism. From cyclic voltammograms the density of states at the Fermi level is estimated at 0.6 states/(eV polaron). Similarly the mobility is of the order of 0.2 m2 V−1 s−1.

Thermite reactions are difficult to start as they require very high temperatures for ignition. e.g. for Al–CuO thermite comprising micron particles it is ca. 940 °C. It was found that the ignition temperature is significantly reduced when the binary Si–Bi2O3 system is added as sensitizer. Further improvement is achieved when the reagents are nano-sized powders. For the composition Al + CuO + Si + Bi2O3 (65.3:14.7:16:4 wt.%). with all components nano-sized. the observed ignition temperature is ca. 613 °C and a thermal runaway reaction is observed in the DTA.,True,INwHJUx8QW8C:ZeXyd9-uunAC,46,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591010004729,1686867695701789332,/scholar?cites=1686867695701789332,,https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/15875/Ilunga_Effect(2011).pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Enhanced photo‐oxidation is a possible route to accelerate the mineralisation of such litter. Thus we evaluated the effect of selected metal complexes and an anti‐oxidant on the accelerated weathering of blown polyethylene and polypropylene films in a QUV tester. It was found that the additives were more effective in polypropylene than in polyethylene. The transition metal complexes. particularly ferric stearate. were very effective photodegradants. Copper stearate provided a measure of UV protection to polyethylene but not to polypropylene. Poly (1.2‐dihydro‐2.2.4‐trimethylquinoline). a commercial anti‐oxidant. also caused accelerated UV degradation.

Expandable graphite was used instead of an inert gas to “foam” the pitch. The resulting foam was subjected to a series of heat treatments with the objective of first crosslinking the pitch. and thereafter carbonizing and graphitizing the resulting foam. XRD confirmed that the graphitization at 2600 °C resulted in a highly graphitic material. The porosity of this foam derives from the loose packing of the vermicular exfoliated graphite particles together with their internal porosity. During the foaming process the pitch tends to coat the outside surface of the expanding graphite flakes. It also bonds them together. The graphite foam prepared with 5 wt.% expandable graphite had a bulk density of 0.249 g cm−3. a compressive strength of 0.46 MPa and a thermal conductivity of 21 W m−1 K−1.

Compared to the uncoated powders. the BET surface area was lower. the powder packing density was improved. and the thickening effect on white oil was significantly reduced. The latter two observations are rationalized in terms of a reduction in the attractive interactions between the powder particles. The viscosity of white oil slurries containing 25 wt% solids showed shear-thinning non-Newtonian behavior. The coated powders showed significantly lower viscosities at low shear rates although the difference diminished at high shear rates. The lower viscosities shown by the coated powders indicate that the surface modification facilitated the break-up of agglomerates and the dispersion of individual particles in the fluid.,True,INwHJUx8QW8C:UebtZRa9Y70C,42,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-009-3844-6,9631911823202019174,/scholar?cites=9631911823202019174,,https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/15739/Focke_Influence(2009).pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Cone calorimeter results. at a radiant flux of 35 kW m−2. revealed that adding only 5 wt.% expandable graphite lowered the peak heat release rate from 325 ± 11 kW m−2 to 63 ± 23 kW m−2 and the total heat release from 55 ± 11 MJ m−2 to only 10.7 ± 0.3 MJ m−2. All samples containing expandable graphite ignited and burned only very briefly before flame out. The remarkable effectiveness of the expandable graphite is attributed to an excellent match between the exfoliation onset temperature of the graphite and the onset of decomposition of the PVC. This means that the exfoliation of the graphite forms a protective barrier layer at the right place at the right time. In addition. the simultaneous release of halogen species by the polymer matrix and the exfoliating graphite prevents the formation …,True,INwHJUx8QW8C:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,38,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391013004291,3139862868582606493,/scholar?cites=3139862868582606493,,https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/39765/Focke_Flexible_2014.pdf;sequence=1,0,0,0

Suitable stabilization to render these alternative insecticides longer lasting could provide a less controversial and more acceptable and effective alternative insecticide formulations than DDT. This study sought to investigate the reasons behind the often reported longer lasting behaviour of DDT by exposing all the WHO approved insecticides to high temperature. high humidity and ultra-violet light. Interactions between the insecticides and some mineral powders in the presence of an aqueous medium were also tested. Simple insecticidal paints were made using slurries of these mineral powders whilst some insecticides were dispersed into a conventional acrylic paint binder. These formulations were then spray painted on neat and manure coated mud plaques. representative of the material typically used in rural mud houses. at twice the upper limit of the WHO recommended dosage range. DDT was applied directly onto mud plaques at four times the WHO recommended concentration and on manure plaques at twice WHO recommended concentration. All plaques were subjected to accelerated ageing conditions of 40°C and a relative humidity of 90%. The pyrethroids insecticides outperformed the carbamates and DDT in the accelerated ageing tests.

This solution is a general one also covering the diffusion within the two limiting cases usually considered in solutions to the Fick equation. viz. a perfect sink at the surface and a perfectly reflecting surface plane at the surface. An analysis of the solutions for these two cases shows that at small diffusion times the main effect of annealing is a nearly symmetric broadening of the implanted profile.

1053371,Ion bombardment of glassy carbon,2018,Johan B Malherbe and OS Odutemowo and EG Njoroge and DF Langa and TT Hlatshwayo and CC Theron,149,Vacuum,,19-22,Pergamon,Glassy carbon has applications in the storage of high level nuclear waste. Irradiation of glassy carbon are thus of importance to investigate. The paper reviews some aspects for ion bombardment. Glassy carbon is categorised as an amorphous material with graphitic crystallites. Glassy carbon has a much lower density than graphite. It has been proposed that glassy carbon must contain nanopores to account for this low density. Ion bombardment causes the destruction of these nanopores leading to densification of glassy carbon. The damage caused by ion bombardment at different temperatures has been investigated mostly by Raman spectroscopy and also by TEM. High fluence implantation of heavy elements into glassy carbon leads the amorphisation of the small graphitic crystallites in the implanted region. Raman spectroscopy showed that there is only slight recovery of damage at temperatures below 1000 °C …,True,PF1aTQoAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,12,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042207X17312472,460438577636357647,/scholar?cites=460438577636357647,,,0,0,0

These were proposed to explain the low density of GC. This paper explains the effect of ion bombardment (200 keV Sr+. 1 × 1016 Sr+/cm2 at RT) on the microstructure of GC. TEM and AFM show that micropores in pristine GC are destroyed leading to densification of GC from 1.42 g/cm3 to 2.03 g/cm3. The amorphisation of glassy carbon was also not complete with graphitic strands embedded within the GC. These were relatively few. as Raman analysis showed that the Sr implantation resulted in a typical amorphous Raman spectrum.

H2S can subsequently be converted to elemental sulphur via the commercially available chemical catalytic Claus process. This study investigated the carbonation of CaS by examining both the solution chemistry of the process and the properties of the formed carbonated product. CaS was successfully converted into CaCO3; however. the reaction yielded low-grade carbonate products (i.e. <90 mass% as CaCO3) which comprised a mixture of two CaCO3 polymorphs (calcite and vaterite). as well as trace minerals originating from the starting material.

Some of the most important stresses they are subjected to are their removal from the sow. their relocation to unfamiliar surroundings (often with new littermates) and a major change in their diet. These in turn may cause challenges to their digestive tract. weaning anorexia and suppressed immunity. which can all contribute to the post-weaning growth check commonly observed during this time. This growth check can greatly compromise the overall growing and finishing performance of the animal. in terms of reduced daily live-weight gain and increased days to slaughter. Marked changes in gut structure (eg villus atrophy. crypt hyperplasia) are typically observed within the first few days immediately following weaning. along with severely reduced digestive enzyme secretion and absorptive capacity of the small intestine (Miller et al.. 1986).Pre-weaned piglets benefit from a digestive tract which is well adapted to the digestion of fat-and lactose-rich sow milk (Partridge & Gill. 1993). Their digestive system however becomes profoundly challenged upon weaning when a milk-based diet is suddenly replaced by a dry diet of solid food containing complex carbohydrates. primarily starch. For instance. feeding piglets with a diet based on unprocessed wheat can induce a significant reduction in starch digestibility around four days post-weaning in both the mid (0.5) and distal (0.75) regions of the small intestine (Figure 1;(White et al.. 2006)).

1053481,Thinking a bow-and-arrow set: cognitive implications of Middle Stone Age bow and stone-tipped arrow technology,2012,Marlize Lombard and Miriam Noël Haidle,22,Cambridge Archaeological Journal,2,237,Cambridge University Press,For various reasons increased effort has recently been made to detect the early use of mechanically-projected weaponry in the archaeological record. but little effort has yet been made to investigate explicitly what these tool sets could indicate about human cognitive evolution. Based on recent evidence for the use of bow-and-arrow technology during the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa by 64 kya. we use the method of generating and analysing cognigrams and effective chains to explore thought-and-action sequences associated with this technology. We show that. when isolated. neither the production of a simple bow. nor that of a stone-tipped arrow. can be reasonably interpreted to indicate tool behaviour that is cognitively more complex than the composite artefacts produced by Neanderthals or archaic modern Homo. On the other hand. as soon as a bow-and-arrow set is used as an effective group of tools. a novel cognitive development is expressed in technological symbiosis. ie the ability to conceptualize a set of separate. yet inter-dependent tools.

1053482,Direct evidence for the use of ochre in the hafting technology of Middle Stone Age tools from Sibudu Cave,2006,Marlize Lombard,18,Southern African Humanities,1,57-67,Sabinet,Microscopy was performed on tools obtained from the Middle Stone Age deposits of Sibudu Cave because previous observations suggested that there might be a possible functional role for ochre at the site. Analyses of the distribution patterns of ochre residues conducted on post-Howiesons Poort points and Howiesons Poort segments from Sibudu Cave show that ochre was an integral part of the hafting technologies for the duration of these techno-complexes. Close associations between ochre and resin on these tools strengthen the hypothesis that ground ochre was probably mixed into the adhesives that were used to glue the tools to hafts. The evidence presented here expands our understanding of the versatility and value of pigmentatious material in prehistory; it is not intended to be an alternative or replacement hypothesis for its possible symbolic role.,True,W0G5vXwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,135,https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.10520/EJC84771,8044434409722327104,/scholar?cites=8044434409722327104,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31938624/Lombard_2006_SAHb_Ochre.pdf,0,0,0

South Africa,2004,Marlize Lombard,,The South African Archaeological Bulletin,,37-44,The South African Archaeological Society,The detailed analysis of microscopic residues on 24 lithic points from the post-Howiesons Poort Middle Stone Age layers in Sibudu Cave. KwaZulu-Natal. showed distinct distribution patterns of vegetal and faunal residues. Certain vegetal residues are concentrated on the proximal and medial portions of the tools whereas the less abundant faunal residues are concentrated on the distal portions. A method was developed to equalize the portions to prevent a skewed representation of the residues on different-sized portions. Chi-square tests were used to determine that the distribution patterns were statistically unlikely to be coincidental.

Farmers underwent radical shifts in social complexity that had a range of implications for change in the identity. status and viability of hunter-gatherers in the region. Based on a composite excavated and rock art sequence. we argue that rock shelters were places of social power. of which hunter-gatherers gradually lost control in the face of farmer appropriation. particularly in the second half of the 1st millennium AD. We argue that this appropriation stemmed. in part. from farmers appealing to the ambiguous power of 'first peoples' as a resource in the regulation of their own social needs.

Often. standard screening procedures are applied in a first step which results in conservative estimates. If through those screening procedures a potential exceedance of health-based guidance values is indicated. within the tiered approach more refined models are applied. However. the sources and types of uncertainties in deterministic and probabilistic models can vary or differ.A key objective of this work has been the mapping of different sources and types of uncertainties to better understand how to best use uncertainty analysis to generate more realistic comprehension of dietary exposure.

This paper investigates how and why a camel came to be painted in the remote rock art of the Makgabeng hills. Analysis of archival material allows one to attribute the painting to a Northern Sotho artist who was active in the first decade of the twentieth century. The purpose of the painting is revealed in its context; it forms part of a collection of paintings which ridicule elements of ineptness in the ways of the new white intruders. We argue that this pointed humour helped the Makgabeng community to overcome some of the trauma of the displacement and violence which characterized the era of the first white settlement in northern South Africa.,True,merBB48AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,36,https://www.jstor.org/stable/4100507,17545462674841492308,/scholar?cites=17545462674841492308,,,0,0,0

The art dates principally from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It has been known to researchers since the 1970s but has given up few of its secrets. I examine the questions of why the art was made and why the tradition ceased. Key to answering these is the realization that the art belonged to a specific historical and geographic context: the era and area where nyau was forced to become an underground movement because of its suppression by Ngoni invaders. missions. and the later colonial government.

We know that this is true for the very many images. from many traditions of image-making. of which we have good informed knowledge. One formal approach to pictures of which we do not have inside knowledge is to suppose that the naturalistic rule also holds there: by observing the traits of the picture. we should be able to figure out the traits of the subject it represents. How secure is this reasoning? What general rules of picture-making may there be which will be instructive?This chapter has come about because of a number of experiences which have challenged me. At a rockshelter on Mphunzi Hill in central Malawi I was contemplating the beauty of a depiction of a chameleon and marvelling at the powerful mixture of symbolic images that were juxtaposed at the site. Near the chameleon was a python and next to this a monitor lizard. all complex symbols in Chewa cosmology relating to the unified themes of rain. fertility and creation. My thoughts were interrupted by John (a locally born Malawian who was working with me) who asked:'Why do you say that thing is a chameleon? How do you know?'I was devastated. Drawing on knowledge of Chewa cosmology I was starting to see a link between the images and particular symbolic themes. This link demonstrated a connection between the art and Chewa female coming-of-age rituals. However. what was the use of this realisation if even John. a local. was not convinced that the shapes depicted the suggested subjects?

Archaeologists. irrespective of regional or methodological orientation. have recognized that ancient environments. landforms. geology. and soil science are pivotal in site reconstructions. The demand for this expertise has spawned a growing “how to” literature; several textbooks have been published since 2000. However. a glaring deficit in these volumes is the failure to treat anthropogenic sediments. specifically the components of the site deposit that are dominantly of cultural origin and/or modification.

Currently the diagnosis and monitoring of blood glucose and ketone bodies that are used in clinical studies involve the use of blood tests. This method entails pricking fingers for a drop of blood and placing a drop on a sensitive area of a strip which is pre-inserted into an electronic reading instrument. Furthermore. it is painful. invasive and expensive. and can be unsafe if proper handling is not undertaken. Human breath analysis offers a non-invasive and rapid method for detecting various volatile organic compounds thatare indicators for different diseases. In patients with diabetes mellitus. the body produces excess amounts of ketones such as acetoacetate. beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetone. Acetone is exhaled during respiration. The production of acetone is a result of the body metabolising fats instead of glucose to produce energy. There are various techniques that are used to analyse exhaled breath including Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS). Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR–MS). Selected Ion Flow Tube-Mass Spectrometry (SIFT–MS). laser photoacoustic spectrometry and so on. All these techniques are not portable. therefore this review places emphasis on how nanotechnology. through semiconductor sensing nanomaterials. has the potential to help individuals living with diabetes mellitus monitor their disease with cheap and portable devices.

The biological functionality of melanin depends on disorder which is considered as its essential part. This property distinguishes melanin from other much more intensively studied biomolecule systems such as nucleic acid. proteins and carbohydrates. Melanins have been reported to have a diverse number of functions in the biosystem. including photosensitization. metal ion chelation. photoprotection to absorb a broad range of electromagnetic radiation. antibiotic. thermoregulation. Melanins are found all over the body from the skin and blood to the nervous system but the role of melanin in all these system is unclear. FTIR spectroscopy technique is usually one of the most preferred techniques used to give a correct assignment of the observed spectral characteristic of functional groups corresponding to different absorption bands which are responsible of the absorption. FTIR is the characterization technique which is both rapid. non-destructive and requires small sized samples. In the material to be analysed. chemical bonds vibrate at a characteristic frequency representative of their structure. bond angle and length. FTIR spectrometer is important for the interpretation of the structure. binding capacity. affinity and sites of metal ions in melanin. These are important factors for better understanding the metals melanin complexity and its consequences.

Some of the most efficient sensitizers are synthetic dyes including transition metal coordination compounds such as Ruthenium polypyridyl complexes because of their highly efficient metal-to-ligand charge transfer. suitable ground and excited state energy levels with respect to titanium dioxide conduction band energy. They also have intense and wide range absorption in whole visible range. Even if they present such attractive features. their synthesis process is costly and complicated and they are not environment friendly because they contain heavy rare metals which are undesirable from the point of view of environmental conservation aspects.

Residues adhering to the stone tool with varying frequencies are interpreted as being the result of an intentional contact with the worked material during use. Yet. other processes during the life cycle of a stone tool or after deposition may leave residues and these residues may potentially lead to misinterpretations. We present a blind test that was designed to examine this issue. Results confirm that production. retouch. prehension. hafting. various incidental contacts during use and deposition may lead to residue depositions that significantly affect the accurateness of identifications of tool-use. All currently applied residue approaches are concerned. We therefore argue for a closer interaction with independent wear studies and a step-wise procedure in which a low magnification of wear traces is used as a first step for selecting potentially used flakes in archaeological contexts.

Sometimes traces of use are preserved and indicate use along the external platform edge prior to detachment. Unlike complete tools. which may have been curated and used elsewhere. use-flakes and retouch-flakes potentially provide stronger evidence that the activities identified by use-wear traces on the lithic artefacts took place at the site where the flakes were recovered.

Siberia,2018,Luc Bordes and Richard Fullagar and Linda C Prinsloo and Elspeth Hayes and Maxim B Kozlikin and Michael V Shunkov and Anatoly P Derevianko and Richard G Roberts,95,Journal of Archaeological Science,,52-63,Academic Press,Raman spectroscopy is a powerful method for detecting micro-residues on stone tools. To further develop techniques for determining stone tool function. we devised a methodology using Raman microscopy to analyse in situ micro-residues before conventional usewear study. We analysed 18 stone artefacts collected in situ from Denisova Cave in Siberia. where excellent organic residue preservation is expected. We report here details of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids identified on eight stone tools from the Middle Palaeolithic levels. The spatial distribution of smeared fatty acids shows strong correlation with spatial distributions of usewear (particularly use-polish. but also striations. edge rounding and scarring) on each tool. demonstrating that these micro-residues are likely associated with prehistoric tool contact with animal tissue.

The most common approach for residue analysis is through the use of optical microscopes. which can be used to visually identify in situ residues directly from the tool surface (with reflected light microscopes. RLM). as well as in water extractions sampled from the utilised tool edges (with transmitted light microscopes. TLM). Recently. the scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) has shown great potential for archaeological residue analysis as it can provide high-resolution images at very high magnifications as well as elemental analysis of adhering material. An advantage of this instrument is that it is capable of operating in low vacuum or “environmental” mode. allowing …,True,REslxHoAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18305236,17468302897231296835,/scholar?cites=17468302897231296835,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elspeth_Hayes2/publication/328812010_Integrating_SEM-EDS_in_a_sequential_residue_analysis_protocol_Benefits_and_challenges/links/5fd1a828a6fdcc697bf2a98d/Integrating-SEM-EDS-in-a-sequential-residue-analysis-protocol-Benefits-and-challenges.pdf,0,0,0

1053757,Quandong stones: A specialised Australian nut-cracking tool,2019,Colin Pardoe and Richard Fullagar and Elspeth Hayes,14,PloS one,10,e0222680,Public Library of Science,The quandong or native peach (Santalum acuminatum R.Br.) has been recognised as an important and tasty food resource among Aboriginal Australians in arid and semi-arid areas of southern Australia. It is valued for its fruit that is consumed raw or dried. and for its kernel. which is eaten raw or ground into paste for medicinal and skin care purposes. This paper reports on a study of ground stone implements within the Murray Darling Basin that has identified quandong stones as a distinct type of implement made specifically for the efficient cracking of quandong nuts. Data are presented on 1.327 ground stone implements from collections in 12 different locations in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). an area almost completely devoid of stone sources. Given the paucity of stone. multi-purpose use of implements is widely documented. Although it was common to find pits present in mortars and other ground stone tools demonstrating multiple functions. including use as anvils. a class of single purpose stones with multiple pits and distinctive form was identified. Most of these were found in areas known for groves of quandong and four were analysed for use-wear and residues along with two other ground stone items from the MDB. The results support their identification as specialised anvil stones for cracking quandong nuts.,True,REslxHoAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,5,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222680,4361252561081800818,/scholar?cites=4361252561081800818,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222680,0,0,0

Less common are ground stones modified for non-utilitarian. symbolic purposes; for example. polished and carved stone ornaments; ritual implements such as cylcons and tjuringa sacred stones; and unused. well-crafted ground-stone axes. In this paper. we report on the function and potential significance of an unusual ground stone artefact from a site near Bannockburn. southwestern Australia. A set of regularly spaced. shallow grooves has been cut into the surface of each side of the stone. Use-wear. residues and experimental replica tools indicate that the grooves were probably made with a stone flake and then used to shape or sharpen wooden implements such as spear points or the edges of boomerangs or other weapons. The microscopic wear outside the grooves indicates contact with soft wood or other plant material. possibly a soft plant fibre bag. We suggest that the Bannockburn artefact primarily functioned as a woodworking tool. but the even spacing of the incisions suggests that they were intentionally placed. perhaps to convey a special meaning. perhaps as a tally system or other form of communication.,True,REslxHoAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,2,http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lithicstudies/article/view/3088,14750900433211267365,/scholar?cites=14750900433211267365,,http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lithicstudies/article/download/3088/6891,0,0,0
