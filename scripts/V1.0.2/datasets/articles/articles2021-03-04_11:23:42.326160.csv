1118410,Neural message passing for quantum chemistry,2017,Justin Gilmer and Samuel S Schoenholz and Patrick F Riley and Oriol Vinyals and George E Dahl,,,,1263-1272,PMLR,Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in chemistry. drug discovery. and materials science. Luckily. several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point. the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper. we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.,True,Q7H4FhYAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,1809,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/gilmer17a.html,6135306581977403485,/scholar?cites=6135306581977403485,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/gilmer17a/gilmer17a.pdf,0,0,0
1118411,Molecular graph convolutions: moving beyond fingerprints,2016,Steven Kearnes and Kevin McCloskey and Marc Berndl and Vijay Pande and Patrick Riley,30,Journal of computer-aided molecular design,8,595-608,Springer International Publishing,Molecular “fingerprints” encoding structural information are the workhorse of cheminformatics and machine learning in drug discovery applications. However. fingerprint representations necessarily emphasize particular aspects of the molecular structure while ignoring others. rather than allowing the model to make data-driven decisions. We describe molecular graph convolutions. a machine learning architecture for learning from undirected graphs. specifically small molecules. Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph—atoms. bonds. distances. etc.—which allows the model to take greater advantage of information in the graph structure. Although graph convolutions do not outperform all fingerprint-based methods. they (along with other graph-based methods) represent a new paradigm in ligand-based virtual screening with exciting opportunities for future improvement.,True,Q7H4FhYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,706,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-016-9938-8,952143994290375917,/scholar?cites=952143994290375917,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5028207/,0,0,0

To train these architectures at scale. we gather large amounts of data from public sources to create a dataset of nearly 40 million measurements across more than 200 biological targets. We investigate several aspects of the multitask framework by performing a series of empirical studies and obtain some interesting results:(1) massively multitask networks obtain predictive accuracies significantly better than single-task methods.(2) the predictive power of multitask networks improves as additional tasks and data are added.(3) the total amount of data and the total number of tasks both contribute significantly to multitask improvement. and (4) multitask networks afford limited transferability to tasks not in the training set.

1118421,On behavior classification in adversarial environments,2000,Patrick Riley and Manuela Veloso,,,,371-380,Springer. Tokyo,In order for robotic systems to be successful in domains with other agents possibly interfering with the accomplishing of goals. the agents must be able to adapt to the opponents’ behavior. The more quickly the agents can respond to a new situation. the better they will perform. We present an approach to doing adaptation which relies on classification of the current adversary into predefined adversary classes.

1118422,Defining and using ideal teammate and opponent agent models: A case study in robotic soccer,2000,Peter Stone and Patrick Riley and Manuela Veloso,,,,441-442,IEEE,A common challenge for agents in multiagent systems is trying to predict what other agents are going to do in the future. Such knowledge can help an agent determine which of its current action options are most likely to help it achieve its goals. Ideally. an agent could learn a model of other agents' behavior patterns via direct observation of their past actions. However. that is only possible when agents have many repeated interactions with one another. We explore the use of agent models in an application where extensive interactions with a particular agent are not possible. namely robotic soccer. In robotic soccer tournaments. such as RoboCup (Kitano et al.. 1997). a team of agents plays against another team for a single. short (typically 10-minute) period. The opponents' behaviors are usually not observable prior to this game and there are not enough interactions during the game to build a useful model.

1118423,Planning for Distributed Execution through Use of Probabilistic Opponent Models.,2002,Patrick Riley and Manuela M Veloso,,,,72-82,,In multiagent domains with adversarial and cooperative team agents. team agents should be adaptive to the current environment and opponent. We introduce an online method to provide the agents with team plans that a “coach” agent generates in response to the specific opponents. The coach agent can observe the agents’ behaviors but it has only periodic communication with the rest of the team. The coach uses a Simple Temporal Network (Dechter. Meiri. & Pearl 1991) to represent team plans as coordinated movements among the multiple agents and the coach searches for an opponent-dependent plan for its teammates. This plan is then communicated to the agents. who execute the plan in a distributed fashion. using information from the plan to maintain consistency among the team members. In order for these plans to be effective and adaptive. models of opponent movement are used in the planning. The coach is then able to quickly select between different models online by using a Bayesian style update on a probability distribution over the models. Planning then uses the model which is found to be the most likely. The system is fully implemented in a simulated robotic soccer environment. In several recent games with completely unknown adversarial teams. the approach demonstrated a visible adaptation to the different teams.,True,Q7H4FhYAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,79,https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AIPS/2002/AIPS02-008.pdf,10163213420742396578,/scholar?cites=10163213420742396578,,https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AIPS/2002/AIPS02-008.pdf,0,0,0

An example of such a challenge is optimising the performance of plasma fusion experiments. The highly-nonlinear and temporally-varying interaction between the plasma. its environment and external controls presents a considerable complexity in these experiments. A further difficulty arises from the fact that there is no single objective metric that fully captures both plasma quality and equipment constraints. To efficiently optimise the system. we develop the Optometrist Algorithm. a stochastic perturbation method combined with human choice. Analogous to getting an eyeglass prescription. the Optometrist Algorithm confronts a human operator with two alternative experimental settings and associated outcomes. A human operator then chooses which experiment produces subjectively better results.

The combination of the very selective triple quadrupole based tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) scans with the very sensitive ion trap product ion scans allows rapid identification of peptides at low concentrations derived from post‐translationally modified proteins on chromatographic time scales. The Q TRAP instrument also offers the opportunity to conduct a variety of ion processing steps prior to performing a mass scan. For example. the enhancement of the multiple‐charge ion contents of the ion trap can be performed resulting in a survey mass spectrum dominated by double‐ and triple‐charge peptides.

At 2% (w/w). pectin. alginic acid (>50% reduction) and xanthan gum (∼20%) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced acrylamide formation in chemical models. In the fried snack model. effective inhibition of acrylamide formation (∼30%) by most of the hydrocolloids was observed only when the concentration was increased to 5%. Immersing potato strips for 1 h in a 1% alginic acid solution before frying produced inhibition of acrylamide formation similar to that in a 5% solution. and immersing for 5 h led to a significantly lower AA content (∼60% versus ∼30% reduction) compared with immersing for 1 h in a 1% or 5% immersion solution.

M+·. with well-defined initial location of the radical site were explored using collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Peptide radical cations were produced by gas-phase fragmentation of CoIII(salen)-peptide complexes [salen=N.N′-ethylenebis (salicylideneiminato)]. Subsequent hydrogen abstraction from the β-carbon of the side-chain followed by Cα-Cβ bond cleavage results in the loss of a neutral side chain and formation of an α-radical cation with the radical site localized on the α-carbon of the backbone. Similar CID spectra dominated by radical-driven dissociation products were obtained for a number of arginine-containing α-radicals. suggesting that for these systems radical migration precedes fragmentation.

Parallel descriptions have been developed for a binuclear thiolate-bridged MV reference model complex ([(LiPrdacoSCu) 2]+) and a homovalent (II. II) analogue ([LiPr2tacnSCu) 2] 2+. where LiPrdacoS and LiPr2tacnS are macrocyclic ligands with attached thiolates that bridge the Cu ions. Previous studies have qualitatively defined the ground-state wave function of CuA in terms of ligand field effects on the orbital orientation and the presence of a metal-metal bond. The studies presented here provide further evidence for a direct Cu-Cu interaction and. importantly. experimentally quantify the covalency of the ground-state wave function. The experimental results are further supported by DFT calculations. The nature of the ground-state wave function of CuA is compared to that of the well-defined blue copper site in plastocyanin. and the importance of this wave function to the lower reorganization energy and ET function of CuA is discussed. This wave function incorporates anisotropic covalency into the intra-and intermolecular ET pathways in cytochrome c oxidase. Thus. the high covalency of the Cys-Cu bond allows a path through this ligand to become competitive with a shorter His path in the intramolecular ET from CuA to heme a and is particularly important for activating the …,True,u92_JEMAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC,107,http://chemgroups.ucdavis.edu/~cramer/Publications_pdf/cramer_123.pdf,2409905981867883202,/scholar?cites=2409905981867883202,,http://chemgroups.ucdavis.edu/~cramer/Publications_pdf/cramer_123.pdf,0,0,0

The k cat of the Fe(III)Ni(II) derivative (approximately 60 s−1) is approximately 20% of that of native uteroferrin. and the Ni(II) uptake is considerably faster than the reconstitution of full enzymatic activity. suggesting a slow conformational change is required to attain optimal reactivity. An analysis of the pH dependence of the catalytic properties of Fe(III)Ni(II) uteroferrin indicates that the μ-hydroxide is the likely nucleophile. Thus. the Ni(II) derivative employs a mechanism similar to that proposed for …,True,u92_JEMAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,53,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00775-007-0305-z,14597972624742206640,/scholar?cites=14597972624742206640,,http://eprints.nuim.ie/3693/1/GS_Probing.pdf,0,0,0

The water uptake and acid doping of PBI membranes have been studied. The water uptake of PBI from the vapour phase is only slightly increased as the atmospheric humidity increases up to unity (100%). Little difference is observed for the water uptake from vapour and liquid phases. behaving very differently from Nafion membranes. When doped with phosphoric acid at low levels (<2). the active sites of the imidazole ring are preferably occupied by the doping acid and the water uptake is consequently lower. At higher acid doping levels. the water uptake is influenced by the excess of hygroscopic acid and higher water uptake than for Nafion membranes is observed.

1118586,Tailoring properties of biocompatible PEG-DMA hydrogels with UV light,2012,B Sania,2012,,,,Scientific Research Publishing,Hydrogels are highly water-absorbent hydrophilic polymer networks. which show potential in many biocompatible applications. In previous work. we demonstrated the feasibility of using poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEG-DMA) gels polymerized with a photoinitiator for encapsulation and stabilization of painted biomimetic membrane arrays for novel separation technologies or biosensor applications. These gels were formed from PEG-DMA monomers suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and gelated by radical polymerization in the presence of the photoinitiator Darocur 1173. In this work. we show that the properties of a PEG-DMA hydrogel formed by photoinitiated polymerizetion can be tailored by varying the photocrosslinking time. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy (RS) showed that the optimal crosslinking time for the gel was 6 - 10 minutes and that the water content of the gels could be tuned in the range of 50 - 90 wt%.

The apparently quite strongdriving force toward pairwise association of metallotetraphenylporphyrin rr-cationradical species is further demonstrated in these studies. Dimer formation has significant effects on the molecular structure. leading to an unusual saddle-shaped core conformation. Solid-state dimer formation also leads to antiferromagnetic coupling between the ring radicals and the extent of the coupling appears tobe quite sensitive to the extent of porphyrin core overlap. Since spin coupling is insufficient to producediamagnetism at room temperature. the present work supports the partitioningof intra-and intermolecular spin coupling effects previously made in iron (III) and copper (II) porphyrin radicals. 3· 4Acknowledgment.

This approach sidesteps the production of high-pressure gases inside the electrolytic cell (a major cause of membrane degradation) and essentially eliminates the hazardous issue of product gas crossover at the low current densities that characterize renewables-driven water-splitting devices.

It is made on an industrial scale via the Haber Bosch process. which requires significant infrastructure to be in place such that ammonia is generally made in large. centralized facilities. If ammonia could be produced under less demanding conditions. then there would be the potential for smaller devices to be used to generate ammonia in a decentralized manner for local consumption. Electrochemistry has been proposed as an enabling technology for this purpose as it is relatively simple to scale electrolytic devices to meet almost any level of demand.

1118608,First row transition metal catalysts for solar-driven water oxidation produced by electrodeposition,2016,Isolda Roger and Mark D Symes,4,,18,6724-6741,Royal Society of Chemistry,As our reliance on renewable energy resources increases. so will our need to store this energy in the form of chemical fuels to iron-out peaks and troughs in supply. Sunlight. the most plentiful source of renewable energy. is especially problematic in this regard as it is so diffuse. One way to convert solar irradiation to fuels effectively would be to develop large surface area photo-electrochemical devices that could use sunlight directly to split water into H2 and O2. However. in order to be feasible. such an approach requires that these devices (and their components) are extremely cheap. In this review. we will discuss catalysts for the water oxidation half-reaction of electrochemical water splitting that can be produced by electrodeposition (a technique well suited to large-scale. low-cost applications). and that are based on the comparatively plentiful and inexpensive first row transition metals.

However. in traditional PECs. the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction are coupled. and so the rate of both of these is limited by the photocurrents that can be generated from the solar flux. This in turn leads to slow rates of gas evolution that favor crossover of H2 into the O2 stream and vice versa. even through ostensibly impermeable membranes such as Nafion. Herein. we show that the use of the electron-coupled-proton buffer (ECPB) H3PMo12O40 allows solar-driven O2 evolution from water to proceed at rates of over 1 mA cm–2 on WO3 photoanodes without the need for any additional electrochemical bias. No H2 is produced in the PEC. and instead H3PMo12O40 is reduced to H5PMo12O40.

Although a range of cyanobacteria and algae have been shown to generate photocurrent in devices of a multitude of architectures. mechanistic understanding of extracellular electron transfer by phototrophs remains minimal. Here we describe a mediatorless bioelectrochemical device to measure the electrogenic output of a planktonically grown cyanobacterium. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Light dependent production of current is measured. and its magnitude is shown to scale with microbial cell concentration and light intensity. Bioelectrochemical characterization of a Synechocystis mutant lacking Photosystem II demonstrates conclusively that production of the majority of photocurrent requires a functional water splitting aparatus and electrons are likely ultimately derived from water.

However. current synthetic methods of Au nanostars have limited control over their symmetry; most existing nanostars are characterized by having uncertain number of arms with different lengths and random spatial arrangement.

In this work. we report an experimental study where the wettability properties of silica nanoparticles are modified by the adsorption of alkyltrimethylammonium surfactants (CnTAB. n = 12. 16) on the surface of the particles. We have pointed out that the wettability of the complexes is controlled by an intricate balance of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the particle surface and the surfactant.

The importance can be mainly associated with the rich phase behavior of these mixtures that confers a wide range of physico-chemical properties to the complexes formed by polymers and surfactants. both in bulk and at the interfaces. This latter aspect is especially relevant because of the use of their mixture for the stabilization of dispersed systems such as foams and emulsions. with an increasing interest in several fields such as cosmetic. food science or fabrication of controlled drug delivery structures.

1118651,Contact angle of micro-and nanoparticles at fluid interfaces,2014,Armando Maestro and Eduardo Guzmán and Francisco Ortega and Ramón G Rubio,19,,4,355-367,Elsevier,The contact angle of particles attached to fluid interfaces plays a key role in many scientific and technological aspects of particle-laden layers. In spite of the recognized importance. the laws that govern this property are still poorly understood. The main problem associated with the study of this property is that multiple variables are involved in the wetting process of particles by fluid interfaces. Such variables are associated with the chemical nature of both the particles and the fluid phases. and with the particle’s size. Understanding of the different aspects controlling the contact angle of particles is a physico-chemical challenge. and is very important because of the many technological aspects in which particle laden interfaces are involved.

Conclusions We have foundthat the effect of laser-induced dissociation of highly excited vibrational states of triatomic molecules depends on the nature of classical dynamics of the state. In the case where the excited state is a short-lived complex. the laser has very little effect on the dissociation dynamics or lifetime. However. if the molecule is in a state which exhibits mostly quasibound motion. the presence of a laser can enhance the dissociationprobabilities and rates. Not surprisingly. such enhancement increases with laser intensity. and for each intensity there is a resonant driving frequency at which the maximum enhancement occurs. A possible experimental way to probe for such states would be to investigate which preparedstates can have their lifetimes significantly altered. Systems which exhibit non-RRKM behavior would be good candidates for demonstrating such effects.Acknowledgment.

These so defined planes have a dihedral angle of only 3-4. This molecule therefore does not undergo nonclassical distortions. as does its triple-bonded relative. F3S= CCF3. 39The electron deformation density of F4S= C (CH3) CF3exhibits detailed features of the bonding. especially if the oriented atom model (OAM) is used for the promolecule. The difficulty of this method. if applied to atoms with a higher valence state. is that no trivial oriented reference density can be established. as is the case for atoms of low valence state. It must be realized that the preconception used in the interpretation of charge redistribution will influence the results. 33,True,Jb2QI54AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,60,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00001a034,4664822397065008735,/scholar?cites=4664822397065008735,,,0,0,0

For this purpose we performed multiple oxidations using two chlorate methods (Staudenmaier and Hofmann) and a permanganate method (Hummers).

When exfoliated. the materials’ band gap increases and changes from an indirect band gap to a direct one. During the exfoliation. the TMDs may undergo a phase transition from 2H to 1T polymorph. which is likely electronically driven and accompanied by a metal–insulator transition. A significantly higher efficiency of the exfoliation was observed using sodium naphthalenide compared to butyllithium. Moreover we demonstrate that the exfoliation has a dramatic influence on the magnetic properties of two TMDs. MoS2 and WS2.

Departing from the traditional scheme of reviewing the species and compounds of a particular element. this volume has been prepared as a state-of-the-art report on the chemical thermodynamics of aqueous-solid solution systems in the context of radioactive waste management. and more specifically oriented towards underground disposal. With a few exceptions. systems involving solid solutions have not been the subject of review in the preceding volumes of the series. started in the 1990s. Two factors justify the present interest in solid solutions within the NEA Chemical Thermodynamics Database (TDB) Project. First. in recent years. a significant number of species and stoichiometric compounds of several elements have been added (or updated) to the critically reviewed database. Second. powerful experimental techniques enabling the microscopic characterisation of systems are currently of widespread use. and advanced computational tools for both forward and inverse modelling of aqueoussolid solution equilibria have been developed. For this reason. the Management Board of the NEA TDB III Project decided to set up an Expert Team to prepare a state-of-theart report that could constitute the basis for a more systematic effort in evaluating the thermodynamic properties of solid solutions as applicable to radioactive waste management. It is hoped that the present volume. resulting from the Expert Team’s efforts. will contribute to the dissemination of the underlying thermodynamic formalism needed for modelling aqueous …,True,iduttJgAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,72,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=283671459372735417&hl=en&oi=scholarr,283671459372735417,/scholar?cites=283671459372735417,,,0,0,0

At pH 8.0. flat radial uranium and calcium zoned precipitates form at the mineral-solution interface. At pH 4.3. uranium forms an anastomosing precipitate throughout the calcite surface. RBS analyses confirmed the SEM analyses showing that uranium forms a solid phase within the calcite surface. but formation of an uranium-calcium solid solution at depth is limited. In sharp contrast to U(VI). Nd is concentrated in the solid phase as individual neodymium-calcium carbonate crystals. Calcite and pure orthorhombic neodymium carbonate crystals dissolve at the expense of the formation of a more stable neodymium-calcium solid solution. In the presence of calcite. a thorium-calcium solid solution forms by exchanging Th for Ca in the calcite structure.

1118718,Time evolution of dissolved oxygen and redox conditions in a HLW repository,1994,Paul Wersin and Kastriot Spahiu and Jordi Bruno,,,SKB-TR--94-02,,Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co.,The evolution of oxygen in a HLW repository has been studied using presently available geochemical background information. The important processes affecting oxygen migration in the near-field include diffusion and oxidation of pyrite and dissolved Fe (II). The evaluation of time scales of oxygen decrease is carried out with (1) an analytical approach involving the coupling of diffusion and chemical reaction.(2) a numerical geochemical approach involving the application of a newly developped diffusion-extended version of the STEADYQL code.Both approaches yield consistent rates of oxygen decrease and indicate that oxidation of pyrite impurities in the clay is the dominant process. The results obtained from geochemical modelling are interpreted in terms of evolution of redox conditions. Moreover. a sensitivity analysis of the major geochemical and physical parametres is performed. These results indicate that the uncertainties associated with reactive pyrite surface area impose the overall uncertainties of prediction of time scales. Thus. the obtained time of decrease to 1% of inital O2 concentrations range between 7 and 290 years. The elapsed time at which the transition to anoxic conditions occurs is estimated to be within the same time range.

By variations of the duty cycle (ton/(ton + toff)) employed during the plasma treatment. it has been possible to achieve a high retention of the anhydride groups within the film. Hydration of the anhydride groups in water created a carboxylic acid functionalized film. which was used to support a negatively charged DMPG lipid bilayer using Ca2+ as a chelating agent. The capacitance and resistance of adsorbed DMPG on three films prepared at different plasma duty cycles could be correlated with the relative amount of anhydride groups present in the plasma polymer films. ,True,JFwSPV0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,101,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la991649o,8685645140965344417,/scholar?cites=8685645140965344417,,,0,0,0

It has been reported that the antibacterial and cytotoxic properties of silver are affected by the assay conditions. particularly the type of growth media used in vitro. The toxicity of Ag+ to bacterial cells is comparable to that of human cells. We demonstrate that biologically relevant compounds such as glutathione. cysteine and human blood components significantly reduce the toxicity of silver ions to clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria and primary human dermal fibroblasts (skin cells). Bacteria are able to grow normally in the presence of silver nitrate at >20-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) if Ag+ and thiols are added in a 1∶1 ratio because the reaction of Ag+ with extracellular thiols prevents silver ions from interacting with cells. Extracellular thiols and human serum also significantly reduce the antimicrobial activity of silver wound dressings Aquacel-Ag (Convatec) and Acticoat (Smith & Nephew) to Staphylococcus aureus. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli in vitro. These results have important implications for the deployment of silver as an antimicrobial agent in environments exposed to biological tissue or secretions.

Novel strategies are in big demand to facilitate the structure determination process that will ultimately hasten the day when sequence information alone can provide a three-dimensional model. Cell-free or in vitro expression enables rapid access to large quantities of high-quality membrane proteins suitable for an array of applications. Despite its impressive efficiency. to date only two membrane proteins produced by the in vitro approach have yielded crystal structures. Here. we have analysed synergies of cell-free expression and crystallisation in lipid mesophases for generating an X-ray structure of the integral membrane enzyme diacylglycerol kinase to 2.28-Å resolution.

When the blood pressure is first raised by angiotonin or by other pressor agents. the subsequent response to hexamethonium is much reduced. Similar responses are observed in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. This is due to the reaction of the regulating centers which compensate for the effect of the pressor agent by reducing the neurogenic component. The resulting decrease in the neurogenically maintained fraction of the blood pressure diminishes the response to hexamethonium.

The diastolic pressure was taken at the moment when the arterial sound becomes muffled. usually 5 mm. higher than that at which the sound disappeared. The blood pressure was measured on the left arm with the subject sitting in a quiet. warm room. All subjects were instructed to find a comfortable posture. and then to remain still and with the mind blank throughout the half-hour or longer period during which the measurements were made. No conversation was allowed. The observer avoided unnecessary movement. and as a rule no third person entered the room during this time.

As regards selectivity of action. their doses which produce hypotension are smaller than those required to affect gastric secretion. Kay and Smith (1950) have shown that the paralysis of vagal ganglia by hexamethonium in hypotensive dosage inhibits the volume and acidity of gastric secretion in hyperchlorhydric patients. Gastric motility is difficult to study. because the concomitant severe hypotension often causes nausea and vomiting. but it is improbable that inhibition of gastric motility can be produced by ganglion-blocking agents in the absence of an action on gastric secretion.Preliminary observations suggest that constipation is less during continuous oral treatment with these drugs than with hexamethonium. indicating a smaller risk of paralytic ileus.

Our synthetic strategy directly links the known CA pharmacophore (ArSO2NH2) to a sugar “tail” moiety through a rigid 1.2.3-triazole linker unit using the Cu(I)-catalyzed 1.3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction or “click chemistry”. Many of the glycoconjugates were potent CA inhibitors and exhibited some isozyme selectivity. In particular. the methyl-d-glucuronate triazoles 6 and 14 were potent inhibitors of hCA IX (Kis 9.9 and 8.4 nM. respectively) with selectivity also favoring this isozyme.

Plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) differs from FRET because of the lack of a Stoke's shift. non-local absorption effects and a strong dependence on the plasmon's dephasing rate and dipole moment. PIRET non-radiatively transfers energy through an insulating spacer layer. which prevents interfacial charge recombination losses and dephasing of the plasmon from hot-electron transfer. The distance dependence of dipole–dipole coupling is mapped out for a range of detuning across the plasmon resonance.

Addition of rhodamine6G gives rise to SERS signals characteristic of this dye. which are diagnostic of the hybridization event.

Members of the PGT121 family of antibodies. isolated from an African donor. neutralize ∼70% of circulating isolates with a median IC50 less than 0.05 µg ml−1. Here. we show that three family members. PGT121. PGT122 and PGT123. have very similar crystal structures.

As a first step toward developing such an immunogen. we investigated whether the 20-residue A-helix of the HA2 chain that forms the major component of the epitope of broadly neutralizing antibodies CR6261.

Many viruses encode scaffolding proteins to shift the equilibrium toward particle formation by promoting intersubunit interactions and stabilizing assembly intermediates. Bacteriophage HK97 lacks an explicit scaffolding protein. but the capsid protein (gp5) contains a scaffold-like N-terminal segment termed the delta domain. When gp5 is expressed in Escherichia coli. the delta domain guides 420 copies of the subunit into a procapsid with T = 7 laevo icosahedral symmetry named Prohead-I. Prohead-I can be disassembled and reassembled under mild conditions and it cannot mature further.

Individual shape-resonance levels are excited with laser radiation from high rotational levels of the X Σ+ 1 ground state of C H+.

The metal tris-bipyridine complex offers four different templates on which three helices may be arranged to form a bundle structure. Analysis of one of such proteins by HPLC.

Therefore. this artificial protein does not have a single well defined tertiary structure. but. instead. exists as an ensemble of at least four closely related structures. Mutant peptides with diversified interior residues did not form a stable three-α-helix bundle protein. Packing interactions of interior hydrophobic residues must be optimized to construct artificial proteins with a well defined tertiary structure.

An extensive solvent screen has revealed that hindered aliphatic ethers. such as MTBE. are optimum for this reaction at ambient temperature. Many TPOs undergo considerable reduction at ambient temperature and then stall due to inhibition. 31P and 13C NMR studies using isotopically labeled substrates as well as competition studies have revealed that the source of this inhibition is tetraisobutyldialuminoxane (TIBAO). which builds up as the reaction proceeds.

The isotherms. obtained by frontal analysis. show an S-shape and the corresponding Scatchard plots indicate positive cooperativity. The slopes and intercepts of the Scatchard plots at low solute concentration are analyzed in terms of two species —a protomer and a higher order stronger adsorbing species. An explicit equation of the isotherm is developed based on this model. and this expression is shown to reproduce the isotherm shape using the appropriate derived parameters. It is further shown from this equation that a Langmuir-shaped adsorption isotherm can be obtained if the higher order associate or aggregate binds weaker to the support than the protomer.

In particular. most of these polymers (including polypyrrole. polyaniline. polythiophene) and their derivatives can be used as the sensitive layer of conductimetric gas sensors because of their conducting properties. An important advantage of polymer-based gas sensors is their efficiency at room temperature. This characteristic is interesting since most of the commercially-available sensors. usually based on metal oxides. work at high temperatures (300–400 C). Consequently. polymer-based gas sensors are playing a growing role in the improvement of public health and environment control because they can lead to gas sensors operating with rapid detection. high sensitivity. small size. and specificity in atmospheric conditions. In this review. the recent advances in electrodeposited polymer-based gas sensors are summarized and discussed.

Photochem.,,1,,The development of photochemical reaction dynamics has been extremely rapid over the last decade (l-7). The impetus behind this growth has been the availability of new technology that has given the photochemist highly sensitive tools that can be used to probe the unstable fragments of the photochemical process. Certainly. the laser is foremost among the new tools in the photochemical arsenal. With tunable lasers. photochemists can probe the quantum state distribution of photochemical fragments. Lasers can also be used to dissociate a molecule. often from a given rovibronic level of the excited state. Their high intensity is useful in producing enough fragments so that less sensitive analytical techniques may be used for detection and characterization of the photochemical process. The polarization characteristics of lasers allow the photochemist to gain new information about the lifetime of the excited state and the absorption transition moment in the dissociation process.

Some of the other radicals such as CN and NH2 can also be explained by the photodissociation of stable compounds such as HCN. CH3CN and NH3. Other radicals such as NH. C2. and C3 do not appear to originate from the direct photolysis of any stable parent compound. The photolysis of free radicals that are formed as primary products in the photolysis of stable parent molecules has been suggested as an alternate source for these radicals. It is shown that such a process would be consistent with the currently available laboratory data and with cometary observations.,True,jqVV1ZEAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,53,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0047267076850149,3788057033702559155,/scholar?cites=3788057033702559155,,,0,0,0

The two primary processes that have been identified from these measurements are the H+C3H3 and the H2+C3H2 channels. The quantum yields for these first steps are 0.89 and 0.11. respectively. Subsequent photolysis of the C3H3 radical produces H2+C3H. C3H2+H. and C2H2+CH. while the C3H2 produces C3+H2. C2H+CH. and C2H2+C. The translational energy distributions for each one of these steps have been derived using the forward convolution technique.

Except for CH4 the vibrational energy of the CN radical has little or no effect on the observed rate constants. indicating that any barriers occur early in the reaction coordinate.

It is known that the local crystallography of the foil influences the graphene growth rate. Here we find an epitaxial relationship between graphene and copper foil. Interfacial restructuring between graphene and copper drives the formation of (n10) facets on what is otherwise a mostly Cu(100) surface. and the facets in turn influence the graphene orientations from the onset of growth.

Two schemes are compared: One involves an established two-step procedure where Pd2+ ions are first coordinated to the pyridine moieties and subsequently reduced in Pd2+-free electrolyte. The second deposition routine involves electroreduction in an electrolyte containing low concentration of Pd2+ which merges both steps and. thus. significantly simplifies metal deposition onto pyridine-terminated SAMs. Both strategies produce identical Pd nanoparticles (NPs) which exhibit a narrow size distribution and an apparent STM height of ∼2.4 nm.

To date. hydrogen tautomerism in unimolecular switches has been restricted to the central macrocycle of porphyrin-type molecules. The present work reveals how H-tautomerism is the mechanism for switching in substituted quinone derivatives. a novel class of molecules with a different chemical structure. We hence reveal that the previous restrictions applying to tautomeric molecular switches bound to a surface are not valid in general. The activation energy of switching in a prototypical quinone derivative is determined using inelastic electron tunneling.

Previous attempts have not detected any organic compounds in the Martian regolith. It is therefore critical to investigate the processes that may affect organic molecules on and below the planet's surface. Laboratory simulations can provide useful data about the reaction pathways of organic material at Mars' surface. We have studied the stability of amino acid thin films against ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and use those data to predict the survival time of these compounds on and in the Martian regolith. We show that thin films of glycine and D‐alanine are expected to have half‐lives of 22 ± 5 hr and of 3 ± 1 hr. respectively. when irradiated with Mars‐like UV flux levels. Modelling shows that the half‐lives of the amino acids are extended to the order of 107 years when …,True,cZqVWq8AAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC,133,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2005.tb00183.x,9304185281633549849,/scholar?cites=9304185281633549849,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2005.tb00183.x,0,0,0

We examined this apparent transformation of the soil N cycle using a series of ancient Atacama Desert soils (>2 My) that vary in rainfall (21 to <2 mm yr−1). With decreasing rainfall. soil organic C decreases to 0.3 kg C m−2 and biological activity becomes minimal. while soil NO3− and organic N increase to 4 kg N m−2 and 1.4 kg N m−2. respectively. Atmospheric NO3− (Δ17O = 23.0‰) increases from 39% to 80% of total soil NO3− as rainfall decreases.

Here we develop a selective sulphide-trapping strategy involving sulphide addition to an aldehyde; the resulting hemithioacetal undergoes a Michael addition with an adjacent unsaturated acrylate ester to form a thioacetal at neutral pH in aqueous solution. Employing this new strategy. two sulphide-selective fluorescent probes. SFP-1 and SFP-2. were synthesized on the basis of two different fluorophore templates. These probes exhibit an excellent fluorescence increase and an emission maximum shift (SFP-1) in response to Na 2 S and H 2 S in a high thiol background as found under physiological conditions.

This reaction advances the transition-metal coordination chemistry of ammonia beyond its role for more than a century as an ancillary ligand. The precursor for this insertion reaction is an iridium(I) olefin complex with an aliphatic ligand containing one carbon and two phosphorus donor atoms. Kinetic and isotopic labeling studies indicate that olefin dissociates to give a 14-electron iridium(I) fragment. which then reacts with ammonia. This cleavage of the N-H bond under neutral conditions provides a foundation on which to develop future mild catalytic transformations of ammonia. such as olefin hydroamination and arene oxidative amination.,True,TTciAZ0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,403,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5712/1080.abstract,1014805309511751601,/scholar?cites=1014805309511751601,,,0,0,0

A computational investigation,1993,Santo Di Bella and Ignazio L Fragala and Mark A Ratner and Tobin J Marks,115,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2,682-686,American Chemical Society,The second-order nonlinear optical response of model molecular 1: 1 and asymmetric 2: 1 organic π electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complexes is investigated using the INDO/S sum-over-excited particle-hole-states formalism. It is found that intermolecular charge-transfer transitions in EDA complexes represent a promising approach to achieving sizable second-order optical nonlinearities. Calculated hyperpolarizabilities may be generally related to the strength of the donor-acceptor interaction in the complex. affording for a given acceptor. the largest values in the case of aminoarene donors. The large change in dipole moment that accompanies intermolecular charge-transfer transitions and the relatively low-lying charge-transfer excitation energies are the major sources of the large calculated second-order nonlinearities. The relative orientation of donor and acceptor components is also an important feature. leading to stabilization of the ground state as well as to maximization of the oscillator strength of the lowest energy charge-transfer excitation and. in turn. the NLO response. In the case of asymmetric 2: 1 EDA complexes. calculated hyperpolarizability enhancements over the 1: 1 complexes can be related to the red-shift of the charge-transfer excitation as well as to an increase in dipole moment change between ground and excited states.

A (bcope)Pd(OTf)2 complex (bcope = bis(cyclooctyl)phosphine ethane. 2) with substoichiometrically added halide anions is a highly efficient homogeneous catalyst (precursor) to selectively convert internal linear alkenes into predominantly linear (detergent) alcohols under mild conditions. Halide anion-dependent effects on the hydroformylation reaction rate as well as its chemo- and regioselectivity are observed. Thus. the rate of hydroformylation of thermally equilibrated internal higher alkenes increases by a factor of about 6−7 with chloride/bromide and about a factor 3−4 with iodide. while the selectivity toward alcohols increases to almost 100% upon addition of a substoichiometric quantity (with respect to palladium) of the halide anion source.

This transformation. investigated via the methoxycarbonylation of propyne. involves a uniquely dual role for the P.

1119630,Synthesis and spectroscopy of composite semiconductor nanomaterials,2013,Robert Carl Fitzmorris,,,,,,Semiconductor nanostructures. also known as quantum dots (QDs). have shown great promise as optical materials in solar cells. light emitting devices. and as fluorescent probes.  When combined with other materials. the properties of QDs can be modified to suit a particular application.  QD heterostructures were synthesized and investigated using time resolved spectroscopy in order to understand how to control the fate of excitons.  A one pot approach to the synthesis of CdSe/ZnSe/ZnS core/shell/shell QDs was developed. and the shell growth was shown to be an effective means of extending the exciton lifetime and increasing fluorescence quantum yield.  Both the extended lifetime and increased fluorescence were attributed to passivation of surface states by the double shell.  Furthermore. this approach was adapted to alloyed CdxZn(1-x)Se QDs to produce CdxZn(1-x)Se/ZnSe/ZnS alloyed core/shell/shell QDs with high fluorescence quantum yield.  Transient absorption spectroscopy showed that the shell coating slowed exciton recombination on the ps timescale by passivating surface states.  Time resolved fluorescence revealed identical ns dynamics before and after shell growth. this was attributed to very fast surface state recombination that can is complete within a nanosecond.  In addition. homogenous CdSe/TiO2 composite nanorods and pure CdSe nanorods were grown using physical vapor deposition. SEM images showed that the CdSe and CdSe/TiO2 nanorod arrays are vertically aligned. with very similar morphology.

This in vivo pharmacology approach had the benefit of highlighting compounds that exhibited both desirable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. A major disadvantage of this approach was that an animal model was essentially a “black box”. When compounds were inactive. it was unclear whether this was because they no longer interacted with a molecular target or simply whether they had failed to reach the site of action.

Designing multi-target drugs can be challenging for medicinal chemists. with current lead-discovery strategies often producing large. complex molecules with low ligand efficiency and poor oral bioavailability.

Glycine is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the spinal cord and brain stem of vertebrates. 1 The inhibitory actions of glycine are mediated by the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor (ssGlyR). a ligand-gated chloride channel distributed throughout the spinal cord and brain stem. 2 Glycine is also known to potentate the action of glutamate acting as an essential co-agonist on postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. 3 Synaptic levels of glycine are believed to be controlled by high-affinity glycine transporters. These transporters are members of a large family of sodium/chloride-dependent transporters. which are composed of single oligomeric proteins containing 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains. 4 Molecular cloning has revealed the existence of two major classes of glycine transporter subtypes: type 1 (GlyT-1) and type 2 (GlyT-2). 5 These have now been further divided into three subtypes of GlyT-1 (a. b. and c) and two splice variant versions of GlyT-2 (a and b). 5 Recent immunocytochemical studies showed that the GlyT-1 transporter has a wide distribution throughout the CNS whereas the GlyT-2 transporter has a similar distribution to ssGlyR. being confined to the spinal cord and brain stem. 6,True,PhG8hSUAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,110,https://www.academia.edu/download/49951409/jm001127220161028-6323-1lbaih4.pdf,12979294398274529707,/scholar?cites=12979294398274529707,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49951409/jm001127220161028-6323-1lbaih4.pdf,0,0,0

The N-linked myristate is not required for anchorage to membranes because a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids close to the NH2 terminus guarantees a tight interaction of the protein with the phospholipid bilayer. Instead. the fatty acid is required for targeting of b5R to mitochondria because a nonmyristoylated mutant is exclusively localized to the ER. Here. we have investigated the mechanism by which N-linked myristate affects b5R targeting. We find that myristoylation interferes with interaction of the nascent chain with signal recognition particle. so that a portion of the nascent chains escapes from cotranslational integration into the ER and can be post-translationally targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane.

Most of the new synthesized compounds proved more reversible. potent. and selective inhibitors of MAO-A than of MAO-B. and could be taken into account to develop the search further in this field. knowing that reversible and selective MAO-A inhibitors are used as antidepressant and antianxiety drug. The 30 most active compounds show inhibitory activity on MAO-A in the 8.6 x 10-8 - 9.0 x 10-9M range.

Here. the G4 formation decreases the replicative DNA at each cell cycle. finally leading to apoptosis. The ability to control this mitotic clock. particularly in cancer cells. is fascinating and passes through a rational understanding of the ligand/G4 interaction. We demonstrate that an accurate description of the ligand/G4 binding mechanism is possible using an innovative free-energy method called funnel-metadynamics (FM). which we have recently developed to investigate ligand/protein interaction. Using FM simulations. we have elucidated the binding mechanism of the anticancer alkaloid berberine to the human telomeric G4 (d[AG3(T2AG3)3]). computing also the binding free-energy landscape. Two ligand binding modes have been identified as the lowest energy states.

In particular. paclitaxel has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of ovarian. breast. and nonsmall cell lung carcinomas. It has been shown that emergence of resistance against this agent correlates with an increase in the relative abundance of tubulin isoform βIII and that the more recently discovered IDN5390 can be effectively used once resistance has emerged. In this paper. we analyze the binding modes of these antimitotic agents to type I and III isoforms of β‐tubulin by computational methods.

1119762,Coordination polymers: design. analysis and application,2008,Stuart R Batten and Suzanne M Neville and David R Turner,,,,,Royal Society of Chemistry,The field of coordination polymer research has undergone rapid expansion in recent years. No longer are these materials the vaguely defined'insoluble material'at the bottom of your vessel that spell death for your reaction. They have gone from'polymeric rubbish'to'materials of the future'. Great leaps in the deliberate design of coordination polymers were made in the 1990s. These were allied with similar advances in related areas such as organic crystal engineering. metallosupramolecular chemistry and X-ray diffraction. No longer did we assemble things atom by atom. Whole molecules were used as building blocks and new materials were made. This is the first book to provide a broad overview of all the major facets of coordination polymer research in one place. It combines chapters on nets and interpenetration with wide-ranging surveys of transition metal and lanthanoid coordination polymers and their properties. The aim is to provide a flavour of each aspect whilst introducing the important concepts and developments using carefully selected examples. After an introduction. the text is split into three sections:-Design (nets. interpenetration. malleability)-Analysis (transition metal coordination polymers. lanthanoid coordination polymers. organometallic networks. organic-inorganic hybrids)-Application (magnetic properties. porosity. acentric and chiral networks. reactive coordination polymers. other properties). Written in the style of a tutorial review. the book is suitable for both senior specialists and new postgraduate students taking their first steps in the field.

The structures contain a discrete. strongly hydrogen-bonded water tetramer which causes a significant distortion of the metal coordination sphere in each case. Partial atomic charges and hardness analysis (PACHA) calculations reveal that the shortest hydrogen bonds are not the strongest in this constrained. cyclic solid-state structure and show that the distortion at the metal center is caused by the drive to maintain the integrity of the water tetramer. The system undergoes a disorder−order transition on slow cooling that provides insight into the nature of communication between water squares. ,True,El3294wAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,61,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja052081a,16965718874334880513,/scholar?cites=16965718874334880513,,,0,0,0

In bacteria susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics. the transpeptidase activity of their penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) is lost as a result of irreversible acylation of an active site serine by the β-lactam antibiotics.

The cause of MRSA resistance to all commercially available β-lactam antibiotics is the acquisition of the gene mecA. which encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP 2a). PBP 2a is a transpeptidase. which in contrast to the other transpeptidases of S. aureus does not experience inhibition by β-lactam antibiotics. The lack of inhibition is due to a closed conformation for the active site for PBP 2a. which opens up only in the course of the catalytic function of the protein.

Diabetic wounds are refractory to healing due to the involvement of activated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). which remodel the tissue resulting in apoptosis. There are no readily available methods that identify active unregulated MMPs. With the use of a novel inhibitor-tethered resin that binds exclusively to the active forms of MMPs. coupled with proteomics. we quantified MMP-8 and MMP-9 in a mouse model of diabetic wounds. Topical treatment with a selective MMP-9 inhibitor led to acceleration of wound healing. re-epithelialization. and significantly attenuated apoptosis. In contrast. selective pharmacological inhibition of MMP-8 delayed wound healing. decreased re-epithelialization. and exhibited high apoptosis.

The steric and electronic effects of both the salen and salan fragments have been varied in a systematic fashion to ascertain how this affects the selectivity for the ROP of rac-lactide.

As MOF research has progressed. highly functionalised materials have become desirable for specific applications. and in many cases the limitations of direct synthesis have been realised. This has resulted in the search for alternative synthetic routes. with postsynthetic modification (PSM). a term used to collectively describe the functionalisation of pre-synthesised MOFs whilst maintaining their desired characteristics. becoming a topic of interest. Advances in the scope of reactions performed are reported regularly; however reactions requiring harsh conditions can result in degradation of the framework. Zirconium-based MOFs present high chemical. thermal and mechanical stabilities. offering wider opportunities for the scope of reaction conditions that can be tolerated. which has seen a number of successful examples reported. This microreview discusses pertinent examples of PSM resulting in enhanced properties for specific applications. alongside fundamental transformations. which are categorised broadly into covalent modifications. surface transformations. metalations. linker and metal exchange. and cluster modifications.,True,XbT-VOgAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,111,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/122310/,5746193520135074558,/scholar?cites=5746193520135074558,,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/122310/1/122310.pdf,0,0,0

Typically. large excesses of monocarboxylic acids such as formic. acetic and benzoic acid are applied. but access to diffraction quality single crystals. particularly of UiO-66 topology MOFs. remains troublesome.

Most of these glues are permanent. preventing disassembly and recycling of the components. New materials are thus needed to bond and debond without releasing reactive pollutants. In order to develop the next generation of advanced adhesives we have turned to biology for inspiration. The bonding chemistry of mussel proteins was combined with preformed poly(lactic acid). a bio-based polymer. by utilizing side reactions of Sn(oct)2. to create catechol-containing copolymers. Structure–function studies revealed that bulk adhesion was comparable to that of several petroleum-based commercial glues.

Calmodulin-controlled isoforms are signal generators; calmodulin activates electron transfer from NADPH through three reductase domains to an oxygenase domain. Structures of the reductase unit and its homologs show FMN and FAD in contact but too isolated from the protein surface to permit exit of reducing equivalents. To study states in which FMN/heme electron transfer is feasible. we designed and produced constructs including only oxygenase and FMN binding domains. eliminating strong internal reductase complex interactions. Constructs for all mammalian isoforms were expressed and purified as dimers. All synthesize NO with peroxide as the electron donor at rates comparable with corresponding oxygenase constructs.
