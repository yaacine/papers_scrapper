Similar wind power plants in Europe will be taken into consideration. With the increasingly rapid development of construction technology of offshore and onshore wind power plants. costs in these types of installations are expected to decrease. This fact offers the possibility of exploiting offshore and onshore wind potential in Croatia in the near future. This study assesses the quality of possible offshore sites using the existing data. For this reason. there is a need for additional examination of wind potential by using contemporary procedures as well as selecting sites by means of a collaborative effort.

A ventilated cavity is developed on the hydrofoil surface and the growth of the cavity is uncontrolled. which can have harmful effects as it leads to changes in the lift and unexpected loads. The occurrence of ventilation is computed by a Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes solver based on the Finite Volume Method and the Volume of Fluid free surface capturing. The impact of numerical parameters on the ventilation is investigated by testing various momentum. gradient. and interface-capturing schemes. turbulence intesities. acceleration and time stepping scenarios. for 10 Froude numbers and 2 angles of attack. The analysis shows that simulations are consistent and comparable with the experimental data. if proper free surface capturing scheme and very low Courant numbers are used.,True,Kc0LuHwAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC,0,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09377255.2020.1798060,,,,,,0,0,0

The thermohydraulic performance of an air heater in terms of effective efficiency is determined on the basis of actual thermal energy gain subtracted by the primary energy required to generate power needed for pumping air through the packed bed. Based on energy transfer mechanism in the bed. a mathematical model is developed to compute effective efficiency. A design criterion is also suggested to select a matrix for packing the air flow duct of a solar air heater which results in the best thermal efficiency with minimum pumping power penalty. Resulting values of effective efficiency clearly indicate that the packed bed solar air heater investigated is thermohydraulically efficient as compared to flat plate …,True,TwK2lUwAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,143,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X05003592,13414293766254572892,/scholar?cites=13414293766254572892,,,"http://amet-me.mnsu.edu/userfilesshared/solarwall/Technical%20Papers%20and%20%20Documents/Flat%20Plate%20Collector/Optimal%20thermohydraulic%20performance%20of%20a%20wire%20mesh%20packed%20solar%20air%20heater%20-%20M.K.%20Mittal,%20L.%20Varshney.pdf",0,0,0

Table1 clearly indicates that India’s petroleum product consumption has increased from 1× 109 tons in 2001-02 to 1.3× 109 t in 2008-09 at a CAGR of 4.1% and is likely to increase up to 2.2× 109 t by 2020-21 and 3.3× 109 t by 2030-31. resulting in the steep rise of under-recoveries of oil marketing companies at different levels of crude prices. This makes it difficult for the government to subsidize petroleum products in the future.

1306957,THERMAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF A PACKED BED SOLAR AIR HEATER HAVING ROUNDED TIP V-GROOVED ABSORBER,2019,AD Gupta and Ashish Gupta and L Varshney and Yashi Gupta,,,,,,The fast depleting conventional energy resources and problems regarding pollution and global warming have made it inevitable to think about cleaner and sustainable form of energy. One such form of energy is solar energy. which has got great potential especially for countries like India because of abundant insolation available due to their geographical location. The utilization of this form of energy can easily be achieved for low temperature applications using flat plate solar collectors. which have a wide range of applications viz. domestic and industrial water heating. drying of agricultural products such as fruits and grains. green house chambers. space heating. solar refrigeration and air conditioning etc. Conventional solar air collectors have inherent disadvantages viz low thermal efficiency due to low value of specific heat of air. In order to increase the thermal efficiency of conventional collectors different techniques have been proposed for thermal performance improvement [1-6]. These techniques include enhancement of heat transfer coefficient between absorber plate to working fluid and reduction of top losses etc.The enhancement of heat transfer coefficient can be achieved in several ways. such as the use of artificial roughness which disturbs the viscous boundary layer of the flowing fluid and thus augmenting the heat transfer rates. Use of finned plate absorber surface causes an increase in the turbulence of air flowing through the duct. increasing the thermal performance with limited increase in pressure drop. Use of rounded tip V-grooved absorber plate proves to be beneficial in increasing the effective absorbing area as compared to the …,True,TwK2lUwAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashish_Gupta160/publication/348659728_Corresponding_author_THERMAL_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_OF_A_PACKED_BED_SOLAR_AIR_HEATER_HAVING_ROUNDED_TIP_V-GROOVED_ABSORBER/links/6009a4e692851c13fe296c00/Corresponding-author-THERMAL-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS-OF-A-PACKED-BED-SOLAR-AIR-HEATER-HAVING-ROUNDED-TIP-V-GROOVED-ABSORBER.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashish_Gupta160/publication/348659728_Corresponding_author_THERMAL_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_OF_A_PACKED_BED_SOLAR_AIR_HEATER_HAVING_ROUNDED_TIP_V-GROOVED_ABSORBER/links/6009a4e692851c13fe296c00/Corresponding-author-THERMAL-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS-OF-A-PACKED-BED-SOLAR-AIR-HEATER-HAVING-ROUNDED-TIP-V-GROOVED-ABSORBER.pdf,0,0,0

Reynolds number (Re) was taken from 3000 to 12000. relative gap position (bꞌ/b) was taken from 0.3 to 0.9 and relative roughness pitch (p/e) was taken as 10. Other parameters like relative roughness height (e/D) of 0.0354. arc angle (α) of 30. relative staggered rib size (r/e) of 2.5 and Relative staggered rib position (pꞌ/p) of 0.2 are kept constant. From the experimental results it is concluded that the value of (THPP) is higher for combination of broken arc and staggered ribs as compared to that for a continuous arc shaped ribs. It was found that (THPP) is highest in case of (bꞌ/b) as 0.6 which ranges from 2.09 to 2.46 for a (Re) of 3000 to 12000 respectively. Enhancement in (THPP) is estimated to be 33% higher for combination of broken arc and staggered ribsas compared with continuous arc shaped rib roughness.,True,TwK2lUwAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,https://www.ripublication.com/ijaerspl2019/ijaerv14n9spl_21.pdf,,,,,https://www.ripublication.com/ijaerspl2019/ijaerv14n9spl_21.pdf,0,0,0

The feed configurations considered are backward feed (BF). forward feed (FF). parallel feed (PF) and parallel cross feed (PCF). The model results indicate that the PCF configuration has better performance characteristics than the other feed configurations regarding gain output ratio (GOR) and specific heat consumption (SHC). but it has the highest specific cooling seawater flow rate (sMcw). On the other hand. the BF configuration has the lowest sMcw. The highest exergy destruction (58%) occurs within the TVC unit and this can be reduced by lowering the supplied motive steam pressure.

Adding thermal vapor compressor (TVC) unit with the last effect of parallel/cross configuration is also studied and compared to the other configurations to show the advantage of this type of integration. The transient operation is achieved by applying ramp changes (disturbances) in the main input parameters that include steam flow rate at the heat source and cooling seawater temperature and flow rate at the heat sink.

Darcy–Brinkman equation is solved in both the porous layers and the vapor passage. Silica-gel/water is selected as a working pair. Heat and mass diffusion time are calculated from the scaling analysis of the governing equations. Results show that reducing particle diameter and adsorbent bed thickness while enhancing the bed thermal conductivity can lead to a dramatic improvement in specific cooling power (SCP). Also. the feeding vapor passage is needed for particle size smaller than 0.5 mm but it can be removed for bigger particles.

1306982,Effect of a Slotted Shield on Thermal and Hydraulic Performance of a Heat Sink,2014,Mohamed L Elsayed and Osama Mesalhy,137,Journal of Electronic Packaging,1,011004,American Society of Mechanical Engineers,The attachment of a shield to a heat sink enhances the thermal performance. But. forming slots in the shield increases thermal resistance. We found that increasing the slot width enhances the flow performance over the heat sink and this improvement continues as the number of slots increases. but the thermal performance. on the other hand. decreases. Slots work as a flow bypass and create jets to destroy eddies and vortices created by the shield. Therefore. pressure drop at Re¼ 55.000 for a slotted case is about 80% lower than a solid shield. For suitable thermal resistance and moderate pressure drop. the appropriate slotted shield will have 3–7 slots at different slot widths. These slots preserve the improvement of thermal resistance with a suitable pressure drop.[DOI: 10.1115/1.4027920],True,BXW8YY-uRJ4C:u-x6o8ySG0sC,8,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/electronicpackaging/article/137/1/011004/367547,8061621629728341157,/scholar?cites=8061621629728341157,,,,0,0,0

Excellent agreement is observed when the simulation results are compared with available experimental data in the literature. Under the first inlet condition. the Nusselt numbers associated with the full shield installation are significantly higher than those without a shield. but with a significant pressure drop penalty. Friction factor increases with partial shield height till it reaches a maximum value with the full-shield configuration. Using an inclined guide plate with a partial shield alters the flow direction. forcing the air to impinge on the heat sink.

The bed is modular in nature and thus can be scaled for a given cooling load. An experimental setup is built to measure the adsorption kinetics of the proposed bed under typical operating conditions. In addition. a transient three-dimensional local thermal equilibrium (LTE) model is developed to study heat and mass transfer inside the bed. The Darcy equation and linear driving force (LDF) model are solved simultaneously to account for inter-particle and intra-particle mass diffusion. respectively. Silica gel RD-2060/water is chosen as the working pair. The influence of the bed porosity. bed thickness. bed height and convective heat transfer coefficient on the specific cooling power (SCP) is investigated. Good agreement between the experimental measurements and the numerical results is obtained. The results show that a reduction in the bed porosity increases the adsorbent density and leads to a lower SCP. Additionally. a decrease in the bed thickness results in a pronounced increase in the SCP. However. a small bed thickness means a small module size. which leads to a high parasitic penalty in the metal-to-adsorbent mass ratio. The SCP is found to be insensitive to the convective heat transfer coefficient when it is over 400 W/m 2· K. because the dominant thermal resistance is due to the low thermal conductivity of the adsorbent. The results show that the proposed bed produces a SCP of 350 W/kg of silica-gel after 500 s of adsorption.,True,BXW8YY-uRJ4C:_FxGoFyzp5QC,5,"http://dl.astfe.org/conferences/tfec2018,1b3dfbdd05fecfc7,690615461ac47570.html?sgstd=1",14087583363259503050,/scholar?cites=14087583363259503050,,,http://dl.astfe.org/download/article/690615461ac47570/TFEC-2018-21615-2_N.pdf,0,0,0

Due to the high-power density required for EMAs in aircraft applications. they are prone to overheating. Pushing the wing-bay air on a finned EMA surface using axial flow fans is the most practical way to cool the EMAs used for flight control surfaces. The probability of failure of the commercial fans is 2 × 10−5 which is too high compared to the desired failure probability of 10−9 for the EMAs. This paper presents a validated numerical simulation to assess the performance of dual fans in cooling EMAs. The two fans are set in a series arrangement due to the space limitation in the wing bay.

The conventional MED system uses hot water as the heat source by recuperating the waste heat from the sCO2 cycle. The MED-MVC system uses a vapor compressor to eliminate the need to condense the water vapor in the last effect of the MED system. The advantage of the MED-MVC is the ability to recuperate part of the waste heat of the sCO2 cycle through preheating the seawater feed directed to the first effect. Forward feed configuration is selected since high feed temperature can be accommodated for the MED-MVC.

1306988,Effect of Changes In Input Parameters on The Operation of A MED-TVC Plant,2018,Mohamed L Elsayed and Osama Mesalhy and Ramy H Mohammed and Louis C Chow,,,2379-1748,709-723,,Multi-Effect-Desalination (MED) process is an attractive approach for desalination because of the combination of low economic costs and low energy consumption. especially when it is combined with electricity cogeneration using solar or waste heat. However MED may be exposed to fluctuations in input parameters during operation. Therefore. there is a requirement to analyze the transient behavior of such MED systems. In this work. a dynamic model is developed by solving the time-dependent conservation equations of mass. energy and salt using available data from a MED with thermal vapor compression unit (MED-TVC) plant installed in western UAE. The model is validated with experimental data available in the literature. The model is then used to examine the effect of the fluctuations of the main operational parameters on the plant behavior and performance. The results show an increase in the total production of fresh water when the cooling seawater flow rate decreases which leads to a higher Gained Output Ratio (GOR). On the contrary. a reduction in cooling sea water temperature leads to a lower fresh water production and GOR. It is also noted that a change in motive steam flow rate has only a slight effect on the GOR. For the current MED-TVC configuration and dimensions. it is recommended to limit the reduction in the seawater cooling flow rate to under 12% of the steady state value to avoid evaporators dry out. Also. a reduction in the motive steam flow rate and cooling seawater temperature of more than 20% and 35% of the steady state values may lead to evaporators flooding.,True,BXW8YY-uRJ4C:ufrVoPGSRksC,1,"http://dl.astfe.org/conferences/tfec2018,63f20a1a4259bbcb,0323e3150328048f.html?sgstd=1",6182378925182080493,/scholar?cites=6182378925182080493,,,http://dl.astfe.org/download/article/0323e3150328048f/TFEC-2018-21614-2_N.pdf,0,0,0

The lignite used in this study is Tunçbilek lignite (TL). which is blended with two biomasses. olive residue (OR) and almond shell (AS). and the inorganic industrial waste. magnesite dust (MD). The blends are composed of various weight fractions of fuels. with a constant weight fraction of molasses (10% by weight) as a binding agent. TGA weight loss trends are used to obtain characteristic temperatures and to define weight conversion stages. Experimental results show three distinct stages of conversion during combustion of biomass fuels and two stages for lignite.

Extraction of the needles and stumps shows greater yields of resin acids. terpenes. steroids and other derivatives than that of pinewood bark. cones and branches. The char yields of both non-treated and scCO2 extracted wood fractions varied from approximately 17.5 to 38.5 wt. % on dry basis at fast heating rates. The catalytic effect of extractives is significant on the yields and morphology of solid chars in fast pyrolysis and less pronounced at slow heating rates.

SO2 and CO) and the particulate emissions (ash) from burning of pulverized coals and biomasses under either conventional combustion in air or oxy-fuel combustion conditions. Oxy-fuel combustion is a ‘clean-coal’process that takes place in O2/CO2 environments. which are achieved by removing nitrogen from the intake gases and recirculating large amounts of flue gases to the boiler. Removal of nitrogen from the combustion gases generates a high CO2-content. sequestration-ready gas at the boiler effluent. Flue gas recirculation moderates the high temperatures caused by the elevated oxygen partial pressure in the boiler. In this study. combustion of the fuels took place in a laboratory laminar-flow droptube furnace (DTF). electrically-heated to 1400 K. in environments containing various mole fractions of oxygen in either nitrogen or carbon-dioxide background gases.The effects of replacing background N2 gas with CO2 (to simulate oxy-combustion conditions) on gaseous and particulate emissions were observed by monitoring them under both O2/N2 and O2/CO2 environments and results were presented in this study. In the case of four coals (a bituminous. a sub-bituminous. two lignites). bagasse and coal/bagasse blends studied. NOx emissions in O2/CO2 environments were lower than those in O2/N2 environments.

Oxy-fuel combustion is a process that takes place in O2/CO2 environments. which are achieved by removing nitrogen from the intake gases and recirculating large amounts of flue gases to the boiler; this is done to moderate the high temperatures caused by the elevated oxygen partial pressure therein. In this study. combustion took place in a laboratory laminar-flow drop-tube furnace (DTF) in environments in either air or oxy-fuel conditions.

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of the submicron particles and SEM coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) technique was used for the chemical analysis of the PM1. Bimodal ash particle size distributions were observed in the submicron region. Mass fractions of the major metal oxides in submicron ash particles also showed a bimodal distribution. Both the submicron emission yield and the major metal oxides in the submicron particles were typically lower in oxy-fuel condition than those in air.

The sequence of un-overlapped peaks extracted from the X-ray powder diffraction pattern could be indexed with a primitive cubic cell with lattice parameter a = 7.319 Å. The diffraction patterns of the peaks are matched with the Pa-3 space group. The stoichiometry of the hydrogen absorption reaction suggests the presence of a high-boron content phase in the compound under investigation.

However. the PV system has a non-linear output characteristic because of weather intermittency. which tends to a substantial loss in overall system output. Thus. to optimize the output of the PV system. maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques are used to track the global maximum power point (GMPP) and extract the maximum power from the PV system under different weather conditions with better precision. Since MPPT is an essential part of the PV system. to date. many MPPT methods have been developed by various researchers. each with unique features. A Google Scholar survey of the last five years (2015–2020) was performed to investigate the number of review articles published. It was found that overall. seventy-one review articles were published on different MPPT techniques; out of those. only four were on non-uniform solar irradiance. and seven review articles included shading conditions. Unfortunately. very few attempts were made in this regard. Therefore. a comprehensive review paper on this topic is needed. in which almost all the well-known MPPT techniques should be encapsulated in one document.

MgO and Mg (OH) 2 were synthesized from the salt Mg (NO 3)· 6H 2 O by performing hydrothermal reactions with various precipitating agents. The precipitating agents were NaOH. KOH. NH 3. NH 3 with pamoic acid (PA). or (NH 4) 2 CO 3. The result shows that the selection of the precipitating agent has a significant impact on the crystallite structure. size. and shape of the final products. Of the precipitating agents tested. only NaOH and NH 3 with PA produce single-phase Mg (OH) 2 as the as-synthesized product. Pore size distribution analyses revealed that the surfaces of the as-synthesized MgO have a slit-like pore structure with a broad-type pore size distribution. whereas the as-synthesized Mg (OH) 2 has a mesoporous structure with a narrow pore size distribution. This structure enhances the latent heat of the phase change material (PCM) as well as super cooling mitigation. The PEG/Mg (OH) 2 PCM also exhibits reproducible behavior over a large number of thermal cycles. Both MgO and Mg (OH) 2 matrices prevent the leakage of liquid PEG during the phase transition in phase change materials (PCMs). However. MgO/PEG has a low impregnation ratio and efficiency. with a low thermal storage capability. This is due to the large pore diameter. which does not allow MgO to retain a larger amount of PEG.

This process is achieved by adapting the support vector-based data description technique with Gaussian radial basis function kernels for islanding and non-islanding events in single phase grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems. To overcome the non-detection zone. excess and deficit power imbalance conditions are considered for different loading conditions. These imbalances are characterized by the voltage dip scenario and were subjected to feature extraction for training with the machine learning technique. This is experimentally realized by training the machine learning classifier with different events on a 5 kW grid-connected system. Using the concept of detection and false alarm rates. the performance of the trained classifier is tested for multiple faults and power imbalance conditions. The results showed the effective operation of the classifier with a detection rate of 99.2% and a false alarm rate of 0.2%.

IL (United States),The current international energy situation has brought about serious concerns in most of the developed countries about their use of fossil fuels and their need for developing renewable energy sources. This energy crisis takes place in the context of oil-stock reduction and a dramatic demand increase from developing countries. A study by M. Wang (2006) shows that Chinese on-road vehicles could consume up to 20.6 million bbl of oil per day by 2050. Moreover. China could face a tremendous increase in highway vehicles (including cars. trucks. and buses) in the next 40 years. Indeed. depending upon the case scenario developed in the study. there could be between 486 and 662 million highway vehicles in China in 2050. compared to roughly 27 million in 2004. Such a dramatic evolution could have severe impacts on climate change and on the oil market. The dilemma cannot be solved without creating new energy and/or transportation systems that either consume less oil or are not dependent on oil.With a consumption of almost 20 million bbl/day. the United States is by far the world’s highest-oil-consuming country (Central Intelligence Agency. 2008). As illustrated in Error!

1307080,Validation of Sizing Algorithm for Several Vehicle Powertrains,2016,Aymeric Rousseau Namdoo Kim and Ayman Moawad,,,,,,The US Department of Energy Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) is developing more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly highway transportation technologies that will enable America to use less petroleum. The VTP has a program that studies the potential benefits of advanced technologies and attempts to clarify and refine the requirements for vehicle components. Working with VTO. Argonne National Laboratory researchers have developed automated sizing processes to define the requirements of each component system for several powertrain applications.This paper describes the sizing algorithms for different powertrains. Because of the impact of the component max-torque shapes. maintaining a constant power-to-weight ratio among several powertrains leads to an inconsistent comparison between technologies. Therefore. each powertrain has a unique algorithm to meet specific vehicle technical specifications. This paper also validates the sizing algorithm using assumptions from current production vehicles. Vehicle sizing results for several vehicles are compared with the corresponding values for vehicles in the market today.,True,uxjaZf8AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayman_Moawad/publication/312275053_Validation_of_Sizing_Algorithm_for_Several_Vehicle_Powertrains/links/5877fd1e08ae6eb871d18fca.pdf,13448950995669443943,/scholar?cites=13448950995669443943,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayman_Moawad/publication/312275053_Validation_of_Sizing_Algorithm_for_Several_Vehicle_Powertrains/links/5877fd1e08ae6eb871d18fca.pdf,0,0,0

In developing a transportation system deployment model. the energy impact of the model is extremely valuable for sustainability and validation. It is expected that different penetration levels of Connected-Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) will impact travel behavior due to changes in potential factors such as congestion. miles traveled. etc. Along with such impact analyses. it is also important to further quantify the regional energy impact of CAV deployment under different factors of interest. The objective of this paper is to study the energy consumption of electrified vehicles in the future for different penetration levels of CAVs deployment in the City of Chicago. The paper will further provide a statistical analysis of the results to evaluate the impact of the different penetration levels on the different electrified powertrains used in the study.

1307093,How Maltose Binding Proteins Recognize Substrates: Insights from Computer Simulations,2012,Cornelius Audu and Yan Zhou and Jingzhi Pu,,,,,Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research,As a periplasmic component of the Maltose transporter system. the Maltose binding protein (MBP) is known to be able to capture the substrate with high affinity and load it to the entrance of the transmembrane portion of the transporter to initiate the ATP facilitated substrate transportation. Such substrate recognition and binding events trigger a large conformational change in MBP. as suggested from several X-ray crystal structures that capture MBP in an “open” or a “closed” state. To characterize the dynamical natures of these conformational states. we performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of MBP under three conditions: (1) a closed structure with ligand. (2) a closed structure without ligand. and (3) an open structure without ligand. Based on these equilibrium simulations and additional transition pathway simulations using Targeted Molecular Dynamics (TMD). possible reaction coordinates to describe the conformational change of MBP will be identified. Finally. free energy profiles of the conformational transition will be obtained by umbrella sampling simulations and the molecular recognition mechanism of MBP will be discussed.,True,3r4atjQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/7421,,,,,,0,0,0

I establish that there is substantial heterogeneity in the long-run effect of manufacturing output on demand across five commodities. A one percent increase in per capita manufacturing output leads to an approximately 1.5 percent increase in aluminum demand and a roughly 1 percent rise in copper demand. Estimated elasticities for lead. tin. and zinc are below unity. My results suggest that the experience of Japan and South Korea’s industrialization. for example. may be used to infer the impact of China’s industrialization on future demand for metals.

Why have resources not become scarcer as suggested by standard economic theory? We develop a theory of extraction technology. geology and growth grounded in stylized facts. Rising resource demand incentivises firms to invest in new technology to increase their economically extractable reserves. Prices remain constant because increasing returns from the geological distribution of resources offset diminishing returns in innovation. As a result. the aggregate growth rate depends partly on the geological distribution of resources. For example. a greater average concentration of a resource in the Earth's crust leads to more resource extraction. a lower price and a higher growth rate on the balanced growth path.

Raising tax revenues from the extractive sector in sub-Saharan Africa during the commodity price boom,2010,Martin Stürmer,,German Development Institute Discussion Paper,7/2010,,,High mineral and energy commodity prices shook world commodity markets from 2003 to 2008. Taking three case study countries as examples. this paper shows that sub-Saharan African countries collected only relatively low tax revenues from the extractive sector. unlike such classical mining countries as Australia. Corruption and patronage in the granting of concessions and in tax administration cause low implicit tax rates. Poor conditions impede investments in downstream processing industries and additional production. As a consequence. sales revenues and hence the tax base are relatively lower than in Australia. for example. We present estimates of potential tax revenues for the three case study countries and for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. Applying Australia’s implicit tax rate to sub-Saharan Africa’s sales revenues. tax revenues in sub-Saharan Africa could have been equivalent to 35 per cent of official development assistance (ODA) from 2003 to 2008.

1307133,What Drives Mineral Commodity Markets in the Long Run?,2013,Martin Stürmer,,,,,Universitäts-und Landesbibliothek Bonn,This thesis analyzes the long-run development of mineral commodity markets both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. The first chapter presents a model that replicates long-term trends in non-renewable resource markets. namely stable prices and exponentially increasing extraction. for which we present data from 1792 to 2010. We add an extractive sector to an endogenous growth model of expanding varieties and directed technological change. Extractive firms can draw down resource stocks through extraction. but also renew stocks through investment in new extraction technology. Our results suggest that technological change in extraction technologies offsets the increasing demand for non-renewable resources in industrializing countries like China in the long run. In the second chapter I provide long-term evidence on the dynamic effects of supply and demand shocks on mineral commodity prices. I explore a new annual data-set on prices and production of copper. lead. tin. zinc. and crude oil from 1840 to 2010. Long-term price fluctuations are mainly driven by persistent''world output-driven demand shocks''and''other demand shocks''. Historical accounts of market events suggest that''other demand shocks''mainly capture changes in inventories. Due to oligopolistic industry structures.''supply shocks''exhibit some effects on the prices of tin and copper. but not on the prices of lead and zinc. Subsample results for crude oil indicate that during earlier periods''supply shocks''have been important drivers.

1307136,The international raw materials boom: A challenge for multilateral trade policy,2008,Martin Stürmer,,Internationale Politik und Gesellschaft,,,,Metallic raw materials are fundamentally distinguished from manufactured goods in terms of their high demand inelasticity. This means that when the market price increases. demand falls only a little in the short term. The specific characteristics of metallic raw materials can often be only poorly substituted by other metals or materials. Take copper. for example. as a conductive material for electricity or heat; possible substitutes. such as silver and gold. are either too expensive or. as in the case of aluminum. not equally robust. 1The supply side is similarly inelastic; that is. despite increasing prices it is often not possible to increase supply in the short term. To be sure. metallic raw materials are available in sufficient quantities. in geological terms; the earth’s crust comprises 8.1 percent w/w aluminum and up to 6.3 percent w/w iron. Even rarer metals. such as copper. represent longterm resources. comprising 0.0068 percent w/w of the total mass of the earth’s crust. Moreover. metals are recyclable. Shortages on world markets can arise. however. when increasing demand cannot be matched by new supply over the short term. It often takes 6–10 years to bring new mines into production. Frequently. a new works infrastructure including energy. water. roads. and accommodation has first to be established in remote areas. Licensing procedures take time. The necessary machinery. such as excavators. can have two-year waiting lists for orders. Furthermore. the discovery of suitable deposits is extremely risky. These factors make expanding raw materials supply a capital-intensive and time-consuming process. The recycling of metals also has its limits.

However. generating government revenues from the mining and oil sectors is not easy. and revenues are highly volatile owing to changing world market prices. Most sub-Saharan African countries are failing to tap the full potential for government revenues from the extractive sector because of a lack of transparency. widespread corruption and inadequate tax administration and collection. Agreements between governments and private investors are often unsatisfactory with regard to the government revenues because of power imbalances. There is also a lack of revenue management and of good investment conditions. such as a functioning infrastructure. Overall. the extractive sector could play an important role in generating domestic public revenues for achieving the MDGs. but short-term contributions should not be overestimated. Advanced mining countries. such as Canada and Australia. show that good public and corporate governance determine whether the extractive sector contributes to a country’s development or not. Sub-Saharan African countries need help with the generation of government revenues and the long-term development of the extractive sector. Transparency is one of the first cornerstones.

Due to its geological nature. the region has an enormous potential for new discoveries in the long term. The recent boom in mineral commodity prices has raised the awareness that revenue from the mining sector could enable resource-rich countries in Africa to mobilise additional domestic funds towards improving their economy and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However. there are a number of economic hurdles to overcome in order to transform geological endowments into government income. Indeed. one could say that tax revenue drawn from the extractive sector is not easy money. To date. there is also a lack of medium and long-term projections as to the extent the extractive sector can make a difference for tax revenue. especially for non-major oil producing Sub-Saharan countries. Here. we present a scenario-based method for estimating tax revenue from the extractive sector. Our results show that in the cases of Ghana.

The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). CO stripping voltammetry and single cell performance measurements. Based on XRD and STEM results. PtRuSnO2/C catalyst exhibited a slightly smaller particle size than PtRu/C catalyst due to the addition of SnO2. CO stripping voltammetry showed that SnO2 promoted CO electro-oxidation on PtRuSnO2/C catalyst at low potential. And PtRuSnO2/C catalyst gave a better single cell performance under 500 ppm CO-contaminated H2.

For that matter. dolomite. a natural material was used as a catalyst in this work. and this included potassium oxide (K 2 O)-doped dolomite. 5 wt% K/D. 10 wt% K/D. 15 wt% K/D. and 20 wt% K/D. X-ray diffraction analysis of dolomite revealed the CaO and MgO phases with high crystallinity. in which intensity reduced after doped with varying concentrations of K 2 O. When the catalysts were evaluated. the K 2 O-doped dolomite exhibited a better catalytic activity for palm oil transesterification. In the presence of K 2 O. the methyl ester reached 98.7%. with the highest being displayed by 15 wt% K/D as compared to 87% over dolomite at reaction temperature of 60 C. 12: 1 methanol to palm oil ratio. 1 wt% catalyst amount and 1 h reaction time. SEM revealed that as more K 2 O was doped on dolomite. the particles became more agglomerated. with a reduced BET surface area of 1.3 m 2/g in 20 wt% K/D as opposed to homogeneously small-sized MgO and CaO particles in dolomite with a high BET surface area of 19.0 m 2/g. However. the high activity of the doped catalyst was dictated by the high amount of basic site. as evidenced in TPD-CO 2 which showed an increase in the capacity of the basic site with an increased amount of K 2 O. The catalyst was also reusable up to six times with a negligible decrease in activity due to K+ leaching.

The global market survey has shown a skyrocketing demand for biodiesel due to its nontoxic and environmentally benign compared to that of the fossil fuel. Biodiesel which has physical and chemical characteristics similar to the diesel fuel has high flash point. high cetane number. and better lubrication. Since most of the commercial biodiesel nowadays is produced from plant oils. it does not contains sulfur. particulate matter of unburnt hydrocarbons. and other greenhouse gases (GHG) that is normally produced when dealing with a conventional engine that runs on diesel fuel. Majority of commercial biodiesel or fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) is produced from edible oils such as soybean. palm. rapeseed. and sunflower oil through transesterification reaction in alcohol (mainly methanol) at the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts [1]. Studies have shown that the use of base catalysts including. sodium methoxide. potassium hydroxide. sodium hydroxide. and calcium-based catalysts were extensively reported as a most efficient catalyst in the transesterification reaction for the production of biodiesel. Calcium methoxide for instance. has been reported to yield almost 98% biodiesel within 2 h reaction of soybean oil with methanol [ 2].

The OMSC catalyst was characterized using acid-base titration. elemental analysis. XRD. Raman. FTIR. XPS. TPD-NH 3. TGA-DTA. SEM. and N 2 adsorption–desorption analysis to reveal its properties. Results proved that the OMSC catalyst is mesoporous and amorphous in structure with improved textural. acidic. and thermal properties. Both FTIR and XPS confirmed the presence of-SO 3 H.-OH. and-COOH functional groups on the surface of the catalyst. The OMSC catalyst was found to be efficient in catalyzing glycerol conversion to acetin via an acetylation reaction with acetic acid within a short period of 3 h.

However. as was shown in the 1990s. when sputtering is performed at pressures high enough to trigger volume nucleation/condensation of the supersaturated vapor generated by the magnetron. various kinds of nanoparticles may also be produced. This finding gave rise to the rapid development of magnetron-based gas aggregation sources. Such systems were successfully used for the production of single material nanoparticles from metals. metal oxides. and plasma polymers. In addition. the growing interest in multi-component heterogeneous nanoparticles has led to the design of novel systems for the gas-phase synthesis of such nanomaterials. including metal/plasma polymer nanoparticles. In this featured article. we briefly summarized the principles of the basis of gas-phase nanoparticles production and highlighted recent progress made in the field of the fabrication of multi-component nanoparticles.

This contribution reveals that this bioactivity. as assessed by simulated body fluid (SBF). can also be considerably modified by the bioceramic's morphology. i.e.. bioactivity is also governed by microstructure and surface morphology. When crystals are forced to adopt out‐of‐equilibrium crystal habit. this simple change in morphology converts an essentially bioinert material. here calcite. into a bioceramic which shows bioactivity in SBF.

Relying on a panel dataset consisting of information from 1207 CDM wind projects in thirty provinces over the period 2004-2011. we find strong evidence on the dominant role of the epidemic effect and new evidence on pecuniary effects that generate a diminishing marginal effect of profitability in inducing technology adoption. Our numerical simulation demonstrates that the epidemic effect can play a quantitatively important role in the spread of renewable energy technology and markedly enhance the optimal social welfare. Our findings convey important policy implications for regulators when choosing policy instruments to enhance the diffusion and adoption of clean technology. Price instruments should be complemented by a wide range of non-market instruments to address non-market barriers.

Typically. the regulators face challenges of incomplete and imperfect information on the minimum improvement in energy intensity that industries would achieve in baseline cases and the maximum technical potential of energy efficiency that industries are able to achieve. By applying a two-tier stochastic frontier model based on provincial panel data 2006–2015 in China. we disentangle the impacts of information asymmetry between the governments and firms on industrial energy intensity from other major regulatory. technological and economic factors. Results show that. on average. nearly 75% of the unexplained variation in industrial energy intensity is attributed to the information gap between firms and governments.

We construct a data set comprising value-added and energy use data on 18 productive sectors in 47 economies over the period 2000–2015. First. we analyze the cross-economy distribution of energy productivity. Compared with 2000. this distribution shifted more toward the world average level in 2015. By using an index decomposition approach. we disentangle energy efficiency effect and economic structure effect as key determinants of the overall energy productivity improvement. Our results show that energy productivity progress is to a large extent driven by technological change but offset by economic structural change. Second. we explore the long-run distribution of energy productivity. Diverse patterns of energy productivity changes across these economies contradict the implicit assumption of standard convergence analysis. To address this issue. we adopt the Markov chain transition matrix. In a long-run steady state. around 64% of sample economies upgrade toward the upper end of the whole distribution. with their energy productivity performing better than the world average. Around 18% of sample economies remain at a level lower than the world average.

Along with growing urban areas. public infrastructures. such as streetlights. are also expanding. Unfortunately. energy conservation measures in public facilities are commonly constrained by the budget limitations of local governments. while the potential participation of an ESCO requires regulation reformation to settle the contradicting regulations. This study proposes several policy recommendations to modify existing guidelines for selecting ESCOs to manage energy efficiency of streetlights in Indonesia. A regulation review and several suggestions for potential improvements for selecting ESCOs are provided. In 2017. the Ministry of Domestic Affairs released a circular letter with a view to solving barriers to ESCO businesses in public sectors; however. the circular letter could be improved in several ways by eliminating the clauses on holders of intellectual property rights. revising the valuation of economic benefit bidding. and increasing the maximum contract period.

While green buildings have an overall low penetration rate in ASEAN. when compared to the rest of the world. a relatively large proportion of green bond proceeds in ASEAN have been channeled to financing green buildings. Green bonds hold vast potential as a financing mechanism. and the importance of green bonds as a funding source for green buildings in ASEAN is projected to increase in the future.

Debt-and self-financed projects are expected to contribute only a third of this capital due to multiple barriers. On the one hand. self-financed projects require upfront capital from companies’ budgets to be spent on EE. which most would regard as a noncore activity. On the other hand. multiple parties face hurdles in a debt-financed project: 1) banks deem EE transactions too small and risky; and 2) most energy service companies (ESCOs) do not have creditworthy balance sheets. Leasing agreements also have unattractive rates and extract too much project value from ESCOs and/or end users. Altogether. these constraints call for nonmainstream. off-balance sheet financial structures that will shift project risks to third parties and facilitate market benefits. such as collateralization of energy savings and engagement of SMEs. Such structures include ESCO performance contracts. public–private partnership transactions. ESCO guarantee funds. super ESCOs. and other equity channels.

Derived normalization factors allow “to move” the building from one climate to another with corresponding changes in heating. cooling. and electric lighting energy. Degree days. solar-air temperature and economic insulation thickness were used to normalize space heating and cooling needs. Solar-air temperature based degree days resulted in 5% accuracy in space heating and dry-bulb air temperature based cooling degree days were trustworthy in cooling need normalization. To overcome the limitation of the same thermal insulation in all climates. an economic insulation thickness was applied. Existing and nearly zero energy requirements were contrasted in four countries with a reference office building to analyze the impacts of climate and national regulation on primary energy use. By applying standard energy calculation input data and primary energy factors from European standards to buildings with national technical solutions. nearly zero energy building requirements comparison with European Commission benchmarks was possible to conduct.

Occupants’ symptoms were suspected to be related to the impurities leaked indoors through the building envelope. The study’s aim was to determine whether a positive pressure of 5–7 Pa prevents the infiltration of harmful chemical and microbiological agents from structures. thus decreasing symptoms and discomfort. Ventilation intervention was conducted in a building section comprising 12 classrooms and was completed with IAQ measurements and occupants’ questionnaires. After intervention. the concentration of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) decreased. and occupants’ negative perceptions became more moderate compared to those for other parts of the building. The indoor mycobiota differed in species composition from the outdoor mycobiota. and changed remarkably with the intervention. indicating that some species may have emanated from an indoor source before the intervention.

One of the buildings was an assembly hall with air heating system and the other was a warehouse equipped with radiant heating (primary) and air heating (secondary) system. The objective of the study was to determine the differences of vertical temperature gradient in halls during the winter. The findings from this study were used in dynamic whole-year simulations for estimating the heating and ventilation energy differences. The results showed about 0.2 K/m vertical temperature gradients in both halls. which was smaller by a factor of 5 for air heating than guidebook. This difference was likely because of the building being ventilated and well insulated. Temperature gradients kept reasonably constant at all measured outdoor temperatures.

An apartment building with standardized input data from the prEN 16798-1 was used as a reference building. Energy simulations were conducted both with standardized and national input data. as the latter was needed for comparing with the national NZEB requirements. In this comparison. various technical solutions were selected so that the building complied with EC recommendations. Then the technical solutions were adjusted to achieve the closest compliance with the national NZEB requirements in the four selected EU countries. The technical solutions showing the highest energy performance highlighted the strictest national NZEB requirements. Energy performance with national NZEB solutions was benchmarked against the EC recommendation by using input data representing a standard use and applying the ISO 52000-1: 2017 primary energy factors (PEF). Results showed that the direct comparison of the building energy performance between the EC recommendation and the national NZEB primary energy values produced inconsistent results because of the variation of both the PEF and the energy calculation input data in national regulations. The simulation of national NZEB technical solutions done with the prEN 16798-1 input data and the ISO 52000-1: 2017 PEF showed that the primary energy use in the reference building met the EC recommendation in Estonia only.

1307293,Modeling an Alternate Operational Ground Source Heat Pump for Combined Space Heating and Domestic HotWater Power Sizing,2019,Kaiser Ahmed and Jevgeni Fadejev and Jarek Kurnitski,12,Energies,11,,MDPI,This study developed an alternate operational control system for ground source heat pumps (GSHP). which was applied to determine combined space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) power equations at design temperature. A domestic GSHP with an alternate control system was implemented in a whole building simulation model following the heat deficiency for space heating based on degree minute counting. A simulated GSHP system with 200 L storage tank resulted in 13%–26% power reduction compared to the calculation of the same system with existing European standards. which required separate space heating and DHW power calculation. The periodic operation utilized the thermal mass of the building with the same effect in the case of light and heavy-weight building because of the very short cycle of 30 min. Room temperatures dropped during the DHW heating cycle but kept within comfort range. The developed equations predict the total power as a function of occupancy. peak and average DHW consumption with variations of 0%–2.2% compared to the simulated results. DHW heating added the total power in modern low energy buildings by 21%–41% and 13%–26% at design temperatures of− 15 C and− 26 C. respectively. Internal heat gains reduced the power so that the reduction effect compensated the effect of DHW heating in the case of a house occupied by three people.

Our study developed the monthly and hourly DHW usage profiles for Finnish apartment buildings based on onsite measured data. The average daily DHW usage was 43 L/(person. day) whereas the minimum and maximum were reported during July (37 L/(person. day)) and November (47 L/(person. day)). respectively. The daily usage mostly varied between 20-70 L/(person. day). Moreover. a specific selection procedure was used to develop the DHW hourly usage profiles for multiple occupant groups. These profiles had two sharp usage peaks in the morning and evening. DHW usage was 2-4 times higher during peak hours compared to non-peak hours. Also. usage peak at morning shifted 2-3 hours later during weekends (WE). whereas evening usage remained in the same period as on weekdays (WD). In addition. smaller occupant groups had higher DHW usages during peak hours than the larger groups. Furthermore. a bottom-up model was formulated to quantify the correlation of DHW usage patterns. which could predict the hourly usage of DHW for any unknown datasets. The developed equations can be used directly in simulation tools for estimating the DHW volume and corresponding energy use.

1307297,New Equation for Optimal Insulation Dependency on the Climate for Ofﬁce Buildings,2021,Kaiser Ahmed and Jarek Kurnitski,14,Energies,,,MDPI,The comparison of building energy efficiency in different climates is a growing issue. Unique structural solutions will not ensure the same energy use. but the differences also remain if cost-optimal solutions are applied. This study developed a new equation for the assessment of building envelope optimal insulation in different climates for office buildings. The developed method suggests determining actual degree days from simulated heating energy need and the thermal conductance of a building. avoiding in such a way the use of a base temperature. The method was tested in four climates and validated against cost-optimal solutions solved with optimization. The accuracy of the method was assessed with sensitivity analyses of key parameters such as window-to-wall ratios (WWRs). window g-values. costs of heating. and electricity. These results showed that the existing square root equation overestimated the climate difference effect so that the calculation from the cold climate U-value resulted in less insulation than cost-optimal in warmer climates. Parametric analyses revealed that the power value of 0.2 remarkably improved the accuracy as well as performance worked well in all cases and can be recommended as a default value. Sensitivity analyses with a broad range of energy costs and window parameters revealed that the developed equation resulted in maximum 5% underestimation and maximum 7% overestimation of an average area-weighted optimal U-value of building envelope in another climate. The developed method allows objectively to compare optimal insulation of the building envelope in different climates.

Requirement50 of IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSR Part3. Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards. places a responsibility on governments (ie national authorities) to “provide information on levels of radon indoors and the associated health risks and. if appropriate.... establish and implement an action plan for controlling public exposure due to radon indoors.” Since the publication of GSR Part3 in 2014. the IAEA has received many requests from Member States for advice on and assistance in establishing action plans to control exposure due to radon in dwellings. The first step in deciding whether an action plan is needed to control radon exposure of the public is to obtain information on radon concentrations and their distribution in the national housing stock. This is normally achieved by undertaking one or more radon surveys. As a basis for future decision making. it is important that such surveys be designed and conducted in a manner that is representative and free from bias. The purpose of this Safety Report is to provide States with practical guidance on designing and carrying out representative radon surveys as a basis for decisions regarding action plans to control exposure due to radon in dwellings. Before initiating such surveys. it is good practice to evaluate all available relevant information. as this can help inform decisions on the scope of such surveys and the areas where high radon concentrations are most likely to be found.

1307305,Modeling and simulation of series compensator to mitigate power quality problems,2010,S Sadaiappan and P Renuga and D Kavitha,2,International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology,12,7385-7394,,Power Electronics and Advanced Control technologies have made it possible to mitigate power quality problems and maintain the operation of sensitive loads. Among power system disturbances. voltage sags. swells and harmonics are some of the severe problems to the sensitive loads. The series compensation method is best suited to protect such loads against those disturbances. The use of a series compensator (SC) to improve power quality is an isolated power system is investigated. The role of the compensator is not only to mitigate the effects of voltage sag. but also to reduce the harmonic distortion due to the presence of non linear loads in the network. In this paper. a series compensator is proposed and a method of harmonic compensation is described and a method to mitigate voltage sag is investigated. The proposed series compensator consists of Energy Storage System (ESS) and Voltage Source Inverter (VSI). Injection Transformer. The ESS can be a capacitor of suitable capacity. ESS would act as a buffer and generally provides the energy needed for load ride-through during voltage sag. Injection Transformer is used to inject the voltage in transmission line in appropriate level. In this way the terminal voltage of the protected sensitive load can be regulated to maintain a constant level. The modeling and simulation of the proposed series compensator was implemented in Matlab Simulink work space. Simulation results showed that the proposed series compensator was efficient in mitigating voltage sags and harmonics and thus improve the power quality of the isolated power system.

New York. NY 10001. USA India,A new scheme of Multi Carrier Pulse Width Modulation (MCPWM) method for the control of a three-level inverter is proposed. Multi Carrier Pulse Width Modulation (MCPWM) works with a constant carrier frequency not synchronized with fundamental stator frequency. MCPWM gives an optimal utilization of switching frequency permitted. therefore PWM carrier frequency may be chosen to a value of two times the permitted switching frequency. Many applications of three-level inverters work with a dc-link neutral point not stabilized from the power input converter.

The capacitor placement approach involves the identification of location for capacitor placement and the size of the capacitor to be installed at the identified location. The location of the nodes where the capacitors should be placed is decided by a set of rules given by the Fuzzy Expert System (FES). Capacitor location problem is a highly nonlinear problem and hence FES method is chosen. Then the sizing of the capacitors is modeled as an optimization problem and the objective function (loss minimization) is solved using Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO) technique. A case study with an IEEE 34 bus distribution feeder is presented to illustrate the applicability of the algorithm. A comparison is made between the proposed HPSO approach and the classical Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in terms of convergence and economic savings achieved to study the performance of both the optimization algorithms.

FEDERICO II University 21 Claudio Naples I 80125 Italy,Optimization of total harmonic distortion(THD) and power factor subjected to power quality constraints for the evaluation of proposed Active power line conditioner(APLC) is carried out in this paper. Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is used to obtain the reference source current to optimize both power factor and THD. The proposed APLC is evaluated using conventional fixed frequency variable slope(FFVS) technique and neural network which is trained from the samples obtained using FFVS. Computer simulations of the proposed APLC have been performed using MATLAB and the results are encouraging. The results show that the proposed APLC can reduce the total harmonics distortion of a specific non linear load from 25% to about 2% and improve the power factor close to unity under nonsinusoidal conditions.,True,IUHwzg8AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,4,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17252926380501030120&hl=en&oi=scholarr,17252926380501030120,/scholar?cites=17252926380501030120,,,,0,0,0

Its developers claim that it can be used to access biological strategies for solving engineering problems. Our aim is to design a roof for hot climates that gets free cooling through radiant coupling with the sky. The insulation in a standard roof stops the sun and convection from warming the thermal mass. But it also restricts the mass's longwave view of the cool sky. Different solutions to this conflict are offered by BioTRIZ. The chosen solution is to replace the standard insulation component with an open cell honeycomb. The vertical cells would allow longwave radiation to pass. while arresting convection. The solutions offered by BioTRIZ's technological counterpart include no such changes in structure. It is estimated that the thermal mass in the biomimetic roof would remain on average 4.5°C cooler than in a standard roof over a year in Riyadh …,True,s4VBi6AAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,74,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672652908600074,17499879699893271519,/scholar?cites=17499879699893271519,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45536475/BioTRIZ_Suggests_Radiative_Cooling_of_Bu20160511-3458-1n9n2pf.pdf,0,0,0

1307338,Biomimetics design tool used to develop new components for lower-energy buildings,2008,Salmaan Craig,,,,,,The contributions to knowledge documented in this doctoral thesis are two-fold. The first contribution is in the application of a new biomimetic design tool called BioTRIZ. Its creators claim it can be used to facilitate the transfer of biological principles to solve engineering problems. The core case-study of this thesis documents how this tool was used to frame and systematically explore low-energy solutions to a key technical problem in the underdeveloped field of radiative cooling. Radiative cooling is a passive mechanism through which heat from a building can be rejected to the sky – an abundant but underused natural heat sink. Published in the Journal of Bionic Engineering. the study was the first independent application of BioTRIZ in the academic literature. The second contribution to knowledge is in the design. development and testing of the most promising biomimetic concept to come out of the BioTRIZ radiative cooling study. ‘Heat-selective’ insulation gives a roof mass a cool view of the sky because integrated pathways focus and channel longwave thermal radiation through it. It is biomimetic because it achieves infrared transparency by adding structural hierarchy to the component. rather than manipulating the properties of the material itself. Test panels on a rooftop in central London cooled to between 6 and 13 degrees below ambient temperature on May and April nights. Radiative cooling powers of between 25 and 70 W/m2 were measured when plates were at ambient temperature.

However. the capital cost of flow batteries has been a major barrier to commercialization of this technology. One attractive path to cost reduction is the development of flow-battery cells with substantially higher power densities than conventional flow-battery cells. The cost of the cells comprises a significant portion of the total flow-battery system cost. especially at low production volumes. since cell parts are custom-built components. UTRC has developed high power density vanadium-redox battery cells utilizing a material set similar to conventional cells.

That restricts generalization of the published results for the regions which are not covered with detailed research yet. The climate change impacts on the Russian power industry were for the first time quantified in a systematic way. A robust physically-based simulation approach was used to simulate a response of the steam and gas turbines performance to the climate warming. It was shown that an increase of the air temperature deteriorates performance of thermal and nuclear power plants across the whole Russia. The power drop of the steam turbines is about 0.2–0.3 and 0.4–0.6 percent per 1∘ C for thermal and nuclear power plants respectively. That means additional consumption of 3–4 million tce yearly to 2030–2050.

The adoption of such formulations implies that an additional effort must be made to describe the kinematic constraints that involve flexible bodies. The commercial multibody codes generally have good kincmatic joint libraries for rigid bodies. but they are limited in the type of joints available in what flexible bodies are concerned. This work proposes and demonstrates that such limitations can be overcome by using virtual rigid bodies. The idea is to develop a single kinematic joint that restricts all relative degrees of freedom between one or more nodes of the flcxible body and a rigid body.

The equations of motion for a partially flexible body composed of a rigid part and a flexible part are derived accounting for the inertial coupling between each component's gross motion and its elastodynamics.

This innovative heat pump is contemporary activated by both thermal and electric energy. ensuring more flexibility with respect to a traditional absorption heat pump and allowing to optimize the mix of energy vectors that feeds the system.

Of Microgen III, the 3rd International Conference in Microgeneration and Related Technologies in Buildings, April",,15-17,,The cogeneration is the combined production of electric and/or mechanical and thermal energy starting by a single energy source; in particular in this paper the analysis will be focused on a cogeneration system with electric power lower than 15 kW (micro-cogeneration). The paper analyzes a system consisting of a natural gasfired micro-cogeneration unit (MCHP). a heat storage and a peak boiler. The system provides thermal and electric energy to two end-users. the former is a tertiary building (office). where the generation system is located. and the latter is a residential building connected to the former through a district heating micro-grid. In order to analyze the influence of climatic conditions. two different geographical locations in Italy (Benevento and Milano) are considered. that are also characterized by different natural gas and electricity tariffs. Particular attention is paid to the choice of the users. in order to obtain more stable and continuous electric and thermal loads (load sharing approach) and to increase the operating hours per year of the MCHP unit.The operation of the MCHP is governed by a control system. aimed to optimize a thermoeconomic objective function. The models representing the components. the thermoeconomic objective function and the buildings have been implemented in a widely used commercial software for building simulations (TRNSYS).

The almost total dependence of these technologies from electricity causes summer peaks and supply difficulties.There are worldwide R&D aimed at identifying both thermally activated refrigeration technologies with high efficiency and new working fluids “environmental-friendly”. This paper focus on a compression/absorption refrigeration system (C-ARS) that uses ammonia-water as working pairs. The system is similar to a traditional absorption heat pump with a mechanical compression between the evaporator and the absorber pressure. This particular heat pump is activated by thermal and electric energy and ensures more flexibility and high potentiality to increase the global energy performance. for example interacting with a cogenerator. Furthermore it allows to optimize the mix of energy vectors. electricity and thermal energy. subjected to high daily and annual variability to reduce the operating costs. Finally this kind of absorption refrigerator can overcome some typical disadvantages of the traditional absorption heat pump. such as the restricted pressure and temperature lift.

1307447,FEDERICO II,,INGEGNERIA DEI SISTEMI MECCANICI,,,,,,Nella progettazione degli odierni motori a combustione interna (MCI) dedicati all’autotrazione. la sovralimentazione svolge un ruolo fondamentale non solo per il miglioramento delle prestazioni. ma anche per la riduzione dei consumi di combustibile e delle emissioni inquinanti sia per i motori ad accensione comandata che per quelli ad accensione per compressione. Nella letteratura corrente sono presenti numerosi contributi relativi alla sovralimentazione di MCI [1. 2]; questi si riferiscono a tecnologie avanzate quali turbocompressori a geometria variabile e multistadio. spesso integrati con sistemi di ricircolo dei gas di scarico (Exhaust Gas Recirculation-EGR) ad alta e/o bassa pressione. sovralimentazione assistita elettricamente e turbocompounding. Tali tecnologie si stanno affermando anche come strategie di controllo delle emissioni inquinanti e di riduzione dei consumi [3]. Per i MCI ad accensione per compressione. la sovralimentazione a gas di scarico ha consentito. ormai da più di cinquanta anni. di migliorarne sostanzialmente le prestazioni in termini di potenza erogata. In quelli di moderna concezione permette inoltre di mantenere adeguati valori di eccesso d’aria anche in presenza di elevati tassi di EGR [4]. Tale pratica. unitamente ad opportune strategie d’iniezione. rappresenta attualmente uno degli strumenti maggiormente impiegato per il contenimento delle emissioni inquinati.

We have fabricated SnS thin-film photoelectrodes by spin coating mixed-phase SnS nanocrystals synthesized via a hot-injection technique on glass/Cr/Au substrates. The obtained SnS thin films can be transformed into SnS 2 by introducing structural phase changes via a facile low-vacuum annealing protocol in the presence of sulfur. This sulfurization process enables the insertion of sulfur atoms between layers of SnS and results in the generation of shallow donors that alter the mechanism for water splitting. The SnS 2 thin films are used as stable photocatalysts to drive the oxygen evolution reaction. and the light-current density of 0.195 mA/cm 2 at 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl can be achieved due to the high carrier density. lower charge transfer resistance. and a suitable reaction band position. Based on a combination of UV-Vis spectroscopy (ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy). cyclic voltammetry and Mott–Schottky analysis. the band positions and band gaps of SnS and SnS 2 relative to the electrolyte are determined and a detailed mechanism for water splitting is presented.

Herein. we report on the development of an inexpensive and disposable immunosensor for the sensitive. specific. and label-free detection of HSA using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We have utilized a simple one-step screen-printing protocol to fabricate the carbon-based three-electrode system on flexible plastic substrates. To enable efficient antibody immobilization and improved sensitivity. the carbon working electrode was sequentially modified with electropolymerized polyaniline (PANI) and electrodeposited gold nanocrystals (AuNCs). The PANI matrix serves as an interconnected nanostructured scaffold for homogeneous distribution of AuNCs and the resulting PANI/AuNCs nanocomposite synergically improved the immunosensor response. The PANI/AuNCs-modified working electrode surface was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the electrochemical response at each step was analyzed using EIS in a ferri/ferrocyanide redox probe solution. The normalized impedance variation during immunosensing increased linearly with HSA concentration in the range of 3–300 µg/mL and a highly repeatable response was observed for each concentration.

Tafel slope= 60 mV/dec. onset potential=− 80 mV) of atmospheric air plasma treated (AAPT) SnS thin films by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The as prepared SnS films were subjected to Atmospheric Air Plasma Treatment (AAPT) which leads to formation of additional phases of Sn and SnO 2 at plasma powers of 150 W and 250 W. respectively. The AAPT treatment at 150 W leads to the evaporation of the S atoms as SO 2 generates a number of S-vacancies and Sn active edge sites over the surface of the SnS thin film. S-vacancies also create Sn active edge sites. surface p-type pinning that tunes the suitable band positions. and a hydrophilic surface which is beneficial for hydrogen adsorption/desorption. At high plasma power (250 W). the surface of the SnS films becomes oxidized and degrades the HER performance. These results demonstrate that AAPT (150 W) is capable of improving the HER performance of SnS thin films and our results indicate that SnS thin films can work as efficient electrocatalysts for HER.

The PCM is located behind the five sides of the evaporator cabinet in which the evaporator coil is immersed. The refrigeration system has been tested with three different PCMs (Water. Eutectic solution-1. and Eutectic solution-2 of melting point 0 C.-5 C. and-10 C. respectively) at different thermal loads. Experimental results show that the evaporating temperature of the refrigeration cycle with PCM is considerably higher than that of without PCM.

Thermal Eng,,,,Single-phase pressure drop of eight helical microfin tubes with different fin dimensions have been measured experimentally with the aim of developing a generalized correlation of single-phase friction factor for helical microfin tubes. Water has been used as working fluid and the Reynolds number has been varied from 2× 103 to 1× 105. The experimental results show that higher helix angle. higher augmentation ratio and higher fin height to average inner diameter ratio cause more friction loss inside helical microfin tubes. The friction losses of helical tubes are around 1.05 to 2.2 times higher than that of a smooth tube depending on the fin geometric parameters and mass velocity of the working fluid.

This is the intrinsic criterion for causal laws we propose. A process is a space-time line along which some properties are conserved or vary. A process law contains a time variable. but only process laws that contain a time derivative are causal laws. An effect is identified with what corresponds to a time derivative of some property or magnitude in a process law. whereas the other terms correspond to the cause(s). According to our criterion. causes are simultaneous with their effects and causality has no temporal direction. Several examples from natural and social disciplines support the applicability of our criterion to all scientific laws. Various objections to our proposal are presented and refuted.

However. their rather low electric efficiency limits their profitability when the heat demand decreases. Hot liquid water injection in mGTs –particularly within the micro Humid Air Turbine (mHAT) cycle– allows increasing electric efficiency by making use of the flue gas residual heat in moments of low heat demand.Based on simulations performed on a Turbec T100 mGT –modified to operate as an mHAT– installed at the VUB. this paper presents an analysis of the economic profitability of such facility running on real network conditions.

A WESP is shown to be very efficient for the removal of nuclei from the flue gas (100% efficient) and thus can prevent aerosol formation inside an amine based absorber. This is however only valid in the absence of SO2 in the flue gas entering the WESP. A decreasing WESP efficiency is noted in the presence of SO2 with increasing voltages as a result of newly formed aerosols inside the WESP. This implies that no or very low levels of SO2 should be present in the flue gas entering the WESP. Since most of the amine carbon capture installations have a pre-scrubber (usually using NaOH to remove residual SO2 in the flue gas leaving the power plant's Flue Gas Desulphurisation) in front of their amine absorber. the WESP must be installed behind this pre-scrubber and not in …,True,i_PcRvwAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610217314200,2443966336889115110,/scholar?cites=2443966336889115110,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610217314200/pdf?md5=999ff0f1f2a91bcf82f4f6f35f1239de&pid=1-s2.0-S1876610217314200-main.pdf&_valck=1,0,0,0
1307515,Investigation of pulverised biomass combustion: detailed modelling of particle pyrolysis and experimental analysis of ash deposition,2013,Julien Blondeau,,,,,,Biomass is generally defined as the material originating from recently living organisms. ie mainly wood. plants. agricultural residues. and animals1. The notion of recently living organisms could also be more accurately circumscribed by the concept of biodegradable materials used in some definitions of biomass [1. 2].When those materials can be used as fuels2. it makes them renewable sources of energy. among others. like wind. or solar radiation. from which any source of energy on earth ultimately originates. The word renewable itself however needs clarification. It should indeed be understood as renewable or infinite at the human time scale. in order to explicitly exclude fossil fuels. that were produced from biomass in finite amounts in earth history. in very specific conditions and over long periods of time. but might still be produced in the far future. and to include solar radiation. that is not strictly renewable. but without which humanity could not survive anyway.

The detailed air flow distribution to the burners can also be unknown depending on the available measurements. An accurate control of local and global air-fuel ratios is however crucial in terms of boiler efficiency and various pollutant emission reductions. leading to lower overall operational cost. improved performance and increased fuel and load flexibility.

1307518,Biomass combustion in pulverized-fuel boilers: use of apparent pyrolysis parameters in CFD codes,2011,Julien Blondeau and Hervé Jeanmart and Yves Ryckmans and Patrick Allard and David Rochaya,,,,,,Biomass combustion or co-combustion in pulverized-fuel boilers (pf-boilers) has become an attractive way to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes used for design or diagnostic purposes are most of the time inherited from the study of coal-fired pf-boilers. Due to the fundamental differences between coal and biomass combustions. such tools need to be adapted. As pyrolysis accounts for the major mass and energy releases during biomass combustion in pf-boilers. the present work focuses on this step. In order to relax the particles’ isothermicity assumption commonly used in CFD codes. that has been proven to be questionnable for biomass applications. a detailed pyrolysis kinetic scheme has been coupled to a physical model of a single biomass particle. In previous works. apparent kinetic parameters have been derived from this detailed single particle model. The use of these apparent parameters in existing CFD codes requires nomodification of the code structure nor any increase of the computational time. It allows for the consideration of particle internal heat transfer effects. This modifies the gaseous products emission rate from the particles. The influence of the proposed apparent parameters has been tested on a complete CFD simulation. The main results are presented here. A large impact on the resulting flame temperature has been observed. together with a modification of the predicted CO and NOx emissions. Comparison with onsite measurements shows that the proposed parameters improve the prediction capability of the code.

More specifically. the experimental characterization of the size of the emitted particles. i.e. using impactors. is still subject to discussions about the impact of the methodology on the measurement results. To meet with these challenges. particulate emissions from a medium-scale biomass boiler (4.5 MWth) were measured with Electrical Low Pressure Impactors (ELPI+) using two different dilution systems to examine the effect of dilution and performance of the ELPI+. For both the two stage dilution systems and one stage dilution system. no statistically significant correlation was found between the dilution ratio (DR) and particle total number concentration Ntot or between DR and mass concentration mtot. However. with both dilution system. a significant positive correlation was observed between DR and particles with diameter Dp < 0.01 µm due to measurement artefacts. With the one stage dilution system dilution systems. condensation appears to be promoted with reduced DR. When the ELPI+ impactor is not overloaded. the number concentration of fractions N< 0.01 and N0.01-0.1 reduce over time due to prematurely measuring particles. When the impactor is overloaded. N< 0.01 is overestimated and N0.01-0.1 and N0.1-1 are underestimated due to a change in cut-off diameter.,True,i_PcRvwAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,3,https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-19-10-oa-0487,1737434711730640681,/scholar?cites=1737434711730640681,,,https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-19-10-oa-0487,0,0,0

Flue Gas Condensers (FGCs) are still not widely spread in biomass combustion plants. Although their costs have significantly decreased during the last decade. the economic viability of FGC retrofits is not straightforward and their return on investments is mainly dependent on the temperature of the available heat sink and the moisture content of the fuel. Based on a new techno-economic model of a FGC validated with recent industrial data. this paper presents a methodology to assess the economic viability of an FGC retrofitting in a medium-scale biomass combustion plant. The proposed methodology is applied to the case of a typical District Heating plant for which real data was collected. For the first time. the usual assumptions of constant process data generally used are challenged by considering the variability of the return temperature and heat demand over the year. Furthermore. a new concept of optimal configurations in terms of energy savings is introduced in this paper and compared to a strictly economic optimum. The economic feasibility is mainly evaluated by means of the Net Present Value (NPV). Discounted Payback Period (DPP). and the Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR). As expected. results show that the higher the humidity level and the lower the return temperature. the higher the economic profitability of a project. The NPV is. however. increased when considering variable inputs: Even with an average return temperature of 60 C. a mixed operation of the FGC as a condenser and an economizer along the year is …,True,i_PcRvwAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,2,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/12/2337,17376652497109117068,/scholar?cites=17376652497109117068,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/12/2337/pdf,0,0,0

The ability to track the rotational speed of a system is a critical requirement for the majority of vibration-based condition monitoring methods. Information about the speed enables compensating for potential speed variations that would otherwise impair conventional frequency-based methods. The problem of instantaneous speed estimation based on the vibration signals themselves is one that has received a significant amount of attention in recent years. Installing encoders or tachometers has become a lot less attractive due to the potential cost savings that can be obtained by simply utilizing an accelerometer instead.

Some of these microgrids. including U.S. Military Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). use diesel generators as the primary or sole resource. In almost all cases. efficient utilization of generation resources is a high priority. This is particularly so for FOBs. for which diesel fuel resupplies come at remarkable monetary. logistical. and safety costs. Increasing the fuel efficiency of such microgrids requires not only incremental improvements to generation and load services. but also a higher-level understanding of how these components interact.

1307550,Controlling the input impedance of constant power loads,2018,Manuel Gutierrez and Peter Lindahl and Arijit Banerjee and Steven B Leeb,,,,3452-3458,IEEE,Power electronic circuits often regulate load power and present a constant power load (CPL) to the utility or other electrical source. Because CPLs exhibit a negative incremental input impedance. they pose stability concerns in both DC and AC systems. This paper presents a power converter for a constant power LED lighting load that mitigates these stability concerns by presenting a controllable input impedance to the electrical source. The use of an energy buffer allows the converter to control input power to resemble a resistive load over short times. while still delivering constant output power. Experimental results demonstrate that the converter exhibits a resistive input impedance at frequencies over 0.5 Hz while maintaining constant power to the LED load.,True,GhnJnuQAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,2,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8341600/,12820182556874519263,/scholar?cites=12820182556874519263,,,,0,0,0

Takemura and Dirk R. Englund and Jaime Goldstein,,,,,ASEE Conferences,Communication skills are critical to engineers’ success in both academia and industry. Nevertheless. a variety of factors keep engineering students from developing those skills while in school. leading to a skills gap between recent graduates’ actual preparation and their expected performance. This gap can be especially pronounced with graduate students. yet relatively little research and innovation has targeted this key population. Here we present two initiatives to improve the communication skills of graduate students: a department-level “Communication Lab” using peer tutors. and a for-credit communication course. Each approach is analyzed for pedagogical advantages. resource intensiveness. and general utility to the department. We conclude that the Communication Lab model is an overall effective resource for reaching a large number of students in a way that is cost-effective per-student. pedagogically advantageous. and an efficient use of student time.

Mohamed,7,Port-Said Engineering Research Journal,1,102-114,Faculty of Engineering.

This prediction study requires obtaining the solution of a set of three simultaneous partial differential equations. that express the temperature distribution in the fluid. receiver and glass cover along the collector flow passage. The explicitimplicit finite difference technique (with a weighting factor of 0.5. Crank-Nicklson) was used to solve the basic governing equations of the system components. The results obtained from the model was compared with two series of experimental results for different water mass flow rates. Numerical and experimental results were compared and good agreement was found. with a maximum deviation not exceeding than 7%. The model was also used to show the effect of the different geometrical and operating conditions on the collector efficiency and the temperature rise through the collector. The results showed that the collector efficiency can be increased by increasing the mass flow rate through the collector and in the contrary the temperature rise of the working fluid through the collector decreased by increasing the working fluid mass flow rate. The results also showed that the increase of the viscosity of the working fluid increased the temperature rise through the collector and decreased the collector thermal efficiency.

The present study investigates the use of different designs of variable porosity wind fences on the velocity field behind the fence. Two segments and three segments fences were tested and compared with the 30% constant porosity wind fence. Average Navier-Stocks equations describing air flow field enclosed with the RNG k-ε turbulence model were dedicated for the present simulation. Numerical simulation model based on finite volume technique was employed. PHOENICS 2006 CFD solver is used for the numerical solution of the simulation model.

Suez Canal University,Heat transfer enhancement and pressure drop penalty in tube side and annuli side of a double-tube heat exchanger with spirally fluted inner tube were evaluated for the laminar flow regime. Six different fluted tubes were tested. The experiments covered a range of Reynolds numbers 500 Re 2.000 and for the Prandtl number range 2.5 Pr 6.7. All the data were obtained using hot water flowing in the tube side and cold water flowing in the annuli side of the heat exchanger. The dependence of heat transfer and friction factor enhancements on geometric and flow variables was used to develop guidelines for the optimum range of applicability of spirally fluted inner tube in the double tube heat exchanger. The annuli-side heat transfer enhancements relative to the smooth-tube annuli are typically between 3 to 6. while that for the tube side are between 1.5 to 3.5 times the smooth tube values. The corresponding friction factor augmentations are between 1.5 to 2.2 in annuli side and between 1.8 to 3.7 in tube side. The heat transfer enhancement and the pressure drop penalty increase with decreasing flute pitch and Re number and with increasing flute depth. The fluted inner tube causes enhancements in heat transfer up to 3.2 times the corresponding augmentation in friction factor in the annuli side and 1.4 times the corresponding augmentation in the friction factor in tube side of the heat exchanger. The results of the correlations obtained were compared with the published results of previous investigators.Nomenclature A cross-sectional area m mass flow rate Cp specific heat of the fluid Nu average Nusselt number De. a equivalent diameter of annuli …,True,1AS34C4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayman_Mohamed/publication/260595008_Investigation_of_Heat_Transfer_and_Pressure_Drop_for_Double_Tube_Heat_Exchanger_with_fluted_surface/links/00b7d531b13317c08f000000.pdf,6647364033957990641,/scholar?cites=6647364033957990641,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayman_Mohamed/publication/260595008_Investigation_of_Heat_Transfer_and_Pressure_Drop_for_Double_Tube_Heat_Exchanger_with_fluted_surface/links/00b7d531b13317c08f000000.pdf,0,0,0

The influence of working fluid flowrate on a 500W ORC system was investigated. Adjusting the working fluid flowrate to an optimal value results in the most efficient heat transfer and hence the optimal heat transfer parameters of the plate heat exchanger can be determined. Therefore. for the ORC systems. optimal working fluid flowrate should be controlled. Using different temperature hot water as the heat source. it is found that the optimal flowrate increases by 6-10 L/h with 5 °C increment of hot water inlet temperature.

The gaseous acid treatment also leads to a remarkable increase of the specific as well as effective surface area through the formation of a highly porous graphite structure from dense graphite filamentous. The as-synthesized catalyst was further used as a metal-free catalyst in the selective oxidation of H 2 S in industrial waste effluents. According to the results. the defects decorated with oxygenated groups were highly active for performing selective oxidation of H 2 S into elemental sulfur. The desulfurization activity was relatively high and extremely stable as a function of time on stream which indicated the high efficiency of these oxidized un-doped GFs as metal-free catalysts for the selective oxidation process. The high catalytic performance was attributed to both the presence of structural defects on the filamentous carbon wall. which acting as a dissociative adsorption center for the oxygen. and the oxygenated functional groups. which could play the role of active sites for the selective oxidation process.

Among them. they have drawn attention as highly valuable and durable catalysts for the selective hydrogen sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur in the treatment of natural gas. In this contribution. we report the outstanding performance of NC/SiC based composites obtained by the surface coating of a non-oxide ceramic with a mesoporous N-doped carbon phase. starting from commercially available and cheap food-grade components. Our study points out on the importance of controlling the chemical and morphological properties of the NC phase to get more effective and robust catalysts suitable to operate H 2 S removal from sour (acid) gases under severe desulfurization conditions (high GHSVs and concentrations of aromatics as sour gas stream contaminants). We firstly discuss the optimization of the SiC impregnation/thermal treatment sequences for the NC phase growth as well as on the role of aromatic contaminants in concentrations as high as 4 vol.% on the catalyst performance and its stability on run. A long-term desulfurization process (up to 720 h). in the presence of intermittent toluene rates (as aromatic contaminant) and variable operative temperatures. has been used to validate the excellent performance of our optimized NC 2/SiC catalyst as well as to rationalize its unique stability and coke-resistance on run.

This process has led to increased wage inequality. discrimination as well as the concern of job insecurity in the labour market. We focus on the wage inequality between permanent and contract workers. since contract workers earn substantially lower wages than their counterpart. The study uses data at the individual level from a recent labour survey of organised manufacturing industries in India. The lower wage earned by contract worker is largely due to cost cutting. rather than differences in labour productivity. The issue of job insecurity has been modeled in form of a binary logistic model. The factors affecting job security are divided as productivity related attributes like level of education. skill etc. and institutional attributes such as labour market rules and regulations. union membership etc. Contrary to the general expectation the study finds that permanent workers are more concern of job insecurity than contract workers.,True,pQeRRs4AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,64,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=900362,15434001775711032331,/scholar?cites=15434001775711032331,,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/33419/1/510931928.pdf,0,0,0

In addition the technological innovation also provides impetus to the progressive integration of the nations. The elements of globalization include free movement of goods and services. flow of capital. movement of labor and the transfer of technology. Many transition and developing countries through liberalization and increased openness to trade have benefited from the process. Apart from the economic benefits. globalization also indicates the flow of ideas. norms. information and peoples. There is a large heterogeneity in the degree of globalization over time and across countries and regions of the World. as well as within countries. The present study is an attempt to measure globalization by using both parametric and non-parametric approaches. The data cover a wide range of industrialized. transition and developing countries on the basis of their international integration.

The standalone SPV home lighting system has increasingly been popular among rural households. while SPV mini-grid supply system is being promoted for rural electrification schemes. This study uses data from household survey to explore the impact of household characteristics on the preference for electrical energy from SPV systems.

1307635,Access to banking services and poverty reduction: a state-wise assessment in India,2009,Amit K Bhandari,,,4132,,IZA Discussion Paper,Financial inclusion is the broad based delivery of banking and other financial services at affordable cost to the poorest sections of society. In India. financial inclusion emphasizes to include maximum number of people under formal financial systems. The most important part of financial services in a region is typically measured by number of people who have access to bank accounts. The present study investigates the drive to financial inclusion in the form of the growth in bank accounts of scheduled commercial banks and the changes in below poverty line population. The result suggests that the growth in bank accounts is not significantly associated with the reduction in below poverty line population across states. Providing banking services to maximum number of people is unsuccessful as a poverty reduction strategy.

Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) working at grass-root level. having direct contact with the rural people and meet their financial requirements. The problem of loan overdue is a serious concern in different regions of the country. as it affects the recycling of funds and loses its economic viability as a lending institution.

It is such a wonderful legume that it can excel even under adverse soil conditions; acidic or saline alkaline (pH 4.5 to 9.0). In favourable conditions. it gives very high yields. but low yield may result from biotic and abiotic stress. In India. it is still treated as minor legume.

Agriculture contributes $400 billion to the Indian economy. which is 2 nd after China. To achieve this mammoth national target. all sectors of economy viz.. agriculture. industry and service have to outperform outstanding. To achieve this target. our total export should be of $1.0 trillion annually and share of agriculture and the allied sector should be 10%. To achieve $100 million agri-export. smart agriculture is pivotal to sustain our products at the international level. Agritech startup can play a vital role in this endeavour; however. the bottleneck should be removed within the least possible time. If we succeed in this endeavour. this will not only lead to enhance per capita income from the current $1800 to $3600 but also double the income from farming systematically. Unfortunately. due to the worldwide attack of a global pandemic of COVID-2019 disease. every sphere of life has been severely paralysed. The agriculture sector was less affected as the food grain output was recorded highest ever (295.67 MT) and sector growth 3.7% in absolute term and 11.3% on the current price. during 2019-20. India will get rid off of such disasters relatively faster as compared to other nations. but this has the potential to push forward our economic dream to beam reality at least for a year or so.

These agro-residue and biomass are not waste but the resources and can be utilized by meeting the challenge of soil degradation. environmental pollution and energy security. The present paper put light on the potential of the biochar as an agent for mitigating climate change and improving soil health. The biochar has higher calorific value than the raw biomass and is stabilized carbon. Design improvement of cook stove and portable biochar kiln would help in biomass conservation. efficient utilization of biomass as energy source. reduction in greenhouse gases (especially CO2) emission. black carbon reduction which is responsible for global warming.

A meta-analysis of 51 selected studies is performed to evaluate ARGs abundance trends over the last 7 years. WaferGen TM SmartChip is found to be the most widely used HT-qPCR platform among others for evaluating ARGs. Up till now around 1000 environmental samples (excluding biological replicates) from different parts of the world have been analyzed on HT-qPCR. Calculated detection frequency and normalized ARGs abundance (ARGs/16S rRNA gene) reported in gut microbiome studies have shown a trend of low ARGs as compared to other environmental matrices. Disparities in the HT-qPCR data analysis which are causing difficulties to researchers in precise interpretation of results have been highlighted and a possible way forward for resolving them is also suggested. The potential of other amplification technologies and point of care or field deployable devices for analyzing ARGs have also been discussed in the review.

Despite the higher stability of biogenic nanoparticles there is still need to optimize the synthesis rate and other factors affecting the synthesis process. Microbial synthesis of silver. gold. platinum. titania. zirconia. magnetite nanoparticles and quantum dots has been described successfully. However molecular mechanisms that mediates the synthesis of nanoparticles should be elucidated further to improve the properties of nanoscale materials and production rate. Due to the rich biodiversity of microbes. their potential as a useful source for the production of nanoparticle is yet to be fully explored.

Existing P removal practice in freshwaters is limited due to the lack of assessment of the possibility and feasibility of controlling P level towards a very low level (such as 10 μg/L) in order to prevent the harmful algal blooms. In this study. a combined external and internal P control approach was evaluated in a simulated pilot-scale river–lake system. In total. 0.8 m 3 of simulated river water was continuously supplied to be initially treated by a P adsorption column filled with a granulated lanthanum/aluminium hydroxide composite (LAH) P adsorbent. At the outlet of the column (ie. inlet of the receiving tanks). the P concentration decreased from 230 to 20 µg/L at a flow rate of 57 L/day with a hydraulic loading rate of 45 m/day. In the receiving tanks (simulated lake). 90 g of the same adsorbent material was added into 1 m 3 water for further in situ treatment. which reduced and maintained the P concentration at 10 µg/L for 5 days. The synergy of external and internal P recapture was demonstrated to be an effective strategy for maintaining the P concentration below 10 µg/L under low levels of P water input. The P removal was not significantly affected by temperature (5–30 C). and the treatment did not substantially alter the water pH. Along with the superior P adsorption capacity. less usage of LAH could lead to reduced cost for potation eutrophication control compared with other widely used P adsorbents.

However. we have demonstrated that typical algae-blooming species Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) combined with photocatalysts could synergistically facilitate the photodecontamination of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) and Cr (VI). In this study. for the first time. harmful algae were successfully converted into photoreactive bionano hybrid materials by immobilizing M. aeruginosa cells onto polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-TiO 2/Ag hybrid nanofibers. and their photocatalytic activity was evaluated. The addition of M. aeruginosa significantly improved the photodecontamination. and the reaction rate constant (k) values of TC and Cr (VI) degradation by M. aeruginosa-PAN/TiO 2/Ag nanofiber mats were 2.4 and 1.5-fold higher than that of bare PAN/TiO 2/Ag nanofiber. Photoreaction caused damage to algae cells. but no microcystin was found that had been photodegraded simultaneously. The effects of various active species were also investigated. and the photodegradation mechanism was proposed. Recycling tests revealed that this flexible M. aeruginosa-PAN/TiO 2/Ag hybrid mat had potential application in the removal of mixed organic and inorganic pollutants with high efficiency and without secondary pollutants. Thus. harmful algae blooms could serve as an efficient materials to remove toxic pollutants in a sustainable way under visible light irradiation.

To evaluate the role of small scale poultry slaughterhouses in resistance dissemination in Pakistan. a comparative genomic analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the gut microbiome of broiler and household chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) was performed. An array of 52 qPCR primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene. ARGs and MGEs was used in the experiment to analyse the abundance of selected genes in collected samples. A total of 22 ARGs and 7 MGEs were detected in all samples. The detection frequency of specific gene classes and diversity of genes was found to be higher in broiler as compared to household chicken. Sul1 was the most abundant ARG with the highest percent relative abundance (2.4%). Total percent relative abundance of ARGs in broiler chicken was found to be significantly (p< 0.05) greater than household chicken fecal samples. A significant linear correlation (R2= 0.89) was found between relative abundances of int1 and total ARGs.

Our study investigates this issue in the context of Portugal using monthly funds' portfolio-holdings and documents evidence suggesting the significant temporal dependence of monthly institutional demand which is for the most part due to herding. The significance of this dependence remains robust when controlling for several styles. as well as accounting for the entry of Portugal into the EURONEXT and the outbreak of the ongoing global crisis.

1307768,Essays on Collective Investor's Behavior,2013,Konstantinos Gavriilidis,,,,,,The 1980s has given rise to a new area of Finance. namely Behavioral Finance. which challenged the so far dominance of the Neoclassical Finance. Particularly. this new area introduced concepts from cognitive psychology in order to explain investors’ behavior at the collective level. Two of the most known faucets of collective investors’ behavior are herding and feedback trading. The first one is the phenomenon where investors copy the actions of the other investors. often disregarding their own beliefs. whereas the second one involves the chase of trends on behalf of the investors. Our thesis first examines the relationship between style investing and institutional herding under the context of a concentrated market. Style investing has been found to promote herding in numerous studies; however. given that these studies have been carried out in large markets. there has not been examined what is the impact of market concentration over this relationship. as a concentrated market may produce different trading dynamics than those in large markets. What is next is to examine the impact of the introduction of the Exchanged Traded Funds over noise trading; these relatively new financial products have special characteristics that can make them appealing to the investors and they could positively contribute towards markets’ completion.

The impact of growing conditions on the properties of biodiesel produced from FWM-CV was evaluated. The properties of FWM-CV biodiesel were found to be within the ASTM standards for biodiesel. Due to the limited amount of biodiesel produced on the lab-scale. the biomass of dry cells of FWM-CV was used to yield emulsified water fuel. The preparation of emulsion fuel with and without FWM-CV cells was conducted using ultrasound to overcome the problems of large size microalgae colonies and to form homogenized emulsions. The emulsified water fuels. prepared using ultrasound. were found to be stable and the size of FWM-CV colonies were effectively reduced to pass through the engine nozzle safely. Engine tests at 3670 rpm were conducted using three fuels: cottonseed biodiesel CS-B100. emulsified cottonseed biodiesel water fuel. water and emulsifier (CS-E20) and emulsified water containing FWM-CV cells CS-ME20. The results showed that the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was increased by about 41% when the engine was fueled with emulsified water fuels compared to CS-B100. The engine power. exhaust gas temperature. NO x and CO 2 were significantly lower than that produced by CS-B100. The CS-ME20 produced higher power than CS-E20 due to the heating value improvement as a result of adding FWM-CV cells to the fuel.

The options for utilising cotton biomass wastes include composting. gasification. pyrolysis. fermentation (ethanol). anaerobic digestion and direct incineration. Solid cotton gin waste cannot be directly reused on-farm due to farm hygiene risks.

1307778,Chlorella protothecoides microalgae as an alternative fuel for tractor diesel engines,2013,Saddam H Al-Lwayzy and Talal Yusaf,6,Energies,2,766-783,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Biodiesel has attracted a great deal attention recently as an alternative fuel due to increasing fuel prices and the imperative to reduce emissions. Among a wide range of biodiesel resources. microalgae are a promising alternative fuel source because of the high biomass. lipid productivity and environmentally friendliness. Microalgae is also a non-edible food. therefore. there will be no impact on the human food supply chain. In this work. petroleum diesel (PD) and biodiesel from the microalgae Chlorella protothecoides (MCP-B20) blend have been used to examine the performance and the emission of a 25.8 kW agriculture tractor engine. Two engine speeds at maximum power take off (PTO) power and torque have been selected for analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that there is no significant difference between the engine performance when microalgae biodiesel blend (MCP-B20) and PD were used. However. a significant reduction in CO. CO 2 and NO emissions was found when MCP-B20 was used. These outcomes give strong indication that microalgae can be successfully used in tractors as alternative fuel.

BA can produce via fermentation from biomass (agricultural waste and residues) that is non-edible. The benefits of butanol have been supported by many studies as additive fuel for conventional diesel due to its exceptional fuel properties such as high burning velocity and heating value. However. the cost of butanol production is the main issue of using it as a fuel because of high recovery and production costs. It is cheaper to produce BA than butanol because it is not necessary to separate the butanol from other chemicals in the biofuel.

Ethanol has lower density. viscosity. cetane number and calorific value than petroleum diesel (PD). Microalgae oil is renewable. environmentally friendly and has the potential to replace PD. In this paper. microalgae oil (10%) and ethanol (10%) have been mixed and added to (80%) diesel fuel as a renewable source of oxygenated fuel. The mixture of microalgae oil. ethanol and petroleum diesel (MOE20%) has been found to be homogenous and stable without using surfactant. The presence of microalgae oil improved the ethanol fuel demerits such as low density and viscosity. The transesterification process was not required for oil viscosity reduction due to the presence of ethanol. The MOE20% fuel has been tested in a variable compression ratio diesel engine at different speed. The engine test results with MOE20% showed a very comparable engine performance of in-cylinder pressure. brake power. torque and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) to that of PD. The NO x emission and HC have been improved while CO and CO 2 were found to be lower than those from PD at low engine speed.

1307790,Microalgae biofuels for diesel engines in agricultural applications,2014,Saddam H Al-lwayzy,,,,,,Diesel engines are the key components of several sectors in modern life. The dramatic growth of the world’s population. economy and industry has increased the demand for petroleum diesel (PD) fuel. The increased use of depleting PD in recent years has highlighted the problems of high fuel prices and emissions. The emissions from combusting PD have been proven to affect human health and to contribute to the high carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that have led to global warming.  Alternative fuels have become essential for eliminating the PD problems. Biodiesel has attracted much attention as a renewable and environmentally friendly alternative fuel. The main drawback of using biodiesel as a fuel alternative to PD is the limited resources available. which cannot satisfy the demand for PD. Using vegetable oil for biodiesel purposes could create a food crisis. Potentially. microalgae are a promising alternative because of their high biomass and lipid productivity. and because they can contribute to reducing CO2 pollution through the photosynthesis process. Microalgae have the ability to grow in a variety of difficult conditions such as in seawater. wastewater or deserts. thus avoiding influence on the agriculture sector.

The conservation laws are applied to finite control volumes and an implicit formulation is used for transient numerical solutions. Conjugate forced convection heat transfer from the tube is solved to calculate the temperatures of the air and water coming out of the heat exchanger.

In many practical thermal systems. it is important that the dynamics of these components in response to changes in other conditions be understood. The controlled variable is usually the exit temperature of one of the fluids in response to disturbances in the inlet conditions. An example of this is a building cooling or heating system where long ducts and water-to-air cross-flow heat exchangers are commonly used. It may then be desired that. in response to arbitrary changes in one or more of the inlet conditions. the discharge air temperature from any one of the heat exchangers be kept constant by manipulating the flow rate of the water. In order to properly predict the behavior of the control system. it is important that the dynamics of these components in response to these changes in input conditions be understood and calculable. This is difficult due to the distributed and nonlinear nature of these systems.

1307809,Exergy analysis of directional solvent extraction desalination process,2019,Sorour Alotaibi and Osama M Ibrahim and Yu Wang and Tengfei Luo,21,Entropy,3,321,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper presents an exergy analysis to evaluate the performance of a continuous directional solvent extraction (DSE) desalination process using octanoic acid. The flow of exergy was calculated for each thermodynamic state and balanced for different components of the system to quantify the inefficiencies in the process. A parametric study was performed to evaluate the impact of three critical design variables on exergy consumption. The parametric study reveals that the total exergy input decreases significantly with an increase in heat exchanger effectiveness. The results also indicate that the heat exchangers account for the highest exergy destruction. The total exergy consumption. however. has a slightly declining trend as the recovery-ratio increases. There is a small variation in the total exergy consumption. within the uncertainty of the calculation. as the highest process temperature increases. When compared to conventional desalination processes. the exergy consumption of the DSE. with heat recovery of 90%. is comparable to those of multi-stage flashing (MSF). but much higher than reverse osmosis (RO). Octanoic acid. which has low product water yield. is identified as the primary factor negatively impacting the exergy consumptions. To exploit the low-grade and low-temperature heat source feature of the DSE process. directional solvents with higher yield should be identified or designed to enable its full implementation.

The aim of this work is to optimize the geometry of a tube with internal flow of water and an external cross-flow of air. based on its controllability characteristics. Controllability is a useful concept both from theoretical and practical perspective since it tells us if a particular output can be controlled by a particular input. This concept can also provide us with information about the easiest operating condition to control a particular output. A transient model of a tube in cross-flow is developed. where an implicit formulation is used for transient numerical solutions. The aspect ratio of the tube is optimized. subject to volume constraints. based on the optimum operation in terms of controllability. The reported optimized aspect ratio. water mass flow rate and controllability are studied for deferent external properties of the tube.,True,vrN3ktQAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?ID=0354-98360803075A,3945645910836743227,/scholar?cites=3945645910836743227,,,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0354-98360803075A,0,0,0
1307821,Experimental modeling of refrigerants at high ambient temperature,2021,Sorour Alotaibi and Sahar Ajrawi,9,Journal of Engineering Research,1,,,High ambient temperature is well known to have an adverse impact on air conditioners; it lowers their cooling capacity along with their coefficient of performance. Moreover. air conditioning plays a significant role in damaging the environment as it contributes to both global warming and ozone depletion. In the past few decades. the Montreal agreement was introduced to protect the ozone layer from substances that contribute to its depletion. Developing countries are now facing the challenges of phasing out HCFCs such as R22 in the air conditioning sector. The aim of this study is to find an alternative refrigerant that can replace R22 after its phase out. The new refrigerant must have low environmental impacts and should be able to withstand operation in high ambient temperature countries. In this study. the hydrocarbon refrigerant R290 and the hydrofluorocarbon R410A were selected as alternatives. Furthermore. experimental testing was carried out on the baseline refrigerant R22 and R410A using a 7kW ducted split unit at three outdoor conditions: 35 o C. 48 o C. and 52 o C. From the experimental results. a model based on R22 and R410A was developed using Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The model was successful in verifying the experimental results within a 15% error range. and was tested again with external data from (Eltalouny & Nielsen. 2016)[10]. After confirming its validity. the model was simulated to predict the performance of the alternative refrigerant R290 under the same experimental conditions and input data. To test the model’s validity on R290. results from (Eltalouny & Nielsen. 2016) were used.

Salah and Dahaman Ishak and Amir Abu_Al_Aish and Basem Abu Zneid and Anees Abu Sneineh,9,Journal of Engineering Science and Technology (JESTEC),6,670-799,Taylor’s University,This paper presents the development of the commutation time estimator (CTE) for PM BLDC motor drives. The proposed scheme is aimed to enhance motor output torque by minimizing the generated torque ripples. The torque ripples originating from commutation instances cause spikes and dips in the motor output torque. The motor output torque could be enhanced by mitigating the phase current mismatch rate during phase current commutation period. This rate could be almost matched by introducing the commutation time estimator (CTE) in order to control the rate of the energized phase current to be matched with the de-energized phase rate. Results obtained have validated and verified the proposed CTE effectiveness with a 50% average reduction of the generated torque ripples in PM BLDC motor.,True,Y6J_gsUAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC,3,http://eprints.usm.my/38466/1/COMMUTATION_TIME_ESTIMATOR_FOR_PM_BLDC.pdf,12017203565168764453,/scholar?cites=12017203565168764453,,,http://eprints.usm.my/38466/1/COMMUTATION_TIME_ESTIMATOR_FOR_PM_BLDC.pdf,0,0,0

As one of the most available energy sources with high energy conversion efficiency. solar energy is the most prominent of these energies as it also has the least effect on the environment. Flat plate collectors are the most common solar collectors. while their efficiency is limited by their absorber’s effectiveness in energy absorption and the transfer of this energy to the working fluid. The efficiency of flat plate solar collectors can be increased by using nanofluids as the working fluid.

1307863,Optimal experimental design for inverse problems in the presence of observation correlations,2020,Ahmed Attia and Emil Constantinescu,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.14476,,,,Optimal experimental design (OED) is the general formalism of sensor placement and decisions about the data collection strategy for engineered or natural experiments. This approach is prevalent in many critical fields such as battery design. numerical weather prediction. geosciences. and environmental and urban studies. State-of-the-art computational methods for experimental design. however. do not accommodate correlation structure in observational errors produced by many expensive-to-operate devices such as X-ray machines. radars. and satellites. Discarding evident data correlations leads to biased results. higher expenses. and waste of valuable resources. We present a general formulation of the OED formalism for model-constrained large-scale Bayesian linear inverse problems. where measurement errors are generally correlated. The proposed approach utilizes the Hadamard product of matrices to formulate the weighted likelihood and is valid for both finite-and infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out for empirical verification of the proposed approach using an advection-diffusion model. where the objective is to optimally place a small set of sensors. under a limited budget. to predict the concentration of a contaminant in a closed and bounded domain.,True,JNwVf9sAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14476,12621079000281274593,/scholar?cites=12621079000281274593,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14476,0,0,0

Total energy gain depends on the total amount of radiation that strikes radiation collecting surface and this amount depends strongly on tilt angle. In the present study. the radiation collecting surface tilt angle was studied through two approach of study. First approach through getting the tilt angle of fully tracking solar system and then developed best tilt angle yearly and seasonally. Second approach depends on getting the evaluating the total solar radiation incident on surface tilt by certain angle then evaluating best angle. The first approach results show that tilt angle for latitudes from equator up to Cancer tropic is not equal to latitude angle while it approximately equal to latitude angle for latitudes started from Cancer tropic this is for one yearly fixed tilt angle. A correlation. for yearly best tilt angle as a function of latitude angle. was presented for both two cases single tilt angle and two tilt angles through year and a comparison between them was done. For latitudes next to Cancer tropic. the results showed that the value of enhancement. when using two tilt angles per year. may reach to 7.11% more than using single tilt angle per year and this value is directly proportional with latitude angle. Finally. using two tilt angles per year is more convenient. Results from first approach compared with data from second approach.

In order to tackle the problem of friction variations in such a pipeline. the explicit so-called Swamee-Jain equation is implanted for the friction. instead of a constant parameter as in other studies. The observer is then designed as an Extended Kalman filter on the basis of a discretized model both in time and in space. The space discretization is nonuniform depending on the unknown leak location. and the time variable is discretized with the Heun's method. The approach assumes only flow and pressure sensors at the ends of the duct. and experimental results with data obtained from the pipeline prototype are presented to assess the method efficiency.,True,6EWNwgQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,27,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6044397/,592555188631314715,/scholar?cites=592555188631314715,,,,0,0,0

Classically the friction model in leak detection algorithms only relies on a constant parameter. In the present work. the use of a more elaborate friction model is considered. with a coefficient explicitly depending on the flow. either algebraically. or even differentially. Those friction formulations are implemented within a nonlinear-observer-based algorithm for detection and location of leaks. which is analyzed. and tested with real measurements on some experimental pipeline prototype.

1307904,Modelling and control of water flow dynamics via a collocation method,2000,Didier Georges and Jean-françois Dulhoste and Gildas Besançon,,MTNS,,,,This paper is devoted to one-dimensional modelling of water flow dynamics for the goal of controlling irrigation canals or dam-river systems. Open-channel dynamics are based on the well-known Saint-Venant nonlinear partial differential equations [1]. In order to obtain a finitedimensional model. which could be much more tractable than those obtained from classical finite-difference or finite-element methods (from the viewpoint of both state dimension and structure) and well suited to control purposes. we introduce a collocation Galerkin method together with a functional approximation of the solutions of Saint-Venant equations based on Lagrange polynomials. Simulation results demonstrate that this collocation approach can provide realistic solutions. while the state dimension is dramatically reduced with regard to the case of an explicit finite-difference integration scheme. We also show that this model can be used to design a nonlinear controller for the goal of controlling both water flow and levels along an open-channel reach.,True,6EWNwgQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,20,http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~helton/MTNSHISTORY/CONTENTS/2000PERPIGNAN/CDROM/articles/B90.pdf,15082305424245581019,/scholar?cites=15082305424245581019,,,http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~helton/MTNSHISTORY/CONTENTS/2000PERPIGNAN/CDROM/articles/B90.pdf,0,0,0

In previous studies for such approaches. the observer is most of the time designed for a model obtained from hydraulic dynamical equations and finite difference techniques. using pressures at both ends of the pipe as boundary conditions; in the present work. the finite difference model is modified by using other boundary conditions. which are the pressure in the inlet pump and the pressure at the end of the pipe system. This modification provides a better representation of the pipeline dynamics. as illustrated by comparing the behavior simulated in this way with real data. It is then emphasized that this improved model may be used for an observer-based direct estimation of a possible leak flow in the pipe - together with its position. only using two measured variables (instead of four in former studies …,True,6EWNwgQAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,15,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6862388/,2908159864788912504,/scholar?cites=2908159864788912504,,,,0,0,0

1307909,Study of a flow model for detection and location of leaks and obstructions in pipes,2012,Marcos Guillén and Jean-François Dulhoste and Gildas Besancon and Rafael Santos,,,,,,This paper presents the development of a flow model for the final purpose to detect and locate leaks and obstructions in pipes. This model is based on one-dimensional water hammer partial differential equations. discretized with an explicit finite-difference method. to represent the unsteady incompressible flow in pipes. for a finite number of positions. First a study on the selection of boundary conditions for the best structure to represent a pipe system is proposed. This study intends to improve previous works based on some ‘simplified’finite-difference scheme and basically using pressure boundary conditions at both sides of the pipe (at the beginning and at the end). In particular all configurations of boundary conditions are reviewed. alternating between pressure and flow at each end. Then substitution of those boundary conditions by pump and flow restriction equations is considered. in order to obtain a more realistic model and consider the possibility to measure less variables. Some simulations are finally presented and compared with real data. illustrating how the pipe behavior is better represented with the new boundary conditions. pumps and restriction equations. Those behaviors are considered in particular in the presence of leaks. making the model of interest for possible use in leak detection and isolation.,True,6EWNwgQAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,11,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00728678/document,10354185866402578205,/scholar?cites=10354185866402578205,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00728678/document,0,0,0

1307923,On the design of a nonlinear state observer for the location of a blockage in a pipeline,2014,Ignacio Rubio Scola and Gildas Besancon and Didier Georges and Marcos Guillén and Jean-François Dulhoste and Rafael Santos,,,,n/c,,This paper presents a design of a nonlinear state observer in order to locate a blockage in a pipeline. by only using measurements at each end. First. a mathematical model of the pipeline is presented. using the water hammer equations and applying the finite difference method for the solution with n sections. Then. based on the experience got from the problem of leak location with nonlinear observers. a second mathematical model is obtained by discretization in only two sections. and a nonlinear state observer is built. In this new model. the blockage is at the beginning of the second section of the pipeline. whose position is to be estimated by the observer.

El modelo está basado en las ecuaciones diferenciales parciales de Golpe de Ariete. las cuales se discretizan utilizando el método de diferencias finitas. este método permite hacer una representación de un flujo incompresible inestable para un número finito de posiciones. El modelado de la obstrucción. se realiza de dos formas. En la primera forma. se supone que la obstrucción se presenta en un punto de la tubería. es decir. una obstrucción puntual y no un tramo obstruido como es el caso de la segunda forma. En la segunda forma. se supone que se presenta una reducción de área en la sección transversal de la tubería; esta reducción. se puede presentar ya sea en un tramo corto o largo de tubería. dependiendo de qué tan grave sea la obstrucción que se quiere simular.

El modelo de tubería está basado en las ecuaciones del Golpe de Ariete. las cuales se discretizan utilizando el método de diferencias finitas. El modelo de diferencias finitas utiliza como condiciones de frontera. la presión a la entrada de la bomba y la presión en el otro extremo de la tubería. Estas condiciones de frontera. producen una mejor representación del comportamiento dinámico de la tubería. tal como se evidencia en la comparación que se hace entre las simulaciones del modelo y los datos reales proporcionados por un banco de pruebas para fugas. Este modelo mejorado. puede utilizarse para estimar de manera directa el flujo de una fuga y la posición en la que se está presentando. usando solamente dos variables medidas: la presión en un extremo de la tubería y el flujo en el otro extremo. Las otras dos variables que son conocidas por el observador. se pueden tomar como valores constantes. ya que. son la presión a la entrada de la bomba y la presión atmosférica a la que descarga la tubería.

However. the criteria by which we train these algorithms often differ from the ultimate criteria on which we evaluate them. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for learning probabilistic machine learning models in a manner that directly captures the ultimate task-based objective for which they will be used. within the context of stochastic programming. We present three experimental evaluations of the proposed approach: a classical inventory stock problem. a real-world electrical grid scheduling task. and a real-world energy storage arbitrage task.

In this paper. we propose a new direction toward this goal by introducing a differentiable (smoothed) maximum satisfiability (MAXSAT) solver that can be integrated into the loop of larger deep learning systems. Our (approximate) solver is based upon a fast coordinate descent approach to solving the semidefinite program (SDP) associated with the MAXSAT problem. We show how to analytically differentiate through the solution to this SDP and efficiently solve the associated backward pass. We demonstrate that by integrating this solver into end-to-end learning systems. we can learn the logical structure of challenging problems in a minimally supervised fashion. In particular. we show that we can learn the parity function using single-bit supervision (a traditionally hard task for deep networks) and learn how to play 9x9 Sudoku solely from examples. We also solve a “visual Sudoku” problem that maps images of Sudoku puzzles to their associated logical solutions by combining our MAXSAT solver with a traditional convolutional architecture. Our approach thus shows promise in integrating logical structures within deep learning.,True,PfRSkfEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,56,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/wang19e.html,6370111040782984805,/scholar?cites=6370111040782984805,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/wang19e/wang19e.pdf,0,0,0

However. traditional state estimation techniques have difficulty coping with the  low-observability  conditions often present on the distribution system due to the paucity of sensors and heterogeneity of measurements. To address these limitations. we propose a distribution system state estimation algorithm that employs matrix completion (a tool for estimating missing values in low-rank matrices) augmented with noise-resilient power flow constraints.

1307949,Enforcing robust control guarantees within neural network policies,2020,Priya L Donti and Melrose Roderick and Mahyar Fazlyab and J Zico Kolter,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.08105,,,,When designing controllers for safety-critical systems. practitioners often face a challenging tradeoff between robustness and performance. While robust control methods provide rigorous guarantees on system stability under certain worst-case disturbances. they often result in simple controllers that perform poorly in the average (non-worst) case. In contrast. nonlinear control methods trained using deep learning have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many control tasks. but often lack robustness guarantees. We propose a technique that combines the strengths of these two approaches: a generic nonlinear control policy class. parameterized by neural networks. that nonetheless enforces the same provable robustness criteria as robust control. Specifically. we show that by integrating custom convex-optimization-based projection layers into a nonlinear policy. we can construct a provably robust neural network policy class that outperforms robust control methods in the average (non-adversarial) setting.

Dragon fruit is a round and often red-colored fruit with scales-like texture and is native to south American countries which is also cultivated and heavily marketed in southeast Asian countries. Its foliage represents a part of its overall plant system. Latex effluent is one of the main byproduct from rubber processing factories in Malaysia. Three main parameters investigated were chemical oxygen demand (COD). suspended solids (SS). and turbidity of effluent. Coagulation experiments using jar test were performed with a flocculation system where the effects of latex effluent pH as well as coagulation dosage on coagulation effectiveness were examined. The highest recorded COD. SS. and turbidity removal percentages for foliage were observed for effluent pH 10 at 94.7. 88.9. and 99.7%. respectively. It is concluded that the foliage showed tremendous potential as a natural coagulant for water treatment purposes.

Oil palm decanter cake (OPDC) is used as a bioadsorbent because of its compositional properties for activated carbon production; moreover. it is a readily available raw material produced in palm oil mills and is thus abundant and cheap. In this study. the OPDC was carbonized at 700 C and activated using steam at 700 C to produce oil palm decanter cake activated carbon (AC-OPDC). Batch adsorption experiments were carried out to compare the adsorption capacities of the raw OPDC and the AC-OPDC for heavy metals removal. The maximum adsorption capacities of AC-OPDC on Cu (II). Pb (II). and Zn (II) were found to be 45.01. 128.51. and 39.21 mg/g. respectively. which were higher than those of the raw OPDC.

Thus. the cogasification of blended biomass is a potential option to maintain feedstock supply for continuous gasification operations. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of biomass blending ratio and biomass particle size on the syngas quality and performance of the co-gasification process. The co-gasification of wood chips/coconut shells was carried out in a downdraft gasifier at a 400 L/min airflow rate. The biomass blending ratio varies at 80/20. 50/50 and 20/80 (w/w) with biomass particle sizes of 5-10. 10-25 and 25-50 mm. The results show that small particle size favours gas composition. The highest H2 (10.91%). CO (25.60%). and CH4 (2.79%) levels were obtained from the 5-10 mm particle size at 80/20. 50/50. and 20/80 blending ratios. respectively.

Determining the moisture content of a feedstock is considered to be one of the challenges of the process. The information about moisture content of a feedstock is required to decide the need for further drying prior to the gasification process. In this study. a novel method was developed for the evaluation of the moisture content from density of oil palm fronds (OPF) in a sufficiently accurate manner for gasification process. A total of 147 samples from different sections of freshly pruned fronds were prepared. The density of each of the samples was determined from its weight and volume. A fine sand displacement method. using fine sand and a graduated cylinder. determined the volume of OPF. The moisture content of the OPF was determined from the weight difference of the samples before and after the drying process.

The role of use-value production. income from wage-labour. state transfer payments. and the sale of commodities such as furs and handicrafts. as well as the patterns of bush-food distribution between domestic units in  reproducing the commensal family unit are considered in detail. -- One important conclusion of the thesis is that in  the post-contact period the general pattern of long-term change in Innu domestic production has been a transformation  away from reliance on income from fur sales to meet the needs of the household for essential commodities to a growing dependence on government transfer payments. Today. social security payments and other income indirectly derived  from government transfer payments are the motor of the economy in which the Innu are situated. Domestic activities.  whether these be hunting. fishing. trapping. gathering. or craft production. cannot be financed without these payments.  They are in a sense a form of guaranteed income. with numerous strings attached. which allow harvesting activities  to continue and even flourish in certain circumstances despite the rising demands for and cost of industrially-derived products. Thus. domestic production in La Romaine - harvesting practices. craft production. systems of cooperative labour and food distribution …,True,eOMHibMAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,2,http://research.library.mun.ca/4008/,17143862252531136847,/scholar?cites=17143862252531136847,,,,0,0,0

1308067,Atmospheric Vortex Engine Technical description,2007,Louis M Michaud,,,,,,An atmospheric vortex engine (AVE) is a device for producing mechanical energy by means of a controlled tornado-like vortex. The vortex is produced by admitting air tangentially at the base of a circular wall. The process could become a major source of clean energy and could provide other benefits such as precipitation and cooling. Vortex engines would help alleviate global warming by reducing fuel consumption or by hastening upward heat convection. The AVE would harness the process responsible for tornadoes and hurricanes. Raising a unit mass of warm moist air from the bottom to the top of the troposphere can produce as much energy as lowering a unit mass of water 1000 m.The operation of AVE is based on the facts that the atmosphere is heated from the bottom and cooled from the top and that more mechanical energy is produced by the expansion of a heated gas than is required to compress the same gas back to its original pressure after it has been cooled. The energy is produced as a result of reducing the temperature of the heat sink from to temperature at the bottom of the atmosphere to the temperature at the tropopause. The source of the energy is thermal convection. the process responsible for producing circulation in boilers and in many other industrial processes. The technology is akin to that of cooling towers.,True,feovBnsAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,1,http://wps.ablongman.com/wps/media/objects/12936/13246811/pdf/Description_2.pdf,15932348692554377124,/scholar?cites=15932348692554377124,,,http://wps.ablongman.com/wps/media/objects/12936/13246811/pdf/Description_2.pdf,0,0,0
1308068,Harnessing Energy from Convective Vortices,2011,Louis Michaud,,,,,,There is an urgent need to find a solution to global warming and to energy shortage. At present over 70% of the world’s energy is derived from greenhouse gas producing fossil fuels and there is no substitute in sight. A possible solution to this problem may be the extraction of energy from atmospheric vortices. Theory and experiments suggests that controlled atmospheric vortices can be used to harness energy. The energy produced in a single hurricane can exceed the energy produced by humans in a whole year. Harnessing a small fraction of the energy produced during upward heat convection in the atmosphere could supply human energy needs without carbon emissions.The scientific basis of atmospheric vortex engine (AVE) is consistent with the prevailing thermodynamic theory of vortical storms. The engineering approach used to analyze the process described in this article provides a range of valuable benefits. The technology has much potential and a focused development program to assess its feasibility is recommended. Power engineers could play a major role in the development of the AVE because of their practical knowledge of the thermodynamics of power cycles. convection processes and cooling towers. There will be technical challenges to overcome but they should be no more difficult than those found in the development of other industrial processes. Producing and controlling a vortex extending kilometers into the atmosphere is a major undertaking and cannot be done in the laboratory.,True,feovBnsAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1636785207130907840&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

The interface must also provide a means for the operator to drill down and explore specific application behaviors. The more complex the application. the more difficult it is to provide both effective summary information and simple methods for further exploration. Effective presentation of key plant data will improve application service factor and performance.This paper presents information about operator interfaces for DMCplus and DMCplus Composite systems at ethylene plants within ExxonMobil Chemical.

1308070,Subsidence Required to Replace Heat Loss by Radiation with Work of Compression by,2004,Louis M Michaud,,,,,,The temperature of the troposphere is constant over the long run because energy lost by radiation is compensated for by subsidence warming. Compensating for radiative cooling requires that the troposphere subside at a velocity of approximately 500 md-1. corresponding to subsidence mass fluxes of 5 kPa d-1 near the bottom and 1 kPa d-1 near the top of the troposphere. The mass flux decreasing in the upward direction results from surface air rising to a range of levels.The warming occurs where the air subsides and not where the latent heat of water vapour is released. The subsidence tends to occur where the atmosphere is coldest and easiest to compress. The warming produced by intense updrafts is not limited to the local area and can be distributed over the whole globe. The warming can occurs in areas remote from the updraft such as the rainless sub-tropical regions and the polar regions.,True,feovBnsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.576.6527&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.576.6527&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The heat to work conversion efficiency of the atmosphere is shown to be approximately one sixth because the average temperatures at which the atmosphere receives and gives up heat are≈ 300 K and≈ 250 K respectively. The conversion efficiency is essentially a function of the temperatures at which heat is received and given up. The mechanical energy produced and dissipated is in the 20-30 W m-2 range since the upward heat flux near the bottom of the atmosphere approximately 150 W m-2.,True,feovBnsAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3196894035741955651&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0
1308072,Could wind turbines be contributing to recent arctic warming and unusual extreme weather?,,Louis M Michaud,,,,,,Wind energy could be responsible for recent: rapid global warming. arctic amplification and unusual mid latitude extreme weather. The deployment of wind turbines over the last 15 year has been a major change to the earth system and could be having a significant effect on climate. Wind turbines could contribute to global warming by reducing prevailing westerly wind thereby reducing equatorward Coriolis force and facilitating poleward air flow. Increased poleward flow in the upper troposphere increases subsidence in higher latitude and the associated subsidence warming. Reducing Coriolis force diminishes a force resisting poleward air flow. Facilitating poleward flow is a more immediate global warming concern than greenhouse gasses because the heat stored in the warm seas is more than sufficient to melt all polar ice; there is no need to wait for radiative unbalance to warm the oceans.

In the coming years it is very possible that the incidence of spontaneous combustion will increase from current levels. due to factors such as an increased rate of mining. re-working of previously mined seams. more stooping and total extraction for underground mines. and higher stripping ratios for surface mines. leading to more spoils. It is also fairly certain that coal mining will face tougher environmental emissions legislation in the near future. To determine the areas where the risks of spontaneous combustion are high. it is necessary to improve on our current laboratory procedures for testing and evaluating coal samples. combining the results with site and field data. and if necessary revising the laboratory rating system to refine our understanding of South African conditions. Currently. laboratory tests are conducted in order to determine both the Wits-EHAC index and the crossing-point temperature which. when combined. give an indication of the spontaneous combustion propensities of the coal samples. This procedure has enabled the establishment of a database of results to review and evaluate South African coal seams. Using this database. the high-risk areas in terms of spontaneous combustion are identified. Tests have been undertaken for five consecutive years. between 2008 and 2012.

The Wits-Ehac index has been developed in South Africa since the late 1980’s to test the spontaneous combustion liability of coal. However. in some cases. the Wits-Ehac index fails to produce tangible results when testing coal-shales. To overcome this problem. a new apparatus has been developed to test carbonaceous materials such as coal and coal-shale under chemical reactions with oxygen and an index has been obtained. This index is called the Wits-CT index. The equipment emulates the influence of oxygen adsorption on carbonaceous material for a period of 24 h without a heating system.

Johnson Matthey (2008) reported that South Africa alone produced 77 per cent (5.035 million ounces) of the annual global platinum output during 2007. Anglo Platinum (Angloplat). the world’s foremost platinum producer. mined 2.47 million ounces of platinum in 2007. making up almost 50 per cent of the South African annual platinum production.The new and expansion projects by South African platinum producers can be partly attributable to the high platinum prices experienced in the current and recent years. However. it will continue to rely on future high platinum prices. In order to predict future platinum prices. the fundamentals affecting the platinum market must be examined.

The ability of ventilation. with the use of line brattices (LBs). to remove methane and coal dust in empty headings is dependent on the amount of air leaving the LB and entering the heading. The quantity of this air depends on the associated system variables. namely heading dimensions. settings of the LB. and velocity of air in the last through road (LTR). However. the exact effect of these system variables on the flow rate at the exit of the LB in an empty heading is not known. The installation of LBs in South African coal mines is generally carried out based on experience. This can result in over-or under-ventilation and may increase the cost of providing ventilation or cause accidents. respectively. In this paper. using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). the air flow rate at the exit of the LB in an empty heading was estimated using full-scale three-dimensional models. The CFD model used was validated using experimental results Firstly. the settings of these three system variables were varied. the flow rates at the exit of the LB were measured. and finally the results were used to calculate the effect of each system variable. The outcome is a mathematical formula that can be used to estimate air flow rate at the exit of the LB in empty headings for any practical scenario. This paper will help the coal mining sector in South Africa by providing estimation models based on scientific reasoning for the installation of LBs. and will also serve academia as part of the curriculum towards educating future mining engineers.,True,DQeDLGMAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,4,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2225-62532016001200010,5966050849693380410,/scholar?cites=5966050849693380410,,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2225-62532016001200010,0,0,0

The diameter of the duct. duct mouth to face distance. and the power of the fan (quantity delivered by the fan) were varied and their effect on ventilation determined through a comparative analysis of the flow rates calculated close to the face of the heading. Estimation models were developed. which can be used to calculate the flow rate close to the face of the empty heading for different settings of the system variables studied. The study showed that recirculation for a forcing ducted fan system can be reduced by increasing the duct diameter or increasing the duct mouth to face distance.

The problem comprises multiple and often conflicting optimization criteria for which no unique optimal solution can be determined with respect to all criteria. In this paper the generation scheduling is developed with regard to three objective functions: fuel cost. emissions of gaseous pollutants and unavailability of power generation. To solve the problem. an improved genetic algorithm is applied. First. the conventional generation scheduling is solved taking into consideration only the fuel cost. Second. the generation scheduling is solved as a combined risk-economic-environmental optimization problem that takes into consideration all of the above mentioned objectives. The Slovenian power system is used as a test power system. The results show that smart scheduling of power generation may decrease the emissions and increase the availability of power generation.,True,3pDpQIAAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,6,https://ev.fe.uni-lj.si/5-2013/Gjorgiev.pdf,8521847931154413769,/scholar?cites=8521847931154413769,,,https://ev.fe.uni-lj.si/5-2013/Gjorgiev.pdf,0,0,0
1308112,Nuclear power plant load following: problem definition and application,2011,Blaže Gjorgiev and Marko Čepin,,Proc. 20th Int. Conf. Nuclear Energy for New Europe 2011,,506-515,,The general opinion about nuclear power plants is that they are not flexible generating units characterized with low or no load following capabilities. Therefore they should be used as baseline units only. Given the economic perspective of this issue. it is clear that the reasons for use of nuclear power plants as baseline units are purely economic. They have the lowest variable costs compared with the other thermal generating units. It is of crucial importance to note that the flexibility and reliability of the power system directly depends on the flexibility and reliability of the generating units. Therefore it is very important to have flexible units which will be available to follow load in any time of the day. This is especially important in power systems where nuclear power has great portion in the power production. In such case the conventional units which are used for load following may not be enough to secure reliable operation of the power system. The objective of this paper is to investigate the parameters from nuclear safety. which may be affected by load following manoeuvres. For this purpose an existing probabilistic safety assessment model of nuclear power plant from generation III+ is used. The first step is identification of components and systems from the nuclear power plant which are affected from the load following and subsequent adaptation of the existing probabilistic model. The second step is testing of the model for any changes in core damage frequency. The expected results indicate no significant decrease in core damage frequency due to the extensive use of load following.,True,3pDpQIAAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,6,https://arhiv.djs.si/proc/nene2011/pdf/506.pdf,11498557089078787984,/scholar?cites=11498557089078787984,,,https://arhiv.djs.si/proc/nene2011/pdf/506.pdf,0,0,0

One of the main challenges is intermittent power production from some renewable power sources requiring compensation of the power by the remaining power plants in the given system. This paper presents the results of the analysis of a power system generation availability considering introduction of wind generating power units. The power system reliability is assessed by the Loss of load probability evaluated from the cumulative outage probability table. The analysis considers the uncertainty of the available power from the wind genera-tors and uncertainty of the peak load in the analyzed system. Weibull distribution is used for the characterization of the wind speed in the developed method. The consequences of the substitution of the nuclear power plants with the wind generators on the safety of the remaining operating nuclear power plants are analyzed. The core damage frequency obtained from the probabilistic safety assessment model of the nuclear power plant is used to evaluate the safety of the nuclear power plants.Obtained results show that introduction of wind generating units in the power system results in increase of the Loss of load probability. The obtained Loss of load probability depends on uncertainty of the peak load size and shape parameters of the wind speed in the model. Increase share of wind generation in overall power system generation results in increased Loss of load probability.

The objective of this paper is to assess the potential for model calibration. For that purpose. we propose a generic framework for the calibration of cascading failure analysis models. The framework is based on tuning the optimal values of model parameters. ie line/transformer tripping power-flow thresholds. which are usually diverse depending on the particular settings chosen by maintenance personnel. The framework application is exemplified by calibrating the parameters of a cascading failure model based on DC power flow (PF). The parameters are optimized through minimizing the difference between the probability distributions of historical blackout data and of the simulation results for the same electric power transmission system. The problem is casted as single-objective optimization and is solved using different optimization techniques. The efficiency of the proposed framework and the selected optimization techniques is demonstrated on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) power transmission system. The obtained results show that by tuning model parameters optimally. one can achieve a good agreement between the simulation results and the historical data.

If the European electricity grid faces difficulties in expanding cross border capacities. gas power plants could be the main flexible supply option between 2030 and 2050. Hence. the challenge is to accommodate a large share of Renewable Energy Resources (RES) in the power system. while for the gas sector mainly involves re-routing gas in a short period of time to provide fast ramping response from gas power plants to RES fluctuations.

1308132,Detailed numerical simulations of flame propagation in coal-dust clouds,2012,Li Qiao and Jian Xu,16,Combustion Theory and Modelling,5,747-773,Taylor & Francis Group,A detailed numerical study was conducted to understand the transient flame propagation process in coal-dust clouds. The model includes detailed chemistry for the gas-phase combustion; devolatilisation kinetics; full coupling between the gas and solid phases; and radiative heat transfer. Furthermore. it solves the gas- and particle-phase momentum equations for the two-phase dynamics. The results show that the flame-speed oscillation phenomenon. which in a previous study was observed for carbon-dust clouds. was not observed for high-volatile coal dust. This is because for high-volatile dusts. such as coal. surface reactions have little impact on flame propagation. which is in fact dominated by volatile combustion. The flame speed largely depends on the devolatilisation rate. For the same reason. neither radiative emission nor absorption is important in high-volatile dust flames because of the much shorter …,True,bvqXLDAAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,7,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13647830.2012.655312,13655068229421744815,/scholar?cites=13655068229421744815,,,,0,0,0

Golden. CO (United States),The rollout of hydrogen fueling stations. and the fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) they support. requires the assurance of high quality hydrogen at the dispensing point. Automotive fuel cells are sensitive to a number of chemicals that can be introduced into the dispensed fuel at multiple points. Quality assurance and quality control methods are employed by the industry to ensure product quality. but they are not completely comprehensive and can fail at various points in the hydrogen pathway from production to dispensing. This reality leaves open the possibility of a station unknowingly dispensing harmful contaminants to a FCEV which. depending on the contaminant. may not be discovered until the FCEV is irreparably damaged. This situation is unacceptable. A hydrogen contaminant detector (HCD). defined as a combination of a gas analyzer and the components necessary for fuel stream integration. installed at hydrogen stations is one method for preventing poor quality gas from reaching an FCEV.

Example of application is shown on halide perovskite thin film for which a large range of transport properties is given in the literature.

Using an evaporative cooling model inspired by the field of cold atoms. we derive an analytical expression supported by numerical calculations to account for the removal of particles from the distribution and subsequent energy redistribution among the remaining carriers. Depending on the filtering dimensionality and energy level of extraction. the distribution can be either heated up or cooled down. resulting in a modification of the current-voltage characteristic associated to the structure.

Practical realizations with nanostructures suffer from two intrinsic deficiencies: narrow absorption widths and low radiative efficiencies. We evaluate in this paper the theoretical efficiency expectations with respect to those two properties. and consider in addition the possibility of including an electronic ratchet. We observe that an intermediate band solar cell using a ratchet becomes highly tolerant to non-ideal nanostructures. so that any combination of low absorption and low radiative efficiency becomes compatible with optimized performances above the Shockley-Queisser limit.

Enzymes lower the energy required for a reaction to occur. without being used up in the reaction. Many types of industries. to aid in the generation of their products. utilize enzymes. Examples of these products are; cheese. alcohol and bread. Fermentation is a method of generating enzymes for industrial purposes. Fermentation involves the use of microorganisms. like bacteria and yeast to produce the enzymes. There are two methods of fermentation used to produce enzymes. These are submerged fermentation and solid-state fermentation. Submerged fermentation involves the production of enzymes by microorganisms in a liquid nutrient media. Solid-state fermentation is the cultivation of microorganisms. and hence enzymes on a solid substrate. Carbon containing compounds in or on the substrate are broken down by the microorganisms. which produce the enzymes either intracellular or extracellular. The enzymes are recovered by methods such as centrifugation. for extracellularly produced enzymes and lysing of cells for intracellular enzymes. Many industries are dependent on enzymes for the production of their goods. Industries that use enzymes generated by fermentation are the brewing. wine making. baking and cheese making.,True,CO_wZHAAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,60,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1647253117953723381&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1647253117953723381,/scholar?cites=1647253117953723381,,,,0,0,0
1308201,Biodiesel from algae oil as an alternative fuel for diesel engine,2011,Niraj S Topare and VC Renge and Satish V Khedkar and YP Chavan and SL Bhagat,2,Int J Chem Environ Pharm Res,,116-120,,Biodiesel has become more attractive recently because of its environmental benefits and the fact that it is made from renewable resources. The world is getting modernized and industrialized day by day. As a result vehicles and engines are increasing. But energy sources used in these engines are limited and decreasing gradually. This situation leads to seek an alternative fuel for diesel engine. Biodiesel is an alternative fuel for diesel engine. The esters of vegetables oil animal fats are known as Biodiesel. This paper discussed about the prospect of making of biodiesel from Algae oil. Algae are generally microscopic organisms. are generally thought of as simple aquatic plants which do not have roots. stems or leave and have primitive methods of reproduction. Aquatic algae are found in both fresh and marine waters. They range in size from large kelp (meters in length) to those visible only under a microscope. Algae vary considerably in size. shape. and growth form. The Algae contain 2-65% oil with different species. In this study the oil has been converted to biodiesel by the well-known transesterification process and used it to diesel engine for performance evaluation.,True,CO_wZHAAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,26,https://www.academia.edu/download/32759619/PAPER-3.pdf,12692525501132002657,/scholar?cites=12692525501132002657,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/32759619/PAPER-3.pdf,0,0,0

But with the present rate of consumption. conventional sources of energy like natural gas and petroleum will be exhausted shortly. That’s why the concept of using bioenergy is giving attention worldwide. Hence. biofuels appears to be a proven renewable energy option. In this paper. we address the issue of producing vegetable oil from Jatropha Curcas seeds. using both mechanical and solvent extraction methods. We are also interested in the production of biodiesel from the raw oil obtained (ie transesterification or alcoholysis). Results showed that solvent extraction produced high quality oil than mechanical extraction. It was also found that parameters such as oil temperature. reaction temperature. ratio of alcohol to oil and purity of reactants are factors that affect the transesterification process.

In most cases these enter the wastewater after being excreted in urine and faeces. In the sewage plant. a part of the substances is eliminated via sorption and biological degradation. The rest is discharged with the treated effluent. In surface water and during bank infiltration further elimination is observed but some micropollutants persist. acting as wastewater tracer in groundwater and are also detected in drinking water. This article describes possible measures for eliminating trace organics in waste and drinking water treatment. These include on the one hand. permanent measures at the source such as an ecolabel for pharmaceuticals and personal care products as well as the separate treatment of strongly polluted wastewater. eg in hospital or industry.

Hosiery industries are having the abundant waste of the cotton rags and fabric cuttings during the manufacturing the finished products. Near about 8-9% of waste is generated from these industries. As cotton is having highest percentage of cellulose (87-96%). it can be used for manufacturing microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). Microcrystalline cellulose is used in various industries like pharmaceutical. food. cosmetics etc. It can be derived by number of process like reactive extrusion. enzyme mediated. steam explosion and acid hydrolysis. Out of these processes. the acid hydrolysis is used in present study. because it requires shorter reaction time than others. It can be made continuous and it requires less amount of acid and produces smaller particles of microcrystalline cellulose. For this study. three acids have been used. hydrochloric acid (HCl). sulphuric acid (H2SO4). and nitric acid (HNO3) for the production of MCC. To find the best concentration of acid for getting the higher yield in the process. the different concentrations were tried. 2.1 N Hydrochloric acid was found to give the highest yield of 93%. 40%(by weight) concentration of sulphuric acid gives the 90% yield and 65%(by weight) concentration of nitric acid gives the 82% yield.

For detailed study data for preparing DEM. aspect grid and slope maps and GIS was used in evaluation of basic. linear. areal and relief aspects of morphometric parameters. Watershed boundary. flow accumulation. flow direction. flow length. stream ordering have prepared using spatial analyst Tool. Hydrological module of ARC GIS 10.1 software was utilized for calculation and delineation of the watershed and morphometric analysis of the watershed using spatial analyst tool. The dendritic type drainage network of the basin exhibits the homogeneity in texture and lack of structural control. The Stream order ranges from first to fifth order. The drainage density in the area has been found to be low to medium which indicates that the area possesses highly permeable soils and low relief. The bifurcation ratio varies from 4.80 to 8 and the elongation ratio is 0.21 which reveals that the basin belongs to the medium elongated shaped basin category. The mean Rb of the entire basin is 5.95 which indicate that the drainage pattern is not much influenced by geological structures.

1308220,SPECIAL ISSUE FOR,,SV KHEDKAR and DRNW INGOLE,,,,,,In the recent few years ultrasound has resurfaced as a possible method for the treatment of industrial waste. The research in the area of ultrasound is increasing day by day. This can be seen easily from the number of papers published on ultrasound every year. Ultrasound is versatile and energetic method to treat industrial waste in a short duration of time with lesser costs. The method is still in its growing phase hence it’s not a process you will see in every industry. The application of the method differs with differing wastes. Still it is a method worth giving a try with respect to the simplicity. cost reduction and time reduction of treatment and finally the efficiencies obtained after treatment. Ultrasound has been tried on many industrial wastes consisting different physical and chemical compositions. It’sa most suitable method for the hazardous wastes where the volume is low and polluting power is more.

The periodic flow reversal converter is found effective to treat engine exhausts that are difficult to cope with conventional unidirectional flow converters. However. the previous work indicates that the exhaust temperature from modern diesel engines is commonly insufficient to sustain a high conversion or regeneration rate and thus supplemental heating techniques are commonly applied.

To implement the external fuel injection. an array of thermocouples and pressure sensors in the DPF provide the necessary feedback to the control system. The external fuel injection is dynamically adjusted based on the thermal response of the DPF substrate to improve the thermal management and to reduce the supplemental energy.

1308242,Study of Diesel Low Temperature Combustion Using Large Eddy Simulations,2009,Siddhartha Banerjee,,,,,,Turbulence plays a crucial role in the operation of modern diesel engine [1]. In-cylinder turbulence helps in effective fuel air mixing in the combustion chamber within the short time duration of engine cycle. Most diesel engines induct fuel into its combustion chamber by direct injection (DI) of liquid fuel during the compression stroke. Liquid jet of diesel fuel breaks into smaller blobs of droplets and subsequently evaporates due to higher surrounding temperature. Evaporated gaseous fuel then mix sufficiently with the intake charge before it is ignited. Although the procedures starts in the sequence mentioned above. it is often the case in diesel combustion that these processes overlap with each other. This routine stops by the time fuel is sufficiently consumed and chemical reactions freeze at some time during the expansion stroke. The chemical end products are then passed to the exhaust manifold starting at the time of …,True,eTX1dWAAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15749989098754816729&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

The PE region comprises two discontinuous first order like transitions. located near its onset and peak positions and reflects a stepwise fracturing of the flux line lattice (FLL). This scenario can be construed as an alternative to a scheme involving the appearance of Generalized Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (GFFLO) state as considered in the case of PE phenomenon in isostructural Yb  Rh  Sn  system. The procedure of thermal cycling across the onset position of PE produces an open hysteresis loop. which is consistent with the notion of the fracturing of the FLL. A study of thermomagnetic history dependence of different metastable vortex states shows the path dependence in the critical current density J_c (H. T) over a large part of the (H. T) parameter space. The path dependence in J_c ceases above the peak position of the PE. suggesting a complete amorphization and the loss of long range correlations of the FLL at (T_p. H_p) line.

The use of biodiesel in a CI engine leads to poor performance and high brake specific fuel consumption due to the higher viscosity and lower calorific value of biodiesel. This problem can be reduced by increasing the injection temperature of biodiesel or its blends to a certain temperature. In this study. working fuel is tested at preheating temperatures of 95 °C for various loading conditions (0. 25. 50. 75 and 100%). Effect of different KOME biodiesel–diesel blends (B0. B30.

University of Delaware. funded by a grant by the BP Foundation. The purpose of this study is to examine the climate change implications of the introduction of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles into the US transportation sector. The previously developed first year report focused on how state policy may interact with the development of a hydrogen economy. The second year report created a modeling tool to quantitatively measure the carbon impacts of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on US fleets.(Waegel et al. 2006b; Waegel et al. 2005) This third year report presents a more complex and flexible model intended to handle a large range of vehicles. fuels and technologies and corresponding policy scenarios. The model. dubbed CarCarbon. can be used as a projection tool to shed light on the future of vehicular transportation. Specifically. CarCarbon provides projections regarding types of vehicles people will be driving in future years and the effect these vehicles will have on carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption. The model relies on a number of attributes. such as vehicle ownership growth. fuel economy trends. the price of fuels. and many others in order to create a projection of market demand for various vehicle technologies. such as gas-electric hybrids. gasoline internal combustion engines (ICEs). or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The market demand for the various technologies is combined with the expected growth rate of the vehicle ownership each year in order to create a 25-year annual “snapshot” representative of …,True,qSHDojkAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1,https://trid.trb.org/view/868272,8346149976492929536,/scholar?cites=8346149976492929536,,,,0,0,0

1308345,Assessing the accuracy of hexagonal versus square tilled grids in preserving DEM surface flow directions,2006,Luís de Sousa and Fernanda Nery and Ricardo Sousa and João Matos,,Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Spatial Accuracy Assessment in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences,,,,The theoretical advantages of hexagonal grids over rectangular grids have been known for a large number of years. Among these. two can be stressed out: the higher spatial resolution achieved with the same number of samples and the isotropy of local neighbourhoods. This work explores such advantages in the representation of flow directions used in hydrologic modeling. The 3 arc-second resolution DEM data collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was resampled to increasingly lower resolution grids. both of squares and hexagons. The flow direction vectors where computed in each of these grids using the steepest down slope neighbour criteria; for the hexagonal grids an equivalent model was used. Reference data was obtained from the original full resolution DEM. calculating the resulting flow direction vectors of the samples contained inside each of the lower resolution cells. The accuracy of each model in preserving the original DEM flow direction characteristics was assessed by comparing the angles defined by lower resolution flow vectors with the resulting vectors of the corresponding full resolution samples. In the data analysis phase. the influence of local terrain morphology and variability was evaluated. A set of tests where conducted in the Minho River basin (ca. 16950 Km2 in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula). The results obtained suggest a superior capacity of the hexagonally tilled grids in maintaining the original flow directions. as given by the resulting vector of the original samples.,True,nQpZSTYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,25,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.485.7483&rep=rep1&type=pdf,4379836473257662791,/scholar?cites=4379836473257662791,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.485.7483&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1308353,New implementation of OGC Web Processing Service in Python programming language. PyWPS-4 and issues we are facing with processing of large raster data using OGC WPS,2016,Jáchym Čepický and Luís Moreira de Sousa,,Int. Arch. Photogramm. Remote Sens. Spatial Inf. Sci.,XLI-B7,927-930,,The OGC® Web Processing Service (WPS) Interface Standard provides rules for standardizing inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for geospatial processing services. such as polygon overlay. The standard also defines how a client can request the execution of a process. and how the output from the process is handled. It defines an interface that facilitates publishing of geospatial processes and client discovery of processes and and binding to those processes into workflows. Data required by a WPS can be delivered across a network or they can be available at a server. PyWPS was one of the first implementations of OGC WPS on the server side. It is written in the Python programming language and it tries to connect to all existing tools for geospatial data analysis. available on the Python platform. During the last two years. the PyWPS development team has written a new version (called PyWPS-4) completely from scratch. The analysis of large raster datasets poses several technical issues in implementing the WPS standard. The data format has to be defined and validated on the server side and binary data have to be encoded using some numeric representation. Pulling raster data from remote servers introduces security risks. in addition. running several processes in parallel has to be possible. so that system resources are used efficiently while preserving security.

Silva,20,GeoInformatica,1,,Springer,This article describes DSL3S. a domain specific modelling language for Spatial Simulation in the field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Techniques such as cellular automata and agent-based modelling have long been used to capture and simulate the temporal dynamics of spatial information. Tools commonly employed to implement spatial simulation models include code libraries and pre-compiled models; the former require advanced programming skills while the latter impose relevant constraints on application scope. Previous attempts to produce domain specific languages in the field have invariably resulted in new textual programming languages (e.g. SELES. NetLogo.

1308357,Review of spatial simulation tools for geographic information systems,2011,L de Sousa and Alberto Rodrigues da Silva,,Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Advances in System Simulation (SIMUL 2011),,1-6,ThinkMind,Spatial simulation has been largely absent from traditional Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software packages. Both the advanced skills needed to use this technique and the relative specificity of its application has resulted in a myriad of independent tools. each with different features. The choice of a proper tool for disclosing the dynamics of change in a GIS context is anything but obvious. This work presents a comparative review of different types of tools available for the development of Spatial Dynamics models. These tools are compared along three different vectors: application domain. ease of use by non-programmers (the typical GIS technician) and interoperability with geo-referenced data.

Since the 1990s two main techniques have been applied to perform this sort of spatial analysis: Cellular Automata [1] and Agent-based modelling [2]. The simulation models produced with these methods tend to be quite specific. only usable within the particular field of application. largely due to the multi-dimensional and heterogeneous character of spatial data. Mainly for this reason. modern multi-purpose GIS packages. such as GRASS 1 or ArcGIS 2. largely lack tools dedicated to this technology.Developing a spatial simulation model using a general purpose programming language presents several burdens. Besides implementing the model. the program has to control the flow of execution. manage system resources. and manipulate data structures. This leads to several problems [3]:(i) difficulties verifying correct implementation;(ii) limited model generality due to difficult modification and/or adaptation;(iii) difficulty comparing computer models. usually restricted to their inputs and outputs [4];(iv) problematic integration with other models or tools (eg GIS or visualisation packages).,True,nQpZSTYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1058.8247&rep=rep1&type=pdf,1144801606334895019,/scholar?cites=1144801606334895019,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1058.8247&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Geo-Inf.,8,,,This study compares the performance of five popular equal-area projections supported by Free and Open Source Software for Geo-spatial (FOSS4G)—Sinusoidal. Mollweide. Hammer. Eckert IV and Homolosine. A set of 21.872 discrete distortion vindicatrices were positioned on the ellipsoid surface. centred on the cells of a Snyder icosahedral equal-area grid. These indicatrices were projected on the plane and the resulting angular and distance distortions computed. all using FOSS4G. The Homolosine is the only projection that manages to minimise angular and distance distortions simultaneously. It yields the lowest distortions among this set of projections and clearly outclasses when only land masses are considered. These results also indicate the Sinusoidal and Hammer projections to be largely outdated. imposing too large distortions to be useful. In contrast. the Mollweide and Eckert IV projections present trade-offs between visual expression and accuracy that are worth considering. However. for the purposes of storing and analysing big spatial data with FOSS4G the superior performance of the Homolosine projection makes its choice difficult to avoid.
