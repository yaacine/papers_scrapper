1092243,chemistry & chemical engineering,,Reza Naeli and Vali Ahmad Sajadian and Bizhan Honarvar and Meisam Adibifard,,,,,,Estimating CO2 solubility in various solutions such as brine is one of the crucial tasks in CO2 absorption phenomenon used in desperate chemical industries. Different techniques such as experimental procedures. models. and correlations have been introduced to estimate the mentioned parameter. However. experimental methods are very expensive and time consuming. Although there are some physical and thermo-dynamical models developed for this purpose. they are restricted with certain pressure and the temperature ranges and are also associated with mathematical complications. Hence. these models are not reliable for all pressure-temperature conditions and they are difficult to be implemented. Therefore. developing a cheap. fast and rigorous technique to estimate the CO2 solubility in brine solution seems ineluctable. Therefore. to overcome the aforementioned problems. an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed in this study to estimate the CO2 solubility in the brine solution and its results are compared with Duan and Sun’s (2003) model. and Henry’s correlation (2008). Both statistical analysis and regression plot unveils that the developed ANN-based model outperforms the indicated physical model and correlation in estimating the CO2-brine solubility data.,True,f7ssPuMAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Reza_Naeli3/publication/325257126_CO2_Brine_Solubility_Estimation_Using_Artificial_Neural_Network_for_CCS_CO2_Storage_and_Sequestration_Implementation_in_Underground_Reservoirs/links/5b041dff4585154aeb078835/CO2-Brine-Solubility-Estimation-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network-for-CCS-CO2-Storage-and-Sequestration-Implementation-in-Underground-Reservoirs.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Reza_Naeli3/publication/325257126_CO2_Brine_Solubility_Estimation_Using_Artificial_Neural_Network_for_CCS_CO2_Storage_and_Sequestration_Implementation_in_Underground_Reservoirs/links/5b041dff4585154aeb078835/CO2-Brine-Solubility-Estimation-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network-for-CCS-CO2-Storage-and-Sequestration-Implementation-in-Underground-Reservoirs.pdf,0,0,0

Pa.. etc.] American Chemical Society [etc.],Controlled drug delivery technology represents one of the most rapidly advancing areas of science in which chemists and chemical engineers are contributing to human health care. Such delivery systems offer numerous advantages compared to conventional dosage forms including improved efficacy. reduced toxicity. and improved patient compliance and convenience. Such systems often use synthetic polymers as carriers for the drugs. By so doing. treatments that would not otherwise be possible are now in conventional use. Although the introduction of the first clinical controlled release systems occurred less than 25 years ago. 1997 sales of advanced drug delivery systems in the United States alone were approximately $14 billion dollars. 1 In this paper. we examine the breadth. the mechanisms. and rationale for controlled drug delivery and then focus our attention on some of the major families of synthetic polymers being used in the field.This review examines the chemical issues involved in the design of synthetic polymers used in the controlled release of drugs. Before considering the variety and the evolution of these polymeric structures. it is necessary to examine the motivation for achieving controlled release. This field of pharmaceutical technology has grown and diversified rapidly in recent years.

In mass‐weighted coordinates. this path corresponds to the intrinsic reaction coordinate. Points on the reaction path are found by constrained optimizations involving all internal degrees of freedom of the molecule. The points are optimized so that the segment of the reaction path between any two adjacent points is given by an arc of a circle. and so that the gradient at each point is tangent to the path. Only the transition vector and the energy gradients are needed to construct the path. The resulting path is continuous. differentiable and piecewise quadratic. In the limit of small step size. the present algorithm is shown to take a step with the correct tangent vector and curvature vector; hence. it is a second order algorithm. The method has been tested on the following reactions: HCN→CNH …,True,eP4l3aoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,5471,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.456010,10278022642960329768,/scholar?cites=10278022642960329768,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Gonzalez28/publication/234965295_An_Improved_Algorithm_For_Reaction-Path_Following/links/004635242ec3cec2db000000.pdf,0,0,0

1092299,Optimization of equilibrium geometries and transition structures,1982,H Bernhard Schlegel,3,Journal of Computational Chemistry,2,214-218,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,A modified conjugate gradient algorithm for geometry optimization is outlined for use with ab initio MO methods. Since the computation time for analytical energy gradients is approximately the same as for the energy. the optimization algorithm evaluates and utilizes the gradients each time the energy is computed. The second derivative matrix. rather than its inverse. is updated employing the gradients. At each step. a one‐dimensional minimization using a quartic polynomial is carried out. followed by an n‐dimensional search using the second derivative matrix. By suitably controlling the number of negative eigenvalues of the second derivative matrix. the algorithm can also be used to locate transition structures.

Inc.,A redundant internal coordinate system for optimizing molecular geometries is constructed from all bonds. all valence angles between bonded atoms. and all dihedral angles between bonded atoms. Redundancies are removed by using the generalized inverse of the G matrix; constraints can be added by using an appropriate projector. For minimizations. redundant internal coordinates provide substantial improvements in optimization efficiency over Cartesian and nonredundant internal coordinates. especially for flexible and polycyclic systems. Transition structure searches are also improved when redundant coordinates are used and when the initial steps are guided by the quadratic synchronous transit approach. © 1996 by John Wiley & Sons.

Unfortunately. a spin unrestricted wave function can contain large contributions from unwanted spin states that can distort the potential energy surface significantly. The spin contamination can be removed by projection or annihilation operators. As is well known. the spin project unrestricted Hartree–Fock bond dissociation curves have a large kink at the onset of the UHF/RHF instability. and a spurious minimum just beyond. However. the spurious minimum disappears and the kink is very much less pronounced at the unrestricted Mo/ller–Plesset level with spin projection.

These isocyanate-treated GOs (iGOs) can then be exfoliated into functionalized graphene oxide nanoplatelets that can form a stable dispersion in polar aprotic solvents. Characterization of iGOs by FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis suggested that the isocyanate treatment results in the functionalization of the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in GO via formation of amides and carbamate esters. respectively. The degree of GO functionalization can be controlled via either the reactivity of the isocyanate or the reaction time.

1092364,Best practice methods for determining an electrode material's performance for ultracapacitors,2010,Meryl D Stoller and Rodney S Ruoff,3,,9,1294-1301,Royal Society of Chemistry,Ultracapacitors are rapidly being adopted for a wide range of electrical energy storage applications. While ultracapacitors are able to deliver high rates of charge and discharge. they are limited in the amount of energy stored. The capacity of ultracapacitors is largely determined by the electrode material and as a result research to improve the performance of electrode materials has dramatically increased. While test methods for packaged ultracapacitors are well developed. it is often impractical for the materials scientist to assemble full sized. packaged cells to test electrode materials. Methodology to reliably measure a material's performance for use as an ultracapacitor electrode is not well standardized with various techniques yielding widely varying results.

Here. we show experimentally that κ of monolayer graphene exfoliated on a silicon dioxide support is still as high as about 600 watts per meter per kelvin near room temperature. exceeding those of metals such as copper.

N-graphene was produced by annealing of graphene oxide (G-O) under ammonia or by annealing of a N-containing polymer/reduced graphene oxide (RG-O) composite (polyaniline/RG-O or polypyrrole/RG-O). The effects of the N precursors and annealing temperature on the performance of the catalyst were investigated. The bonding state of the N atom was found to have a significant effect on the selectivity and catalytic activity for ORR. Annealing of G-O with ammonia preferentially formed graphitic N and pyridinic N centers. while annealing of polyaniline/RG-O and polypyrrole/RG-O tended to generate pyridinic and pyrrolic N moieties. respectively.

Recently. chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hydrocarbons has shown some promise in growing large-area graphene or few-layer graphene films on metal substrates such as Ni and Cu. It has been proposed that CVD growth of graphene on Ni occurs by a C segregation or precipitation process whereas graphene on Cu grows by a surface adsorption process. Here we used carbon isotope labeling in conjunction with Raman spectroscopic mapping to track carbon during the growth process. The data clearly show that at high temperatures sequentially introduced isotopic carbon diffuses into the Ni first. mixes. and then segregates and precipitates at the surface of Ni forming graphene and/or graphite with a uniform mixture of 12C and 13C as determined by the peak position of the Raman G-band peak.

The tensile and bending stiffness constants of ideal multi-walled and single-walled carbon nano-tubes are derived in terms of the known elastic properties of graphite. Tensile strengths are estimated by scaling the 20 GPa tensile strength of Bacon's graphite whiskers. The natural resonance (fundamental vibrational frequency) of a cantilevered single-wall nanotube of length 1 micron is shown to be about 12 MHz. It is suggested that the thermal expansion of carbon nanotubes will be essentially isotropic. which can be contrasted with the strongly anisotropic expansion in “conventional” (large diameter) carbon fibers and in graphite.

First. it gives uniformly high asymmetric inductions throughout a range of substitution patterns5. 17 in the allylic alcohol substrate (Table I). Second. upon use of a given tartrate enantiomer. the system seems obliged to deliver the ep-oxide oxygen from the same enantioface of the olefin regardless of the substitution pattern. Thislatter characteristic is highlighted in Scheme I: when the olefinic unit is in the plane of the drawing with the hydroxymethyl substituent at the lower right as shown. the use of (+)-diethyl tartrate leads to additionof the epoxide oxygen from the bottom. Of course. when (-)-diethyl tartrate is employed. the epoxide oxygen is added from the top.

A Wiley Company,The conductor‐like solvation model. as developed in the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM). has been reformulated and newly implemented in order to compute energies. geometric structures. harmonic frequencies. and electronic properties in solution for any chemical system that can be studied in vacuo. Particular attention is devoted to large systems requiring suitable iterative algorithms to compute the solvation charges: the fast multipole method (FMM) has been extensively used to ensure a linear scaling of the computational times with the size of the solute. A number of test applications are presented to evaluate the performances of the method. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

The study reveals that the relatively cheap 6‐31+G(d.p) basis set performs a very good job for harmonic frequency calculations and that B3LYP anharmonicities are in close agreement with the reference values irrespective of the basis set used. On these grounds “hybrid force fields” are proposed to achieve the best compromise between computer time and quality of the results. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

While information can be gained. in principle. by a variety of spectroscopic techniques. the interpretation of the rich indirect information that can be inferred from the analysis of experimental spectra is seldom straightforward because of the subtle interplay of several different effects. whose specific role is not easy to separate and evaluate. In such a complex scenario. theoretical studies can be very helpful at two different levels: (i) supporting and complementing experimental results to determine the structure of the target molecule starting from its spectral properties; (ii) dissecting and evaluating the role of different effects in determining the observed spectroscopic properties. This is the reason why computational spectroscopy is rapidly …,True,ltONfGAAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC,160,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar7002144,11525997902350569063,/scholar?cites=11525997902350569063,,http://www.ibb.cnr.it/index.php/papers/papers/journal_pone_0134963_3fa6178bb9f0.pdf?command=search&orderby=0&table=bibliography&table=bibliography&idb=9209&and2=&nosearch=0,0,0,0

The method combines the well-established hybrid ONIOM scheme with the recently developed ADMP (Atom-Centered Density Matrix Propagation) approach. where the one electron density matrix expanded in an atom-centered Gaussian basis set is propagated as electronic variables along with the classical nuclear degrees of freedom via an extended Lagrangian procedure. The unified and single-valued ONIOM expressions for the energy and energy derivatives allow for an implementation of conservative dynamics. It is found that atom-centered basis sets large enough to provide good chemical accuracy can be used even when electronic embedding is adopted in the QM/MM scheme. and this does not affect the well-behaved and conservative nature of the dynamics. The method contains very appealing features for the …,True,ltONfGAAAAAJ:jL-93Qbq4QoC,130,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp0370829,13888976552421257784,/scholar?cites=13888976552421257784,,http://www.chem.wayne.edu/schlegel/Pub_folder/279.pdf,0,0,0

Anharmonic corrections have been obtained by a second order perturbative treatment (PT2) recently introduced by one of the authors in the Gaussian program. At the B3LYP level inclusion of anharmonic contributions reduces the absolute average error by nearly an order of magnitude. whereas BLYP results are not equally satisfactory due to an overall underestimation of harmonic frequencies. The agreement of B3LYP/PT2 results with experiments paves the route for reliable yet affordable studies of molecules of biological interest by a completely automatic procedure without any scaling factor.,True,ltONfGAAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC,115,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261404003665,7136706675313197099,/scholar?cites=7136706675313197099,,,0,0,0
