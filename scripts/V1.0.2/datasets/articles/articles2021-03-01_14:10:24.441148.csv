1094867,Energy efficiency and cost saving opportunities in public and commercial buildings in developing countries–the case of air-conditioners in Ghana,2019,Richard Opoku and Isaac Adjei Edwin and Kofi A Agyarko,230,Journal of Cleaner Production,,937-944,Elsevier,Available data and market surveys conducted in Ghana have shown that 60–80% of electricity consumed in offices of public and commercial buildings is used to run air-conditioners to provide indoor thermal comfort for productive office work. Electricity consumptions of these air-conditioners are relatively high and are in the range of 3000–5400 kWh/yr per air-conditioner depending on the brand and the cooling capacity. Low energy efficiency rating of the air-conditioners is a major contributing factor to their high electricity consumption.This present work has conducted studies on the energy efficiency of air-conditioners used in the offices of public and commercial buildings in Ghana. Technical data from a national survey conducted on air-conditioning equipment used in the country was used for this study. In addition. a power quality clamp meter was used to monitor the actual power consumptions of stratified …,True,TD-_XZYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619315872,4365592121443090484,/scholar?cites=4365592121443090484,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619315872,0,0,0

1094930,Degradation effects in polyester and vinyl ester resins induced by accelerated aging in seawater,2012,AM Visco and V Brancato and N Campo,46,Journal of composite materials,17,2025-2040,Sage Publications,This research is a study on the degradation effects caused by seawater absorption of isophthalic polyester and vinyl ester resin employed in boat manufacture. Physical and mechanical tests of the resins were performed before and after the degradation. The results highlighted that the polyester resin is more degraded than the vinyl one. due to a different network organization of the two materials. The polyester has a biphasic structure with a low compactness. so water diffusion into the bulk is highly favored. The degradation occurs mainly by the leaching of small molecules extracted from the resin bulk by the water. Damages (cracks. holes. blisters) are evident and the resin loses its mechanical performance. The vinyl network is monophasic and compact. so avoids the entry of water; its degradation occurs differently. by a hydrolytic surface erosion of resin layers. In this way. it retains its bulk better compared to the …,True,mVbw3WYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,23,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021998311428533,454869967412524301,/scholar?cites=454869967412524301,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.829.152&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In particular. jute and basalt/jute reinforced composite plates were manufactured by vacuum assisted resin infusion in two different staking sequences (i.e.. intercalated and sandwich-like basalt-jute) and aged under salt fog conditions. The effects of the accelerated aging at increasing times on the mechanical response of laminates were assessed in both quasi static (three point bending) and dynamic (low velocity impact) conditions.

Sorption isobars. isochores and isotherms at T=20–150°C and vapor partial pressures of 8–133 mbar clearly showed two types of water sorption: 1) the formation of solid crystal hydrates at low amounts N of sorbed water. and 2) vapor absorption mainly by the salt solution at higher N. Sorption properties of CaCl2 crystal hydrates were found to change strongly due to their impregnation into mesoporous silica gel. whereas the solution confinement to the mesopores did not change its water sorption properties with respect to the bulk solution.

The chemical treatment of kenaf fibers for 48 h allowed to clean their surface removing each impurity whereas 144 h of immersion time had detrimental effect on the fibers surface and. consequently. on their mechanical properties.Untreated and NaOH treated kenaf fibers (i.e. for 48 h) were also used as reinforcing agent of epoxy resin composites. The effect of the stacking sequence (i.e. using unidirectional long fibers or randomly oriented short fibers) and the chemical treatment on the static mechanical properties was evaluated showing that the composites exhibit higher moduli in comparison to the neat resin. As regards the strength properties. only the composites reinforced with unidirectional layers show higher strength than the neat resin.

1095160,Experimental evaluation of the clamping pressure distribution in a PEM fuel cell using matrix-based piezoresistive thin-film sensors,2009,R Montanini and G Squadrito and G Giacoppo,,"XIX IMEKO World Congress Fundamental and Applied Metrology, Lisbon",,,,The achievement of a proper and uniform pressure distribution between the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and the bipolar plates of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is a key factor of stack design and assembly. Contact pressure levels are usually controlled by selecting an appropriate external clamping pressure on the endplates. Very few studies have been focused on the measurement of the contact pressure distribution within the fuel cell and its correlation with the applied external clamping torque. This study explores the possibility of using matrix-based piezoresistive thin-film sensors. to be placed between the MEA and the monopolar plate of a PEMFC. to investigate this correlation. Before embedding the sensor array into the fuel cell. it was validated for accuracy and repeatability by designing a pneumatic calibration device which allows to apply uniform static pressure levels over the whole sensor area. Preliminary results reported in this study showed that. as the clamping torque on the endplates is increased. the average pressure on the MEA remains almost constant but its distribution changes. The core area of the electrode becomes progressively more unloaded while average stresses on the gasket rise up. with significant stress concentration around the edge corners.,True,0YHTCSAAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,14,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.415.6754&rep=rep1&type=pdf,10631252604539095506,/scholar?cites=10631252604539095506,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.415.6754&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1095199,Energy balance of different internal reforming MCFC configurations,1997,S Freni and G Maggio,21,International journal of energy research,3,253-264,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. A Wiley Company,The internal reforming concept has been successfully integrated in molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) systems. In this paper. a comparison between the direct (DIR‐MCFC) and indirect internal reforming (IIR‐MCFC) configurations has been made. This approach. realized through a sensitivity analysis of suitable models. allows the advantages and disadvantages of the two configurations to be evaluated in terms of mass transfer balances and efficiencies. The temperature. steam/carbon ratio. electrical power and useful heat fraction have been found to be the most important parameters for optimizing the efficiencies of the two systems. Moreover. a detailed analysis of the technical problems presented by the two systems gives meaningful conclusions about their reliability for the production of electricity. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons.

The standard approach reflecting this idea is a translog specification-this is also the approach used by the majority of studies analyzing the substitutability of energy and capital. Yet. the substitutability between capital and energy and the source of discrepancies in the results still remain controversial. This paper offers a straightforward explanation for at least the divergent results provided by the translog studies: Using a translog approach reduces the issue of factor substitutability to a question of cost shares. Our review of translog studies demonstrates that this argument is empirically far more relevant than the distinction between time-series and panel studies being favored in the literature.

Using panel estimation methods and household travel diary data collected in Germany between 1997 and 2009. this study identifies the rebound effect in private transport by allowing for the possibility that fuel price elasticities--from which rebound effects can be derived--are asymmetric. This approach rests on empirical evidence suggesting that the response in individual travel demand to price increases is stronger than to decreases. We argue that such an asymmetric response would require referencing price elasticities derived from price decreases in order to identify the rebound effect. as it represents the response to a decrease in unit cost for car travel due to improved fuel efficiency. Failing to reject the null hypothesis of a symmetric price response. we alternatively estimate a reversible specification and obtain a rebound estimate for single-vehicle households being in the range of 46 to 70%. which is in line with an earlier German study by Frondel.

Despite the declining significance of hard coal production for the domestic labor market. the subsidies have continued to increase until the middle of the last decade. reaching a peak at €6.7 billion in 1996. While these subsidies have been continually shrinking since then. settling at €2.7 billion in 2005. it is very likely that hard coal support will be extended in Germany well into the next decade and even beyond. This article questions the main arguments raised by the proponents of hard coal subsidization in Germany and other EU countries. Most importantly. in addition to the drain these subsidies impose on public budgets. substantial opportunity costs are implied. leading funds away from alternative. more beneficial public investments.

Although the provision of information via energy audits is frequently asserted to be an effective means for governments to encourage the implementation of efficiency-enhancing renovations. empirical support for this assertion is tenuous at best. Apart from endogeneity issues with respect to receiving an audit. two other factors have complicated attempts to measure their effect: First. the nature of the information provided by the audit is typically unobserved. and. second. the response to this information may vary over households. Using household data from Germany. we address both sources of heterogeneity by estimating a random-parameter model of four retrofitting alternatives.

This paper critically assesses this legislation with respect to its economic and technological underpinnings. First. we argue that the reliance on targets based on per-kilometer emissions not only conceals the true cost of compliance and thereby stifles informed public discourse. but is also less cost-effective than alternative measures such as emissions trading. Second. the emission targets stipulated in this legislation are based on linear-regression methods that we demonstrate to be poorly justified and misleading.

Following a descriptive presentation that traces the German promotion of renewable energy technologies since 2000. we draw on two stated-preference surveys conducted in 2013 and 2015 that elicit the households' WTP for green electricity. Two models are estimated. one based on a closed-ended question framed around Germany's target of 35% renewable energy in electricity provision by 2020. and the other on an open-ended format that captures changes in WTP over time. To deal with the bias that typifies hypothetical responses. the models distinguish respondents according to whether they express definite certainty in their reported WTP. The results from both models reveal a strong contrast between the households' general acceptance of supporting renewable energy technologies and their own WTP for green electricity.,True,JNwidAMAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC,44,https://www.iaee.org/energyjournal/article/2912,3321707773797433734,/scholar?cites=3321707773797433734,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2912,0,0,0

Employing a hedonic price model whose specification is informed by machine learning techniques. our methodological approach provides insights into the sources of heterogeneity in treatment effects. We estimate an average treatment effect (ATE) of up to -7.1% for houses within a one-kilometer radius of a wind turbine. an effect that fades to zero at a distance of 8 to 9 km. Old houses and those in rural areas are affected the most. while home prices in urban areas are hardly affected.

Using a Monte Carlo simulation experiment. this paper compares the performance of six alternative methods commonly applied by regulators. Our results demonstrate that combination approaches. such as taking the maximum or the mean over DEA and SFA efficiency scores. have certain practical merits and might offer a useful alternative to strict reliance on a singular method. In particular. the results highlight that taking the maximum not only minimizes the risk of underestimation. but can also improve the precision of efficiency estimation.

In accord with numerous empirical studies. we find that the mean WTA value substantially exceeds the mean WTP bid. in our empirical example by a factor of 3.56.

Conversely. the WTA-WTP ratio increases to 3.81 among respondents who deem the setting unlikely.

While it is well-known that carbon taxes are effective in reducing emissions and can be made progressive. they remain fairly unpopular with German citizens. Consequently. best practice to build public support for them remains a relevant question for which there is no consensus. We obtain two major results: First. while green spending is more popular in general. it is significantly more popular among those who are pro-environment and trust the government. Second. when restricted to options for direct revenue redistribution. Germans prefer lump-sum payments over directing payments to the poorest or the most affected.

1095284,Negative price spikes at power markets: the role of energy policy,2016,Andreas Gerster,50,Journal of Regulatory Economics,3,271-289,Springer US,In Germany. substantial drops in wholesale power prices have become a regular phenomenon. While such price drops have far-reaching implications for the functioning of the power market. their underlying determinants remain poorly understood. To fill this gap. we propose a Markov regime-switching model to investigate low-price events at the European Power Exchange.

Firm Production and Competitiveness: Evidence from German Manufacturing,2019,Andreas Gerster and Stefan Lamp,,,,,Working Paper,Electricity taxes have strongly gained in importance over the past years. Intended as a corrective carbon tax or as an instrument to nance renewable energy sources (RES). electricity taxes can represent an important cost factor for the industry with potential negative implications for rm competitiveness. Based on comprehensive data from the German Manufacturing Census. this paper investigates the causal impact of an exemption from the RES levy. accounting for roughly 30% of the average industry electricity price. on plant-level electricity consumption. fuel input choices. and competitiveness indicators. Employing a matching di erence-in-di erences estimator. we nd that plants increase electricity consumption by about 5-7.5% in response to the exemption. We show that exempt plants substitute electricity for gas and reduce own electricity generation capacities. By contrast. we do not nd evidence that the exemption had an impact on competitiveness indicators. Investigating response heterogeneity. we nd that electricity-intensive plants adjust energy inputs more strongly in response to an exemption. Export-oriented rms respond less. which contrasts the policy objective to foster the competitiveness of exporters in international markets.,True,VP_IeWsAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,2,http://conference.iza.org/conference_files/environ_2019/lamp_s9253.pdf,3698153736314333504,/scholar?cites=3698153736314333504,,http://conference.iza.org/conference_files/environ_2019/lamp_s9253.pdf,0,0,0

Such so-called internalities are ubiquitous in many settings. including energy efficiency investments and the consumption of sin goods. such as cigarettes and sugar. In this paper. we use a mechanism design approach to characterize the optimal non-linear tax (or subsidy) for correcting behaviorally biased consumers. We demonstrate that market choices are informative about consumers' bias. which can be exploited for benevolent price discrimination via a non-linear tax schedule. We derive that such"" internality revelation"" depends on two sufficient statistics: the correlation between valuations and biases. as well as the signal-to-noise ratio of the bias. Furthermore. we find that there must be a minimum alignment of preferences among the designer and the consumer to ensure internality tax implementability.

This paper investigates the impact of a large electricity tax exemption on production levels. employment. and input choices in the German manufacturing industry. For two different policy designs. we show that exempted plants significantly increase their electricity use. This effect is considerably larger under a notched exemption policy. where passing an eligibility threshold yields inframarginal benefits. compared to a revised policy where these benefits have been largely removed.

1095292,Empirical Evaluations of Climate Policies,2017,Andreas Gerster,,,,,,Climate change from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is considered the greatest threat to a sustainable future of mankind (UN. 2014). Under a business-as-usual scenario. global temperatures are expected to rise by more than 4 C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. causing high risks of severe and irreversible global impacts. such as species extinction. more frequent and intense weather extremes. food insecurities. and rising sea levels (IPCC. 2014). To limit the risks of particularly profound changes. the recent Paris Agreement. reached at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). commits the international community to limit global warming to less than 2 C. Reaching this goal will involve substantial mitigation cost. estimated at around 1.7-4.8% of annual worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) over the course of the 21st century (IPCC. 2014).Given the large financial stakes involved. a central challenge for governments lies in the identification of cost-effective climate policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. To determine the effectiveness of a policy is inherently difficult. though: it is impossible to observe both the factual situation of a policy and its counterfactual. giving rise to the so-called “fundamental problem of causal inference”(Holland. 1986). To overcome this evaluation problem. recent methodological advances have introduced a wide range of impact evaluation methods that allow to identify the causal effects of policy interventions (Frondel and Schmidt. 2005; Imbens and Wooldridge. 2009).,True,VP_IeWsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,1,https://d-nb.info/1140223267/34,118493039768332631,/scholar?cites=118493039768332631,,https://d-nb.info/1140223267/34,0,0,0

Research is needed to relate such policies empirically to local-level decision making. both to evaluate their consequences and to contribute to an understanding of how cross-scalar dynamics drive processes of land-use change. This study examines the environmental impacts of a Mexican rural support program. referred to by its Spanish acronym.

1095310,The impact of urban form on automobile travel: disentangling causation from correlation,2007,Colin Vance and Ralf Hedel,34,Transportation,5,575-588,Springer US,A longstanding question within the field of transportation demand management is the strength of the relationship between urban form and mobility behavior. Although several studies have identified a strong correlation between these variables. there is as yet scant evidence to support policy interventions that target land use as a means of influencing travel. To the contrary. some of the more recent research has cast skepticism on the proposition that the relationship is causative. recognizing the possibility that households endogenously self-select themselves into communities that support their preferences for particular transportation modes. Focusing on individual automobile travel. the present study seeks to contribute to this line of inquiry by estimating econometric models on a panel of travel-diary data collected in Germany between 1996 and 2003.

Hypotheses from the model are tested on a data set that combines a time series of satellite imagery with data collected from a survey of farm households whose agricultural plots were geo‐referenced using a global positioning system (GPS).

Millions of poor households and those that are close to the poverty threshold are likely to suffer from the increase in electricity cost. Focusing on low-income households. this paper illustrates the distributional implications of Germany’s energy transition by investigating their electricity cost burden between 2006 and 2012. using data from the German Residential Energy Consumption Survey (GRECS).

Using panel estimation methods and household travel diary data collected in Germany between 1997 and 2009. this study identifies the rebound effect in private transport by allowing for the possibility that fuel price elasticities--from which rebound effects can be derived--are asymmetric. This approach rests on empirical evidence suggesting that the response in individual travel demand to price increases is stronger than to decreases. We argue that such an asymmetric response would require referencing price elasticities derived from price decreases in order to identify the rebound effect. as it represents the response to a decrease in unit cost for car travel due to improved fuel efficiency. Failing to reject the null hypothesis of a symmetric price response. we alternatively estimate a reversible specification and obtain a rebound estimate for single-vehicle households being in the range of 46 to 70%. which is in line with an earlier German study by Frondel.

Although the provision of information via energy audits is frequently asserted to be an effective means for governments to encourage the implementation of efficiency-enhancing renovations. empirical support for this assertion is tenuous at best.

Our results. which range between 57% and 67%. indicate a rebound that is substantially larger than obtained in other studies. calling into question the efficacy of policies targeted at reducing energy consumption via technological efficiency.,True,h26o7msAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,219,https://www.iaee.org/energyjournal/article/2281,10214478656935827637,/scholar?cites=10214478656935827637,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2281,0,0,0
1095331,Biodiesel: a new oildorado?,2007,Manuel Frondel and Jörg Peters,35,Energy Policy,3,1675-1684,Elsevier,Guaranteeing tax reductions and exemptions. the European governments intend to increase the share of biofuels in total EU fuel consumption to 5.75% by 2010. The financial support of this EU objective is frequently justified by expected positive environmental impacts. most notably the mitigation of climate change. and by favorable employment effects in the agricultural sector. This paper investigates the environmental and economic implications of the support of rapeseed-based biodiesel as a substitute for fossil diesel. Based on a survey of recent empirical studies. we find that the energy and greenhouse gas balances of this environmental strategy are clearly positive. Yet. it appears to be unclear whether the overall environmental balance is also positive. Most importantly. though. biodiesel is not a cost-efficient emission abatement strategy.

1095332,Promoting biofuels: Implications for developing countries,2008,Jörg Peters and Sascha Thielmann,36,Energy policy,4,1538-1544,Elsevier,Interest in biofuels is growing worldwide as concerns about the security of energy supply and climate change are moving into the focus of policy makers. With the exception of bioethanol from Brazil. however. production costs of biofuels are typically much higher than those of fossil fuels. As a result. promotion measures such as tax exemptions or blending quotas are indispensable for ascertaining substantial biofuel demand. With particular focus on developing countries. this paper discusses the economic justification of biofuel promotion instruments and investigates their implications. Based on data from India and Tanzania. we find that substantial biofuel usage induces significant financial costs.

Improved biomass cooking stoves are alleged to counteract these adverse effects. This paper evaluates take-up and impacts of low-cost improved stoves through a randomized controlled trial. The randomized stove is primarily designed to curb firewood consumption. but not smoke emissions. Nonetheless. we find considerable effects not only on firewood consumption. but also on smoke exposure and. consequently. smoke-related disease symptoms. The reduced smoke exposure results from behavioural changes in terms of increased outside cooking and a reduction in cooking time.

In this paper. we investigate electrification impacts on different indicators. We use household data that we collected in Rwanda in villages with and without electricity access. We account for self-selection and regional differences by using households from the electrified villages to estimate the probability to connect for all households – including those in the non-electrified villages.

The assumption underlying this goal is that electrification contributes to poverty alleviation in many regards. In recent years. a body of literature has emerged that widely confirms this positive poverty impact assumption. Most of these studies. however. are based on data from Asia and Latin America. This paper challenges the transferability of impact findings in the literature to the African context. Using a unique data set collected in various African countries. the paper suggests that impact expectations on income. education and health should be discounted considerably for Africa.

Improved cooking stove (ICS) technologies appear to be an obvious solution in many cases. Indeed we find that users of a very simple ICS in urban Burkina Faso need between 20 and 30 percent less firewood compared to traditional stoves. making the investment highly profitable. In spite of these high returns and great efforts made by the international community to disseminate ICSs. take-up rates are – similar to many other high-return innovations – strikingly low; in our case a mere 10 percent.

Using quantitative firm-level data on 200 micro-enterprises complemented by qualitative case studies we find that modern energy increases the importance of electricity-using capital and alters the sectoral distribution of economic activities. By contrast. we find no evidence for an expansionary effect of electrification on firm profits or worker remuneration. In fact. many entrepreneurs consider the direct gain from connecting to the grid to be small. Qualitative information. however. suggests that a positive indirect impact of electrification on firm performance is induced by the overall expansive effect electrification has on local demand.

They are subcomponents of “Access to modern energy services-Mozambique (AMES-M)”. an energy facilitation programme under the umbrella of the Dutch-German energy partnership “Energising Development”(EnDev) currently being implemented in 22 different countries.Within the electricity densification project “Household Service Connections at Matola Area (HHSC-M)”. households in certain peri-urban neighbourhoods of Matola located around 25 kilometres west of the country’s capital Maputo could apply for a subsidized connection at a roughly 95 percent discount. All 6.670 benefiting households have already been connected to the existing low-voltage grid of the government-owned energy corporation “Electricidade de Moçambique”(EdM). These household have been connected by a contractor in the three months preceding the survey. The second intervention is a. yet ongoing pico-hydro power project in rural Manica Province.

The analysis takes into account that capacity investment must be chosen under uncertainty about demand conditions and capacity availability. and that capacity as well as electricity generation may be sources of externalities. The main result is that generation subsidies should correspond to externalities of electricity generation (e.g.. greenhouse gas reductions). and investment subsidies should correspond to externalities of capacity (e.g.. learning spillovers). If only capacity externalities exist. then electricity generation should not be subsidized at all. Our results suggest that some of the most popular promotion instruments cause welfare losses.

To analyze this situation. we propose a sequential Nash bargaining solution: The government bargains with both lobbies simultaneously. Should this trilateral negotiation fail. it chooses one lobby for a bilateral negotiation. The disagreement point then is to bargain with the other lobby. Finally. should this second bilateral negotiation break down. the government chooses the welfare-maximizing policy.As long as cumulative extraction is low. such that stock-dependent extraction costs are also low and extraction profits are high. the environmental organization has a weak bargaining position. but it takes influence to reduce extraction.

If a present government expects its successor to value the social costs of fuel usage differently. this adds a strategic component to its investment considerations. We analyze this governmental time-inconsistency situation as a sequential game. In particular. we show how the expectation of a more conservative party taking over makes a “green” government choose an investment level that is inefficient. in that neither of the parties would prefer it to the investment level of a permanent green government. Under some circumstances. the opposition would even prefer the government definitely to stay in power: The gain from avoiding a strategic investment then outweighs the loss of not being able to regulate energy consumption.

They allow the use of public transport at no additional cost. I analyze such a scenario in a theoretical model as an example of a flat-rate ticket for public transport which is implemented by majority decision. The mandatory character of the ticket reduces transaction costs like marketing and ticket inspection. reducing the ticket price and thus the students’ commuting expenses. However. there is a countervailing effect. Students face and rationally expect zero marginal monetary commuting costs. so that new students choose a place of residence which is relatively far from the university.

We find that a regulatory agent who is more environmentalist than the government is rewarded for truthfully stating that the environmental impact of the regulated economic activity is low (and vice versa).

We characterize the equilibrium extraction path and the development of contribution payments in time. The latter relates to the development of the conflict of interest between profit-maximization and welfare-maximization.

1095365,Strategic choice of stock pollution: Why conservatives (appear to) turn green,2014,Achim Voß,,,66,,CAWM Discussion Paper,The public management of stock pollutants is an intertemporal problem; today's optimal choice takes the behavior of future governments into account. If a government expects a successor with different environmental preferences - for instance. if Conservatives expect green successors - it must choose strategically. I model this interaction in a two-period game in which the government of each period chooses consumption as a flow variable that adds to a stock of pollution. In this setting. I analyze how the prospect of losing political power changes the incumbent's policy choice. It is shown that both the prospect of a more conservative or of a greener successor reduce present consumption. This implies that losing power in the future makes a conservative government choose a compromise policy today - which may explain why in some countries. conservative governments seem to adopt green policies. By contrast. the expected loss of power makes a green government choose a policy that appears as a radicalization of their position.,True,YHwPxu4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/95874,10056875353905144660,/scholar?cites=10056875353905144660,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/95874/1/782419097.pdf,0,0,0

Hamburg: ZBW-Leibniz-Informationszentrum Wirtschaft,I analyze energy-efficiency policy as a prescription of a minimum-efficiency standard for energy-using household goods like cars. building insulation. and home appliances. Such a policy has two effects. At the intensive margin. a household that invests will choose a more efficient device. At the extensive margin. there will be more households that choose not to invest at all. Thus. additional to and different from rebound effects. energy-efficiency policy may have unintended consequences. I analyze the equilibrium effects of a minimum-efficiency standard. taking price adjustments and household heterogeneity into account. A moderate minimum-efficiency standard increases demand for efficiency-enhancing household capital goods. and reduces energy demand. More stringent policy is shown to be less effective or even counterproductive. For the case of a fixed supply of efficiency-enhancing capital. it is shown that minimum-efficiency standards increase equilibrium energy demand. Finally. I analyze which households benefit from minimum-efficiency standards and which ones lose. A standard induces investing households to expend more for household capital and less for energy.

One key priority is to schedule emergency surgeries as quickly as possible. because postponing them generally increases a patient’s risk of complications. In this paper. we consider the case that emergency surgeries are scheduled in one of the elective Operating Rooms (ORs). In this situation. emergency patients are operated once an ongoing elective surgery has finished. We denote these completion times of the elective surgeries by ‘break-in-moments’ (BIMs). The waiting time for emergency surgeries can be reduced by spreading these BIMs as evenly as possible over the day. This can be achieved by sequencing the surgeries in their assigned OR. such that the maximum interval between two consecutive BIMs is minimized.

The use of this surplus to produce hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis is called “Power-to-Gas” (P2G). This study investigates the potential use of electrolyzers in the electrical distribution grid as an alternative to a network expansion with cables.

To enable the evaluation of new concepts for the integration of RES-E. first the feed-in characteristics of photovoltaic. wind and biomass generators located in a distribution grid area and based on numerous measured feed-in data are studied in this thesis. The achieved insights from the feed-in profiles can be used for the dimensioning of grid assets. Furthermore. the results are useful for the evaluation of congestion management or for the dimensioning of storage assets in distribution grids. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail such that suitable storage characteristics for an introduction in the grid are determined. An economic approach is presented to derive break-even points for storage assets as a substitute to conventional reinforcements. For a case study from a real world low voltage grid with reinforcement needs. these break-even points are determined and the main influencing parameters are evaluated. A further important question in this context concerns the role DSOs may play with the operation of decentralized storage assets since several stakeholders may be interested in using the flexibility provided by these assets.

An increasing complexity constitutes a high computational load that can limit the scale of the energy system model. Hence. methods are sought to reduce this complexity. In this paper. we present a new 2-Level Approach to MILP energy system models that determines the system design through a combination of continuous and discrete decisions. On the first level. data reduction methods are used to determine the discrete design decisions in a simplified solution space. Those decisions are then fixed. and on the second level the full dataset is used to ex-tract the exact scaling of the chosen technologies. The performance of the new 2-Level Approach is evaluated for a case study of an urban energy system with six buildings and an island system based on a high share of renewable energy technologies. The results of the studies show a high accuracy with respect to the total annual costs. chosen system structure. installed capacities and peak load with the 2-Level Approach compared to the results of a single level optimization. The computational load is thereby reduced by more than one order of magnitude.

This transition is politically and socially supported to reduce the carbon footprint and/or enable the phasing out of nuclear power.Hereby. the operation of consumption and generation appliances in grids and market systems has become more complex since multiple stakeholders are involved. Furthermore. the different functions of the supply chain (eg production. transmission. distribution and selling of energy) follow different optimization objectives. Hence. the current market design is not appropriately reflected by an integrated view on the supply chain. A disaggregated perspective is required considering that different steering approaches for appliances by different stakeholders could be realized in the future (eg based on (global) prices or (local) signals).

Academia Sinica and International Chinese Statistical Association,Nonparametric smoothing under shape constraints has recently received much well-deserved attention. Powerful methods have been proposed for imposing a single shape constraint such as monotonicity and concavity on univariate functions. In this paper. we extend the monotone kernel regression method in Hall and Huang (2001) to the multivariate and multi-constraint setting. We impose equality and/or inequality constraints on a nonparametric kernel regression model and its derivatives. A bootstrap procedure is also proposed for testing the validity of the constraints. Consistency of our constrained kernel estimator is provided through an asymptotic analysis of its relationship with the unconstrained estimator. Theoretical underpinnings for the bootstrap procedure are also provided. Illustrative Monte Carlo results are presented and an application is considered.,True,il7-5R8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,138,https://www.jstor.org/stable/24310798,9714936818911067683,/scholar?cites=9714936818911067683,,https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/econ/rsrch/papers/archive/2012-08.pdf,0,0,0
1095424,Quasi-experiments and hedonic property value methods,2013,Christopher F Parmeter and Jaren C Pope,,,,3-66,Edward Elgar,Households’ valuations of environmental and urban amenities are often imbedded in the prices of transacted property. Property prices are one of the few market-based measures that can be used to reveal the values of many environmental and urban amenities that are not explicitly traded in their own markets. Researchers and policymakers are often interested in quantifying the value of a single amenity such as air quality or school quality. However. extracting the implicit price of one amenity from the overall prices in a property market can be a challenging task. The most commonly used method for estimating an implicit price from property values is called the ‘hedonic method’. This method was first used by Haas (1922). Waugh (1929) and Court (1939). was later popularized by Griliches (1971). and was given a welfare-theoretic interpretation by Rosen (1974).

The conventional approach has been to assume a linear growth process and then to proceed with investigating the relevant variables that determine cross‐country growth. This article questions the linearity assumption underlying the vast majority of such research and uses recently developed non‐parametric techniques to handle non‐linearities as well as select relevant variables.

However. empirical research often finds that the sign and significance of schooling depends on the sample of observations or the specification of the model. We use a non‐parametric local‐linear regression estimator and a non‐parametric variable relevance test to conduct a rigorous and systematic search for significance of mean years of schooling by examining five of the most comprehensive schooling databases. Contrary to a few recent articles that have identified significant nonlinearities between education and growth. our results suggest that mean years of schooling is not a statistically relevant variable in growth regressions.

We argue that differences in the potential productivity of a match (typically assumed to be known in the previous literature) generates a surplus between the minimum wage the worker is willing to accept and the maximum wage the firm is willing to offer for the job. Existence of this surplus leads to wage dispersion due to negotiating over the amounts extracted by each agent. Our objective is to estimate the surplus extracted by each firm-worker pair and the effect of the net extracted surplus on the wage. for each firm-worker pair using the two-tier stochastic frontier model. An empirical application finds that. on average. firms paid workers less than their expected productivity. More specifically. at the mean. the net effect of productivity uncertainty leads to equilibrium wages which are 3.33% below the expected …,True,il7-5R8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,104,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11123-008-0117-3,15869641894465396672,/scholar?cites=15869641894465396672,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subal_Kumbhakar/publication/23691431_The_effects_of_match_uncertainty_and_bargaining_on_labor_market_outcomes_Evidence_from_firm_and_worker_specific_estimates/links/00b4951fbe6d2f2646000000.pdf,0,0,0

However. the dearth of available statistical software which allows one to engage in a model averaging exercise is limited. It is common for consumers of these methods to develop their own code. which has obvious appeal. However. canned statistical software can ameliorate one's own analysis if they are not intimately familiar with the nuances of computer coding.

If buyers are not fully informed of the lowest price available in the market they end up paying a price higher than if they had full information. Similarly. if sellers are not fully informed about the highest price they could charge. they too suffer by receiving a price lower than had they had full information.

1095446,Sustainable food consumption: an overview of contemporary issues and policies,2013,Lucia Reisch and Ulrike Eberle and Sylvia Lorek,9,,2,7-25,Routledge,Contemporary food production and consumption cannot be regarded as sustainable and raises problems with its wide scope involving diverse actors. Moreover. in the face of demographic change and a growing global population. sustainability problems arising from food systems will likely become more serious in the future. For example. agricultural production must deal with the impacts of climate change. increasingly challenging land-use conflicts. and rising health and social costs on both individual and societal levels. The unsustainability of current arrangements arises from the industrialization and globalization of agriculture and food processing. the shift of consumption patterns toward more dietary animal protein. the emergence of modern food styles that entail heavily processed products. the growing gap on a global scale between rich and poor. and the paradoxical lack of food security amid an abundance of …,True,CLExvBcAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,470,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15487733.2013.11908111,15084834396154901821,/scholar?cites=15084834396154901821,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15487733.2013.11908111,0,0,0

The study indicates that addictive buying is clearly one kind of addiction which may be substituted by other addictions. may take the place of another addiction. or even alternate with other forms of addiction. At the same time. there is substantial evidence that there are special key experiences to which the propensity to addictive buying can be traced. Addictive buyers have been subjected to a specific form of distortion of autonomy: They have felt that for parents. relatives. or neighbours. material goods (money. property. consumer goods) seemed to be more relevant and more important than they themselves.

How. for example. do consumers choose between environmentally friendly products or services and alternatives that are potentially damaging to the environment but less expensive? The answer may well depend on the default rule. Indeed. green default rules may be a more effective tool for altering outcomes than large economic incentives. The underlying reasons include the powers of suggestion. inertia. and loss aversion.

Key themes associated with the term “organic” and its meaning. as determined by consumers. are explored and the role of labelling and regulatory authorities considered. Focus groups in five countries (UK. Germany. Spain.

Many consumers were unsure. even sceptical about the concept of organic farmed salmon and display a large amount of distrust in the regulatory process.

While electrification interventions are often expected to reduce poverty through productive uses for income generating purposes. the reality in rural usage patterns looks different: Electricity is often used for lighting and entertainment devices only. It is particularly lighting with its implications for security and convenience that explains the high importance beneficiaries assign to electrification. Against this background. this paper probes into the effects of Solar Home System electricity usage on lighting consumption and activities after nightfall using cross-sectional household-level data from rural Senegal. We apply a new matching algorithm to control for a possible self-selection into Solar Home System ownership and find substantially higher lighting usage and study time after nightfall of school children.

The country has no significant fossil fuel resources. Petroleum product consumption is entirely dependent on imports. The country’s hydroelectric potential is estimated at 100 megawatt (MW) in five identified sites. This is considerable for African standards. but the required investment is huge. Two hydropower plants have been developed although the energy production is volatile due to erratic rainfall conditions. Total energy imports. representing between 10 and 20 percent of the country's gross imports over the past ten years. are now increasing (World Bank 2007).Therefore. it is not surprising that the electrification rate amounts to mere 18 percent for the total population. 40 in urban areas and only 3 percent in rural areas. Per capita consumption is 44 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in Burkina Faso. compared to 100 kWh in Cameroon and 270 kWh in Ivory Coast. for example (6.694 kWh in the Netherlands).

It is hypothesized that economic and human development are difficult without electricity access. Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world and the country's huge geographical extent and low population density makes infrastructure development such as electrification a particularly difficult exercise. The electrification rate is extremely low at around 46 percent in urban and 4 percent in rural areas. The access to reliable modern energy has become one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (UN 2014) and the international community has embarked on a historical mission through the United Nations initiative Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) that strives to provide electricity to everybody by 2030.

The initiative is the first to be jointly chaired by the UN Secretary-General and the president of the World Bank Group. underscoring the emphasis placed on energy access. The current challenge for the scientific community is to support operationalizing this universal access goal. A milestone in this endeavour is the multi-tier framework promoted in the recently published Global Tracking Framework (World Bank. ESMAP and IEA 2013). This multi-tier framework is intended to go beyond binary measures of energy access to capture aspects like the quantity and quality of electricity supplied. the efficiency. safety and convenience of household cookstoves and access to energy services in local enterprises and social infrastructure. This framework is the fruit of lively debates that helped to deepen understanding of energy access as a complex multidimensional construct. It is widely recognized that energy access is a process that undergoes different phases and levels. conceptually organized into various ‘tiers’ of access to and use of electricity and modern cooking.Hence. much effort has been put into capturing the intricacies and complexities of the path that stretches from people’s deprivation of their basic energy needs to a state of “vibrant and sustainable social and economic growth”(Bazilian and Pielke 2013) empowered by modern energy access.

The EnDev Kenya intervention seeks to establish and enhance self-sustaining markets for modern energy technologies in rural areas by training and mentoring individuals on how to run small businesses in improved cook stoves or pico-solar technologies. The EnDev Kenya programme was established in 2006 and is composed of three core components: improved cook stoves. pico-solar and biogas. This report focuses on the first two components. Both are implemented by GIZ in cooperation with SNV who currently operate in 21 of the 47 counties in Kenya. The improved cook stoves component promotes the sustainable production. marketing. installation and use of the so-called ‘Jiko Kisasa Stoves’ and ‘Rocket Stoves’. According to the EnDev monitoring system. over 1.9 million improved cook stoves are in use by mid-2015. effectively reaching over 4.5 million people. The solar component was launched in 2012 and promotes the use of small solar lighting systems that have been quality approved by the Lighting Africa Initiative. Up to June 2015. over 120.000 pico-PV lanterns have been sold by entrepreneurs cooperating with the programme.

These activities were funded as part of the first phase of the German-Dutch Energy Partnership Energising Development (EnDev). an output oriented program that aims at providing modern energy to 6.1 million people in 21 countries. The objective of this study is to examine the effective electricity usage of households that have connected to an MHP. ie what those households do with electricity and to what extent this changes the households’ life.For this purpose. 413 households that are connected to an MHP have been interviewed between September and November 2010 by RWI. the subcontractor Entec that carries out the implementation of the project. and local organizations. The household interviews are based on a structured questionnaire that covers virtually all socio-economic living conditions of the household and its members with a particular focus on energy usage.

Because of the sequential nature of negotiations of the overall budget. the allocation also has to follow a sequential process. If power generators anticipate that their current behaviour will affect future allowance allocation. then this can distort today's decisions.

Otherwise the uncovered price risk increases financing costs. reduces equilibrium investment levels. distorts technology choice towards less capital-intensive generation and reduces consumer utility. We observe insufficient levels of long-term contracts in existing markets. possibly because retail companies are not credible counter-parties if their final customers can switch easily between them. With a consumer franchise. retailers can sign long-term contracts. but this solution comes at the expense of retail competition.

During 2008 a number of investigations were conducted on the potential for carbon leakage from specific energy-intensive sectors. and some remedies were explored.The debate about carbon leakage. ie the possibility that unilateral carbon pricing could induce tradeexposed. energy-intensive industries to replace domestic production by imports. or to relocate production to foreign countries. was at the heart of the policy process that resulted in the EU Emissions Trading Directive of 2008. The concern was that EU carbon reductions would not fully contribute to global emission reductions and the effectiveness of the EU climate strategy would be undermined. While the EU ETS Directive foresees free allocation of emission rights for “sectors at risk of carbon leakage”. the project has paid special attention to the adjustment of carbon costs at the border as an alternative. This touches on a number of legal. practical and political issues in trade and climate policy.,True,2k-E0QIAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC,172,http://193.51.120.252/IMG/pdf/cs_tackling_leakage_report_final.pdf,10903898496663120503,/scholar?cites=10903898496663120503,,http://193.51.120.252/IMG/pdf/cs_tackling_leakage_report_final.pdf,0,0,0

This has a technical reason but can be exaggerated in the presence of market power. When there is much wind smaller amounts of conventional generation technologies are required. and prices are lower. while at times of little wind prices are higher. This effect reflects the value of different generation technologies to the system. But under conditions of market power. conventional generators with market power can further depress the prices if they have to buy back energy at times of large wind output and can increase prices if they have to sell additional power at times of little wind output. This greatly exaggerates the effect. Forward contracting does not reduce the effect.

To incorporate these intermittent sources. a power market needs to be flexible enough to accommodate short-term forecasts and quick turn transactions. This flexibility is particularly valuable with respect to wind energy. where wind forecast uncertainty decreases significantly in the final 24 hours before actual generation. Therefore. current designs of intraday and balancing markets need to be altered to make full use of the flexibility of the transmission system and the different generation technologies to effectively respond to increased uncertainty.

We characterize optimal cap-and-trade regulation with a price cap and a price floor. and compare it to the special cases of pure taxation and a simple emissions cap. Innovation shifts the tradeoff between price- and quantity-based instruments towards quantity-based emissions trading schemes. More specifically. an increase in innovation effectiveness lowers the optimal emissions cap. and leads to relaxed price controls unless the slope of the marginal environmental damage curve is small. Because of the decrease in the emissions cap. innovation in abatement technologies can lead to a higher expected carbon price. so as to provide sufficient incentives for private R&D investments.

Over a three-day period twenty-two analysts and practitioners of public participation from the United States and Europe came together to address one of the most pressing issues in contemporary environmental politics: How can environmental policies be designed in a way that achieves both effective protection of nature and an adequate representation of public values? In other words. how can we make the environmental decision process competent and fair? All the invited scholars from academia. international research institutes. and governmental agencies agreed on one fundamental principle: For environmental policies to be effective and legitimate. we need to involve the people who are or will be affected by the outcomes of these policies. There is no technocratic solution to this problem. Without public involvement. environmental policies are doomed to fail. The workshop was preceded by a joint effort by the three editors to develop a framework for evaluating different models of public participation in the environmental policy arena.

1095532,Three decades of risk research: accomplishments and new challenges,1998,Ortwin Renn,1,Journal of risk research,1,49-71,Taylor & Francis,Risk research over the last three decades has been focused on the development of methods of and procedures for risk analysis and risk management. As a consequence of this research. risk management agencies have been trying to make risk assessments a routine operation for evaluating different hazards. chemical agents. or technologies. The problem with the worldwide routinization of the risk assessment methodology is. however. that formal analysis may obscure the conceptual foundations and limitations of this method and may induce a false degree of certainty when dealing with potential side-effects of human actions and interventions. One of the main tasks of the risk community should be to emphasize the necessity of integrated risk assessment and the development of innovative risk management strategies that build upon the insights of the natural. technical and social sciences.

1095533,On risk defined as an event where the outcome is uncertain,2009,Terje Aven and Ortwin Renn,12,Journal of risk research,1,1-11,Taylor & Francis,In the social sciences. two prevailing definitions of risk are: (1) risk is a situation or event where something of human value (including humans themselves) is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain; (2) risk is an uncertain consequence of an event or an activity with respect to something that humans value. According to these definitions. risk expresses an ontology (a theory of being) independent of our knowledge and perceptions. In this paper. we look closer into these two types of definitions. We conclude that the definitions provide a sound foundation for risk research and risk management. but compared to common terminology. they lead to conceptual difficulties that are incompatible with the everyday use of risk in most applications. By considering risk as a state of the world. we cannot conclude. for example. about the risk being high or low. or compare different options with respect to risk.

What human beings perceive as threats to their well‐being is influenced by their values. attitudes. social influences. and cultural identity. This article introduces the framework of social amplification of risk. which integrates the technical assessment and the social experience of risk. This viewpoint proposes that events pertaining to hazards interact with psychological. social. institutional. and cultural processes in ways that can heighten or attenuate individual and social perceptions of risk and shape risk behavior.

Five groups of seeds characterized by a different exposure times (1. 2. 5. 10 and 15 minutes) as well as untreated seeds—control were used. Pre-sowing plasma stimulation of seeds improved germination parameters such as: germination capacity and germination energy for all tested groups relative to control. The highest germination parameters were obtained for seeds stimulated with plasma for the exposure times of 2 and 5 min. The analysis of the contact surface angle indicated the decrease of its’ mean values upon seed stimulation while no statistical effects were observed. Analysis of the SEM scans revealed the increase in seed pattern intensity which could be attributed to removing of the surface parts of cuticle possibly covered with wax upon short time—2 and 5 min plasma treatment. Such a phenomenon can act similarly to mechanical scarification of seeds. Longer exposure of seeds to plasma resulted in affecting the deeper zone of cuticle and damage or fracture of some parts of the cuticle. Lower germination parameters of seeds upon longer exposure times to plasma may indicate mechanical damage of the seeds.,True,Yt5rr5QAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC,31,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194349,7531849923908125168,/scholar?cites=7531849923908125168,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194349,0,0,0

Additionally. an attempt to explain the mechanism of decrease in the strength of grain under thermal processing was undertaken. Based on the results obtained. we reached the conclusion that thermal processing with infrared (IR) radiation leads to a decrease in wheat grain compressive resistance. The range of compressive resistance changes depends on the temperature and the time that the wheat grain is exposed to IR radiation: The higher the temperature and the longer the processing time. the lower grain compressive resistance. The lowest values of compressive force were recorded following the process carried out at 180 °C for 150 s.

The aim of this work was to assess the use of flaxseed components for pasta production. We examined the chemical composition and cooking quality. at different contents of flaxseed flour (FF) and flaxseed cake (FC). added for pasta processing. The analysis showed that the addition of flaxseed components to the dough caused a substantial difference in the International Commission on Illumination color model (CIE) parameter. compared to control samples. The samples of pasta with FF and FC were darker. redder. and less yellow than the control. The minimum cooking time for the enriched pasta was longer than that for the control pasta. although cooking losses were lower. The increasing content of flaxseed components did not significantly change the weight and volume increase index. The enrichment of pasta with 23% FF and 17% FC yielded good quality pasta. The results of the chemical composition of the flaxseed-enriched pasta indicate considerably enhanced nutritional quality. particularly the levels of protein. fat. and dietary fiber of the pasta. without affecting its quality. Moreover. flaxseed cake can be an important source of nutritional ingredients for pasta production. although it is a by-product of the oil cold pressing technology.

Five groups of seeds characterized by a different exposure times (1. 2. 5. 10 and 15 minutes) as well as untreated seeds—control were used. Pre-sowing plasma stimulation of seeds improved germination parameters such as: germination capacity and germination energy for all tested groups relative to control. The highest germination parameters were obtained for seeds stimulated with plasma for the exposure times of 2 and 5 min. The analysis of the contact surface angle indicated the decrease of its’ mean values upon seed stimulation while no statistical effects were observed. Analysis of the SEM scans revealed the increase in seed pattern intensity which could be attributed to removing of the surface parts of cuticle possibly covered with wax upon short time—2 and 5 min plasma treatment. Such a phenomenon can act similarly to mechanical scarification of seeds. Longer exposure of seeds to plasma resulted in affecting the deeper zone of cuticle and damage or fracture of some parts of the cuticle.

The aim of this study was to assess the quality of rapeseed oils supplemented with Spanish sage and cress oils. Seven oil mixtures consisting of 70% of rapeseed oil and 30% of sage and/or cress oil were prepared for the analyses. The oil mixtures were analyzed to determine their acid value. peroxide value. oxidative stability. and fatty acid composition. In terms of the acid value and the peroxide value. all mixtures met the requirements for cold-pressed vegetable oils. The enrichment of the rapeseed oil with α-linolenic acid-rich fats resulted in a substantially lower ratio of n-6 to n-3 acids in the mixtures than in the rapeseed oil. The mixture of the rapeseed oil with the sage and cress oils in a ratio of 70: 10: 20 exhibited higher oxidative stability than the raw materials used for enrichment and a nearly 20% α-linolenic acid content. The oils proposed in this study can improve the ratio of n-6: n-3 acids in modern diets. Additionally. mixing the cress seed oils with rapeseed oil and chia oil resulted in a reduction in the content of erucic acid in the finished product.

In case of analysis of mutual nature of relationship between the service quality and customer satisfaction constructs the author has concentrated on three main concepts showing that interrelations (because there is a lack of consensus concerning the specification of the service quality-satisfaction relationship). First. according to some authors (e.g. Parasuraman et al.. 1985. 1988; Cronin. Taylor. 1992; Rust. Oliver. 1994; Anderson. Fornell. 1994). service quality has been identified as an antecedent to satisfaction. However. some researches contradict that and claim that customer satisfaction is an antecedent of service quality (e.g. Carman. 1990; Bitner. 1990; Bolton. Drew. 1991; Bitner. Hubert. 1994). Then the third alternative conceptualization of the service quality - satisfaction relationship suggest that neither satisfaction nor service quality may be antecedent to the other (e.g. Teas. 1993; McAlexander et al.. 1994; lacobucci et al.. 1995; Dabholkar 1995) - it means that perceived service quality is both an antecedent and a consequence of satisafaction.

Since its creation. this method has been the object of various criticisms raised by a number of authors. Therefore. this paper presents some problems identifies and discussed in the literature. SERVQUAL has been extensively criticised on both theoretical and operational grounds (Buttle; 1996). Other authors claim that the difficulties associated with the SERVQUAL measure that are identified in the literaure can be grouped in four main categories: (1) the use of difference or gap scores. (2) poor predective and convergent validity. (3) the ambiguous definition of the ""expectations"" construct and (4) unstable dimensionality (Van Dyke et al.; 1999). Besides the discussed weaknesses.

For the above reasons. it is so important to assess the capability of monitored processes. and shaping. analyzing and controlling the capability of processes is an important aspect of managing an organization that uses a process approach to management. The use of an appropriate method to analyze the course of production processes is a necessity imposed by quality standards. eg. ISO 9001: 2015. That is why it is so important to propose a quick and low-cost method of assessing production processes. For this purpose. a method of assessing the capability of the manufacturing process using bootstrap analysis was used. The article presents the analysis of inherent properties of the production process based on the results of measurements of the characteristic features of the process or the characteristics of the manufactured products (process variables) for the shafts with grooves. The main goals of the work are to develop a procedure for determining process capability based on the bootstrap method. including criteria for the classification of production process capability; to develop the criterion values for confidence intervals of production process capability; as well as to demonstrate the practical application of bootstrap analysis in manufacturing.

A five-level Likert scale was applied to evaluate statements; respondents were asked to specify which level on the scale best corresponded with their view on each statement. In order to identify variables differentiating between specific groups of respondents. the data gathered from questionnaires was subject to a type of statistical analysis called discriminant function analysis. The aim of the study was to analyse links between the place of living and evaluation of the natural environment. certain factors affecting environmental awareness. and willingness to undertake environment-friendly actions by people living in Eastern Poland. The discriminant function analysis enabled categorization of opinions and attitudes of the respondents according to their place of living. indicating that their diversified nature results from the place they inhabit. The analysis revealed that a grouping variable used to categorize places of living has statistically significant discriminatory power.

Being in the middle of Europe and energy-rich countries of Central Asia. it can be an energy corridor between these two regions. It can import gas from a number of countries and diversify its sources. This situation may also provide motivation for a competitive gas market. The recent reform in the market. which began in 2001. was an attempt to strengthen the natural gas market to this end. However. the reform has not worked out as expected so far. This article discusses recent restructuring efforts in the Turkish natural gas market.

1095633,Hayek on tacit knowledge,2010,Fuat Oguz,6,Journal of Institutional Economics,2,145,Cambridge University Press,This paper discusses the place of ‘tacit knowledge’in Hayek’s writings. How did Hayek understand tacit knowledge? How did his understanding change through time? I address these questions and follow the change in Hayek’s works from skills and techniques of thought in the 1930s to the use of ‘tacit knowledge’in the1960s. Hayek uses Polanyi’s concept in many writings. but remains short of approving its implications. The paper emphasizes that while Hayek was quite aware of the differences between tacit knowing and knowing-how. he was not keen to stress the divergence. In the end. I offer some potential explanations for this preference.[I] t is entirely consistent. on the one hand. to deny that ‘wholes’ which are intuitively perceived by the scientist may legitimately figure in his explanations and. on the other. to insist that the perception of such wholes by the persons whose interactions are the object of investigation must form a datum for scientific analysis.(FA Hayek. 1967: 54),True,I2sJGcEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,36,https://www.academia.edu/download/51130945/Hayek_on_tacit_knowledge20161231-14998-1hzi13u.pdf,18087601148162645233,/scholar?cites=18087601148162645233,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51130945/Hayek_on_tacit_knowledge20161231-14998-1hzi13u.pdf,0,0,0

1095637,The political economy of regulation in Turkey,2011,Tamer Çetin and Fuat Oğuz,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,The Political Economy of Regulation in Turkey brings together leading international scholars and experts on Turkey and regulatory reform to provide essential information on the recent Turkish experience and its relation to competition policy. After the 1980 liberalization reform. Turkey tried to introduce competition in many industries. but network industries have remained as monopolies. At the end of the 1990s. regulatory reform was initiated and independent regulatory agencies have been established by the government. Comprehensive discussions of these network industries. in particular airlines. electricity. natural gas. telecommunications and environment regulations. are offered. The contributors inquire how economic theory and historical analyses can enlighten the character of market processes and the role for government action in these industries. and the contributions shed light on the very recent changes in the regulatory structure and important legal cases that shape the future of regulated industries. This book discusses these issues in an international perspective and relates the Turkish experience to other similar countries. such as in Eastern Europe and Central America. This book serves as a useful guide to those who want to understand major changes in Turkey and regulatory reforms in other emerging markets. making it of interest to researchers and PhD students concerned with regulatory economics. the Turkish economy. and economic policy in emerging markets.,True,I2sJGcEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,25,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=U8aG2wEUOhoC&oi=fnd&pg=PR3&dq=info:jKSfDS3aV9EJ:scholar.google.com&ots=UR2HQgECfc&sig=l8r0cKXm2TYN8U0TJEHz7xRq9_Y,15084765363937715340,/scholar?cites=15084765363937715340,,,0,0,0

Questions about jurisdictional authority over competition policy are far from settledWhat role should NCAs play in regulated industries? Should we see NRAs and NCAs as complements or substitutes?

A critical discussion and evidence from the Turkish electricity generation market,2014,Fuat Oğuz and K Ali Akkemik and Koray Göksal,30,,,381-387,Pergamon,Electricity markets have undergone regulatory reforms since the early 1980s around the world. Technical analyses of these reforms usually pay lip service to the influence of politics over regulatory processes. Existing studies examine certain aspects of the market such as demand. pricing. and efficiency. and they touch upon political issues only passingly when economic models cannot provide sufficient explanation. This approach problematically takes politics as an ad hoc variable. This study shows that electricity is intrinsically a ‘political good’ and argues that any meaningful reform effort should take institutions as the starting point rather than a residual. The argument that politics has to be an endogenous variable in any model aspiring to explain behavior in electricity markets is demonstrated in the paper.

In this transformation of public policy toward universal services. political preferences take precedence over economic considerations. Turkey provides a good case in point.

While. some countries prefer ‘light handed regulation’ by competition authorities. others grant substantial power to independent regulatory agencies. Turkey followed the liberalization wave in electricity with a regulatory reform in 2001. Recently. a slight shift of tide has appeared in previously liberalized markets. Electricity markets are the forefront example of this change of course. A similar trend is apparent in Turkey as well. Increasing pressures on prices and excess demand have created more reasons for active government involvement.

Martin Crowe wrote a doctoral thesis that reviewed much of that literature in 1944. The debate revolved around about 15 issues. Over the centuries. three main views evolved on the topic. But the business ethics literature has paid scant attention to this issue. perhaps because of the belief that tax evasion is always unethical. This paper reports the results of an empirical study of opinion in Turkey. A survey of 176 Turkish accounting practitioners was conducted to determine the extent of their agreement or disagreement with the 15 main issues that Crowe (1944) identified plus three more recent issues. The arguments that have been made over the centuries to justify tax evasion were ranked to determine which arguments are strongest and which are weakest.

A questionnaire survey was administrated to 375 male and 28 female self-employed taxpayers. In this paper. two dimensions of religiosity. namely interpersonal and intrapersonal religiosity. were studied. Factor analysis and ordinary least squares regression methods were used for data analyses. The results of the study illustrate that general religiosity has a statistically positive impact on both voluntary and enforced tax compliance. When we consider the dimensions of religiosity. only intrapersonal religiosity appears to be a significant contributor only to voluntary tax compliance. Nevertheless. interpersonal religiosity has no significant statistical effect on both voluntary and enforced tax compliance.

These two groups were selected on the premise that their views represented the perceptions of two very different cultures. which has not been investigated in previous studies. The survey instrument required students to indicate their level of agreeableness to 18 general statements representing various scenarios in the socio-economic environment. The statements in the survey reflected the three main viewpoints regarding the ethics of tax evasion which have emerged from the literature to date.

But while financial decisions often trigger strong emotional responses. little is known about the relation between taxpayers’ emotions and their compliance choices. We hypothesize that emotions mediate the relationship between the perception of tax authorities and intended tax compliance. In a scenario-based experiment with 411 self-employed Turkish taxpayers. we find that highlighting authorities’ enforcement capacity (i.e. high power) induces negative emotions while elevating enforced compliance and the readiness to evade. Trust. on the other hand. reduces negative emotions and raises positive feelings. which are associated with intentions to comply voluntarily. Moreover. a combination of high power and high trust reduces negative feelings and increases intentions to comply …,True,hFTyNMIAAAAJ:MpfHP-DdYjUC,15,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818818301455,15926476142065280845,/scholar?cites=15926476142065280845,,,0,0,0

Bu tür sorunlar ulaşım faaliyeti esnasında oluşan özel maliyetlerin sosyal maliyetlere eşit olmamasından kaynaklanmaktadır. Yani bireyler ulaşım faaliyeti esnasında meydana getirdikleri maliyetlerin tamamına katlanmamakla birlikte oluşturdukları maliyetlerin bir kısmını dışsal maliyet şeklinde topluma yansıtmaktadırlar. Kentiçi ulaşımın negatif dışsallıkları olarak ifade edilen bu sorunun önlenmesine yönelik herhangi bir müdahalenin olmaması gelecekte daha büyük ve karmaşık sorunların meydana gelmesine neden olacaktır. Bu çalışmanın amacı kentiçi ulaşım sonucu oluşan negatif dışsallıkların boyutlarını ortaya koymak ve söz konusu dışsallıkların içselleştirme sürecinde uygulanan yöntemlerin sürdürülebilir ulaşım anlayışı açısından değerlendirmesini yapmaktır. Bu amaç doğrultusunda öncelikli olarak dışsallık kavramına ilişkin açıklamalara yer verilmiş olup. bu açıklamalar ışığında kentiçi ulaşım dışsallıkları incelenmiştir.

Efforts are being made all over the world to increase the sustainability of development patterns.  In nations with more advanced economies. particular attention is being paid to the critical roles played by transportation. land use. and activity systems.  This paper reviews current thinking about sustainable transportation as part of a broader strategy of transportation and land use planning for sustainability.Strategies for increasing transportation sustainability include demand management. operations management. pricing policies. vehicle technology improvements. clean fuels. and integrated land use and transportation planning.  In the past. planning and implementation of such strategies has been slow and spotty. deterred by the complexities of the underlying issues along with uncertainties about the magnitude and timing of impacts. the efficacy of available courses of action. and the consequences of action or inaction.  Recently. however. a new interest in actively pursuing these strategies has emerged.

In turn. changes in transportation demand influence total passenger vehicle emissions to which populations are exposed. Population density can also influence the fraction of total emissions that are inhaled by the exposed urban population. Equations are presented that describe these relationships for an idealized representation of an urban area. Using analytic solutions to these equations. we investigate the effect of three changes in urban population and urban land area (infill. sprawl. and constant-density growth) on per capita inhalation intake of primary pollutants from passenger vehicles.

VMT fees. and emissions fees. Advanced travel demand models were used to analyze these measures for the Los Angeles. Bay Area. San Diego. and Sacramento metropolitan areas. The analyses indicate that transportation pricing measures could effectively relieve congestion. lower pollutant emissions. reduce energy use. and raise revenues. For example. a combination of congestion pricing. employee parking charges. a 50 cent gas tax increase. and mileage and emissions feeds would reduce VMT and trips by 5-7 percent and cut fuel use and emissions by 12-20 percent. varying by region. Because auto use and its impacts are quite inelastic to price. sizable increases in revenue can be obtained with relatively little effect on travel. conversely price increases must be large to obtain sizable reductions in travel and its externalities.Citizen reactions to prototype transportation pricing measures were explored in focus groups. and feedback from public officials and private organizations was obtained through meetings and interviews. First reactions were skeptical. but many were more favorably inclined after considering alternatives to pricing. Public acceptance would be increased by earmarking revenues for transportation improvements and providing independent oversight of revenue collection and expenditure.Federal and state laws govern and in some cases restrict the implementation of pricing strategies. and these and other institutional and administrative issues would have to be resolved before proceeding with …,True,UmFMBmsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,87,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/723002kt,11446015397552554477,/scholar?cites=11446015397552554477,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt723002kt/qt723002kt.pdf,0,0,0

VERSION 1.0,1993,Greig Harvey and Elizabeth Deakin,,,,,,Recent changes in the context of transportation planning have increased the importance of regional transportation analysis methods. In particular. the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set forth requirements for detailed planning and analysis which apply to many states and metropolitan areas. This Manual. prepared for the National Association of Regional Councils as part of NARC's Clean Air Project. was designed to help transportation planning agencies. including metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs). state departments of transportation. and other entities. respond to the issues raised in carrying out transportation modeling for air quality planning efforts. The Manual reviews transportation modeling today. focusing primarily on travel demand forecasting as it is practiced by regional agencies. and suggests strategies for responding to specific analysis needs and for overcoming common problems. The emphasis is on identifying issues which MPOs should consider in reviewing their models. and on recommending sound options for addressing such issues in accordance with local objectives and resource availability. Several of the topics covered in the Manual are in a state of flux (eg. analysis procedures for conformity determinations). As a result. the Manual is in loose leaf notebook format to facilitate periodic revisions and updates. The Manual is organized in five chapters. as follows:(1) Introduction;(2) The Emerging Context of MPO Analysis;(3) Current Analysis Practice;(4) Matching Analysis Tools with Analysis Needs; and (5) Looking to the Future.

The restrictions prohibit drivers from using their vehicles one weekday per week on the basis of the license plate number. Using the 2010 Beijing Household Travel Survey data. we find that driving restrictions have significant effects on auto trip frequency and thus vehicle miles traveled. suggesting substitution toward other modes. We also find evidence of the differential effects across subgroups of drivers. This suggests a variation in willingness to pay for auto use. which is not addressed by the restrictions. Three adaptation mechanisms–substitution toward unrestricted hours/days. having access to an unrestricted vehicle. and noncompliance–have been at work that mitigate the policy’s effect.

1095726,Land use and transportation planning in response to congestion problems: A review and critique,1989,Elizabeth Deakin,1237,Transportation Research Record,,77-86,,Concerns over traffic congestion are producing an upsurge of interest in coordinating land development and transportation. This paper reviews land use and transportation planning at the local government level and assesses planning and policy issues raised by various strategies being utilized to address congestion problems. At the local level transportation and land use planning often are carried out as largely separate functions. This separation reflects differences in education and training of the planners responsible for land use and the engineers responsible for transportation and occurs in part because many transportation facilities and services are provided by state and regional rather than local agencies. One result is that transportation and land use plans are rarely coordinated and often are inconsistent. Such inconsistencies were less of a concern in the past. when the tradition of providing transportation services on demand lessened the need for detailed plan coordination. Today. however. shrinking revenues. escalating costs. and concerns about social and environmental impacts have combined to constrain state highway building; financial problems and difficulties in attracting riders have deterred transit expansion. Consequently. it is no longer possible to rely on state and regional transportation agencies to build a way out of congestion problems. and local governments are having to shoulder greater responsibility for transportation. Three approaches increasingly are being used by local governments as responses to congestion.

Few studies have examined the conceptual and empirical issues involved in improving port sustainability. although port sustainability issues have recently been discussed with some urgency in the goods movement sector. This paper sets out a conceptual model of port sustainability. presents and examines multiple concepts of supply chains surrounding port activity. and identifies both institutional barriers and supply chain bottlenecks. Three different supply chain concepts for seaports are discussed: physical infrastructure chain. economic value chain. and institutional chain. Rather than a narrow focus on an individual port's operational aspects. broader. more systematic supply chain …,True,UmFMBmsAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC,36,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3141/2166-02,4773987188779947743,/scholar?cites=4773987188779947743,,,0,0,0

In the European countries. reducing greenhouse gases has been the initial motivation for most sustainable transportation initiatives. but broader social. economic. and environmental concerns now figure into the idea of sustainability. In the United States. barriers to greenhouse gas reduction and planning for sustainability include uncertainty about the problem and the best ways to address it. uncertainties about public support. and the lack of a clear mandate for action.

AC Transit—the principal bus operator serving the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay—began distributing free bus passes to low-income middle school and high school students in the transit service district. The program developed in response to grassroots community activism and growing political pressure to remove the burden of school transportation costs from low-income households. Advocates argued that school transportation costs were a barrier that prevented poor children from participating in after-school activities and. in severe cases. led to missed days of school.

Advocates for environmental justice – for short. EJ – have made themselves highly visible in many transportation planning and decision-making processes. in some cases seeking seats at the table and in other cases using protest. political pressure. and legal action to force change. Transportation practitioners have responded in many different ways. in some cases by forming partnerships for new programs serving low income and minority populations and in other cases resisting the perceived challenges to their expertise and authority.

Many low-income Californians do not own cars and. outside of large metropolitan areas. public transit services are often sparse or non-existent. making it difficult for jobless individuals to make the transition from welfare-to-work. The challenges are especially great for those trying to get from central-city residences to suburban jobs. so-called reverse commuters. since public transportation services have traditionally been aligned in the opposite direction. Propelling the growth in reverse commuting has been a number of powerful megatrends. Topping the list has been decentralization of employment. spawned by such factors as cheaper real estate prices on the outskirts and telecommunication advances that have allowed suburban back-offices to easily communicate with central-city core offices. Spatial mismatches have been blamed for the persistent problem of concentrated unemployment in California’s inner cities. Those with minimal education and work skills are increasingly isolated from the many entry-level and service-sector jobs in the suburbs. Many inner-city residents with suburban jobs work late-hour shifts and on weekends. periods when many buses and trains do not operate.

Bunlar homojenleşme. kutuplaşma ve hibritleşme (melezleşme) olmak üzere başlıca üç tema altında analiz edilebilir. Homojenleşme tezi. küresel kültürün Batılı ya da Amerikan kültürü etkisiyle standartlaştığını öne sürer. Bazı kanıtlar bu görüşü desteklerken. kültürel alternatiflerin varlığı ve Batılı normlara karşı oluşan dirençler küresel kültürel gelişimin kutuplaşma ile daha iyi açıklanabileceği tezinin ileri sürülmesine yol açmıştır. Küresel karşılıklı bağlılık ve bağımlılık. her zaman kültürel benzerlik ya da uyumluluk anlamına gelmez. Kültürü standartlaştırmak ekonomik organizasyonları ve teknolojiyi standartlaştırmaya göre daha zor görünmektedir. Bu yüzden kutuplaşma tezi de sınırlıdır. Hibritleşme tezi ise kültürlerin birbirleriyle kültürel alışveriş içinde olduğunu ve birbirleriyle birleştiğini böylece melez ve senkretik formlar oluşturduğunu ileri sürer. Bu görüşü destekleyen kanıtlar başlıca popüler müzik ve dini hayattan gelir.

Weber'in sosyolojisi akılcılaşma ekseninde mukayeseli uygarlıklar tarihi çalışmalarıyla modernitenin açıklanması ve tarihsel bir gelişme çizgisine yerleştirilmesi çerçevesinde oluşmuştur. Kapitalizmin oluşumu bağlamında iktisadi açıklamalar Weber'in sosyolojisinin büyük ölçüde bir iktisat sosyolojisi olarak şekillenmesine de yol açmıştır. İlk çalışmalarında daha çok tarihçi bir perspektife sahip olan Weber sonraki çalışmalarında modernitenin açıklanması için daha sosyolojik bir zemine kaymıştır. Bu bağlamda Weber'in iktisat sosyolojisi modernitenin ele alınış biçimine göre genişleyen bir ilgiye sahiptir. İlk eserlerinde modernitenin çeşitli yapılarının kökenlerinin açıklanması ile uğraşan Weber 1904 ve 1909'da yaşanan iki kırılma neticesinde gittikçe dünya tarihsel bir açıklama ve temellendirmeye ulaşmak için daha geniş çaplı çalışmalara girişmiştir. Bu tarihten sonra dünya dinlerinin iktisadi etiğine dair yazdıkları Weber'in modernitenin evrensel bir açıklaması peşinde olduğunu göstermektedir. Böylece Weber'in iktisat sosyolojisinin odağında uygarlığı anlamanın anahtarı olarak gördüğü iktisadi zihniyet çözümlemesinin bulunduğu ileri sürülebilir.,True,9r1VWzQAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC,16,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/iusoskon/issue/9549/119268,7938317223510730421,/scholar?cites=7938317223510730421,,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/101302,0,0,0

In this paper a new methodology is presented which quantifies the reserve needed on a system taking into account the uncertain nature of the wind power. Generator outage rates and load and wind power forecasts are taken into consideration when quantifying the amount of reserve needed. The reliability of the system is used as an objective measure to determine the effect of increasing wind power penetration.

Whereas increased system inertia is intrinsically linked to the addition of synchronous generation to power systems. due to differing electromechanical characteristics. this inherent link is not present in wind turbine generators. Regardless of wind turbine technology. the displacement of conventional generation with wind will result in increased rates of change of system frequency.

This would have been a considerable challenge for the old nationalised power companies; it has become an even greater challenge in today's liberalised electricity markets. Network development. voltage rise. protection. monitoring and control are connection problems common to all wind power generation. These issues are addressed through an understanding of the basic electrical engineering concepts and wind power technology. When wind power approaches 10 percent of all generation. it impinges on system operation. The underlying principles of system balancing are presented. before considering the impact of many variable generation sources whose outputs are difficult to predict. Wind power forecasting is crucial to successful wind power integration. and basic theory and current practice are considered. Storage can also help but it needs to be low cost and. ideally. based on intelligent use of existing load. Finally. electricity markets are explained and the commercial challenges facing wind power are assessed.

Although wind generation does not itself produce any harmful emissions. its effect on power system operation can actually cause an increase in the emissions of conventional plants.

Despite the fact they were not designed to operate in a flexible manner. increasing penetration of variable power sources coupled with the deregulation of the electricity sector could lead to these base-load units being shut down or operated at part-load levels more often. This cycling operation would have onerous effects on the components of these units and potentially lead to increased outages and significant costs.

This is accomplished by ensuring that adequate resources are available to respond to expected and unexpected imbalances and restoring frequency to its scheduled value in order to ensure uninterrupted electric service to customers. Electrical systems must be flexible enough to reliably operate under a variety of ""change"" scenarios. System planners and operators must understand how other parts of the system change in response to the initial change. and need tools to manage such changes to ensure reliable operation within the scheduled frequency range.

Rotor angle stability is a dynamic phenomenon generally associated with changes in active power flows that create angular separation between synchronous units in the system. With larger penetrations of wind generation being introduced into power systems. there will be large flows of active power from asynchronous generation in the system. These asynchronous active power flows can aid in maintaining the rotor angle stability of the system.

Data were collected using a four-camera video system and two forces plates incorporated within a flight of three stairs. The inverse dynamics approach was used to calculate internal moments at the knee. and these moments were normalized in magnitude (to percent body weight and leg length) and time (percent stance). The primary findings were: (1) knee joint moments were similar in shape and magnitude for the first and second steps during both stair ascent and descent; (2) the abduction knee moments. although comparable in magnitude (25–45 Nm). were statistically smaller than the extension moments (60–85 Nm) for stair ascent and descent; and (3) the moment …,True,0qItMAoAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,159,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021929095000380,15977780401296579844,/scholar?cites=15977780401296579844,,,0,0,0

Two kinds of analyses were performed: (a) a factor analysis of EMG data corresponding to 16 muscles of the lower limb and (b) a “multi-dimensional scaling” (MDS) procedure. The latter technique involved mapping the Cartesian coordinates for 16 points subject to the constraint that the distance between any two points reflected the degree of coactivity for the corresponding muscles. The results of these analyses showed that four factors could account for 91.5% of the variance in the original data set.

For them. as for all arboreal mammals. access to the abundant fruits and narrowest gaps found among the thin peripheral branches of tree crowns poses considerable safety risks and energetic demands. Most arboreal primates use flexed-limb postures to minimize problems caused by branch compliance and instability. Here. we show that Sumatran orangutans employ unique locomotor strategies to control compliance and allow access to the terminal branch niche for feeding and gap crossing. We calculated a “stiffness score.” which is a measure of the flexibility of the supports on which orangutans moved. We found that certain locomotor behaviors clearly are associated with the most compliant supports; these behaviors appear to lack regular limb sequences. which serves to avoid the risk of resonance in branch sway caused by high-frequency. patterned …,True,orPIewIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,68,https://www.pnas.org/content/106/31/12646.short,7187702685863794449,/scholar?cites=7187702685863794449,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/31/12646.full.pdf,0,0,0

Such data are therefore important in understanding the subtle relationships between morphology. function and behaviour. The triceps surae muscle group is of particular interest when studying our closest living relatives. the non‐human great apes. as they lack a significant external Achilles tendon. crucial to running locomotion in humans and other cursorial species. The aim of this study. therefore. was to determine the proportions of type I (slow) and type II (fast) fibres throughout these muscles in chimpanzees and orangutans using immunohistochemistry. The orangutan had a higher proportion of type I fibres in all muscles compared with the chimpanzees. related to their slower. more controlled movements in their arboreal habitat.

The two disorders coexist (overlap syndrome) in approximately 1% of adults but asymptomatic lower airway obstruction together with sleep-disordered breathing is more prevalent. Although obstructive sleep apnea syndrome has similar prevalence in COPD as the general population. and vice versa. factors such as body mass index and smoking influence relationships.

However. despite its accepted and wide-spread use. no detailed analysis has been presented to offer insight into the precise function of rectification. We begin this paper with arguments based on single motor unit action potential (AP) trains to demonstrate that rectification effectively enhances the firing rate information of the signal. Enhancement is achieved by shifting the peak of the AP spectrum toward the lower firing rate frequencies. whilst maintaining the firing rate spectra. A similar result is obtained using the analytic envelope of the signal extracted using the Hilbert transform. This argument is extended to simulated EMG signals generated using a published EMG model.

We have developed a novel NMI–called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR)—to improve the function of artificial arms for amputees. TMR involves transferring the residual amputated nerves to nonfunctional muscles in amputees. The reinnervated muscles act as biological amplifiers of motor commands in the amputated nerves and the surface electromyogram (EMG) can be used to enhance control of a robotic arm. Although initial clinical success with TMR has been promising. the number of degrees of freedom of the robotic arm that can be controlled has been limited by the number of reinnervated muscle sites.

1095886,Effect of extracellular potassium accumulation on muscle fiber conduction velocity: a simulation study,2009,Emma Fortune and Madeleine M Lowery,37,Annals of biomedical engineering,10,2105-2117,Springer US,A progressive reduction in muscle fiber conduction velocity is typically observed during fatiguing muscle contraction. Although the exact causes of the conduction velocity decrease have not yet been fully established. increasing evidence suggests that changes in extracellular potassium concentration may be largely responsible. In this study. a mathematical model was developed to examine the effect of extracellular potassium concentration on the muscle fiber action potential and conduction velocity. The model was used to simulate changes in extracellular potassium concentration at a range of temperatures and extracellular potassium accumulation during repetitive stimulation of the muscle fiber at 37 °C. The action potential broadened. and its amplitude and conduction velocity decreased as extracellular potassium concentration increased.

One is a frequency domain method and uses the coherence function to determine the degree of linear correlation between each frequency component of the signals. The other is a time domain method that has been developed to determine the strength of low frequency common modulations between motor unit spike trains. often referred to in the literature as 'common drive'. The relationships between these methods are systematically explored using both mathematical and experimental procedures. A mathematical derivation is presented that shows the theoretical relationship between both time and frequency domain techniques.

STN-DBS may also activate STN neurons by initiating action potential propagation in the orthodromic direction. similarly resulting in suppression of pathological oscillations in the STN. While experimental studies have provided strong evidence in support of antidromic stimulation of cortical neurons. it is difficult to separate relative contributions of antidromic and orthodromic effects of STN-DBS. The aim of this computational study was to examine the effects of antidromic and orthodromic activation on neural firing patterns and beta band (13-30 Hz) oscillations in the STN and cortex during DBS of STN afferent axons projecting from the cortex. High frequency antidromic stimulation alone effectively suppressed simulated beta activity in both the cortex and STN-globus pallidus externa (GPe) network. High frequency orthodromic stimulation. when simulated in isolation. similarly suppressed beta activity within the STN and GPe through the direct stimulation of STN neurons driven by DBS at the same frequency as the stimulus. Combined effect of antidromic and orthodromic stimulation modulated cortical activity antidromically while simultaneously orthodromically driving STN neurons. While high frequency STN-DBS reduced STN beta-band power. low frequency stimulation resulted in resonant effects. increasing beta-band activity. consistent with previous experimental observations.

Recent experimental studies suggest these assumptions may not be valid for muscle tissue. Furthermore. both muscle conductivity and permittivity are frequency-dependent (dispersive). In this paper. frequency-domain and time-domain finite-element models are used to examine the impact of capacitive effects and dispersion on the surface potential of a volume conductor. The results indicate that the effect of muscle capacitance and dispersion varies dramatically.

Globally it has been estimated that 1 in 5 adults suffer from pain and that another 1 in 10 adults are diagnosed with chronic pain each year. Pain can be acute. chronic or intermittent. or a combination of all three (1). Chronic pain. defined as pain lasting longer than three months. commonly affects the back and neck (2). Prevalence data on pain varies considerably across different studies. The prevalence of current pain at specific body sites ranges from 20-46% in studies of community-dwelling older adults (3).The literature suggests that pain increases with age. however this increase in pain plateaus in the seventh decade with the exception of pain secondary to degenerative joint disease (4).

We suggest that the sensation of fatigue is the conscious awareness of changes in subconscious homeostatic control systems. and is derived from a temporal difference between subconscious representations of these homeostatic control systems in neural networks that are induced by changes in the level of activity. These mismatches are perceived by consciousness-producing structures in the brain as the sensation of fatigue. In this model. fatigue is a complex emotion affected by factors such as motivation and drive. other emotions such as anger and fear. and memory of prior activity.

Although several scales have been developed to quantify exertion Borg’s 15-point ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) scale has been adopted as a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating whole body exertion during exercise. However. Borg’s category-ratio scale is useful in quantifying sensations of exertion related to those variables that rise exponentially with increases in exercise intensity. Previous research has examined the extent to which afferent feedback arising from cardiopulmonary and peripheral variables mediates the perception of exertionHowever. the literature has not identified a single variable that consistently explains exertion ratings. It is concluded that effort perception involves the integration of multiple afferent signals from a variety of perceptual cues.

1095927,Metabolic consequences of exercise-induced muscle damage,2007,Jason C Tee and Andrew N Bosch and Mike I Lambert,37,,10,827-836,Springer International Publishing,Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) is commonly experienced following either a bout of unaccustomed physical activity or following physical activity of greater than normal duration or intensity. The mechanistic factor responsible for the initiation of EIMD is not known; however. it is hypothesised to be either mechanical or metabolic in nature. The mechanical stress hypothesis states that EIMD is the result of physical stress upon the muscle fibre. In contrast. the metabolic stress model predicts that EIMD is the result of metabolic deficiencies. possibly through the decreased action of Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase. Irrespective of the cause of the damage. EIMD has a number of profound metabolic effects. The most notable metabolic effects of EIMD are decreased insulin sensitivity. prolonged glycogen depletion and an increase in metabolic rate both at rest and during exercise.

Post-race rectal temperatures of 30 recreational runners (maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max)= 58.3+/-5.9 ml O2. kg-1. min-1; mean+/-SD) who completed a 42.2 km marathon at 75.8%(+/-9.3%) VO2max were measured and related to their levels of dehydration (percent mass loss). their running velocities (km. h-1). and their estimated absolute metabolic rates (1 O2. min-1) for different segments of the 42.2 km race. The influence of certain anthropometric variables was also determined. Percent mass loss during the race (2.5+/-1.4%). post-race rectal temperatures (38.9+/-0.6 degrees C). and rates of sweat loss (1.0+/-0.3 1. h-1) were low. There was no statistical relationship between percent mass loss and post-race rectal temperature. Post-race rectal temperatures were significantly related to the metabolic rates for the full 42.2 km and for the last 21.1 and 6 km of the race. and to the average running velocity for the last 6 km (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01). Average sweat rates were related to metabolic rates for 42.2 km and for the last 6 km of the race (P less than 0.05) but were unrelated to running velocity.

While a degree of fatigue may be normal for any athlete during periods of high-volume training. the clinician must be able to differentiate between this physiological fatigue and more prolonged. severe fatigue which may be due to a pathological condition. As chronic fatigue can be the presenting symptom of many curable and harmful diseases. medical conditions which cause chronic fatigue have to be excluded. The clinician must then be able to differentiate between chronic fatigue associated with training or chronic fatigue from other medical causes. and also between the chronic fatigue syndrome and the overtraining syndrome.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the biomechanical changes during natural heel-toe running with learned midfoot and Pose running. Methods: Twenty heel-toe runners were instructed in midfoot running and a novel running style in which the acromium. greater trochanter. and lateral malleolus are aligned in stance (Pose running). Clinical gait analysis was performed for each running style and the biomechanical variables compared. Results: In comparison with midfoot and heel-toe running Pose running was characterized by shorter stride lengths and smaller vertical oscillations of the sacrum and left heel marker. Compared with midfoot and Pose running heel-toe running was characterized by greater magnitudes and loading rates of the vertical impact force. In preparation for initial contact. the knee flexed more in Pose than in heel-toe and midfoot running.

We examined the effect of a school-based multi-activity low-volume high-intensity interval training intervention on adolescents’ cardiometabolic health.   Methods In an exploratory controlled before-and-after design. 101 adolescents (mean age ± standard deviation [SD] 14.0 ± 0.3 years) were recruited from four schools; two were designated as intervention sites (n = 41). and two as control (n = 60). The intervention comprised 4 to 7 repetitions of 45 s maximal effort exercise (basketball. boxing. dance and soccer drills) interspersed with 90-s rest. thrice weekly for 10 weeks. Outcomes were non-fasting blood lipids and glucose. waist circumference. high sensitivity C-reactive protein. resting blood pressure. physical activity. twenty-metre shuttle-run test performance and carotid artery intima-media thickness. The difference in the change from baseline (intervention minus control) was estimated for each outcome. Using magnitude-based inferences. we calculated the probability that the true population effect was beneficial. trivial. and harmful against a threshold for the minimum clinically important difference of 0.2 between-subject SDs.   Results and Discussion Mean (± SD) attendance for the intervention (expressed as percentage of available intervention sessions [n = 30]) was 77 ± 13%.

We aimed to quantify associations between the substitution of 10 minutes of sedentary behavior with 10 minutes of light physical activity (LPA) or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Age was also explored as a potential effect modifier. Methods: We completed a secondary analysis of data from 1477 adults from the Health Survey for England (2008). Sedentary time. LPA and MVPA were measured using accelerometry. We applied isotemporal models to quantify the relationship with CVD prevalence of replacing 10 minutes of sedentary time with equivalent amounts of LPA or MVPA. Prevalence risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented. adjusted for covariates. The role of age as an effect modifier was explored via age× MVPA and age× LPA interactions. CVD was defined as per the International Classification of Diseases. Results: The prevalence of CVD was 24%. The RR was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96 to 0.99) for LPA and 0.88 (0.81 to 0.96) for MVPA. Substitution of approximately 50 minutes of LPA would be required for an association equivalent to 10 minutes of MVPA. The beneficial association of MVPA was attenuated with age. with a decrease in the relative risk reduction of~ 7% per decade. Conclusions: Isotemporal substitution of sedentary time with LPA was associated with a trivial relative risk reduction for CVD. whereas the equivalent replacement with MVPA had a small beneficial relationship.

Quantitative studies have found a decline in activity in the transition from primary to secondary education. Exergames (active video games) might increase physical activity in adolescents. In January 2011 exergame dance mat systems were introduced in to all secondary schools across two local authority districts in the UK. We performed a quasi-experimental evaluation of a natural experiment using a mixed methods design. The quantitative findings from this work have been previously published. The aim of this linked qualitative study was to explore the implementation of the dance mat scheme and offer insights into its uptake as a physical activity intervention. Embedded qualitative interviews at baseline and 12 month follow-up with purposively selected physical education teachers (n = 20) and 25 focus groups with a convenience sample of pupils (n = 120) from five intervention schools were conducted. Analysis was informed by sociology of translation approach. At baseline. participants (both teachers and pupils) reported different expectations about the dance mats and how they could be employed. Variation in use was seen at follow-up. In some settings they were frequently used to engage hard to reach groups of pupils. Overall. the dance mats were not used routinely to increase physical activity. However there were other unanticipated benefits to pupils such as improved reaction time. co-ordination and mathematic skills.

Participants were 18 male and female students. A multielement research design was used to examine the intervention effects. The intervention consisted of: (a) teacher explanation about effort; (b) students’ suggestions to increase effort; (c) a chart posting the target heart rate zones goals; and (d) teacher prompts to remind students about their effort. Participants’ heart rates were monitored during physical education lessons. The target rate was set between 70 and 85% of the participant’s estimated maximum heart rate. The results show that participants increased their time in and above target heart rate zone from 42.1% in baseline to 62.9% during intervention.

Considering the narrow ‘dose-gap’ between the benefit of caries reduction and the risk of dental fluorosis. it is recommended that fluoride intake is monitored by measuring urinary fluoride excretion. The aim of this scoping review is to map the current literature/evidence on fluoride intake and excretion studies in relation to the study population. settings. type of study design. methodology. and analytical approach.   Methods Embase/Ovid. MEDLINE/Ovid. CINAHL/EBSCO. Scopus/Elsevier were searched for relevant articles until April 2018. Studies were included if they reported intake and excretion of fluoride in healthy humans of all age groups. Findings were explored using a narrative synthesis to summarise studies characteristics and outcome measures.   Results Removal of duplicates from the originally 2295 identified records yielded 1093 studies of which 206 articles were included. Only 21.6% of the studies were conducted in children (<8-year-olds). Most studies (38.8%) used drinking water concentration as a proxy for fluoride intake. whereas only 11.7% measured fluoride intake from all sources.

Ltd,BackgroundAntiretroviral drugs reduce viral replication and can reduce mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV either by lowering plasma viral load in pregnant women or through post‐exposure prophylaxis in their newborns. In rich countries. highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) which usually comprises three drugs. has reduced the mother‐to‐child transmission rates to around 1‐2%. but HAART is not always available in low‐and middle‐income countries. In these countries. various simpler and less costly antiretroviral regimens have been offered to pregnant women or to their newborn babies. or to both.ObjectivesTo determine whether. and to what extent. antiretroviral regimens aimed at decreasing the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection achieve a clinically useful decrease in transmission risk. and what effect these interventions have on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity.,True,3Z_dgpwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,753,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003510.pub3/abstract,16925210210716661083,/scholar?cites=16925210210716661083,,https://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/NewIncentives/Siegfried%20et%20al.%202011.pdf,0,0,0

Validated questionnaires were completed to assess physical activity (Baecke questionnaire). psychological health (General Health questionnaire.

The risk alleles of the FTO polymorphisms were associated with poorer eating behaviors (higher hunger. internal locus for hunger. and emotional disinhibition scores). a higher intake of high fat foods and refined starches and more depressive symptoms. The modeled results indicate that interactions between the FTO polymorphisms or haplotypes and eating behavior. psychological health. and physical activity levels may be associated with BMI.

Subsets of different sizes were evaluated by measuring the correlation between ancestry proportions estimated by each AIM subset with ancestry proportions estimated using genome-wide data.

Increasing shares of electric vehicles (EVs) are assumed; comprising 2.5%. 15%. 34%. and 53% of the private passenger vehicle fleet in 2015. 2020. 2025. and 2030. respectively. Results show that when charged/discharged intelligently. EVs can facilitate significantly increased wind power investments already at low vehicle fleet shares. Moreover. due to vehicle-to-grid capability. EVs can reduce the need for new coal/natural gas power capacities. Wind power can be expected to provide a large share of the electricity for EVs in several of the countries.

For large amounts of wind power production. the expectation is that the specific operational costs (fuel costs. start-up costs. variable operation and maintenance costs. costs of consuming CO2 emission permits) of the other power plants will increase due to more operation time in part-load and more start-ups. The change in operational costs induced by the wind power production can only be calculated by comparing the operational costs in two power system configurations: with wind power production and with alternative wind production having properties such as conventional production. that is. being predictable and less variable.

Phase one 2006-2008,2009,Hannele Holttinen and Lennart Söder and Erik Ela,,,,,VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland,There are already several power systems coping with large amounts of wind power. High penetration of wind power has impacts that have to be managed through proper plant interconnection. integration. transmission planning. and system and market operations. This report is a summary of case studies addressing concerns about the impact of wind power‘s variability and uncertainty on power system reliability and costs. The case studies summarized in this report are not easy to compare due to different methodology and data used. as well as different assumptions on the interconnection capacity available. Integration costs of wind power need to be compared to something. like the production costs or market value of wind power. or integration cost of other production forms. There is also benefit when adding wind power to power systems: it reduces the total operating costs and emissions as wind replaces fossil fuels.Several issues that impact on the amount of wind power that can be integrated have been identified. Large balancing areas and aggregation benefits of large areas help in reducing the variability and forecast errors of wind power as well as help in pooling more cost effective balancing resources. System operation and working electricity markets at less than day-ahead time scales help reduce forecast errors of wind power. Transmission is the key to aggregation benefits. electricity markets and larger balancing areas. From the investigated studies it follows that at wind penetrations of up to 20% of gross demand (energy). system operating cost increases arising from wind variability and uncertainty amounted to about 1œ4⁄/MWh.

The cross sections below the barrier are reproduced by coupled channel calculations which include only one break-up channel with a moderate strength and a phenomenological renormalization of the potential depth.

Strange and multistrange antibaryons are considered a more important observable [5] as they are more difficult to produce in hadronic interactions and. therefore. their production rates are unlikely to reach equilibrium in the short lifetime of the fireball unless there is QGP formation.,True,GLsXju8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,92,https://www.academia.edu/download/54655721/0375-9474_2894_2990628-920171008-27613-1d0hdsu.pdf,4315706647803472097,/scholar?cites=4315706647803472097,,https://www.academia.edu/download/54655721/0375-9474_2894_2990628-920171008-27613-1d0hdsu.pdf,0,0,0

This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that two distinct droplet generation mechanisms are present (fragmentation of bubble film and hydrodynamic) leading to a bi-spectral droplet population. A model is proposed to describe the bi-spectral droplet generation mechanism. The evaporation rate of these droplet populations is analyzed by taking into account the relevant convective and radiative heat transfer mechanisms. The rapid evaporation and diminution of the small droplet spectrum can explain the exponential rate of energy transfer from the cladding surface in the vicinity above the quench front. and by analogy the enhanced heat transfer rate downstream of flow restrictions.,True,KyYbwvAAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,34,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0017931084900309,9400214093284052774,/scholar?cites=9400214093284052774,,,0,0,0

This served as the main instrument of data collection in estimating the level of awareness and utilization of biogas technology in South-Eastern Zone of Nigeria. On the whole. 549 questionnaires were used for the study. 353 were distributed to the urban population and 196 were distributed to the rural population. Despite the fact that Nigeria has abundant renewable energy resources such as biomass. solar. wind and small hydropower potentials. the rate of penetration of these energy sources into the country’s energy mix has been very slow. Biomass resources available in the South-East include: forest residue with the abundance of rain forests. farm wastes and crop residue. animal dung/poultry droppings. industrial effluents (from the industrial cities of Onitsha.

They are theoretically given comparative study for a three tooth end miller operating at 0.5. 0.75 and 0.8 radial immersions. 0.5 and 0.8 radial immersion conditions are chosen so that analysis covers situations in which repeat and continuous tool engagements occur while 0.75 radial immersion just precludes tool free flight. It results from analysis that the down end-milling mode is better favoured for workshop application than the up end-milling mode from both standpoints of cutting force and chatter stability. This superiority in chatter stability is quantified by making use of the Simpson’s rule to establish that switching from up end-milling mode to down end-milling mode at 0.5 radial immersion almost doubles the possibility of chatter free milling while at 0.75 and 0.8 radial immersions this possibility almost triples. This result conforms to the age long recognition from workshop practices that climb milling operations are much more stable than conventional milling operations.

Due to unresolved difficulties in achieving detailed results through the existing methods researchers seek for more alternative computation methods. Although previous efforts in this regard are quite significant. yet some concerns still exist on accuracy or computational efficiency achievable through the conventional methods. The lumped mass spring (LMS) method is applied in the present study. Some new steps were introduced in the basic procedure to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of the method. A new dynamic stiffness formula is written in terms of the specific energy absorption indices of the structural components. The new procedure allowed for standard state-space formulation of the crash problem. The performance of the new simulation approach is tested for a typical vehicle structure in two possible orientations called normal mode and reversed mode. The results obtained for the impact problem in normal structural mode show that a desirable energy absorption pattern of 45%. 25% and 20% of the total impact energy could be achieved through plastic deformation of the front frame. sheet metal and torque box respectively.

Firstly. waste generation in a previously not-studied location—Awka municipality—was sampled and characterized. Secondly. the characterization was done with improved accuracy using a new method called zero-intercept first-order polynomial regression. The proposed method arrives at composition values and per capita values through polynomial regression that considers sampled waste generation data and household size as regressors. respectively. There are no constituents when no waste is generated and there is no per capita waste when household size is zero. therefore. zero-intercept was imposed on the proposed linear regression approach.

Modified full-discretization map is generated for the resulting coupled delay differential equation. The generated map is validated using simulation results of MATLAB dde23. A new theory called “Theory of wave attenuation” is presented. The theory says that the curved surface behind a cutting edge has a flattening effect on some waves generated by the cutting edge.

Some of them have tried to unravel these magic spindle speeds experimentally. This is a very time consuming. costly and inaccurate optimization procedure thus the purpose of this work is to outline an analytical solution to not only the problem of finding the magic spindle speeds but also problem of separating the whole of stable operations from the unstable ones. Slotting three tooth end miller was studied using the method of time fin ite element analysis (TFEA) and validated using the result of time do main stability analysis stemming fro m MATLAB dde23 solution of the milling equation. It is seen for the studied system that though accuracy improves with increase in number of time elements used. only marginal gain in accuracy could be achieved by increase in number of elements above ten finite time elements. In other words close agreement exists between the two approaches (TFEA and MATLAB dde23) when the number of time elements is high enough. Fourteen time elements were used to generate a working chart for the studied system. The stability chart is seen to exhibit milling stability characteristics of magic spindle speeds already known by workshop practitioners. The major implication of this study becomes that time loss that is occasioned by experimental trial and error method of determining the productive spindle speeds is avoided.,True,BWekOu4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,8,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1056.5427&rep=rep1&type=pdf,13020956704915107195,/scholar?cites=13020956704915107195,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1056.5427&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1096149,New temperature-based models for reliable prediction of monthly mean daily global solar radiation,2018,Chigbogu Godwin Ozoegwu,10,Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy,2,023706,AIP Publishing LLC,Most third-world locations have a record of very limited types of measured meteorological parameters. In such locations. reliable single-parameter models are disposed to have more applications than the multi-parameter models when solar energy is needed as an explicit function. This fact motivated the effort in this work to improve empirical modeling of solar energy in terms of temperature as the sole predictor.

Both up-milling and down-milling along one-way tool path routine are considered. Analysis of production of pocket of arbitrary size allowed identification of two alternative routines of pocketing passes. namely. horizontal chronology (HC) of passes and vertical chronology (VC) of passes which are studied and compared in terms of machining time. The VC is seen to be more time saving than HC because it allows bivariate optimization while HC allows only univariate optimization.

Theory of stabilizing wave attenuation effects in machining process presented in another work is expanded in this work to postulate the behaviour of turning stability lobes to changes in material. process and structural parameters. The wave attenuation theory simply stated that rise in attenuating forces suppresses chatter instability. Analysis in this work showed that rise in tool natural frequency . damping ratio  or feed speed  causes a rise in attenuating forces thus suppressing chatter. As expected from the wave attenuation theory harder workpiece materials with higher cutting coefficients  will better resist wave attenuation. and thus exhibit more chatter instability.

Sci,1,68-75,,It will always be the desire of the machinist to simultaneously meet the two opposed demands: achieving high productivity and high surface quality. It is seen from this work that the extent to which these two demands are considered opposed depends on the machines stability information at the disposal of the machinist. The parameters adopted for the turning process considered are as follows; mass. m= 0.0431 kg; Natural frequency. ω= 5700 rad sec; damping factor. ξ= 0.02; feed speed. v= 0.0025 m/sec and material cutting coefficient. C= 3.5× 10 Nm%!. Stability chart was constructed from which a number of comments and recommendations were made. It was seen from the stability chart that the machine would have very low productivity at low spindle speed requiring very small dept of cut for stable operation. For example at a spindle speed of 2000rpm the maximum depth of cut for stable operation would be about 0.25 mm.

They are theoretically given comparative study for a three tooth end miller operating at 0.5. 0.75 and 0.8 radial immersions. 0.5 and 0.8 radial immersion conditions are chosen so that analysis covers situations in which repeat and continuous tool engagements occur while 0.75 radial immersion just precludes tool free flight. It results from analysis that the down end-milling mode is better favoured for workshop application than the up end-milling mode from both standpoints of cutting force and chatter stability. This superiority in chatter stability is quantified by making use of the Simpson’s rule to establish that switching from up end-milling mode to down end-milling mode at 0.5 radial immersion almost doubles the possibility of chatter free milling while at 0.75 and 0.8 radial immersions this possibility almost triples.

Due to unresolved difficulties in achieving detailed results through the existing methods researchers seek for more alternative computation methods. Although previous efforts in this regard are quite significant. yet some concerns still exist on accuracy or computational efficiency achievable through the conventional methods. The lumped mass spring (LMS) method is applied in the present study. Some new steps were introduced in the basic procedure to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of the method. A new dynamic stiffness formula is written in terms of the specific energy absorption indices of the structural components. The new procedure allowed for standard state-space formulation of the crash problem. The performance of the new simulation approach is tested for a typical vehicle structure in two possible orientations called normal mode and reversed mode. The results obtained for the impact problem in normal structural mode show that a desirable energy absorption pattern of 45%. 25% and 20% of the total impact energy could be achieved through plastic deformation of the front frame. sheet metal and torque box respectively.

Physically the combined mode occurs when a pre-existing slot exists in what could have been a full-immersion process. A novel geometric consideration is presented for complete definition of size and location of the pre-existing slot in terms of the component radial immersions of the combined mode.

Some of them have tried to unravel these magic spindle speeds experimentally. This is a very time consuming. costly and inaccurate optimization procedure thus the purpose of this work is to outline an analytical solution to not only the problem of finding the magic spindle speeds but also problem of separating the whole of stable operations from the unstable ones. Slotting three tooth end miller was studied using the method of time fin ite element analysis (TFEA) and validated using the result of time do main stability analysis stemming fro m MATLAB dde23 solution of the milling equation. It is seen for the studied system that though accuracy improves with increase in number of time elements used. only marginal gain in accuracy could be achieved by increase in number of elements above ten finite time elements. In other words close agreement exists between the two approaches (TFEA and MATLAB dde23) when the number of time elements is high enough. Fourteen time elements were used to generate a working chart for the studied system.

Considering the high fiscal cost of obtaining the real crash test data. and extreme computational difficulty associated with relying on high-order numerical models. this work explores the adequacy of a generic two-degree-of-freedom lumped mass–spring model in handling this research problem. The generic model was first validated using appropriate experimental data and further utilized in evaluating crashworthiness performance under various design conditions. Statistical analysis of the system response reveals the necessary design considerations required to achieve improved crashworthiness. A multi-criteria optimization study was conducted using the resulting statistical models and suitable optimization algorithms.

The disc brake friction lining with geometrical specification of Mitshibushi L-300 was produced using palm kernel shell and coconut shell powder as base material. polyester resin as binder material. graphite as lubricant. metal chips and carbides as the abrasives. A commercially bought brake pad served as control. Three different samples were produced by varying mass compositions of palm kernel shell and coconut shell. Sample A has equal mass of palm kernel shell (PKS) and coconut shell (CNS). Sample B has higher mass of PKS (83.03%) and lower mass of CNS (12.68%) while Sample C has lower mass of PKS (14.79%) and higher mass of CNS (35.92%). A constant pressure of 16.75 kN/m2 and particle size of 0.63 um were used for all samples. The binder. lubricant and abrasive composition were kept constant. The test result showed that the coefficient of friction (static and dynamic) for samples A. B and C were (0.374. 0351).(0.383. 0354) and (0.362. 0.349) while the commercial pad was (0.388. 0.359).

J,,53-73,,In this paper. genetic algorithm implemented in Matlab is used for the optimization of the boiler unit at Egbin power plant. Based on thermodynamic consideration of a boiler. the thermal efficiency of the boiler for 2008 and 2009 is computed. The thermal efficiency is defined as the objective function and is maximized using genetic algorithms subject to a list of constraints for obtaining the numerical values of the optimum operating parameters. These determined optimum operating parameters will serve as basis for improving the performance of the power plant and this is the significance of this study. The effects of genetic algorithm options (such as initial population. elite children. and crossover ratio) on the optimization results are also established. It is observed that applying genetic algorithm in the thermodynamic optimization of a case study (Egbin power plant) boiler. the percentage increase in the thermal efficiency is 4.76% and 3.89% in comparison with the existing values for the studied boiler at Egbin thermal power plant for 2008 and 2009 respectively.,True,-zoVSOYAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Darlington_Egeonu/publication/286927628_Thermodynamic_Optimization_of_Steam_Boiler_Parameter_Using_Genetic_Algorithm/links/56703aa008ae2b1f87acd7e4/Thermodynamic-Optimization-of-Steam-Boiler-Parameter-Using-Genetic-Algorithm.pdf,10743578778961566319,/scholar?cites=10743578778961566319,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Darlington_Egeonu/publication/286927628_Thermodynamic_Optimization_of_Steam_Boiler_Parameter_Using_Genetic_Algorithm/links/56703aa008ae2b1f87acd7e4/Thermodynamic-Optimization-of-Steam-Boiler-Parameter-Using-Genetic-Algorithm.pdf,0,0,0

The component based exergy analysis examines and compares the energetic and exergetic performances of each component by identifying the deficiencies of each component. Design and operating data were obtained from Egbin power plant in Nigeria. The result of the analysis showed that the total exergy that was destroyed in the power p lant was 400.015 MW. The major contributors to the exergy destruction in the power plant were the boiler (87%). the three turbines (a combined total of 9%) and the condenser (2%). The effect of increasing the High Pressure turbine (HPT) inlet temperature at constant boiler pressure incresses the exergy efficiency of the component as well as the second law efficiency of the power plant. thus reducing the exergy destruction of the component. At the variation of environmental or dead state temperature. ther e were no appreciable changes in the values of exergy efficiency of the boiler/steam generator.

The study analyzed the system’s components separately in order to identify the sites where the largest exergy losses occur and to quantify the amount. Results of the component efficiencies based on their thermodynamic models of energy and exergy analyses at design and operating years of the power plant revealed that the maximumexergy destruction efficiency occurred in the combustion chamber. Improvement approaches made on the performance of the combustion chamber included: 1) Increasing turbine inlet temperature at constant pressure ratio; 2) Increasing combustion chamber pressure ratio at constant turbine inlet temperature; and 3) Increasing both turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Results of improvement conditions show that the first condition produced progressive decrease in exergy efficiency for the design and operating years when temperature was increased from 1060?C - 1080?C at 11 bar pressure. Second condition resulted to increase in exergy efficiency when pressure increased from 11 bar to 15 bar. Similarly. increasing turbine inlet temperature and pressure by 20?C and 4 bar respectively increased the exergy efficiency by 0.22% on design condition.

1096205,Comparative evaluation of the performance of an improved solar-biomass hybrid dryer,2015,Edmund C Okoroigwe and Evidence C Ndu and Florence C Okoroigwe,26,Journal of Energy in Southern Africa,4,38-51,University of Cape Town,A solar biomass hybrid dryer intially designed with a front pass flat plate solar air heater and a biomass heating stove was redesigned. reconstructed in order to minimize the excessive convective heat losses and its performance re-evaluated. Due to poor design and contruction of the biomass heating and solar collector sections. the efficiency of the initial design was low. It is believed that the drying efficiency of the dryer could be enhanced if a back pass solar collector and a biomass heating stove incorporated with a gas to gas heat exchanger to ensure that the hot air reaching the samples is clean. smokeless and ash free. substitute for the original solar collector and biomass unit respectively in the improved version. The system's drying performance was tested on both no load and full capacity load under different meteorological conditions within Nsukka (Lat. 7 o N) for two weeks. The testing results showed that the incorporation of a new back pass solar collector and the heat exchanger enhanced the trays temperatures on no load test. Similarly. the efficiency of the dryer based on solar. biomass and solar-biomass heating in drying of fresh okra. fresh groundnut and fresh cassava chips increased from 5.19-16.04%. 0.23-3.34% and 1.636-8.96% respectively over the initial construction.

J. Phys. Sci,,1036-1041,,Activated carbon (AC) was produced from palm kernel shells (PKS) by acid activation method at temperature of 600 C. The effects of carbonization and acid impregnation time on the adsorption potential of the ACs on purification of contaminated rain and flowing river water bodies were examined.

The results show that the AC produced from PKS upon 2 days acid impregnation followed by 3 h carbonization periods. purified both water bodies better than the others on reduction of microbial and micro impurity contents of the water bodies. The implications of the results show that production of AC from PKS is value addition to oil palm processing. boost to the national economy and positive environmental impact to the people that produce and use PKS.

In the feature extraction step. eight time‐domain degradation features are extracted from the faulty variables. A fitness function as a weighted linear combination of the monotonicity. robustness. correlation. and trendability metrics is defined and used to evaluate the suitability of the features for RSL prediction. The selected features are merged using a canonical variate residuals‐based method. In the prognostic step. gray model is used in combination with empirical Bayesian algorithm for RSL prediction in the presence of scarce failure data. The proposed approach is validated on failure data collected from an operational industrial centrifugal pump and a compressor.,True,RI1oCZcAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,0,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qre.2756,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/qre.2756,0,0,0

The tracks were deposited using 99.6 % pure Ti6Al4V powder of particle size ranging between 150 - 200 µm on 99.6% Ti6Al4V substrate. The laser power was varied between 0.8 - 3.0 kW while the scanning speed. powder flow rate and the gas flow rate were kept at the values of 0.005 m/sec. 1.44 g/min and 4 l /min respectively.

The welds were produced using three different shoulder diameter tools. viz: 15. 18 and 25 mm by varying the rotational speed between 600 and 1200 rpm and the traverse speed between 50 and 300 mm/min in order to vary the heat input to the welds. The microstructures. the grain sizes and the microhardness of the joint interfaces were characterised. and the electrical resistivities of the joints were also measured. The resulting microstructural characterization revealed that good metallurgical bonding was achieved at the joint interfaces of the welds produced; this is evident with the presence of interlayers of aluminium and copper observed in the stir zones of the welds.

The principle of orthogonalization is employed for this particular purpose and some of its main properties are fully exploited to guarantee local asymptotical stability. Only the force observer requires the dynamic model of the robot manipulator for implementation. and the scheme is developed directly in workspace coordinates. so that no inverse kinematics is required.

The Ti6Al4V/TiC composites were deposited with a composition ratio of 50 wt.% Ti64l4V and 50 wt.% TiC. The depositions were achieved by delivering the two powders from a powder feeder consisting of two different hoppers and each hopper contains each of the powders. A total of eight experiments were performed. the scanning speed was kept constant at 0.005 m/s and the laser power varied between 0.4 and 3.2 kW. The gas flow rate and the powder flow rates were also kept at constant settings of 1.44 g/min and 1 l/min respectively for each hopper. The deposits were laterally sectioned. metallographically prepared and characterized through microstructural evaluation. microhardness and wear resistance performance. The effects of varying the laser power on the resulting properties of the composites were studied extensively. The microstructure consists of un-melted carbide (UMC) in the matrix of alpha and prior beta grain structure of Ti6Al4V. and in varying degrees in all the samples.

1096262,Availability analysis of oil production systems,2018,Paul A Ozor and Charles Mbohwa,,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Pretoria/Johannesburg, South Africa, October",,1281-1289,,System effectiveness in crude oil processing industries can be constrained by operational efficiency of the constitutive units. Thus ascertaining availability status of all system units can provide decision makers with an effective means of improving the technical performance of complex processing systems. Most of the works found in literatures focused on either models specifically for estimation of interval. instantaneous or stationary availability with specific repair distributions or models with mathematical complexities whose underlying assumptions impose ample application constraints to industries. This paper proposes a proof of concept compact generalized model for determination of availability of complex processing industries. The approach is clearly presented as an off-shoot of earlier but independent availability models (Lie et al. 1977. Ebeling. 2010). The applicability of the models has been illustrated using data obtained from a typical oil company. which will be called X-Company for the sake of confidentiality. The unit availability for the studied period as well as mean annual availability of the system can all be computed with the models. The lowest and highest availability values recorded for the units were 0.083 and 0.692 respectively. The mean system availability during the period stood at 0.451. The result shows that the proposed model is a good means of computing system availability. The results have also updated decision makers support tools for system performance improvement.,True,u6q1lwoAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,1,http://ieomsociety.org/southafrica2018/papers/421.pdf,13666543401749643066,/scholar?cites=13666543401749643066,,http://ieomsociety.org/southafrica2018/papers/421.pdf,0,0,0

TMS 30572 specie of Cassava tubers were hand peeled and cut into slabs with a rectangular mold (40 mm× 20 mm× 10 mm) designed for the purpose. The drying tests were conducted using a hot air-convective dryer that can dry samples weighing from 0 to 100g. The response of the drying curve or the drying kinetic depends on the applied drying conditions. The dryer was set at different heater temperatures of 150 C. 140 C. 130 C. 120 C and 110 C which gave corresponding hot air temperatures of 81 C. 78 C. 75 C. 70 C. and 66 C respectively. The hot air velocity was kept constant at 4m/s. The drying dynamics dictated by Fick’s second law for a 2-dimensional element as influenced by both initial condition and Neumann Boundary condition was used to define the mass transfer process. by assuming isotropic behavior of the samples. The comparison between the experimental results and the proposed analytical solutions of the equation of diffusion represented by Fick’s law. applied to 2–dimensional analysis for a finite shape. allows determination of the values of the diffusion coefficient.
