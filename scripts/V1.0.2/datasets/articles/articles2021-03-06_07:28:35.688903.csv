1115303,Forecasting urban PM10 and PM2. 5 pollution episodes in very stable nocturnal conditions and complex terrain using WRF–Chem CO tracer model,2011,Pablo E Saide and Gregory R Carmichael and Scott N Spak and Laura Gallardo and Axel E Osses and Marcelo A Mena-Carrasco and Mariusz Pagowski,45,Atmospheric Environment,16,2769-2780,Pergamon,This study presents a system to predict high pollution events that develop in connection with enhanced subsidence due to coastal lows. particularly in winter over Santiago de Chile. An accurate forecast of these episodes is of interest since the local government is entitled by law to take actions in advance to prevent public exposure to PM10 concentrations in excess of 150 μg m−3 (24 h running averages). The forecasting system is based on accurately simulating carbon monoxide (CO) as a PM10/PM2.5 surrogate. since during episodes and within the city there is a high correlation (over 0.95) among these pollutants. Thus. by accurately forecasting CO. which behaves closely to a tracer on this scale. a PM estimate can be made without involving aerosol-chemistry modeling. Nevertheless. the very stable nocturnal conditions over steep topography associated with maxima in concentrations are hard to represent in …,True,yFS538MAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,199,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231011001178,12738810220641477990,/scholar?cites=12738810220641477990,,http://www.uchile.cl/documentos/forecasting-urban-pm10-and-pm25-pollution-episodes-in-very-stable-nocturnal-conditions-and-complex-terrain-using-wrf-chem-co-tracer-model_98291_3_2034.pdf,0,0,0

However. large uncertainties remain in the impacts of biofuels on air quality and climate 1. 2. Sugar-cane ethanol is one of the most widely used biofuels. and Brazil is its largest producer 3. Here we use a life-cycle approach to produce spatially and temporally explicit estimates of air-pollutant emissions over the whole life cycle of sugar-cane ethanol in Brazil. We show that even in regions where pre-harvest field burning has been eliminated on half the croplands. regional emissions of air pollutants continue to increase owing to the expansion of sugar-cane growing areas. and burning continues to be the dominant life-cycle stage for emissions.

Measurements from the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx) and satellite retrievals (i.e.. products from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). and GOES-10) are used for this assessment. The Morrison double-moment microphysics scheme is newly coupled with interactive aerosols in the model. The 31-day (15 October–16 November 2008) WRF-Chem simulation with aerosol-cloud interactions (AERO hereafter) is also compared to a simulation (MET hereafter) with fixed cloud droplet number concentrations in the microphysics scheme and simplified cloud and aerosol treatments in the radiation scheme. The well-simulated aerosol quantities (aerosol number. mass composition and optical properties). and the inclusion of full aerosol-cloud couplings lead to significant improvements in many features of the simulated stratocumulus clouds: cloud optical properties and microphysical properties such as cloud top effective radius. cloud water path. and cloud optical thickness. In addition to accounting for the aerosol direct and semi-direct effects. these improvements feed back to the simulation of boundary-layer characteristics and energy budgets.

We employed a multiple linear regression model and the MM5 dynamical model to downscale June. July. and August monthly mean surface temperature over eastern North America under greenhouse gas‐driven climate change simulation by the NASA GISS GCM.

Evaluation of VOCALS-REx ship-based and three aircraft observations focuses on analyzing how aerosol loading affects marine boundary layer (MBL) dynamics and cloud microphysics. We compare local time series and campaign-averaged longitudinal gradients. and highlight differences in model simulations with (W) and without (NW) wet deposition processes. The higher aerosol loadings in the NW case produce considerable changes in MBL dynamics and cloud microphysics. in accordance with the established conceptual model of aerosol indirect effects. These include increase in cloud albedo. increase in MBL and cloud heights. drizzle suppression. increase in liquid water content. and increase in cloud lifetime. Moreover. better statistical representation of aerosol mass and number concentration improves model fidelity in reproducing observed spatial and temporal variability in cloud properties. including top and base height. droplet concentration. water content. rain rate. optical depth (COD) and liquid water path (LWP). Together. these help to quantify confidence in WRF-Chem's modeled aerosol-cloud interactions. especially in the activation parameterization. while identifying structural and parametric uncertainties including: irreversibility in rain wet removal; overestimation of marine DMS and sea salt emissions. and accelerated aqueous sulfate conversion.

Previous work has focused on the importance of long-range transport of O3 to North America air quality in springtime. However during this summer experiment the long-range transport of O3 is also shown to be important. Simulated and observed O3 transport patterns from the coast to inland northern California are shown to vary based on meteorological conditions and the O3 profiles over the oceans. which are strongly episodically affected by Asian inflows. Analysis of the correlations of O3 at various altitudes above the coastal site at Trinidad Head and at a downwind surface site in northern California. show that under long-range transport events. high O3 air-masses (O3>60 ppb) at altitudes between about 2 and 4 km can be transported inland and can significantly influence surface O3 20–30 h later. These results show the importance of characterizing the vertical structure of the lateral boundary conditions (LBC) needed in air quality simulations. The importance of the LBC on O3 prediction during this period is further studied through a series of sensitivity studies using different forms of LBC. It is shown that the use of the LBC downscaled from RAQMS global model that assimilated MLS and OMI data improves the model performance. We also show that the predictions can be further improved through the use of LBC based on NASA DC-8 airborne observations during the …,True,yFS538MAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,58,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/10/6947/2010/,9339871234888308296,/scholar?cites=9339871234888308296,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/10/6947/2010/acp-10-6947-2010.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd,Tornadoes in the Southeast and central US are episodically accompanied by smoke from biomass burning in central America. Analysis of the 27 April 2011 historical tornado outbreak shows that adding smoke to an environment already conducive to severe thunderstorm development can increase the likelihood of significant tornado occurrence. Numerical experiments indicate that the presence of smoke during this event leads to optical thickening of shallow clouds while soot within the smoke enhances the capping inversion through radiation absorption. The smoke effects are consistent with measurements of clouds and radiation before and during the outbreak. These effects result in lower cloud bases and stronger low‐level wind shear in the warm sector of the extratropical cyclone generating the outbreak. two indicators of higher probability of tornadogenesis and tornado intensity and longevity.

1115312,A new approach for estimation of fine particulate concentrations using satellite aerosol optical depth and binning of meteorological variables,2017,Muhammad Bilal and Janet E Nichol and Scott N Spak,17,Aerosol and Air Quality Research,2,356-367,Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research,ine particulate matter (PM2.5) has recently gained attention worldwide as being responsible for severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. but point based ground monitoring stations are inadequate for understanding the spatial distribution of PM2.5 over complex urban surfaces. In this study. a new approach is introduced for prediction of PM2.5 which uses satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) and binning of meteorological variables. AOD from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (C006) aerosol products. MOD04_3k Dark-Target (DT) at 3 km. MOD04 DT at 10 km. and MOD04 Deep-Blue (DB) at 10 km spatial resolution. and the Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) at 500 m resolution were obtained for Hong Kong and the industrialized Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. The SARA AOD at 500 m alone achieved a higher correlation (R = 0.72) with PM2.5 concentrations than the MODIS C6 DT AOD at 3 km (R = 0.60). the DT AOD at 10 km (R = 0.61). and the DB AOD at 10 km (R = 0.51). The SARA binning model ([PM2.5] = 110.5 [AOD] + 12.56) was developed using SARA AOD and binning of surface pressure (996–1010 hPa). This model exhibits good correlation. accurate slope. low intercept. low errors. and accurately represents the spatial distribution of PM2.5 at 500 m resolution over urban areas. Overall. the prediction power of the SARA binning model is much better than for previous models reported for Hong Kong and East Asia. and indicates the potential value of applying meteorologically-specific empirical models and incorporating boundary layer height in operational PM2.5 …,True,yFS538MAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC,50,https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-16-03-2015aac-0097?rCH=2,444382106692362737,/scholar?cites=444382106692362737,,https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-16-03-2015aac-0097.pdf,0,0,0

Sampling was conducted at ground level at an urban-rural pair of sites during January–March 2009 in eastern Wisconsin. toward the western edge of the US Great Lakes region. Areas surrounding these sites experience multiday episodes of wintertime PM2.5 pollution characterized by high fractions of ammonium nitrate in PM. low wind speeds. and air mass stagnation. Hourly surface monitoring of inorganic gases and aerosols supplemented long-term 24-h aerosol chemistry monitoring at these locations. The urban site (Milwaukee. WI) experienced 13 PM2.5 episodes. defined as periods where the seven-hour moving average PM2.5 concentration exceeded 27 μg m−3 for at least four consecutive hours. The rural site experienced seven episodes by the same metric. and all rural episodes coincided with urban episodes. Episodes were characterized by low pressure systems. shallow/stable boundary layer. light winds. and increased temperature and relative humidity relative to climatological mean conditions. They often occurred in the presence of regional snow cover at temperatures near freezing. when snow melt and sublimation could generate fog and strengthen the boundary layer inversion.

The effect of anthropogenic sources of aerosol particles on the stratocumulus deck was investigated during the VOCALS field experiment. Aerosol measurements below and above cloud were made with a ultra-high sensitivity aerosol spectrometer and analytical electron microscopy. In addition to more standard in-cloud measurements. droplets were collected and evaporated using a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI). and the non-volatile residual particles were analyzed. Many flights focused on the gradient in cloud properties on an EW track along 20° S from near the Chilean coast to remote areas offshore. Mean statistics. including their significance. from eight flights and many individual legs were compiled. Consistent with a continental source of cloud condensation nuclei. below-cloud accumulation-mode aerosol and droplet number concentration generally decreased from near shore to offshore. Single particle analysis was used to reveal types and sources of the enhanced particle number that influence droplet concentration. While a variety of particle types were found throughout the region. the dominant particles near shore were partially neutralized sulfates.

Max-Planck-Str. 13 Katlenburg-Lindau Germany, With the rapid development of the economy. the sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission from China since 2000 is of increasing concern. In this study. we estimate the annual SO2 emission in China after 2000 using a technology-based methodology specifically for China. From 2000 to 2006. total SO2 emission in China increased by 53%. from 21.7 Tg to 33.2 Tg. at an annual growth rate of 7.3%. Emissions from power plants are the main sources of SO2 in China and they increased from 10.6 Tg to 18.6 Tg in the same period. Geographically. emission from north China increased by 85%. whereas that from the south increased by only 28%. The emission growth rate slowed around 2005. and emissions began to decrease after 2006 mainly due to the wide application of flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) devices in power plants in response to a new policy of China's government. This paper shows that the trend of estimated SO2 emission in China is consistent with the trends of SO2 concentration and acid rain pH and frequency in China. as well as with the increasing trends of background SO2 and sulfate concentration in East Asia. A longitudinal gradient in the percentage change of urban SO2 concentration in Japan is found during 2000–2007. indicating that the decrease of urban SO2 is lower in areas close to the Asian continent. This implies that the transport of increasing SO2 from the Asian continent partially counteracts the local reduction of SO2 emission downwind.

Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma. showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion. closing ‘yield gaps’ on underperforming lands. increasing cropping efficiency. shifting diets and reducing waste. Together. these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.,True,POHYXREAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,5396,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10452,4488795846662145370,/scholar?cites=4488795846662145370,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt6xw5g085/qt6xw5g085.pdf,0,0,0

This net flux is the most uncertain term in the global carbon budget. not only because of uncertainties in rates of deforestation and forestation. but also because of uncertainties in the carbon density of the lands actually undergoing change. Furthermore. there are differences in approaches used to determine the flux that introduce variability into estimates in ways that are difficult to evaluate. and not all analyses consider the same types of management activities. Thirteen recent estimates of net carbon emissions from LULCC are summarized here. In addition to deforestation. all analyses considered changes in the area of agricultural lands (croplands and pastures). Some considered. also. forest management (wood harvest. shifting cultivation). None included emissions from the degradation of tropical peatlands. Means and standard deviations across the thirteen model estimates of annual emissions for the 1980s and 1990s. respectively. are 1.14 ± 0.23 and 1.12 ± 0.25 Pg C yr−1 (1 Pg = 1015 g carbon).

P deficits covered almost 30% of the global cropland area. There was massive variation in the magnitudes of these P imbalances across most regions. particularly Europe and South America.

A growing debate considers the extent to which deforestation is a result of the expansion of the Brazilian soy industry. Most recent analyses suggest that deforestation is driven by the expansion of cattle ranching. rather than soy. Soy seems to be replacing previously deforested land and/or land previously under pasture. In this study. we use municipality-level statistics on agricultural and deforested areas across the Legal Amazon from 2000 to 2006 to examine the spatial patterns and statistical relationships between deforestation and changes in pasture and soybean areas. Our results support previous studies that showed that deforestation is predominantly a result of pasture expansion.
