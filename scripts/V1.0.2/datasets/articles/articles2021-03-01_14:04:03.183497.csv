We provide an overview on the structure and composition of the plastid genome of land plants as well as the functions of its genes in an explicit phylogenetic and evolutionary context. We will discuss the architecture of land plant plastid chromosomes. including gene content and synteny across land plants. Moreover. we will explore the functions and roles of plastid encoded genes in metabolism and their evolutionary importance regarding gene retention and conservation. We suggest that the slow mode at which the plastome typically evolves is likely to be influenced by a combination of different molecular mechanisms. These include the organization of plastid genes in operons. the usually uniparental mode of plastid inheritance. the activity of highly effective repair …,True,QLEWO20AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,602,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252Fs11103-011-9762-4,14299145531654169188,/scholar?cites=14299145531654169188,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252Fs11103-011-9762-4,0,0,0

We report the complete plastomes of 10 photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic parasites plus their nonparasitic sister from the broomrape family (Orobanchaceae). By reconstructing the history of gene losses and genome reconfigurations. we find that the establishment of obligate parasitism triggers the relaxation of selective constraints. Partly because of independent losses of one inverted repeat region. Orobanchaceae plastomes vary 3.5-fold in size. with 45 kb in American squawroot (Conopholis americana) representing the smallest plastome reported from land plants.

Heritable epigenetic variation mediates between relatively slowly accumulating mutations in the DNA sequence and ephemeral adaptive responses to stress. thereby providing mechanisms for achieving stable. but potentially rapidly evolving phenotypic diversity as a response to environmental stimuli. This suggests that heritable epigenetic signals can play an important role in evolutionary processes. but so far this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. A promising new area of research focuses on the interaction between the different molecular levels that produce phenotypic variation in wild. closely-related taxa that lack genome-wide genetic differentiation. By pinpointing specific adaptive traits and investigating the mechanisms responsible for phenotypic differentiation. such study systems could allow profound insights into the role of epigenetics in the evolution and stabilization of phenotypic discontinuities. and could add to our understanding of adaptive strategies to diverse environmental conditions and their dynamics.,True,MvatzbYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,55,https://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/698421.pdf,352689982200569212,/scholar?cites=352689982200569212,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/698421.pdf,0,0,0

As in many other genera. formation of polyploids has significantly contributed to diversification and radiation of Knautia (Caprifoliaceae. Dipsacoideae). Comprehensive studies of fine- and broad-scale patterns of ploidy and genome size (GS) variation are. however. still limited to relatively few genera and little is known about the geographic distribution of ploidy levels within these genera. Here. we explore ploidy and GS variation in Knautia based on a near-complete taxonomic and comprehensive geographic sampling. Genome size is a reliable indicator of ploidy level in Knautia. even if monoploid genome downsizing is observed in the polyploid cytotypes. Twenty-four species studied are diploid. 16 tetraploid and two hexaploid. whereas ten species possess two. and two species possess three ploidy levels. Di- and tetraploids are distributed across most of the distribution area of Knautia. while hexaploids were sampled in the Balkan and Iberian Peninsulas and the Alps. We show that the frequency of polyploidisation is unevenly distributed in Knautia both in a geographic and phylogenetic context. Monoploid GS varies considerably among three evolutionary lineages (sections) of Knautia. but also within sections Trichera and Tricheroides. as well as within some of the species. Although the exact causes of this variation remain elusive. we demonstrate that monoploid GS increases significantly towards the limits of the genus’ distribution.,True,MvatzbYAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,27,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-015-0425-y,11562020771151702270,/scholar?cites=11562020771151702270,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-015-0425-y,0,0,0

However. it has remained speculative what role ecological factors have played in shaping spatial genetic structures within species. With an unprecedented. dense large‐scale sampling and genome‐screening. we tested how ecological factors have influenced the spatial genetic structures in Alpine plants. Here. we show that species growing on similar substrate types. largely determined by the nature of bedrock. displayed highly congruent spatial genetic structures.

We compared the abundance and distribution of mature individuals of three orchid and five bromeliad species between a relatively undisturbed and an adjacent disturbed plot in a Mexican humid montane forest. Most species were attached at lower positions on the trees in the disturbed plot. and in a few cases showed differences in preferred branch diameter or inclination. The spatial aggregation of epiphytes. assessed with the Morisita dispersion index and the Nearest Neighbor Index. did not differ between the plots. Five of the eight species were less common in the disturbed plot. including the orchid Lycaste aromatica. which was completely absent. Because three bromeliad species were substantially more common in the disturbed plot. the total density of all investigated epiphytes was almost three times higher in the disturbed plot. As these were the most abundant species of the entire epiphyte community. this translates to generally higher individual numbers and most likely also higher epiphyte biomass in the disturbed plot.

It was so far unclear whether this tendency is related to mode of reproduction itself or represents a side effect of polyploidy. Apomixis is advantageous for range expansions as no mating partners and pollinators are needed (Baker’s rule). Polyploidy is thought to infer fitness advantages and a higher vigour that would enable plants to adjust better to more extreme climatic conditions. However. little is known about actual performance of plants at higher elevations.

Here. we study Jacobaea carniolica. which comprises diploid. tetraploid. and hexaploid individuals regularly forming contact zones. Seeds obtained from in situ cross-pollinations within and among cytotypes were subjected to DNA flow cytometry and greenhouse germination experiments.

Irrespective of the direction of crosses. seed viability and seedling survival in diploid-polyploid crosses were substantially lower than in tetraploid-hexaploid crosses. In contrast. seedling growth traits indicated neither transgressive character expression nor any selection against hybrid offspring. Congruent with a model of genome dosage effects. these traits differed between reciprocal crosses. especially of diploids and tetraploids. where trait values resembled those of the maternal parent.

AFLPs. microsatellites). aiming at (1) a comparison of various genera. with a focus on the Ranunculus auricomus complex.(2) a validation of the different impacts of the main factors creating genetic variation. ie. ancestry. backcrossing to sexual relatives. residual sexuality. and mutational change. and (3) an attempt to outline evolutionary and ecological implications of genetic diversity. Levels of heterozygosity are usually higher in apomicts than in related sexual species; genotypic variation is considerably lower within apomictic populations. but infrequently reduced to uniclonality. Highly sensitive markers reveal considerable genotypic diversity among populations on large geographical scales. The ancestry of apomictic lineages determines basic levels of genetic diversity. and is expected to be higher if the apomict originated from hybridization between divergent sexual species. Backcrossing of apomicts to related sexual species has a highly quantitative impact. but is probably dependent on the degree of the often apparent differentiation via ploidy levels. distribution or ecological niches. Residual facultative sexuality within apomictic lineages may additionally lead to increased genetic diversity. but recent studies on wild populations suggest that frequencies of such sexual events seem to be different among genera. microspecies and even populations of the same microspecies.

Dactylorhiza majalis s.s.. D. traunsteineri s.l. and D. ebudensis are three allopolyploid species of a polyploid complex formed through unidirectional (and. in the first two cases. recurrent) hybridization between the widespread diploids D. fuchsii and D. incarnata. Differing considerably in geographical extent and ecological tolerance. the three allopolyploids together provide a useful system to explore genomic responses to allopolyploidization and reveal their role in adaptation to contrasting environments. Analyses of cDNA-AFLPs show a significant increase in the range of gene expression of these allopolyploid lineages. demonstrating higher potential for phenotypic plasticity than is shown by either parent. Moreover. allopolyploid individuals express significantly more gene variants (including novel alleles) than their parents. providing clear evidence of increased biological complexity following allopolyploidization. More genetic mutations seem to have accumulated in the older D. majalis compared with the younger D. traunsteineri since their respective formation. Multiple origins of the polyploids contribute to differential patterns of gene expression with a distinct geographic structure.

Heritable epigenetic variation mediates between relatively slowly accumulating mutations in the DNA sequence and ephemeral adaptive responses to stress. thereby providing mechanisms for achieving stable. but potentially rapidly evolving phenotypic diversity as a response to environmental stimuli. This suggests that heritable epigenetic signals can play an important role in evolutionary processes. but so far this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. A promising new area of research focuses on the interaction between the different molecular levels that produce phenotypic variation in wild. closely-related taxa that lack genome-wide genetic differentiation.

We quantified herbivory at the community level in five bromeliad. three orchid and five fern species of a Mexican humid montane forest. Leaf area loss was < 1.5% in bromeliads and orchids. but much higher (7-20%) in ferns. Damage was positively correlated with leaf nitrogen content but not with leaf life span. In contrast to low leaf damage. many bromeliads were infested by curculionid larvae feeding on the meristematic tissue at the ramet base. and we estimate that this accounts for 18 and 31% of ramet and shoot death of large individuals of Tillandsia punctulata and T. deppeana. respectively. Herbivory in flowers. capsules or inflorescence stalks reduced fecundity by c. 14-18% in three of the five bromeliads and by 90% in the orchid Lycaste aromatica. but had little effect on the …,True,sm2ycEYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,41,https://www.jstor.org/stable/4092060,14659378120730323983,/scholar?cites=14659378120730323983,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33873843/Winkler_Herbivory_in_epiphytes.pdf,0,0,0

This study examined the diet selection of free-ranging ungulates on high-alpine swards with special focus on their potential for endozoochoric dispersal. Grazed areas and fenced control plots were investigated by a point-framing method.Results show that the foraging behaviour of ungulates in high-alpine swards is selective. Flowers and fruits are preferred to leaves. Accordingly. an increase in long-distance dispersal events of alpine vascular plants by grazing ungulates can be predicted. Preferential feeding on the conspicuous flowers of herbs rather than on graminoid inflorescences causes a more pronounced reduction of seed numbers in herbs.

DNA barcoding was conducted using the P6-loop of the chloroplast trn L (UAA) intron. Although the identified plant taxa in the diets matched relatively well between the two methods. DNA barcoding gave by far taxonomically more detailed results. Quantitative comparison of results was difficult. mainly due to low taxonomic resolution of the microhistological method. which also in part explained discrepancies between the methods. Other discrepancies were likely due to biases mostly in the microhistological analysis. We conclude that DNA barcoding opens up for new possibilities in the study of plant-herbivore interactions. giving a detailed and relatively unbiased picture of food utilization of herbivores.,True,h6kBfy4AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,273,https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-6-16,6518756815733904441,/scholar?cites=6518756815733904441,,https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-6-16,0,0,0

Gross anatomy of the Kebara 2 hyoid differs little from that of modern humans. However. whether Homo neanderthalensis could use speech or complex language remains controversial. Similarity in overall shape does not necessarily demonstrate that the Kebara 2 hyoid was used in the same way as that of Homo sapiens. The mechanical performance of whole bones is partly controlled by internal trabecular geometries. regulated by bone-remodelling in response to the forces applied. Here we show that the Neanderthal and modern human hyoids also present very similar internal architectures and micro-biomechanical behaviours. Our study incorporates detailed analysis of histology. meticulous reconstruction of musculature. and computational biomechanical analysis with models incorporating internal micro-geometry. Because internal architecture reflects the loadings to which a bone is routinely subjected. our findings are consistent with a capacity for speech in the Neanderthals.,True,dNtxhXUAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,93,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082261,6969314440317308681,/scholar?cites=6969314440317308681,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082261,0,0,0

In this study we investigated the stability of three commonly used patterns of plate fixation. and constructed finite element models of a simulated mandibular condylar fracture. The completed models were heterogeneous in the distribution of bony material properties. contained about 1.2 million elements. and incorporated simulated jaw-adducting musculature. Models were run assuming linear elasticity and isotropic material properties for bone. This model was considerably larger and more complex than previous finite element models that have been used to analyse the biomechanical behaviour of differing plating techniques. The use of two parallel 2.0 titanium miniplates gave a more stable configuration with lower mean element stresses and displacements over the use of a single miniplate.

Among saber-toothed species. the iconic North American placental. Smilodon fatalis. and the bizarre South American sparassodont. Thylacosmilus atrox. represent extreme forms commonly forwarded as examples of convergent evolution. For S. fatalis. some consensus has been reached on the question of killing behaviour. with most researchers accepting the canine-shear bite hypothesis. wherein both head-depressing and jaw closing musculatures played a role in delivery of the fatal bite. However. whether. or to what degree. T. atrox may have applied a similar approach remains an open question. Here we apply a three-dimensional computational approach to examine convergence in mechanical performance between the two species. We find that. in many respects. the placental S. fatalis (a true felid) was more similar to the metatherian T. atrox than to a conical-toothed cat. In modeling of both saber-tooths we found that jaw-adductor-driven bite forces were low. but that simulations invoking neck musculature revealed less cranio-mandibular stress than in a conical-toothed cat. However. our study also revealed differences between the two saber-tooths likely reflected in the modus operandi of the kill. Jaw-adductor-driven bite forces were extremely weak in T. atrox. and its skull was even better-adapted to resist stress induced by head-depressors.

The anatomical changes that led to the vertebral shapes of modern turtles. however. are still poorly understood. Here we present comprehensive geometric morphometric analyses that trace turtle vertebral evolution and reconstruct disparity across phylogeny. Disparity of vertebral shape was high at the dawn of turtle evolution and decreased after the modern groups evolved. reflecting a stabilization of morphotypes that correspond to the two retraction modes. Stem turtles. which had a very simple mode of retraction. the lateral head tuck. show increasing flexibility of the neck through evolution towards a pleurodiran-like morphotype.

To address this question we have digitally reconstructed its skull and applied three-dimensional Finite Element Analysis to compare its mechanical performance with that of three extant marsupial carnivores and T. cynocephalus. Under loadings adjusted for differences in size that simulated forces generated by both jaw closing musculature and struggling prey. we found that stress distributions and magnitudes in the skull of N. dicksoni were more similar to those of the living spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) than to its recently extinct relative.

Prompted by a recent publication calling for dingoes to be considered taxonomically as domestic dogs (Jackson et al. 2017. Zootaxa 4317. 201-224). we review the issues of the taxonomy applied to canids. and summarise the main differences between dingoes and other canids. We conclude that (1) the Australian dingo is a geographically isolated (allopatric) species from all other Canis. and is genetically. phenotypically. ecologically. and behaviourally distinct; and (2) the dingo appears largely devoid of many of the signs of domestication. including surviving largely as a wild animal in Australia for millennia. The case of defining dingo taxonomy provides a quintessential example of the disagreements between species concepts (eg. biological. phylogenetic. ecological. morphological). Applying the biological species concept sensu stricto to the dingo as suggested by Jackson et al.(2017) and consistently across the Canidae would lead to an aggregation of all Canis populations. implying for example that dogs and wolves are the same species. Such an aggregation would have substantial implications for taxonomic clarity. biological research. and wildlife conservation. Any changes to the current nomen of the dingo (currently Canis dingo Meyer. 1793). must therefore offer a strong. evidence-based argument in favour of it being recognised as a subspecies of Canis lupus Linnaeus. 1758. or as Canis familiaris Linnaeus. 1758. and a successful application to the …,True,dNtxhXUAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,17,https://research.usc.edu.au/discovery/fulldisplay/alma99451325702621/61USC_INST:ResearchRepository?tags=scholar,5668913248213686829,/scholar?cites=5668913248213686829,,https://research.usc.edu.au/view/delivery/61USC_INST/12126827200002621/13130039160002621,0,0,0

Among saber-toothed species. the iconic North American placental. Smilodon fatalis. and the bizarre South American sparassodont. Thylacosmilus atrox. represent extreme forms commonly forwarded as examples of convergent evolution. For S. fatalis. some consensus has been reached on the question of killing behaviour. with most researchers accepting the canine-shear bite hypothesis. wherein both head-depressing and jaw closing musculatures played a role in delivery of the fatal bite. However. whether. or to what degree. T. atrox may have applied a similar approach remains an open question. Here we apply a three-dimensional computational approach to examine convergence in mechanical performance between the two species. We find that. in many respects. the placental S. fatalis (a true felid) was more similar to the metatherian T. atrox than to a conical-toothed cat. In modeling of both saber-tooths we found that jaw-adductor-driven bite forces were low. but that simulations invoking neck musculature revealed less cranio-mandibular stress than in a conical-toothed cat. However. our study also revealed differences between the two saber-tooths likely reflected in the modus operandi of the kill. Jaw-adductor-driven bite forces were extremely weak in T. atrox. and its skull was even better-adapted to resist stress induced by head-depressors.

Degenerative changes and/or repetitive abnormal loading in the lumbar spine could lead to structural failures of the intervertebral disc and herniation of the nucleus pulposus. all of which may manifest as chronic back and/or leg pain. Although lumbar discectomy is a clinically beneficial procedure for appropriately selected disc herniation patients. revision discectomy rates range from 2% to 18% within the first decade of the primary discectomy. especially in patients younger than 65 years. Discectomy being a tissue discarding procedure may compromise the biomechanical integrity of the disc and accelerate its degeneration. Nucleus replacement (NR) implants present a promising option to address some of the challenges surrounding lumbar discectomy. An NR implant may be used as an adjunct to discectomy to preserve the biomechanical integrity of the disc and minimize recurrent herniation of the nuclear tissue. Nonetheless. a systematic review of the literature on clinical outcomes for NR implants revealed high rates for endplate remodeling and implant subsidence. A detailed multiscale understanding of the mechanisms of disc herniation and reherniation. closure of the annular defect. and the ability to tailor geometry and material properties for individual patients are needed to develop the next generation of NR implants.,True,Qo0dbrIAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Uphar_Chamoli2/publication/335881387_Replacing_the_Nucleus_Pulposus_for_Degenerative_Disc_Disease_and_Disc_Herniation_Disc_Preservation_Following_Discectomy/links/5d81c54ea6fdcc12cb98a322/Replacing-the-Nucleus-Pulposus-for-Degenerative-Disc-Disease-and-Disc-Herniation-Disc-Preservation-Following-Discectomy.pdf,2651660475727077550,/scholar?cites=2651660475727077550,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Uphar_Chamoli2/publication/335881387_Replacing_the_Nucleus_Pulposus_for_Degenerative_Disc_Disease_and_Disc_Herniation_Disc_Preservation_Following_Discectomy/links/5d81c54ea6fdcc12cb98a322/Replacing-the-Nucleus-Pulposus-for-Degenerative-Disc-Disease-and-Disc-Herniation-Disc-Preservation-Following-Discectomy.pdf,0,0,0

1096883,Biomechanics of felid skulls: A comparative study using finite element approach,2011,Uphar Chamoli,,"PhM Dissertation. University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia",,,,Shape and scale-related effects on biomechanical construct of organisms depend strongly on the properties and distribution of materials of which they are built. with an inherent requirement for avoiding failure over the entire lifetime. The cat family (Felidae) has been considered morphologically and behaviourally conservative. and hence an appropriate focus for investigations into the role of allometry. Here I apply three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA) to models representing the skulls of seven extant felid species in order to (1) more fully assess their biomechanical performance; and (2) to predict allometric trends regarding overall geometry and relative distributions of cortical and cancellous bone. Results derived from incorporating material properties distribution for cortical and cancellous bone in the finite element models (FEMs) largely support the contention that mechanical behaviour in the felid skull is conservative across species. A negative allometric trend between cortical bone volume and total skull bone volume. and positive allometry between total skull bone volume and skull surface area were also observed. Further mathematical modelling using beam mechanics suggests that these allometric trends reflect a need for larger species to respond to physical challenges associated with increased size. and. that changes in skull shape. bone composition. or a combination of both. may be required to accommodate these challenges. I conclude that as felids become larger. overall skull bone volume relative to surface area increases by adding less dense and more compliant cancellous bone.

Dasyurids are a unified group with most of the extreme specializations linked through intermediates to more generalized forms. Many genera demonstrate independent development of analogous structures or losses. Dental characters alone do not identify subfamilies.  The structurally ancestral condition is generally regarded as that of Cretaceous didelphids such as Alphadon. Modern didelphids examined show considerably less character variation than modern dasyurids.

Djarthia is therefore the oldest known crown-group marsupial anywhere in the world that is represented by dental. cranial and post-cranial remains. and the oldest known Australian marsupial by 30 million years. It is also the most plesiomorphic known australidelphian. and phylogenetic analyses place it outside all other Australian marsupials.Conclusions/SignificanceAs the most plesiomorphic and oldest unequivocal australidelphian.

Multiple geographic representatives of many of the currently recognised species in each genus provide a backdrop to questions concerning the nature of species boundaries and the geographic ranges of these species. as well as the proper application of the available names. We use phylogeographic data to understand the historical connections between the major wet forest biomes of South America. specifically connections between southern Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest of coastal Brazil. Species diversity in several genera is greater than current taxonomy would suggest. While some lineages appear relatively recent (lowland species of Didelphis). the majority of extant species are surprisingly divergent. suggesting species formation well before the Pleistocene. Thus. there appears to be little support for the putative role of Pleistocene refuges in generating species diversity in these genera.

We have digitally reconstructed the jaws of a white shark to estimate maximum bite force and examine relationships among their three‐dimensional geometry. material properties and function. We predict that bite force in large white sharks may exceed c. 1.8 tonnes. the highest known for any living species. and suggest that forces may have been an order of magnitude greater still in the gigantic fossil species Carcharodon megalodon.

We find that the lightweight skull is relatively poorly adapted to generate high bite forces but better adapted to resist high pulling loads. We reject the popular notion regarding toxic bacteria utilization. Instead. we demonstrate that the effects of deep wounds inflicted are potentiated through venom with toxic activities including anticoagulation and shock induction.

Despite widespread use. few empirical studies have provided evidence to validate these models in non-human mammals and none have considered the influence of gape angle on the distribution of stress.

Bite force data in relation to jaw gape and along the tooth row. are in broad agreement with previously reported results. However stress data showed that the skull of C. l. dingo is mechanically suited to withstand stresses at wide gapes; a result that agreed well with previously held views regarding carnivoran evolution.

Here we perform functional analyses of the skull of the medium-sized (∼40 kg) patagornithine phorusrhacid Andalgalornis steulleti (upper Miocene–lower Pliocene. Andalgalá Formation. Catamarca. Argentina) to assess its mechanical performance in a comparative context. Based on computed tomographic (CT) scanning and morphological analysis. the skull of Andalgalornis steulleti is interpreted as showing features reflecting loss of intracranial immobility. Discrete anatomical attributes permitting such cranial kinesis are widespread phorusrhacids outgroups. but this is the first clear evidence of loss of cranial kinesis in a gruiform bird and may be among the best documented cases among all birds. This apomorphic loss is interpreted as an adaptation for enhanced craniofacial rigidity. particularly with regard to sagittal loading. We apply a Finite Element approach to a three-dimensional (3D) model of the skull. Based on regression analysis we estimate the bite force of Andalgalornis at the bill tip to be 133 N. Relative to results obtained from Finite Element Analysis of one of its closest living relatives (seriema) and a large predatory bird (eagle). the phorusrhacid's skull shows relatively high stress under lateral loadings. but low stress where force is applied dorsoventrally (sagittally) and in “pullback” simulations.

We present an in vivo analysis of both bite and pulling forces in Varanus komodoensis. the Komodo dragon. to determine how they contribute to feeding behavior. Observations of cranial modeling and behavior suggest that V. komodoensis feeds using bite force supplemented by pulling in the caudal/ventrocaudal direction. We tested these observations using force gauges/transducers to measure biting and pulling forces. Maximum bite force correlates with both body mass and total body length. likely due to increased muscle mass. Individuals showed consistent behaviors when biting. including the typical medial-caudal head rotation. Pull force correlates best with total body length. longer limbs and larger postcranial motions. None of these forces correlated well with head dimensions. When pulling. V. komodoensis use neck and limb movements that are associated with increased caudal and ventral oriented force. Measured bite force in Varanus komodoensis is similar to several previous estimations based on 3D models. but is low for its body mass relative to other vertebrates. Pull force. especially in the ventrocaudal direction. would allow individuals to hunt and deflesh with high success without the need of strong jaw adductors.

Chile). The trace fossil is associated with megafauna bones. plant material and unifacial lithic tools. Here we present a detailed analysis of the Pilauco ichnite and associated sedimentary structures. as well as new radiocarbon data. The ichnological analysis confidently assigns the trace to the ichnospecies Hominipes modernus—a hominoid footprint usually related to Homo sapiens. Some particular characteristics of the Pilauco trace include an elongated distal hallux. lateral digit impressions obliterated by the collapsed sediment. and sediment lumps inside and around the trace. In order to evaluate the origin of the ichnite. trackmaking experiments are performed on re-hydrated fossil bed sediments. The results demonstrate that a human agent could easily generate a footprint morphology equivalent to the sedimentary structure when walking on a saturated substrate. Based on the evidence. we conclude that the trackmaker might well have been a bare-footed adult human.

Mammals present a wide variety of sizes and shapes. and are characterized by a high number of morphological convergences that are hypothesized to reflect similar environmental pressures. Extinct South American notoungulates evolved in isolation from northern mammalian faunas in highly disparate environments.

Thirty-eight extant australidelphian species. including 10 dasyuromorphians. 22 diprotodontians. 1 notoryctomorphian and 5 peramelemorphians. were analysed. Where sexual dimorphism was prominent. genders were evaluated separately. Twenty-nine cranio-dental variables were measured for each specimen and species averages calculated. Body masses were taken as recorded for each specimen or as published species averages. The cranio-dental measures for each morpho-species were then regressed against average body mass in four distinct data-sets:(1) the entire species sample.(2) only dasyuromorphian taxa.(3) only diprotodontians. and (4) all species excluding dasyuromorphians. Each cranio-dental variable was then ranked according to various error statistics and correlation coefficients. Results suggest that predictors of body size in eutherians (such as first lower molar area). commonly used to estimate body mass in marsupials may not be reliable or accurate indicators. Significant differences in the usefulness of predictor variables between taxonomic data-sets were also observed. Total jaw length is the most reliable predictor for diprotodontians. as well as for all species combined. whereas lower molar row length appears to be more appropriate for dasyuromorphians.

Disparity of vertebral shape was high at the dawn of turtle evolution and decreased after the modern groups evolved. reflecting a stabilization of morphotypes that correspond to the two retraction modes.

The axial skeleton of ray-finned fishes is divided into abdominal and caudal regions. considered to be evolutionary modules. In this study. we test whether the convergent evolution of the ambush predator body plan is associated with predictable. regional changes in the axial skeleton. specifically whether the abdominal region is preferentially lengthened relative to the caudal region through the addition of vertebrae. We test this hypothesis in seven clades showing convergent evolution of this body plan. examining abdominal and caudal vertebral counts in over 300 living and fossil species. In four of these clades. we also examined the relationship between the fineness ratio and vertebral regionalization using phylogenetic independent contrasts.

Sánchez-Villagra,,Biological Theory,,,Springer,The growing interest and major advances of the last decades in evolutionary developmental biology (EvoDevo) have led to the recognition of the incompleteness of the Modern Synthesis of evolutionary theory. Here we discuss how paleontology makes significant contributions to integrate evolution and development. First. extinct organisms often inform us about developmental processes by showing a combination of features unrecorded in living species. We illustrate this point using the vertebrate fossil record and studies relating bone ossification to life history traits. Second. we discuss exceptionally preserved fossils that document rare ontogenetic sequences and illustrate this case with the patterns of heterochrony observed in Cambrian crustacean larvae preserved three-dimensionally.

Except for the recently extinct thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus). most are known from fragmentary craniodental material only. limiting the scope of biomechanical and ecological studies. However. a particularly well-preserved skull of the fossil species Nimbacinus dicksoni. has been recovered from middle Miocene (∼16-11.6 Ma) deposits in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area. northwestern Queensland. Here. we ask whether N. dicksoni was more similar to its recently extinct relative or to several large living marsupials in a key aspect of feeding ecology. i.e.. was N. dicksoni a relatively small or large prey specialist. To address this question we have digitally reconstructed its skull and applied three-dimensional Finite Element Analysis to compare its mechanical performance with that of three extant marsupial carnivores and T. cynocephalus. Under loadings adjusted for differences in size that simulated forces generated by both jaw closing musculature and struggling prey. we found that stress distributions and magnitudes in the skull of N. dicksoni were more similar to those of the living spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) than to its recently extinct relative. Considering the Finite Element Analysis results and dental morphology. we predict that N. dicksoni likely occupied a broadly similar ecological niche to that of D. maculatus. and was likely capable of hunting vertebrate prey that may have exceeded its own body mass.,True,GGGKEMYAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,21,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093088,24258098216931019,/scholar?cites=24258098216931019,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093088,0,0,0

With these issues in mind. we reassessed the holotype of E. platyurus as a model for standardizing the debated cervical-dorsal transition in plesiosaurians. and during this procedure. documented a “lost” cervical centrum.

Djarthia is therefore the oldest known crown-group marsupial anywhere in the world that is represented by dental. cranial and post-cranial remains. and the oldest known Australian marsupial by 30 million years. It is also the most plesiomorphic known australidelphian. and phylogenetic analyses place it outside all other Australian marsupials.Conclusions/SignificanceAs the most plesiomorphic and oldest unequivocal australidelphian. Djarthia may approximate the ancestral morphotype of the Australian marsupial radiation and suggests that the South American microbiotheres may be the result of back-dispersal from eastern Gondwana. which is the reverse of prevailing hypotheses.,True,MkjVrLEAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,113,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001858,5000779322273672806,/scholar?cites=5000779322273672806,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001858,0,0,0

Vombatiformes) is a group of extinct large-bodied (60–2500 kg) wombat-like herbivores that were common and geographically widespread in Cenozoic fossil deposits of Australia and New Guinea. Typically they are regarded to be gregarious. terrestrial quadrupeds and have been likened in body form among placental groups to sheep. rhinoceros and hippopotami. Arguably. one of the best represented species is the zygomaturine diprotodontid Nimbadon lavarackorum which is known from exceptionally well-preserved cranial and postcranial material from the middle Miocene cave deposit AL90. in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area. northwestern Queensland. Here we describe and functionally analyse the appendicular skeleton of Nimbadon lavarackorum and reveal a far more unique lifestyle for this plesiomorphic and smallest of diprotodontids. Striking similarities are evident between the skeleton of Nimbadon and that of the extant arboreal koala Phascolarctos cinereus. including the powerfully built forelimbs. highly mobile shoulder and elbow joints. proportionately large manus and pes (both with a semi-opposable digit I) and exceedingly large. recurved and laterally compressed claws. Combined with the unique (among australidelphians) proportionately shortened hindlimbs of Nimbadon. these features suggest adept climbing ability. probable suspensory behaviour. and an arboreal lifestyle.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The contrasting evolutionary histories of marsupial and placental mammals have often been attributed to their different reproductive strategies. The speciose placentals develop mainly in utero and have radiated into diverse niches. whereas marsupials are born in a highly altricial state with immediate functional requirements and are limited in taxonomic. ecological. and morphological diversity. These differences have been tied to heterochrony. and it has been hypothesized that coordinated shifts in developmental timing occur among functionally‐ or developmentally related structures. such as forelimbs in marsupials. We use new ossification sequence data for 11 marsupial and 14 placental species to assess the integration of first ossification timing among skeletal elements.

Mystacina tuberculata is also the last surviving member of Mystacinidae. the only mammalian family endemic to New Zealand (NZ) and a member of the Gondwanan bat superfamily Noctilionoidea. The capacity for true quadrupedal terrestrial locomotion in Mystacina is a secondarily derived condition. reflected in numerous skeletal and muscular specializations absent in other extant bats. The lack of ground-based predatory native NZ mammals has been assumed to have facilitated the evolution of terrestrial locomotion and the unique burrowing behaviour of Mystacina. just as flightlessness has arisen independently many times in island birds. New postcranial remains of an early Miocene mystacinid from continental Australia. Icarops aenae. offer an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Several distinctive derived features of the distal humerus are shared by the extant Mystacina tuberculata and the early Miocene Australian mystacinid Icarops aenae. Study of the myology of M. tuberculata indicates that these features are functionally correlated with terrestrial locomotion in this bat. Their presence in I. aenae suggests that this extinct mystacinid was also adapted for terrestrial locomotion. despite the existence of numerous ground-based mammalian predators in Australia during the early Miocene.

Such coagulopathic toxins may be anticoagulants or procoagulants. Snake venoms are unique in their use of procoagulant toxins for predatory purposes. The boomslang (Dispholidus typus) and the twig snakes (Thelotornis species) are iconic African snakes belonging to the family Colubridae. Both species produce strikingly similar lethal procoagulant pathologies. Despite these similarities. antivenom is only produced for treating bites by D. typus. and the mechanisms of action of both venoms have been understudied. In this study. we investigated the venom of D. typus and T. mossambicanus utilising a range of proteomic and bioactivity approaches. including determining the procoagulant properties of both venoms in relation to the human coagulation pathways. In doing so. we developed a novel procoagulant assay. utilising a Stago STA-R Max analyser. to accurately detect real time clotting in plasma at varying concentrations of venom. This approach was used to assess the clotting capabilities of the two venoms both with and without calcium and phospholipid co-factors. We found that T. mossambicanus produced a significantly stronger coagulation response compared to D. typus.

1097088,Integration. heterochrony. and adaptation in pedal digits of syndactylous marsupials,2008,Vera Weisbecker and Maria Nilsson,8,BMC Evolutionary Biology,1,1-14,BioMed Central,"Marsupial syndactyly is a curious morphology of the foot found in all species of diprotodontian and peramelemorph marsupials. It is traditionally defined as a condition in which digits II and III of the foot are bound by skin and are reduced. Past treatments of marsupial syndactyly have not considered the implications of this unique morphology for broader issues of digit development and evolution. and the ongoing debate regarding its phylogenetic meaning lacks a broad empirical basis. This study undertakes the first interdisciplinary characterisation of syndactyly. using variance/covariance matrix comparisons of morphometric measurements. locomotor indices. ossification sequences. and re-assessment of the largely anecdotal data on the phylogenetic distribution of tarsal/metatarsal articulations and ""incipient syndactyly"". Syndactylous digits have virtually identical variance/covariance matrices and display heterochronic ossification timing with respect to digits IV/V. However. this does not impact on overall locomotor adaptation patterns in the syndactylous foot as determined by analysis of locomotor predictor ratios. Reports of incipient syndactyly in some marsupial clades could not be confirmed; contrary to previous claims. syndactyly does not appear to impact on tarsal bone arrangement. The results suggest that marsupial syndactyly originates from a constraint that is rooted in early digit ontogeny and results in evolution of the syndactylous digits as a highly integrated unit. Although convergent evolution appears likely. syndactyly in Diprotodontia and Peramelemorpha may occur through homologous developmental processes.

While some extinctions have been caused by climatic and environmental change. most have been caused by anthropogenic impacts. We propose a general model to describe patterns in these anthropogenic island extinctions. Hunting. habitat loss and the introduction of invasive predators accompanied prehistoric settlement and caused declines of endemic island species. Later settlement by European colonists brought further land development. a different suite of predators and new drivers. leading to more extinctions. Extinctions alter ecological networks. causing ripple effects for islands through the loss of ecosystem processes. functions and interactions between species.

Australia. It represents one of Australia's few but exceptionally rich Pliocene vertebrate localities. and as such is an important source of paleoecological data concerning Pliocene environmental changes and its effects on ecosystems. Prior inferences about the paleoenvironment of this locality made on the basis of qualitative observations have ranged from grassland to open woodland to wetland. Examination of the carbon and oxygen isotopes in the tooth enamel of marsupials from this site represents a quantitative method for inferring the paleoenvironments and paleoecology of the fossil fauna. Results from Chinchilla show that Protemnodon sp. indet. consumed both C3 and C4 photosynthesis plant types (mean δ13C = −14.5±2.0‰). and therefore probably occupied a mixed vegetation environment. Macropus sp. indet. from Chinchilla also consumed a mixed diet of both C3 and C4 plants. with more of a tendency for C4 plant consumption (mean δ13C = −10.3±2.3‰).

This controversy has arisen after many different kinds and revisions of investigations of molecular and morphological data. Three main hypotheses of living sister-groups of turtles have resulted from them: all reptiles. crocodiles + birds or squamates + tuatara. Although embryology has played a major role in morphological studies of vertebrate phylogeny. data on developmental timing have never been examined to explore and test the alternative phylogenetic hypotheses. We conducted a comprehensive study of published and new embryological data comprising 15 turtle and eight tetrapod species belonging to other taxa. integrating for the first time data on the side-necked turtle clade. The timing of events in organogenesis of diverse character complexes in all body regions is not uniform across amniotes and can be analysed using a parsimony-based method. Changes in the relative timing of particular events diagnose many clades of amniotes and include a phylogenetic signal. A basal position of turtles to the living saurian clades is clearly supported by timing of organogenesis data. The clear signal of a basal position of turtles provided by heterochronic data implies significant convergence in either molecular. adult morphological or developmental timing characters. as only one of the alternative solutions to the phylogenetic conundrum can be right.

We aim to examine the potential relation of changes in developmental timing (heterochrony) to the origin of limb morphological diversity in an explicit comparative and quantitative framework. In particular. we studied the relative time sequence of development of the forelimbs versus the hindlimbs in 138 embryos of 14 tetrapod species spanning a diverse taxonomic. ecomorphological and life-history breadth. Whole-mounts and histological sections were used to code the appearance of 10 developmental events comprising landmarks of development from the early bud stage to late chondrogenesis in the forelimb and the corresponding serial homologues in the hindlimb. An overall pattern of change across tetrapods can be discerned and appears to be relatively clade-specific. In the primitive condition. as seen in Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes. the forelimb/pectoral fin develops earlier than the hindlimb/pelvic fin.

Here. we provide osteogenetic data that identify developmental criteria with which to recognize cervical vs. noncervical vertebrae in mammals. Except for sloths. all mammals show the late ossification of the caudal-most centra in the neck after other centra and neural arches. In sloths with 8–10 ribless neck vertebrae. the caudal-most neck centra ossify early. matching the pattern observed in cranial thoracic vertebrae of other mammals. Accordingly. we interpret the ribless neck vertebrae of three-toed sloths caudal to V7 as thoracic based on our developmental criterion. Applied to the unusual vertebral phenotype of long-necked sloths. these data support the …,True,taTQzw0AAAAJ:TlpoogIpr_IC,99,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/44/18903.short,14038651135678903059,/scholar?cites=14038651135678903059,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/107/44/18903.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here we present the embryonic ossification sequence of 134 species. covering all major groups of mammals and their close relatives. This comprehensive data set allows reconstruction of the heterochronic and modular evolution of the skull and the condition of the last common ancestor of mammals. We show that the mode of ossification (dermal or endochondral) unites bones into integrated evolutionary modules of heterochronic changes and imposes evolutionary constraints on cranial heterochrony. However. some skull-roof bones. such as the supraoccipital. exhibit evolutionary degrees of freedom in these constraints. Ossification timing of the neurocranium was considerably accelerated during the origin of mammals.

Filling this gap is essential for a better understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among living marsupials. the biogeographic pathways that led to their current distribution as well as the successive evolutionary steps that led to their current diversity. habits and various specializations that distinguish them from placental mammals.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report the first skull of a 55 million year old peradectid marsupial from the early Eocene of North America and exceptionally preserved skeletons of an Oligocene herpetotheriid. both representing critical groups to understand early marsupial evolution. A comprehensive phylogenetic cladistic analysis of Marsupialia including the new findings and close relatives of marsupials show that peradectids are the sister group of living opossums and herpetotheriids are the sister group of all living marsupials.  Conclusions/Significance The results imply that North America played an important role in early Cenozoic marsupial evolutionary history and may have even been the center of origin of living marsupials and opossums. New data from the herpetotheriid postcranium support the view that the ancestral morphotype of Marsupialia was more terrestrial than opossums are.

The bone histology of the carapace of two adult specimens from the Urumaco Formation is described herein. one of which is the largest of this species ever found. In order to determine phylogenetic versus scaling factors influencing bone histology. S. geographicus is compared with related podocnemid Podocnemis erythrocephala. and with fossil and Recent pelomedusoides taxa Bothremys barberi. Taphrosphys sulcatus.“Foxemys cf. F. mechinorum”. and Pelomedusa subrufa. Potential scaling effects on bone histology were further investigated by comparison to the Pleistocene giant tortoise Hesperotestudo (Caudochelys) crassiscutata and the Late Cretaceous marine protostegid turtle Archelon ischyros. A diploe structure of the shell with well developed external and internal cortices framing inte− rior cancellous bone is plesiomorphic for all sampled taxa. Similarly. the occurrence of growth marks in the shell ele− ments is interpreted as plesiomorphic. with the sampled neural elements providing the most extensive record of growth marks. The assignment of S. geographicus to the Podocnemidae was neither strengthened nor refuted by the bone his− tology. A reduced thickness of the internal cortex of the shell elements constitutes a potential synapomorphy of the Bothremydidae.

The proportional length of the mandibular symphysis correlates consistently with rostral shape. forming as much as 50% of the mandible’s length in longirostrine forms. but 10% in brevirostrine crocodilians. Here we analyse the structural consequences of an elongate mandibular symphysis in relation to feeding behaviours.   Methods/Principal Findings Simple beam and high resolution Finite Element (FE) models of seven species of crocodile were analysed under loads simulating biting. shaking and twisting. Using beam theory. we statistically compared multiple hypotheses of which morphological variables should control the biomechanical response. Brevi- and mesorostrine morphologies were found to consistently outperform longirostrine types when subject to equivalent biting. shaking and twisting loads. The best predictors of performance for biting and twisting loads in FE models were overall length and symphyseal length respectively; for shaking loads symphyseal length and a multivariate measurement of shape (PC1– which is strongly but not exclusively correlated with symphyseal length) were equally good predictors. Linear measurements were better predictors than multivariate measurements of shape in biting and twisting loads. For both biting and shaking loads but not for twisting. simple beam models agree with best performance predictors in FE models.

1097144,Constructing an invasion machine: the rapid evolution of a dispersal-enhancing phenotype during the cane toad invasion of Australia,2016,CM Hudson and MR McCurry and P Lundgren and CR McHenry and R Shine,11,PloS one,9,e0156950,Public Library of Science,Biological invasions can induce rapid evolutionary change. As cane toads (Rhinella marina) have spread across tropical Australia over an 80-year period. their rate of invasion has increased from around 15 to 60 km per annum. Toads at the invasion front disperse much faster and further than conspecifics from range-core areas. and their offspring inherit that rapid dispersal rate. We investigated morphological changes that have accompanied this dramatic acceleration. by conducting three-dimensional morphometric analyses of toads from both range-core and invasion-front populations. Morphology of heads. limbs. pectoral girdles and pelvic girdles differed significantly between toads from the two areas. ranging from 0.5% to 16.5% difference in mean bone dimensions between populations. with invasion-front toads exhibiting wider forelimbs. narrower hindlimbs and more compact skulls. Those changes plausibly reflect an increased reliance on bounding (multiple short hops in quick succession) rather than separate large leaps. Within an 80-year period. invasive cane toads have converted the basic anuran body plan – which evolved for occasional large leaps to evade predators – into a morphotype better-suited to sustained long-distance travel.,True,OlrgNwUAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,33,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156950,3363839077505111663,/scholar?cites=3363839077505111663,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156950,0,0,0

We addressed this deficit through three-dimensional morphometric analysis of the full diversity of crocodilian and toothed whale (Odontoceti) skull shapes. Our focus on biomechanically important aspects of shape allowed us to overcome difficulties involved in comparing mammals and reptiles. which have fundamental differences in the number and position of skull bones. We examined whether diet. habitat and prey size correlated with skull shape using phylogenetically informed statistical procedures.

This study quantitatively assessed variation in the shape of the cranium and mandible in varanoid lizards. and its relationship to structural performance (von Mises strain) and interspecific differences in feeding ecology. Geometric morphometric and linear morphometric analyses were used to evaluate morphological differences. and finite element analysis was used to quantify variation in structural performance (strain during simulated biting. shaking and pulling). This data was then integrated with ecological classes compiled from relevant scientific literature on each species in order to establish structure-function relationships. Finite element modelling results showed that variation in cranial morphology resulted in large differences in the magnitudes and locations of strain in biting. shaking and pulling load cases. Gracile species such as Varanus salvadorii displayed high strain levels during shaking. especially in the areas between the orbits. All models exhibit less strain during pull back loading compared to shake loading. even though a larger force was applied (pull =30N. shake = 20N). Relationships were identified between the morphology. performance. and ecology. Species that did not feed on hard prey clustered in the gracile region of cranial morphospace and exhibited significantly higher levels of strain during biting (P = 0.0106).

However. its rapid evolution in recent years from a novel approach to common practice demands some scrutiny in regards to the validity of results and the appropriateness of assumptions inherent in setting up simulations. Both validation and sensitivity analyses remain unexplored in many comparative analyses. and assumptions considered to be ‘reasonable’ are often assumed to have little influence on the results and their interpretation.Here we report an extensive sensitivity analysis where high resolution finite element (FE) models of mandibles from seven species of crocodile were analysed under loads typical for comparative analysis: biting. shaking. and twisting. Simulations explored the effect on both the absolute response and the interspecies pattern of results to variations in commonly used input parameters. Our sensitivity analysis focuses on assumptions relating to the selection of material properties (heterogeneous or homogeneous). scaling (standardising volume. surface area. or length). tooth position (front. mid. or back tooth engagement). and linear load case (type of loading for each feeding type).Our findings show that in a comparative context.

In producing finite element models. surface mesh resolution is influenced by the resolution of input geometry. and influences the resolution of the ensuing solid mesh used for numerical analysis. Despite a large number of studies incorporating sensitivity studies of the effects of solid mesh resolution there has not yet been any investigation into the effect of surface mesh resolution upon results in a comparative context. Here we use a dataset of crocodile crania to examine the effects of surface resolution on FEA results in a comparative context. Seven high-resolution surface meshes were each down-sampled to varying degrees while keeping the resulting number of solid elements constant. These models were then subjected to bite and shake load cases using finite element analysis. The results show that incremental decreases in surface resolution can result in fluctuations in strain magnitudes. but that it is possible to obtain stable results using lower resolution surface in a comparative FEA study. As surface mesh resolution links input geometry with the resulting solid mesh. the implication of these results is that low resolution input geometry and solid meshes may provide valid results in a comparative context.,True,OlrgNwUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,15,https://peerj.com/articles/988/,13101275024566599313,/scholar?cites=13101275024566599313,,https://peerj.com/articles/988/,0,0,0

In Middle Pleistocene times. the banks of a small gully were repeatedly occupied by human groups leaving Acheulean and Sangoan material cultures in an interstratified pattern. Optical age determinations on aeolian intercalations within the gully sediments range between 220 and 150 ka. This sequence is truncated by Nile floodplain silts in which three occupation levels with Lupemban-related Nubian Complex assemblages (Van Peer. 1998) are stratified. The long archaeological sequence at 8-B-11 is a rare African case to document the Early toMiddle Stone Age transition by means of primary context situations in direct stratigraphic superposition (Clark. 2001; Tryon & McBrearty. 2002). In contrast to the Acheulean. the early MSA Sangoan levels show sophisticated behaviours involving considerable technological and symbolic investment. Quartzite cobbles were used in the grinding of vegetal materials. Yellow and red ochre were exploited and ground to pigments using shaped mortars and selected chert nodules. We conclude that 8-B-11 is a key site with regard to the initial emergence of modern human behaviour outside subsaharan Africa (McBrearty & Brooks. 2000).,True,thi3JycAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,233,https://www.academia.edu/download/6574629/jhe8-b-11.pdf,17789267758366280717,/scholar?cites=17789267758366280717,,https://www.academia.edu/download/6574629/jhe8-b-11.pdf,0,0,0

White 1994). Discussion of the archaeological evidence has focussed on methods of dating. in particular luminescence and radiocarbon dating. A date of about 40.000 bp is favoured by those who prefer the radiocarbon chronology. while others argue that luminescence dating of several Australian sites suggests an initial colonization between 50.000 and 60.000 years ago (Roberts et al. 1990. cf. Hiscock 1990; Bowdler 1991; Roberts et al. 1993; Roberts & Jones 1994). In addition.

A case study involving obsidian artefacts from an open site in Papua New Guinea is used to illustrate the new approach. Starch grains. a class of residue which has had little attention outside Australia. were chosen as the focus of study because of their abundance at this site.

It is characterised by appealing simplicity. Selective over hunting. facilitated by naiveté to human predation. produced rapid mass extinctions of large animals wherever subsistence societies colonised new landmasses. Taken at face value the circumstantial case for blitzkrieg is compelling and despite a paucity of direct evidence it has gained considerable support.

Amorphous silica occurs in significant amounts both in plants and in certain types of stone used to make lithic artefacts. Four stages of polish formation are derived from the glass polishing theory because they are useful for identifying mechanisms of how silica acts as a polishing agent. Amorphous silica is found to be an important polishing agent. even for wood with a very low silica content. Polishing agents may also contribute to polishes arising from stone tool contact with bone. skin. meat and shell. Implications are considered for flint. obsidian. quartz and other stone tool materials with use-polish.

The Donghulin site in Beijing was occupied at the onset of the Holocene. and excavations have revealed a rich archaeological record for investigating the changing subsistence strategies during this transitional period. A functional study of two grinding stones (a slab and a handstone) near a burial dated to 9220–8750 cal BC at Donghulin investigated the range of plants exploited during this early occupation period. Starch residues indicate that the grinding stones were used for processing plants. and confirm processing of acorns. which is consistent with the incidence of oak in the pollen record.

In this chapter. we look at microscopic observations and other techniques that archaeologists employ to determine the function of things. Our primary interest is in the context and use of tools. but this is rarely an end in itself. Tools can potentially tell us about subsistence history. plant food preparation. craft production. weaponry. and other technologies. The determination of function is a fundamental step. but context is always important. Whether or not they are actually used for cooking or storage. ceramic pots or bronze jars can have stylized forms. decoration. and a ceremonial purpose. Intention may be difficult to reconstruct. but it is also an important element of functional analysis. Not even stone tools function in a world devoid of social meaning (Edmonds 1995). but with a handle on function we can better understand other influences on artifact variability (such as personal. stylistic. and other constraints).Implements are not only identified by signs of utilization. but sometimes by observed use. ethnography. patterned production. purposeful shape. or design (see Kamminga 1985). Nor do they have to be actually made by people (as implied by the Latin root of the word “artifact”). A stick thrown at a dog is a kind of artifact. Ethnographic studies show that some manufactured tools have no purposeful or planned shape. and sustain no clear macroscopic traces of use. despite intensive work (White & Thomas 1972; Hayden 1977). The by-products of implement manufacture (stone axe production. for example) can also be used as expedient tools (Burton 1989).

Because the broad aim of functional morphological analyses of extinct organisms is to breathe life into fossils. paleontologists are challenged to reconstruct those portions of the animal not normally prese~ ed in the fossil record-in particular. soft tissues. Soft-tissue considerations are important for two major reasons:(1) Soft tissues often have korphogenetic over skeletal tissues. and (2) such considerations often lie at.. the base of numerous paleobiological inferences. Furthermore. soft-tissue analysis can provide causal hypotheses of phylogenetic character correlation. A methodology for reconstructing soft anatomy in fossils-the Extant Phylogenetic Bracket approach-is proposed here. This method makes explicit reference to at least the first two extant outgroups of the fossil taxon of interest. It is based firmly on the relation of biological homology. provides a means of rigorously establishing the limits of our inferences. and allows construction of a hierarchy of inference.

Despite the ubiquity and prominence of the antorbital cavity. its function and importance in craniofacial evolution have been problematic. Discovering the significance of the antorbital cavity is a two step process: first. establishing the function of the bony cavity (that is. its soft-tissue relations). and second. determining the biological role of the enclosed structure. The first step is the most fundamental. and hence is examined at length. Three hypotheses for the function of the antorbital cavity have been advanced. suggesting that it housed (1) a gland.

But the heart of the volume presents the anatomy. relationships. and paleobiology of the undisputed Mesozoic aviary. Some of the book's most exciting features are the new definitive descriptions and illustrations of taxa that previously have received only brief notice. such as the alvarezsaurid Shuvuuia; the enantiornithines Sinornis; Eoalulavis. Vorona. and Patagopteryx; and the hesperornithiform Enaliornis. The origin of birds and their relationship to dinosaurs continue to be hotly debated among paleontologists. ornithologists. and evolutionary biologists.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Homology of virtually all major components of facial anatomy is assessed in Archosauria in order to address the function of the antorbital cavity. an engimatic structure that is diagnostic for the group. Proposed functions center on its being a housing for a gland. a muscle. or a paranasal air sinus. Homology is approached in the context of the Extant Phylogenetic Bracket method of reconstructing unpreserved aspects of extinct organisms. Facial anatomy and its ontogeny was studied in extant archosaurs (birds and crocodilians) to determine the osteological correlates of each soft‐tissue component; resemblances between birds and crocodilians comprised the similarity test of homology. The congruence test of homology involved surveying phylogenetically relevant fossil archosaurs for these bony signatures.

Just a year be-of fore the discovery of the first Archaeopteryx specimen. Louis Agassiz invoked “the definiteness of the characters of the class of birds” in support of his anti-evolutionary views (Mayr. 1970: 302). Soon after its discov-ery in 1861. Archaeopteryx flew into the storm set off by Darwin's Origin of Species (1859). The importance of Ar-chaeopteryx in filling the gap between reptiles and birds was immediately understood by Thomas Huxley (Rud-wick. 1976) and Hugh Falconer. who wrote to Darwin in 1863:“Had the Solenhofen quarries been commissioned by august command—to turn out a strange being à la Darwin—it could not have executed the behest more handsomely—than with the Archaeopteryx”(Kritsky. 1992: 408). However. although privately delighted with the discovery. Darwin exercised remarkable restraint when commenting on it in Descent of Man (1871) and the 1872 edition of Origin of Species (Kritsky. 1992). probably because of Charles Lyell's insistence on the inherent incompleteness of the fossil record and thus its a priori minor significance as evidence of evolution (Rudwick.,True,6H1ool4AAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC,134,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2MQeh1KCp7sC&oi=fnd&pg=PA129&dq=info:3dsA9TdXEkUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Fv7h1Hc6ZT&sig=WuFc3hk3e0XN1vjwNCFMZr1FtfA,4977136436043111389,/scholar?cites=4977136436043111389,,,0,0,0

This “lost anatomy” is often underappreciated such that the ends of bones are typically considered to be the joint surfaces. potentially having a major impact on functional interpretation. Extant alligators and birds were used to establish an objective basis for inferences about cartilaginous articular structures in such extinct archosaur clades as non-avian dinosaurs. Limb elements of alligators. ostriches. and other birds were dissected. disarticulated. and defleshed. Lengths and condylar shapes of elements with intact epiphyses were measured. Limbs were subsequently completely skeletonized and the measurements repeated. Removal of cartilaginous condylar regions resulted in statistically significant changes in element length and condylar breadth. Moreover. there was marked loss of those cartilaginous structures responsible for joint architecture and congruence. Compared to alligators. birds showed less dramatic. but still significant changes. Condylar morphologies of dinosaur limb bones suggest that most non-coelurosaurian clades possessed large cartilaginous epiphyses that relied on the maintenance of vascular channels that are otherwise eliminated early in ontogeny in smaller-bodied tetrapods. A sensitivity analysis using cartilage correction factors (CCFs) obtained from extant taxa indicates that whereas the presence of cartilaginous epiphyses only moderately increases estimates of dinosaur height and speed. it has …,True,6H1ool4AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,102,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013120,1405379503094696526,/scholar?cites=1405379503094696526,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013120,0,0,0

Phenotypic integration and modularity have been hypothesized to shape morphological evolution. and we extended simulations to confirm that trait integration can influence both the trajectory and magnitude of response to selection. We further demonstrate that phenotypic integration can produce both more and less disparate organisms than would be expected under random walk models by repartitioning variance in preferred directions. This effect can also be expected to favour homoplasy and convergent evolution.

Most studies examining phenotypic trait correlations. through analysis of morphological integration. consider only few taxa. with limited ability to test hypotheses of the influence of trait integration on morphological variation and diversity. The few comparative studies in less inclusive groups have yielded varying relationships of integration to the key factors of phylogeny and diet. In this paper.

1097224,The influence of modularity on cranial morphological disparity in Carnivora and Primates (Mammalia),2010,Anjali Goswami and P David Polly,5,PLoS One,3,e9517-e9517,Public Library of Science,Background Although variation provides the raw material for natural selection and evolution. few empirical data exist about the factors controlling morphological variation. Because developmental constraints on variation are expected to act by influencing trait correlations. studies of modularity offer promising approaches that quantify and summarize patterns of trait relationships. Modules. highly-correlated and semi-autonomous sets of traits. are observed at many levels of biological organization. from genes to colonies. The evolutionary significance of modularity is considerable. with potential effects including constraining the variation of individual traits. circumventing pleiotropy and canalization. and facilitating the transformation of functional structures. Despite these important consequences. there has been little empirical study of how modularity influences morphological evolution on a macroevolutionary scale. Here. we conduct the first morphometric analysis of modularity and disparity in two clades of placental mammals. Primates and Carnivora. and test if trait integration within modules constrains or facilitates morphological evolution.  Principal Findings We used both randomization methods and direct comparisons of landmark variance to compare disparity in the six cranial modules identified in previous studies. The cranial base. a highly-integrated module. showed significantly low disparity in Primates and low landmark variance in both Primates and Carnivora. The vault. zygomatic-pterygoid and orbit modules. characterized by low trait integration. displayed significantly high disparity within Carnivora. 14 of 24 results from analyses of disparity …,True,o0BAl1QAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,160,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009517,11812790360620044571,/scholar?cites=11812790360620044571,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009517,0,0,0

1097228,Methods for studying morphological integration and modularity,2010,ANJALI GOSWAMI and P DAVID Polly,,,,213-243,,Morphological integration and modularity are closely related concepts about how different traits of an organism are correlated. Integration is the overall pattern of intercorrelation; modularity is the partitioning of integration into evolutionarily or developmentally independent blocks of traits. Modularity and integration are usually studied using quantitative phenotypic data. which can be obtained either from extant or fossil organisms. Many methods are now available to study integration and modularity. all of which involve the analysis of patterns found in trait correlation or covariance matrices. We review matrix correlation. random skewers. fluctuating asymmetry. cluster analysis. Euclidean distance matrix analysis (EDMA). graphical modelling. two-block partial least squares. RV coefficients. and theoretical matrix modelling and discuss their similarities and differences. We also review different coefficients that are used to measure correlations. We apply all the methods to cranial landmark data from and ontogenetic series of Japanese macaques. Macaca fuscata to illustrate the methods and their individual strengths and weaknesses. We conclude that the exploratory approaches (cluster analyses of various sorts) were less informative and less consistent with one another than were the results of model testing or comparative approaches. Nevertheless. we found that competing models of modularity and integration are often similar enough that they are not statistically distinguishable; we expect. therefore. that several models will often be significantly correlated with observed data.,True,o0BAl1QAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,106,"https://pollylab.indiana.edu/doc/papers/Goswami%20and%20Polly,%202010,%20Modularity%20and%20Integration%20Short%20Course.pdf",15443310831067746589,/scholar?cites=15443310831067746589,,"https://pollylab.indiana.edu/doc/papers/Goswami%20and%20Polly,%202010,%20Modularity%20and%20Integration%20Short%20Course.pdf",0,0,0

Yet. many other mammals use their forelimbs to grasp and manipulate objects.

Here. we test the arboreal origin of grasping and investigate whether an arboreal lifestyle could confer a greater grasping ability in musteloid carnivorans. Moreover. we investigate the morphological adaptations related to grasping and the differences between arboreal species with different grasping abilities.

Preventing livestock losses would help to achieve three goals common to many human societies: preserve nature. protect animal welfare. and safeguard human livelihoods. Between 2016 and 2018. four independent reviews evaluated >40 years of research on lethal and nonlethal interventions for reducing predation on livestock.

Dickman,95,Journal of Mammalogy,6,1278-1288,American Society of Mammalogists,The diets of predators and their selection of prey often shape prey community dynamics. Understanding how different predators select their prey could enable ecologists to predict their impact on specific prey populations.

Using two common species of Australian small mammals that have persisted in the presence of an alien predator. the European red fox Vulpes vulpes. for over a century. we hypothesised that populations of both would perform better where the activity of the predator was low than where it was high and that prey individuals would avoid signs of the predator’s presence. We found no difference in prey abundance in sites with high and low fox activity. but survival of one species—the bush rat Rattus fuscipes—was almost twofold higher where fox activity was low.

The timing of the annual rut within each of the ten described species varies little from year to year at any given locality. but for some species can differ by up to four months between locations. To determine the influence of photoperiod in regulating the precise interannual synchrony of mating and ovulation. we first investigated populations of each species at over 300 localities throughout their geographical ranges to identify the time of reproduction. We then compared the absolute photoperiod and the rate of change of photoperiod prevailing at the time of reproduction in all population localities.

Crowther,122,Oikos,5,761 - 769,Wiley,The exploitation ecosystems hypothesis (EEH) makes predictions about trophic interactions along gradients of primary productivity. The EEH has been shown to apply to a wide range of terrestrial environments but its applicability to arid environments has received little attention. One reason for this is that arid environments may not satisfy the assumptions of the EEH because dearth of water may limit biological activity in both temporal and spatial contexts. The EEH predicts that herbivore biomass should increase linearly with primary productivity in the absence of predators; but when predators are present herbivore biomass will remain relatively constant due to top down regulation. We tested this prediction in an arid environment using rainfall as a proxy of primary productivity and an index of the abundance of the dominant herbivores (kangaroos Macropus spp.).

1097269,Could direct killing by larger dingoes have caused the extinction of the thylacine from mainland Australia?,2012,Mike Letnic and Melanie Fillios and Mathew S Crowther,7,PloS ONE,5,e34877,,Invasive predators can impose strong selection pressure on species that evolved in their absence and drive species to extinction. Interactions between coexisting predators may be particularly strong. as larger predators frequently kill smaller predators and suppress their abundances. Until 3500 years ago the marsupial thylacine was Australia's largest predator. It became extinct from the mainland soon after the arrival of a morphologically convergent placental predator. the dingo. but persisted in the absence of dingoes on the island of Tasmania until the 20th century. As Tasmanian thylacines were larger than dingoes. it has been argued that dingoes were unlikely to have caused the extinction of mainland thylacines because larger predators are rarely killed by smaller predators. By comparing Holocene specimens from the same regions of mainland Australia. we show that dingoes were similarly sized to male thylacines but considerably larger than female thylacines. Female thylacines would have been vulnerable to killing by dingoes. Such killing could have depressed the reproductive output of thylacine populations. Our results support the hypothesis that direct killing by larger dingoes drove thylacines to extinction on mainland Australia.

We combined optically stimulated luminescence dating of sediments with U-Th and palaeomagnetic analyses of flowstones to establish that all sediments containing Homo naledi fossils can be allocated to a single stratigraphic entity (sub-unit 3b). interpreted to be deposited between 236 ka and 414 ka. This result has been confirmed independently by dating three H. naledi teeth with combined U-series and electron spin resonance (US-ESR) dating. Two dating scenarios for the fossils were tested by varying the assumed levels of 222Rn loss in the encasing sediments: a maximum age scenario provides an average age for the two least altered fossil teeth of 253 +82/–70 ka. whilst a minimum age scenario yields an average age of 200 +70/–61 ka. We consider the maximum age scenario to more closely reflect conditions in the cave. and therefore. the true age of the fossils. By combining the US-ESR maximum age estimate obtained from the teeth. with the U-Th age for the oldest flowstone overlying Homo naledi fossils. we have constrained the depositional age of Homo naledi to a period between 236 ka and 335 ka.

Southwest China has been identified from genetic research as a hotspot of human diversity. containing ancient mtDNA and Y-DNA lineages. and has yielded a number of human remains thought to derive from Pleistocene deposits. We have prepared. reconstructed. described and dated a new partial skull from a consolidated sediment block collected in 1979 from the site of Longlin Cave (Guangxi Province). We also undertook new excavations at Maludong (Yunnan Province) to clarify the stratigraphy and dating of a large sample of mostly undescribed human remains from the site.   Methodology/Principal Findings We undertook a detailed comparison of cranial. including a virtual endocast for the Maludong calotte. mandibular and dental remains from these two localities. Both samples probably derive from the same population. exhibiting an unusual mixture of modern human traits. characters probably plesiomorphic for later Homo. and some unusual features. We dated charcoal with AMS radiocarbon dating and speleothem with the Uranium-series technique and the results show both samples to be from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition: ∼14.3-11.5 ka.   Conclusions/Significance Our analysis suggests two plausible explanations for the morphology sampled at Longlin Cave and Maludong. First. it may represent a late-surviving archaic population. perhaps paralleling the situation seen in North Africa as indicated by remains from Dar-es-Soltane and Temara. and maybe …,True,pyPfSkAAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,105,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031918,6940411747007798639,/scholar?cites=6940411747007798639,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031918,0,0,0
1097282,A chronological perspective on the Acheulian and its transition to the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa: the question of the Fauresmith,2011,Andy IR Herries,2011,International Journal of Evolutionary Biology,,,Hindawi,An understanding of the age of the Acheulian and the transition to the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa has been hampered by a lack of reliable dates for key sequences in the region. A number of researchers have hypothesised that the Acheulian first occurred simultaneously in southern and eastern Africa at around 1.7-1.6 Ma. A chronological evaluation of the southern African sites suggests that there is currently little firm evidence for the Acheulian occurring before 1.4 Ma in southern Africa. Many researchers have also suggested the occurrence of a transitional industry. the Fauresmith. covering the transition from the Early to Middle Stone Age. but again. the Fauresmith has been poorly defined. documented. and dated. Despite the occurrence of large cutting tools in these Fauresmith assemblages. they appear to include all the technological components characteristic of the MSA. New data from stratified Fauresmith bearing sites in southern Africa suggest this transitional industry maybe as old as 511–435 ka and should represent the beginning of the MSA as a broad entity rather than the terminal phase of the Acheulian. The MSA in this form is a technology associated with archaic H. sapiens and early modern humans in Africa with a trend of greater complexity through time.,True,pyPfSkAAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,102,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2011/961401.pdf,15647645136830065998,/scholar?cites=15647645136830065998,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2011/961401.pdf,0,0,0

This area has been termed the Gladysvale External Deposit (GVED) and consists of fossil-rich calcified and decalcified sediments. Here we report on the recent analysis of both the faunal material and the geological context of this deposit. The faunal assemblage. excavated from the decalcified sediments contains 29 mammal species including taxa rare or absent in the Witwatersrand Plio-Pleistocene fossil record (e.g. Pelorovis and Kobus leche). Carnivores and porcupines are identified as accumulating agents of the bones. No new hominin findings can be reported from this deposit. and no cultural remains have been recovered. Geologically the calcified and decalcified breccias represent part of a large talus cone that is relatively unexposed. Uniquely for a cave fill in the Witwatersrand hominin-bearing sites. the sediments are horizontally stratified and form a number of flowstone bound sequences.

This study presents a dated molecular supertree for all 34 world pinniped species derived from a weighted matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) supertree analysis of 50 gene trees. each determined under a maximum likelihood (ML) framework. Divergence times were determined by mapping the same sequence data (plus two additional genes) on to the supertree topology and calibrating the ML branch lengths against a range of fossil calibrations. We assessed the sensitivity of our supertree topology in two ways: 1) a second supertree with all mtDNA genes combined into a single source tree. and 2) likelihood-based supermatrix analyses. Divergence dates were also calculated using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock with rate autocorrelation to test the sensitivity of our supertree results further. The resulting phylogenies all agreed broadly with recent molecular studies. in particular supporting the monophyly of Phocidae.

A recent MRP supertree that favoured 'outdated' hypotheses (notably. monophyly of both Artiodactyla and Lipotyphla) has been heavily criticised for including low-quality and redundant data. We apply a stringent data selection protocol designed to minimise these problems to a much-expanded data set of morphological. molecular and combined source trees. to produce a supertree that includes every family of extant placental mammals. The supertree is well-resolved and supports both polyphyly of Lipotyphla and paraphyly of Artiodactyla with respect to Cetacea. The existence of four 'superorders' – Afrotheria. Xenarthra. Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires – is also supported. The topology is highly congruent with recent (molecular) phylogenetic analyses of placental mammals. but is considerably more comprehensive. being the first phylogeny to include all 113 extant families without making a priori assumptions of suprafamilial monophyly. Subsidiary analyses reveal that the data selection protocol played a key role in the major changes relative to a previously published higher-level supertree of placentals. The supertree should provide a useful framework for hypothesis testing in phylogenetic comparative biology. and supports the idea that biogeography has played a crucial role in the evolution of placental mammals.

1097337,Bats that walk: a new evolutionary hypothesis for the terrestrial behaviour of New Zealand's endemic mystacinids,2009,Suzanne J Hand and Vera Weisbecker and Robin MD Beck and Michael Archer and Henk Godthelp and Alan JD Tennyson and Trevor H Worthy,9,BMC Evolutionary Biology,1,1-13,BioMed Central,New Zealand's lesser short-tailed bat Mystacina tuberculata is one of only two of c.1100 extant bat species to use a true walking gait when manoeuvring on the ground (the other being the American common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus). Mystacina tuberculata is also the last surviving member of Mystacinidae. the only mammalian family endemic to New Zealand (NZ) and a member of the Gondwanan bat superfamily Noctilionoidea. The capacity for true quadrupedal terrestrial locomotion in Mystacina is a secondarily derived condition. reflected in numerous skeletal and muscular specializations absent in other extant bats. The lack of ground-based predatory native NZ mammals has been assumed to have facilitated the evolution of terrestrial locomotion and the unique burrowing behaviour of Mystacina. just as flightlessness has arisen independently many times in island birds. New postcranial remains of an early Miocene mystacinid from continental Australia. Icarops aenae. offer an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Several distinctive derived features of the distal humerus are shared by the extant Mystacina tuberculata and the early Miocene Australian mystacinid Icarops aenae. Study of the myology of M. tuberculata indicates that these features are functionally correlated with terrestrial locomotion in this bat. Their presence in I. aenae suggests that this extinct mystacinid was also adapted for terrestrial locomotion. despite the existence of numerous ground-based mammalian predators in Australia during the early Miocene. Thus. it appears that mystacinids were already terrestrially-adapted prior to their isolation in NZ.

In hard-rock aquifers. the heterogeneous hydrologic circulation strongly constrains groundwater residence time. hydrochemistry. and nutrient supply. Here. residence time and a wide range of environmental factors were used to test the influence of groundwater circulation on active microbial community composition. assessed by high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA. Groundwater of different ages was sampled along hydrogeologic paths or loops. in three contrasting hard-rock aquifers in Brittany (France). Microbial community composition was driven by groundwater residence time and hydrogeologic loop position. In recent groundwater. in the upper section of the aquifers or in their recharge zone. surface water inputs caused high nitrate concentration and and the predominance of putative denitrifiers. Although denitrification does not seem to fully decrease nitrate concentrations due to low dissolved organic carbon concentrations. nitrate input has a major effect on microbial communities. The occurrence of taxa possibly associated with the application of organic fertilizers was also noticed. In ancient isolated groundwater. an ecosystem based on Fe(II)/Fe(III) and S/SO4 redox cycling was observed down to several hundred of meters below the surface.

Total microbial community RNA was reversely transcribed and sequenced by pyrosequencing. Characterization of expressed gene sequences provided accurate and detailed information of the composition of the transcriptionally active community and revealed phylogenetic and functional stratifications within the mat. Comparison of 16S rRNA reads and delineation of OTUs showed significantly lower values of metatranscriptomic-based richness and diversity in the upper parts of the mat than in the deeper regions. Taxonomic affiliation of rRNA sequences and mRNA genome recruitments indicated that iron-oxidizing bacteria affiliated to the genus Leptothrix. dominated the community in the upper layers of the mat. Surprisingly. type I methanotrophs contributed to the majority of the sequences in the deep layers of the mat. Analysis of mRNA expression patterns showed that genes encoding the three subunits of the particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoCAB) were the most highly expressed in our dataset.

The link between this trait and phylogenetic relatedness was measured using the Blomberg’s K statistic.Fungal communities were highly diverse. Only ∼1.5% of the 635 OTUs detected were shared by all individuals. however these accounted for 33% of the sequence number. The endophytic fungal communities in plant roots exhibit phylogenetic clustering that can be explained by a plant host effect acting as environmental filter. The ‘mean expression ratio’ displayed significant but divergent phylogenetic signals between fungal phyla.These results suggest that environmental filtering by the host plant favours the co-existence of related and similar OTUs within the Basidiomycota community assembly. whereas the Ascomycota and Glomeromycota communities seem to be impacted by competitive interactions which promote the co-existence of phylogenetically related but ecologically dissimilar OTUs.,True,qsn9TJ8AAAAJ:Nnq8S6OXqDYC,23,https://peerj.com/articles/3454/,9703237296304462873,/scholar?cites=9703237296304462873,,https://peerj.com/articles/3454/,0,0,0

Within this context. alternative solutions to mineral fertilizers such as agricultural biostimulants are thus promoted and being developed. The mechanisms by which some soil biostimulants sustain soil biological functioning and indirectly increase crop yields are still unknown. Our goal in the present study was to demonstrate if and to what extent the application of a soil biostimulant affects the soil heterotrophic microbial communities that are involved in organic matter decomposition and carbon mineralization. We hypothesized that the addition of a biostimulant results in changes in the composition and in the biomass of soil microbial communities. This in turn increases the mineralization of the organic matter derived from crop residues. We performed soil microcosm experiments with the addition of crop residues and a biostimulant. and we monitored the organic carbon (orgC) mineralization and the microbial biomass. along with the microbial community composition by sequencing 16S rRNA gene and ITS amplicons. The addition of a soil biostimulant caused a pH neutralizing effect and simultaneous enhancement of the orgC mineralization of crop residues (+ 400 μg orgC g-1 dry soil) and microbial biomass (+ 60 μg orgC g-1 dry soil) that were linked to changes in the soil microbial communities. Our findings suggest that the soil carbon mineralization enhancement in the presence of the biostimulant was supported by the specific recruitment of soil bacteria and fungi.

Abundances of viral particles and prokaryotes were monitored bi-monthly at a fen and a bog at two different depths. Viral particle abundance ranged from 1.7x106 to 5.6x108 particles mL-1. and did not differ between fen and bog but showed seasonal fluctuations. These fluctuations were positively correlated with prokaryote abundance and dissolved organic carbon. and negatively correlated with water-table height and dissolved oxygen. Using shotgun metagenomics we observed a shift in viral diversity between winter/spring and summer/autumn. indicating a seasonal succession of viral communities. mainly driven by weather-related environmental changes. Based on the seasonal asynchrony between viral and microbial diversity. we hypothesize a seasonal shift in the active microbial communities associated with a shift from lysogenic to lytic lifestyles. Our results suggest that temporal variations of environmental conditions rather than current habitat differences control the dynamics of virus-host interactions in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands.,True,qsn9TJ8AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,8,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01494/full,15526639455540784664,/scholar?cites=15526639455540784664,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01494/full,0,0,0

As all examples of genome reduction characterized so far have been restricted to endosymbionts or pathogens. with a host-dependent lifestyle. the observed genome reduction in Prochlorococcus is the first documented example of such a process in a free-living organism.

Large scale distribution patterns of the different Synechococcus clades (based on 16S rRNA gene markers) suggest the occurrence of two major lifestyles ('opportunists'/'specialists'). corresponding to two distinct broad habitats ('coastal'/'open ocean'). Yet. the genetic basis of niche partitioning is still poorly understood in this ecologically important group. Here. we compare the genomes of 11 marine Synechococcus isolates. representing 10 distinct lineages. Phylogenies inferred from the core genome allowed us to refine the taxonomic relationships between clades by revealing a clear dichotomy within the main subcluster. reminiscent of the two aforementioned lifestyles. Genome size is strongly correlated with the cumulative lengths of hypervariable regions (or 'islands'). One of these. encompassing most genes encoding the light-harvesting phycobilisome rod complexes. is involved in adaptation to changes in light quality and has clearly been transferred between members of different Synechococcus lineages. Furthermore. we observed that two strains (RS9917 and WH5701) that have similar pigmentation and physiology have an unusually high number of genes in common. given their phylogenetic distance.

Groundwater of different ages was sampled along hydrogeologic paths or loops. in three contrasting hard-rock aquifers in Brittany (France). Microbial community composition was driven by groundwater residence time and hydrogeologic loop position. In recent groundwater. in the upper section of the aquifers or in their recharge zone. surface water inputs caused high nitrate concentration and and the predominance of putative denitrifiers. Although denitrification does not seem to fully decrease nitrate concentrations due to low dissolved organic carbon concentrations. nitrate input has a major effect on microbial communities. The occurrence of taxa possibly associated with the application of organic fertilizers was also noticed. In ancient isolated groundwater. an ecosystem based on Fe(II)/Fe(III) and S/SO4 redox cycling was observed down to several hundred of meters below the surface. In this depth section. microbial communities were dominated by iron oxidizing bacteria belonging to Gallionellaceae. The latter were associated to old groundwater with high Fe concentrations mixed to a small but not null percentage of recent groundwater inducing oxygen concentrations …,True,PobhrqMAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,75,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01457/full,10576438743899592974,/scholar?cites=10576438743899592974,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01457/full,0,0,0

Total microbial community RNA was reversely transcribed and sequenced by pyrosequencing. Characterization of expressed gene sequences provided accurate and detailed information of the composition of the transcriptionally active community and revealed phylogenetic and functional stratifications within the mat. Comparison of 16S rRNA reads and delineation of OTUs showed significantly lower values of metatranscriptomic-based richness and diversity in the upper parts of the mat than in the deeper regions. Taxonomic affiliation of rRNA sequences and mRNA genome recruitments indicated that iron-oxidizing bacteria affiliated to the genus Leptothrix. dominated the community in the upper layers of the mat. Surprisingly. type I methanotrophs contributed to the majority of the sequences in the deep layers of the mat. Analysis of mRNA expression patterns showed that genes encoding the three subunits of the particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoCAB) were the most highly expressed in our dataset.

For the latter. identification relies on phylogenetic analyses and the adoption of the phylogenetic species concept. Such analysis requires that the reference sequences are well identified and deposited in public-access databases. However. many entries in the public sequence databases are problematic in terms of quality and reliability and these data require screening to ensure correct phylogenetic interpretation.   Methods and Principal Findings To facilitate phylogenetic inferences and phylogenetic assignment. we introduce a fungal sequence database. The database PHYMYCO-DB comprises fungal sequences from GenBank that have been filtered to satisfy stringent sequence quality criteria. For the first release. two widely used molecular taxonomic markers were chosen: the nuclear SSU rRNA and EF1-α gene sequences. Following the automatic extraction and filtration. a manual curation is performed to remove problematic sequences while preserving relevant sequences useful for phylogenetic studies. As a result of curation. ∼20% of the automatically filtered sequences have been removed from the database. To demonstrate how PHYMYCO-DB can be employed. we test a set of environmental Chytridiomycota sequences obtained from deep sea samples.

Recent studies suggest that they are diverse and well represented in marine and freshwater virioplankton as well as in human microbiomes. Despite previous knowledge. their diversity. abundance and ecological role are completely unknown in soil ecosystems. Here we present the comparative analysis of 17 completely assembled Microviridae genomes from 12 viromes of a Sphagnum-dominated peatland. Phylogenetic analysis of the conserved major capsid protein sequences revealed the affiliation to Gokushovirinae and Pichovirinae as well as to two newly defined subfamilies. the Aravirinae and Stokavirinae. Structural modeling of the Aravirinae major capsid protein showed similarities to Alpavirinae and Pichovirinae but revealed two additional variable regions potentially involved in phage-host recognition. Two new distinct prophages were identified in the genomes of Parabacteroides merdae and Parabacteroides distasonis representing a potential new subfamily of Microviridae. The differentiation of the subfamilies was confirmed by gene order and similarity analysis. Relative abundance analysis using the affiliation of the major capsid protein (VP1) revealed that Gokushovirinae. followed by Aravirinae. are the most abundant Microviridae in 11 out of 12 peat viromes.

However. description and understanding of the rules governing community assembly in the fungal fraction of the plant microbiome remains scarce.We used an innovative DNA- and RNA-based analysis of co-extracted nucleic acids to reveal the complexity of the fungal community colonizing the roots of an Agrostis stolonifera population. The normalized RNA/DNA ratio. designated the ‘mean expression ratio’. was used as a functional trait proxy. The link between this trait and phylogenetic relatedness was measured using the Blomberg’s K statistic.Fungal communities were highly diverse. Only ∼1.5% of the 635 OTUs detected were shared by all individuals. however these accounted for 33% of the sequence number. The endophytic fungal communities in plant roots exhibit phylogenetic clustering that can be explained by a plant host effect acting as environmental filter. The ‘mean expression ratio’ displayed significant but divergent phylogenetic signals between fungal phyla.These results suggest that environmental filtering by the host plant favours the co-existence of related and similar OTUs within the Basidiomycota community assembly. whereas the Ascomycota and Glomeromycota communities seem to be impacted by competitive interactions which promote the co-existence of phylogenetically related but ecologically dissimilar OTUs.,True,PobhrqMAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,23,https://peerj.com/articles/3454/,9703237296304462873,/scholar?cites=9703237296304462873,,https://peerj.com/articles/3454/,0,0,0

Around 150 species have been described and it is becoming clear that many of these species have different functional properties. The species diversity of AM fungi actively growing in roots is therefore an important component of ecosystem diversity. However. it is difficult to identify AM fungi below the genus level from morphology in planta. as they possess few informative characters. We present here a molecular method for identifying infrageneric sequence types that estimate the taxonomic diversity of AM fungi present in actively growing roots.

In turn. their fungal partners enforce cooperation by increasing nutrient transfer only to those roots providing more carbohydrates.

This creates a potential tragedy of the commons where less-mutualistic strains potentially share in the collective benefits. while paying less of the costs. Therefore. maintaining cooperation over the course of evolution requires specific mechanisms that reduce the fitness benefits from “cheating.” Sanctions that discriminate among partners based on actual symbiotic performance are a key mechanism in rhizobia and may exist in many rhizosphere mutualisms. including rhizobia. mycorrhizal fungi. root endophytes. and perhaps free-living rhizosphere microbes.

Seeds were germinated in sterile soil and then exposed to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in current association with naturally infected roots from adults of either the same or different species growing in intact forest. The tree species represent a range of life histories. including early successional pioneers. a persistent understory species. and emergent species. typical of mature forest. Collectively. these experiments show: (i) the seedlings of small‐seeded pioneer species were more dependent on mycorrhizal inocula for initial survival and growth; (ii) although …,True,p9g7ZK0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,189,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00126.x,9812905544420252917,/scholar?cites=9812905544420252917,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/17913/serc_Kiers_etal_2000_EcolLett_3_106_113.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Evolving intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes to encourage farmers’ entrepreneurship and initiatives to develop small seed companies can improve delivery of locally appropriate seeds to poor farmers. not currently offered by the few companies dominating the global seed market (22). Reversing soil infertility through use of locally available resources (eg. nitrogen-fixing trees. indigenous rock phosphate) has increased food security for tens of thousands of African farmers (23). Recent research from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) suggests that total milk spoilage. spillage. etc.. in East Africa and the Near East costs small farmers $90 million/year. Dairy imports to the developing world. which increased 43% between 1998 and 2001. could have been significantly reduced with simple on-farm postharvest technologies (24). Similar investments in affordable technologies (eg. small metallic silos) could prevent rice post-harvest losses ranging between 8 and 26% in China (25). There is a need to capitalize on human ingenuity. deployed for centuries to solve agricultural challenges. Scientists at the African Rice Center are adapting the use of golden weaver ants (a centuries-old technology developed by farmers in Asia) as a pest control method. so West African mango producers can access profitable European markets (26).

Rhizobia are soil bacteria known for fixing nitrogen inside legume root nodules. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous root symbionts that provide plants with nutrients and other benefits. Both kinds of symbionts employ strategies to reproduce during symbiosis using host resources; to repopulate the soil; to survive in the soil between hosts; and to find and infect new hosts. Here we focus on the fitness of the microbial symbionts and how interactions at each of these stages has shaped microbial life-history strategies. During symbiosis. microbial fitness could be increased by diverting more resources to individual reproduction. but that may trigger fitness-reducing host sanctions.

A clear example of an enforcement mechanism is how legumes impose sanctions on rhizobial symbionts that fail to provide sufficient fixed N2. However. with domestication and breeding in high-soil-N environments. humans may have altered these natural legume defences and reduced the agricultural benefits of the symbiosis. Using six genotypes of soya beans. representing 60 years of breeding. we show that. as a group. older cultivars were better able to maintain fitness than newer cultivars (seed production) when infected with a mixture of effective and ineffective rhizobial strains.

Comparison of 16S rRNA reads and delineation of OTUs showed significantly lower values of metatranscriptomic-based richness and diversity in the upper parts of the mat than in the deeper regions. Taxonomic affiliation of rRNA sequences and mRNA genome recruitments indicated that iron-oxidizing bacteria affiliated to the genus Leptothrix. dominated the community in the upper layers of the mat.

Recent studies suggest that they are diverse and well represented in marine and freshwater virioplankton as well as in human microbiomes. Despite previous knowledge. their diversity. abundance and ecological role are completely unknown in soil ecosystems. Here we present the comparative analysis of 17 completely assembled Microviridae genomes from 12 viromes of a Sphagnum-dominated peatland. Phylogenetic analysis of the conserved major capsid protein sequences revealed the affiliation to Gokushovirinae and Pichovirinae as well as to two newly defined subfamilies. the Aravirinae and Stokavirinae. Structural modeling of the Aravirinae major capsid protein showed similarities to Alpavirinae and Pichovirinae but revealed two additional variable regions potentially involved in phage-host recognition. Two new distinct prophages were identified in the genomes of Parabacteroides merdae and Parabacteroides distasonis representing a potential new subfamily of Microviridae.

However. increasing levels of N deposition reduce Sphagnum growth and moss cover. As a consequence. higher amounts of mineral N reach the underlying peat beneath the moss layer. The aim of our work was to determine the effects of supplementary N inputs to peat beneath Sphagnum magellanicum carpets. Peat cores were incubated in controlled laboratory conditions of temperature and humidity. and the impact of increasing N inputs was evaluated on denitrification rates. basal respiration and methane emissions. Rates of denitrification were quickly stimulated by addition of 1 g N m−2 but rates were not significantly elevated in the short-term (9 days) by further additions of up to 10 g N m−2.

This microbiota can thus be considered a toolbox enabling plants to buffer local environmental changes. with a positive influence on plant fitness. In this context. the transmission of the microbiota to the progeny represent a way to ensure the presence of beneficial symbionts within the habitat. Examples of such transmission have been mainly described for seed transmission and concern a few pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated the transmission of symbiotic partners to plant progeny within clonal plant network. We used the clonal plant Glechoma hederacea as plant model and forced newly emitted clonal progeny to root in separated pots while controlling the presence of microorganisms. We used an amplicon sequencing approach of 16S and 18S rRNA targeting bacteria/archaea and fungi respectively to describe the root microbiota of mother and clonal-plant offspring. We demonstrated the vertical transmission of a significant proportion of the mother plants’ symbiotic bacteria and fungi to the daughters. Interestingly. archaea were not transmitted to the daughter plants. Transmitted communities had lower richness. suggesting a filtration during transmission. We found that the transmitted pool of microorganisms was similar among daughters. constituting the heritability of a specific cohort of microorganisms. opening a new understanding of the plant holobiont.

They respond to spatial heterogeneity by changing their internode length or branching frequency. Ramets definitively root in the soil but stay interconnected for a varying period of time thus allowing an exchange of spatial and temporal information. We quantified the foraging response of clonal plants depending on the local soil quality sampled by the rooting ramet (i.e. the present information) and the resource variability sampled by the older ramets (i.e. the past information). We demonstrated that two related species. Potentilla reptans and P. anserina. responded similarly to the local quality of their environment by decreasing their internode length in response to nutrient-rich soil. Only P. reptans responded to resource variability by decreasing its internode length. In both species. the experience acquired by older ramets influenced the plastic response of new rooted ramets: the internode length between ramets depended not only on the soil quality locally sampled but also on the soil quality previously sampled by older ramets. We quantified the effect of the information perceived at different time and space on the foraging behavior of clonal plants by showing a non-linear response of the ramet rooting in the soil of a given quality. These data suggest that the decision to grow a stolon or to root a ramet at a given distance from the older ramet results from the integration of the past and present information about the richness and the variability of the environment.,True,ZmVq5lkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,34,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038288,11504043377575376562,/scholar?cites=11504043377575376562,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038288,0,0,0

Simulations in the literature are often limited to small subsets of the parameter space and are guided by the a priori knowledge and with heuristic aims of the researcher. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the benefit of volunteer computing in computational ecology to systematically browse the parameter space and analyze the simulation results in order to draw rigorous conclusions.

Dordrecht,Clonal architecture may enable plants to effectively respond to environmental constraints but its role in plant tolerance to defoliation remains poorly documented. In several non-clonal species. modifications of plant architecture have been reported as a mechanism of plant tolerance to defoliation. yet this has been little studied in clonal plants. In a glasshouse experiment. five rhizomatous and five stoloniferous species of grazed pastures were subjected to three frequencies of defoliation in order to test two hypotheses. (1) We expected plant clonal response to defoliation to be either a more compact architecture (low clonal propagation. but high branching). or a more dispersed one (long-distance propagation and low branching). Such plastic adjustments of clonal architecture were assumed to be involved in tolerance to defoliation i.e. to promote genet performance in terms of biomass and number of ramets.

Fungi were closely related to manganese-oxidizing genera and seventeen isolates oxidized manganese in culture. producing six distinct manganese-oxide morphologies.

Water‐limited ecosystems are likely to be highly responsive to altered precipitation regimes. The bucket model predicts that increased precipitation variability will reduce soil moisture stress and increase primary productivity and soil respiration in aridland ecosystems. To test this hypothesis. we experimentally altered the size and frequency of precipitation events during the summer monsoon (July through September) in 2007 and 2008 in a northern Chihuahuan Desert grassland in central New Mexico.

Chrysemys picta bellii. one of the most widespread. abundant. and well-studied turtles. We place the genome into a comparative evolutionary context. and focus on genomic features associated with tooth loss. immune function. longevity. sex differentiation and determination. and the species' physiological capacities to withstand extreme anoxia and tissue freezing. Our phylogenetic analyses confirm that turtles are the sister group to living archosaurs. and demonstrate an extraordinarily slow rate of sequence evolution in the painted turtle. The ability of the painted turtle to withstand complete anoxia and partial freezing appears to be associated with common vertebrate gene networks. and we identify candidate genes for future functional analyses. Tooth loss shares a common pattern of pseudogenization and degradation of tooth-specific genes with birds. although the rate of accumulation of mutations is much slower in the painted turtle. Genes associated with sex differentiation generally reflect phylogeny rather than convergence in sex determination functionality. Among gene families that demonstrate exceptional expansions or show signatures of strong natural selection. immune function and musculoskeletal patterning genes are consistently over-represented.

At the level of translation. the pattern of newly synthesized proteins in stationary‐phase cells is surprisingly similar to the pattern of proteins synthesized during exponential growth. When limited for different nutrients. yeast strains may not enter stationary phase but opt for pathways such as pseudohyphal growth.

However. it appears that there are regions of continued gene conversion between the duplicate CRs. resulting in duplications that can be stable for long evolutionary periods.

This is because the concepts are based on experience at particular levels of organization or on systems whose structure is well known. The definitions are thus inadequate for the development of a general theory of ecological disturbance. A universally applicable definition would 1) identify the object disturbed; 2) distinguish between change in the object that is disturbance versus change that is not; and 3) distinguish between direct and indirect consequences of disturbance. To meet these requirements. we formally link the hierarchical organization of ecological objects and the concept of disturbance.

1097630,Woody encroachment decreases diversity across North American grasslands and savannas,2012,Zakary Ratajczak and Jesse B Nippert and Scott L Collins,93,Ecology,4,697-703,Ecological Society of America,Woody encroachment is a widespread and acute phenomenon affecting grasslands and savannas worldwide. We performed a meta‐analysis of 29 studies from 13 different grassland/savanna communities in North America to determine the consequences of woody encroachment on plant species richness. In all 13 communities. species richness declined with woody plant encroachment (average decline = 45%). Species richness declined more in communities with higher precipitation (r2 = 0.81) and where encroachment was associated with a greater change in annual net primary productivity (ANPP; r2 = 0.69). Based on the strong positive correlation between precipitation and ANPP following encroachment (r2 = 0.87). we hypothesize that these relationships occur because water‐limited woody plants experience a greater physiological and demographic release as precipitation increases.

The impact of these short-term phenomena on larger scale ecosystem fluxes is increasingly recognized. and a growing number of studies show that these events affect fluxes of soil gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). methane (CH4). nitrous oxide (N2O). ammonia (NH3) and nitric oxide (NO). Global climate models predict that future climatic change is likely to alter the frequency and intensity of drying-rewetting events and thawing of frozen soils. These future scenarios highlight the importance of understanding how rewetting and thawing will influence dynamics of these soil gases. This study summarizes findings using a new database containing 338 studies conducted from 1956 to 2011. and highlights open research questions. The database revealed conflicting results following rewetting and thawing in various terrestrial ecosystems and among soil gases. ranging from large increases in fluxes to non-significant changes. Studies reporting lower gas fluxes before rewetting tended to find higher post-rewetting fluxes for CO2. N2O and NO; in addition. increases in N2O flux following thawing were greater in warmer climate regions.

Based on a reanalysis and synthesis of 80 site-years for 57 forests. plantations. savannas. shrublands and grasslands from boreal to tropical climates we present evidence that total annual SR is closely related to SR at mean annual soil temperature (SRMAT). irrespective of the type of ecosystem and biome.

Our finding indicates that it can be sufficient to measure SRMAT for obtaining a well constrained estimate of its annual total.

These filaments were found in moist environments in five limestone caves (four in New Mexico. USA. one in Tabasco. Mexico). and a basalt lava tube in the Cape Verde Islands. Most of the filaments are fossils revealed by etching into calcitic speleothems but two are on the surface of samples. One hundred eighty individual reticulated filaments were imaged from 16 different samples using scanning electron microscopy. The filaments are up to 75 цm (average 12 цm) long. but all filaments appear broken. These reticulated filaments are elongate. commonly hollow. tubes with an open mesh reminiscent of a fish net or honeycomb. Two different cross-hatched patterns occur; 77% of filaments have hexagonal chambers aligned parallel to the filament and 23% of filaments have diamond-shaped chambers that spiral along the filament. The filaments range from 300 nm to 1000 nm in diameter. but there are two somewhat overlapping populations; one 200–400 nm in size and the other 500–700 nm. Individual chambers range from 40 to 100 nm with 30–40 nm thick walls. Similar morphologies to the cave reticulated filaments do exist in the microbial world. but all can be ruled out due to the absence of silica (diatoms). different size (diatoms.

1097680,The microbial communities of sulfur caves: a newly appreciated geologically driven system on Earth and potential model for Mars,2006,Penelope J Boston and Louise D Hose and DE Northrup and Michael N Spilde,404,SPECIAL PAPERS-GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,,331,Boulder. Colo.; Geological Society of America; 1999,A handful of investigative teams in several parts of the world are studying abundant biological communities in caves formed by sulfuric-acid speleogenesis. These caves are atypical in terms of origin. chemistry. and ecosystem properties. They prominently display sulfur minerals. characteristic cavity topologies. and notable biological diversity and biological productivity resulting directly from the conditions that produce the caves. Even long-inactive systems still harbor some of these indicators. The microbial and macroscopic ecosystems within sulfuric-acid speleogenetic caves are geologically mediated and maintained. This geological mediation is a theme connecting them with other sulfur-driven ecosystems on Earth. including deep-sea hydrothermal vents. sulfurous near-surface hydrothermal systems. and solfataras. Evidence exists for potentially significant microbial participation in the process of speleogenesis itself. Recent results confirming the high relative abundance of sulfur on Mars. an apparent sedimentary basin with high sulfate concentration. near-surface indicators of ice and water. and trace detection of reduced gases (especially methane) in the Martian atmosphere. possibly deriving from subsurface microbial sources. set the stage for suggesting that sulfuric-acid speleogenetic systems may be useful as astrobiological analogs for hypothetical Mars ecosystems.

Accessible subsurface habitats include lava caves around the world that often support extensive microbial mats on ceilings and walls in a range of colors. Little is known about lava cave microbial diversity and how these subsurface mats differ from microbial communities in overlying surface soils. To investigate these differences. we analyzed bacterial 16S rDNA from 454 pyrosequencing from three colors of microbial mats (tan. white. and yellow) from seven lava caves in Lava Beds National Monument. CA. USA. and compared them with surface soil overlying each cave. The same phyla were represented in both surface soils and cave microbial mats. but the overlap in shared OTUs (operational taxonomic unit) was only 11.2%. Number of entrances per cave and temperature contributed to observed differences in diversity. In terms of species richness. diversity by mat color differed. but not significantly. Actinobacteria dominated in all cave samples. with 39% from caves and 21% from surface soils. Proteobacteria made up 30% of phyla from caves and 36% from surface soil. Other major phyla in caves were Nitrospirae (7%) followed by minor phyla (7%). compared to surface soils with Bacteroidetes (8%) and minor phyla (8%). Many of the most abundant sequences could not be identified to genus. indicating a high degree of novelty. Surface soil samples had more OTUs and greater diversity indices than cave samples.

Carlsbad Caverns National Park. New Mexico. Researchers. concerned cavers. and Carlsbad Caverns National Park Service staff have restored contaminated areas; nevertheless. coliforms persist over time. Investigation of the problem showed that water-siphoning tubing support strong biofilm growth in the same pools in which coliforms are present. suggesting that the biofilm is a factor in coliform persistence. We took a three-pronged approach in exploring this problem: 1) Identification of coliform presence and persistence using+/-coliform indicator quantification tests. 2) Culturing of coliforms in the presence and absence of biofilm to test whether the biofilm enhances coliform growth. and 3) Assessment of biofilm growth on tubing by suspending tubing of varying chemical compositions in cave water. Results indicated that coliform levels exceed those set by the Environmental Protection Agency for drinking-water. Additionally. coliform populations increased in the presence of the biofilm.

Human Indicator Bacteria are those that would not normally be present in a cave unless there has been substantial impact by humans in terms of presence. activities. or pollution. Preliminary study of Human Indicator Bacteria in Lechuguilla Cave compared low impact (alcoves. off-trail sites. non-drinking water pools) with high human impact areas (camps. trade routes. rocks that humans slither over. urine dumps. drinking water sources). Enrichment culture procedures targeted high-temperature Bacillusspp.. Escherichia coli. and Staphylococcus aureus sampled from these sites.

There is variation by cave. but our results show increased levels of Staphylococcus aureus.

A reduction in numbers was seen in Lechuguilla with S. aureus and E. coli if the areas are given a rest from human visitation. Survival of Human Indicator Bacteria under idealized lab conditions in a variety of cave soil types showed that S. aureus died off within two to four weeks.

Mutant ssb1 ssb2 strains grow slowly. contain a low number of translating ribosomes. and are hypersensitive to several inhibitors of protein synthesis. The slow growth phenotype of ssb1 ssb2 mutants is suppressed by increased copy number of a gene encoding a novel translation elongation factor 1α (EF-1α)-like protein.

For example. genome-wide studies and phylogenetic analyses identify genes related in sequence; high-throughput genetic and molecular screens reveal functionally related gene products; and advanced proteomic methods can determine the subunit composition of multi-protein complexes. It is useful for such gene collections to be presented as discrete lists within the appropriate Model Organism Database (MOD) so that researchers can readily access these data alongside other relevant information. To this end.

Radiochemically pure precursors to the small subunit of ribulose-1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase and to the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein have been prepared by in vitro translation of hybrid-selected mRNA and used to study this import process. If chloroplasts are pretreated with the uncoupler nigericin. import does not occur. but the precursors bind to the chloroplast surface. Reincubation of the precursor-chloroplast complex in the presence of ATP results in import of bound precursors. The binding appears to be mediated by proteins of the outer chloroplast envelope membrane because pretreatment of chloroplasts with protease inhibits their ability to bind as well as to import precursors.

This is in part because pure populations of quiescent cells are typically difficult to isolate. We report the isolation and characterization of quiescent and nonquiescent cells from stationary-phase (SP) yeast cultures by density-gradient centrifugation. Quiescent cells are dense. unbudded daughter cells formed after glucose exhaustion. They synchronously reenter the mitotic cell cycle. suggesting that they are in a G0 state. Nonquiescent cells are less dense. heterogeneous. and composed of replicatively older. asynchronous cells that rapidly lose the ability to reproduce.

While these substances are known to produce adverse health effects leading to disease or health problems. the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. To elucidate the processes involved in the toxicity of nickel. cadmium. and chromium at the molecular level and to perform a comparative analysis. H4-II-E-C3 rat liver-derived cell lines were treated with soluble salts of each metal using concentrations derived from viability assays. and gene expression patterns were determined with DNA microarrays. We identified both common and unique biological responses to exposure to the three metals. Nickel. cadmium. chromium all induced oxidative stress with both similar and unique genes and pathways responding to this stress. Although all three metals are known to be genotoxic. evidence for DNA damage in our study only exists in response to chromium.

Its use in many industrial processes and alloys worldwide presents opportunities for occupational exposures. including military personnel. While the toxic effects of cobalt have been widely studied. the exact mechanisms of toxicity remain unclear. In order to further elucidate these mechanisms and identify potential biomarkers of exposure or effect. we exposed two rat liver-derived cell lines. H4-II-E-C3 and MH1C1. to two concentrations of cobalt chloride. We examined changes in gene expression using DNA microarrays in both cell lines and examined changes in cytoplasmic protein abundance in MH1C1 cells using mass spectrometry. We chose to closely examine differentially expressed genes and proteins changing in abundance in both cell lines in order to remove cell line specific effects. We identified enriched pathways. networks. and biological functions using commercial bioinformatic tools and manual annotation. Many of the genes. proteins. and pathways modulated by exposure to cobalt appear to be due to an induction of a hypoxic-like response and oxidative stress. Genes that may be differentially expressed due to a hypoxic-like response are involved in Hif-1α signaling. glycolysis. gluconeogenesis. and other energy metabolism related processes.

Persistent effects of exposure and the mechanism of neuronal degeneration are continuing issues in OP toxicology. To elucidate early steps in the mechanisms of OP toxicity. we studied alterations in global gene and protein expression in Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to OPs using microarrays and mass spectrometry. We tested two structurally distinct OPs (dichlorvos and fenamiphos) and employed a mechanistically different third neurotoxicant. mefloquine. as an out-group for analysis. Treatment levels used concentrations of chemical sufficient to prevent the development of 10%. 50% or 90% of mid-vulval L4 larvae into early gravid adults (EGA) at 24 h after exposure in a defined. bacteria-free medium. After 8 h of exposure. the expression of 87 genes responded specifically to OP treatment. The abundance of 34 proteins also changed in OP-exposed worms. Many of the genes and proteins affected by the OPs are expressed in neuronal and muscle tissues and are involved in lipid metabolism. cell adhesion. apoptosis/cell death. and detoxification. Twenty-two genes were differentially affected by the two OPs; a large proportion of these genes encode cytochrome P450s. UDP-glucuronosyl/UDP-glucosyltransferases. or P-glycoproteins.

However. other mechanisms leading to persistent effects and neurodegeneration remain controversial and difficult to detect. Because Caenorhabditis elegans is relatively resistant to OP lethality—particularly through the inhibition of AChE—studies in this nematode provide an opportunity to observe alterations in global gene expression following OP exposure that cannot be readily observed in less resistant organisms. We exposed cultures of worms in axenic. defined medium to dichlorvos under three exposure protocols. In the first. worms were exposed continuously throughout the experiment. In the second and third. the worms were exposed for either 2 or 8 h. the dichlorvos was washed out of the culture. and the worms were allowed to recover. We then analyzed gene expression using whole genome microarrays from RNA obtained from worms sampled at multiple time points throughout the exposure. The worms showed a time-dependent increase in the expression of genes involved in stress responses. Early in the exposure. the predominant effect was on metabolic processes. while at later times. an immune-like response and cellular repair mechanisms dominated the expression pattern. Following removal of dichlorvos. the gene expression in the worms appeared to relatively rapidly return to steady-state levels. The changes in gene expression observed in the worms following exposure to dichlorvos point towards two potential mechanisms of toxicity: inhibition of AChE and …,True,Gv3j-KwAAAAJ:ShjGdcaqzI0C,32,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-14-291,10470190876698093426,/scholar?cites=10470190876698093426,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-14-291,0,0,0

Metals are widely used in large quantities in a number of industrial processes and are a common environmental toxicant. which increases the possibility of being exposed at toxic levels. While metal toxicity has been widely studied. the exact mechanisms of toxicity remain unclear. In order to further elucidate these mechanisms and identify candidate biomarkers. rats were exposed via a single intraperitoneal injection to three concentrations of CdCl2 and Na2Cr2O7. with livers harvested at 1. 3. or 7 days after exposure. Cd and Cr accumulated in the liver at 1 day post exposure. Cd levels remained elevated over the length of the experiment. while Cr levels declined. Metal exposures induced ROS. including hydroxyl radical (•OH). resulting in DNA strand breaks and lipid peroxidation. Interestingly. ROS and cellular damage appeared to increase with time post-exposure in both metals. despite declines in Cr levels. Differentially expressed genes were identified via microarray analysis.

Platforms using the whole adult organism to evaluate the genome-wide response to toxicants are especially attractive. Recent work demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in vertebrates using the experimentally robust zebrafish model. In the present study. we evaluated gene expression changes in whole adult male zebrafish following an acute 24 hr high dose exposure to three metals with known human health risks. Male adult zebrafish were exposed to nickel chloride. cobalt chloride or sodium dichromate concentrations corresponding to their respective 96 hr LC20. LC40 and LC60. Histopathology was performed on a subset of metal-exposed zebrafish to phenotypically anchor transcriptional changes associated with each metal. Comparative analysis identified subsets of differentially expressed transcripts both overlapping and unique to each metal. Application of gene ontology (GO) and transcription factor (TF) enrichment algorithms revealed a number of key biological processes perturbed by metal poisonings and the master transcriptional regulators mediating gene expression changes. Metal poisoning differentially activated biological processes associated with ribosome biogenesis. proteosomal degradation. and p53 signaling cascades. while repressing oxygen-generating pathways associated with amino acid and lipid metabolism.

The first is the 21 bp glucocorticoid modulatory element (GME) at −3648 bp. which causes reporter constructs to display both a left shift in the dose–response curve for glucocorticoids and increased percentages of agonist activity for antiglucocorticoids. The second is a negative element at −3340 to −3050 that blocks the action of the GME. This last observation raised the question of how GME activity can be expressed in Fu5-5 cells in the intact TAT gene that contains both the GME and the negative element. The present study identifies a third element. a “neutralizing” sequence. that restores the activity of the GME even when otherwise inactivated by the negative element.

It is written in plain language to better inform members of the public and policymakers. The report finds that global warming is unequivocal. primarily human-induced. and its impacts are already apparent in transportation. agriculture. health. and water and energy supplies. These impacts are expected to grow with continued climate change-the higher the levels of greenhouse gas emissions. the greater the impacts. The report illustrates how these impacts can be kept to a minimum if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. The choices we make now will determine the severity of climate change impacts in the future.

Flow may vary between ex-tremes. from high-discharge floods to periods when surface water is absent. Although much is known about the role of floods in shaping ecological processes. far less is known about the biological and chemical changes that occur during periods of water loss in stream ecosystems (Boulton and Suter 1986.

Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loading to river networks is a potentially important source of N2O via microbial denitrification that converts N to N2O and dinitrogen (N2). The fraction of denitrified N that escapes as N2O rather than N2 (i.e.. the N2O yield) is an important determinant of how much N2O is produced by river networks. but little is known about the N2O yield in flowing waters. Here. we present the results of whole-stream 15N-tracer additions conducted in 72 headwater streams draining multiple land-use types across the United States.

Here we identify two linked refining mutations within ISX that interact epistatically to increase binding affinity to the dosage compensation complex. Selection has increased the frequency of this derived haplotype in the population. which is fixed at 30% of ISX insertions and polymorphic among another 41%. Sharing of this haplotype indicates that high levels of gene conversion among ISX elements allow them to ‘crowd-source’ refining mutations. and a refining mutation that occurs at any single ISX element can spread in two dimensions: horizontally across insertion sites by non-allelic gene conversion. and vertically through the population by natural selection.

Here we identify genes with increased copy number on both X and Y chromosomes in various species of Drosophila. a pattern that has previously been associated with sex chromosome drive involving the Slx and Sly gene families in mice. We show that recurrent X/Y co-amplification appears to be an important evolutionary force that has shaped gene content evolution of sex chromosomes in Drosophila. We also demonstrate that convergent acquisition and amplification of testis expressed gene families are common on Drosophila sex chromosomes. and especially on recently formed ones. and we carefully characterize one putative novel X/Y co-amplification system. We find that co-amplification of the S-Lap1/GAPsec gene pair on both the X and the Y chromosome occurred independently several times in members of the D. obscura group. where this normally autosomal gene pair is sex-linked due to a sex chromosome—autosome fusion. We explore several evolutionary scenarios that would explain this pattern of co-amplification. Investigation of gene expression and short RNA profiles at the S-Lap1/GAPsec system suggest that. like Slx/Sly in mice. these genes may be remnants of a cryptic sex chromosome drive system. however additional transgenic experiments will be necessary to validate this model.

Here. we infer how genetically heterogeneous natural systems acquire the same molecular changes to address how genomic background affects adaptation in natural populations. In particular. we take advantage of independently formed neo-sex chromosomes in Drosophila species that have evolved dosage compensation by co-opting the dosage-compensation male-specific lethal (MSL) complex to study the mutational paths that have led to the acquisition of hundreds of novel binding sites for the MSL complex in different species. This complex recognizes a conserved 21-bp GA-rich sequence motif that is enriched on the X chromosome. and newly formed X chromosomes recruit the MSL complex by de novo acquisition of this binding motif. We identify recently formed sex chromosomes in the D. melanica and D. robusta species groups by genome sequencing and generate genomic occupancy maps of the MSL complex to infer the location of novel binding sites. We find that diverse mutational paths were utilized in each species to evolve hundreds of de novo binding motifs along the neo-X. including expansions of microsatellites and transposable element (TE) insertions. However. the propensity to utilize a particular mutational path differs between independently formed X chromosomes and appears to be contingent on genomic properties of that species. such as simple repeat or TE density.

While traditional methods of mutagenesis and selection have been effective in improving production of compounds at a commercial scale. the genetic changes underpinning the altered phenotypes have remained largely unclear. We utilized high-throughput Illumina short read sequencing of a wild Penicillium chrysogenum strain in order to make whole genome comparisons to a sequenced improved strain (WIS 54–1255). We developed an assembly-free method of identifying chromosomal rearrangements and validated the in silico predictions with a PCR-based assay and Sanger sequencing. Despite many rounds of mutagen treatment and artificial selection. WIS 54–1255 differs from its wild progenitor at only one of the identified rearrangements. We suggest that natural variants predisposed for high penicillin production were instrumental in the success of WIS 54–1255 as an industrial strain. In addition to finding a previously published inversion in the penicillin biosynthesis cluster. we located several genes related to penicillin production associated with these rearrangements.

TADs play an important role in regulating gene expression by constraining enhancer-promoter contacts and there is evidence that deletion of TAD boundaries leads to aberrant expression of neighboring genes. While the mechanisms of TAD formation have been well-studied. current knowledge on the patterns of TAD evolution across species is limited. Due to the integral role TADs play in gene regulation. their structure and organization is expected to be conserved during evolution. However. more recent research suggests that TAD structures diverge relatively rapidly. We use Hi-C chromosome conformation capture to measure evolutionary conservation of whole TADs and TAD boundary elements between D. melanogaster and D. triauraria. two early-branching species from the melanogaster species group which diverged ∼15 million years ago. We find that the majority of TADs have been reorganized since the common ancestor of D. melanogaster and D. triauraria. via a combination of chromosomal rearrangements and gain/loss of TAD boundaries. TAD reorganization between these two species is associated with a localized effect on gene expression. near the site of disruption.

We propose that capturing nxf2 sequence allowed TART-A to target the nxf2 gene for piRNA-mediated repression and that these 2 elements are engaged in antagonistic coevolution despite the fact that TART-A is serving a critical role for its host genome.,True,ieeSKDkAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000689,,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000689,0,0,0

They have the same chromosome number and genome sizes. and they occupy the same ecological niche. To explore the basis for this striking conservation of structure and function. we have sequenced the C. briggsae genome to a high-quality draft stage and compared it to the finished C. elegans sequence. We predict approximately 19.500 protein-coding genes in the C. briggsae genome. roughly the same as in C. elegans. Of these. 12.200 have clear C. elegans orthologs. a further 6.500 have one or more clearly detectable C. elegans homologs. and approximately 800 C. briggsae genes have no detectable matches in C. elegans. Almost all of the noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two species. The two genomes exhibit extensive colinearity. and the rate of divergence appears to be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the centers. Operons. a distinctive feature of C. elegans. are highly conserved in C. briggsae. with the arrangement of genes being preserved in 96% of cases. The difference in size between the C. briggsae (estimated at approximately 104 Mbp) and C. elegans (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost entirely due to repetitive sequence. which accounts for 22.4% of the C. briggsae genome in contrast to 16.5% of the C. elegans genome.

The increase in fungal genome sequencing presents an opportunity to reconstruct evolutionary events using entire genomes. As a tool for future comparative. phylogenomic and phylogenetic studies. we used both supertrees and concatenated alignments to infer relationships between 42 species of fungi for which complete genome sequences are available. A dataset of 345.829 genes was extracted from 42 publicly available fungal genomes. Supertree methods were employed to derive phylogenies from 4.805 single gene families. We found that the average consensus supertree method may suffer from long-branch attraction artifacts. while matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) appears to be immune from these. A genome phylogeny was also reconstructed from a concatenated alignment of 153 universally distributed orthologs. Our MRP supertree and concatenated phylogeny are highly congruent. Within the Ascomycota. the sub-phyla Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina were resolved. Both phylogenies infer that the Leotiomycetes are the closest sister group to the Sordariomycetes. There is some ambiguity regarding the placement of Stagonospora nodurum. the sole member of the class Dothideomycetes present in the dataset.

Differences in family size due to lineage-specific gene duplication and gene loss may provide clues to the evolutionary forces that have shaped mammalian genomes. Here we analyze the gene families contained within the whole genomes of human. chimpanzee. mouse. rat. and dog. In total we find that more than half of the 9.990 families present in the mammalian common ancestor have either expanded or contracted along at least one lineage. Additionally. we find that a large number of families are completely lost from one or more mammalian genomes. and a similar number of gene families have arisen subsequent to the mammalian common ancestor. Along the lineage leading to modern humans we infer the gain of 689 genes and the loss of 86 genes since the split from chimpanzees. including changes likely driven by adaptive natural selection.

It occurs as two serotypes (A and D) representing two varieties (i.e. grubii and neoformans. respectively). Here. we sequenced the genome and performed an RNA-Seq-based analysis of the C. neoformans var. grubii transcriptome structure. We determined the chromosomal locations. analyzed the sequence/structural features of the centromeres. and identified origins of replication. The genome was annotated based on automated and manual curation. More than 40.000 introns populating more than 99% of the expressed genes were identified. Although most of these introns are located in the coding DNA sequences (CDS). over 2.000 introns in the untranslated regions (UTRs) were also identified. Poly(A)-containing reads were employed to locate the polyadenylation sites of more than 80% of the genes. Examination of the sequences around these sites revealed a new poly(A)-site-associated motif (AUGHAH). In addition. 1.197 miscRNAs were identified. These miscRNAs can be spliced and/or polyadenylated. but do not appear to have obvious coding capacities. Finally. this genome sequence enabled a comparative analysis of strain H99 variants obtained after laboratory passage.

However. there are as yet no models of gene family evolution that make it possible to estimate ancestral states or to infer upon which lineages gene families have contracted or expanded. In addition. large differences in family size have generally been attributed to the effects of natural selection. without a strong statistical basis for these conclusions. Here we use a model of stochastic birth and death for gene family evolution and show that it can be efficiently applied to multispecies genome comparisons. This model takes into account the lengths of branches on phylogenetic trees. as well as duplication and deletion rates. and hence provides expectations for divergence in gene family size among lineages.

Thus. it is not surprising that genomes for more than 100 filamentous fungi have been sequenced. most of them by Sanger sequencing. While next-generation sequencing techniques have revolutionized genome resequencing. e.g. for strain comparisons. genetic mapping. or transcriptome and ChIP analyses. de novo assembly of eukaryotic genomes still presents significant hurdles. because of their large size and stretches of repetitive sequences. Filamentous fungi contain few repetitive regions in their 30–90 Mb genomes and thus are suitable candidates to test de novo genome assembly from short sequence reads. Here. we present a high-quality draft sequence of the Sordaria macrospora genome that was obtained by a combination of Illumina/Solexa and Roche/454 sequencing. Paired-end Solexa sequencing of genomic DNA to 85-fold coverage and an additional 10-fold coverage by single-end 454 sequencing resulted in ∼4 Gb of DNA sequence.

Similar results are found for colloids suspended in bulk (aqueous) solution. nonaqueous (2-propanol) solution. and reverse (AOT) micelles. This effect is interpreted as modification of midband gap states. probably associated with excess Cd2+. by N (Et) 3 binding. Such states can dominate radiationless decay in Q state materials.

1097849,Photoinduced electron transfer reactions of metal complexes in solution,1980,David G Whitten,13,,3,83-90,American Chemical Society,Molecular or mechanistic photochemistry has been an area of intense activity and rapid advances for 20 years. Early investigations chiefly with organic systems were extended subsequently into reactions of organo-metallics and transition-metal complexes. One of the most important and general processes characterized has been the quenching or generation of an excited state by one-electron transfer reactions. By “quenching” we refer to (usually nonradiative) deacti-vation of an electronically excited molecule (excited state) by bimolecularinteraction with a ground-state molecule (quencher). Among the possible results of such quenching are single electron transfer to or from the excited substrate. excitation energy transfer from excited substrate to quencher. net chemical reaction (in substrate. quencher. or both). and net radiationless decay.

1097885,A method for detecting positive selection at single amino acid sites.,1999,Yoshiyuki Suzuki and Takashi Gojobori,16,Molecular biology and evolution,10,1315-1328,Oxford University Press,A method was developed for detecting the selective force at single amino acid sites given a multiple alignment of protein-coding sequences. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the number of synonymous substitutions. Then. the neutrality was tested for each codon site using the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes throughout the phylogenetic tree. Computer simulation showed that this method accurately estimated the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per site. as long as the substitution number on each branch was relatively small. The false-positive rate for detecting the selective force was generally low. On the other hand. the true-positive rate for detecting the selective force depended on the parameter values. Within the range of parameter values used in the simulation. the true-positive rate increased as the strength of the selective force and the total branch …,True,x_OfflAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,539,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/16/10/1315/2925367,5003298839264717864,/scholar?cites=5003298839264717864,,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/16/10/1315/9592091/mbe1315.pdf,0,0,0

To clarify the overall picture of interspecific gene flow among prokaryotes. we developed a new method for detecting horizontally transferred genes and their possible donors by Bayesian inference with training models for nucleotide composition. Our method gives the average posterior probability (horizontal transfer index) for each gene sequence. with a low horizontal transfer index indicating recent horizontal transfer. We found that 14% of open reading frames in 116 prokaryotic complete genomes were subjected to recent horizontal transfer. Based on this data set. we quantitatively determined that the biological functions of horizontally transferred genes. except mobile element genes. are biased to three categories: cell surface.

One prevalent class of receptors in both plants and animals is the receptor protein kinases. These proteins contain a signal-binding region located outside the cell linked to a region inside the cell called the protein kinase domain. The protein kinase domain transmits information to other cellular components by catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to an amino acid residue on the target proteins. In animals and humans. the well-studied family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) mediates a wide range of signaling events at the cell surface. The importance of receptor protein kinases in plant biology was revealed by the discovery of a family of more than 400 genes coding for receptor-like kinases (RLKs) present in the recently sequenced …,True,q8qVi6sAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,680,https://stke.sciencemag.org/content/2001/113/re22.abstract,2530231830280267035,/scholar?cites=2530231830280267035,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.469.8773&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In this study. we show that expansion coincided with the establishment of land plants and that RLK/Pelle subfamilies were established early in land plant evolution. The RLK/Pelle family expanded at a significantly higher rate than other kinases. due in large part to expansion of a few subfamilies by tandem duplication.

PG activities have been shown to be associated with a wide range of plant developmental programs such as seed germination. organ abscission. pod and anther dehiscence. pollen grain maturation. fruit softening and decay. xylem cell formation. and pollen tube growth. thus illustrating divergent roles for members of this gene family. A close look at phylogenetic relationships among Arabidopsis and rice PGs accompanied by analysis of expression data provides an opportunity to address key questions on the evolution and functions of duplicate genes. We found that both tandem and whole-genome duplications contribute significantly to the expansion of this gene family but are associated with substantial gene losses. In addition. there are at least 21 PGs in the common ancestor of Arabidopsis and rice. We have also determined the relationships between Arabidopsis and rice PGs and their expression patterns in Arabidopsis to provide insights into the functional divergence between members of this gene family. By evaluating expression in five Arabidopsis tissues and during five stages of abscission. we found overlapping but distinct expression patterns for most of the different PGs. Expression data suggest specialized roles or subfunctionalization for each PG gene member. PGs derived from whole genome duplication tend to have more similar expression patterns than those derived from tandem duplications.

In this study. we performed detailed analyses of the inhibitory effects of PGRs on Arabidopsis abscisic acid (ABA) 8'-hydroxylase. a major ABA catabolic enzyme. recently identified as CYP707As. In an in vitro assay with CYP707A3 microsomes expressed in insect cells. uniconazole-P inhibited CYP707A3 activity more effectively than paclobutrazol or tetcyclacis. whereas the other PGRs tested did not inhibit it significantly. Uniconazole-P was found to be a strong competitive inhibitor (K i= 8.0 nM) of ABA 8'-hydroxylase. Uniconazole-P-treated Arabidopsis plants showed enhanced drought tolerance. In uniconazole-P-treated plants. endogenous ABA levels increased 2-fold as compared with the control. and co-application of GA 4 did not suppress the effects. indicating that the effects were not due to gibberellin deficiency.

Seed germination in nlp8 loss-of-function mutants does not respond to nitrate. NLP8 functions even in a nitrate reductase-deficient mutant background. and the requirement for NLP8 is conserved among Arabidopsis accessions.

When one considers that sulfur in plants is only 3% to 5% as abundant as nitrogen. it is perhaps understandable that sulfur assimilation has been less well studied. As a part of the Cys molecule. the sulfur group. called a thiol. is strongly nucleophilic (electrondonating). making it ideally suited for biological redox processes. When oxidized. two Cys molecules can form a covalent linkage called a disulfide bond. which is readily broken by reduction to form two thiol groups. Disulfide 7 dithiol interchange is so versatile that nearly all aerobic forms of life. including plants. have evolved to use this reaction as the dominant form of redox control.

In this study. deep sequencing of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) small RNAs was conducted to reveal miRNAs and other small RNAs that were differentially expressed in response to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. About 3.5 million sequence reads corresponding to 0.6 to 1.2 million unique sequence tags from each Pi-sufficient or Pi-deficient root or shoot sample were mapped to the Arabidopsis genome. We showed that upon Pi deprivation. the expression of miR156. miR399. miR778. miR827. and miR2111 was induced. whereas the expression of miR169. miR395. and miR398 was repressed.

Despite PAs covering one-eighth of the land and being a major focus of nature-based recreation and tourism. we don’t know. To address this. we compiled a globally-representative database of visits to PAs and built region-specific models predicting visit rates from PA size. local population size. remoteness. natural attractiveness. and national income. Applying these models to all but the very smallest of the world’s terrestrial PAs suggests that together they receive roughly 8 billion (8 x 109) visits/y—of which more than 80% are in Europe and North America. Linking our region-specific visit estimates to valuation studies indicates that these visits generate approximately US $600 billion/y in direct in-country expenditure and US $250 billion/y in consumer surplus. These figures dwarf current. typically inadequate spending on conserving PAs. Thus. even without considering the many other ecosystem services that PAs provide to people. our findings underscore calls for greatly increased investment in their conservation.,True,v8V058QAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C,376,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002074,13546673288261324512,/scholar?cites=13546673288261324512,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002074,0,0,0

Cannibalistic parents can either consume their whole brood (total filial cannibalism). or eat only some of the eggs in the nest (partial filial cannibalism). Offspring consumption has been argued to be adaptive under the assumption that offspring survival is traded against feeding. and that offspring can act as an alternative food source for the parents. The evidence supporting the basic predictions formulated under these assumptions is summarized for both total and partial filial cannibalism. These two forms of cannibalism differ significantly since the former represents an investment only in future reproductive success. whereas the latter can affect both present and future reproductive success.

Although several tests of hybridization have been devised. they all rely on the degree to which different modern populations share genetic polymorphisms with the ancient genomes of other hominins. However. spatial population structure is expected to generate genetic patterns similar to those that might be attributed to hybridization. To investigate this problem. we take Neanderthals as a case study. and build a spatially explicit model of the shared history of anatomically modern humans and this hominin. We show that the excess polymorphism shared between Eurasians and Neanderthals is compatible with scenarios in which no hybridization occurred. and is strongly linked to the strength of population structure in ancient populations.

For seven major categories of conservation activity. the CCF tools help clarify conservation objectives and provide a standardized framework that is a …,True,v8V058QAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,195,https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-263X.2008.00025.x,8900558162017483997,/scholar?cites=8900558162017483997,,https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1755-263X.2008.00025.x,0,0,0

Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have demonstrated that heavy particles respond in intricate ways to turbulent fluctuations of the carrying fluid: non-interacting particles may cluster together and form spatial patterns even though the fluid is incompressible. and the relative speeds of nearby particles can fluctuate strongly. Both phenomena depend sensitively on the parameters of the system. This parameter dependence is difficult to model from first principles since turbulence plays an essential role. Laboratory experiments are also very difficult. precisely since they must refer to a turbulent environment.

The prevalent explanation for this is that the cost of additional matings exceeds the benefits of receiving sperm from a large number of males. Here we demonstrate. however. a strongly deviating pattern of polyandry.  Methodology/Principal Findings We analysed paternity in the marine snail Littorina saxatilis by genotyping large clutches (53–79) of offspring from four females sampled in their natural habitats. We found evidence of extreme promiscuity with 15–23 males having sired the offspring of each female within the same mating period.  Conclusions/Significance Such a high level of promiscuity has previously only been observed in a few species of social insects. We argue that genetic bet-hedging (as has been suggested earlier) is unlikely to explain such extreme polyandry. Instead we propose that these high levels are examples of convenience polyandry: females accept high numbers of matings if costs of refusing males are higher than costs of accepting superfluous matings.,True,k5NgF9EAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,62,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009640,15353445216663992200,/scholar?cites=15353445216663992200,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009640,0,0,0
