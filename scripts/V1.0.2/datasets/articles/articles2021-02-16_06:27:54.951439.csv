1043428,Immune suppression of Galleria mellonella (Insecta. Lepidoptera) humoral defenses induced by Steinernema feltiae (Nematoda. Rhabditida): involvement of the parasite cuticle,2002,Maurizio F Brivio and Manuela Pagani and Stefano Restelli,101,Experimental Parasitology,2-3,149-156,Academic Press,Immune depression of Galleria mellonella larvae was evaluated a short time after infection with the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema feltiae. In the host the activity of the enzymatic cascade known as the proPO system was significantly reduced by the presence of either live or dead parasites. The presence of parasites decreased the LPS-elicited proPO system activity. In addition. this process seems to be related to a decrease in the activity of hemolymph proteases. more than to phenoloxidase damage. proPO inhibition was also achieved by injected isolated cuticle fragments. suggesting that the parasite body surface plays an important role in the early parasitation phase.Index Descriptors and Abbreviations: proPO system; Steinernema feltiae.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The extracellular coat surrounding the fish egg. commonly called the chorion. is a primary envelope that confers biochemical and morphological identity typical of the species. Purified chorions can be easily isolated from either oocytes or ovulated eggs. The aim of this work was to analyze the macromolecular composition of the various chorion components in Oncorhynchus mykiss (Salmonids). SDS‐PAGE analysis of purified chorion showed a reproducible pattern of four major components (129. 62. 54. and 47 kD). representing about 80% of total chorion proteins. The 129 and 47 kD polypeptides were periodic‐acid Schiff (PAS) and concanavalin A positive.

We identified a previously unknown missense substitution in ADGRE2 (also known as EMR2). which was predicted to result in the replacement of cysteine with tyrosine at amino acid position 492 (p.C492Y). as the only nonsynonymous variant cosegregating with vibratory urticaria in two large kindreds. The ADGRE2 receptor undergoes autocatalytic cleavage. producing an extracellular subunit that noncovalently binds a transmembrane subunit.

Although predominately activated through antigen-mediated aggregation of IgE-occupied-FcɛRI. they can also be induced to release mediators by other receptors and environmental stimuli. Based on studies conducted in the RBL 2H3 rodent mast cell line. the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) cation channel has been implicated in the activation of mast cells in response to cold and. by inference. the development of urticaria. Here we investigated the expression and role of TRPM8 receptor. in both human and mouse non-transformed cells. with the aim of exploring the potential link between TRPM8 and the pathology of cold urticaria in humans.

Objective To characterize the microcirculatory events that follow mast cell degranulation.   Methodology/Principal Findings Perturbations in dermal blood flow. temperature and skin color were analyzed using laser-speckle contrast imaging. infrared and polarized-light colorimetry following cold-hand immersion (CHI) challenge in patients with cold-induced urticaria compared to the response in healthy controls. Evidence for mast cell degranulation was established by documentation of serum histamine levels and the localized release of tryptase in post-challenge urticarial biopsies. Laser-speckle contrast imaging quantified the attenuated response to cold challenge in patients on cetirizine. We found that the histamine-associated vascular response accompanying mast cell degranulation is rapid and extensive. At the tissue level. it is characterized by a uniform pattern of increased blood flow. thermal warming. vasodilation. and recruitment of collateral circulation. These vascular responses are modified by the administration of an antihistamine.

One of the most critical complications of diabetes is post-prandial hyper-glycemia (PPHG). Glucosidase inhibitor and α-amylase inhibitors are class of compounds that help in managing PPHG. Low-cost herbal treatment is recommended due to their lesser side effect for treatment of diabetes. Two plants with significant traditional therapeutic potential. namely. Gnidia glauca and Dioscorea bulbifera. were tested for their efficiency to inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Stem. leaf. and flower of G. glauca and bulb of D. bulbifera were sequentially extracted with petroleum ether. ethyl acetate. and methanol as well as separately with 70% ethanol. Petroleum ether extract of flower of G. glauca was found to inhibit α-amylase significantly (78.56%). Extracts were further tested against crude murine pancreatic. small intestinal. and liver glucosidase enzyme which revealed excellent inhibitory properties. α-glucosidase inhibition provided a strong in vitro evidence for confirmation of both G. glauca and D. bulbifera as excellent antidiabetic remedy. This is the first report of its kind that provides a strong biochemical basis for management of type II diabetes using G. glauca and D. bulbifera.

In a more unified albeit synthetically challenging strategy. common starting materials would be exposed to a common metal catalysis. leading to a common intermediate and giving rise to different scaffolds by tuning the reactivity of the metal catalyst through different ligands.

In this report. Gnidia glauca leaf and stem extract are used to synthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). As compared to other biological methods. the syntheses were extremely rapid leading to complete reduction within 20 min. Transmission and high resolution transmission electron micrographs clearly indicated that majority of the bioreduced nanoparticles were spherical within a size range of 10 to 60 nm. Exotic shapes like gold nanotriangles and nanohexagons were found in a range between 100 to 300 nm. Dynamic light scattering validated the size range that was observed in TEM and HRTEM. Unique pattern confirming the self-assembly of spheres into anisotropic nanoparticles of larger dimensions was exhibited in HRTEM images. X-ray diffraction pattern and energy dispersive spectroscopic analysis confirmed the purity of elemental gold in the bioreduced nanoparticles.

1043471,Discovery of Novel Targets in the Hedgehog Signaling Pathway,2017,Sumersing Patil,,,,,,A forward chemical genetics approach in order to identify novel modulators of Hh signaling pathway led to identification of three novel inhibitor classes with novel targets in Hh signaling. The identification of proteins involved in Hh signaling regulation sheds light on the complexity of Hh signaling pathway.An osteoblast differentiation assay that monitors Hh pathway activity identified YCL-220 as an inhibitor of Hh signaling. Orthogonal assays revealed YCL-220 as a potent inhibitor of GLI transcription factor-mediated Hh signaling pathway. Mechanistic insights showed that YCL-220 acts as a SMO antagonist that inhibits SMO localization to cilia. similar to vismodegib. The SMO binding of YCL-220 was reversed upon a washout step. thus indicating the non-covalent and reversible mode of SMO binding. The mutations in SMO demands for new strategies to modulate SMO functions. therefore reversible inhibition of SMO by YCL-220 can be further investigated as future SMO targeted strategies.,True,ssB3UrEAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://d-nb.info/1172970955/34,,,,https://d-nb.info/1172970955/34,0,0,0

The concept of ecosystem services incorporates the collective benefits natural systems provide primarily to human beings. It is becoming increasingly important to track the impact that human activities have on the environment in order to determine its resilience and sustainability. The objectives of this paper are to provide an overview of efforts using SWAT to quantify ecosystem services. to determine the model’s capability examining various types of services. and to describe the approach used by various researchers. A literature review was conducted to identify studies in which SWAT was explicitly used for quantifying ecosystem services in terms of provisioning. regulating. supporting. and cultural aspects. A total of 44 peer reviewed publications were identified.

However. a growing number of experimental studies have shown that P losses can occur in drainage water from artificially drained fields. In this review. we assess the applicability of nine models to predict this type of P loss. A model of P movement in artificially drained systems will likely need to account for the partitioning of water and P into runoff. macropore flow. and matrix flow. Within the soil profile. sorption and desorption of dissolved P and filtering of particulate P will be important. Eight models are reviewed (ADAPT. APEX. DRAINMOD. HSPF. HYDRUS. ICECREAMDB.

The yellow (y) gene is required for normal male courtship behavior and subsequent mating success. To better characterize the requirement for y in the manifestation of innate male sexual behavior. we measured the male mating success (MMS) of 12 hypomorphic y mutants and matched-outbred-background controls using a y+ rescue element on a freely segregating minichromosome. We found that 4 hypomorphs significantly reduced MMS to varying degrees. Reduced MMS was largely independent of adult pigmentation patterns.

Knocking down Mef2 expression via RNAi or expressing a repressor form of Mef2 caused flies to lose circadian behavioral rhythms.

P19 dimers appropriate 21-nucleotide (nt) duplex short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by Dicer presumably to prevent programming of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In the context of virus infection. this model predicts that P19 mutants compromised for siRNA binding cannot prevent RISC-mediated degradation of TBSV RNA and thus reduce viral pathogenicity. To test this. we used P19/43 (R→W). which is less pathogenic than wild-type P19 (wtP19). and P19/75-78 (RR→GG). with pathogenicity properties (i.e.. viral spread and symptom induction) comparable to those of a P19-null mutant.

The activity of AO. which catalyses the last step of the synthesis of abscisic acid (ABA). was studied in leaves and roots of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plants grown on nitrate or ammonia with or without salinity. The activity of AO in roots was enhanced in plants grown with ammonium while nitrate-grown plants exhibited only traces.

The contribution to short distance spread in both hosts was strongly influenced by a cluster of charged amino acids between positions 72 and 78 on the 172 amino acid P19. Charged amino acids near this region between positions 43 and 85 were required for long distance spread in pepper.

The SPMV RNA encodes a 17-kDa capsid protein (CP) that is essential for formation of its 16-nm virions. The results of this study indicate that in addition to the expression of the full-length SPMV CP from the 5′-proximal AUG start codon. SPMV RNA also expresses a 9.4-kDa C-terminal protein from the third in-frame start codon. Differences in solubility between the full-length protein and its C-terminal product were observed. Subcellular fractionation of infected plant tissues showed that SPMV CP accumulates in the cytosol. cell wall-. and membrane-enriched fractions.

A major strategy to cope with these replication irregularities is translesion DNA replication (TLS). in which specialized error-prone DNA polymerases bypass the blocking lesions. Recent studies suggest that TLS across a particular DNA lesion may involve as many as four different TLS polymerases. acting in two-polymerase reactions in which insertion by a particular polymerase is followed by extension by another polymerase. Insertion determines the accuracy and mutagenic specificity of the TLS reaction. and is carried out by one of several polymerases such as polη. polκ or polι.

KLF1 expression and activity are tightly controlled in a temporal and differentiation stage-specific manner. The mechanisms by which KLF1 is regulated encompass a range of biological processes. including control of KLF1 RNA transcription. protein stability. localization. and posttranslational modifications. Intact KLF1 regulation is essential to correctly regulate erythroid function by gene transcription and to maintain hematopoietic lineage homeostasis by ensuring a proper balance of erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation. In turn. KLF1 regulates erythroid biology by a wide variety of mechanisms. including gene activation and repression by regulation of chromatin configuration. transcriptional initiation and elongation. and localization of gene loci to transcription factories …,True,OTdYYUUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,66,https://mcb.asm.org/content/33/1/4.short,4385899266838134325,/scholar?cites=4385899266838134325,,https://mcb.asm.org/content/mcb/33/1/4.full.pdf,0,0,0

The initial expression of MP60 during embryonic development of the mouse lens correlates with primary fiber elongation and is first seen on the luminal aspect of the extending cells. About 2 days after birth. the relatively large. antibody-positive macular structures characteristic of late embryonic fiber cells begin to disperse into progressively smaller structures within a centrally located region of the lens. This change in the staining pattern with antibody directed against MP60 is consistent with the dispersion of gap junction plaques as confirmed by freeze fracture analysis. Around 5 days after birth. the 60 kDa gap junctional protein in this central region of the lens undergoes a modification resulting in the alteration to the epitope for the monoclonal antibody and a consequent loss of immunorecognition. Our results suggest that gap junctions in the central region of the developing mouse lens undergo sequential changes in immunoreactivity which may reflect potentially distinct functional phases of intercellular communication.,True,C_Rs8ZUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,27,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8330621,5096614900397229837,/scholar?cites=5096614900397229837,,,0,0,0

Its membrane topology and its N-terminal sequence are similar to those of the connexin family of proteins. Some features of MP70 containing fiber gap junctions are. however. distinct from gap junctions in other mammalian tissues: (i) Lens connexons form crystalline arrays only after cleavage of junctional proteins in vitro. These hexagonal arrays have a periodicity of 13.6 rim. which is significantly larger than the 8- 9-nm spacing of liver and heart gap junctions. (ii) Lens fiber gap junctions dissociate in low concentrations of nonionic detergent and this provides an avenue to purify MP70 directly from a membrane mixture. Isolated MP70 in the form of 17 S structures has an appearance consistent with connexon pairs. (iii) The C-terminal half of MP70 is cleaved in situ by a lens endogenous calcium-dependent protease.

Recently. queen failure has been proposed to be a major driver of managed honey bee colony losses. yet few data exist concerning effects of environmental stressors on queens. Here we demonstrate for the first time that exposure to field-realistic concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides during development can severely affect queens of western honey bees (Apis mellifera). In pesticide-exposed queens. reproductive anatomy (ovaries) and physiology (spermathecal-stored sperm quality and quantity). rather than flight behaviour. were compromised and likely corresponded to reduced queen success (alive and producing worker offspring).

However. it is not yet clear if venereal–vertical transmission represents a regular mode of transmission for this virus in natural honey bee populations. Here. we provide clear evidence for the occurrence of high DWV titres in the endophallus of sexually mature drones collected from drone congregation areas (DCAs). Furthermore. the endophallus DWV titres of drones collected at their maternal hives were no different from drones collected at nearby DCAs. suggesting that high-titre DWV infection of the endophallus does not hinder the ability of drones to reach the mating area.

1043546,Sex-specific differences in pathogen susceptibility in honey bees (Apis mellifera),2014,Gina Retschnig and Geoffrey R Williams and Marion M Mehmann and Orlando Yañez and Joachim R De Miranda and Peter Neumann,9,PLoS One,1,e85261,Public Library of Science,Sex-related differences in susceptibility to pathogens are a common phenomenon in animals. In the eusocial Hymenoptera the two female castes. workers and queens. are diploid and males are haploid. The haploid susceptibility hypothesis predicts that haploid males are more susceptible to pathogen infections compared to females. Here we test this hypothesis using adult male (drone) and female (worker) honey bees (Apis mellifera). inoculated with the gut endoparasite Nosema ceranae and/or black queen cell virus (BQCV). These pathogens were chosen due to previously reported synergistic interactions between Nosema apis and BQCV. Our data do not support synergistic interactions between N. ceranae and BQCV and also suggest that BQCV has limited effect on both drone and worker health. regardless of the infection level. However. the data clearly show that. despite lower levels of N. ceranae spores in drones than in workers. Nosema-infected drones had both a higher mortality and a lower body mass than non-infected drones. across all treatment groups. while the mortality and body mass of worker bees were largely unaffected by N. ceranae infection. suggesting that drones are more susceptible to this pathogen than workers. In conclusion. the data reveal considerable sex-specific differences in pathogen susceptibility in honey bees and highlight the importance of ultimate measures for determining susceptibility. such as mortality and body quality. rather than mere infection levels.,True,ILGDoYkAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,43,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085261,14086972527766143191,/scholar?cites=14086972527766143191,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085261,0,0,0

1043547,Presence of Nosema ceranae in Africanized honey bee colonies in Costa Rica.,2008,Rafael A Calderón and Luis A Sanchez and Orlando Yañez and Natalia Fallas,47,Journal of apicultural research,4,328,,Nosemosis is a severe disease caused by the microsporidian Nosema sp. affecting adult honey bees (Apis mellifera)(Bailey and Ball. 1991). Nosema spores infect the epithelial layer of the ventriculus and midgut of adult bees. causing digestive disorders and shortening the life span of bees. with a resulting decrease in bee population (Ritter. 2001). So far only two microsporidian parasites have been described in honey bees: N. apis and N. ceranae. Nosema apis was the first described microsporidian in honey bees (Zander. 1909). Nosema ceranae was first described in colonies of the Asian hive bee (A. cerana)(Fries et al.. 1996). but recently it was found in A. mellifera colonies in both Taiwan and Europe (Higes et al.. 2006). Very few data are available about the spread of N. ceranae in Africanized honey bees (AHB)(A. mellifera scutellata)(Klee et al.. 2007). N. apis is known to be distributed in honey bees worldwide (Matheson. 1993). Spores produced by the two Nosema species are quite similar and very difficult to distinguish using traditional light microscopic analysis. Molecular tools have been developed to improve accurate diagnosis of Nosema disease in the laboratory (Higes et al.. 2006; Klee et al.. 2007; Paxton et al.. 2007). Here we used PCR techniques in order to characterize infections or co-infections by these two pathogens in AHB colonies in Costa Rica. Prior to PCR analysis. spores were visually detected in adult bee samples using light microscopy.In our study. conducted between August and December 2006. 262 AHB colonies from different areas of Costa Rica were randomly sampled for Nosema spp. Most samples were taken …,True,ILGDoYkAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,41,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Orlando_Yanez/publication/250278818_Presence_of_Nosema_ceranae_in_Africanized_honey_bee_colonies_in_Costa_Rica/links/5735eb3308ae9f741b29c5ff/Presence-of-Nosema-ceranae-in-Africanized-honey-bee-colonies-in-Costa-Rica.pdf,11561318577495749535,/scholar?cites=11561318577495749535,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Orlando_Yanez/publication/250278818_Presence_of_Nosema_ceranae_in_Africanized_honey_bee_colonies_in_Costa_Rica/links/5735eb3308ae9f741b29c5ff/Presence-of-Nosema-ceranae-in-Africanized-honey-bee-colonies-in-Costa-Rica.pdf,0,0,0

A growing number of viruses have been documented in the western honey bee. Apis mellifera. Several of these contribute significantly to honey bee colony losses. This review synthetizes the knowledge of the diversity and distribution of honey-bee-infecting viruses. including recent data from high-throughput sequencing (HTS). After presenting the diversity of viruses and their corresponding symptoms. we surveyed the scientific literature for the prevalence of these pathogens across the globe. The geographical distribution shows that the most prevalent viruses (deformed wing virus. sacbrood virus. black queen cell virus and acute paralysis complex) are also the most widely distributed. We discuss the ecological drivers that influence the distribution of these pathogens in worldwide honey bee populations. Besides the natural transmission routes and the resulting temporal dynamics. global trade contributes to their dissemination. As recent evidence shows that these viruses are often multihost pathogens. their spread is a risk for both the beekeeping industry and the pollination services provided by managed and wild pollinators.

While laboratory data repeatedly show significant propolis effects. field data are scarce. especially at the colony level. Here. we investigated whether propolis. as naturally deposited in the nests. can protect honeybees against ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and associated viruses. which are currently considered the most serious biological threat to European honeybee subspecies. Apis mellifera. globally. Propolis intake of 10 field colonies was manipulated by either reducing or adding freshly collected propolis. Mite infestations. titers of deformed wing virus (DWV) and sacbrood virus (SBV). resin intake. as well as colony strength were recorded monthly from July to September 2013. We additionally examined the effect of raw propolis volatiles on mite survival in laboratory assays. Our results showed no significant effects of adding or removing propolis on mite survival and infestation levels. However. in relation to V. destructor. DWV titers increased significantly less in colonies with added propolis than in propolis-removed colonies. whereas SBV titers were similar. Colonies with added propolis were also significantly stronger than propolis-removed colonies. These findings indicate that propolis may interfere with the dynamics of V. destructor-transmitted viruses. thereby further emphasizing the importance of propolis for honeybee health.

The benthos of the Disko Fjord on the west coast of Disko Island (West Greenland) was sampled using a van-Veen grab. Benthos communities were distinguished by cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. The zonation pattern mainly reflects a bathymetrical gradient. but the spatial distribution of the fauna is also influenced by the strong aestival river runoff at the origin of the fjord.

Static bioassays were conducted and TL50 calculations made. In addition. the embryos were examined for the presence of developmental anomalies. The mean 96 h TL50 for eggs was 54 mg/litre. The early (<3·5h) and late (>192 h) stages were more sensitive than the average. The newly hatched fry were not as sensitive to toluene as were the embryos.In addition to acute toxicity effects. concentrations of toluene as low as 41 mg/litre produced teratogenic effects in susceptible embryos.

With the exception of the finished water taken at one treatment plant in which the total concentration of the six PAH was 138.5 parts per trillion (ppt). the total initial concentration in all other treated water ranged from 0 to 13.4 ppt. The corresponding total PAH concentration in water after passage through the distribution pipes varied from 0 to 61.6 ppt.

In this communication we describe the identification. in the genome of S. aureus strain COL. of two co-transcribed genes. murT and gatD. which are responsible for peptidoglycan amidation. MurT and GatD have sequence similarity to substrate-binding domains in Mur ligases (MurT) and to the catalytic domain in CobB/CobQ-like glutamine amidotransferases (GatD). The amidation of glutamate residues in the stem peptide of S. aureus peptidoglycan takes place in a later step than the cytoplasmic phase – presumably the lipid phase - of the biosynthesis of the S. aureus cell wall precursor.

Peptidoglycan. the principal constituent of virtually all bacterial surfaces. is a specific molecular signature recognized by dedicated host receptors. present in animals and plants. which trigger an immune response. Here we report that autolysins from Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. enzymes capable of hydrolyzing peptidoglycan. have a major role in concealing this inflammatory molecule from Drosophila peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). We show that autolysins trim the outermost peptidoglycan fragments and that in their absence bacterial virulence is impaired. as PGRPs can directly recognize leftover peptidoglycan extending beyond the external layers of bacterial proteins and polysaccharides. The activity of autolysins is not restricted to the producer cells but can also alter the surface of neighboring bacteria. facilitating the survival of the entire population in the infected host.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02277.001,True,drFaFp8AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,46,https://elifesciences.org/articles/02277,9013788505631687945,/scholar?cites=9013788505631687945,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/02277.pdf,0,0,0

The introduction of mecA into the S. aureus chromosome has led to the emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) pandemics. responsible for high rates of mortality worldwide. Nonetheless. little is known regarding the origin and evolution of mecA. Different mecA homologues have been identified in species belonging to the Staphylococcus sciuri group representing the most primitive staphylococci. In this study we aimed to identify evolutionary steps linking these mecA precursors to the β-lactam resistance gene mecA and the resistance phenotype. We sequenced genomes of 106 S. sciuri. S. vitulinus and S. fleurettii strains and determined their oxacillin susceptibility profiles. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of the core genome was performed to assess the genetic relatedness of the isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the mecA gene homologues and promoters was achieved through nucleotide/amino acid sequence alignments and mutation rates were estimated using a Bayesian analysis. Furthermore. the predicted structure of mecA homologue-encoded PBPs of oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were compared. We showed for the first time that oxacillin resistance in the S. sciuri group has emerged multiple times and by a variety of different mechanisms.

1043637,A morphometric and genetic comparison of Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea. 1834) populations: does shape really matter?,2014,Irene Guarneri and Oana Paula Popa and Laura Gola and Lyudmila Kamburska and Rosaria Lauceri and Manuel Lopes-Lima and Luis Ovidiu Popa and Nicoletta Riccardi,9,Aquatic Invasions,2,,,Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea. 1834) is an invasive species which has spread rapidly across Europe over the last few decades. Although it is already well established throughout Italy (both in lakes and in rivers). during a regular monitoring of the mussel communities in Northern Italy. this species was found for the first time in the fluvial natural reserve of Ghiaia Grande (Po River basin). The strong differences in shell shape between these specimens and those from Lake Maggiore prompted a genetic comparison based on DNA barcoding analyses to establish whether specimens from both sites belong to the same species. Our results confirm that the wide shell plasticity may help to explain the role of environmental factors in driving shells’ morphology. Additionally. it may also induce S. woodiana misidentification with the native Anodonta sp. This fact may have strong negative implications for freshwater conservation if on one hand. the native species distribution is falsely over represented; or on the other hand. if the invasive species has a much wider distribution than predicted.,True,STEVjW8AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,25,https://www.reabic.net/aquaticinvasions/2014/AI_2014_Guarneri_etal.pdf,3746603243545678577,/scholar?cites=3746603243545678577,,https://www.reabic.net/aquaticinvasions/2014/AI_2014_Guarneri_etal.pdf,0,0,0

An example is the Pontocaspian biota. The mostly endemic invertebrate faunas that evolved in the Black Sea–Caspian Sea–Aral Sea region and live under variable salinity conditions are undergoing strong change. yet within several groups species boundaries are not well established. Collection efforts in the past decade have failed to produce living material of various species groups whose taxonomic status is unclear. This lack of data precludes an integrated taxonomic assessment to clarify species identities and estimate species richness of Pontocaspian biota combining morphological. ecological. genetic. and distribution data.

1043652,History's affective turn: Historical reenactment and its work in the present,2007,Vanessa Agnew,11,Rethinking history,3,299-312,Routledge,The article argues that contemporary reenactment is indicative of history's recent affective turn. i.e. of historical representation characterized by conjectural interpretations of the past. the collapsing of temporalities and an emphasis on affect. individual experience and daily life rather than historical events. structures and processes. The affective turn signals a break with the kind of ethical and political responsibilities that adhered to some postwar historiography. The article makes this argument in reference to recent German historical reality television series. including Abenteuer 1900. Abenteuer 1927. and Windstärke 8: Das Auswandererschiff. While their format is similar to that of the Wall to Wall House series. resulting in a certain leveling of historical and geographical specificity. the article shows that the German reenactment series use history as a conceit for performing a particular form of cultural and political work …,True,XBhvaO4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,313,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13642520701353108,1924193973021729702,/scholar?cites=1924193973021729702,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vanessa_Agnew/publication/248991060_History%27s_Affective_Turn_Historical_Reenactment_and_Its_Work_in_the_Present/links/54e2437d0cf2c3e7d2d34b87.pdf,0,0,0

1043653,Introduction: what is reenactment?,2004,Vanessa Agnew,,Criticism,,327-339,Wayne State University Press,"As anyone who has swabbed decks and gone aloft knows. reenactment is fun. It indulges the twin passions of work and play. which are generally divorced from each other. It licenses dressing up. pretending and improvising. casting oneself as the protagonist of one's own research. and getting others to play along. Of course. it also calls for discomfort and enforced self-growth. But. like the cold nose atop the counterpane. which Melville says measures the warmth of the bed. the pain only sharpens the pleasure. 1 Iain McCalman's piece in this issue."" The Little Ship of Horrors."" shows that suffering also makes for a better story.

1043654,Enlightenment Orpheus: The power of music in other worlds,2008,Vanessa Agnew,,,,,Oxford University Press,The Enlightenment saw a critical engagement with the ancient idea that music carries certain powers-it heals and pacifies. civilizes and educates. Yet this interest in musical utility seems to conflict with larger notions of aesthetic autonomy that emerged at the same time. In Enlightenment Orpheus. Vanessa Agnew examines this apparent conflict. and provocatively questions the notion of an aesthetic-philosophical break between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Agnew persuasively connects the English traveler and music scholar Charles Burney with the ancient myth of Orpheus. She uses Burney as a guide through wide-ranging discussions of eighteenth-century musical travel. views on music's curative powers. interest in non-European music. and concerns about cultural identity. Arguing that what people said about music was central to some of the great Enlightenment debates surrounding such issues as human agency. cultural difference. and national identity. Agnew adds a new dimension to postcolonial studies. which has typically emphasized the literary and visual at the expense of the aural. She also demonstrates that these discussions must be viewed in context at the era's broad and well-entrenched transnational network. and emphasizes the importance of travel literature in generating knowledge at the time. A new and radically interdisciplinary approach to the question of the power of music-its aesthetic and historical interpretations and political uses-Enlightenment Orpheus will appeal to students and scholars in historical musicology. ethnomusicology.

In a period of government-sponsored scientific voyages and expeditions. it was European encounters with the Pacific that gave rise to a wealth of new data about islands and island peoples. succeeding an earlier preoccupation with the Indies. East and West. This renewed interest in islands spawned an array of literary treatments. from Defoe to Diderot and Kotzebue. which transposed critiques of domestic phenomena to the South Seas.The late eighteenth-century engagement with the Pacific was. however. also coterminous with the inception of a biological discourse about race that conflated physiognomy with moral attributes and constructed human difference as something ‘ultimate and irreducible'(Gates 1985: 5). Associated with the colonial project. racial discourse has been seen as something that both prompted and legitimised European intervention in the Pacific.

Strictly speaking. the settlers in New Zealand are second settlers. Maori peoples are not autochthonous. but have been settled in New Zealand for around 1200 years. The key element of the indigenous claim to sovereignty is therefore anteriority. or being-before. The disavowal of the anteriority of Maori peoples. and of the Maori claim to place on that basis. makes the position of second settlers tenuous. Thanks to official biculturalism. they can imagine that as New Zealanders they are Maori as well as non-Maori (Pakeha).

Malnutrition is recognized as a confounding factor in oxidative stress. However. little is known about effect of malnutrition on oxidative stress induced by BPA or other endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). We studied effect of malnutrition (iron deficiency) in rats chronically exposed to low levels of BPA taking into consideration the oxidative stress and antioxidant status in liver. kidney and gonads. Iron deficiency significantly elevated level of lipid peroxidation in BPA-exposed rats. Similarly. decrease in reduced glutathione level was more significant in rats maintained on iron deficient diet compared to those maintained on normal diet. Iron deficiency also significantly modulated activities of vital antioxidant enzymes in all the tissues.

The etiopathogenesis of ALD is related to ethanol-induced oxidative stress. glutathione reduction. abnormal methionine metabolism. malnutrition. and production of endotoxins that activate Kupffer cells. Curcumin is an active ingredient of the rhizome of turmeric. The substance is shown to have minor adverse effects. As the substance possess low bioavailability in free formulation. different strategies has been conducted to improve its bioavailability which resulted in production of nanomiscels and nanoparticles. Curcumin can provide protection for the liver against toxic effects of alcohol use. Several studies showed curcumin blocks endotoxin-mediated activation of NF-ÎºB and suppresses the expression of cytokines. chemokines. COX-2. and iNOS in Kupffer cells. According to the molecular studies. curcumin inhibits NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. regulates cytokines production and modulates immune response.

A subsidy of bioavailable phosphorus excreted by dreissenid mussels could be an important mechanism facilitating the growth of C. glomerata. To assess the importance of phosphorus released by mussels to C. glomerata growth in the nearshore. we conducted a survey of mussel distribution and abundance followed by in situ experiments designed to measure dreissenid phosphorus excretion rates. Average dreissenid mussel abundance in our study area was 3674 individuals/m2. with an average biomass of 52.2 g of shell free dry mass/m2.

Siberia,2014,Stephanie E Hampton and Derek K Gray and Lyubov R Izmest'eva and Marianne V Moore and Tedy Ozersky,9,PloS one,2,e88920,Public Library of Science,Both surface water temperatures and the intensity of thermal stratification have increased recently in large lakes throughout the world. Such physical changes can be accompanied by shifts in plankton community structure. including changes in relative abundances and depth distributions. Here we analyzed 45 years of data from Lake Baikal. the world's oldest. deepest. and most voluminous lake. to assess long-term trends in the depth distribution of pelagic phytoplankton and zooplankton. Surface water temperatures in Lake Baikal increased steadily between 1955 and 2000. resulting in a stronger thermal gradient within the top 50 m of the water column. In conjunction with these physical changes our analyses reveal significant shifts in the daytime depth distribution of important phytoplankton and zooplankton groups. The relatively heavy diatoms. which often rely on mixing to remain suspended in the photic zone. shifted downward in the water column by 1.90 m y-1. while the depths of other phytoplankton groups did not change significantly. Over the same time span the density-weighted average depth of most major zooplankton groups. including cladocerans. rotifers. and immature copepods. exhibited rapid shifts toward shallower positions (0.57–0.75 m y−1). As a result of these depth changes the vertical overlap between herbivorous copepods (Epischura baikalensis) and their algal food appears to have increased through time while that for cladocerans decreased. We hypothesize that warming surface waters and reduced mixing caused these ecological changes.

We combined information about pre- and postdreissenid abundance. biomass. and secondary production of the littoral benthos with results of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of archival (predreissenid) and recent (postdreissenid) samples of all common benthic taxa. This approach enabled us to determine the importance of benthic and sestonic carbon to the littoral food web before. and more than a decade after dreissenid establishment. Long term dreissenid presence was associated with a 32-fold increase in abundance. 6-fold increase in biomass. and 14-fold increase in secondary production of the littoral benthos. Dreissenids comprised a large portion of the post-invasion benthos. making up 13. 38. and 56% of total abundance. biomass. and secondary production. respectively. The predreissenid food web was supported primarily by benthic primary production. while sestonic material was relatively more important to the postdreissenid food web. The absolute importance of both sestonic material and benthic primary production to the littoral benthos increased considerably following dreissenid establishment. Our results show drastic alterations to food web structure and suggest that dreissenid mussels redirect energy and material from the water column to the littoral benthos both through biodeposition of sestonic material as well as stimulation of benthic primary production.,True,4qU2dFEAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,42,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051249,1554640006047553048,/scholar?cites=1554640006047553048,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051249,0,0,0

CCM occurs either sporadically or in an inherited. autosomal dominant manner. Constitutional (germline) mutations in any of three genes. KRIT1. CCM2 and PDCD10. can cause the inherited form. Analysis of CCM lesions from inherited cases revealed biallelic somatic mutations. indicating that CCM follows a Knudsonian two-hit mutation mechanism. It is still unknown. however. if the sporadic cases of CCM also follow this genetic mechanism. We extracted DNA from 11 surgically excised lesions from sporadic CCM patients. and sequenced the three CCM genes in each specimen using a next-generation sequencing approach.

1043706,Factors that control run-ahead on printing presses,1999,J Hamel and A Menard and D McDonald,,,,,Oklahoma State University,Run-ahead is a problem that occurs on printing presses where the paper rolls are braked by metallic bands applied to their periphery. Run-ahead occurs when the web in contact with the band decelerates faster than the roll. or when the web stops completely but the roll continues to rotate. This leads to a bubble. or bunching of paper layers. on the ingoing side of the bands. This breaks the web. A model has been developed to characterize run-ahead that takes into account press operating conditions. as well as paper and roll properties. The model shows that run-ahead depends on the press parameters of wrap angle. deceleration rate. and unwinding tension. It depends on paper parameters such as paper-to-paper coefficient of friction (COF). paper-to-band COF. wound-in tension. and the mass of the roll. We found that the paper-to-band COF increases significantly due to contamination of the band from the paper. and could be a determinant in the run-ahead problem. The probability of run-ahead can be reduced by increasing the wrap angle between the braking band and the paper roll. reducing the rate of deceleration. reducing the web tension on the press. or by increasing the wound-in tension. The key factors are the static paper-to-paper COF and the dynamic COF between the paper and the band material. Increasing the paper-to-paper COF will not be effective if there is also a proportional increase in the paper-to-band COF. so care must be taken when evaluating possible additives or treatments.,True,cX_w_k0AAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC,7,https://shareok.org/handle/11244/321774,13452964562770324895,/scholar?cites=13452964562770324895,,https://shareok.org/bitstream/handle/11244/321774/oksd_icwh_1999_hamel.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

However. little is known about how CLK levels are controlled. Here we show that Clk mRNA is strongly regulated post-transcriptionally through its 3′ UTR. Flies expressing Clk transgenes without normal 3′ UTR exhibit variable CLK-driven transcription and circadian behaviour as well as ectopic expression of CLK-target genes in the brain. In these flies. the number of the key circadian neurons differs stochastically between individuals and within the two hemispheres of the same brain. Moreover. flies carrying Clk transgenes with deletions in the binding sites for the miRNA bantam have stochastic number of pacemaker neurons. suggesting that this miRNA mediates the deterministic expression of CLK.

We used computational design methods to predict and optimize a total of 53 cyclic and linear peptides targeting myeloid differentiation 2 (MD2) and cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14). both coreceptors of human TLR4. Activity of the designed peptides was first assessed using NF-κB reporter cell lines expressing either TLR4/MD2 or TLR4/CD14 receptors. then binding to CD14 and MD2 confirmed and quantified using MicroScale Thermophoresis. Finally. we incubated select peptides in human whole blood and observed their ability to induce cytokine production. either alone or in synergy …,True,tyazjE4AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,9,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/201/11/3383.abstract,4416357634022251884,/scholar?cites=4416357634022251884,,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/201/11/3383.full.pdf,0,0,0

Protein Res.,,117-131,,While machine learning techniques have greatly increased molecular modeling capabilities. the frequent reliance on stochastic algorithms is a limiting factor due to slow optimization processes. Faster algorithms are thus sought for large scope projects. Nevertheless. stochastic algorithms also provide a distinct advantage by providing a solution ensemble rather than a single optimal solution. Producing a large ensemble of solutions is critical in problems where not all solution aspects are predictable and unpredictable properties may be key to ultimate success. Similar problems have been tackled previously before the advent of machine learning. in the field of finance. In 1952. Harry Markowitz introduced the modern portfolio theory (MPT). which uses the heuristics of risk and return to optimize a financial portfolio.

However. exhaustion of antigen-specific T cells represents a major challenge to this type of approach. In an effort to overcome this problem. we reprogrammed clonally expanded antigen-specific CD8+ T cells from an HIV-1-infected patient to pluripotency. The T cell-derived induced pluripotent stem cells were then redifferentiated into CD8+ T cells that had a high proliferative capacity and elongated telomeres. These “rejuvenated” cells possessed antigen-specific killing activity and exhibited T cell receptor gene-rearrangement patterns identical to those of the original T cell clone from the patient. We also found that this method can be effective for generating specific T cells for other pathology-associated antigens.

We attempted to dissect early developmental stages of HSCs using an in vitro mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation system combined with inducible HOXB4 expression. Here we report the identification of pre-HSCs and an embryonic type of HSCs (embryonic HSCs) as intermediate cells between ESCs and HSCs. Both pre-HSCs and embryonic HSCs were isolated by their c-Kit+CD41+CD45− phenotype. Pre-HSCs did not engraft in irradiated adult mice. After co-culture with OP9 stromal cells and conditional expression of HOXB4. pre-HSCs gave rise to embryonic HSCs capable of engraftment and long-term reconstitution in irradiated adult mice. Blast colony assays revealed that most hemangioblast activity was detected apart from the pre-HSC population. implying the early divergence of pre-HSCs from hemangioblasts. Gene expression profiling suggests that a particular set of transcripts closely associated with adult HSCs is involved in the transition of pre-HSC to embryonic HSCs.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Current data provide compelling evidence that the pH of the interstitial fluid of cartilage is an important determinant of the metabolic activity of chondrocytes. and this has served as the basis for a mechanistic proposal whereby chondrocytes could sense mechanical compression. The objective of the current study was to test this hypothesis further by examining biosynthetic activity in cartilage as a function of glycosaminoglycan content. which is the major determinant of interstitial pH. On the basis of previous data. increased biosynthetic activity would be anticipated to correlate with a decreased glycosaminoglycan content and an elevated interstitial pH. In contrast to our expectations. we found that the biosynthetic activity (monitored by measurement of incorporation of sulfate and proline) was positively correlated with the glycosaminoglycan content of tissue.

As such. ectopic expression of neuronal microRNAs (miRNAs). miR-9/9∗ and miR-124 (miR-9/9∗-124) in adult human fibroblasts has been found to evoke extensive reconfigurations of the chromatin and direct the fate conversion to neurons. However. how miR-9/9∗-124 break the cell fate barrier to activate the neuronal program remains to be defined. Here. we identified an anti-neurogenic function of EZH2 in fibroblasts that acts outside its role as a subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 to directly methylate and stabilize REST. a transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes. During neuronal conversion. miR-9/9∗-124 induced the repression of the EZH2-REST axis by downregulating USP14. accounting for the opening of chromatin regions harboring REST binding …,True,We4f7hsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,34,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580718304611,15086099860533643816,/scholar?cites=15086099860533643816,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580718304611,0,0,0

Recent research has revealed that α-synuclein is not just an intracellular synaptic protein but also exists extracellularly. Moreover. the transfer of misfolded α-synuclein between cells might be a crucial step in the process leading to a progressive increase in deposition of α-synuclein aggregates throughout the Parkinson’s disease brain.

1043778,Crustacea: Decapoda. Caridea,2004,Daisy Wowor and Yixiong Cai and Peter KL Ng,,Freshwater Invertebrates of the Malaysian Region. Malaysian Academy of Sciences,,337-357,,GENERAL BIOLOGY The habitats in which the various groups of prawns live are very diverse. Only in the highest mountains which have almost vertical waterfalls have the prawns not made their way there. denied access by the sheer impassibility of the terrain. In all other kinds of waterfalls. even if the water is strongly riparian. prawns have found niches. Even in extreme habitats like peat swamps. where waters can reach pH 3.3. and stagnant pools where daytime temperatures may reach 35ºC. some species of prawns have found a home. Most freshwater prawns are scavengers or detrital (detritus) feeders (see families). and no species actively hunts prey. As such. they are very important in ecosystems in recycling organic material. Many prawn species tend to have restricted distributions in pristine habitats and are very vulnerable to human disturbance and development.

A major source of erroneous Rieske protein trees lies in the presence of a large. poorly conserved domain prone to accommodate very long insertions in well-defined structural hot spots substantially hampering multiple alignments. The remaining smaller domain. in contrast. is too conserved to allow distant phylogenies to be deduced with sufficient confidence.

Three studies were conducted to assess toxicity of these chemicals towards reproduction of freshwater fish. It was shown that heavy metals added to the diets accumulate in brain tissue of carp. and this accumulation results in inhibition of the secretion of noradrenaline and stimulation of the secretion of dopamine in the hypothalamus. These processes results in a disturbance of hormonal equilibrium of the hypothalamo-pituitary system. which can unfavorably influence the efficiency of artificial spawning in fish. Quality of salmonid and sturgeon sperm was impaired after in vitro exposure to heavy metals. The degree of this toxic effect was species-specific. It was demonstrated that sperm motility parameters appeared to be good indicators of adverse effects of heavy metals fish sperm. The protection role of seminal plasma against toxic effects of heavy metals was suggested for salmonid fish. Oral application of 4-nonylphenol (NP) disrupted reproduction in pikeperch. In juvenile fish a decrease in the percentage of males and an increase of intersex fish was observed in relation to dose of NP and time of exposure to this alkylphenol.

Major rDNA sites as revealed by sequential CMA3/Ag staining and confirmed by in situ hybridization with a 18S rDNA probe were situated in two loci and were found to be polymorphic in size and displaying several distinct forms. The 5S rDNA was located by PRINS on three pairs of subtelocentric chromosomes. additional minor signal was present at the centromere of one metacentric element. 5S sites were not associated with NORs. The dosage compensation mechanism was proposed as an explanation of high frequency of lethal rDNA-deleted forms of the NOR-bearing chromosomes.

A recent article in Journal of Clinical Oncology2 addressed exactly this question and concluded that two new markers in combination with serum ß2-microglobulin (Sß2M) gave a more powerful prognostic index than the IMWG markers.Using a molecular karyotyping method to identify copy-number abnormalities in 192 patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma. the authors identified two regions associated with a poor prognosis. deletion of 12p13. 31 [del (12p13. 31)] and amplification of 1q23. 3 [amp (1q23. 3)]. and one region associated with a good prognosis. amplification of 5q31. 3 [amp (5q31. 3)].

We use Xenopus egg extracts to recapitulate DPC repair in vitro and show that this process is coupled to DNA replication. A DPC on the leading strand template arrests the replisome by stalling the CMG helicase. The DPC is then degraded on DNA. yielding a peptide-DNA adduct that is bypassed by CMG. The leading strand subsequently resumes synthesis. stalls again at the adduct. and then progresses past the adduct using DNA polymerase ζ. A DPC on the lagging strand template only transiently stalls the replisome. but it too is degraded. allowing Okazaki fragment bypass.

It has been known for many years that FA patient-derived cells are exquisitely sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin C. On this basis. it was widely assumed that failure to repair endogenous interstrand cross-links (ICLs) causes FA. although the endogenous mutagen that generates these lesions remained elusive. Recent genetic evidence now suggests that endogenous aldehydes are the driving force behind FA. Importantly. aldehydes cause a variety of DNA lesions. including ICLs and DNA protein cross-links (DPCs). re-kindling the debate about which DNA lesions cause FA.

Single-molecule imaging reveals that GINS does not dissociate from CMG during bypass and that CMG slows dramatically after bypass. likely due to uncoupling from the stalled leading strand.

Using Xenopus egg extracts that recapitulate replication-coupled DPC proteolysis. we show that DPCs can be degraded by SPRTN or the proteasome. which act as independent DPC proteases. Proteasome recruitment requires DPC polyubiquitylation. which is partially dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAIP. In contrast.

Padilla-Noriega and L. and Paniagua and O. and Guzmán-León,298,Virology,,1-7,,A recombinant vaccinia virus encoding rotavirus protein NSP3 driven by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from the encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus was able to abate protein synthesis in BSC1 cells by 25-fold. with as much as 30% of the remaining protein synthesis being NSP3. Hence NSP3 shuts off host cell protein synthesis down to the level seen during rotavirus infection but is unable to prevent translation from EMC IRES-driven genes. This effect was abolished by deletions in the eIF4G-binding (aa 274–313) and the dimerization (aa 150–206) but not the viral mRNA-binding (aa 83–149) domains. supporting that NSP3 functions in vivo as a dimer.

Oswaldo Cruz,,603-611,,Rotavirus replication and virus assembly take place in electrodense spherical structures known as viroplasms whose main components are the viral proteins NSP2 and NSP5. The viroplasms are produced since early times after infection and seem to grow by stepwise addition of viral proteins and by fusion. however. the mechanism of viropIasms formation is unknown. In this study we found that the viroplasms surface colocalized with microtubules. and seem to be caged by a microtubule network. Moreover inhibition of microtubule assembly with nocodazole interfered with viroplasms growth in rotavirus infected cells. We searched for a physical link between viroplasms and microtubules by co-immunoprecipitation assays. and we found that the proteins NSP2 and NSP5 were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-tubulin in rotavirus infected cells and also when they were transiently co-expressed or individually expressed. These results indicate that a functional microtubule network is needed for viroplasm growth presumably due to the association of viroplasms with microtubules via NSP2 and NSP5.,True,I9nrOGcAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,35,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0074-02762006000600006&script=sci_arttext,15218066061954488174,/scholar?cites=15218066061954488174,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0074-02762006000600006&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of RA on the phenotype of corneal stromal keratocytes maintained in vitro for extended periods under serum-free conditions.Methods.: Keratocytes isolated from human corneas were cultured up to 21 days in serum-free media supplemented with RA or DMSO vehicle. The effects of RA and of its removal after treatment on cell proliferation and morphology were evaluated. In addition. the expression of keratocyte markers was quantified at the transcriptional and protein levels by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting or ELISA. respectively. Furthermore. the effects of RA on keratocyte migration were tested using scratch assays.Results.: Keratocytes cultured with RA up to 10× 10− 6 M showed enhanced proliferation and stratification. and reduced mobility. RA also promoted the expression of keratocyte-characteristic proteoglycans. such as keratocan. lumican. and decorin. and increased the amounts of collagen type-I in culture while significantly reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteases 1. 3. and 9. RA effects were reversible. and cell phenotype reverted to that of control after removal of RA from media.Conclusions.: Retinoic acid was shown to control the phenotype of human corneal keratocytes cultured in vitro by regulating cell behavior and extracellular matrix composition.

This instrument integrates a single-stage virtually imaged phased array spectrometer with a novel adaptive-optics interferometric filter to achieve unprecedented rejection of the elastic background signal. As a result. highly-resolved. reproducible data from both thin and thick collagen-based materials were obtained. In particular. this technique is capable of rigorously measuring the relative stiffness of different areas of human corneas. thus providing a true non-contact method to characterise the fundamental mechanical features of both live and fixed biological tissue samples.,True,2UXKXD0AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,42,https://pubs.rsc.org/doi/c5fd00152h,9225041216295806688,/scholar?cites=9225041216295806688,,https://pubs.rsc.org/am/content/articlepdf/2016/fd/c5fd00152h,0,0,0

It is a type I membrane glycoprotein. The L1 ectodomain. composed of six Ig-like and five fibronectin (Fn) type-III domains. is involved in homophilic binding. Here. co-immunoprecipitation studies between recombinant truncated forms of human L1 expressed and purified from insect Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells. and endogenous full-length L1 from human NT2N neurons. showed that the L1 ectodomain (L1/ECD) and L1/Ig1–4 interacted homophilically in trans. contrary to mutants L1/Ig1–3 and L1/Ig2-Fn5.

Here we propose that stem cells can be regulated solely through in situ modulation of tissue biomechanics. By first establishing. via high-resolution Brillouin spectro-microscopy. that the outer edge (limbus) of live human corneas has a substantially lower bulk modulus compared to their centre. we then demonstrate that this difference is associated with limbal epithelial stem cell (LESC) residence and YAP-dependent mechanotransduction. This phenotype-through-biomechanics correlation is further explored in vivo using a rabbit alkali burn model. Specifically. we show that treating the burnt surface of the cornea with collagenase effectively restores the tissue’s mechanical properties and its capacity to support LESCs through mechanisms involving YAP …,True,2UXKXD0AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,38,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09331-6,12865560901741078857,/scholar?cites=12865560901741078857,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09331-6,0,0,0

Inc.,The need to source live human tissues for research and clinical applications has been a major driving force for the development of new biomaterials. Ideally. these should elicit the formation of scaffold-free tissues with native-like structure and composition. In this study. we describe a biologically interactive coating that combines the fabrication and subsequent self-release of live purposeful tissues using template–cell–environment feedback. This smart coating was formed from a self-assembling peptide amphiphile comprising a protease-cleavable sequence contiguous with a cell attachment and signaling motif.

In this study. a novel approach to utilise Fmoc-linked peptide amphiphiles comprising the bio-functional cell-adhesion RGDS motif within biomimetic collagen gels was developed. The composite scaffolds thus created were shown to maintain the mechanical properties of the collagen gel while presenting additional bio-activity. In particular. these materials enhanced the adhesion and proliferation of viable human corneal stromal fibroblasts by 300% compared to non-functionalised gels.

We utilized diabodies (DA) as surrogate ligands in a prototypical dimeric receptor-ligand system. the cytokine Erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EpoR). to dimerize EpoR ectodomains in non-native architectures. Diabody-induced signaling amplitudes varied from full to minimal agonism. and structures of these DA/EpoR complexes differed in EpoR dimer orientation and proximity. Diabodies also elicited biased or differential activation of signaling pathways and gene expression profiles compared to EPO.

Mechanistically. MTDH supports the survival of mammary epithelial cells under oncogenic/stress conditions by interacting with and stabilizing Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing 1 (SND1).

The crystal structure of PP2A bound to PP2A phosphatase activator (PTPA) and ATPγS reveals that PTPA makes broad contacts with the structural elements surrounding the PP2A active site and the adenine moiety of ATP. PTPA-binding stabilizes the protein fold of apo-PP2A required for activation. and orients ATP phosphoryl groups to bind directly to the PP2A active site. This allows ATP to modulate the metal-binding preferences of the PP2A active site and utilize the PP2A active site for ATP hydrolysis. In vitro.

1043871,Centralspindlin assembly and 2 phosphorylations on MgcRacGAP by Polo-like kinase 1 initiate Ect2 binding in early cytokinesis,2014,Hyunjung Kim and Feng Guo and Sarang Brahma and Yongna Xing and Mark E Burkard,13,Cell Cycle,18,2952-2961,Taylor & Francis,Cytokinesis is the final step of cell division which partitions genetic and cytosolic content into daughter cells. Failed cytokinesis causes polyploidy. genetic instability. and cancer. Kinases use phosphorylation to regulate the timing and location of the cytokinetic furrow. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential mitotic kinase that triggers cytokinesis by phosphorylating MgcRacGAP to create a docking site for Ect2 at the central spindle. Ect2 binds to MgcRacGAP via its N-terminal BRCT domain (BRCA1 C-terminal). which docks at specific phosphorylated residues.

We further show that cellular transformation. and thus initiation of liver tumorigenesis. were impaired in mice harboring a MYC mutant unable to associate with the corepressor protein MIZ1 (ZBTB17). Notably. switching off the oncogene in advanced carcinomas revealed that MYC was required for the continuous activation …,True,H3bTaxwAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC,40,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/76/12/3463.short,12729283392824257225,/scholar?cites=12729283392824257225,,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/76/12/3463.full.pdf,0,0,0

However. managing and analyzing these data poses new challenges. which may easily be underestimated by research groups devoid of IT and quantitative skills. In this perspective. we identify five issues that should be carefully addressed by research groups approaching NGS technologies. In particular. the five key issues to be considered concern: 1) adopting a laboratory management system (LIMS) and safeguard the resulting raw data structure in downstream analyses; 2) monitoring the flow of the data and standardizing input and output directories and file names. even when multiple analysis protocols are used on the same data; 3) ensuring complete traceability of the analysis performed; 4) enabling non-experienced users to run analyses through a graphical user interface (GUI) acting as a front-end for the pipelines; 5) relying on standard metadata to annotate the datasets. and when possible using controlled vocabularies. ideally derived from biomedical ontologies. Finally. we discuss the currently available tools in the light of these issues. and we introduce HTS-flow. a new workflow management system (WMS) conceived to address the concerns we raised.

Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) generated from enhancers have been proposed as a general facet of enhancer function and some have been shown to be required for enhancer activity. Here we examine the transcription-factor-(TF)-dependence of ncRNA expression to define enhancers and enhancer-associated ncRNAs that are involved in a TF-dependent regulatory network. TBX5. a cardiac TF. regulates a network of cardiac channel genes to maintain cardiac rhythm. We deep sequenced wildtype and Tbx5-mutant mouse atria. identifying ~2600 novel Tbx5-dependent ncRNAs. Tbx5-dependent ncRNAs were enriched for tissue-specific marks of active enhancers genome-wide. Tbx5-dependent ncRNAs emanated from regions that are enriched for TBX5-binding and that demonstrated Tbx5-dependent enhancer activity. Tbx5-dependent ncRNA transcription provided a quantitative metric of Tbx5-dependent enhancer activity. correlating with target gene expression. We identified RACER. a novel Tbx5-dependent long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) required for the expression of the calcium-handling gene Ryr2.

A number of processes are involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. especially within the tumor microenvironment. Angiogenesis represents a hallmark phenomenon in cancer. and it is responsible for tumor spread and metastasis in ovarian cancer. among other tumor types. as it leads to new blood vessel formation. In recent years angiogenesis has been given considerable attention in order to identify targets for developing effective anti-tumor therapies. Growth factors have been identified to play key roles in driving angiogenesis and. thus. the formation of new blood vessels that assist in “feeding” cancer. Such molecules include the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). the fibroblast growth factor (FGF). and the angiopoietin/Tie2 receptor complex. These proteins are key players in complex molecular pathways within the tumor cell and they have been in the spotlight of the development of anti-angiogenic molecules that may act as stand-alone therapeutics. or in concert with standard treatment regimes such as chemotherapy. The pathways involved in angiogenesis and molecules that have been developed in order to combat angiogenesis are described in this paper.

We tested the hypothesis that the historic introduction and spread of the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) into the eastern US was followed by Plethodon population declines. We expected to detect elevated prevalence of Bd prior to population declines as observed for Central American plethodontids. We tested 1.498 Plethodon salamanders of 12 species (892 museum specimens. 606 wild individuals) for the presence of Bd. and tested 94 of those for Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bs) and for ranavirus. Field samples were collected in 2011 from 48 field sites across a 767 km transect. Historic samples from museum specimens were collected at five sites with the greatest number and longest duration of collection (1957–987). four of which were sampled in the field in 2011. None of the museum specimens were positive for Bd. but four P. cinereus from field surveys were positive. The overall Bd prevalence from 1957–2011 for 12 Plethodon species sampled across a 757 km transect was 0.2% (95% CI 0.1–0.7%). All 94 samples were negative for Bs and ranavirus.

Stomate-penetrating fungi. typified by the bean rust [Uromyces appendiculatus] and the wheat stem rust [Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici] fungi. also respond to surface topography of plant leaves. The rusts. especially. have a well-developed ability to respond to surface morphology to position and anchor their infection structures over the stomatal opening. The evidence available suggests that rust germlings have a remarkable contact-sensitive mechanism that can recognize the junctions between epidermal cells to orient germ tube growth. yet independently recognize the stomatal guard cell to start development of the infection structures.

The dark pigmentation was in the bacteroid zone. was not correlated with nodule effectiveness. and was additional to the leghemoglobin pigment. Only rhizobial strains with a nongummy (“dry”) colony morphology produced dark nodules. Visually distinguishable pink and dark nodules formed on the same root when a mixture of pink and dark strains was applied as inoculum. The dark-nodule phenotype was therefore appraised as a marker and found to be useful for studying nodulation competition with strains of the orthodox pink-nodule type.

1043940,Intestinal microbiota of broiler chickens as affected by litter management regimens,2016,Lingling Wang and Mike Lilburn and Zhongtang Yu,7,Frontiers in microbiology,,593,Frontiers,Poultry litter is a mixture of bedding materials and enteric bacteria excreted by chickens. and it is typically reused for multiple growth cycles in commercial broiler production. Thus. bacteria can be transmitted from one growth cycle to the next via litter. However. it remains poorly understood how litter reuse affects development and composition of chicken gut microbiota. In this study. the effect of litter reuse on the microbiota in litter and in chicken gut was investigated using 2 litter management regimens: fresh vs. reused litter. Samples of ileal mucosa and cecal digesta were collected from young chicks (10 days of age) and mature birds (35 days of age). Based on analysis using DGGE and pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons. the microbiota of both the ileal mucosa and the cecal contents was affected by both litter management regimen and age of birds. Faecalibacterium. Oscillospira. Butyricicoccus. and one unclassified candidate genus closely related to Ruminococcus were most predominant in the cecal samples. while Lactobacillus was predominant in the ileal samples at both ages and in the cecal samples collected at day 10. At days 10 and 35. 8 and 3 genera. respectively. in the cecal luminal microbiota differed significantly in relative abundance between the 2 litter management regimens. Compared to the fresh litter. reused litter increased predominance of halotolerant/alkaliphilic bacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. a butyrate-producing gut bacterium.

Genomic studies have revealed 30 members of this family in Arabidopsis and 31 in rice. falling into five clades. Newly discovered functions involve responses to salt and pathogen stresses. the development of perianth organs. trichomes. stomata and the seed abscission layer. and the regulation of late embryogenesis.

As one of 30 trihelix proteins in Arabidopsis. it falls in the GT2 clade with duplicated trihelix DNA‐binding domains and a long α–helical central domain. PTL orthologs occur in all angiosperm genomes examined except grasses. and sequence comparisons reveal that there are two further short conserved domains at each end. GT2 itself carries two nuclear localization sequences. but PTL has an additional nuclear localization sequence (NLS). We show that PTL can act as a transcriptional activator in yeast and in planta. with the latter tested by two different functional assays.

Because this ability is genetic information that is ‘hard-wired’ into the genome. it is called ‘innate immunity’ and it draws its origins from a phylogenetically ancient form of immunity common to plants and animals.

Substantial intraspecific variation in SLA is common and usually correlates with environmental conditions. For instance. SLA decreases with increasing altitude. which is understood as adjustment to temperature. It is generally assumed that intraspecific variation is mostly the result of environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity. but genetic effects may also be present. due to local adaptation or genetic drift. In this study. genotypic and environmental effects on SLA were experimentally separated for the widespread Alpine bell flower Campanula thyrsoides by transplanting plants to three common gardens at contrasting altitudes (600. 1.235 and 1.850 m a.s.l.).

We addressed the following questions: are there genetic differentiations in phenology between populations from low and high elevations. and are populations from the upper elevational limit of a species’ distribution able to respond to increasing temperature to the same extent as low-elevation …,True,J7Y9aoAAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,105,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00442-012-2580-9.pdf,1746735478775327674,/scholar?cites=1746735478775327674,,https://doc.rero.ch/record/316044/files/442_2012_Article_2580.pdf,0,0,0

These fjords share a common mouth to the open sea. and both are influenced by the input of sediment-rich glacial meltwater leading to decreased surface salinity. increased turbidity and decreased light penetration during summer. Earlier classical taxonomic studies had described the pelagic protistan composition of the Kongsfjorden during summer. revealing the dominance of flagellates of often unresolved taxonomic origin. Only little information existed on microbial eukaryote composition of the Krossfjorden as well as the bacterial composition of both fjords. The aim of the present study was to analyze and compare surface summertime protistan and bacterial communities in both fjords. using molecular approaches (16S and 18S rRNA DGGE. sequencing).

H3K27 is also present in mono- and dimethylated states; however. the functional roles of H3K27me1 and H3K27me2 deposition remain poorly characterized.

The Ndc80 complex is evolutionarily conserved and contains the four subunits Spc24. Spc25. Nuf2. and Ndc80 (whose human homologue is called Hec1). All four subunits are predicted to contain globular domains and extensive coiled coil regions. To gain an insight into the organization of the human Ndc80 complex. we reconstituted it using recombinant methods. The hydrodynamic properties of the recombinant Ndc80 complex are identical to those of the endogenous HeLa cell complex and are consistent with a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry of the four subunits and a very elongated shape.

It has been postulated that one of the main oncogenic properties of the HOXA9 transcription factor is its ability to control the expression of the p16/p19 tumor suppressor locus (Cdkn2a). thereby compensating Polycomb-mediated repression. which is dispensable for leukemias induced by Hox-activating fusions.

1044029,Channel simulation in quantum metrology,2018,Riccardo Laurenza and Cosmo Lupo and Gaetana Spedalieri and Samuel L Braunstein and Stefano Pirandola,5,Quantum Measurements and Quantum Metrology,1,1-12,De Gruyter Open,In this review we discuss how channel simulation can be used to simplify the most general protocols of quantum parameter estimation. where unlimited entanglement and adaptive joint operations may be employed. Whenever the unknown parameter encoded in a quantum channel is completely transferred in an environmental program state simulating the channel. the optimal adaptive estimation cannot beat the standard quantum limit. In this setting. we elucidate the crucial role of quantum teleportation as a primitive operation which allows one to completely reduce adaptive protocols over suitable teleportation-covariant channels and derive matching upper and lower bounds for parameter estimation. For these channels. we may express the quantum Cramér Rao bound directly in terms of their Choi matrices. Our review considers both discrete-and continuous-variable systems. also presenting some new results for …,True,I3tazE0AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,30,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/qmetro-2018-0001/html,17251619682127121025,/scholar?cites=17251619682127121025,,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/qmetro-2018-0001/pdf,0,0,0

1044030,Quantum reading under a local energy constraint,2012,Gaetana Spedalieri and Cosmo Lupo and Stefano Mancini and Samuel L Braunstein and Stefano Pirandola,86,Physical Review A,1,012315,American Physical Society,Nonclassical states of light play a central role in many quantum information protocols. Very recently. their quantum features have been exploited to improve the readout of information from digital memories. modeled as arrays of microscopic beam splitters [Pirandola. Phys. Rev. Lett. 106. 090504 (2011)]. In this model of “quantum reading.” a nonclassical source of light with Einstein-Podolski-Rosen correlations has been proven to retrieve more information than any classical source. In particular. the quantum-classical comparison has been performed under a global energy constraint. ie. by fixing the mean total number of photons irradiated over each memory cell. In this paper we provide an alternative analysis which is based on a local energy constraint. meaning that we fix the mean number of photons per signal mode irradiated over the memory cell. Under this assumption. we investigate the critical number of signal …,True,I3tazE0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,29,https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.012315,12348402116344270946,/scholar?cites=12348402116344270946,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.3448,0,0,0
