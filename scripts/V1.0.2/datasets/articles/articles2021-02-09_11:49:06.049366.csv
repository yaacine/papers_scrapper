100301,Cloning and expression of a rat brain GABA transporter,1990,John Guastella and Nathan Nelson and Hannah Nelson and Linda Czyzyk and Shoshi Keynan and May C Miedel and Norman Davidson and Henry A Lester and Baruch I Kanner,249,Science,4974,1303-1306,American Association for the Advancement of Science,A complementary DNA clone (designated GAT-1) encoding a transporter for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been isolated from rat brain. and its functional properties have been examined in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes injected with GAT-1 synthetic messenger RNA accumulated [3H]GABA to levels above control values. The transporter encoded by GAT-1 has a high affinity for GABA. is sodium-and chloride-dependent. and is pharmacologically similar to neuronal GABA transporters. The GAT-1 protein shares antigenic determinants with a native rat brain GABA transporter. The nucleotide sequence of GAT-1 predicts a protein of 599 amino acids with a molecular weight of 67 kilodaltons. Hydropathy analysis of the deduced protein suggests multiple transmembrane regions. a feature shared by several cloned transporters; however. database searches indicate that GAT-1 is not homologous …,True,yNrdRDIAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,940,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/249/4974/1303.abstract,1293429041449177352,/scholar?cites=1293429041449177352,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47175444/Cloning_and_expression_of_a_rat_brain_GA20160711-21818-16jq5ij.pdf,0,0,0

The phenotype of the mutant is caused by a single amino acid change (Gly149 to Arg) in the essential yeast gene CDC1. The mutant could be suppressed by overexpression of the SMF1 gene. which was isolated as an extragenic high-copy suppressor. The SMF1 gene codes for a highly hydrophobic protein and its deletion renders the yeast cells sensitive to low manganese concentration. In accordance with this observation. the smf1 null mutant exhibits reduced Mn2+ uptake at micromolar concentrations. Using a specific antibody. we demonstrated that Smf1p is located in the yeast plasma membrane. These results suggest that Smf1p is involved in high-affinity Mn2+ uptake.

NRAMP1 functions in metal transport across the phagosomal membrane of macrophages. and defective NRAMP1 causes sensitivity to several intracellular pathogens. DCT1 (NRAMP2) transport metal ions at the plasma membrane of cells of both the duodenum and in peripheral tissues. and defective DCT1 cause anemia. The driving force for the metal-ion transport is proton gradient (protonmotive force). In DCT1 the stoichiometry between metal ion and proton varied at different conditions due to a mechanistic proton slip. Though the metal ion transport by Smf1p. the yeast homolog of DCT1. is also a protonmotive force. a slippage of sodium ions was observed.

The enzymes directly involved in generating and harnessing the energy of proton gradients (H+-ATPases). are found in nearly all cells and presumably appeared very early in cell evolution 2. It has been suggested that they originally functioned as a pH-stat mechanism. disposing of the excess protons generated by fermentative metabolism 3'4.

The resulting mutants did not grow in medium with a pH value higher than 6.5 and grew well only within a narrow pH range around 5.5.

Ferredoxin inhibits the transfer of electrons from NADPH to ferricyanide (diaphorase activity) to NAD (transhydrogenase) and the photoreduction of pyridine nucleotides during the Hill reaction. On the basis of the kinetics of inhibition. it is suggested that the flavoprotein has two binding sites for substrates. At one site the enzyme binds NADPH and at the other site NADP or NAD. Ferredoxin inhibits the flavoprotein by competing with the binding of substrates at both sites.At proper ferredoxin concentrations.

The malvolio gene encodes a protein (MVL) that exhibits homology to the mammalian natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins. It is also homologous to the Smf1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. which we have recently demonstrated to function as a Mn2+/Zn2+ transporter. We proposed that the Drosophila and mammalian proteins. like the yeast SMF1 gene product. are metal-ion transporters. To test this hypothesis. malvolio mutant flies were allowed to develop. from egg to adulthood. on a medium containing elevated concentrations of metal ions. Mutant flies that were reared in the presence of 10 mmol l-1 MnCl2 or FeCl2 developed into adults with recovered taste behavior. CaCl2 or MgCl2 had no effect on the mutant9s taste perception.

100399,Photosystems and global effects of oxygenic photosynthesis,2011,Nathan Nelson,1807,,8,856-863,Elsevier,Because life on earth is governed by the second law of thermodynamics. it is subject to increasing entropy. Oxygenic photosynthesis. the earth's major producer of both oxygen and organic matter. is a principal player in the development and maintenance of life. and thus results in increased order. The primary steps of oxygenic photosynthesis are driven by four multi-subunit membrane protein complexes: photosystem I. photosystem II. cytochrome b6f complex. and F-ATPase. Photosystem II generates the most positive redox potential found in nature and thus capable of extracting electrons from water. Photosystem I generates the most negative redox potential found in nature; thus. it largely determines the global amount of enthalpy in living systems.

Under the same conditions the amount of protons taken up by the chloroplast is markedly (up to 20-fold) increased. The postillumination formation of ATP (XE) is also markedly increased. Concentrations of pyridine which stimulate appreciably the extent of the pH increase. inhibit only slightly the formation of ATP in the conventional one-step assay. Pyridine causes a large light-dependent absorbancy decrease. The effects of pyridine can be accounted for by assuming that it diffuses into the chloroplast as the uncharged moiety and binds protons inside the chloroplast thylakoids. This action increases the “buffer capacity” of the chloroplast and causes an increase in pH and XE. The effects of pyridine differ significantly from those of other amines presumably because of the low pKa of the …,True,yNrdRDIAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,64,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000398617190035X,1908451513218719486,/scholar?cites=1908451513218719486,,,0,0,0

Dordrecht,For many years studies on the mechanism of light-activated reactions in plants have been conducted mainly by physicists and biophysicists. The biochemists were told that the production of bioenergy by light is very different from anything that has been encountered in animal cells. This is undoubtedly still true for the primary reaction in photosynthesis involving light and chlorophyll. However. it is becoming evident that the function of this reaction is to provide electrons for the reduction of the electron transfer carriers of the chloroplasts. The basic mechanism of the electron flow and the phosphorylation coupled to this process seems in principle the same as that catalyzed by the mitochondrial membrane in oxidative phosphorylation.

The stoichiometry of the proton to metal ion is variable. and under optimal transport conditions. more than 10 protons are co-transported with a single metal ion. To understand this phenomenon better. we used site-directed mutagenesis of DCT1 and analyzed the mutants by complementation of yeast suppressor of mitochondria import function-null mutants and electrophysiology with Xenopus oocytes.

Among the more important chemical features of water is its dissociation into protons and hydroxyl ions. The presence of relatively high proton concentrations in the ambient solution resulted in the evolution of proton pumps during the dawn of life on earth. These proton pumps maintained neutral pH inside the cells and generated electrochemical gradients of protons (proton-motive force) across their membranes. The existence of proton-motive force enabled the evolution of porters driven by it that are most probably among the more primitive porters in the world. The directionality of the substrate transport by the porters could be to both sides of the membranes because they can serve as proton symporters or antiporters.

Using elastic network modeling to investigate the ring's eigen-modes. we found five dominant modes of motion that fell into three classes. They revealed the following deformations of the ring: (I) ellipsoidal. (II) opposite twisting of the luminal circular surface of the ring against the stromal surface. and (III) kinking of the hairpin-shaped monomers in the middle. resulting in bending/stretching of the ring. Extension of the elastic network analysis to rings of different cn-symmetry revealed the same classes of dominant modes as in P. sativum (c14). We suggest the following functional roles for these classes: The first and third classes of modes affect the interaction of the c-ring with its counterparts in FO. namely subunits a and bb'. These modes are likely to be involved in ion-translocation and torque generation. The second class of deformation. along with deformations of subunits γ and ε might serve to elastically buffer the torque transmission between FO and F1.,True,yNrdRDIAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C,32,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043045,3084542084119373436,/scholar?cites=3084542084119373436,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043045,0,0,0

A continuous process of catecholamine uptake takes place in chromaffin granules of adrenal medullae cells. The driving force for this uptake is a proton-motive force generated by ATP hydrolysis. which is catalyzed by an ATPase located in the granule membrane. Though ATPase activity of chromaffin granule membranes was discovered over two decades ago. until recently. the identity of the enzyme responsible for the formation of proton-motive force was not clear. The revelation of the true identity of the chromaffin granule proton-ATPase was hampered by contamination of mitochondrial membranes in the granule membrane preparation and the instability of the genuine enzyme.

The N-type assignment in frog is based principally on pharmacological sensitivity to ω-conotoxin GVIA. Our studies show that zebrafish neuromuscular transmission is also sensitive to ω-conotoxin GVIA. However. positional cloning of a mutant line with compromised neuromuscular function identified a mutation in a P/Q- rather than N-type channel. Cloning and heterologous expression of this P/Q-type channel confirmed a block by ω-conotoxin GVIA raising the likelihood that all vertebrates. including frog. use the P/Q-type calcium channel for neuromuscular transmission.

Since the solute composition in the various spaces has to be different. all the biological membranes function in energy conduction.

Most of these properties are designated by multisubunit protein complexes. Lipid bilayers are largely impermeable to most solutes. including small ions and polar molecules (Danielli and Davson. 1935; Singer. 1974).

The presence of Mg2+ was found to be obligatory for this protection. ADP and GTP also protected the enzyme against salt inactivation but to a much smaller extent.

The four GABA transporters exhibit unique presteady-state currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The properties of the presteady-state currents correspond to their different affinities to Na+. In the presence of 20 μM GABA and at pH 7.5. the half-maximal uptake activity was 47. 120. 25 and 35 mM Na+ for GAT1. GAT2. GAT3 and GAT4. respectively. The appearance of presteady-state currents at positive or negative imposed potentials was in correlation with the affinity to Na+.

In order to get biologically relevant information the physical properties of the model membrane should be as close as possible to those of biological membranes] 1. 21.The physical properties of phospholipid vesicles and planar lipid bilayers are close to those of biological membranes. Phospholipid vesicles are too small to permit direct electrical measurements across their membrane; planar lipid membranes. which allow electrical measurements. are usually too fragile and difficult to handle. To overcome this drawback phospholipid-impregnated Millipore filters were introduced [3-51. It was claimed that the physical properties of these model membranes are close enough to those of biological membranes to allow conclusions about reconstitution of isolated peptides into them [S]. Here we show that the capacitance of phospholipid-impregnated Millipore filters is too low. indicating that these membranes are too thick. to allow the incorporation and study of membrane channels.

It contains an ATPase section that can readily be solubilized and a membrane section that functions in energy transduction. The key role of the membrane sector is to conduct protons across the membrane under specific conditions that will bring about the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP on the level of the ATPase enzyme (l). It was suggested that the protons are conducted across the membrane via a specific channel composed of a proteolipid molecule (2). A purified proteolipid in a state allowing reconstitution of a native proton channel was widely sought for in various organelles that are active in phosphorylation.

In order to understand this challenge he may first try to reconstruct the evolution of the process taking into account the main driving forces that were assumed to exist during the last 3. 5 billion years on earth. Now we know that the electrochemical gradient of protons is the universal high-energy intermediate produced and uti lized by every living cell in nature. This high energy intermediate is an expression of different concentrations of active protons in the two faces of biological membranes. Why then did nature elect to utilize a pre dominantly electrochemical gradient of protons and no other ion? The answer to this question may lie in the environment in which the first living creatures evolved. Some of them may have been challenged by an acidic environment that lowered their internal pH (by a proton leak through their membranes) to lethal levels. To counteract these inci dents proton pumps evolved. Two independent systems were devel oped. One was a proton pump coupled to energetically downhill vectorial electron transport across membranes and the second was an ATP-dependent proton pump. Both of them pump protons outward from the cells generating an electrochemical gradient of protons.,True,yNrdRDIAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC,11,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=OtnqCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP9&dq=info:20jAezRrS1cJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Gupiok8lMv&sig=-lvfRB0UF6XgPTfHgDqlCq0u5fY,6290239177711700187,/scholar?cites=6290239177711700187,,,0,0,0

However. these essential nutrients. are toxic at elevated levels. Therefore metal ion transporters play a crucial role in maintaining the vital metal-ions' homeostasis. The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) metal transporters SMFgens and their homologues in other organisms (NRAMP-related transporters) play a central role in the accumulation of metal ions in different tissues and distinct cellular organelles. The use of yeast as an eukaryotic model system facilitated the study of these metal ion transporters and served also as a heterologous expression system through complementation of various yeast null mutants with related genes.

Potentiation of this signaling with allosteric modulators such as anesthetics. barbiturates. and neurosteroids can lead to respiratory arrest. Paradoxically. pregnant animals continue to breathe normally despite nearly 100-fold increases in circulating neurosteroids. ε subunit-containing GABAARs are insensitive to positive allosteric modulation. thus we hypothesized that pregnant rats increase ε subunit-containing GABAAR expression on brainstem neurons of the ventral respiratory column (VRC). In vivo. pregnancy rendered respiratory motor output insensitive to otherwise lethal doses of pentobarbital. a barbiturate previously used to categorize the ε subunit. Using electrode array recordings in vitro. we demonstrated that putative respiratory neurons of the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) were also rendered insensitive to the effects of pentobarbital during pregnancy. but unit activity in the VRC was rapidly inhibited by the GABAAR agonist. muscimol. VRC unit activity from virgin and post-partum females was potently inhibited by both pentobarbital and muscimol. Brainstem ε subunit mRNA and protein levels were increased in pregnant rats. and GABAAR ε subunit expression co-localized with a marker of rhythm generating neurons (neurokinin 1 receptors) in the preBötC. These data support the hypothesis that pregnancy renders respiratory motor output and respiratory neuron activity insensitive to barbiturates. most likely via increased ε subunit-containing GABAAR expression on respiratory rhythm-generating neurons.

Supplementum,,185-194,,The oligomeric state of the proteolipid subunit of V-ATPase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied using hemagglutinine (HA) epitope-tag. Like with several other highly hydrophobic proteins. the proteolipid tends to aggregate in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). We observed that the oligomeric state of the proteolipid predetermined its tendency for aggregation. Recently we discovered a novel V-ATPase subunit. denoted as M16 for the mammalian enzyme and Vma10p for the yeast enzyme. that is homologous to the b subunit of the membrane sector of F-ATPases. It is assumed that the structure of Vma10p resembles that of subunit b which is basically two anti parallel helices. We mutated the VMA10 gene to change charges on the protein in helices and to introduce helix braking instead of helix forming amino acids. The functionality of the mutated VMA10 was analyzed by growing the transformed yeast cells on a YPD medium buffered at pH 7.5. Two inactive site-directed mutants we used for obtaining second-site suppressors. Mutagenesis with EMS was utilized to get an equal chance of obtaining intra and extragene second-site suppressors. To our surprise the number of colonies that grew at pH 7.5 was too large to account for mutations in V-ATPase subunits. Apparently. mutations that are situated in genes that do not encode V-ATPase subunits could reverse the phenotype of V-ATPase null mutations resulting in growth at pH 7.5. The large number of colonies that grew at pH 7.5 after EMS treatment suggest a big complex with multiple subunits as a target for mutagenesis. The observed phenomenon is very intriguing.

The fundamental function of biological membranes is to separate components and to maintain different compositions of solutes in the separate spaces. Therefore. essentially every biological membrane functions in energy transduction. The maintenance of the different compositions in the two sides of the membrane is based on its functional asymmetry. The degree of asymmetry varies from uneven distribution of lipids in the bilayer up to absolute polarity of large protein complexes in the membrane. This asymmetry arises from the vectorial assembly of the individual protein complexes into the membranes in vivo where a high degree of specificity is maintained.

Evolution has apparently led to the utilization of pre-existing bacterial multidrug transporters for monoamine neurotransmission in the vertebrate brain. The environment of unicellular and higher organism is laced with poisonous compounds. some of which are self-produced by their own metabolic pathways. To sustain life. the cells must get rid of these cytotoxic compounds and. in essence. achieve a homeostasis of the poison. The process of waste and poison removal from the cells involves special transporters that recognize the damaging compounds and transport them out of the cell. These transporters are divided into two main families. one utilizing the energy of ATP and the other utilizing the energy of ion gradients (Kanner. 1989; Nelson. 1992). Most transporters of both families have a very broad specificity for substrates and most of them are hydrophobic compounds. but they have no apparent structural similarity. Recent studies on the genes and cDNAs encoding these transporters shed some light on their general structure and function but have revealed no clues to the molecular mechanism mediating substrate recognition and translocation. In contrast to monoamines. the homeostasis of glutamate in the brain is not influenced by the reactivity of glutamate but by the interaction between glutamate and specific receptors on the cell surface. Because glutamate is not a reactive compound. it can be accumulated to quite high concentrations in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 1).

Neurosteroids fluctuate similarly and enhance the actions of GABA. Increased GABAA receptor function could cause excessive inhibition of respiration. It is unclear how respiratory neurons maintain homeostasis during pregnancy. We hypothesized that respiratory control is protected by an upregulation of GABAA receptor ε subunits during pregnancy in the ventral respiratory column (VRC). Insertion of ε subunits into GABAA receptors confers insensitivity to neurosteroids and barbiturates (GABAA receptor agonists). We used (1) in vivo phrenic nerve recording from male. virgin female. pregnant and postpartum rats to assess responses to increasing doses of pentobarbital.

If the extremely effective photosynthetic energy conversion could be efficiently combined with a biological process of hydrogen production. it will represent a significant step toward this goal. The best candidate to do the job is photosystem I (PSI) of oxygenic photosynthesis. Despite its enormous complexity. the plant PSI is arguably the most efficient nano-photochemical machine in Nature. It emerged as a homodimeric structure containing several chlorophyll molecules over 3.5 billion years ago. and has perfected its photoelectric properties ever since. The recently determined structure of plant PSI. which is at the top of the evolutionary tree of this kind of complexes. provided the first relatively high-resolution structural model of the supercomplex containing a reaction center (RC) and a peripheral antenna (LHCI) complexes.

For example. the respiratory control network in pregnant rats becomes relatively insensitive to barbiturates due to increased expression of ε-subunit-containing GABAARs in the ventral respiratory column. We hypothesized that this plasticity may be a compensatory response to a chronic increase in inhibitory tone caused by increased central neurosteroid levels. Thus. we tested whether increased inhibitory tone was sufficient to induce ε-subunit upregulation on respiratory and cortical neurons in adult rats. Chronic intermittent increases in inhibitory tone in male and female rats was induced via daily 5-min exposures to 3% isoflurane. After 7d of treatment. phrenic burst frequency was less sensitive to barbiturate in isoflurane-treated male and female rats in vivo. Neurons in the ventral respiratory group and cortex were less sensitive to pentobarbital in vitro following 7d and 30d of intermittent isoflurane-exposure in both male and female rats. The pentobarbital insensitivity in 7d isoflurane-treated rats was reversible after another 7d.

Neurotransmitters cotransport with sodium utilizing the energy stored in transmembrane electrochemical gradients generated by primary ion pumps. Studies on neurotransmitter uptake indicated the existence of multiple uptake systems. each relatively selective for a specific neurotransmitter. A family of Nat/Cl− neurotransmitter transporters was identified and cDNAs encoding several members of this family were cloned and sequenced (1-8). They can be grouped into four subfamilies of GABA transporters. monoamine transporters. amino acid transporters and “orphan”(NTT4) transporters (9. 10). The transporters of the first three subfamilies show a common structure of twelve transmembrane helices with a single large loop in the external face of the membrane with putative glycosylation sites. An orphan subfamily (NTT4). somewhat remote from the other subfamilies of Nat/Cl−-dependent transporters. was identified from mammalian sources (11. 12). This subfamily of putative neurotransmitter transporters has no known function but is highly expressed in different parts of the brain. Their structure deviates from the others by having two potential glycosylation loops outside the membrane.GABA is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter and it is widely distributed in the mammalian brain. We cloned cDNAs encoding four pharmacologically distinct GABA transporters from mouse brain (13). Homologous cDNAs were cloned from rat brain and other mammalian sources (14. 15).

In addition to NADP production. the electron transfer also results in ATP synthesis. This light-driven process of electron transport and photophosphorylation requires the coordinate function of four thylakoid membrane-protein complexes as well as membrane-associated electron carriers and ligand-binding proteins. The four membrane complexes include photosystem II (PS II). cytochrome bé/f complex. photosystem I (PS I). and an ATP synthase. PS II (Chap—ter 28). which is mainly localized in the appressed regions of thylakoids in chloroplasts of higher plants. oxidizes water and reduces quinones. The electrons from the quinones are transferred across the membrane through the cytochrome bﬁ/f complex (Chapter 4B) which then reduces plastocyanin. PSI. localized predominantly in the nonappressed regions of thylakoids. oxidizes reduced plastocyanin and then transfers the elec-trons to ferredoxin. which is the direct reductant of NADP’"". Photo-chemical activity and the overall reactions of electron transport provide the protonmotive force required for the formation of ATP by the ATP synthase (Chapter 6B). Each complex is composed of several polypep-tide subunits.

100631,Photosystems and global effects of oxygenic photosynthesis Bioenergetics,2011,Nathan Nelson,,,,,,Because life on earth is governed by the second law of thermodynamics. it is subject to increasing entropy. Oxygenic photosynthesis. the earth's major producer of both oxygen and organic matter. is a principal player in the development and maintenance of life. and thus results in increased order. The primary steps of oxygenic photosynthesis are driven by four multi-subunit membrane protein complexes: photosystem I. photosystem II. cytochrome b₆f complex. and F-ATPase. Photosystem II generates the most positive redox potential found in nature and thus capable of extracting electrons from water. Photosystem I generates the most negative redox potential found in nature; thus. it largely determines the global amount of enthalpy in living systems. The recent structural determination of PSII and PSI complexes from cyanobacteria and plants sheds light on the evolutionary forces that shaped oxygenic photosynthesis.

However. the crystal structure is not necessarily identical to the structure of the protein in solution. Here we studied picosecond fluorescence of Photosystem I-Light Harvesting Complex I (PSI-LHCI). a multisubunit pigment-protein complex that catalyzes the first steps of photosynthesis. The ultrafast fluorescence of PSI-LHCI crystals is identical to that of dissolved crystals. but differs considerably from most kinetics presented in literature. In contrast to most studies. the present data can be modeled quantitatively with only 2 compartments: PSI core and LHCI. This yields the rate of charge separation from an equilibrated core (22.5+/-2.5 ps) and rates of excitation energy transfer from LHCI to core (kLC) and vice …,True,yNrdRDIAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC,0,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(08)02923-8.pdf,,,,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(08)02923-8.pdf,0,0,0

It constitutes a reaction center complex (RC) and light‐harvesting complex (LHCI) each composed of quite a few proteins most of which transverse the chloroplast membrane (thylakoid) several times. In addition it contains more than 200 prosthetic groups that is unmatched by any other membrane system. Recently. we have determined the X‐ray crystal structure of PSI from pea plant (Pisum sativum) at 3.4 Å resolution and described a near atomic model of the system. The crystal structure provides a picture at near atomic detail of 11 out of 12 protein subunits of the RC as well as parts of the four subunits of LHCI.

PSI captures sunlight through sophisticated pigment network and uses the energy to perform transmembrane electron transfer. It consists of the core complex. where the charge separation reaction takes place and the light harvesting complex (LHCI). which serves as an additional antenna system. We determined the X-ray crystal structure of the intact PSI from plants at 3.4 Å resolution [1. 2]. The current crystal structure provides a picture at near atomic detail of 17 protein subunits. comprising 45 transmembrane helices. and shows how the biological significance of plant PSI is matched by its structural elements. 3038 amino acids were assigned. as well as 168 chlorophylls. 2 phyloquinones. 3 Fe4S4 clusters and 5 carotenoids.

It possesses Light-Harvesting Complexes (LHCs) that transfer absorbed energy to the core where the excitation energy induces charge separation in the reaction centre (RC). PSI is unique in binding red chlorophylls (Chls). with energy levels lower than that of the RC. These Chls may compete with the RC as an energy sink. The function of these red Chls is not fully known. Many time-resolved optical spectroscopy studies on PSI have revealed very heterogeneous excited state kinetics. Although this at least partly results from the intrinsic properties of PSI . including the presence of the red pigments . it might in principle also be caused by some sample heterogeneity. Here we show that the fluorescence kinetics of (highly homogeneous) crystals of PSI from pea are identical to those of PSI in solution. This justifies the structure-based modelling of spectral properties of PSI . Our new data indicate that the energy flow from LHC to the core proceeds mainly via the red Chls,True,yNrdRDIAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC,0,https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/371907,,,,,0,0,0

We used electrophysiological and tracer uptake methods to examine the effect of valproate on a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (mouse GAT3) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In the absence of GABA. valproate (up to 50 mM) had no noticeable effect on the steady-state electrogenic properties of mGAT3. In the presence of GABA. however. valproate enhanced the GABA-evoked steady-state inward current in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal concentration of 4.6+-0.5 mM. Maximal enhancement of the GABA-evoked current was 275+-10%. Qualitatively similar observations were obtained for human GAT1 and mouse GAT4.

Is an intellectual anyone who has an advanced education and is interested in activities of the mind? Is everyone in the so-called intellectual professions an intellectual? Are our Nobel scientists intellectuals?... A distinction must be made between power of mind and intellectual power; they are not always the same thing.

They are present in every known living cell. and they function in biological energy transduction and pH homeostasis. ATP-dependent proton pumping is performed by two distinct mechanisms. Whereas P-ATPases function by forming phosphoenzyme intermediates. there is no apparent involvement of such intermediates in the activities of F-and V-ATPases. 1. 2 The underlying structures of F-and V-ATPases are similar. and they are composed of distinct catalytic and membrane sectors containing several subunits. Structural studies of V-ATPases isolated from a variety of sources revealed similar subunit structure for all of them. There is general agreement about the presence of some of the subunits and some discrepancies concerning other polypeptides identified in some of the enzymes. Apparently the catalytic sector (V) is composed of 3A. 3B. 1C. ID. and 1E subunits. and the membrane sector (V.) contains 6c (proteolipid).? Ac39. and 1 Ac115 subunits as well as some other proteins not defined as yet. 2-5 Homologous subunits to A.

100681,A family of genes encoding sodium dependent neurotransmitter transporters,1992,N Nelson,21,Neurochemistry International,,W5,Pergamon,Wild type PC12 cells have several sodium-dependent transporters for norepinephrine(NE) and for amino acids exclusive of aspartate; the NE transporter exhibits various forms of regulation. NE transport. but not amino acid uptake is decreased by short treatments with phorbol esters and in a guanethidine-resistant variant. The Wntl oncogene product. which is required for brain development. turns off NE transport but turns on aspartate transport. Using PCR we obtained cDNA clones for the NE and other distinct transporters. Northern blots revealed that these transporter genes are differentially expressed in wild type PC12 and the variants; eg.. there is decreased expression of only the NE transporter gene in the guanethidineresistant and Wntl-expressing variants. Our results suggest that regulation of transporter activity may function physiologically to modulate synaptic transmission.,True,yNrdRDIAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1429293251284307335&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Both preparations were found to be free of chlorophyll b and to have the same spectral properties and chlorophyll/P700 ratio as photosystem I reaction centers isolated from C3 plants. Photosystem I reaction centers from both mesophyll and bundle sheath were found to consist of six subunits with apparent molecular masses of about 70 kDa. 20 kDa. 17 kDa. 16 kDa. 10 kDa and 8 kDa. corresponding to photosystem I reaction center subunits I. 11.

N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding proteolipid (DCCD). The techniques described are suitable for isolating and reconstituting in an active form the proteolipid subunit of chloroplast ATPase. The isolation is initiated by a one-step single-phase l-butanol extraction. The ATPase complex of chloroplasts. mitochondria. and bacterial membranes is composed of two distinct parts: F1. and F0. The identification of F0 is done by the use of DCCD. a reagent that inhibits ATPase activity of the F0-F1 complex. but not that of the F1 alone. DCCD also reduces the proton permeability of the membrane from which F1 is removed. suggesting that the action of the inhibitor is to block a site(s) of the F0 that participates in proton translocation.

It contains an ATPase section that can readily be solubilized and a membrane section that functions in energy transduction. The key role of the membrane sector is to conduct protons across the membrane under specific conditions that will bring about the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP on the level of the ATPase enzyme (1). It was suggested that the protons are conducted across the membrane via a spe-cific channel composed of a proteolipid molecule (2). A puri-fied proteolipid in a state allowing reconstitution of a native proton channel was widely sought for in various organelles that are active in phosphorylation.

Chloroplast Coupling Factor,1977,N NELSON,1,Photosynthesis I: Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photophosphorylation,,393,Springer,The transfer of energy from the initial high energy state. that is produced by electron transport in chloroplasts. involves the activity of coupling factors. Recent studies suggest that an intact vesicular membrane is required for the energy conserv-ing action to proceed (for a comprehensive review. see JAGENDORF. 1975. and this vol. Chap. III. 1). Thus. it might be argued that all membrane components are in essence coupling factors. However. coupling factors are those components which directly play a role in energy transfer from the high energy state to ATP. The elucidation of the mechanism of energy transfer involves various lines of investigation and includes work with isolated chloroplasts and resolved particles as well as purified components and reconstitution experiments. The purification and characterization of the individual components are essential for the study of their mode of action. Among the more powerful approaches for studying energy transfer are resolution and reconstitution experiments. in which various components are removed. thereby inactivating the overall process. and subsequently added back to reactivate the system.Although it seems that there exist coupling factors other than coupling factor 1 (CFı). almost nothing is known about them at the present time. Consequently. this chapter will deal almost exclusively with the properties and mode of action of CFı. The rest of the coupling device will be referred to as the membrane,True,yNrdRDIAAAAJ:HhcuHIWmDEUC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17614466240901132590&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII) are large. multi-subunit. pigment–protein complexes that enable photosynthesis. but this intriguing process remains to be explained fully. Currently. crystal structures of these complexes are available for thermophilic prokaryotic cyanobacteria. The mega-Dalton trimeric PSI complex from thermophilic cyanobacterium. Thermosynechococcus elongatus. was solved at 2.5 Å resolution with X-ray crystallography. That structure revealed the positions of 12 protein subunits (PsaA-F. PsaI-M. and PsaX) and 127 cofactors.Although mesophilic organisms perform most of the world's photosynthesis. no well-resolved trimeric structure of a mesophilic organism exists. Our research model for a mesophilic cyanobacterium was Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. This study aimed to obtain well-resolved crystal structures of [1] a monomeric PSI with all subunits.[2] a trimeric PSI with a reduced number of subunits. and [3] the full. trimeric wild-type PSI complex. We only partially succeeded with the first two structures. but we successfully produced the trimeric PSI structure at 2.5 Å resolution. This structure was comparable to that of the thermophilic species. but we provided more detail. The PSI trimeric supercomplex consisted of 33 protein subunits. 72 carotenoids. 285 chlorophyll a molecules. 51 lipids. 9 iron-sulfur clusters. 6 plastoquinones. 6 putative calcium ions. and over 870 water molecules.

100709,The evolution of photosystem I in light of phage-encoded,,Yuval Mazor and Ilanit Greenberg and Hila Toporik and Oded Beja and Nathan Nelson,,,,,,Recent structural determinations and metagenomic studies shed light on the evolution of photosystem I (PSI) from the homodimeric reaction centre of primitive bacteria to plant PSI at the top of the evolutionary development. The evolutionary scenario of over 3.5 billion years reveals an increase in the complexity of PSI. This phenomenon of ever-increasing complexity is common to all evolutionary processes that in their advanced stages are highly dependent on fine-tuning of regulatory processes. On the other hand. the recently discovered virus-encoded PSI complexes contain a minimal number of subunits. This may reflect the unique selection scenarios associated with viral replication. It may be beneficial for future engineering of productive processes to utilize ‘primitive’complexes that disregard the cellular regulatory processes and to avoid those regulatory constraints when our goal is to divert the process from its original route. In this article. we discuss the evolutionary forces that act on viral reaction centres and the role of the virus-carried photosynthetic genes in the evolution of photosynthesis.,True,yNrdRDIAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nathan_Nelson/publication/233405600_The_evolution_of_photosystem_I_in_light_of_phage-encoded_reaction_centres/links/540d82ff0cf2f2b29a385d92/The-evolution-of-photosystem-I-in-light-of-phage-encoded-reaction-centres.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nathan_Nelson/publication/233405600_The_evolution_of_photosystem_I_in_light_of_phage-encoded_reaction_centres/links/540d82ff0cf2f2b29a385d92/The-evolution-of-photosystem-I-in-light-of-phage-encoded-reaction-centres.pdf,0,0,0

To address the possible causes of this phenomenon. we made investigative effort to find out whether intermittent hypoxia affects neurogenesis in the adult rat brain by examining the newly divided cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG). The adult rats were treated with 3000 and 5000 m high altitude 4 h per day for 2 weeks consecutively. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine-5-monophosphate (BrdU) immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the BrdU-labeled cells in the SVZ and DG increased after 3000 and 5000 m intermittent hypoxia. The number of BrdU-labeled cells in the SVZ returned to normal level 4 weeks following intermittent hypoxia. However. the BrdU-labeled cells in the DG had a twofold increase 4 weeks subsequent to intermittent hypoxia.

Whereas mammalian hair cells are not replaced when lost. in fish they constantly renew and regenerate after injury. In vivo tracking and cell fate analyses of all dividing cells during lateral line hair cell regeneration revealed that support and hair cell progenitors localize to distinct tissue compartments. Importantly. we find that the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in these compartments is controlled by spatially restricted Notch signaling and its inhibition of Wnt-induced proliferation. The ability to simultaneously study and manipulate individual cell behaviors and multiple pathways in vivo transforms the lateral line into a powerful paradigm to mechanistically dissect sensory organ regeneration.

The mean diameter and wall thickness of the synthesized microcapsules were approximately 130 μm and 9 μm. respectively. High thermal stability of the microcapsules with a thermal degradation onset temperature of 350 °C was obtained. The multi-functional coating was fabricated by incorporating the microcapsules containing tung oil into an epoxy matrix. The self-healing and self-lubricating functions were evaluated by corrosion and tribology test. 10 wt% microcapsules embedded in epoxy coating offered optimum results. The microcapsules showed excellent anticorrosion performance in scratched coatings. which was attributed to the formation of a cross-linked polymer film after tung oil was released from the damaged microcapsules.

As a promising technology in the small-cell scenario. coordinated multipoint (CoMP) is proposed to improve cell-edge user throughput by converting inter-cell interference into useful signals. In this paper. we study how reconfigurable fronthaul enabled by optical networks can help improve the CoMP service. According to the baseband unit (BBU) that serves the purposes of coordination. we classify the CoMP service into intra-BBU CoMP and inter-BBU CoMP.

Most current shadow removal methods were proposed for natural images. whereas shadows in remote sensing images show distinct characteristics. We have therefore analyzed the characteristics of shadows in aerial images. and in this paper. we propose a new shadow removal method for aerial images. using nonlocal (NL) operators. In the proposed method. the soft shadow is introduced to replace the traditional binary hard shadow. NL operators are used to regularize the shadow scale and the updated shadow-free image. Furthermore. a spatially adaptive NL regularization is introduced to handle compound shadows.

Previous single-molecule experiments showed that RecBCD recognizes an 8 nt DNA sequence. χ. and lowers its unwinding rate afterward under saturating ATP condition. We have developed a single-molecule force-tethered particle motion (FTPM) method. which is modified from the conventional TPM method. and applied it to study RecBCD motion in detail. In the FTPM experiment. a stretching force is applied to the DNA-bead complex that suppresses the bead's Brownian motion. resulting in an improved spatial resolution at long DNA substrates. Based on the equipartition theorem. the mean-square displacement of the bead's Brownian motion measured by FTPM correlates linearly to DNA extension length with a predicted slope. circumventing the difficulties of …,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:hwNCEvm7wWMC,38,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349509002197,1299907845543567296,/scholar?cites=1299907845543567296,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349509002197,0,0,0

NAG-1 plays remarkable multifunctional roles in controlling diverse physiological and pathological processes including cancer. Like other TGF-β family members. NAG-1 can play dual roles during cancer development and progression by negatively or positively modulating cancer cell behaviors. In glioblastoma brain tumors. NAG-1 appears to act as a tumor suppressor gene; however. the precise underlying mechanisms have not been well elucidated. In the present study. we discovered that overexpression of NAG-1 induced apoptosis in U87 MG. U118 MG. U251 MG. and T98G cell lines via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. but not in A172 and LN-229 cell lines. NAG-1 could induce the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and Smad2/3 in all six tested glioblastoma cell lines. except Smad3 phosphorylation in A172 and LN-229 cell lines. In fact. Smad3 expression and its phosphorylation were almost undetectable in A172 and LN-229 cells. The PI3K inhibitors promoted NAG-1-induced glioblastoma cell apoptosis. while siRNAs to Smad2 and Smad3 decreased the apoptosis rate. NAG-1 also stimulated the direct interaction between Akt and Smad3 in glioblastoma cells. Elevating the level of Smad3 restored the sensitivity to NAG-1-induced apoptosis in A172 and LN-229 cells.

In the presence of ATP. RAD51 forms a nucleoprotein filament on single-stranded DNA. termed the presynaptic filament. to initiate homologous recombination-mediated DNA double-strand break repair. The SWI5-SFR1 complex stabilizes the presynaptic filament and enhances its ability to mediate the homologous DNA pairing reaction. Here we characterize the RAD51 presynaptic filament stabilization function of the SWI5-SFR1 complex using optical tweezers.

Understanding the influence of duckweed (Lemna minor L.). a common floating macrophyte in flooded rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields. on NH3 volatilization and grain yield is required for better management of applied N fertilizer.

Until recently. this reaction was thought to be catalyzed by either of two enzymes: (i) the classical N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS. gene argA) first characterized in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa several decades ago and also present in vertebrates. or (ii) the bifunctional version of ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT. gene argJ) present in Bacteria. Archaea and many Eukaryotes. This paper focuses on a new and surprising aspect of glutamate acetylation. We recently showed that in Moritella abyssi and M. profunda. two marine gamma proteobacteria. the gene for the last enzyme in arginine biosynthesis (argH) is fused to a short sequence that corresponds to the C-terminal. N-acetyltransferase-encoding domain of NAGS and is able to complement an argA mutant of E. coli. Very recently. other authors identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis an independent gene corresponding to this short C-terminal domain and coding for a new type of NAGS. We have investigated the two prokaryotic Domains for patterns of gene-enzyme relationships in the first committed step of arginine biosynthesis. The argH-A fusion. designated argH(A). and discovered in Moritella was found to be present in (and confined to) marine gamma proteobacteria of the Alteromonas- and Vibrio- like group.

Facial deformities and joint contractures are avoided by transplanting vascularized full-thickness skin on wounds. The major drawback of this technique is the injury inflicted upon the donor site. which corresponds to a third degree burn. The usual technique to cover the flap donor site is the transplantation of split-thickness autografts.

Large differences on peak position and peak shape are observed between different growth sectors. the shift of the one-phonon diamond Raman peak is the largest in homoepitaxial (111) growth sector. These differences are due to different boron doping ratios in different growth sectors. the (111) growth sector contains more boron than the (100) growth sector. Fano-type interference appears in all spectra. the interference intensity increases with the increase of boron incorporation density. Upon boron doping. some luminescence emission bands due to nitrogen and silicon are quenched. the reason for this phenomena is the dramatic reduction of vacancies upon the incorporation of boron acceptors.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:X3dzGb15QAoC,19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925963500003022,2440045660784565118,/scholar?cites=2440045660784565118,,,0,0,0

100971,Departments of Biochemistry,1981,Hongyuan Li and L Byeon In-ja and Yong Ju and Ming-daw Tsai,,,,,,* Corresponding authors Recent studies by use of short phosphopeptides showed that forkheadassociated (FHA) domains recognize pTXX (D/I/L) motifs. Solution structures and crystal structures of several different FHA domains and their complexes with short phosphopeptides have been reported by several groups. We now report the solution structure of the FHA domain of human Ki67. a large nuclear protein associated with the cell-cycle. Using fragments of its binding partner hNIFK. we show that Ki67-hNIFK binding involves ca 44 residues without a pTXX (D/I/L) motif. The pThr site of hNIFK recognized by Ki67 FHA is pThr234-Pro235. a motif also recognized by the proline isomerase Pin1. Heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR was then used to map out the binding surface. and structural analyses were used to identify key binding residues of Ki67 FHA. The results represent the first structural characterization of the complex of an FHA domain with a biologically relevant target protein fragment. Detailed analyses of the results led us to propose that three major factors control the interaction of FHA with its target protein: the pT residue. þ1 toþ3 residues. and an extended binding surface. and that variation in the three factors is the likely cause of the great diversity in the function and specificity of FHA domains from different sources.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:LGA7_l5-FVwC,19,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.385.5234,6770863153752988454,/scholar?cites=6770863153752988454,,,0,0,0

The plsX gene is co-localized with a bacterial fab gene cluster which encodes several key fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes. The protein is a member of a large. conserved protein family (Pfam02504) found exclusively in bacteria. The PlsX sequence homologues include both phosphate acetyltransferases and phosphate butaryltransferases that catalyze the transfer of an acetyl or butaryl group to orthophosphate.

A general variational topographic correction (TC) framework is proposed in this paper by considering not only self shadows but also cast shadows. Cast shadows are first detected by integrating the radiometric and topographic features of the observed region. The cosine values of the incidence angles for the cast shadows are then corrected by the variational framework. The corrected incidence angles can be used in any traditional TC model to compensate for the shadows in mountainous regions. The proposed variational framework was utilized in eight different traditional TC models. and the results were compared with the traditional results. Images from two different regions were employed to test the framework.

The clinical baseline characteristics prior to the operation were collected. In addition. therapeutic responses were assessed by the short-term outcomes within 30 days postoperation. as well as long-term outcomes at 1 year postoperation. Our findings showed that. in comparison with tPA. uPA was able to better promote hematoma evacuation and ameliorate perihematomal edema. but the differences were not statistically significant. Moreover. the long-term functional outcomes of both groups were similar. with no statistical difference. In conclusion. these results provide evidence supporting that uPA and tPA are similar in the efficacy and safety for thrombolytic evacuation in combination with MISP in patients with spontaneous basal ganglia ICH.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:CWT8puhM_EkC,14,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2017.00371/full,14314979590991366094,/scholar?cites=14314979590991366094,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2017.00371/full,0,0,0

Thus. we require a unified control and management of time. spectrum and mode. which is a necessary standardization for PONs. For this end. the multi-dimensional and flexible PON (Mflexi-PON) will emerge as an ideal solution of supporting the heterogeneous access with different resource multiplexing ways. But a high-efficient Mflexi-PON has its own problem. In term of the physical layer of Mflexi-PONs. some signals include a series of orthogonal subcarriers. or transmission modes should have the orthogonal property. Once multiple subcarriers have the same phase. the instantaneous power of a signal will exceed the average value. thus leading to a high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR).

Motion artifact and respiratory artifact can lead to baseline drift in ICG signal. particularly during or after exercise. which can cause errors when calculating hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents an LMS-based adaptive filtering algorithm to suppress the respiratory artifact of ICG signal without restricting patients’ breath. Estimation of hemodynamic parameters requires error-free automatic extraction of the characteristic points.

New York. NY,The goal of structural biology is to reveal details of the molecular structure of proteins in order to understand their function and mechanism. X-ray crystallography and NMR are the two best methods for atomic level structure determination. However. these methods require milligram quantities of proteins. In this chapter a reproducible methodology for large-scale protein production applicable to a diverse set of proteins is described. The approach is based on protein expression in E. coli as a fusion with a cleavable affinity tag that was tested on over 20.000 proteins.

A method is proposed to compensate the degrading electromagnetic performances induced by the main reflector deformation of the large and shaped Cassegrain antenna by adjusting the subreflector position in real time. Segmented parabola fitting based on the least squares method of the theoretical discrete data of the main shaped reflector yields a standard group of parabolic torus that is later used to fit the deformed main reflector. with all the parabolic toruses confocal in the fitting. The optimised best-fit parameters and the matching between the main reflector and subreflector calculate the adjustment quantity of the subreflector.

We consider the development of microinstabilities in the diffusion region during the emergence process and we propose four different types of reconnection. by which we explain the preheating. as well as the impulsive phase of flares. We find that during the emergence of new magnetic flux the current sheet will not ‘jump’ from the initial classical state to a fully turbulent one. but will remain in a marginally turbulent state which may develop either gradually or impulsively depending on the conditions of emergence. As a consequence of this. we find that four cases of reconnection are indeed possible: a week gradual heating. a weak impulsive process. a gradual preheating followed by an impulsive phase. and violent bursty reconnection.The expansion rate of the diffusion region. the duration of the gradual phase. the …,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:cTdzRpWJKHEC,14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00152025,13636387139636184828,/scholar?cites=13636387139636184828,,http://adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1987SoPh..107..271L,0,0,0

In the initial growth status. the semi-spherical ZnO nuclei were preferably deposited near the growth steps on the terraces and the boundaries of diamond grains. With increasing the growth time. the [0 0 0 1] orientated ZnO nanorods appeared and further covered the whole diamond film. It is found that the size of diamond grains would determine the diameter of ZnO nanorods. The electron field emission properties of the ZnO nanorods/diamond system have been significantly improved with respect to pure diamond film.

As a demonstration. this combined quantum chemistry calculation with the GP-GRNN approach has been applied to evaluate the homolysis BDE of 92 Y-NO organic molecules. The results show that the full-descriptor GRNN without GRA and PCA (F-GRNN) and with GRA (G-GRNN) approaches reduce the root-mean-square (RMS) of the calculated homolysis BDE of 92 organic molecules from 5.31 to 0.49 and 0.39 kcal mol− 1 for the B3LYP/6-31G (d) calculation. Then the newly developed GP-GRNN approach further reduces the RMS to 0.31 kcal mol− 1. Thus. the GP-GRNN correction on top of B3LYP/6-31G (d) can improve the accuracy of calculating the homolysis BDE in quantum chemistry and can predict homolysis BDE which cannot be obtained experimentally.

Nevertheless. its interpretation is mostly done by medical experts due to high error rates of computerized interpretation. One study found that only about 66% of AF were correctly recognized from noisy ECGs. This is in part due to insufficient training data. class skewness. as well as semantical ambiguities caused by noisy segments in an ECG record. In this paper. we propose a K-margin-based Residual-Convolution-Recurrent neural network (K-margin-based RCR-net) for AF detection from noisy ECGs. In detail. a skewness-driven dynamic augmentation method is employed to handle the problems of data inadequacy and class imbalance. A novel RCR-net is proposed to automatically extract both long-term rhythm-level and local heartbeat-level characters. Finally. we present a K-margin-based diagnosis model to automatically focus on the most important parts of an ECG record and handle noise by naturally exploiting expected consistency among the segments associated for each record.

The infrared spectra of the palmitate and stearate are similar as expected. but the bands of the myristate salt show additional splitting in the methylene rocking and twisting bands. A number of other factors of the myristate spectrum and of the infrared hole burning are unique as well. The differences show that the myristate salt has two molecules per spectroscopic unit cell. which are postulated to differ by small rotations of the polar carboxyl groups relative to the plane of the chain.

Septic encephalopathy (SE) is an early sign of sepsis and associated with an increased rate of morbidity and mortality. Microglia activation plays an important role in neuroinflammation. which contributes to neuronal damage. Inhibition of microglia activation may have therapeutic benefits. which can alleviate the progression of neurodegeneration. Therefore. we investigated the functional changes of mice microglia cell lines pre-treated with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced by SWNHs. To address this question. the research about direct role of SWNHs on the growth. proliferation. and apoptosis of microglia cell lines in mice (N9 and BV2) pre-treated with or without LPS had been performed. Our results indicate that the particle diameter of SWNHs in water is between 342 to 712 nm.

After structural optimization. for the pure (110) diamond nanofilms at n = 1 and 2. the original buckling 2D diamonds reconstruct into the planar graphene. For the pure 2D diamond films at n ≥ 3 and the cases of semi-hydrogenated and full-hydrogenated 2D diamond nanofilms. the original diamond structures are energetically favorable to be maintained. The calculated electronic properties of these optimized structures show that the pure and semi-hydrogenated 2D diamond nanofilms have metallic characteristics. and the full-hydrogenated structures are semiconductors.

However. after the empirical mode decomposition. in the low frequency zone of the original signals. illusive intrinsic mode function (IMF) component can be easily generated. This would interfere with the extraction of characteristic information. resulting in erroneous judgment. An improved HHT method and its discrimination conditions on the basis of energy fluctuation were advanced. The principle of energy degradation for component signals was applied in this method. Discrimination threshold was set to track and screen the illusive components. The validity of this method was validated by simulation signals. and practical application was carried out with an example of dynamic signals of prototype hydroturbine on a non-optimal operating condition.

The nanopyramid grains are formed by a vaporization and secondary nucleation on BDD surface to test the trace level of an environmental hormone pollutant of 4-nonylphenol (4-NP).

Ltd,Melt ponds are a common feature on Arctic sea ice. They are linked to the sea ice surface albedo and transmittance of energy to the ocean from the atmosphere and thus constitute an important process to parameterize in Arctic climate models and simulations. This paper presents a first attempt to retrieve the melt pond fraction from hybrid‐polarized compact polarization (CP) SAR imagery. which has wider swath and shorter revisit time than the quad‐polarization systems. eg. from RADARSAT‐2 (RS‐2). The co‐polarization (co‐pol) ratio has been verified to provide estimates of melt pond fractions. However. it is a challenge to link CP parameters and the co‐pol ratio.

Although ICU are equipped with advanced monitoring devices or high ratio of medical resources. the mortality for patients in ICU is still high (1). Moreover. decisions in the ICU are frequently made in the setting of a high degree of uncertainty. In fact. even experienced ICU workers are confused in estimating the risk or probability of death for patients only by their experiences (2). Therefore. a databased prediction tool is highly necessary and considerable efforts have been invested into this field. Several severity scoring models. now called risk prediction model. which can determine illness severity and predict patient mortality by integrating a variety of information have been developed. Among these scoring models. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE I–IV)(2-5). simplified acute physiology score (SAPS I–III)(6-8). and mortality probability models (MPM I–III)(1. 9. 10) are the most popular models.

The secondary ischemia that develops following the initial mechanical insult is a serious complication of the SCI and severely impairs the function and viability of surviving neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the SC. In addition. ischemia is also responsible for the growth of lesion during chronic phase of injury and interferes with the cellular repair and healing processes. Thus there is a need to develop a spinal cord ischemia model for studying the mechanisms of ischemia-induced pathology. Focal ischemia induced by photothrombosis (PT) is a minimally invasive and very well established procedure used to investigate the pathology of ischemia-induced cell death in the brain. Here. we describe the use of PT to induce an ischemic lesion in the spinal cord of mice. Following retro-orbital sinus injection of Rose Bengal. the posterior spinal vein and other capillaries on the dorsal surface of SC were irradiated with a green light resulting in the formation of a thrombus and thus ischemia in the affected region. Results from histology and immunochemistry studies show that PT-induced ischemia caused spinal cord infarction. loss of neurons and reactive gliosis. Using this technique a highly reproducible and relatively easy model of SCI in mice can be achieved that would serve the purpose of scientific investigations into the mechanisms of ischemia induced cell death as well as the efficacy of neuroprotective drugs.

Fenton reagent significantly reduced arsenic phytotoxicity. uptake by the plants and accumulation in rice grain. This is attributed to oxidation of As3 + to As5 + by hydroxyl radicals and immobilization of arsenate by reacting with precipitating Fe3 + to form practically insoluble compounds. Although this process enhanced the formation of Fe-enriched coatings on root surface. it appears that root plaque had limited effects on inhibiting As uptake since most of the young roots were not covered by iron plaque. It is more likely that As immobilization in the bulk soils play a major role in reducing As flux towards rhizosphere.

Large amounts of the sharing data will be transmitted through fronthaul transport network. In the paper. both integer non-linear programming (INLP) optimization model and adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) are explored to release the capacity pressure of the fronthaul transport network when CoMP is introduced. We also consider the resource allocation problem of the passive optical fronthaul network. The proposed algorithm tries to reduce the downlink bandwidth and improve the optical resource allocation efficiency of the optical fronthaul with minimal influence on the fronthaul topology. During the simulations. three critical factors are considered: (1) the number of cell edge users. (2) the average traffic demand of cell edge users. (3) the size of cell cluster used to enable the CoMP. The simulation results show that the most efficient bandwidth saving and optical resource allocation can be achieved with INLP. while the proposed adaptive GA nearly has the same performance with low computational complexity and fast convergence. which is more applicable for the large-scale fronthaul network.

Inner Mongolia,2012,Hao Yan and FX Huang and He Sun and LQ Zhao and Yong Zhang and Hao Zhang and SZ Li and FF Liu and JS Wang,48,Geology and Exploration,5,932-939,,This work is based on application of the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) analysis technology (Portable near-infrared mineral analyzer of BJKF-1 type) and the Gemcom Surpac three-dimensional modeling software. We have measured the hydrothermal alteration samples collected from the boreholes of the No. 3 belt in the Diyanqinamu area. Inner Mongolia by using the NIR analysis technology. Integrated with field records. we divided the alteration types into propylitization. argillic alteration and sericitic alteration. Combined with previous geological survey data. and utilizing the Canadian Geomon Surpac three-dimensional modeling software. alteration information is tranformed into digital parameters which replace the traditional grade data by the adopting genetic algorithm method. Then we set up the altered orebody block model. and delineated rock alteration zones that characterize porphyry deposits. The alteration zonation in the Diyanqinamu area indicates that the centre of the porphyry mineralization lies in the southeast and southwest of the mine field. It is inferred that the porphyry intrusions could be found beneath the centre of the porphyry internalization. The results in the Diyanqinamu area show that the Gemcom Surpac three-dimensional modeling software can effectively determine the hydrothermal alteration zones and establish mineralization models. interpret and locate the indicators directing to the centre of the porphyry mineralization-alteration. and estimate the mineralization center.

The relationship between reciprocal square capacitance and potential following the Mott-Schottky behavior is limited at a narrow rang of low potentials. At higher potentials. linear relationship between reciprocal capacitance and potential is obtained. which is ascribed to the increasing thickness of the passive film with potential. The donor density of the passive film is influenced by the formation potential of the film. passivator and microstructure. The decrease in the formation potential of the passive film and the existence of reduced or deposited passivator can increase the donor density of the passive film and lead to low resistance to pitting corrosion.

101212,Identification of image operations based on steganalytic features,2015,Haodong Li and Weiqi Luo and Xiaoqing Qiu and Jiwu Huang,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.04718,,,,Image forensics have attracted wide attention during the past decade. Though many forensic methods have been proposed to identify image forgeries. most of them are targeted ones. since their proposed features are highly dependent on the image operation under investigation. The performance of the well-designed features for detecting the targeted operation usually degrades significantly for other operations. On the other hand. a wise attacker can perform anti-forensics to fool the existing forensic methods. making countering anti-forensics become an urgent need. In this paper. we try to find a universal feature to detect various image processing and anti-forensic operations. Based on our extensive experiments and analysis. we find that any image processing/anti-forensic operations would inevitably modify many image pixels. This would change some inherent statistics within original images. which is similar to the case of steganography. Therefore. we model image processing/anti-forensic operations as steganography problems. and propose a detection strategy by applying steganalytic features. With some advanced steganalytic features. we are able to detect various image operations and further identify their types. In our experiments. we have tested several steganalytic features on 11 different kinds of typical image processing operations and 4 kinds of anti-forensic operations. The experimental results have shown that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms the existing forensic methods in both effectiveness and universality.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:tVg3zZbtnc0C,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04718,10831231308765816674,/scholar?cites=10831231308765816674,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04718,0,0,0

CBM is primarily adsorbed in the coal rather than the most conventional gases stored in the pore space. CBM is desorbed from the coal when the coal bed pressure is lower than the critical desorption pressure. and is produced out with water. So. the fluids in coalbed are gas and water in different distributions. This paper introduced a set of transient well test model on the basis of desorption characteristic of CBM. the permeability relationships depended on gas and water distributions and the size of desorption area. The flow state of gas and water was described very well by using the separated areas in the CBM producing process. The model was solved by using finite volume method (FVM). and its type curves were obtained. The effects of the desorption coefficient. the desorption composite radius. the saturation distribution of gas and water. etc on type curves are analyzed.

However. the energy and environmental issues restrain development of aluminum industry. So it is necessary to promote the use of energy saving technology in the aluminum industry. The composition of the cell voltage is analyzed in this paper. It is reasonable that the cell voltage of ordinary flat cathode cell is about 4.05V. The approximate linear relationships between the bubble layer thickness and the anode width is analyzed. Changing the structure of the anode and adding two rows of the vent on the common anode can reduce the gas running distance below carbon anode. anodal bubble voltage and the work voltage of aluminum reduction cells under the same current efficiency of aluminum …,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:bxNerZLeg9kC,5,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-65136-1_97,11960751863144630757,/scholar?cites=11960751863144630757,,,0,0,0

The decay time was faster when the excitation frequency was tuned from the off‐resonance to the resonance of the electronic transition of pentacene. For the resonance case. longer decay times were observed at higher temperatures (∼26 K) than at low temperatures (∼6 K). Two possible mechanisms were considered for the inverse temperature behavior. The shorter decay time in the impurity perturbed domains may be attributed to the increase of a coupling strength on the decay channel from 1385 cm−1 mode to 1365 cm−1 mode by stimulating phonon emission.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:mVcUxdmZzz4C,5,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.465186,13848449816963404389,/scholar?cites=13848449816963404389,,http://hwli-group.mcgill.ca/papers/09-1993jcp-cars.pdf,0,0,0

The helical structure of duplex DNA dictates the change of topological states during strand separation when DNA is constrained. During the repair of DNA double‐stranded breaks. the RecA nucleoprotein filament invades DNA and carries out consecutive strand exchange reactions coupled with duplex DNA strand separation. It has been suggested that torsional strain could be generated and its accumulation could inhibit strand exchange. We used hairpin and nicked DNA substrates to test how torsional strain alters the RecA‐mediated strand exchange efficiency. Single‐molecule tethered particle motion (TPM) experiments showed that torsionally constrained hairpin DNA substrates returned nearly no successful strand exchange events catalyzed by RecA.

To diagnose and analyze such signals. this paper presents an original signal processing method of applying empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and demonstrates the then calculation procedure of intrinsic mode functions and their complexity features. Fault diagnosis of the signals was carried out using the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). and by taking the radial basis function as the kernel function. its relevant parameters were determined through grid search and cross validation. The results show that coupling EMD decomposition with SVM in analysis of complexity features provides a rather accurate device for fault diagnosis and determination of fault type. thus laying a basis for operation and maintenance of hydropower units.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:D6F4R4_9d0gC,4,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-SFXB201612012.htm,6990802686127223018,/scholar?cites=6990802686127223018,,,0,0,0

101277,A Mechanistic Model for CO2 Localized Corrosion of Carbon Steel,2011,Hui Li,,,,,,"Localized corrosion of carbon steel in CO 2 environments is a long-standing challenge faced by the oil and gas industry. Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to elucidating the mechanisms governing localized corrosion of carbon steel. Recent studies have discovered pseudo-passivation of carbon steel under FeCO 3 layer-forming conditions where high saturation level of FeCO 3 and high temperature are typically involved. which appreciably increases the potential of metal. A galvanic coupling mechanism is then proposed for localized corrosion propagation of carbon steel. In this theory. FeCO 3 layer-covered surfaces are considered to undergo a substantial surface pH increase due to the mass transfer limiting effect. which could trigger the formation of pseudo-passive film and result in potential increase of metal surface. In a case where a small portion of this film-covered surface loses the protective film. an active surface that has a lower potential will be exposed. A galvanic cell can then be established between film-covered and active surfaces. which drives the active surface to corrode at a higher rate.

101279,A general multi-relational classification approach using feature generation and selection,2010,Miao Zou and Tengjiao Wang and Hongyan Li and Dongqing Yang,,,,21-33,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Multi-relational classification is an important data mining task. since much real world data is organized in multiple relations. The major challenges come from. firstly. the large high dimensional search spaces due to many attributes in multiple relations and. secondly. the high computational cost in feature selection and classifier construction due to the high complexity in the structure of multiple relations. The existing approaches mainly use the inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques to derive hypotheses or extract features for classification. However. those methods often are slow and sometimes cannot provide enough information to build effective classifiers. In this paper. we develop a general approach for accurate and fast multi-relational classification using feature generation and selection.

In this paper. we compare the electron acceleration efficiency among these structures based on 12 magnetotail reconnection events observed by the Cluster spacecraft in 2001–2006. We used the flux ratio between the energetic electrons (> 50 keV) and lower energy electrons (< 26 keV) to quantify the electron acceleration efficiency. We do not find any specific sequence in which electrons are accelerated within these structures. though the flux pileup region. magnetic island and thin current sheet have higher probabilities to reach the maximum efficiency among the four structures than the density cavity. However. the most efficient electron energization usually occurs outside these structures. We suggest that other structures may also play important roles in energizing electrons. Our results could provide important constraints for the further modeling of electron acceleration during magnetic reconnection.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:zR-pXGLwxqsC,3,https://angeo.copernicus.org/articles/33/1469/2015/,8177316137804507833,/scholar?cites=8177316137804507833,,https://angeo.copernicus.org/articles/33/1469/2015/angeo-33-1469-2015.pdf,0,0,0
101322,Controllability of deterministic complex networks,2015,Xin-Feng Li and Zhe-Ming Lu and Hui Li,26,International Journal of Modern Physics C,03,1550028,World Scientific Publishing Company,Recently. the controllability of complex networks has attracted wide attention of researchers. The main contribution comes from Liu et al. who proposed the structural controllability as an analytical framework for making predictions regarding the control of directed networks in Nature. Since then. the controllability of many model and real networks has been deeply investigated except deterministic complex networks. In this paper. we focus on studying the controllability of deterministic complex networks. We examine six typical deterministic networks. the simulation results show that the minimum number of driver nodes grows linearly with network size. When the network size is large enough. the controllability approximates to a constant not more than 0.4. indicating that the deterministic networks are relatively easy to control. Furthermore. we investigate the characteristics of driver nodes in deterministic complex networks …,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:b1ISl_ktn64C,3,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S012918311550028X,7505728438794339986,/scholar?cites=7505728438794339986,,,0,0,0

In the process-driven method. the process model has significantly influence on the data model. Unfortunately. the existing data model anomalies detection methods are only about the anomalies of data model itself. These methods don’t take the process model into account. Similarly. the process model verification methods also lack for consideration of data model. This paper analyses those anomalies and gives a basic classification of three classes of them. This paper also proposes a model called Data-process Graph (DP-graph) to build up linkage between the data model and process model. Based on DP-Graph.

Of the various approaches to enhance the selectivity use of microreactors to control the reaction pathways has shown considerable promise [1-11]. Microreactors refer to organized and constrained media which provide cavities and/or surfaces to accommodate the molecules of a substrate and allow chemical reaction (s) to occur. The substrate is usually a small molecule of dimensions of several angstroms. and the microreactor is often tens of angstroms or larger. Thus. microreactors are also known as nanoreactors. A combination of microreactor as a medium and light as a reagent potentially offers a new approach toward “clean chemistry.” The implications of this methodology for environmentlly benign synthesis of chemicals are twofold. First. the increased selectivity of the reaction will decrease the production of unwanted side products. Second. in most cases. the use of a microreactor will eliminate the need for expensive and environmentally toxic solvents.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:SuREjsGmJT0C,3,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16945347519589281712&hl=en&oi=scholarr,16945347519589281712,/scholar?cites=16945347519589281712,,,0,0,0

BL irradiation can specially inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of U937 cells. relating to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). The apoptosis is further associated with varying downregulated B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-X L) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) genes. upregulated Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) gene. the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by the BL irradiation process.

Information and Communication Engineers,Crosstalk delay within an on-chip bus can induce severe transmission performance penalties. The Bus-grouping Asynchronous Transmission(BAT) scheme is proposed to mitigate the performance degradation. Furthermore. considering the distinct spatial locality of transition distribution on some types of buses. we use the locality to optimize the BAT. In terms of the implementation. we propose the Differential Counter Cluster (DCC) synchronous mechanism to synchronize the data transmission. and the Delay Active Shielding(DAS) to protect some critical signals from crosstalk and optimize the routing area overhead. The BAT is scalable with the variation of bus width with little extra implementation complexity. The effectiveness of the BAT is evaluated by focusing on the on-chip buses of a superscalar microprocessor simulator using the SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks. When applied to a 64-bit on-chip instruction bus. the BAT scheme. compared with the conservative approach.

Shandong are examined on the basis of drilling cores. thin sections. microprobe (analysis). scanning electron microscopy. cathodoluminescence and X-ray diffraction analysis. The reservoir rocks consist mostly of lithic arkose. The dissolution is believed to be a dominantly constructive diagenesis. whereas the compaction. filling and cementation of authigenic minerals are considered as a dominantly destructive diagenesis. The diagenesis may be ascribed to the A substage of the late diagenetic stages. The highly dissolution during the late diagenetic stages was responsible for the formation of the higher porosity of the reservoir rocks. The genetic mechanisms of the low porosity of the reservoir rocks include the compaction. filling and cementation of authigenic minerals during the late diagenetic stages. The isolated and disconnected interparticle porosities caused by the dissolution permitted the low permeable microthroats to be developed. The good porosity associations consist of interparticle porosity-primary interparticle porosity-intraparticle cracks.

The TiO2 thin film fabricated on the 6061 aluminum alloy substrates appears as bamboo-like structures with holes. whereas that prepared on anodized pure aluminum substrate has one-dimensional tubular structures. The main reason is that magnesium in aluminum alloy is oxidized to form magnesium oxide which has a lower volume than that of Al2O3. The photocatalytic ability of the TiO2 films prepared on the aluminum alloy is superior to that of the films fabricated on the pure aluminum. TiO2 prepared on aluminum alloy has higher specific surface area due to its bamboo-like structures with holes. leading to better performance in the degradation of methylene blue.

Our earlier crystal structure of the hexameric helicase from Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA426 (GkDnaC) in complex with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) suggested several key residues responsible for DNA binding that likely play a role in DNA translocation during the unwinding process. Here. we demonstrated that the unwinding activities of mutants with substitutions at these key residues in GkDnaC are 2–4-fold higher than that of wild-type protein. We also observed the faster unwinding velocities in these mutants using single-molecule experiments. A partial loss in the interaction of helicase with ssDNA leads to an enhancement in helicase efficiency. while their ATPase activities remain unchanged. In strong contrast. adding accessory proteins (DnaG or DnaI) to GkDnaC helicase alters the ATPase. unwinding efficiency and the unwinding velocity of the helicase. It suggests that the unwinding velocity of helicase could be modulated by two different pathways. the efficiency of ATP hydrolysis or protein-DNA interaction.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:PGOTqER0XmoC,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029016,11063960464377742461,/scholar?cites=11063960464377742461,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029016,0,0,0

101532,Optimizing the cost of migration from wireless tdm networks to next generation packet networks,2008,Huan Li and Haitao Lin and Hee Lee and Prabir Das,,,,1-8,IEEE,The major wireless operators are actively migrating their networks from circuit switched networks to all packet (IP) based next generation networks. One of the key issues impeding the migration is the associated cost. Though managing the CAPEX (CAPital EXpenditures) and OPEX (OPerational EXpenditure) has been the focus of the operators. minimizing the cost from the perspective of system design has received relatively less attention. In this paper. we investigate a particular trunk allocation problem in a circuit/packet hybrid switch to show how system and algorithm design can significantly reduce the migration cost. so that the operators achieve cost effective migration. In such a problem. allocating different trunk types to the two legs of a call/session results in utilization of a special hardware - an interworking unit to bridge the two types of trunks (TDM and IP) so that the call can be completed.

Since management activities frequently desire to optimize certain indicators in various proportions. such as financial planning (debt/equity ratio). production planning (output/employee ratio). etc.. many decisional models have been considered as fractional programs. Accordingly. linear fractional programming has been widely applied in numerous management problems due to its simplicity.

In order to study the quantitative characteristics of growth plasticity and the allocation patterns of Agropyron michnoi cohort clones at the second year in the Songnen Plain under artificial planting condition. large sampling analysis was used. The results showed that coefficient of variation of tuft diameter in Agropyron michnoi cohort clones was 31.7%. Coefficient of variation of reproductive and vegetative ramets number were 78.5% and 63.0%. respectively; their coefficient of variation in biomass were 89.8% and 64.3%. respectively. Coefficient of variation of rhizome length and thousand seed weight were 111.4% and 8.4%. respectively. These results indicated that there were different degrees of plasticity in the quantitative characters of clonal modules. The plasticity of production was higher than growth. and the plasticity of quantitative characters of clonal modules in reproductive ramets were higher than vegetative ramets. The plasticity of potential clonal modules was higher than the present modules. The plasticity of the lowest was seed quality. lower than that of other quantitative traits related to growth and sexual reproduction. The regulating function of Agropyron michnoi clones mainly displayed in: the relationship between the clone size and the plasticity of production and growth followed the law of allometric or isogony growth and there was a trade-off between sexual reproduction and vegetative growth.[Fund]: 国家自然科学基金项目 (31672471); 国家自然科学基金面上项目 (31670427) 资助;; 国家重点研发项目 (2016YFC0500602);; 吉林省科技厅 …,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:TmOvQRHOa3sC,0,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-CDXU201804003.htm,,,,,0,0,0

101574,A Virtual Reality Dance Self-learning Framework using Laban Movement Analysis.,2017,Guoyu Sun and Wenjuan Chen and Haiyan Li and Qingjie Sun and Matthew Kyan and Pengzhou Zhang,10,Journal of Engineering Science & Technology Review,5,,,The capabilities of general motion evaluation algorithms are significantly limited in analyzing the stylistic qualities and expressions of dance movement. This study proposes a novel dance self-learning framework on the basis of the principles of Laban movement analysis (LMA) to facilitate trainees in automatically analyzing dance movements and correcting dance techniques without an expert. First. a “shape-effort” feature description model was presented in this framework to reflect the subtleties of dance movement. The evaluation of body-shape performance was obtained via open-end dynamic time warping algorithm. Next. rhythm was qualitatively assessed by curve fitting. whereas effort was measured by using standard deviation. Finally. constructive instructions were generated in this framework on basis of the assessment scores of the movement of the trainees. The framework was implemented in cave automatic virtual environment. and its effectiveness and feasibility were verified through experiments. Results demonstrate that the feature description model with 23 LMA parameters can be used in describing dance movements. Multi-mode feedback with direct instructions for the problems in question satisfies the learning habits of the trainee. The quality of the trainees’ movements achieves an average of 10% overall improvement by using the framework. Body-shape performance acquires the most improvement of 18%. followed by effort.

We investigated a hyper-arid Gobi location in the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes in this work wherein the burial depth of phreatic water is over 200 m. An air-conditioner was used in a closed greenhouse to condense and measure the yearly amount of phreatic evaporation (PE) from 2010 to 2015. The results show that the annual quantity of PE is 4.52 mm. and that the PE has sinusoidal characteristics. The average PE is 0.0183 mm d-1 from March to November. Accordingly. by monitoring the annual changes in soil–air temperature and humidity to a depth of 5.0 m. we analyzed the water migration mechanism in the heterothermozone (subsurface zone of variable temperature). The results show that. from March to November. the temperature and absolute humidity (AH) increase. This is due to the flow of solar heat entering the soil – the soil subsequently releases moisture and the soil is in a state of increasing AH so that evaporation occurs. From November to March. the temperature decreases. Now. the soil absorbs water vapor and AH is in a state of decline. Thus. it is temperature alternation in the heterothermozone – due to solar heat transfer – that provides the main driving power for PE. When it drives water vapor to move downwards in the heterothermozone. a small part is reversed upwards and evaporates. Solar radiation intensity dominates the annual sinusoidal PE characteristics.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:-Xpk-jsdKCIC,0,https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/hess-2015-431/,,,,https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/12/13123/2015/hessd-12-13123-2015.pdf,0,0,0

The topography of the CL between droplet and surface is imaged using fluorescence microscopy in combination with high-speed video. To measure the CAH induced resistant force. a micro-force sensor is attached to the droplet and the substrate moved relative to the droplet with prescribed velocity. The resultant force-time curve displays an initial maximum and subsequently a dynamic steady state with a sawtooth-like shape.

In this report. we show our recent progress in wave-particle interaction and precipitating energetic ions/electrons in plasmaspheric plumes with conjugate observations of satellites and ground-based instruments. A direct proof has been shown that electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can be generated in the plasmaspheric plume and scatter RC ions to cause subauroral proton arcs. Both EMIC waves and extremely low frequency (ELF) hiss were simultaneously observed in the plasmaspheric plume. In the region where the EMIC waves were observed. the pitch angle distribution of ions becomes more isotropic. likely due to the pitch angle scattering by the EMIC waves. It is shown that the ELF hiss and EMIC waves are spatially separated: the ELF hiss is located in the vicinity of the electron density peak within the plume while the EMIC waves are detected in the outer boundary of the plume because of the different propagation characteristics of the ELF hiss and EMIC waves. As a result. the peak of precipitating electron flux was equatorward to that of precipitating proton flux at ionospheric altitudes. In addition. we have also presented characteristic of precipitating ring current (RC) ions/electrons and precipitating radiation belt electrons associated with wave-particle interactions in the plasmaspheric plume.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:KEHW5XCvxlQC,0,https://cpfd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CPFDTOTAL-ZGKK201306001060.htm,,,,,0,0,0

The OLS regression results indicate that LAC decreases year by year. which confirms the previous statement about governance transition; large companies tend to have higher LAC and take Boards as the main channel. Furthermore. the findings show that LAC has positive associations with the size of companies and the proportion of shares held by the biggest shareholder. Moreover. companies with higher LAC appear to perform worse in financial reporting and stock market performance. which supports the view of LAC-risk. The ratio of debt to total assets is positively associated with LAC. which confirms the LAC-benefit view about the preferential treatment. The total results show that low administration governance have dual impacts of on the performance of non-state owned companies.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:E9iozgzfyhkC,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6414257/,,,,,0,0,0

With this method. each Radio Frequency chain is not allocated to a single antenna element. but instead to the complex-weighted and combined response of a group array of elements. In this paper. we firstly get optimal solution under no constraints. Then. suboptimal algorithms are introduced based on minimised the squared error and convex optimization technique.

To verify the validity and efficiency in correlation and sensitivity analysis. a simple limit-state function is selected as an example. Subsequently. an 11-bar truss is taken as a numerical example. and main attention is given to parametric sensitivity and failure correlation of this structure. Importance measures consisting of α. γ. δ and η are investigated under deformation capacity limit state. The sensitivity of limit state equation to each random variable and of failure probability to mean and standard deviation of random variables are researched. respectively. Furthermore. correlation between failure modes is also studied. The Polak-He and SQP algorithms are introduced to compute reliability and sensitivity. The main conclusions are as follows: the influence of variance of nodal coordinates on reliability of latticed truss can not be neglected. sometimes variance of nodal coordinates plays a predominant role in reliability analysis; changing laws of the four importance parameters are approximately consistent; SQP and Polak-He. if proper scaling factor is selected. have high efficiency to search for design point.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:luR84W4EXegC,0,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-JZJZ201102004.htm,,,,,0,0,0

Metals and Materials Society/AIME. 420 Commonwealth Dr.. P. O. Box 430 Warrendale PA 15086 USA,Semiconductor nanotube is an emerging material system that has caught limited attention. yet possesses the potential to provide a wide range of functionalities(X. Li. J. Phys. D. 41. 193001. 2008). It is formed by a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches through self-rolling of residually strained thin-films that are epitaxially grown and lithographically defined. This allows feasible large area assembly and integration with existing semiconductor technologies while maintaining control of tube size and heterojunction formation in the tube wall. The tube diameter is determined by the total layer thickness and the mismatch strain in the epitaxial layers. The self-rolling direction is controlled by the anisotropy of the Youngs moduli and. for crystalgraphically equivalent directions. depends on the feature geometry of the thin film.

Different nodes movement models are adopted in traditional networks. but they are hard to meet the necessity of large-time scale disruption and longrange transmissions. So the hotspots model was designed and proposed to increase the probability of transfer and fasten the speed of bundles spreading.

The results show that there was a significantly lower soil residual DDTs concentration in the iron-rich fertilizer-treated soil than in other fertilizer-treated soils. However. all the non-iron-rich fertilizers showed no significant effect on the reduction of soil DDTs on the last day of the experiment. as compared to the control. There was a close relationship between the soil residual DDTs and plant tissue DDTs. This suggests that the uptake rate of DDTs by the plant was dependent on the concentration of soil-borne DDTs. Application of iron-rich fertilizer enhanced the degradation of the soil DDTs and subsequently reduced the uptake of DDTs by the test plant.

However. the effectiveness of computerized SCM system heavily depends on the availability of SCM quantitative formulation. Particularly. a simple change within the supply chain can lead to the complicated dynamics along the whole supply channels. Consequently. to effectively and efficiently arranging the most feasible and promising supply chain schedule requires not only arduous managerial efforts. but also a practical SCM quantitative model. Unfortunately. current mathematical models embedded in prevailing SCM systems either use fixed values or linear functions to replace real-world cost functions or employ heuristics or special purpose algorithms to treat nonlinear cost functions. The former approach is out of the reality. while the latter is hard to be coded in general commercial SCM systems and can not guarantee the computed result is global optimal solution. Accordingly. this work attempts to present some easy-to-handle formulations of treating various types of cost functions such as nonlinear step cost functions. concave cost functions. and S-curve cost functions. and to make current computer-based SCM quantitative models more practical to enhance the execution of more elaborate coordination activities.

101722,A flexible solution for the next generation EPON with hybrid bidirectional 1Gbps and 10Gbps,2007,Weixun Zhang and Yaojun Qiao and Hui Li and Yuefeng Ji,6784,,,67843B,International Society for Optics and Photonics,Ethernet PON (EPON) has been proved to be a successful technology among all the standardized PON systems [1. 2]. in terms of its cost-effective and large bandwidth virtue. And EPON has become a network of a choice for subscriber oriented digital service delivery. taking over the market previously dominated by DSL. However. with the development of advanced video services. the bandwidth capacity of current EPON seems to be not well suited for the future large deployment of triple-play services. Many researches are now taken about the Next Generation EPON; and the recent 10G EPON system standardization effort in the IEEE [3] results a lot of interest in the evolution of current PON systems towards high data rate system capable of providing a future-proof platform for delivery of personalized triple-play services.

At low input powers insufficient to generate streaming in the fluid. colloidal islands are assembled along the drop interface due to the action of the vibration forces directly on the particles. The position and number of these islands directly correlate with the intersection between the nodal positions of the surface waves and that of the induced interfacial capillary wave. As the input power is increased to a critical value corresponding to the onset of fluid streaming. a transient metastable state is observed in which the system oscillates between colloidal island self-assembly in a quiescent fluid and the subsequent temporal erasure of …,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:paYMmCCHv7cC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007APS..DFD.NA006Y/abstract,,,,,0,0,0

Berlin. Heidelberg,While the problem of optimal cell-site partitioning has been primarily studied from the perspective of scarce radio resources in the access network. recent field measurements have shown significant impact of paging load on the core signaling subsystem capacity. In this paper. we revisit the problem of optimal zone partitioning. identifying factors affecting partitioning cost at the core switch. We develop a general integer programming formulation for joint optimization of two key issues: (i) assignment of cells to a base station controller and controllers to the core signaling subsystem. (ii) optimal partitioning of zones at the access and network levels. Given the exponential nature of the location planning problem. we develop a genetic algorithm based approach for solving the general zone partitioning and configuration problem. both for incumbent and greenfield networks.

101726,Driving Cell Seeding Using Surface Acoustic Wave Fluid Actuation,2007,Haiyan Li and James R Friend and Leslie Y Yeo,,,,625-629,School of Engineering. The University of Queensland,In this paper. we investigate the ability to drive fluid streaming via a surface acoustic wave (SAW) into a porous bioscaffold structure. and to exploit this effect to deliver fluorescent particles/yeast cells into the scaffold as a potential rapid and efficient method for cell seeding in tissue engineering. The results demonstrate that the seeding process takes approximately 10 seconds. much shorter than that if the cell suspension were to perfuse through the scaffold under the effects of gravity alone (approximately 30 mins). By increasing the input power. both the velocity of the fluid flow and the particle seeding efficiency can be enhanced. At 560 mW. fluid velocities of the order 10 mm/s were achieved; in this case. the particle/yeast seeding efficiency is around 92%. In addition to rapid seeding. the SAW streaminginduced perfusion is observed to significantly improve the uniformity of the scaffold cell distribution due to greater penetration into the scaffold. Finally. we verify using a methylene violet staining procedure that 80% of the yeast cells seeded by the SAW method within the scaffold remained viable.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:nlk6zB4cO3MC,0,https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/imarusic/proceedings/16/Li.pdf,,,,https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/imarusic/proceedings/16/Li.pdf,0,0,0
101727,Effects of Potassium Chlorate on Soil Animal Communities in an off-Season Longan Orchard,2007,Xiu-yu ZHANG and Hua-shou LI and Xiang-you ZENG and Dong-sheng GUAN,,Journal of Agro-Environment Science,,04,,Historically. chlorates once were used as non-selective contact herbicide. defoliant and desiccant in agriculture. Chlorine dioxide was used for disinfection of drinking water. and bleaching in pulp/paper/textile industries. Chlorate (ClO-3) is produced when chlorine dioxide is incompletely reduced to chloride during the industrial process. Recently potassium chlorate has been applied to stimulate the reproduction of longan trees for out-of-season fruit in longan orchard. But chlorates are a group of highly oxidizing substances with toxic effects. It can bring about significant ecological risk. There are very few reports available on the toxicity of potassium chlorate to soil animals. especially in out-of-season longan orchard at present. By using standardized researching methods. soil animal community structure and diversity were investigated in an off-season longan orchard used potassium chlorate. Total 6 182 soil animals were captured and identified. they belonged to 4 phyla. 8 classes and 25 orders. and among these animals. Oligchaeta and Hemiptera were the dominant communities. Soil animals mainly appeared in 0~ 10 cm soil layer and decreased with the increase of soil depth. All indexes except Pielou evenness index. including total number of individuals. number of taxonomy groups. Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Simpson dominance index and group density index. had no significant difference among different treatments. This result suggested that applying potassium chlorate at less than 1 000 g per longan tree had little impacts on soil animals in off-season longan orchards in South China.,True,_sayvTQAAAAJ:ZDu_srLEjN8C,0,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-NHBH200704060.htm,,,,,0,0,0

Space structure of formation flying satellites is steady and the orbits of concomitance satellites around reference satellite are closed. which means high precision of satellite-location in space without frequent orbit trimming. GDOP was introduced to describe ability of system positioning and passive positioning method of TDOA was used to calculate radiant-point on earth. Simulation results show that the positioning-precision of this system is 10 m and even better. The way to achieve higher positioning-precision is baseline-growth and precision- improvement of time measure of signal arrival.
