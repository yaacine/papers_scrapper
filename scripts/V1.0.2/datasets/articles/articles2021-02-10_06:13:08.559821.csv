True complex disease-associated loci often exert modest effects. so their delineation currently requires integration of diverse phenotypic data from large studies to ensure robust meta-analyses. We have designed a gene-centric 50 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to assess potentially relevant loci across a range of cardiovascular. metabolic and inflammatory syndromes. The array utilizes a “cosmopolitan” tagging approach to capture the genetic diversity across ∼2.000 loci in populations represented in the HapMap and SeattleSNPs projects. The array content is informed by GWAS of vascular and inflammatory disease. expression quantitative trait loci implicated in atherosclerosis. pathway based approaches and comprehensive literature searching. The custom flexibility of the array platform facilitated interrogation of loci at differing stringencies. according to a gene prioritization strategy that allows saturation of high priority loci with a greater density of markers than the existing GWAS tools. particularly in African HapMap samples. We also demonstrate that the IBC array can be used to complement GWAS. increasing coverage in high priority CVD-related loci across all major HapMap populations.

This technology thus offers an important source of genomic sequence annotation that is complementary to cDNA sequencing and computational gene-finding methods. Recent ‘tiling’ microarray experiments that assay transcription at regular intervals throughout the genome have shown evidence of large amounts of transcription outside the boundaries of known genes. This transcription is observed in polyadenylated RNA samples and appears to be derived from intergenic regions. from introns of known genes and from sequences antisense to known transcripts.

Diverse molecular mechanisms have evolved to effectively balance the expressed dose of X-linked genes between XX and XY animals. and to balance expression of X and autosomal genes. Dosage compensation is not understood in birds. in which females (ZW) and males (ZZ) differ in the number of Z chromosomes. Using microarray analysis. we compared the male:female ratio of expression of sets of Z-linked and autosomal genes in two bird species. zebra finch and chicken. and in two mammalian species. mouse and human. Male:female ratios of expression were significantly higher for Z genes than for autosomal genes in several finch and chicken tissues. In contrast. in mouse and human the male:female ratio of expression of X-linked genes is quite similar to that of autosomal genes. indicating effective dosage compensation even in humans. in which a significant percentage of genes escape X-inactivation. Birds represent an unprecedented case in which genes on one sex chromosome are expressed on average at constitutively higher levels in one sex compared with the other.

Bayesian networks provide a convenient framework for extracting relationships from noisy data and are frequently applied to large-scale data to derive causal relationships among variables of interest. Given the complexity of molecular networks underlying common human disease traits. and the fact that biological networks can change depending on environmental conditions and genetic factors. large datasets. generally involving multiple perturbations (experiments). are required to reconstruct and reliably extract information from these networks. With limited resources. the balance of coverage of multiple perturbations and multiple subjects in a single perturbation needs to be considered in the experimental design. Increasing the number of experiments. or the number of subjects in an experiment. is an expensive and time-consuming way to improve network reconstruction. Integrating multiple types of data from existing subjects might be more efficient. For example. it has recently been demonstrated that combining genotypic and gene expression data in a segregating population leads to improved network reconstruction. which in turn may lead to better predictions of the effects of experimental perturbations on any given gene.

Recently there has been some effort to coalesce non-biased high-throughput data. e.g. high density genotyping and genome wide RNA expression. to drive understanding of the molecular basis of disease. However. a stumbling block has been the difficult question of how to leverage this information to identify molecular mechanisms that explain quantitative trait loci (QTL). We have developed a formal statistical hypothesis test. resulting in a p-value. to quantify uncertainty in a causal inference pertaining to a measured factor. e.g. a molecular species. which potentially mediates a known causal association between a locus and a quantitative trait. We treat the causal inference as a 'chain' of mathematical conditions that must be satisfied to conclude that the potential mediator is causal for the trait. where the inference is only as good as the weakest link in the chain. P-values are computed for the component conditions. which include tests of linkage and conditional independence. The Intersection-Union Test. in which a series of statistical tests are combined to form an omnibus test. is then employed to generate the overall test result. Using computer simulated mouse crosses. we show that type I error is low under a variety of conditions that include hidden variables and reactive pathways.

However. to date. the massive data generated from GWAS have not been maximally explored to identify true associations that fail to meet the stringent level of association required to achieve genome-wide significance. Genetics of gene expression (GGE) studies have shown promise towards identifying DNA variations associated with disease and providing a path to functionally characterize findings from GWAS. Here. we present the first empiric study to systematically characterize the set of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with expression (eSNPs) in liver. subcutaneous fat. and omental fat tissues. demonstrating these eSNPs are significantly more enriched for SNPs that associate with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in three large-scale GWAS than a matched set of randomly selected SNPs. This enrichment for T2D association increases as we restrict to eSNPs that correspond to genes comprising gene networks constructed from adipose gene expression data isolated from a mouse population segregating a T2D phenotype. Finally. by restricting to eSNPs corresponding to genes comprising an adipose subnetwork strongly predicted as causal for T2D. we dramatically increased the enrichment for SNPs associated with T2D and were able to identify a functionally related set of diabetes susceptibility genes. We identified and validated malic enzyme 1 (Me1) as a key regulator of this T2D subnetwork in mouse and provided support for the association of this gene to T2D in humans.

The effects of gender on the regulation of many physiological traits are well documented; however. “genetical genomic” analyses have not yet addressed the degree to which their conclusions are affected by sex. We constructed and densely genotyped a large F2 intercross derived from the inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ on an apolipoprotein E null (ApoE−/−) background. This BXH.ApoE−/− population recapitulates several “metabolic syndrome” phenotypes. The cross consists of 334 animals of both sexes. allowing us to specifically test for the dependence of linkage on sex. We detected several thousand liver gene expression quantitative trait loci. a significant proportion of which are sex-biased. We used these analyses to dissect the genetics of gonadal fat mass. a complex trait with sex-specific regulation. We present evidence for a remarkably high degree of sex-dependence on both the cis and trans regulation of gene expression. We demonstrate how these analyses can be applied to the study of the genetics underlying gonadal fat mass. a complex trait showing significantly female-biased heritability.

Methods and Findings We conducted an association study of body mass index (BMI) and differential methylation for over 400.000 CpGs assayed by microarray in whole-blood-derived DNA from 3.743 participants in the Framingham Heart Study and the Lothian Birth Cohorts. with independent replication in three external cohorts of 4.055 participants. We examined variations in whole blood gene expression and conducted Mendelian randomization analyses to investigate the functional and clinical relevance of the findings. We identified novel and previously reported BMI-related differential methylation at 83 CpGs that replicated across cohorts; BMI-related differential methylation was associated with concurrent changes in the expression of genes in lipid metabolism pathways. Genetic instrumental variable analysis of alterations in methylation at one of the 83 replicated CpGs. cg11024682 (intronic to sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 [SREBF1]). demonstrated links to BMI. adiposity-related traits. and coronary artery disease. Independent genetic instruments for expression of SREBF1 supported the findings linking methylation to adiposity and cardiometabolic disease. Methylation at a substantial proportion (16 of 83) of the identified loci was found to be secondary to differences in BMI. However. the cross-sectional nature of the data limits definitive causal determination.

Hundreds of these loci have been detected. but only a small number of the underlying causative genes have been identified. The main difficulty is the extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) in intercross progeny and the slow process of fine-scale mapping by traditional methods. Recently. new approaches have been introduced. such as association studies with inbred lines and multigenerational crosses. These approaches are very useful for interval reduction. but generally do not provide single-gene resolution because of strong LD extending over one to several megabases. Here. we investigate the genetic structure of a natural population of mice in Arizona to determine its suitability for fine-scale LD mapping and association studies. There are three main findings: (1) Arizona mice have a high level of genetic variation. which includes a large fraction of the sequence variation present in classical strains of laboratory mice; (2) they show clear evidence of local inbreeding but appear to lack stable population structure across the study area; and (3) LD decays with distance at a rate similar to human populations. which is considerably more rapid than in laboratory populations of mice. Strong associations in Arizona mice are limited primarily to markers less than 100 kb apart. which provides the possibility of fine-scale association mapping at the level of one or a few genes.

Quantitative trait locus analyses were applied to the subcutaneous fat-mass trait and all gene-expression data. These data were then used to identify gene sets that are differentially perturbed in lean and obese mice. We integrated global gene-expression data with phenotypic and genetic segregation analyses to evaluate metabolic pathways associated with obesity. Using two approaches we identified 13 metabolic pathways whose genes are coordinately regulated in association with obesity. Four genomic regions on chromosomes 3. 6. 16. and 19 were found to control the coordinated expression of these pathways. Using criteria that included trait correlation. differential gene expression. and linkage to genomic regions. we identified novel genes potentially associated with the identified pathways.

In part. failure to treat these two aggressive cancers successfully centers on the fact that while the majority of patients are diagnosed based on current surveillance strategies as having a complete clinical response to their primary therapy. nearly half will develop disease recurrence within 18 months and the majority will die from disease recurrence within 5 years. Moreover. no currently used biomarkers or imaging studies can predict outcome following initial treatment. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a theoretically powerful biomarker for detecting otherwise occult disease. We therefore explored the use of personalized ctDNA markers as both a surveillance and prognostic biomarker in gynecologic cancers and compared this to current FDA-approved surveillance tools.   Methods and Findings Tumor and serum samples were collected at time of surgery and then throughout treatment course for 44 patients with gynecologic cancers. representing 22 ovarian cancer cases. 17 uterine cancer cases. one peritoneal. three fallopian tube. and one patient with synchronous fallopian tube and uterine cancer.

Because of the large number of genes and genetic markers in such analyses. it is extremely challenging to discover how a small number of eQTLs interact with each other to affect mRNA expression levels for a set of co-regulated genes. We present a Bayesian method to facilitate the task. in which co-expressed genes mapped to a common set of markers are treated as a module characterized by latent indicator variables. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is designed to search simultaneously for the module genes and their linked markers. We show by simulations that this method is more powerful for detecting true eQTLs and their target genes than traditional QTL mapping methods. We applied the procedure to a data set consisting of gene expression and genotypes for 112 segregants of S. cerevisiae. Our method identified modules containing genes mapped to previously reported eQTL hot spots. and dissected these large eQTL hot spots into several modules corresponding to possibly different biological functions or primary and secondary responses to regulatory perturbations. In addition. we identified nine modules associated with pairs of eQTLs. of which two have been previously reported. We demonstrated that one of the novel modules containing many daughter-cell expressed genes is regulated by AMN1 and BPH1.

As with most cancers. it is a heterogeneous disease and different breast cancer subtypes are treated differently. Understanding the difference in prognosis for breast cancer based on its molecular and phenotypic features is one avenue for improving treatment by matching the proper treatment with molecular subtypes of the disease. In this work. we employed a competition-based approach to modeling breast cancer prognosis using large datasets containing genomic and clinical information and an online real-time leaderboard program used to speed feedback to the modeling team and to encourage each modeler to work towards achieving a higher ranked submission. We find that machine learning methods combined with molecular features selected based on expert prior knowledge can improve survival predictions compared to current best-in-class methodologies and that ensemble models trained across multiple user submissions systematically outperform individual models within the ensemble. We also find that model scores are highly consistent across multiple independent evaluations.

10097211,An integrative multi-network and multi-classifier approach to predict genetic interactions,2010,Gaurav Pandey and Bin Zhang and Aaron N Chang and Chad L Myers and Jun Zhu and Vipin Kumar and Eric E Schadt,6,PLoS computational biology,9,e1000928,Public Library of Science,Genetic interactions occur when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype. These interactions capture functional redundancy. and thus are important for predicting function. dissecting protein complexes into functional pathways. and exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of common human diseases. Synthetic sickness and lethality are the most studied types of genetic interactions in yeast. However. even in yeast. only a small proportion of gene pairs have been tested for genetic interactions due to the large number of possible combinations of gene pairs. To expand the set of known synthetic lethal (SL) interactions. we have devised an integrative. multi-network approach for predicting these interactions that significantly improves upon the existing approaches. First. we defined a large number of features for characterizing the relationships between pairs of genes from various data sources. In particular. these features are independent of the known SL interactions. in contrast to some previous approaches. Using these features. we developed a non-parametric multi-classifier system for predicting SL interactions that enabled the simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures.

Many of these factors impact also on white adipose tissue (WAT). which has been shown to be a determinant of lifespan. Interrogating a transcriptional network for predicted causal regulatory interactions in a collection of mouse WAT from F2 crosses with a seed set of 60 known longevity genes. we identified a novel transcriptional subnetwork of 742 genes which represent thus-far-unknown longevity genes. Within this subnetwork. one gene was Pparg (Nr1c3). an adipose-enriched nuclear receptor previously not associated with longevity. In silico. both the PPAR signaling pathway and the transcriptional signature of Pparγ agonist rosiglitazone overlapped with the longevity subnetwork. while in vivo. lowered expression of Pparg reduced lifespan in both the lipodystrophic Pparg1/2-hypomorphic and the Pparg2-deficient mice.

Genetic. epigenetic. and environmental factors are known to contribute to COPD risk and disease progression. Therefore we developed a systematic approach to identify key regulators of COPD that integrates genome-wide DNA methylation. gene expression. and phenotype data in lung tissue from COPD and control samples. Our integrative analysis identified 126 key regulators of COPD. We identified EPAS1 as the only key regulator whose downstream genes significantly overlapped with multiple genes sets associated with COPD disease severity. EPAS1 is distinct in comparison with other key regulators in terms of methylation profile and downstream target genes. Genes predicted to be regulated by EPAS1 were enriched for biological processes including signaling. cell communications. and system development. We confirmed that EPAS1 protein levels are lower in human COPD lung tissue compared to non-disease controls and that Epas1 gene expression is reduced in mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke. As EPAS1 downstream genes were significantly enriched for hypoxia responsive genes in endothelial cells. we tested EPAS1 function in human endothelial cells. EPAS1 knockdown by siRNA in endothelial cells impacted genes that significantly overlapped with EPAS1 downstream genes in lung tissue including hypoxia responsive genes. and genes associated with emphysema severity.

Previously. we showed that food intake has a large impact on blood gene expression patterns and that these responses. either in terms of gene expression level or gene-gene connectivity. are strongly associated with metabolic diseases. In this study. we explored which genes drive the changes of gene expression patterns in response to time and food intake. We applied the Granger causality test and the dynamic Bayesian network to gene expression data generated from blood samples collected at multiple time points during the course of a day. The simulation result shows that combining many short time series together is as powerful to infer Granger causality as using a single long time series. Using the Granger causality test. we identified genes that were supported as the most likely causal candidates for the coordinated temporal changes in the network. These results show that PER1 is a key regulator of the blood transcriptional network. in which multiple biological processes are under circadian rhythm regulation. The fasted and fed dynamic Bayesian networks showed that over 72% of dynamic connections are self links.

We show that these are determined by∼ 9720 regulatory modules. of which∼ 3000 operate in multiple tissues and∼ 970 on multiple genes. We identify regulatory modules that drive the disease association for 63 of the 200 risk loci. and show that these are enriched in multigenic modules. Based on these analyses. we resequence 45 of the corresponding 100 candidate genes in 6600 Crohn disease (CD) cases and 5500 controls. and show with burden tests that they include likely causative genes.

10097229,A systems biology approach to drug discovery,2008,Jun Zhu and Bin Zhang and Eric E Schadt,60,,,603-635,Academic Press,Common human diseases like obesity and diabetes are driven by complex networks of genes and any number of environmental factors. To understand this complexity in hopes of identifying targets and developing drugs against disease. a systematic approach is required to elucidate the genetic and environmental factors and interactions among and between these factors. and to establish how these factors induce changes in gene networks that in turn lead to disease. The explosion of large‐scale. high‐throughput technologies in the biological sciences has enabled researchers to take a more systems biology approach to study complex traits like disease.

However. it remains unknown to what extent robustness varies between individuals. and whether factors buffering environmental variation also buffer genetic variation. Here we introduce a quantitative genetic approach to these issues. and apply this approach to data from three species. In mice. we find suggestive evidence that for hundreds of gene expression traits. robustness is polymorphic and can be genetically mapped to discrete genomic loci. Moreover. we find that the polymorphisms buffering genetic variation are distinct from those buffering environmental variation. In fact. these two classes have quite distinct mechanistic bases: environmental buffers of gene expression are predominantly sex-specific and trans-acting. whereas genetic buffers are not sex-specific and often cis-acting. Data from studies of morphological and life-history traits in plants and yeast support the distinction between polymorphisms buffering genetic and environmental variation. and further suggest that loci buffering different types of environmental variation do overlap with one another. These preliminary results suggest that naturally occurring polymorphisms affecting phenotypic robustness could be abundant. and that these polymorphisms may generally buffer either genetic or environmental variation. but not both.,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC,64,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008635,16344996632820866875,/scholar?cites=16344996632820866875,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008635,0,0,0

Because the model embodies just the right amount of symmetry. it permits explicit calculation of finite-time transition probabilities and equilibrium distributions. The model also meshes well with maximum likelihood methods for phylogenetic analysis.

To derive a systems view of how genetic loci interact in the context of tissue-specific molecular networks. we constructed an F2 intercross comprised of >500 mice from diabetes-resistant (B6) and diabetes-susceptible (BTBR) mouse strains made genetically obese by the Leptinob/ob mutation (Lepob). High-density genotypes. diabetes-related clinical traits. and whole-transcriptome expression profiling in five tissues (white adipose. liver. pancreatic islets. hypothalamus. and gastrocnemius muscle) were determined for all mice. We performed an integrative analysis to investigate the inter-relationship among genetic factors. expression traits. and plasma insulin. a hallmark diabetes trait. Among five tissues under study. there are extensive protein–protein interactions between genes responding to different loci in adipose and pancreatic islets that potentially jointly participated in the regulation of plasma insulin. We developed a novel ranking scheme based on cross-loci protein-protein network topology and gene expression to assess each gene's potential to regulate plasma insulin. Unique candidate genes were identified in adipose tissue and islets. In islets. the Alzheimer's gene App was identified as a top candidate regulator. Islets from 17-week-old. but not 10-week-old.

One reason for this is the overly simplistic view of the molecular mechanisms underlying common human diseases. This viewpoint is a consequence of biological reductionism. brought about by the need to form a basic understanding of the fundamental attributes of biological systems and by limitations in the set of tools available for analysis of biological systems. However. complex biological systems are best modeled as highly modular. fluid systems exhibiting a plasticity that allows them to adapt to a vast array of conditions.

Moreover. because each of these cases involves only one gene. we lack any understanding of how natural selection may act on cis-regulation across entire pathways or networks. Here we apply a genome-wide test for selection on cis-regulation to two subspecies of the mouse Mus musculus. We find evidence for lineage-specific selection at over 100 genes involved in diverse processes such as growth. locomotion. and memory. These gene sets implicate candidate genes that are supported by both quantitative trait loci and a validated causality-testing framework. and they predict a number of phenotypic differences. which we confirm in all four cases tested. Our results suggest that gene expression adaptation is widespread and that these adaptations can be highly polygenic. involving cis-regulatory changes at numerous functionally related genes.

Systematic comparison of these networks between species has the potential to elucidate common mechanisms that are conserved between human and rodent species. as well as those that are species-specific characterizing evolutionary plasticity. We developed a semi-parametric meta-analysis approach for combining gene-gene co-expression relationships across expression profile datasets from multiple species. The simulation results showed that the semi-parametric method is robust against noise. When applied to human. mouse. and rat liver co-expression networks. our method out-performed existing methods in identifying gene pairs with coherent biological functions. We identified a network conserved across species that highlighted cell-cell signaling. cell-adhesion and sterol biosynthesis as main biological processes represented in genome-wide association study candidate gene sets for blood lipid levels. We further developed a heterogeneity statistic to test for network differences among multiple datasets. and demonstrated that genes with species-specific interactions tend to be under positive selection throughout evolution.

Identification and annotation of the genomic sequence variants that cause gene expression changes is therefore likely to lead to a better understanding of the cause of disease at the molecular level. In this study we investigate the pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes for which the mRNA levels show cis-genetic linkage (gene e xpression q uantitative t rait l oci mapping in cis. or cis-eQTLs) in segregating mouse populations. Such genes are expected to have polymorphisms near their physical location (cis-variations) that affect their mRNA levels by altering one or more of the cis-regulatory elements. This led us to characterize the SNPs in promoter (5 Kb upstream) and non-coding gene regions (introns and 5 Kb downstream) (cis-SNPs) and the effects they may have on putative transcription factor binding sites. We demonstrate that the c is-e QTL genes (CEGs) have a significantly higher frequency of cis-SNPs compared to non-CEGs (when both sets are taken from the non-IBD regions. i.e. regions not identical by descent). Most CEGs having cis-SNPs do not contain these SNPs in the phylogenetically conserved regions. In those CEGs that contain cis-SNPs in the phylogenetically conserved regions. enrichment of cis-SNPs occurs both within and outside of the conserved sequences. A higher fraction of CEGs are also seen to harbor cis-SNP that affect predicted transcription factor binding sites. a likely consequence of the higher cis-SNPs density in these genes.

Single molecule. real time (SMRT) sequencing technology generates DNA sequences as well as DNA polymerase kinetic information that can be used for the direct detection of DNA modifications. We demonstrate that local sequence context has a strong impact on DNA polymerase kinetics in the neighborhood of the incorporation site during the DNA synthesis reaction. allowing for the possibility of estimating the expected kinetic rate of the enzyme at the incorporation site using kinetic rate information collected from existing SMRT sequencing data (historical data) covering the same local sequence contexts of interest. We develop an Empirical Bayesian hierarchical model for incorporating historical data. Our results show that the model could greatly increase DNA modification detection accuracy. and reduce requirement of control data coverage. For some DNA modifications that have a strong signal. a control sample is not even needed by using historical data as alternative to control. Thus. sequencing costs can be greatly reduced by using the model. We implemented the model in a R package named seqPatch. which is available at https://github.com/zhixingfeng/seqPatch.,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC,52,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002935,13611692597296635367,/scholar?cites=13611692597296635367,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002935,0,0,0
10097260,Inferring causal genomic alterations in breast cancer using gene expression data,2011,Linh M Tran and Bin Zhang and Zhan Zhang and Chunsheng Zhang and Tao Xie and John R Lamb and Hongyue Dai and Eric E Schadt and Jun Zhu,5,BMC systems biology,1,1-13,BioMed Central,One of the primary objectives in cancer research is to identify causal genomic alterations. such as somatic copy number variation (CNV) and somatic mutations. during tumor development. Many valuable studies lack genomic data to detect CNV; therefore. methods that are able to infer CNVs from gene expression data would help maximize the value of these studies. We developed a framework for identifying recurrent regions of CNV and distinguishing the cancer driver genes from the passenger genes in the regions. By inferring CNV regions across many datasets we were able to identify 109 recurrent amplified/deleted CNV regions. Many of these regions are enriched for genes involved in many important processes associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Genes in these recurrent CNV regions were then examined in the context of gene regulatory networks to prioritize putative cancer driver genes. The cancer driver genes uncovered by the framework include not only well-known oncogenes but also a number of novel cancer susceptibility genes validated via siRNA experiments. To our knowledge. this is the first effort to systematically identify and validate drivers for expression based CNV regions in breast cancer. The framework where the wavelet analysis of copy number alteration based on expression coupled with the gene regulatory network analysis. provides a blueprint for leveraging genomic data to identify key regulatory components and gene targets. This integrative approach can be applied to many other large-scale gene expression studies and other novel types of cancer data such as next-generation sequencing based …,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC,52,https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-5-121,8526917448745771957,/scholar?cites=8526917448745771957,,https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-5-121,0,0,0

The relationships between these two sets of predictive genes and the general process of tumorigenesis and disease progression remains unclear.   Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have investigated HCC tumorigenesis by comparing gene expression. DNA copy number variation and survival using ∼250 AN and TU samples representing. respectively. the pre-cancer state. and the result of tumorigenesis. Genes that participate in tumorigenesis were defined using a gene-gene correlation meta-analysis procedure that compared AN versus TU tissues. Genes predictive of survival in AN (AN-survival genes) were found to be enriched in the differential gene-gene correlation gene set indicating that they directly participate in the process of tumorigenesis. Additionally the AN-survival genes were mostly not predictive after tumorigenesis in TU tissue and this transition was associated with and could largely be explained by the effect of somatic DNA copy number variation (sCNV) in cis and in trans. The data was consistent with the variance of AN-survival genes being rate-limiting steps in tumorigenesis and this was confirmed using a treatment that promotes HCC tumorigenesis that selectively altered AN-survival genes and genes differentially correlated between AN and TU.   Conclusions/Significance This suggests that the process of tumor evolution involves rate-limiting steps related to the background from which the tumor evolved where these were frequently predictive of clinical outcome …,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC,51,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020090,10613469730228364006,/scholar?cites=10613469730228364006,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020090,0,0,0

We have identified a large number of trait QTLs including loci driving variation in cardiac function on chromosomes 2 and 6 and a hotspot for adiposity. energy metabolism. and glucose traits on chromosome 8. Integration of adipose gene expression data identified a core set of genes that drive the chromosome 8 adiposity QTL.

A systems biology approach was used to identify regulatory gene networks essential for primordial follicle development. Transcriptional responses to eight different growth factors known to influence primordial follicles were used to construct a bionetwork of regulatory genes involved in rat primordial follicle development. Over 1.500 genes were found to be regulated by the various growth factors and a network analysis identified critical gene modules involved in a number of signaling pathways and cellular processes. A set of 55 genes was identified as potential critical regulators of these gene modules. and a sub-network associated with development was determined. Within the network two previously identified regulatory genes were confirmed (i.e.. Pdgfa and Fgfr2) and a new factor was identified. connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). CTGF was tested in ovarian organ cultures and found to stimulate primordial follicle development.

10097273,Calibrating the performance of SNP arrays for whole-genome association studies,2008,Ke Hao and Eric E Schadt and John D Storey,4,PLoS Genet,6,e1000109,Public Library of Science,To facilitate whole-genome association studies (WGAS). several high-density SNP genotyping arrays have been developed. Genetic coverage and statistical power are the primary benchmark metrics in evaluating the performance of SNP arrays. Ideally. such evaluations would be done on a SNP set and a cohort of individuals that are both independently sampled from the original SNPs and individuals used in developing the arrays. Without utilization of an independent test set. previous estimates of genetic coverage and statistical power may be subject to an overfitting bias. Additionally. the SNP arrays' statistical power in WGAS has not been systematically assessed on real traits. One robust setting for doing so is to evaluate statistical power on thousands of traits measured from a single set of individuals. In this study. 359 newly sampled Americans of European descent were genotyped using both Affymetrix 500K (Affx500K) and Illumina 650Y (Ilmn650K) SNP arrays. From these data. we were able to obtain estimates of genetic coverage. which are robust to overfitting. by constructing an independent test set from among these genotypes and individuals. Furthermore. we collected liver tissue RNA from the participants and profiled these samples on a comprehensive gene expression microarray. The RNA levels were used as a large-scale set of quantitative traits to calibrate the relative statistical power of the commercial arrays. Our genetic coverage estimates are lower than previous reports. providing evidence that previous estimates may be inflated due to overfitting.

While genome-wide association studies in humans and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses in mice have identified candidate genes for an increasing number of complex traits and genetic diseases. the resources and time-consuming process necessary for obtaining detailed quantitative data have made sleep seemingly intractable to similar large-scale genomic approaches. Here we describe analysis of 20 sleep-wake traits from 269 mice from a genetically segregating population that reveals 52 significant QTL representing a minimum of 20 genomic loci. While many (28) QTL affected a particular sleep-wake trait (e.g.. amount of wake) across the full 24-hr day. other loci only affected a trait in the light or dark period while some loci had opposite effects on the trait during the light vs. dark. Analysis of a dataset for multiple sleep-wake traits led to previously undetected interactions (including the differential genetic control of number and duration of REM bouts). as well as possible shared genetic regulatory mechanisms for seemingly different unrelated sleep-wake traits (e.g.. number of arousals and REM latency). Construction of a Bayesian network for sleep-wake traits and loci led to the identification of sub-networks of linkage not detectable in smaller data sets or limited single-trait analyses.

Here we show the overexpression of miRNAs 132 and 212 enhances insulin secretion (IS) in response to glucose and other secretagogues including nonfuel stimuli. We determined that carnitine acyl-carnitine translocase (CACT; Slc25a20) is a direct target of these miRNAs. CACT is responsible for transporting long-chain acyl-carnitines into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. Small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown of CACT in β-cells led to the accumulation of fatty acyl-carnitines and enhanced IS.

To identify genes. pathways and cell types driving MIS-C. we sequenced the blood transcriptomes of MIS-C cases. pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019. and healthy controls. We define a MIS-C transcriptional signature partially shared with the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and with the signature of Kawasaki disease. a clinically similar condition. By projecting the MIS-C signature onto a co-expression network. we identified disease gene modules and found genes downregulated in MIS-C clustered in a module enriched for the transcriptional signatures of exhausted CD8+ T-cells and CD56dimCD57+ NK cells.

We integrated the analysis of genetic and clinical data from 10.511 individuals in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biobank to identify genes with loss-of-function variants (LoFs) significantly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) traits. and used RNA-sequence data of seven metabolic and vascular tissues isolated from 600 CVD patients in the Stockholm-Tartu Atherosclerosis Reverse Network Engineering Task (STARNET) study for validation. We also carried out in vitro functional studies of several candidate genes. and in vivo studies of one gene. We identified LoFs in 433 genes significantly associated with at least one of 10 major CVD traits. Next. we used RNA-sequence data from the STARNET study to validate 115 of the 433 LoF harboring-genes in that their expression levels were concordantly associated with corresponding CVD traits. Together with the documented hepatic lipid-lowering gene. APOC3. the expression levels of six additional liver LoF-genes were positively associated with levels of plasma lipids in STARNET. Candidate LoF-genes were subjected to gene silencing in HepG2 cells with marked overall effects on cellular LDLR. levels of triglycerides and on secreted APOB100 and PCSK9.

Methods: This is a single-arm. open label. proof-of-concept phase I study designed to test the safety and immunogenicity of Personalized Genomic Vaccine 001 (PGV001) that targets up to 10 predicted personal tumor neoantigens based on patient’s HLA profile (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02721043). Results: Patients who completed vaccination with PGV001_002 (head and neck squamous cell cancer) received 10 doses of vaccine comprising 10 long peptides (LP) combined with poly-ICLC (toll-like receptor-3 agonist) intradermally.

Although genome wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered new loci associated with T2D. their contribution to explain the mechanisms leading to decreased insulin sensitivity has been very limited. Thus. new approaches are necessary to explore the genetic architecture of insulin resistance. To that end. we generated an iPSC library across the spectrum of insulin sensitivity in humans. RNA-seq based analysis of 310 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones derived from 100 individuals allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes between insulin resistant and sensitive iPSC lines. Analysis of the co-expression architecture uncovered several insulin sensitivity-relevant gene sub-networks. and predictive network modeling identified a set of key driver genes that regulate these co-expression modules. Functional validation in human adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells (SKMCs) confirmed the relevance of the key driver candidate genes for insulin responsiveness.,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:gkldIfsazJcC,0,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008491,,,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008491,0,0,0

Here. we seek to delineate sex differences in the expression of entry genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2. host responses to SARS-CoV-2. and in vitro responses to sex steroid hormone treatment. Using over 220.000 human gene expression pro les covering a wide range of age. tissues. and diseases. we found that male samples show higher expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. especially in the older group (> 60 years) and in the kidney. Analysis of 6.031 COVID-19 patients at Mount Sinai Health System revealed that men have signi cantly higher creatinine levels. an indicator of impaired kidney function. Further analysis of 782 COVID-19 patient gene expression pro les taken from upper airway and blood suggested men and women present profound expression differences in responses to SARS-CoV-2. Computational deconvolution analysis of these pro les revealed male COVID-19 patients have enriched kidney-speci c mesangial cells in blood compared to healthy patients. Finally. we observed selective estrogen receptor modulators. but not other hormone drugs (agonists/antagonists of estrogen. androgen. and progesterone). could reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:yKzB5RS27GgC,0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-100914/latest.pdf,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-100914/latest.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we compare deep DNA methylome sequencing on 19 human insulinomas. and five sets of normal beta cells. We find a remarkably consistent. abnormal methylation pattern in insulinomas.

Despite significant progress made in elucidating mechanisms of tumor initiation and progression. targeted therapies have shown limited efficacy for inoperable or metastatic CRC tumors. especially KRAS or BRAF mutant tumors. which account for more than half (~55%) of CRC tumors. Several targeted inhibitors have failed clinical trials for CRC despite proving effective in preclinical CRC studies and other cancer types. A potential reason for this resistance is the presence of several other mutations in the tumors.

Detecting and phasing minor variants. which is to determine whether multiple variants are from the same haplotype. play an instrumental role in deciphering cellular genetic heterogeneity. but are still difficult because of technological limitations. Recently. long-read sequencing technologies. including those by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore. have provided an unprecedented opportunity to tackle these challenges.

To fill this gap. we introduce iGDA. an open-source tool that can accurately detect and phase minor single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). whose frequencies are as low as 0.2%. from raw long-read sequencing data. We also demonstrated that iGDA can accurately reconstruct haplotypes in closely-related strains of the same species (divergence ≥ 0.011%) from long-read metagenomic data.

We pursued an unbiased systems biology approach using bulk RNA sequencing data to examine pre-treatment molecular features associated with sensitivity to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer and identified an adaptive_immune_response module associated with response and an inflammatory_response module and stromal module associated with resistance. We mapped these gene modules onto single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrating the adaptive_immune_response module emanated predominantly from T.

Genetic susceptibility factors indicate that myeloid cells such as microglia play a significant role in the onset of LOAD. Here. we developed a computational systems biology approach to construct probabilistic causal and predictive network models of genetic regulatory programs of microglial cells under LOAD diagnosis by integrating two independent brain transcriptome and genome-wide genotype datasets from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and Mayo Clinic (MAYO) studies in the AMPAD consortium. From this network model. we identified and replicated novel microglialspecific master regulators predicted to modulate network states associated with LOAD. We experimentally validated three microglial master regulators (FCER1G. HCK and LAPTM5) in primary human microglia-like cells (MDMi) by demonstrating the molecular impact these master regulators have on modulating downstream genomic targets identified by our top-down/bottom-up method and the causal relations among the three key drivers. These master regulators are involved in phagocytosis. a process associated with LOAD. Thus. we propose three new master regulator (key driver) genes that emerged from our network analyses as robust candidates for further evaluation in LOAD therapeutic development efforts.,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:BFa5h04uPMwC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.143529v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/10/2020.06.09.143529.full.pdf,0,0,0

Genomic regulatory regions are enriched for variants implicated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). suggesting that risk is at least in part conferred through genetic control of gene expression. As a result. studies of the genetic architecture of gene expression in the human brain are essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying polygenicity. To date. such studies have been underpowered. Here. we will combine publicly available datasets with a large new dataset for a total sample size of 4.157 individuals.

This is because the inaccessibility of the brain in living patients has historically rendered it difficult to pair the two tissues for comparison. The Living Brain Project (LBP) is a novel framework for human brain research that seeks to overcome this barrier by pairing biopsies of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with samples of venous blood in a large cohort of neuropsychiatric patients. We will present the motivation and design of the LBP. Then. using both this new resource and publicly available data. we will present evidence that the state of the transcriptome in the DLPFC can be imputed from that of the blood.Methods: As part of the LBP. paired sampling of the DLPFC and blood was performed during 236 deep brain stimulation electrode implantation procedures (126 left hemisphere …,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:HKviVsUxM5wC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4378085855727882272&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Occasionally in clinical embryo culture we see nonviable blastocysts with morphology of few or no inner cell mass (ICM) cells and good quality TE cells. Also the reverse is seen. a blastocyst with good quality ICM but few elongated TEs. These embryos are not suitable for biopsy or clinical use. However. these morphologically abnormal blastocysts provide a novel glimpse at the very earliest stages of human cell differentiation.

To develop a more comprehensive understanding of acne pathophysiology. we conducted an in-depth multi-omic study of 56 acne patients and 20 individuals without acne. We collected whole blood. skin punch biopsies. microbiota from skin follicles. and relevant clinical measurements to understand how multiple factors contribute to acne. We provide an integrative analysis of multi-omics data that results in a molecular network of acne. Comparisons of lesional and non-lesional skin highlighted multiple biological processes. including immune cell and inflammatory responses. response to stress. T cell activation. lipid biosynthesis. fatty acid metabolism. keratinocytes. antimicrobial activity. epithelial cell differentiation. and response to wounding. that are differentially altered in acne lesions compared to non-lesions. Our results suggest baseline differences in the skin that may predispose individuals to develop acne. These datasets and findings offer a framework for new target identification and reference for future studies.,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:MGPUR4WVBMEC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/587857v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/03/25/587857.full.pdf,0,0,0

Research suggests a higher incidence of mosaicism in day 3 embryos. suggesting that embryos with complex mitotic-derived aneuploidy are more likely to arrest 1. Mosaicism may have been previously overestimated in cleavage stage embryos due to technical limitations (ie FISH on single blastomeres). Few studies have evaluated mosaicism throughout embryo development. using NGS-which allows for high resolution copy number variant (CNV) analysis.

10097597,NETWORK METHODS FOR ELUCIDATING THE COMPLEXITY OF COMMON HUMAN DISEASES,2017,Eric E Schadt,,Charney & Nestler's Neurobiology of Mental Illness,,17,Oxford University Press,Our understandings of common human diseases and how best to treat them are hampered by the complexity of the human system in which they are manifested. Unlike simple Mendelian disorders in which highly expressive. highly penetrant mutations make it possible to identify the causal genes within families segregating traits associated with the disorders. the common human diseases originate from a more complex interplay between constellations of changes in DNA (both rare and common variations) and a broad range of environmental factors like diet. age. sex. and exposure to environmental toxins (R. Chen et al.. 2016). With roughly 3 billion nucleotides making up the human genome. the number of nucleotide changes that can affect the activities of a moderate to large number of genes vastly exceeds our ability to experimentally determine the effects of combinations of such changes. Whereas the focus in years past regarding DNA variation and its association to disease had been focused on protein-coding sequences. given declarations of intergenic DNA being composed mainly of “junk”(Smith. Brookhaven National Laboratory et al.. 1972) we know today that more than 80% of the human genome is actively bound by proteins that regulate the expression of genes (Ecker et al.. 2012). providing a vast array of knobs and switches to modulate not only the activity of genes but also the activity of whole gene networks. Therefore. leveraging naturally occurring DNA variation in human populations can be considered among the most attractive approaches to inferring the constellation of genes that affect disease risk.

It is widely hypothesized that this association between mutations and survival is a result of neo-epitopes that induce a robust anti-tumor immune response. Naively this implies that patient neo-epitope burden should better predict survival than that of mutations alone. however this has generally been difficult to prove. Indeed. mutations and predicted neo-epitopes explain roughly the same survival variance. likely due to the intertwined difficulties of neo-epitope prioritization and the often immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment.Reasoning that integrating leading order immune response with novel neo-epitope prioritization will lead to superior performance. we built a statistical model to quantify the influence …,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:4Yq6kJLCcecC,0,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/13_Supplement/1653.short,,,,,0,0,0

Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3). an extensively-studied histone modification. is known to mark the transcription start sites (TSS) of active gene promoters. Typical H3K4me3 is usually confined to a punctate interval of 1-2 kb pairs with high signal density around the TSS. Regulators of H3K4me3 mark are significantly associated with the genetic risk architecture of common neurodevelopmental disease. including schizophrenia and autism. However. there is very little information on the importance of the breadth of an H3K4me3 enrichment locus in normal and diseased human brain.MethodsHere. through integrative computational analysis of epigenomic and transcriptomic data based on next generation sequencing. we investigated. at base pair resolution on a genome-wide scale.

RNA sequencing was used to profile the transcriptomes of serial peripheral blood samples drawn from each subject at baseline. two hours. and four hours following the initiation of peanut and placebo challenges. The RNA sequence data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). key driver analysis. causal inference testing (CIT). and leukocyte deconvolution.RESULTS: We identified 123 peanut response genes (FDR 10%) with significant changes in gene expression triggered by peanut but not placebo during the acute allergic response. Among these genes. gene expression changed most between baseline and four hours following peanut. To ascertain the biological context for these genes. we performed WGCNA and identified a specific coexpression module encompassing several proinflammatory pathways enriched for peanut response genes.

We generated and analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 17 patients to identify somatic and germline genetic alterations. A panel of selected genes was sequenced in a 7-tumor expansion cohort. We show that 47% (8 of 17) of the tumors harbor somatic mutations in the CDC73 tumor suppressor. with germline inactivating variants in 4 of the 8 patients. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was altered in 21% of the 24 cases. revealing a major oncogenic pathway in PC. We observed CCND1 amplification in 29% of the 17 patients. and a previously unreported recurrent mutation in putative kinase ADCK1. We identified the first sporadic PCs with somatic mutations in the Wnt canonical pathway. complementing previously described epigenetic mechanisms mediating Wnt activation.

It is widely hypothesized that this association between mutations and survival is a result of mutations leading to neo-epitopes which in turn induce a robust anti-tumor immune response. It follows that accurately quantifying the number of neo-epitopes within a patient should better predict survival than that of non-synonymous mutations. however that has generally not been the case. Indeed. mutations and predicted neo-epitopes explain roughly the same survival variance. likely due to the difficulty of accurately predicting and prioritizing immunogenic neo-epitopes from mutations. We hypothesized that by integrating several data types and using state-of-the-art techniques for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II allele calling and epitope binding prediction …,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:-6RzNnnwWf8C,0,https://cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org/content/4/11_Supplement/A024.abstract,,,,,0,0,0

This atherosclerosis module was enriched with inherited risk for coronary and carotid artery disease (CAD) and overlapped with genes in the transendothelial migration of leukocyte (TEML) pathway. Among the atherosclerosis module genes. the transcription cofactor Lim domain binding 2 (LDB2) was the most connected in a CAD vascular wall regulatory gene network. Here. we used human genomics and atherosclerosis-prone mice to evaluate the possible role of LDB2 in TEML and atherosclerosis.Approach and Results—mRNA profiles generated from blood macrophages in patients with CAD were used to infer transcription factor regulatory gene networks; Ldlr–/–Apob100/100 mice were used to study the effects of Ldb2 deficiency on TEML activity and atherogenesis. LDB2 was the most connected gene in a transcription factor regulatory network inferred from TEML and atherosclerosis module genes in CAD macrophages. In Ldlr–/–Apob100/100 mice. loss of Ldb2 increased atherosclerotic lesion size≈ 2-fold and decreased plaque stability. The exacerbated atherosclerosis was caused by increased TEML activity. as demonstrated in air-pouch and retinal vasculature models in vivo. by ex vivo perfusion of primary leukocytes. and by leukocyte migration in vitro. In THP1 cells. migration was increased by overexpression and decreased by small interfering RNA inhibition of LDB2. A functional LDB2 variant (rs10939673) was associated with the risk and extent of CAD across several cohorts …,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:yCjxvIMm6_oC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5142052806932986663&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Translational studies of clinically active targeted therapeutics can definitively discriminate driver from passenger lesions and provide valuable insights into human cancer biology. Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) are detected in approximately 20% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis. Abundant scientific and clinical evidence. including the lack of convincing clinical activity of early FLT3 inhibitors. suggests that FLT3-ITD probably represents a passenger lesion. Here we report point mutations at three residues within the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD that confer substantial in vitro resistance to AC220 (quizartinib). an active investigational inhibitor of FLT3. KIT. PDGFRA. PDGFRB and RET; evolution of AC220-resistant substitutions at two of these amino acid positions was observed in eight of eight FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients with acquired resistance to AC220. Our findings demonstrate that FLT3-ITD can represent a driver lesion and valid therapeutic target in human AML. AC220-resistant FLT3 kinase domain mutants represent high-value targets for future FLT3 inhibitor development efforts.,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:1wZ_wKGpLuwC,0,https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/price-of-freedom,,,,,0,0,0

10097653,Inferring causal genomic alterations in breast cancer using gene expression data,2011,Jun Zhu and Eric E Schadt and Hongyue Dai and John R Lamb and Tao Xie and Chunsheng Zhang and Zhan Zhang and Bin Zhang and Linh M Tran,,,,,,BackgroundOne of the primary objectives in cancer research is to identify causal genomic alterations. such as somatic copy number variation (CNV) and somatic mutations. during tumor development. Many valuable studies lack genomic data to detect CNV; therefore. methods that are able to infer CNVs from gene expression data would help maximize the value of these studies.ResultsWe developed a framework for identifying recurrent regions of CNV and distinguishing the cancer driver genes from the passenger genes in the regions. By inferring CNV regions across many datasets we were able to identify 109 recurrent amplified/deleted CNV regions. Many of these regions are enriched for genes involved in many important processes associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Genes in these recurrent CNV regions were then examined in the context of gene regulatory networks to prioritize putative cancer driver genes. The cancer driver genes uncovered by the framework include not only well-known oncogenes but also a number of novel cancer susceptibility genes validated via siRNA experiments.ConclusionsTo our knowledge. this is the first effort to systematically identify and validate drivers for expression based CNV regions in breast cancer. The framework where the wavelet analysis of copy number alteration based on expression coupled with the gene regulatory network analysis. provides a blueprint for leveraging genomic data to identify key regulatory components and gene targets.

It is critical to identify cancer specific target genes so that only cancer cells can be killed while non-cancer cells remain unaffected. Based on a recent published whole genome RNAi screen on both cancer and non-cancer cells. we compared cancer cell lethal genes vs. normal cell lethal genes in a cross-species manner with C. elegans. We found that common lethal genes shared by normal and cancer cells were enriched in certain essential functions. such as ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process. cell cycle. and metabolic processes. while cancer cell only lethal genes were either enriched of aforementioned functions or with no apparent enriched function.

Systematic comparison of these networks between species has the potential to elucidate common mechanisms that are conserved between human and rodent species. as well as those that are species-specific characterizing evolutionary plasticity. We developed a semiparametric meta-analysis approach for combining gene-gene co-expression relationships across expression profile datasets from multiple species. The simulation results showed that the semi-parametric method is robust against noise. When applied to human. mouse. and rat liver co-expression networks. our method out-performed existing methods in identifying gene pairs with coherent biological functions. We identified a network conserved across species that highlighted cell-cell signaling. cell-adhesion and sterol biosynthesis as main biological processes represented in genome-wide association study candidate gene sets for blood lipid levels. We further developed a heterogeneity statistic to test for network differences among multiple datasets. and demonstrated that genes with species-specific interactions tend to be under positive selection throughout evolution. Finally. we identified a human-specific sub-network regulated by RXRG. which has been validated to play a different role in hyperlipidemia and Type 2 diabetes between human and mouse.

Since HDL levels are highly heritable. with heritability estimated at 50–70% in many studies. there are clearly many additional genes. and probably complex genetic and environmental interactions. involved in HDL metabolism. Thus. if “personalized medicine” is to become a reality. these complex factors must be addressed. Combined genetic-genomic approaches have rejuvenated the analysis of complex traits using mouse models. and here report an integrative genomic study of HDL in a large mouse cross. We previously reported the identification of loci associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations using a CXB F2 intercross.

B6 and BTBR mice differ in obesity-induced diabetes susceptibility. The B6 strain is essentially nondiabetic when it carries the leptinob/ob (ob) mutation. whereas. by 10 wk of age. the BTBR ob mouse is severely diabetic (Fig. 1B). Since the BTBR ob mouse is not yet diabetic at 4 wk of age. changes in gene expression at this time are potential causes rather than consequences of hyperglycemia. The ability of the B6 mouse to maintain euglycemia when challenged with morbid obesity is due to a> 50-fold increase in circulating insulin at 10 wk of age (Fig. 1C). This contrasts with the relative hypoinsulinemia of the 10-wk-old BTBR ob mouse. The difference in insulin at 10 wk of age is correlated with the number of islets harvested from the pancreas (Fig. 1D). suggesting that the ability to continue compensating for insulin resistance is a function of the ability to continue expanding beta-cell mass. We observed significant differences between B6 and BTBR mice in circulating adipose-derived hormones (adipokines). Adiponectin has been shown to regulate peripheral insulin sensitivity. There was a∼ 50% decrease in circulating adiponectin in BTBR mice relative to B6 mice. irrespective of age and obesity (Fig. 1E). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). a bio-marker for inflammation. showed an obesity-dependent increase at 4 and 10 wk only in BTBR mice (Fig. 1F).

Unlike most other cancers. owing to a number of factors. the incidence of endometrial cancer and its associated mortality are increasing. with it projected to surpass colorectal cancer to become the third-leading cancer site among US women by 2030. 1 In addition. recent data from the CDC show that black women are twice as likely as white women to die from this cancer and that this may be due to later diagnosis. 2 Currently. there is no effective method for screening women in the general population for early signs of endometrial cancer.We hypothesized that uterine lavage fluid could provide a novel substrate for detecting mutations associated with endometrial cancer and precancer.

Embryo selection in the modern IVF laboratory is based on morphological criteria and chromosomal copy number assessment by preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-A). Despite our ability to enhance transfer selection and boost pregnancy outcomes using PGT-A. certain embryos do not develop to the blastocyst stage and up to a third of transferred euploid embryos fail to implant. suggesting there may be a variety of stresses and conditions. other than aneuploidy. that impede embryo development. Understanding key molecular pathways that mediate embryonic competence leveraging gene expression profiling could serve as one of the staples for the next generation of embryo quality testing.

Because of the large number of genes and genetic markers in such analyses. it is extremely challenging to discover how a small number of eQTLs interact with each other to affect mRNA expression levels for a set of (most likely coregulated) genes. We present a Bayesian method to facilitate the task. in which co-expressed genes mapped to a common set of markers are treated as a module characterized by latent indicator variables. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is designed to search simultaneously for the module genes and their linked markers. We show by simulations that this method is much more powerful for detecting true eQTLs and their target genes than …,True,s18-KHUAAAAJ:n3vGvpFsckwC,0,http://math.mit.edu/compbiosem/spring09/Jin_liu_Harvard.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

De novo assembly of these single molecules yields high-fidelity contiguous map information across long ranges. Its advantage over all other genome assembly methods is particularly dramatic in highly repetitive regions. Genome maps thus greatly complement assemblies using relatively short second-and third-generation sequencing reads. We have constructed genome maps of human NA12878 (cell line derived from the daughter in the CEU trio) which resulted in a consensus assembly measuring 2.9 Gb and with an N50 of 4.6 Mb. With Pacific Biosciences sequence from the same cell line. we also created a sequence-based assembly with N50 length of 930 kb in parallel. By combining data from these two technologies with a custom-designed hybrid scaffolding pipeline. we were able to generate an assembly having scaffold N50 length of greater than 30 Mb covering more than 2.7 Gb of the human genome. At the same time. we were able to identify potential misassembles in the sequence assembly as well as in the genome maps by reviewing the inconsistencies between these two complementary technologies.

To address the issue of sampling bias towards positive cases in the training data. we applied the adjustment with τ= 0.00046. For each target gene. we shortlisted the top p= 100 candidate regulators with the highest regulatory potentials. We then applied iBMA-‐prior to the time-‐series gene expression data. At each run of BMA. a window size of w= 30 was maintained. and the best nbest= 10 models as per each model size were returned from leaps and bounds. At the end of iBMA. the Occam’s window was applied to discard models with posterior odds of less than 1/20 against the best model (ie. the one with the highest posterior probability). Out of the p= 100 candidates. we inferred those with a posterior inclusion probability≥ 50% to be regulators of the target gene. We adopted the same values of parameters from previous applications of BMA[2-‐5]. We used the above strategy to infer regulators for each of the 3556 genes in the data set.

Figure S1 summarizes the sample pairings for the two-color hybridizations. Each connecting line segment represents a pair of arrays where each array is hybridized with the two samples but the assignment of fluorescent labels is reversed. This fluor reversal strategy allows removal of most of the biases caused by dye-specific interactions during the process. Each fluor-reversed-pair (FRP) of arrays in which the samples in Cy3 and Cy5 were non-identical was repeated to provide the redundancy crucial to the proposed Type 2 figure of merit evaluation method. Thus each connector in Figure S1 actually represents four microarray hybridization experiments. The overall experiment design can be thought of as a ring with spokes and chords.

The new formulation is based on the introduction of average values in the unperturbed state of excitation operators which bear resemblance with analogous ones occurring in the extended Koopmans’ theorem and in the equations-of-motion technique. Such auxiliary quantities. which allow the second-order perturbation contribution to the energy to be evaluated very efficiently. can be calculated at the outset provided the unperturbed four-particle spinless density matrix in the active orbital space is available.

We develop a formalism in which the key quantities used for the second-order perturbation correction to the energy are written in terms of the matrix elements of suitable operators evaluated on the zero-order wavefunction. without the explicit knowledge of the perturbation functions. The new formalism strongly improves the computation performances.

Even when optimal or optimization-based control synthesis tools are applied. the economic cost associated with plant operation is often only optimized according to static criteria that pick. among all feasible steady states. those with minimal cost. In mathematical terms. an economic cost functional differs from stage costs commonly adopted in model predictive control (MPC) as it need not be minimal at its best equilibrium. This note collects and illustrates some recent advances in receding horizon optimization of nonlinear systems that allow the control designer to simultaneously and dynamically optimize transient and steady-state economic performance.

The device is based on a T configuration and gases of different viscosities are employed. Simulations show that the mixing length increases with the fluid speed and is also influenced by the mixer aspect ratio. Altering the angle between the inlet channels does not significantly affect the mixing performance. whilst throttling the fluid considerably decreases the mixing length. The results are compared with Fourier number predictions and it is demonstrated that these can provide useful limits for a preliminary design.,True,2xCJUiEAAAAJ:41b8sTJFDYwC,394,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0960-1317/11/2/307/meta,14254879750610639141,/scholar?cites=14254879750610639141,,,0,0,0

The slowdown of the aqueous glass corrosion kinetics that is frequently observed at long time is generally attributed to chemical affinity effects (saturation of the solution with respect to silica). Here. we demonstrate a new mechanism and highlight the impact of morphological transformations in the alteration layer on the leaching kinetics. A direct correlation between structure and reactivity is revealed by coupling the results of several structure-sensitive experiments with numerical simulations at mesoscopic scale. The sharp drop in the corrosion rate is shown to arise from densification of the outer layers of the alteration film. leading to pore closure. The presence of insoluble elements in the glass can inhibit the film restructuring responsible for this effect.

It has given rise to hundreds of pathophysiological studies in experimental and human cirrhosis and is the theoretical basis of life-saving treatments. It is undisputed that splanchnic arterial vasodilation contributes to portal hypertension and is the basis for manifestations such as ascites and hepatorenal syndrome. but the body of research generated by the hypothesis has revealed gaps in the original pathophysiological interpretation of these complications.

Partially single-stranded replication intermediates detected in the same DNA preparations were assumed to derive from the previously described. strand-asymmetric mode of mitochondrial DNA replication. Here. we show that bona fide replication intermediates from highly purified mitochondria are essentially duplex throughout their length. but contain widespread regions of RNA:DNA hybrid. as a result of the incorporation of ribonucleotides on the light strand which are subsequently converted to DNA. Ribonucleotide-rich regions can be degraded to generate partially single-stranded molecules by RNase H treatment in vitro or during DNA extraction from crude mitochondria.

Using a model of sensitization. based on the intratracheal transfer of ovalbumin (OVA)-pulsed DCs. we show that rosiglitazone. a selective PPAR-γ agonist. reduces the proliferation of Ag-specific T cells in the draining mediastinal lymph nodes but. surprisingly enough. dramatically increases the production of the immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 …,True,2xCJUiEAAAAJ:qt-6tCTBDsQC,202,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944010631161,7959422469755022381,/scholar?cites=7959422469755022381,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1602239/,0,0,0

Addressing this question requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underpinning aqueous corrosion of these materials. Here we show that in silica-saturated solution. a model glass of nuclear interest corrodes but at a rate that dramatically drops as a passivating layer forms. Water ingress into the glass. leading to the congruent release of mobile elements (B. Na and Ca). is followed by in situ repolymerization of the silicate network. This material is at equilibrium with pore and bulk solutions. and acts as a molecular sieve with a cutoff below 1 nm.

Despite appropriate therapy. acute OM (AOM) can progress to chronic suppurative OM (CSOM) associated with ear drum perforation and purulent discharge. The effusion prevents the middle ear ossicles from properly relaying sound vibrations from the ear drum to the oval window of the inner ear. causing conductive hearing loss. In addition. the inflammatory mediators generated during CSOM can penetrate into the inner ear through the round window. This can cause the loss of hair cells in the cochlea. leading to sensorineural hearing loss. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are the most predominant pathogens that cause CSOM. Although the pathogenesis of AOM is well studied. very limited research is available in relation to CSOM.

In this article a new physical effect is described. ie the spatial contraction of the π and π∗ molecular orbitals (or of the local p atomic orbitals) originated from the reduction of the ionicity due to the dynamic σ polarization. Such an effect is a second-order effect (it appears only as a consequence of the dynamic σ polarization) but it cannot be ignored.

This effect can be related to the first coordination shell of calcium (through the Ca–O bond distance) which is affected by the chemical environment beyond the first neighbors of calcium.,True,2xCJUiEAAAAJ:MDQ-9Oe3GGUC,93,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261407004848,8100844971004690737,/scholar?cites=8100844971004690737,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederic-Angeli/publication/230885742_Contribution_of_Ca-43_MAS_NMR_for_Probing_the_Structural_Configuration_of_Calcium_in_Glass/links/5bd017a54585152b1451168f/Contribution-of-Ca-43-MAS-NMR-for-Probing-the-Structural-Configuration-of-Calcium-in-Glass.pdf,0,0,0

Moreover. it analyzes the impact of the response to pharmacological treatment on the MELD score. its possible delaying effect on the timing of LT. and suggests a way of overcoming the paradoxical effect of terlipressin and albumin on the priority to LT in responders.Finally. the review discusses the appropriate use of combined liver–kidney transplantation (CLKT) in patients with HRS who do not respond to treatment with terlipressin and albumin.,True,2xCJUiEAAAAJ:pS0ncopqnHgC,88,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827812005090,2859148486520899138,/scholar?cites=2859148486520899138,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827812005090,0,0,0

Subsequent ciinical evidence documented an association between MAU and other cardiovascular risk factors. target organ damage and risk of cardiovascular disease in the genera1 population and in specific clinical contexts including essential hypertension. This article reviews the available evidence on the clinical value of MAU in subjects with essential hypertension. In these subjects. the reported prevalence of MAU ranges from about 4% to 46% across different studies and these differences may be explained by the huge intraindividual variability in UAE. age and ethnicity. discrepancies in the technique of measurement and different definitions of MAU. A direct and continuous association between UAE and blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass has been found in most studies. In contrast. it is not yet clear whether the association between UAE and other factors including age. gender. smoking. ethnicity. insulin resistance. lipids and obesity is independent or due to confounders. particularly BP. Severa1 prospettive studies disclosed an association between MAU and the risk of future cardiovascular disease. Of particular note. in some of these studies the incidence of major cardiovascular events progressively increased with UAE starting below the conventional MAU thresholds. Thus. besides being a direct risk factor for progressive renal damage.

In particular. we first investigate whether this dissipativity property is not only sufficient. but also necessary for optimal steady-state operation. In the most general case. this is not true; nevertheless. under an additional controllability assumption. we show that dissipativity is in fact necessary.

Theoretically a model was developed based on Kelvin–Helmholtz instability to predict the critical wave amplitude at which the waves become unstable for a specific wavelength. According to the model. waves become unstable in stratified flow when at a particular wavelength they exceed a critical amplitude. which decreases with increasing wavelength until it acquires an almost constant value. The model predictions showed that for low-viscosity oils the maximum critical amplitude appears at slip velocity close to zero. while for high-viscosity oils. the maximum amplitude appears for water velocity higher than that of the oil.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The performance of multiconfigurational second‐order perturbation techniques is established for the calculation of small magnetic couplings in heterobinuclear complexes. Whereas CASPT2 gives satisfactory results for relatively strong magnetic couplings. the method shows important deviations from the expected Heisenberg spectrum for couplings smaller than 15–20 cm−1. The standard choice of the zeroth‐order CASPT2 Hamiltonian is compared to alternative definitions published in the literature and the stability of the results is tested against increasing level shifts. Furthermore. we compare CASPT2 with an alternative implementation of multiconfigurational perturbation theory. namely NEVPT2 and with variational calculations based on the difference dedicated CI technique. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals.

Recent changes in terminology have led to acute HRS being referred to as acute kidney injury (AKI)-HRS and chronic HRS as chronic kidney disease (CKD)-HRS. AKI-HRS is characterized by a severe impairment of kidney function owing to vasoconstriction of the renal arteries in the absence of substantial abnormalities in kidney histology. Pathogenetic mechanisms involve disturbances in circulatory function due to a marked splanchnic arterial vasodilation. which triggers the activation of vasoconstrictor factors.

Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK or TPACK) was introduced to the educational research community as a framework for technology integration. as well as a body of knowledge of what teachers need to know to teach with technology (Angeli & Valanides. 2005; Koehler & Mishra. 2005; Niess. 2005). During the last decade. TPCK has received great attention from the research community. and. as a result. a considerable number of relevant articles appeared in the literature (Voogt. Fisser. Pareja Roblin. Tondeur. & van Braak. 2013).It is imperative to mention that up until 2005. research on teacher technology integration was mainly atheoretical in nature. However. the gradual integration of technology in classroom practices created a need for the development of theoretical models to guide teachers’ cognition about technology integration.

First. given a general time-varying terminal weight. we derive an upper bound on the closed-loop average performance which depends on the limit value of the predicted terminal state. After that. we derive conditions for a self-tuning terminal weight such that bounds for this limit value can be obtained. Finally. we propose several update rules for the self-tuning terminal weight and analyze their respective properties.

Since glucocorticoids are widely used for a variety of diseases. the prevalence of SAI is by far exceeding that of primary adrenal insufficiency. Although the presentation of adrenal insufficiency may be insidious and difficult to recognize. an appropriate adrenocortical hormone replacement could lead to a normal quality of life and longevity can be achieved. The spectrum of adrenal insufficiency ranges from overt adrenal crises to subtle dysfunctions in asymptomatic patients who may be at risk of developing acute adrenal insufficiency since their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis cannot appropriately react to stress.

These preservice teachers conversed electronically with peers. mentors. and instructors on the Web about cases related to their early field experiences using an asynchronous conferencing tool called Conferencing on the Web (COW). Whereas earlier research compared levels of scaffolding on student generation and discussion of cases in COW within specific time periods. this particular study allowed longer amounts of time for students to post and discuss cases. In addition. there was more qualitative data collected here than in the previous study. The 157 student participants in this study produced 319 cases during the conference with 620 peer replies and 298 mentor replies. Students submitted the majority of their cases to the secondary-school conference. while less than ten percent of the cases were submitted to the general-case conference. In effect. they failed to perceive the generalizability of their field experiences. Students received on average about three peer or mentor comments on their cases. Transcript analyses from 75 randomly selected cases indicated that students failed to justify most of their comments. In addition. peer feedback was extremely conversational and opinionated.

The prognostic impact of white-coat hypertension is a subject of debate. Cardiovascular morbidity seems to be lower in white-coat hypertension than in ambulatory hypertension. and. according to some but not all studies. is not dissimilar between white-coat hypertension and clinical normotension.

Selection of the zero-order space,1997,Celestino Angeli and Maurizio Persico,98,Theoretical Chemistry Accounts,2,117-128,Springer-Verlag, In this paper. the second of a series devoted to multi-reference perturbation CI. we tackle the problem of the appropriate selection of the zero-order space in CIPSI calculations. We propose a new selection procedure. explicitly devised in order to obtain a balanced description for different electronic states and nuclear geometries. To this aim. we define numerically the quality of the zero-order space by means of a suitable parameter σ. which is the square norm of the perturbative correction of the wavefunction. The zero-order space is expanded stepwise so as to obtain the same target σ for all states and geometries. This strategy is applied to the calculation of dissociation. activation and transition energies. It yields a much better convergence of perturbative and zero-order results. when compared with the selection procedure previously used.,True,2xCJUiEAAAAJ:LvS0yHEg1QsC,62,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002140050285,14424300493775187412,/scholar?cites=14424300493775187412,,,0,0,0

The algorithm consists of an iterative procedure based on the imposition of the generalized Brillouin theorem to a complete active space-configuration interaction wave function. At convergence. the wave function is identical to the corresponding one obtained using canonical CAS–SCF orbitals. provided the nature of the active space is the same.

Extrapolation procedures with CAS or selected zero-order spaces,1997,Celestino Angeli and Renzo Cimiraglia and Maurizio Persico and Alessandro Toniolo,98,Theoretical Chemistry Accounts,1,57-63,Springer-Verlag, We discuss the “three class” approximation to full multireference perturbation CI. which greatly reduces the computational effort by restricting the summation of diagrams to determinants belonging to a subspace of the zero-order space. In the framework of the CIPSI algorithm. we propose a new extrapolation procedure allowing recovery of the full “two class” results. The new procedure is applied to complete active spaces (CAS) and to individually selected zero-order spaces. Comparison with a full two class calculation on a CAS shows a reduction of computer time of one or two orders of magnitude in the tests presented here. with an accuracy in the order of 0.1 kcal/mol. Our procedure can thus compete with the CASPT2 algorithm. specifically conceived to deal with CAS.

Their prevalence is increasing worldwide. and the 2 conditions often coexist in the same patient. Hypertension and AF are strikingly related to an excess risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Hypertension ultimately increases the risk of AF. and because of its high prevalence in the population. it accounts for more cases of AF than other risk factors. Among patients with established AF. hypertension is present in about 60% to 80% of individuals. Despite the well-known association between hypertension and AF. several pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the higher risk of AF in hypertensive patients are still incompletely known.

The initial step in olfaction involves the translocation of odorants from the periphery through the aqueous lymph of the olfactory sensilla to the odorant receptors most likely by chemosensory proteins (CSPs) or odorant binding proteins (OBPs). To better understand the roles of CSPs and OBPs in a coleopteran pest species. the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera. Tenebrionidae). we performed transcriptome analyses of male and female antennae. heads. mouthparts. legs. and bodies. which revealed that all 20 CSPs and 49 of the 50 previously annotated OBPs are transcribed.

A Wiley Company,This paper first comments on the surprisingly poor status that Quantum Chemistry has offered to the fantastic intuition of Lewis concerning the distribution of the electrons in the molecule. Then. it advocates in favor of a hierarchical description of the molecular wave‐function. distinguishing the physics taking place in the valence space (in the bond and between the bonds). and the dynamical correlation effects. It is argued that the clearest pictures of the valence electronic population combine two localized views. namely the bond (and lone pair) Molecular Orbitals and the Valence Bond decomposition of the wave‐function. preferably in the orthogonal version directly accessible from the complete active space self consistent field method. Such a reading of the wave function enables one to understand the work of the nondynamical correlation as an enhancement of the weight of the low‐energy VB components. i.e. as a …,True,2xCJUiEAAAAJ:MDBbo4b0KHEC,58,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.20546,11211303176934925930,/scholar?cites=11211303176934925930,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jcc.20546,0,0,0

Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis is admittedly the most frequent secondary osteoporosis. The pathogenesis still has many unresolved issues. Although the effects of GCs on cytokine production and recognition have been extensively studied. little is known about the effects of cytokines on GC action at the target level. We have focused on the effects of IL-6 and IL-11 on specific binding by type I1 GC receptors (GRs) in two human osteoblast-like cell lines (Saos-2 and MG-63) that have remarkably different constitutive expression of these cytokines and GRs as well. We have provided evidence that IL-6 upregulates GR binding sites. while IL-11 downregulates these sites. as determined by radioligand binding assay and Scatchard analysis. GR affinity (Kd) did not change after exposure to both cytokines. A number of experiments were consistent with the view that in human osteoblast-like cells. cytokines of the IL-6 family have autocrine modulatory effects on GRa (GRP is a variant that does not bind specifically in our method).

10098303,Crowding effects promote coexistence in the chemostat,2006,Patrick De Leenheer and David Angeli and Eduardo D Sontag,319,Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications,1,48-60,Academic Press,This paper deals with an almost-global stability result for a particular chemostat model. It deviates from the classical chemostat because crowding effects are taken into consideration. This model can be rewritten as a negative feedback interconnection of two systems which are monotone (as input/output systems). Moreover. these subsystems behave nicely when subject to constant inputs. This allows the use of a particular small-gain theorem which has recently been developed for feedback interconnections of monotone systems. Application of this theorem requires—at least approximate—knowledge of two gain functions associated to the subsystems. It turns out that for the chemostat model proposed here. these approximations can be obtained explicitly and this leads to a sufficient condition for almost-global stability. In addition. we show that coexistence occurs in this model if the crowding effects are large enough.,True,2xCJUiEAAAAJ:Q7hiZQKJ-pAC,43,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X06001211,16236769378483214231,/scholar?cites=16236769378483214231,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X06001211/pdf?md5=b3c540cb71de551be0d3012da916abb2&pid=1-s2.0-S0022247X06001211-main.pdf&_valck=1,0,0,0

10098316,Command governors for constrained nonlinear systems: direct nonlinear vs. linearization‐based strategies,1999,David Angeli and Alessandro Casavola and Edoardo Mosca,9,International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control: IFAC‐Affiliated Journal,10,677-699,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,Two command governors (CG) are described for solving set‐point tracking problems for nonlinear systems when pointwise‐in‐time input and/or state related inequality constraints have to be fulfilled. A CG is a nonlinear device which is added to a primal compensated system.

In this model. breakup and coalescence were assumed to take place in the vicinity of the impeller and away from that region. respectively. The mechanism of phase inversion was regarded as the result of an imbalance between the breakup and coalescence processes. Hence phase inversion was assumed to occur when the coalescence frequency exceeded that of breakup. In addition. the concept of a radial distribution function was adopted in the model in order to account for droplet coalescence in concentrated dispersions. Using the two-region model. the effect of interfacial tension. viscosity. density and impeller size on the width of the ambivalent range was investigated.

The bacterial infection-induced AKI usually meets the diagnostic criteria of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Well in keeping with the “splanchnic arterial vasodilation hypothesis”. it has been stated that HRS develops as a consequence of a severe reduction of effective circulating volume related to splanchnic arterial vasodilation and to an inadequate cardiac output.

The problem of efficiently coordinating price-responsive appliances operating in the electricity market is tackled within a game-theoretical framework. Adopting the concept of Nash equilibrium and Lyapunov-based techniques. a new iterative control algorithm is designed in order to always converge to a satisfactory solution for the individual customers. which aim at minimizing their energy costs. From the system perspective. it is shown that global quantities such as total generation costs are reduced at each algorithm iteration. These results are achieved for any penetration level of flexible demand and for all types of interruptible electrical appliances.

Methods: The incidence of hip fractures after 45 years of age in both females and males during the years 1999-2002 was obtained by analyzing the Italian Ministry of Health national hospitalization database. according to the diagnosis codes of International Classification of Diseases. Clinical Modification. 9 edition (IDC-9-CM) that indicate femoral fracture. We have computed all direct costs sustained by the National Health Service for hospitalization and treatment of hip fractures on the basis of the value of the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) referring to hip fractures. The expenses of rehabilitation and indirect expenses were based on estimates. Results: In 2002. more than 86.000 hip fractures were registered in Italy in male and female patients over 45 years old. with 9% progression compared to 1999; 77% were female and 80% were over 75 years of age. In 2002 the direct costs of hospitalization. in the patients over 65 years alone. were almost 400 milion euros. with an increase of 15% as compared to 1999. Considering also estimated rehabilitation costs. social aid and indirect costs. we estimate that hip fractures due to age-related osteoporosis created over a billion euros in expenses in 2002.

In the present study. we aimed at evaluating whether serial determinations of aminopyrine breath test and Child-Pugh score improve prognostic accuracy in patients with cirrhosis. compared with determinations obtained only on admission. PATIENTS: In 74 patients with liver cirrhosis aminopyrine breath test and Child-Pugh score were obtained upon entry into the study. Patients were followed with sequential aminopyrine breath tests and assessments of the Child-Pugh score every 4-6 months. A total number of 232 determinations were obtained. During follow-up 45 patients died. on average after 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Child-Pugh score improved in the beginning of follow-up. and then remained fairly constant; aminopyrine breath test showed no improvement in the beginning of follow-up. but rather a slowly progressive decline. In patients who died. both the Child-Pugh score and the metabolism of aminopyrine were significantly more impaired in the last year preceding death (p< 0.05).

10098472,Cytotoxic chemotherapy for adrenocortical carcinoma.,1995,Luigi Dogliotti and Alfredo Berruti and A Pia and Piero Paccotti and A Ali and Alberto Angeli,20,,1,105-109,,The efficacy of mitotane in providing objective tumour responses in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). has been recently questioned. Experience with non specific chemotherapy is limited. Tumour responses have been reported with cisplatin administered as a single agent or in combination. Other reports however failed to show benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy. The very low number of patients included in each study. mostly of them previously treated with mitotane. may account for these controversial results. The finding that multidrug resistance mediated by MDR-1/P-glycoprotein can be reverted by mitotane provides a rational basis for exploring the use of mitotane in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. In a multicenter cooperative (SWOG) phase II study. a combination of mitotane+ cisplatin appeared active in advanced ACC. with 30% response rate in 37 eligible patients. These results prompted us to evaluate the activity of a combination chemotherapy of Eto-poside. Adriamycin and Cisplatin (EAP) in association with mitotane (4 g daily per os). Up to now we treated 6 patients. obtaining 3 partial responses. Recently. new drugs as suramin and gossypol have been show to have some activity in patients with surgically unresectable ACC. suggesting the need for further investigation. In conclusion. cytotoxic drugs+ mitotane and new adrenocorticolytic/cytotoxic agents. should be explored as first line treatments in patients with advanced ACC.

The impulsive activity phase can be suppressed by infusing 50 μg/hr of dexamethasone from 10 PM to 4 am. The basal activity phase can be suppressed only by infusing 100 μg/hr of dexamethasone. Recovery of the basal activity after total suppression occurs even in the absence of the early morning impulsive phase. The hypothesis is put forward that the 2 phases are activated by different mechanisms.

A Wiley Company,The importance of the dynamic σ polarization (absent in methods where the σ skeleton is treated at a mean‐field level) for the correct description of the V state of the ethene molecule has been recognized by many authors in the past. In this article. this physical effect is analyzed and it is seen as arising from the sum of two contributions: the polarization of the σ CC bond and of the σ CH bonds. In both cases it is described in a valence bond scheme and the types of excitations needed in a molecular orbital frame to introduce such effects are identified. The effect of the dynamic σ polarization on the spatial extent of the V state (<x2>) is described. The analysis here reported has been used in a recent article (Angeli.

For large storage populations. the problem can be approximated as a differential game with infinite players (mean field game). Through the resolution of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). it is possible to determine. as a fixed point. the optimal feedback strategy for each player and the resulting price of energy if that strategy is applied. Once this price is calculated. it can be communicated to the devices. which are able to independently determine their optimal charge profile. Simulation results are provided. calculating the fixed point through numerical integration of the PDEs.

Plasma leakage is the most life threatening condition of DEN and may lead to hypovolaemic shock if not properly managed. Materials and Methods: We recently reported a unique dengue virus strain (D2Y98P) which upon intraperitoneal (IP) administration to immunocompromised mice led to systemic viral dissemination. intestine damage. liver dysfunction. and increased vascular permeability. hallmarks of severe DEN in patients (Tan et al. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2010; 4: e672). Results: Here we report the clinical manifestations and features observed in mice subcutaneously (SC) infected with D2Y98P. which is a route of administration closer to natural infection. Similar to the IP route. increased vascular permeability. intestine damage. liver dysfunction. transient lymphopenia (but no thrombocytopenia) were observed in the SC infected mice. Furthermore. the SC route of infection was found more potent than the IP route whereby higher viral titers and earlier time-of-death rates were measured. In addition. various staining approaches revealed structurally intact blood vessels in the moribund animals despite pronounced systemic vascular leakage. as reported in dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) patients. Interestingly. measurement of soluble mediators involved in vascular permeability indicated that vascular leakage may occur at an early stage of the disease. as proposed in DEN patients.

Type I collagen was extracted from fish scales as a potential alternative source of collagen for tissue engineering applications. Since unmodified collagen typically has poor mechanical and degradation stability both in vitro and in vivo. additional methylation modification and 1.4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDE) crosslinking steps were used to improve the physicochemical properties of fish scale-derived collagen. Subsequently. in vivo studies using a murine model demonstrated the biocompatibility of the different fish scale-derived collagen patches. In general. favorable integration of the collagen patches to the surrounding tissues. with good infiltration of cells. blood vessels (BVs) and lymphatic vessels (LVs) were observed under growth factor-free conditions.

Our motivation for pulse-based control comes from applications in synthetic biology. where it is generally difficult to implement real-time feedback control systems due to technical limitations in sensors and actuators. We show that for monotone bistable systems. the estimation of the set of all pulses that switch the system reduces to the computation of one non-increasing curve. We provide an efficient algorithm to compute this curve and illustrate the results with a genetic bistable system commonly used in synthetic biology. We also extend these results to models with parametric uncertainty and provide a number of examples and counterexamples that demonstrate the power and limitations of the current theory.

The control of the disease is limited because our understanding of basic aspects of the epidemiology. including the transmission routes of leptospires among rat populations. remains incomplete. Through the ability to distinguish among Leptospira strains in rats. multispacer sequence typing (MST) could provide a modern understanding of Leptospira epidemiology; however. to our knowledge. the distribution of Leptospira strains among urban rat colonies has not been investigated using MST.   Aims and Methodology The objective of this study was to identify the Leptospira strains present in rats (Rattus norvegicus) in Lyon (France) using MST and to characterize their spatial distribution. Kidneys and urine were collected from rats trapped live in seven locations in the city and in one suburban location. Each location was considered to represent a rat colony. Bacterial cultures and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were performed. and the L. interrogans DNA identified was then genotyped using MST. The distributions of Leptospira strains were spatially described.   Key Results Among 84 wild rats. MST profiles were obtained in 35 of 37 rats that had a positive result for L. interrogans by bacterial culture and/or qPCR analyses. All of the MST profiles were related to reference strains previously isolated from human patients that belong to the serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae and the serovars [strain(s)] Copenhageni [Wijinberg or M20] (n = 26).

We believe that this stricter form of average constraints (compared to previously proposed asymptotic average constraints) is of independent interest in various applications such as the operation of a chemical reactor. where e.g. the amount of inflow or the heat flux during some fixed period of time must not exceed a certain value. Besides guaranteeing fulfillment of transient average constraints for the closed-loop system. we show that closed-loop average performance bounds and convergence results established in the setting of asymptotic average constraints also hold in case of transient average constraints.

The DDCI space contains all single and double semi-active excitations on the top of the complete active space. which is only composed of the magnetic orbitals. The main drawback of the procedure is its computational cost. in particular for systems involving several metallic centres with S > ½. To overcome this constraint. an alternative strategy has been proposed in the past which consists in restricting the CI expansion to single excitations on the top of an extended active space. involving a few doubly occupied and in some cases virtual orbitals of ligand character.

Different mass ratios of surfactant to oil below the CMC value. up to ϕ= 5× 10− 4. of a non-ionic surfactant dissolved in the organic phase were studied. It was found that an increase in the surfactant concentration promoted the deformation of the interface before the film that separated the drop from the interface ruptured.

We investigated the genetic diversity of Leptospira in 28 species of wildlife other than rats using variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) and multispacer sequence typing (MST). The DNA of pathogenic Leptospira was detected in the kidney tissues of 201 individuals out of 3.738 tested individuals. A wide diversity. including 50 VNTR profiles and 8 MST profiles. was observed.

The initial evaluation of a patient with ascites should include a history. physical evaluation. paracentesis with ascitic fluid analysis. abdominal ultrasonography and biochemistry to assess the severity of liver disease and renal functionality. To improve the efficiency of the choice between the different opportunities available in the treatment of ascites. patients can be classified into two subgroups: patients with uncomplicated ascites and patients with complicated ascites. including refractory ascites. bacterial peritonitis. hyponatraemia and renal failure. Based upon evidence emerging from controlled clinical trials or case-control studies. satisfactory treatment for uncomplicated ascites is represented by paracentesis. sodium-restricted diet and diuretics. whereas the treatment of patients with complicated ascites requires other specific approaches. As the prognosis for most patients with ascites is poor. the last part of the paper offers simple criteria in the selection of patients candidates for liver transplantation.

The receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)/RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) system is involved in vascular biology. Our aim was to assess OPG and soluble RANKL (sRANKL) serum levels in patients with SSc and healthy controls.Sixty patients with SSc (median age 58. range 31–72 yrs) and 60 healthy subjects matched for age. sex. and menopausal status were recruited. Serum OPG. sRANKL. soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM; marker of endothelial activation/injury). and bone turnover markers were measured. Bone mineral density in patients was assessed and cardiovascular/coronary risk was estimated.OPG was similar in the 2 groups. while sRANKL and sRANKL/OPG ratio was higher in patients (p = 0.01 for both). sVCAM was markedly higher in patients (p < 0.001).

An accurate ab initio treatment of these states in transition metal compounds is intrinsically difficult for both time-dependent density functional and wave function-based methods. The rather large dependence of the MMCT energies on the applied functional makes difficult to extract reliable estimates from density functional theory. while the standard multiconfigurational approach (complete active space SCF + second-order perturbation theory) leads to severe intruder state problems and unrealistic. negative energies. The analysis of the failure of the multiconfigurational approach shows that the state-average orbitals are biased toward the ground state and strongly deficient to describe the MMCT …,True,2xCJUiEAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC,21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00214-012-1264-1,1980299909879579406,/scholar?cites=1980299909879579406,,,0,0,0

The Maxwell−Stefan equations can be solved analytically (only in special cases) or by numerical approaches. Different numerical strategies have been previously presented. but the number of diffusing species is normally restricted. with only few exceptions. to three in bulk diffusion and to two in microporous systems. unless simplifications of the Maxwell−Stefan equations are considered.

For instance. in the case of N weakly interacting hydrogen molecules. there are at least N different minima in the case of a CAS(2/2). involving one bonding and one antibonding orbital on the same molecule. A similar result still holds for many systems for which the interaction is far from small. As an example. the case of the ethylene molecule is discussed. where three CAS(2/2) and six CAS(4/4) non-equivalent minima are present. The use of localized orbitals permits one to choose the particular solution one wants to converge to. The implications of these results on CASSCF calculations are significant. since by choosing different minima one can focus the CASSCF description on a given characteristic (e.g.. the spatial position) of the active orbitals.

Previous results assumed that the partial orders adopted would be induced by positivity cones in input and output spaces and that such positivity cones should fulfill a compatibility rule: namely either be coincident or be opposite. Those two configurations correspond to positive feedback or negative feedback cases. We relax those results by allowing arbitrary orthant orders.A linear example is provided showing that the small-gain iteration used for the negative feedback case is not sufficient for global attractivity under mixed feedback.

PP is largely determined by the stroke volume in young subjects. although the progressive amplification of pulse wave from central to peripheral arteries could make brachial PP not representative of the central PP in the young. With advancing age. brachial PP better reflects the progressive stiffening of aorta and the large elastic arteries. PP correlates with vascular and cardiac hypertrophy. although the association with cardiac hypertrophy seems more closely attributable to systolic blood pressure (BP). An association has been noted in several longitudinal studies between PP and the incidence of major cardiovascular events. However. some longitudinal studies carried out in subjects with predominantly systolic and diastolic hypertension showed that PP is the dominant predictor of coronary events. while mean BP is the major …,True,2xCJUiEAAAAJ:WM2K3OHRCGMC,20,https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/96727,5710823992509434344,/scholar?cites=5710823992509434344,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Cockcroft/publication/6721689_Cholesterol_Lipids_and_Arterial_Stiffness/links/560e4e5508ae2aa0be4a8add/Cholesterol-Lipids-and-Arterial-Stiffness.pdf#page=159,0,0,0

Aliskiren's inhibitory effect on angiotensin I generation. through renin blockade. is highly specific and long-lasting (24 hours). This feature differentiates aliskiren from traditional antihypertensive drugs.  Areas covered:  This paper reviews the results of various clinical trials which investigate the safety and efficacy of aliskiren on blood pressure (BP) reduction and clinical end points.  Expert opinion:  Aliskiren is suitable for once-daily administration. Its antihypertensive effect is comparable or superior to that of other antihypertensive agents at recommended doses. The tolerability profile of aliskiren is placebo-like at the licensed doses of 150 and 300 mg. In particular. the discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events occurs similarly among patients treated with either aliskiren or placebo.

Hence. developing salt‐tolerant crops is essential for sustaining food production. Progress in breeding for salt‐tolerant crops has been hampered by the lack of understanding of the molecular basis of salt tolerance and lack of availability of genes that confer salt tolerance. Genetic evidence suggests that perception of salt stress leads to a cytosolic calcium‐signal that activates the calcium sensor protein SOS3. SOS3 binds to and activates a ser/thr protein kinase SOS2. The activated SOS2 kinase regulates activities of SOS1. a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter. and NHX1. a tonoplast Na+/H+ antiporter. This results in Na+ efflux and vacuolar compartmentation.

Mutations in SOS2 cause Na+ and K+ imbalance and render plants more sensitive toward growth inhibition by high Na+ and low K+ environments. We isolated the SOS2 gene through positional cloning. SOS2 is predicted to encode a serine/threonine type protein kinase with an N-terminal catalytic domain similar to that of the yeast SNF1 kinase.

Recent genetic and biochemical studies in Arabidopsis have demonstrated that a subfamily of DNA glycosylases function to promote DNA demethylation through a base excision-repair pathway. These specialized bifunctional DNA glycosylases remove the 5-methylcytosine base and then cleave the DNA backbone at the abasic site. resulting in a gap that is then filled with an unmethylated cytosine nucleotide by as yet unknown DNA polymerase and ligase enzymes. Evidence suggests that active DNA demethylation in mammalian cells is also mediated at least in part by a base excision repair pathway where the AID/Apobec family of deaminases convert 5-methylcytosine to thymine followed by G/T mismatch repair by the DNA glycosylase MBD4 or TDG.

However. the functional significance of miRNAs in adaptive responses to nitrogen (N) limitation remains to be explored.  • The Arabidopsis miR169 was strongly down‐regulated. whereas its targets. NFYA (Nuclear Factor Y. subunit A) family members. were strongly induced by nitrogen N starvation. Analysis of the expression of miR169 precursors showed that MIR169a was substantially down‐regulated in both roots and shoots by N starvation. Accumulation of the NFYA family members was suppressed in transgenic Arabidopsis with constitutive expression of MIR169a.  • Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing MIR169a accumulated less N and were more sensitive to N stress than the wild type.

Two general strategies have been applied to coexpress multiple single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to achieve multiplex gene editing in plant cells. One is to construct the multiple guide RNA expression cassettes into separate plasmids when direct gene delivery methods are adopted. such as biolistic bombardment and PEG-mediated protoplast transfection (Shan et al.. 2013). The other is to assemble the multiple sgRNAs into a single vector when the Agrobacteria-mediated gene transformation method is used.

The effect of cold stress was monitored using 32P-labelled seedlings and leaf discs of Arabidopsis thaliana. Low. non-freezing temperatures were found to trigger a very rapid 32P-PtdOH increase. peaking within 2 and 5 min. respectively. In principle. PtdOH can be generated through three different pathways. i.e. i) via de novo phospholipid biosynthesis (through acylation of lyso-PtdOH). ii) via phospholipase D hydrolysis of structural phospholipids or iii) via phosphorylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) by DAG kinase (DGK). Using a differential 32P-labelling protocol and a PLD-transphosphatidylation assay. evidence is provided that the rapid 32P-PtdOH response was primarily generated through DGK. A simultaneous decrease in the levels of 32P-PtdInsP. correlating in time. temperature dependency and magnitude with the increase in 32P-PtdOH. suggested that a PtdInsP-hydrolyzing PLC generated the DAG in this reaction. Testing T-DNA insertion lines available for the seven DGK genes. revealed no clear changes in 32P-PtdOH responses. suggesting functional redundancy. Similarly. known cold-stress mutants were analyzed to investigate whether the PtdOH response acted downstream of the respective gene products.

Measurements of particle production provide insight into the behavior of QCD interactions at low momentum transfer. typically described by models with empirical parameters tuned from experimental data. Accurate modeling of such interactions is also essential for constraining the effects of the underlying event in the high-pT collisions studied at the LHC. As the strange quark is heavier than the up and down quarks. the production of strange hadrons is suppressed relative to hadrons containing only up and down quarks. However. since the mass of the strange quark is comparable in value to the ÃQCD scale constant. it is not sufficiently heavy for perturbative techniques to be used in modeling the production of strange hadrons and experimental input is required to tune it in Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Moreover. the ratio of the production of strange antibaryons to strange baryons is related to the transfer of baryon number from the colliding protons to the midrapidity region and can be used to constrain ‘‘diquark’’[4] and ‘‘string-junction’’[5] models in MC generators.

This has proved particularly interesting for the gene encoding chalcone synthase (CHS). Whereas phytochrome control of CHS gene expression is regulated positively by cGMP and negatively by calcium and calmodulin. in UV light calcium and calmodulin appear to act as positive regulators. Results from combined red and UV irradiations indicate that the phytochrome response is activated first and that the UV photoreceptor response is activated subsequently.

Adverse environmental conditions. such as those causing abiotic stress. often cause significant losses in crop productivity and quality. Because of a paucity of well-defined visible phenotypes. conventional genetic screens have not been very successful in isolating abiotic stress signal transduction mutants of plants.

Plants have evolved mechanisms to perceive these environmental challenges. transmit the stress signals within cells as well as between cells and tissues. and make appropriate adjustments in their growth and development in order to survive and reproduce. In recent years. significant progress has been made on many fronts of the stress signaling research. particularly in understanding the downstream signaling events that culminate at the activation of stress- and nutrient limitation-responsive genes. cellular ion homeostasis. and growth adjustment. However. the revelation of the early events of stress signaling. particularly the identification of primary stress sensors. still lags behind.

We found that the cell-wall leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRX) 3/4/5 are critical for plant salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. The LRXs physically associate with the RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides RALF22/23. which in turn interact with the plasma membrane-localized receptor-like protein kinase FERONIA (FER). The lrx345 triple mutant as well as fer mutant plants display retarded growth and salt hypersensitivity. which are mimicked by overexpression of RALF22/23. Salt stress promotes S1P protease-dependent release of mature RALF22 peptides. Treatment of roots with mature RALF22/23 peptides or salt stress causes the internalization of FER. Our results suggest that the LRXs. RALFs. and FER function as a module to transduce cell …,True,5YnFcbIAAAAJ:BOlwja0KXvYC,63,https://www.pnas.org/content/115/51/13123.short,3376628719877985141,/scholar?cites=3376628719877985141,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/51/13123.full.pdf,0,0,0

The RD29A promoter‐driven LUCIFERASE transgene and its corresponding endogenous RD29A gene are hypermethylated and silenced in the Arabidopsis DNA demethylase mutant ros1. By screening for second‐site suppressors of ros1. we identified the RDM12 locus. The rdm12 mutation releases the silencing of the RD29A‐LUC transgene and the endogenous RD29A gene by reducing the promoter DNA methylation. The rdm12 mutation also reduces DNA methylation at endogenous RdDM target loci. including transposons and other repetitive sequences. In addition. the rdm12 mutation affects the levels of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from some of the RdDM target loci.

The measurement covers a wide pseudorapidity range from− 3.5 to 5. which is sufficient for reliable estimates of the total number of charged particles produced in the collisions. For the most central (0–5%) collisions we find 21 400±1 300. while for the most peripheral (80–90%) we find 230±38. This corresponds to an increase of (27±4)% over the results at s NN= 2.76 TeV previously reported by ALICE. The energy dependence of the total number of charged particles produced in heavy-ion collisions is found to obey a modified power-law like behaviour. The charged-particle pseudorapidity density of the most central collisions is compared to model calculations—none of which fully describes the measured distribution.
