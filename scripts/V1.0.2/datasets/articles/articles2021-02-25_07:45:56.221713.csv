The CFSR was designed and executed as a global. high-resolution coupled atmosphere–ocean–land surface–sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this period. The current CFSR will be extended as an operational. real-time product into the future. New features of the CFSR include 1) coupling of the atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6-h guess field. 2) an interactive sea ice model. and 3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) scheme over the entire period. The CFSR global atmosphere resolution is ~38 km (T382) with 64 levels extending from the surface to 0.26 hPa.

Alabama for 2002. Results indicate that there is a good correlation between the satellite‐derived AOT and PM2.5 (linear correlation coefficient.

There is excellent agreement between the monthly mean PM2.5 and MODIS AOT (R > 0.9). with maximum values during the summer months due to enhanced photolysis. The PM2.5 has a distinct diurnal signature with maxima in the early morning (6:00 ∼ 8:00AM) due to increased traffic flow and restricted mixing depths during these hours.

Stacking of individual two-dimensional MGPs is effectively inhibited by introducing one-dimensional MWCNTs. Long and tortuous MWCNTs can bridge adjacent MGPs and inhibit their aggregation. resulting in a high contact area between the MGP/MWCNT structures and the polymer matrix. Scanning electron microscope images of the fracture surfaces of the epoxy matrix showed that MWCNT/MGP hybrid nanofillers exhibited higher solubility and better compatibility than individual MWCNTs and MGPs did. The tensile strength of GD400-MWCNT/MGP/epoxy composites was 35.4% higher than that of the epoxy alone. compared to only a 0.9% increase in tensile strength for MGP/epoxy …,True,visHnnkAAAAJ:9qGwjJavaBUC,727,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622310007244,12321494835837425213,/scholar?cites=12321494835837425213,,,0,0,0

This can be achieved with the help of surface-energy patterns causing inks to be repelled and dewetted from pre-defined regions of the substrate. To exploit this principle for the fabrication of submicrometre device structures. a detailed understanding of the factors causing ink droplets to dewet on patterned surfaces is required. Here. we use hydrophobic surface-energy barriers of different geometries to study the influence of solution viscosity. ink volume. and contact angle on the process of dewetting of inkjet-printed droplets of a water-based conducting polymer.

Four critical countries (China. USA. Canada and Australia) were examined in detail with projections made on the state/province level. Ultimately Recoverable Resources (URR) for fossil fuels were estimated for three scenarios: Low = 48.4 ZJ. Best Guess (BG) = 75.7 ZJ. High = 121.5 ZJ. The scenarios were developed using Geologic Resources Supply-Demand Model (GeRS-DeMo). The Low and Best Guess (BG) scenarios suggest that world fossil fuel production may peak before 2025 and decline rapidly thereafter. The High scenario indicates that fossil fuels may have a strong growth till 2025 followed by a plateau lasting approximately 50 years before declining.

1102983,Complex plasmas and colloidal dispersions: particle-resolved studies of classical liquids and solids,2012,Alexei Ivlev and Gregor Morfill and Hartmut Lowen and C Patrick Royall,5,,,,World Scientific Publishing Company,Many fundamental issues in classical condensed matter physics can be addressed experimentally using systems of individually visible mesoscopic particles playing the role of “proxy atoms”. The interaction between such “atoms” is determined by the properties of the surrounding medium and/or by external tuning. The best-known examples of such experimental model systems are two different domains of soft matter—complex plasmas and colloidal dispersions. The major goal of this book—written by scientists representing both complex plasmas and colloidal dispersions—is to bring the two fields together. In the first part of the book the basic properties of the two systems are summarized. demonstrating huge conceptual and methodological overlap of the fields and emphasizing numerous cross-connections between them and their essential complementarity. This “introductory part” should serve to help each community in understanding the other field better. Simultaneously. this provides the necessary basis for the second part focused on particle-resolved studies of diverse generic phenomena in liquids and solids—all performed with complex plasmas and/or colloidal dispersions. The book is concluded with the discussion of critical open issues and fascinating perspectives of such interdisciplinary research.,True,z6icpdAAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C,299,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=H5JIDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:mCBwJRn53V8J:scholar.google.com&ots=gmDk2jc2vZ&sig=s7RpOHKs8e4Hes-bJeFJvoDjVpA,6907951289853812888,/scholar?cites=6907951289853812888,,,0,0,0

Here. we report that alignment of water soluble biomacromolecules can be achieved in the presence of the naturally occurring two-dimensional crystals (purple membrane) of the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin. The extent of the alignment is tunable by the concentration of purple membranes and by the addition of salt which reduces the strength of the electric interaction between solute macromolecule and the membrane.

Particular attention was paid to the so-called phonon-induced self-trapping transition. which. it was believed. should manifest itself as a point of nonanalyticity in the ground-state energy as a function of the electron-phonon coupling parameter. It will be demonstrated for a large class of (generalized Fröhlich) models that no such transition exists. The dimensionality of space has no qualitative influence; insofar. an application of the authors' results to problems in lower dimensions (eg. polarons in quantum wells) is straightforward. The same holds true if homogeneous external fields are involved; for example. a discontinuous mass stripping for magnetopolarons can be excluded.

The hybrid description considers the macroion degrees of freedom explicitly. while the microscopic counterions are treated within the framework of density functional theory.

By simultaneously monitoring CtpS polymerization and enzymatic activity. we show that polymerization inhibits activity. and CtpS's product. CTP. induces assembly. To understand how assembly inhibits activity. we used electron microscopy to define the structure of CtpS polymers. This structure suggests that polymerization sterically hinders a conformational change necessary for CtpS activity. Structure-guided mutagenesis and mathematical modeling further indicate that coupling activity to polymerization promotes cooperative catalytic regulation. This previously uncharacterized regulatory mechanism is important for cellular function since a mutant that disrupts CtpS polymerization disrupts E. coli growth and metabolic regulation without reducing CTP levels.

1103025,The structure and function of bacterial actin homologs,2010,Joshua W Shaevitz and Zemer Gitai,2,,9,a000364,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,During the past decade. the appreciation and understanding of how bacterial cells can be organized in both space and time have been revolutionized by the identification and characterization of multiple bacterial homologs of the eukaryotic actin cytoskeleton. Some of these bacterial actins. such as the plasmid-borne ParM protein. have highly specialized functions. whereas other bacterial actins. such as the chromosomally encoded MreB protein. have been implicated in a wide array of cellular activities. In this review we cover our current understanding of the structure. assembly. function. and regulation of bacterial actins. We focus on ParM as a well-understood reductionist model and on MreB as a central organizer of multiple aspects of bacterial cell biology. We also discuss the outstanding puzzles in the field and possible directions where this fast-developing area may progress in the future.,True,Ff8o0AUAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,84,https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/2/9/a000364.short,14841020422866210752,/scholar?cites=14841020422866210752,,https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/2/9/a000364.full.pdf,0,0,0
1103026,A CRISPRi screen in E. coli reveals sequence-specific toxicity of dCas9,2018,Lun Cui and Antoine Vigouroux and François Rousset and Hugo Varet and Varun Khanna and David Bikard,9,Nature communications,1,1-10,Nature Publishing Group,High-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screens have recently emerged as powerful tools to decipher gene functions and genetic interactions. Here we use a genome-wide library of guide RNAs to direct the catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) to block gene transcription in Escherichia coli. Using a machine-learning approach. we reveal that guide RNAs sharing specific 5-nucleotide seed sequences can produce strong fitness defects or even kill E. coli regardless of the other 15 nucleotides of guide sequence. This effect occurs at high dCas9 concentrations and can be alleviated by tuning the expression of dCas9 while maintaining strong on-target repression. Our results also highlight the fact that off-targets with as little as nine nucleotides of homology to the guide RNA can strongly block gene expression. Altogether this study provides important design rules to safely use dCas9 in E. coli.,True,SoP1qPAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,96,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04209-5,2516927143453222182,/scholar?cites=2516927143453222182,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04209-5,0,0,0

The catalytically dead variant of Cas9 known as dCas9 can be guided by small RNAs to block transcription of target genes. in a strategy also known as CRISPRi. Here. we reveal that the level of complementarity between the guide RNA and the target controls the rate at which RNA polymerase “kicks out” dCas9 from the target and completes transcription. We use this mechanism to precisely and robustly reduce gene expression by defined relative amounts. Alternatively. tuning repression by changing dCas9 concentration is noisy and promoter‐strength dependent. We demonstrate broad applicability of this method to the study of genetic regulation and cellular physiology. First. we characterize feedback strength of a model auto‐repressor.

To understand how the combined action of these two systems defines bacterial dimensions. we examined how each affects the growth and width of Bacillus subtilis as well as the mechanical anisotropy and orientation of material within their sacculi. Rod width is not determined by MreB. rather it depends on the balance between the systems: the Rod complex reduces diameter. whereas aPBPs increase it. Increased Rod-complex activity correlates with an increased density of directional MreB filaments and a greater fraction of directional PBP2a enzymes.

In rod-shaped Escherichia coli. two conserved sets of machinery are essential for cell-wall insertion in the cylindrical part of the cell: the Rod complex and the class-A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs). While the Rod complex governs rod-like cell shape. aPBP function is less well understood. aPBPs were previously hypothesized to either work in concert with the Rod complex or to independently repair cell-wall defects. First. we demonstrate through modulation of enzyme levels that aPBPs do not contribute to rod-like cell shape but are required for mechanical stability. supporting their independent activity.

The most common strategy relies on the use of Cas effectors modified to bind target DNA without introducing DNA breaks. These effectors can either block the RNA polymerase or recruit it through activation domains. Here. we discuss the mechanistic details of how Cas effectors can modulate gene expression by blocking transcription initiation or acting as transcription roadblocks. CRISPR-Cas tools can be further engineered to obtain fine-tuned control of gene expression or target multiple genes simultaneously.

The cell-wall-synthesis machinery responsible for rod shape in Escherichia coli is the processive 'Rod complex'. Previously. cytoplasmic MreB filaments were thought to govern formation and localization of Rod complexes based on local cell-envelope curvature. Using single-particle tracking of the transpeptidase and Rod-complex component PBP2. we found that PBP2 binds to a substrate different from MreB. Depletion and localization experiments of other putative Rod-complex components provide evidence that none of those provide the sole rate-limiting substrate for PBP2 binding. Consistently. we found only weak correlations between MreB and envelope curvature in the cylindrical part of cells. Residual correlations do not require curvature-based Rod-complex initiation but can be attributed to persistent rotational motion. We therefore speculate that the local cell-wall architecture provides the cue for Rod-complex initiation. either through direct binding by PBP2 or through an unknown intermediate.,True,SoP1qPAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,11,https://elifesciences.org/articles/50629,2056956687419906796,/scholar?cites=2056956687419906796,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/50629.pdf,0,0,0

1103035,Genetic control of bacterial morphogenesis,2019,Antoine Vigouroux,,,,,,Since the discovery of DNA. our understanding of the morphogenesis of bacterial cells has made great advance and also gave rise to new questions. Even though the bacterium Escherichia coli is able to maintain rod shape robustly. the genome does not encode any internal blueprint of what the cell should look like. Rather. cell shape is dynamically determined by the enzymes synthesizing the cell-wall. a rigid polymer that surrounds the cell. To quantitatively study the dependence of cell-wall biogenesis and cell shape on levels of essential cell-wall synthesis proteins. we use a nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas9 to partially block transcription. As this method had no been put into practice before. we thoroughly investigated its properties on a model system using fluorescent reporters. This led us to surprising findings: it was previously assumed that decreased levels of guide RNA complementarity would decrease repression strength by virtue of reduced occupancy of the target. We demonstrated a different mechanism: complementarity determines the probability that RNA polymerase kicks out dCas9 during the transcription attempt. while the rate of spontaneous dCas9 unbinding is negligibly small. If dCas9 levels are high enough to saturate the target this mechanism alone determines repression strength. This leads to desirable properties: First. relative repression strength is independent of native expression levels. Second. repression does not add any extrinsic noise to gene expression. These findings are now published in Molecular Systems Biology.

The time dependence is coupled to source and drain contacts. the gates controlling the tunnel-barrier heights. or to the gates that define the mesoscopic region.

A cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope was used to spatially resolve the electronic properties of individual magnetic atoms displaying the Kondo effect. Spectroscopic measurements performed on individual cobalt atoms on the surface of gold show an energetically narrow feature that is identified as the Kondo resonance—the predicted response of a Kondo impurity.

With the use of a simple lattice model of protein folding. it was demonstrated that structural regularities are related to high “designability” and evolutionary stability. The designability of each compact structure is measured by the number of sequences that can design the structure—that is. sequences that possess the structure as their nondegenerate ground state. Compact structures differ markedly in terms of their designability; highly designable structures emerge with a number of associated sequences much larger than the average. These highly designable structures possess “proteinlike” secondary structure and even tertiary symmetries. In addition. they are thermodynamically more stable than other structures.

The current and density of states are obtained via the noncrossing approximation for two spin-degenerate levels weakly coupled to two leads. At low temperatures. the Kondo peak in the equilibrium density of states strongly enhances the linear-response conductance. Application of a finite voltage bias reduces the conductance and splits the peak in the density of states.

Our examination of signal processing and integration in the V. harveyi quorum‐sensing circuit suggests that AI‐1 and AI‐2 act synergistically. and that the V. harveyi quorum‐sensing circuit may function exclusively as a ‘coincidence detector’that discriminates between conditions in which both autoinducers are present and all other conditions.,True,jDdbJHcAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,314,https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1093/emboj/cdg085,4662351414482517114,/scholar?cites=4662351414482517114,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1093/emboj/cdg085,0,0,0

The cell-wall-synthesis machinery responsible for rod shape in Escherichia coli is the processive 'Rod complex'. Previously. cytoplasmic MreB filaments were thought to govern formation and localization of Rod complexes based on local cell-envelope curvature. Using single-particle tracking of the transpeptidase and Rod-complex component PBP2. we found that PBP2 binds to a substrate different from MreB. Depletion and localization experiments of other putative Rod-complex components provide evidence that none of those provide the sole rate-limiting substrate for PBP2 binding. Consistently. we found only weak correlations between MreB and envelope curvature in the cylindrical part of cells. Residual correlations do not require curvature-based Rod-complex initiation but can be attributed to persistent rotational motion. We therefore speculate that the local cell-wall architecture provides the cue for Rod-complex initiation. either through direct binding by PBP2 or through an unknown intermediate.,True,zBI3Ds0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,11,https://elifesciences.org/articles/50629,2056956687419906796,/scholar?cites=2056956687419906796,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/50629.pdf,0,0,0

To control the level of crowding during growth cells must increase their volumes in response to the accumulation of biomass. Using Escherichia coli as a model organism. we found that cells control cell volume indirectly. by increasing cell-surface area in proportion to biomass growth. Thus. dry-mass density. a readout of intracellular crowding. varies in proportion to the surface-to-volume ratio. both during the cell cycle and during perturbations such as nutrient shifts. On long time scales after shifts. initial dry-mass density is nearly restored by slow variations of the surface-to-mass ratio. Contrary to a long-standing paradigm. cell-envelope expansion is controlled independently of cell-wall synthesis but responds to the activity of cell-wall cleaving hydrolases. Finally. we observed rapid changes of Turgor pressure after nutrient shifts. which were likely responsible for initial changes of cell diameter and dry-mass-density.

Here. we used an optical trap to measure the bending rigidity of live Escherichia coli cells. We find that the actin-homolog MreB contributes nearly as much to the stiffness of a cell as the peptidoglycan cell wall. By quantitatively modeling these measurements. our data indicate that the MreB is rigidly linked to the cell wall. increasing the mechanical stiffness of the overall system.

In nearly all bacteria. cell shape is determined by the architecture of the peptidoglycan cell wall. a macromolecule consisting of glycan strands crosslinked by peptides. In addition to shape. cell growth must also maintain the wall structural integrity to prevent lysis due to large turgor pressures. Robustness can be accomplished by establishing a globally ordered cell-wall network. although how a bacterium generates and maintains peptidoglycan order on the micron scale using nanometer-sized proteins remains a mystery. Here. we demonstrate that left-handed chirality of the MreB cytoskeleton in the rod-shaped bacterium Escherichia coli gives rise to a global. right-handed chiral ordering of the cell wall. Local.

To explore how descending neurons control an insect’s movements. we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial D. melanogaster. We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies. and we associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a large collection of descending neurons. we found that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors.

Three different situations are considered: a free chain. a chain confined to an external harmonic trap. and a chain dragged at one end. First. we consider an ideal chain with harmonic springs and no excluded volume between the monomers. The Rouse model of polymers is generalized to the case of self-propelled monomers and solved analytically.

While this ability. called viscotaxis. has been observed in several bacterial experiments. the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We provide a framework to study viscotaxis of biological or synthetic self-propelled swimmers in slowly varying viscosity fields and show that suitable body shapes create viscotaxis based on a systematic asymmetry of viscous forces acting on a microswimmer. Our results shed new light on viscotaxis in Spiroplasma and Leptospira and suggest that dynamic body shape changes exhibited by both types of microorganisms may have an unrecognized functionality: to prevent them from drifting to low viscosity regions where they swim poorly.

The underlying mechanism involves a synchronization of the colloids with the light-field. so that particles see the same intensity gradient each time the light-pattern is switched on. but no gradient in between (for example).

In this study. we used the type IV pilus of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to test whether variation of surface structures induces cell-sorting. We show that the rupture forces between pili are fine-tuned by post-translational modification. Bacterial sorting was dependent on pilus post-translational modification and pilus density. Active force generation was necessary for defined morphologies of mixed microcolonies. The observed morphotypes were in remarkable agreement with the differential strength of adhesion hypothesis proposing that a tug-of-war among surface structures of different cells governs cell sorting.

By combining measurements of cell-wall stiffness. cell-wall insertion. and PBP1b motion at the single-molecule level. we then present evidence that PBP1b. the major aPBP. contributes to cell-wall integrity by repairing cell wall defects.,True,8M3jQ9MAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,22,https://elifesciences.org/articles/51998,3543758884954906788,/scholar?cites=3543758884954906788,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/51998.pdf,0,0,0

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern bacterial positioning. Using the type IV pilus (T4P) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. we tested the hypothesis that the processes of phase and antigenic variation govern positioning and thus enhance bacterial fitness in expanding gonococcal colonies. By independently tuning growth rate and T4P-mediated interaction forces. we show that the loss of T4P and the subsequent segregation to the front confers a strong selective advantage.

These polymers are strong molecular motors that can retract at two different speeds. In the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae speed switching of single pili from 2 µm/s to 1 µm/s can be triggered by oxygen depletion. Here. we address the question how proton motive force (PMF) influences motor speed. Using pHluorin expression in combination with dyes that are sensitive to transmembrane ΔpH gradient or transmembrane potential ΔΨ. we measured both components of the PMF at varying external pH. Depletion of PMF using uncouplers reversibly triggered switching into the low speed mode. Reduction of the PMF by ≈ 35 mV was enough to trigger speed switching. Reducing ATP levels by inhibition of the ATP synthase did not induce speed switching. Furthermore. we showed that the strictly aerobic Myxococcus xanthus failed to move upon depletion of PMF or oxygen. indicating that although the mechanical properties of the motor are conserved. its regulatory inputs have evolved differently. We conclude that depletion of PMF triggers speed switching of gonococcal pili. Although ATP is required for gonococcal pilus retraction. our data indicate that PMF is an independent additional energy source driving the high speed mode.,True,8M3jQ9MAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,16,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067718,3352324814276038706,/scholar?cites=3352324814276038706,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067718,0,0,0

To control the level of crowding during growth cells must increase their volumes in response to the accumulation of biomass. Using Escherichia coli as a model organism. we found that cells control cell volume indirectly. by increasing cell-surface area in proportion to biomass growth. Thus. dry-mass density. a readout of intracellular crowding. varies in proportion to the surface-to-volume ratio. both during the cell cycle and during perturbations such as nutrient shifts. On long time scales after shifts. initial dry-mass density is nearly restored by slow variations of the surface-to-mass ratio. Contrary to a long-standing paradigm. cell-envelope expansion is controlled independently of cell-wall synthesis but responds to the activity of cell-wall cleaving hydrolases. Finally. we observed rapid changes of Turgor pressure after nutrient shifts. which were likely responsible for initial changes of cell diameter and dry-mass-density. Together. our experiments reveal important regulatory relationships for cell volume and shape.,True,8M3jQ9MAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,7,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/769786v1.abstract,4406291607027293036,/scholar?cites=4406291607027293036,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/09/16/769786.full.pdf,0,0,0

1103160,Differential physical interactions govern the spatial organisation of bacterial cell populations,2016,Enno Rainer Oldewurtel,,,,,,Structure and function are closely intertwined in multi-cellular organisms. The evolution of subdividing tissues into separate compartments and their subsequent maintenance gave rise to complex species. Spatial organisation is a key requirement for specialised cells to fulfil their specific functions. It is recognised that the initial segregation of cells in developing embryonic tissues is strongly influenced and indeed facilitated by differential physical interactions among different cell types. The mechanics inside a developing embryo closely resemble liquid-like properties of highly viscous fluids. Recently. the role of spatial organisation and maintenance of heterogeneity in bacterial biofilms has received increased attention. Traditionally. biofilm compositions might be seen as clumps of identical bacteria that passively grow at the site of their initial attachment to surfaces. However. these aggregates can be more than homogeneous clusters. Genetic differentiation and mutation hotspots that act at high frequencies can lead to differentially altered bacteria inside the same biofilm.In this study. we set out to investigate in how far spatial organisation can be promoted between bacteria with differentially altered surface properties. On top of passive growth at the position of their initial occurrence. differential physical interactions were shown to actively govern the architecture of early bacterial biofilms. We were able to genetically modify the physical interactions between bacteria of the species Neisseria gonorrhoeae by changing the properties of gonococcal typeIVpili (T4P). which are adhesive filaments that dominate cell-cell interactions in N. gonorrhoeae.

1103171,A curvature-mediated mechanism for localization of lipids to bacterial poles,2006,Kerwyn Casey Huang and Ranjan Mukhopadhyay and Ned S Wingreen,2,PLoS Comput Biol,11,e151,Public Library of Science,Subcellular protein localization is a universal feature of eukaryotic cells. and the ubiquity of protein localization in prokaryotic species is now acquiring greater appreciation. Though some targeting anchors are known. the origin of polar and division-site localization remains mysterious for a large fraction of bacterial proteins. Ultimately. the molecular components responsible for such symmetry breaking must employ a high degree of self-organization. Here we propose a novel physical mechanism. based on the two-dimensional curvature of the membrane. for spontaneous lipid targeting to the poles and division site of rod-shaped bacterial cells. If one of the membrane components has a large intrinsic curvature. the geometrical constraint of the plasma membrane by the more rigid bacterial cell wall naturally leads to lipid microphase separation.

Recent evidence of localization of the phospholipid cardiolipin to the poles of bacterial cells suggests that polar targeting of some proteins may rely on the membrane's differential lipid content.

During cytokinesis. the Z ring exerts a constrictive force on the membrane by using the chemical energy of guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis. However. the structural basis of this constriction remains unresolved. Here. we present the crystal structure of a guanosine diphosphate–bound Mycobacterium tuberculosis FtsZ protofilament. which exhibits a curved conformational state.

This hypothesis is based on analogy to plant cells. for which this mechanism has been established. and on experiments in which the growth rate of bacterial cultures was observed to decrease as the osmolarity of the growth medium was increased. To distinguish the effect of turgor pressure from pressure-independent effects that osmolarity might have on cell growth. we monitored the elongation of single Escherichia coli cells while rapidly changing the osmolarity of their media. By plasmolyzing cells. we found that cell-wall elastic strain did not scale with growth rate. suggesting that pressure does not drive cell-wall expansion.

The energetics of deformation allow two membrane proteins in close proximity to influence each other's equilibrium conformation via their local deformations. and spatially organize the proteins based on their geometry. We use the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) as a case study to examine the implications of bilayer-mediated elastic interactions on protein conformational statistics and clustering. The deformations around MscL cost energy on the order of 10 kBT and extend ∼3 nm from the protein edge. as such elastic forces induce cooperative gating. and we propose experiments to measure these effects. Additionally. since elastic interactions are coupled to protein conformation. we find that conformational changes can severely alter the average separation between two proteins.

1103192,A model of liver regeneration,2009,Leon A Furchtgott and Carson C Chow and Vipul Periwal,96,Biophysical journal,10,3926-3935,Cell Press,The network of interactions underlying liver regeneration is robust and precise with liver resections resulting in controlled hyperplasia (cell proliferation) that terminates when the liver regains its lost mass. The interplay of cytokines and growth factors responsible for the inception and termination of this hyperplasia is not well understood. A model is developed for this network of interactions based on the known data of liver resections. This model reproduces the relevant published data on liver regeneration and provides geometric insights into the experimental observations. The predictions of this model are used to suggest two novel strategies for speeding up liver mass recovery and a strategy for enabling liver mass recovery in cases where a resection leaves <20% of the liver that would otherwise result in complete loss of liver mass.,True,_PCQHEsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,58,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349509006110,14223895675682793000,/scholar?cites=14223895675682793000,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349509006110,0,0,0

Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas immune systems defend against phage infection by using Cas nucleases and small RNA guides that specify one or more target sites for cleavage of the viral genome 2. 3.

Conjugative elements have been instrumental in many bacterial species to face the threat of antibiotics. by allowing them to evolve and adapt to these hostile conditions. Conjugative plasmids are transferred to plasmidless recipient cells as single-stranded DNA. We used lacZ and gfp fusions to address whether conjugation induces the SOS response and the integron integrase. The SOS response controls a series of genes responsible for DNA damage repair. which can lead to recombination and mutagenesis. In this manuscript. we show that conjugative transfer of ssDNA induces the bacterial SOS stress response. unless an anti-SOS factor is present to alleviate this response. We also show that integron integrases are up-regulated during this process. resulting in increased cassette rearrangements. Moreover. the data we obtained using broad and narrow host range plasmids strongly suggests that plasmid transfer. even abortive. can trigger chromosomal gene rearrangements and transcriptional switches in the recipient cell.

The specificity of Cas9 can be reprogrammed to cleave desired sequences in a cell's chromosome simply by changing the sequence of a small guide RNA. Unlike in most eukaryotes. Cas9 cleavage in the chromosome of bacteria has been reported to kill the cell. However. the mechanism of cell death remains to be investigated. Bacteria mainly rely on homologous recombination (HR) with sister chromosomes to repair double strand breaks. Here. we show that the simultaneous cleavage of all copies of the Escherichia coli chromosome at the same position cannot be repaired. leading to cell death.

1103219,Innate and adaptive immunity in bacteria: mechanisms of programmed genetic variation to fight bacteriophages,2012,David Bikard and Luciano A Marraffini,24,,1,15-20,Elsevier Current Trends,Bacteria are constantly challenged by bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). the most abundant microorganism on earth. Bacteria have evolved a variety of immunity mechanisms to resist bacteriophage infection. In response. bacteriophages can evolve counter-resistance mechanisms and launch a ‘virus versus host’ evolutionary arms race. In this context. rapid evolution is fundamental for the survival of the bacterial cell. Programmed genetic variation mechanisms at loci involved in immunity against bacteriophages generate diversity at a much faster rate than random point mutation and enable bacteria to quickly adapt and repel infection. Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) and phase variation mechanisms enhance the generic (innate) immune response against bacteriophages.

This effect occurs at high dCas9 concentrations and can be alleviated by tuning the expression of dCas9 while maintaining strong on-target repression.

A fundamental requirement of any immune system is the ability to build a memory of past infections in order to deal more efficiently with recurrent infections. The adaptive feature of CRISPR‐Cas immune systems relies on their ability to memorize DNA sequences of invading molecules and integrate them in between the repetitive sequences of the CRISPR array in the form of ‘spacers’. The transcription of a spacer generates a small antisense RNA that is used by RNA‐guided Cas nucleases to cleave the invading nucleic acid in order to protect the cell from infection.

The catalytic null mutant of the Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease (dCas9) can be conveniently used to silence genes of interest in a method also known as CRISPRi. Here. we report a genome-wide CRISPR-dCas9 screen using a starting pool of ~ 92.000 sgRNAs which target random positions in the chromosome of E. coli. To benchmark our method. we first investigate its utility to predict gene essentiality in the genome of E. coli during growth in rich medium. We could identify 79% of the genes previously reported as essential and demonstrate the non-essentiality of some genes annotated as essential. In addition. we took advantage of the intermediate repression levels obtained when targeting the template strand of genes to show that cells are very sensitive to the expression level of a limited set of essential genes.

The lack of sequence conservation among attC sites led us to hypothesize that sequence-independent structural recognition determinants must exist within attC sites. The structural data obtained from a synaptic complex of the Vibrio cholerae integrase with the bottom strand of an attC site has shown the importance of extra helical bases (EHB) inside the stem-loop structure formed from the bottom strand. Here. we systematically determined the contribution of three structural elements common to all known single-stranded attC site recombination substrates (the EHBs. the unpaired central spacer (UCS). and the variable terminal structure (VTS)) to strand choice and recombination. Their roles have been evaluated in vivo in the attI×attC reaction context using the suicide conjugation assay we previously developed. but also in an attC×attC reaction using a deletion assay. Conjugation was used to deliver the attC sites in single-stranded form. Our results show that strand choice is primarily directed by the first EHB. but the presence of the two other EHBs also serves to increase this strand selection. We found that the structure of the central spacer is essential to achieve high level recombination of the bottom strand. suggesting a dual role for this structure in active site exclusion and for hindering the reverse reaction after the first strand exchange.

Furthermore. the presence of Veillonella has been associated with the development of a healthy immune system in infants. Veillonella belongs to the Negativicutes. a diverse clade of bacteria that represent an evolutionary enigma: they phylogenetically belong to Gram-positive (monoderm) Firmicutes yet maintain an outer membrane (OM) with lipopolysaccharide similar to classic Gram-negative (diderm) bacteria. The OMs of Negativicutes have unique characteristics including the replacement of Braun’s lipoprotein by OmpM for tethering the OM to the peptidoglycan. Through phylogenomic analysis. we have recently provided bioinformatic annotation of the Negativicutes diderm cell envelope. We showed that it is a unique type of envelope that was present in the ancestor of present-day Firmicutes and lost multiple times independently in this phylum. giving rise to the monoderm architecture; however. little experimental data is presently available for any Negativicutes cell envelope.

ABIN2 and TPL2 is essential for the host cell response to pathogens. The matrix protein (M) of field isolates of rabies virus was previously shown to disturb the signaling induced by RelAp43. a NF-κB protein close to RelA/p65. Here. we investigated how the M protein disturbs the NF-κB pathway in a RelAp43-dependant manner and the potential involvement of the ternary complex in this mechanism. Using a tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry approach. we show that RelAp43 interacts with the p105-ABIN2-TPL2 complex and we observe a strong perturbation of this complex in presence of M protein. M protein interaction with RelAp43 is associated with a wide disturbance of NF-κB signaling. involving a modulation of IκBα-. IκBβ-. and IκBε-RelAp43 interaction and a favored interaction of RelAp43 with the non-canonical pathway (RelB and p100/p52). Monitoring the interactions between host and viral proteins using protein-fragment complementation assay and bioluminescent resonance energy transfer. we further show that RelAp43 is associated to the p105-ABIN2-TPL2 complex as RelAp43-p105 interaction stabilizes the formation of a complex with ABIN2 and TPL2. Interestingly. the M protein interacts not only with RelAp43 but also with TPL2 and ABIN2. Upon interaction with this complex. M protein promotes the release of ABIN2. which ultimately favors the production of RelAp43-p50 NF-κB dimers.

For certain infectious diseases. such as tuberculosis. cryptococcosis. histoplasmosis. latent infection is a corollary of this dormant state. which has the risk for reactivation and clinical disease. During murine cryptococcosis and macrophage uptake. stress and host immunity induce Cryptococcus neoformans heterogeneity with the generation of a sub-population of yeasts that manifests a phenotype compatible with dormancy (low stress response. latency of growth). In this subpopulation. mitochondrial transcriptional activity is regulated and this phenotype has been considered as a hallmark of quiescence in stem cells. Based on these findings. we worked to reproduce this phenotype in vitro and then standardize the experimental conditions to consistently generate this dormancy in C. neoformans. We found that incubation of stationary phase yeasts (STAT) in nutriment limited conditions and hypoxia for 8 days (8D-HYPOx) was able to produced cells that mimic the phenotype obtained in vivo. In these conditions. mortality and/or apoptosis occurred in less than 5% of the yeasts compared to 30–40% of apoptotic or dead yeasts upon incubation in normoxia (8D-NORMOx). Yeasts in 8D-HYPOx harbored a lower stress response. delayed growth and less that 1% of culturability on agar plates. suggesting that these yeasts are viable but non culturable cells (VBNC).

Controlling shape. orientation. and size of the pits is not trivial as. being metastable. they can significantly evolve during deposition/annealing. In this paper. we exploit a continuum model to explore the typical metastable pit morphologies that can be expected on Si(001). depending on the initial depth/shape. Evolution is predicted using a surface-diffusion model. formulated in a phase-field framework. and tackling surface-energy anisotropy. Results are shown to nicely reproduce typical metastable shapes reported in the literature. Moreover. long time scale evolutions of pit profiles with different depths are found to follow a similar kinetic pathway. The model is also exploited to treat the case of heteroepitaxial growth involving two materials characterized by different facets in their equilibrium Wulff’s shape.

This instability provides a generic route to grow defect-free crystals on curved surfaces.

The annealing takes place in an approximately axisymmetric tube furnace and improves the crystal quality due to a more homogeneous distribution of defects and dopants. For this purpose the crystal has to be heated up to a certain temperature. as fast as possible for economical reasons. The crucial point is to minimise thermally induced stresses during heating. For this optimisation an algorithm based on a reduced order model (ROM) of the heating process is developed. By the aid of this model-predictive control (MPC) algorithm the required time to achieve the annealing temperature was decreased by 30% while the thermoelastic stress in the crystal is reduced by 10% compared to a standard procedure.,True,o_jQba0AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,15,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022024800006667,15934833551560053940,/scholar?cites=15934833551560053940,,,0,0,0

This implies that suspensions of V. carteri have features similar to suspensions of sedimenting particles.

Whilst chemotaxis may dominate near the ovum. it is unclear which cues guide spermatozoa on their long journey towards the egg. Hypothesized mechanisms range from peristaltic pumping to temperature sensing and response to fluid flow variations (rheotaxis). but little is known quantitatively about them. We report the first quantitative study of mammalian sperm rheotaxis. using microfluidic devices to investigate systematically swimming of human and bull sperm over a range of physiologically relevant shear rates and viscosities. Our measurements show that the interplay of fluid shear. steric surface-interactions. and chirality of the flagellar beat leads to stable upstream spiralling motion of sperm cells. thus providing a generic and robust rectification mechanism to support mammalian fertilisation.

This has led to speculation that ultracold gases may be dark-energy analogues and also suggests the feasibility of heat engines with efficiencies larger than one. Here. we prove that all previous negative temperature claims and their implications are invalid as they arise from the use of an entropy definition that is inconsistent both mathematically and thermodynamically.

However. the dynamics by which a human sperm orients itself relative to an ambient flow is poorly understood. Here. we combine microfluidic experiments with mathematical modeling and 3D flagellar beat reconstruction to quantify the response of individual sperm cells in time-varying flow fields.

The reasons for this are twofold. First. thermodynamic variables are non-local quantities and therefore single out a preferred class of hyperplanes in spacetime. Second. there exist different ways of defining heat and work in relativistic systems and all of them seem equally plausible. These ambiguities have led. for example. to various proposals for the Lorentz-transformation law of temperature. However. traditional ‘isochronous’ formulations of relativistic thermodynamics are neither theoretically satisfactory nor experimentally feasible. Here. we demonstrate how these deficiencies can be resolved by defining thermodynamic quantities with respect to the backward-lightcone of an observation event.

Many bacterial species form biofilms. and their study has revealed them to be complex and diverse. The structural and physiological complexity of biofilms has led to the idea that they are coordinated and cooperative groups. analogous to multicellular organisms. We evaluate this idea by addressing the findings of microbiologists from the perspective of sociobiology. including theories of collective behavior (self-organization) and social evolution. This yields two main conclusions. First. the appearance of organization in biofilms can emerge without active coordination.

1103363,The evolution of quorum sensing in bacterial biofilms,2008,Carey D Nadell and Joao B Xavier and Simon A Levin and Kevin R Foster,6,PLoS Biol,1,e14,Public Library of Science,Bacteria have fascinating and diverse social lives. They display coordinated group behaviors regulated by quorum-sensing systems that detect the density of other bacteria around them. A key example of such group behavior is biofilm formation. in which communities of cells attach to a surface and envelope themselves in secreted polymers. Curiously. after reaching high cell density. some bacterial species activate polymer secretion. whereas others terminate polymer secretion. Here. we investigate this striking variation in the first evolutionary model of quorum sensing in biofilms. We use detailed individual-based simulations to investigate evolutionary competitions between strains that differ in their polymer production and quorum-sensing phenotypes. The benefit of activating polymer secretion at high cell density is relatively straightforward: secretion starts upon biofilm formation. allowing strains to push their lineages into nutrient-rich areas and suffocate neighboring cells. But why use quorum sensing to terminate polymer secretion at high cell density? We find that deactivating polymer production in biofilms can yield an advantage by redirecting resources into growth. but that this advantage occurs only in a limited time window. We predict. therefore. that down-regulation of polymer secretion at high cell density will evolve when it can coincide with dispersal events. but it will be disfavored in long-lived (chronic) biofilms with sustained competition among strains. Our model suggests that the observed variation in quorum-sensing behavior can be linked to the differing requirements of bacteria in chronic versus acute biofilm infections.

However. via strength in numbers and the expression of cooperative phenotypes. such cells can enormously impact their environments. Simple cooperative phenotypes appear to abound in the microbial world. but explaining their evolution is challenging because they are often subject to exploitation by rapidly growing. non-cooperative cell lines. Population spatial structure may be critical for this problem because it influences the extent of interaction between cooperative and non-cooperative individuals. It is difficult for cooperative cells to succeed in competition if they become mixed with non-cooperative cells. which can exploit the public good without themselves paying a cost. However. if cooperative cells are segregated in space and preferentially interact with each other. they may prevail. Here we use a multi-agent computational model to study the origin of spatial structure within growing cell groups. Our simulations reveal that the spatial distribution of genetic lineages within these groups is linked to a small number of physical and biological parameters. including cell growth rate. nutrient availability. and nutrient diffusivity. Realistic changes in these parameters qualitatively alter the emergent structure of cell groups. and thereby determine whether cells with cooperative phenotypes can locally and globally outcompete exploitative cells. We argue that cooperative and exploitative cell lineages will spontaneously segregate in space under a wide range of conditions and. therefore. that cellular cooperation may evolve more readily than naively …,True,sPvo448AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,306,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000716,11102547793539467428,/scholar?cites=11102547793539467428,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000716,0,0,0

The means by which public-good-producing bacteria avert exploitation in biofilm environments are largely unknown.

The secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). which bind bacterial collectives together. is ubiquitously associated with biofilm formation.

By studying Vibrio cholerae biofilms in microfluidic devices. we show that EPS-producing cells selectively benefit their clonemates and gain a dramatic advantage in competition against an isogenic EPS-deficient strain.

Here. we demonstrate that hydrodynamic flow and matrix organization interact to shape competitive dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Irrespective of initial frequency. in competition with matrix mutants. wild-type cells always increase in relative abundance in planar microfluidic devices under simple flow regimes. By contrast. in microenvironments with complex. irregular flow profiles – which are common in natural environments – wild-type matrix-producing and isogenic non-producing strains can coexist. This result stems from local obstruction of flow by wild-type matrix producers. which generates regions of near-zero shear that allow matrix mutants to locally accumulate. Our findings connect the evolutionary stability of matrix production with the hydrodynamics and spatial structure of the surrounding environment. providing a potential explanation for the variation in biofilm matrix secretion observed among bacteria in natural environments.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21855.001,True,sPvo448AAAAJ:DXE8ND7PrJAC,42,https://elifesciences.org/articles/21855,8311425744470906566,/scholar?cites=8311425744470906566,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/21855.pdf,0,0,0

Membrane-associated MreB filaments move around the rod circumference. helping to insert cell wall in the radial direction to reinforce rod shape. To understand how oriented MreB motion arises. we altered the shape of Bacillus subtilis. MreB motion is isotropic in round cells. and orientation is restored when rod shape is externally imposed. Stationary filaments orient within protoplasts. and purified MreB tubulates liposomes in vitro. orienting within tubes. Together. this demonstrates MreB orients along the greatest principal membrane curvature. a conclusion supported with biophysical modeling. We observed that spherical cells regenerate into rods in a local. self-reinforcing manner: rapidly propagating rods emerge from small bulges. exhibiting oriented MreB motion.

1103420,Nanoscale features of fibronectin fibrillogenesis depend on protein-substrate interaction and cytoskeleton structure,2005,Tilo Pompe and Lars Renner and Carsten Werner,88,Biophysical journal,1,527-534,Cell Press,Cell-reorganized fibronectin layers on polymer films providing a gradation of the binding strength between protein and substrate were analyzed by combined fluorescence and scanning force microscopy. The nanoscale fibronectin patterns exhibited paired parallel fibrils with characteristic spacings of 156. 233. 304. and 373 nm. These spacings depend on the interaction of fibronectin with the substrate: at enhanced fibronectin-substrate anchorage the cells form larger stress fibers. which are assembled by α-actinin cross-linked pairs of actin filaments subunits at the focal adhesions. A ubiquitous repeating unit of ∼71 nm was found within these characteristic distances. We conclude that the dimensions of the actin stress fibers reflect the binding strength of fibronectin to the polymer substrate and act—in turn—as a template for the reorganization of fibronectin into surface-bound nanofibrils with characteristic spacings …,True,kllIhfwAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,50,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349505731271,12482399059685528982,/scholar?cites=12482399059685528982,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349505731271,0,0,0

Fully hydrolyzed (maleic acid) chains of the copolymers with styrene. propene. and ethylene comonomers covalently bound to SiO2 substrates showed a “mushroom” swelling behavior at pH 7.4 with a layer thickness scaling of N3/5. Decreasing the environmental pH was found to induce a comonomer‐dependent shrinking or collapse of the immobilized polymers due to the change in ionization. From the swelling kinetics of non‐hydrolyzed chains. the time constants and characteristics of swelling and anhydride hydrolysis were determined and found to depend on the type of comonomer.

The formation of sLBMs was triggered by a transient reduction of the electrostatic repulsion between the polymer cushions and the lipid vesicles by lowering the solutionʼs pH to 4. Upon formation. the stability of the sLBMs was not affected by subsequent variations of the environmental pH. The degree of hydrophilicity and swelling of the anionic polymer cushions was found to determine both the kinetics of the membrane formation and the mobility of the lipid bilayer with lipid diffusion coefficients in the range from 0.26 to 2.6 µm2s− 1.

Despite their capability to create different sizes. a clonal population in a given environment maintains a uniform size across individual cells. Recent studies in eukaryotic and bacterial organisms showed that this homogeneity in cell size can be accomplished by growing a constant size between two cell cycle events (that is. the adder model 2. 3. 4. 5. 6). Demonstration of the adder model led to the hypothesis that this phenomenon is a consequence of convergent evolution. Given that archaeal cells share characteristics with both bacteria and eukaryotes. we investigated whether and how archaeal cells exhibit control over cell size.

First. we created microchannels in a layer of agarose to reshape live bacterial cells and predictably control their mean cell wall curvature. and quantified the influence of curvature on the localization and distribution of proteins in vivo. Second. we used agarose microchambers to reshape bacteria whose cell wall had been chemically and enzymatically removed. By combining microstructures with different geometries and fluorescence microscopy. we determined the relationship between bacterial shape and the localization for two different membrane-associated proteins: i) the cell-shape related protein MreB of Escherichia coli. which is positioned along the long axis of the rod-shaped cell; and ii) the negative curvature-sensing cell division protein DivIVA of Bacillus subtilis. which is positioned primarily at cell division sites. Our studies of intracellular organization in live cells of E. coli and B. subtilis demonstrate that MreB is largely excluded from areas of high negative curvature. whereas DivIVA localizes preferentially to regions of high negative curvature.

Polymer cushioned SLBs can overcome this by avoiding direct contact with the support. To extend this approach we developed an anionic polymer cushion system that allows tunable lipid mobility as well as functional integration of the transmembrane protein β-amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) into SLBs. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis revealed a homogeneous distribution and high lateral mobility of the reconstituted BACE in cushioned SLBs while an impaired mobility and inhomogeneous clustering of reconstituted BACE were found in SLBs on silicon oxide substrates.

Therefore. the mechanism by which the mammalian embryo organizes its microtubules (MTs) is unclear. We visualize MT bridges connecting pairs of cells and show that the cytokinetic bridge does not undergo stereotypical abscission after cell division. Instead. it serves as scaffold for the accumulation of the MT minus-end–stabilizing protein CAMSAP3 throughout interphase. thereby transforming this structure into a noncentrosomal MTOC.

In addition to its critical role in the structural integrity of the embryo. we discuss here how adhesion is important to regulate cell polarity and cell fate. Recent evidence suggests that adherens junctions participate in signaling pathways by localizing key proteins to subcellular microdomains. E-cadherin has been identified as the main player required for the establishment of adhesion but other mechanisms involving additional proteins or physical forces acting in the embryo may also contribute.

Characterized by the transformation of the embryo from a loose cluster of spherical cells into a tightly packed mass. compaction is a key step in the establishment of the first tissue-like structures of the embryo. Although early investigation of the mechanisms driving compaction implicated changes in cell–cell adhesion. recent work has identified essential roles for cortical tension and a compaction-specific class of filopodia. During the transition from 8 to 16 cells. as the embryo is compacting. it must also make fundamental decisions regarding cell position. polarity. and fate. Understanding how these and other processes are integrated with compaction requires further investigation.

In many organisms. asymmetrically inherited fate determinants drive lineage specification 2. but this is not thought to be the case during early mammalian development. Here we show that intermediate filaments assembled by keratins function as asymmetrically inherited fate determinants in the mammalian embryo. Unlike F-actin or microtubules. keratins are the first major components of the cytoskeleton that display prominent cell-to-cell variability. triggered by heterogeneities in the BAF chromatin-remodelling complex.

1103502,Probing the spatio-temporal organizations and dynamics of gene expression and DNA replication in the mammalian cell nucleus,2015,Ziqing Zhao,,,,,,The nucleus is an organelle of central importance to the mammalian cell. However. our understanding of the organizations and dynamics of many nuclear structures and processes remains inadequate. largely due to the difficulty in probing them in situ. with single-molecule sensitivity as well as ultra-high resolutions in space and time. In this dissertation. we develop approaches to interrogate. through imaging and modeling. the spatio-temporal organizations and dynamics of two key nuclear processes: gene expression and DNA replication. We first describe a novel fluorescence imaging technique. named reflected light-sheet (RLS) microscopy. that is capable of detecting single molecules with superior signal-to-background ratio inside the mammalian nucleus. By selectively illuminating only a thin section of the nucleus using a light-sheet reflected off a miniature mirror. RLS microscopy combines the capabilities of 3D optical sectioning. fast imaging speed. and applicability to single. normal-sized adherent cells. As demonstration. we apply RLS microscopy to directly monitor the DNA binding dynamics and spatio-temporal colocalization of single mammalian transcription factor molecules in live cells.

While differences in morphology define neuronal cell types and may underlie neurological disorders. very little is known about influences of stochastic ion channel gating in neurons with complex morphology. We introduce and validate new computational tools that enable efficient generation and simulation of models containing stochastic ion channels distributed across dendritic and axonal membranes. Comparison of five morphologically distinct neuronal cell types reveals that when all simulated neurons contain identical densities of stochastic ion channels. the amplitude of stochastic membrane potential fluctuations differs between cell types and depends on sub-cellular location. For typical neurons. the amplitude of membrane potential fluctuations depends on channel kinetics as well as open probability. Using a detailed model of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron. we show that when intrinsic ion channels gate stochastically. the probability of initiation of dendritic or somatic spikes by dendritic synaptic input varies continuously between zero and one. whereas when ion channels gate deterministically. the probability is either zero or one. At physiological firing rates. stochastic gating of dendritic ion channels almost completely accounts for probabilistic somatic and dendritic spikes generated by the fully stochastic model.

1103524,Intrinsic electrophysiological properties of entorhinal cortex stellate cells and their contribution to grid cell firing fields,2012,Hugh Pastoll and Helen Ramsden and Matthew Francis Nolan,6,Frontiers in neural circuits,,17,Frontiers,The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is an increasingly important focus for investigation of mechanisms for spatial representation. Grid cells found in layer II of the MEC are likely to be stellate cells. which form a major projection to the dentate gyrus. Entorhinal stellate cells are distinguished by distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties. but how these properties contribute to representation of space is not yet clear. Here. we review the ionic conductances. synaptic and excitable properties of stellate cells. and examine their implications for models of grid firing fields. We discuss why existing data are inconsistent with models of grid fields that require stellate cells to generate periodic oscillations. An alternative possibility is that the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of stellate cells are tuned specifically to control integration of synaptic input. We highlight recent evidence that the dorsal-ventral organization of synaptic integration by stellate cells. through differences in currents mediated by HCN and leak potassium channels. influences the corresponding organization of grid fields. Because accurate cellular data will be important for distinguishing mechanisms for generation of grid fields. we introduce new data comparing properties measured with whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp recordings.

HCN1 channels are the major contributors to Ih. the hyperpolarization-activated current. which regulates the intrinsic properties of neurons and shapes their integration of synaptic inputs. paces rhythmic activity. and regulates synaptic plasticity. Here. we examine the physiological role of Ih in deep layer pyramidal neurons in mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC). focusing on persistent activity. a form of sustained firing thought to be important for the behavioral function of the PFC during working memory tasks. We find that HCN1 contributes to the intrinsic persistent firing that is induced by a brief depolarizing current stimulus in the presence of muscarinic agonists.

Unless Ca2+ influx mechanisms and spine volume scale proportionally. changes in spine size will modify spine Ca2+ concentrations during subsequent synaptic activation. We show that the relationship between Ca2+ influx and spine volume is a fundamental determinant of synaptic stability. If Ca2+ influx is undercompensated for increases in spine size. then strong synapses are stabilized and synaptic strength distributions have a single peak. In contrast. overcompensation of Ca2+ influx leads to binary. persistent synaptic strengths with double-peaked distributions. Biophysical simulations predict that CA1 pyramidal neuron spines are undercompensating. This unifies experimental findings that weak synapses are more plastic than strong synapses. that synaptic strengths are unimodally …,True,fp24gHYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,56,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/45/16142.short,9098842762534105644,/scholar?cites=9098842762534105644,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/31/45/16142.full.pdf,0,0,0

Although it is well established that individual ion channel proteins make stochastic transitions between conducting and non-conducting states. most models of synaptic integration are deterministic. and relatively little is known about the functional consequences of interactions between stochastically gating ion channels. Here. we show that a model of stellate neurons from layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex implemented with either stochastic or deterministically gating ion channels can reproduce the resting membrane properties of stellate neurons. but only the stochastic version of the model can fully account for perithreshold membrane potential fluctuations and clustered patterns of spike output that are recorded from stellate neurons during depolarized states. We demonstrate that the stochastic model implements an example of a general mechanism for patterning of neuronal output through activity-dependent changes in the probability of spike firing. Unlike deterministic mechanisms that generate spike patterns through slow changes in the state of model parameters. this general stochastic mechanism does not require retention of information beyond the duration of a single spike and its associated afterhyperpolarization. Instead. clustered patterns of spikes emerge in the stochastic model of stellate neurons as a result of a transient increase in firing probability driven by activation of HCN channels during recovery from the spike afterhyperpolarization.

Within the MEC spatial representations. including grid and directional firing fields. have a laminar and dorsoventral organization that corresponds to a similar topography of neuronal connectivity and cellular properties. Yet. in part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the resolution of cortical layers and borders. we know little about the molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution. We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16.000 genes in the Allen Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-. cell adhesion- and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC.

However. principles relating gamma oscillations. synaptic strength and circuit computations are unclear. We address this in attractor network models that account for grid firing and theta-nested gamma oscillations in the medial entorhinal cortex. We show that moderate intrinsic noise massively increases the range of synaptic strengths supporting gamma oscillations and grid computation. With moderate noise. variation in excitatory or inhibitory synaptic strength tunes the amplitude and frequency of gamma activity without disrupting grid firing. This beneficial role for noise results from disruption of epileptic-like network states. Thus. moderate noise promotes independent control of multiplexed firing rate- and gamma-based computational mechanisms.

In this Review. we discuss the issue of sequencing depth in the design of next-generation sequencing experiments. We review current guidelines and precedents on the issue of coverage. as well as their underlying considerations. for four major study designs. which include de novo genome sequencing. genome resequencing. transcriptome sequencing and genomic location analyses (for example. chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) and chromosome conformation capture (3C)).,True,cwT02HYAAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC,1110,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3642,15039934693375770790,/scholar?cites=15039934693375770790,,http://www.rnaseqforthenextgeneration.org/files/resources/Seq_depth_coverage_SimsETAL_2014.pdf,0,0,0

While differences in morphology define neuronal cell types and may underlie neurological disorders. very little is known about influences of stochastic ion channel gating in neurons with complex morphology. We introduce and validate new computational tools that enable efficient generation and simulation of models containing stochastic ion channels distributed across dendritic and axonal membranes. Comparison of five morphologically distinct neuronal cell types reveals that when all simulated neurons contain identical densities of stochastic ion channels. the amplitude of stochastic membrane potential fluctuations differs between cell types and depends on sub-cellular location. For typical neurons. the amplitude of membrane potential fluctuations depends on channel kinetics as well as open probability. Using a detailed model of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron. we show that when intrinsic ion channels gate stochastically. the probability of initiation of dendritic or somatic spikes by dendritic synaptic input varies continuously between zero and one. whereas when ion channels gate deterministically. the probability is either zero or one. At physiological firing rates. stochastic gating of dendritic ion channels almost completely accounts for probabilistic somatic and dendritic spikes generated by the fully stochastic model.

In contrast. overcompensation of Ca2+ influx leads to binary. persistent synaptic strengths with double-peaked distributions.

There is no agreement. even in theoretical studies. on which ion channel type is the dominant noise source. nor how inclusion of additional ion channel types affects voltage noise.

1103619,Tuning of synaptic responses: an organizing principle for optimization of neural circuits,2011,Cian O’Donnell and Matthew F Nolan,34,,2,51-60,Elsevier Current Trends,Neuron types are classically defined by anatomical and physiological properties that determine how synaptic inputs are integrated. Here. we provide an overview of the evidence that. among neurons of a single type. integration of synaptic responses is further tuned according to the particular function that individual neurons carry out. Recent data suggest that tuning of synaptic responses is not restricted to sensory pathways. but extends to cognitive and motor circuits. We propose that tuning of synaptic integration results from general cellular mechanisms for optimization of information processing that are distinct from. but complementary to. homeostasis and memory storage. These cellular tuning mechanisms might be crucial for distributed computations underlying sensory. motor and cognitive functions.,True,KGKHB2QAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,29,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223610001529,12551807718875910488,/scholar?cites=12551807718875910488,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.706.1076&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The biggest challenge comes from the fact that the number of possible network activity patterns scales exponentially with the number of neurons recorded (). Here we introduce a new statistical method for characterizing neural population activity that requires semi-independent fitting of only as many parameters as the square of the number of neurons. requiring drastically smaller data sets and minimal computation time. The model works by matching the population rate (the number of neurons synchronously active) and the probability that each individual neuron fires given the population rate.

1103625,Adaptive estimators show information compression in deep neural networks,2019,Ivan Chelombiev and Conor Houghton and Cian O'Donnell,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09037,,,,To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However. empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting. as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast. networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques. that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions. especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques. we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation. firstly. we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression. and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary. we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression. while preventing overfitting. Finally. we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.,True,KGKHB2QAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,14,https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09037,2654288184895561029,/scholar?cites=2654288184895561029,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09037,0,0,0

Although these ion channels are well known to operate stochastically. most computational models of dendritic neurons instead make the approximation that ionic conductances are deterministic. We review the basic mathematical considerations underlying this approximation and new efficient simulation tools that allow it to be evaluated systematically. We show how this approximation breaks down for dendritic neurons. with the relative functional influence of stochastic ion channel gating likely to depend strongly on neuron type.

We reveal that this model predicts an unavoidable and physiologically critical tradeoff between speed and precision of cargo delivery that can be tested experimentally.

1103636,The population tracking model: A simple. scalable,,Cian O’Donnell and J Tiago Gonçalves and Nick Whiteley and Carlos Portera-Cailliau5and Terrence J Sejnowski,,,,,,Brains encode and process information as electrical activity over populations of their neurons (Churchland 24 and Sejnowski. 1994; Averbeck et al.. 2006). Although understanding the structure of this neural code has 25 long been a central goal of neuroscience. historical progress has been impeded by limitations in recording 26 techniques. Traditional extracellular recording electrodes allowed isolation of only one or a few neurons at 27 a time (Stevenson and Kording. 2011). Given that the human brain has on the order of 1011 neurons. the 28 contribution of such small groups of neurons to brain processing is likely minimal.

Although 30 the ideal scenario—recording every neuron in the brain—is out of reach for now. recent developments in 31 both electrical and optical recording technologies have increased the typical size of population recording so 32 that many laboratories now routinely record from hundreds or even thousands of neurons (Stevenson and 33 Kording. 2011).

1103639,In vivo wall shear measurements within the developing zebrafish heart,2013,R Aidan Jamison and Chaminda R Samarage and Robert J Bryson-Richardson and Andreas Fouras,8,PloS one,10,e75722,Public Library of Science,Physical forces can influence the embryonic development of many tissues. Within the cardiovascular system shear forces resulting from blood flow are known to be one of the regulatory signals that shape the developing heart. A key challenge in investigating the role of shear forces in cardiac development is the ability to obtain shear force measurements in vivo. Utilising the zebrafish model system we have developed a methodology that allows the shear force within the developing embryonic heart to be determined. Accurate wall shear measurement requires two essential pieces of information; high-resolution velocity measurements near the heart wall and the location and orientation of the heart wall itself. We have applied high-speed brightfield imaging to capture time-lapse series of blood flow within the beating heart between 3 and 6 days post-fertilization. Cardiac-phase filtering is applied to these time-lapse images to remove the heart wall and other slow moving structures leaving only the red blood cell movement. Using particle image velocimetry to calculate the velocity of red blood cells in different regions within the heart. and using the signal-to-noise ratio of the cardiac-phase filtered images to determine the boundary of blood flow. and therefore the position of the heart wall. we have been able to generate the necessary information to measure wall shear in vivo. We describe the methodology required to measure shear in vivo and the application of this technique to the developing zebrafish heart.

An extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted to investigate hybrid averaging and evaluate it against both vector and correlation averaging. The simulations show that hybrid averaging improves the measurement accuracy over both correlation and vector averaging over a wide range of imaging conditions. The simulations are validated by applying hybrid averaging to experimental micro- and macro-flows. In pulsatile conditions. correlation averaging yields an averaged correlation function that is multi-modal. which can result in unpredictable measurements.

On a global scale. lung tissue compensation. by surrounding healthy lung tissue. is the largest obstacle that exists in improving the sensitivity of current techniques. The aggregation of lung function measures between diseased and healthy compensating regions in to single measures. delays disease detection and impacts patient care.Methods: Here we present results from an animal case study where 4Dx technology [1. 2] was applied to assess the effects of lung disease and compensation from adjacent healthy lung tissue. The study was conducted on two mechanically ventilated rabbit pups. A left-sided Diaphragmatic Hernia (DH) was surgically induced on the first pup while the second pup was a healthy littermate. Both animals were age and weight matched. 4DxV and associated technologies have been previously applied to multiple preclinical animal models [1. 3. 4] yielding regional measures for lung tissue ventilation and airflow. We associate these 4D ventilation measures with a segmented airway tree structure [1. 3]. allowing the measurement of both compliance and airflow on a lobar basis.Results: Regional volume measures from 4Dx technology were aggregated at both a global and a regional level. Global aggregation mimics measures typically obtained with existing techniques while local aggregation is used to obtain regional functional measures.

The imaging provides a displacement vector field for the entire 3D lung parenchyma. thus providing the ability to measure the tidal volume on a regional level (see panel A). Measurements of the pulmonary vasculature were obtained by applying a filter that detects tubular structures in the 3D image (panel B).ResultsDifference in tissue patterns in the CT slices after 5 hours mechanical ventialtion were consistent with tissue injury (panels C. D). Although there was no evidence of change in global lung tissue expansion (ie tidal volume). regional contours showed decreases (relative to maximum) post‐ventilation (panels E. F).

PEs require rapid diagnosis and treatment and a definitive diagnosis is made through imaging. Contrast-enhanced CT angiography has rapidly replaced ventilation-perfusion scanning as the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing PE. especially with the advent of multi-detector CT scanners that allow analysis of the pulmonary arteries and detection of emboli at the sub-segmental level. However. CT angiography can cause contrast medium-induced nephropathy (CIN). which is the third most common cause of in-hospital acute renal failure. conferring significant morbidity and mortality.

Here. we provide evidence for a new paradigm for the determinants of migration destination. As adults. sea turtles show fidelity to their natal nesting areas and then at the end of the breeding season may migrate to distant foraging sites. For a major rookery in the Mediterranean. we simulated hatchling drift by releasing 288 000 numerical particles in an area close to the nesting beaches. We show that the pattern of adult dispersion from the breeding area reflects the extent of passive dispersion that would be experienced by hatchlings. Hence. the prevailing oceanography around nesting areas may be crucial to the selection of foraging sites used by adult sea turtles. This environmental forcing may allow the rapid evolution of new migration destinations if ocean currents alter with climate change.,True,JuAIkOoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,180,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsif.2010.0009,1769792169370310404,/scholar?cites=1769792169370310404,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894886/,0,0,0

The normal pattern involves movement from shallow depths at night to greater depths during the day. For many herbivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton that feed predominantly near the surface on phytoplankton and microzooplankton. minimising the risk of predation from fish seems to be the ultimate factor behind DVM.

Migrants are key components of biological systems in high latitude regions. where the speed and magnitude of climate change impacts are greatest. They also rely on highly productive seasonal habitats. including wetlands and ocean upwellings that. with climate change. may become less food-rich and predictable in space and time.

Only recently has work started to examine the possible relationships of these movements with dynamic oceanic features. and consequently a clear picture of such interaction is only available in a few cases.Newborn sea turtles are thought to rely on oceanic currents to reach their pelagic nursery habitats. The actual extent and timing of these developmental migrations are known for only a few populations. but these movements probably last several years and range over thousands of km. Large juveniles that have been tracked during their pelagic stage were found to make long‐distance movements. sometimes swimming against the prevailing currents. Older juveniles of most species leave the pelagic habitat to recruit to neritic developmental habitats.

Recent analyses of multidecadal data sets have shown such monotonic shifts in the distribution of plankton communities and various fish species. both groups for which there is a large amount of historical data on distribution. However. establishing the implications of climate change for the range of endangered species is problematic as historic data are often lacking.

Large levels of inter-annual variation in the number of nesting females have been well documented in green turtle nesting populations and may be linked to environmental conditions. Other species of marine turtle exhibit less variation in nesting numbers. This inter-specific difference is thought to be linked to trophic status. To examine whether individual reproductive output is more variable in the herbivorous green turtle (Chelonia mydas Linneaeus 1758) than the carnivorous loggerhead (Caretta caretta Linneaeus 1758). we examined the nesting of both species in Cyprus over nine seasons.

Extant species of marine turtles probably arose during the mid–late Jurassic period (180–150 Mya) so have survived past shifts in climate. including glacial periods and warm events and therefore have some capacity for adaptation. The present-day rates of increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. and associated temperature changes. are very rapid; the capacity of marine turtles to adapt to this rapid change may be compromised by their relatively long generation times.

However. there has been no global synthesis of patterns of gelatinous zooplankton biomass (GZB). an important first step in determining any future trends. A meta-analysis of epipelagic-GZB patterns was undertaken. encompassing 58 locations on a global scale. and spanning the years 1967–2009. Epipelagic-GZB decreased strongly with increasing total water column depth (r2 = 0.543. p < 0.001. n = 58): in shallow (<50 m) coastal waters. epipelagic-GZB was typically 742× the levels in deep ocean (>2.000 m) sites.

Bloom forming species. due to their high densities. can have particularly intense trophic and socio-economic impacts. In northern Europe it is known that one particularly large (up to 30 kg wet weight) bloom forming jellyfish is Rhizostoma spp. Given the potential importance. we set out to review all known records from peer-reviewed and broader public literature of the jellyfish R. octopus (Linnaeus) and R. pulmo (Macri) (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomae) across western Europe. These data revealed distinct hotspots where regular Rhizostoma spp. aggregations appeared to form. with other sites characterized by occasional abundances and a widespread distribution of infrequent observations. Surveys of known R. octopus hotspots around the Irish Sea also revealed marked inter-annual variation with particularly high abundances forming during 2003.

Consequently. this will affect several important results deduced from the analysis of tracking data. such as the evaluation of the orientation skills and the energy budget of animals or the identification of foraging areas.

Here. we provide evidence for a new paradigm for the determinants of migration destination. As adults. sea turtles show fidelity to their natal nesting areas and then at the end of the breeding season may migrate to distant foraging sites. For a major rookery in the Mediterranean. we simulated hatchling drift by releasing 288 000 numerical particles in an area close to the nesting beaches. We show that the pattern of adult dispersion from the breeding area reflects the extent of passive dispersion that would be experienced by hatchlings. Hence. the prevailing oceanography around nesting areas may be crucial to the selection of foraging sites used by adult sea turtles.

Yet this strategy may be energetically costly. and therefore challenging. during this period of already high‐energy demand.2. Here. the 6‐week deployment of tri‐axial accelerometers (n = 6) on a marine ectotherm. the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta). reproducing at the northern limit of the species’ breeding range (i.e. in a thermally dynamic environment) revealed the behavioural mechanisms underlying its energy management strategy during the breeding season.3. The estimated activity levels of female loggerheads using overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) were high during the breeding season. suggesting that marine turtles may not be able to remain inactive for long periods in the same manner as terrestrial ectotherms. because of the thermally dynamic nature of their environment.4 …,True,hXCSt_wAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,74,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01960.x,3158178372831212208,/scholar?cites=3158178372831212208,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01960.x,0,0,0
