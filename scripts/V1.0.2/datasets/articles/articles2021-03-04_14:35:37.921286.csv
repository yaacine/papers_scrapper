1122331,Supramolecular hydrogelators and hydrogels: from soft matter to molecular biomaterials,2015,Xuewen Du and Jie Zhou and Junfeng Shi and Bing Xu,115,,24,13165-13307,American Chemical Society,In this review we intend to provide a relatively comprehensive summary of the work of supramolecular hydrogelators after 2004 and to put emphasis particularly on the applications of supramolecular hydrogels/hydrogelators as molecular biomaterials. After a brief introduction of methods for generating supramolecular hydrogels. we discuss supramolecular hydrogelators on the basis of their categories. such as small organic molecules. coordination complexes. peptides. nucleobases. and saccharides. Following molecular design. we focus on various potential applications of supramolecular hydrogels as molecular biomaterials. classified by their applications in cell cultures. tissue engineering. cell behavior. imaging. and unique applications of hydrogelators. Particularly. we discuss the applications of supramolecular hydrogelators after they form supramolecular assemblies but prior to reaching the critical gelation …,True,TV-FlRoAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,992,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00299,4363467002383101537,/scholar?cites=4363467002383101537,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00299,0,0,0

But lack of a convenient approach for studying the self-assembly of small molecules inside cells hinders the development of such systems. Here we report a method to image enzyme-triggered self-assembly of small molecules inside live cells. After linking a fluorophore to a self-assembly motif to make a precursor. we confirmed by 31 P NMR and rheology that enzyme-triggered conversion of the precursor to a hydrogelator results in the formation of a hydrogel via self-assembly. The imaging contrast conferred by the nanofibres of the hydrogelators allowed the evaluation of intracellular self-assembly. the dynamics and the localization of the nanofibres of the hydrogelators in live cells.

Thus. it is beneficial to develop topical gels that selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) for the management of local inflammation. In this work. we demonstrate that the covalent conjugation of d-amino acids to naproxen (i.e.. a NSAID) not only affords supramolecular hydrogelators for the topical gels but also unexpectedly and significantly elevates the selectivity toward COX-2 about 20× at little expense of the activity of naproxen.

However. selective formation of xenogenous nanofibrils of small molecules on mammalian cells has yet to be observed.

The covalent linkage of Phe–Phe and NSAIDs results in conjugates that self-assemble in water to form molecular nanofibers as the matrices of hydrogels. When the NSAID is naproxen (1). the resultant hydrogelator 1a forms a hydrogel at a critical concentration (cgc) of 0.2 wt% at pH 7.0. Hydrogelator 1a. also acting as a general motif. enables enzymatic hydrogelation in which the precursor turns into a hydrogelator upon hydrolysis catalyzed by a phosphatase at physiological conditions.

Specifically. calcium ions allow interfiber cross-links among the supramolecular nanofibers of small peptides that consist of multiple carboxylic acid and aromatic groups. A small change in the concentration of calcium increases the elasticity of hydrogels over several orders of magnitude.

In principle it is a straightforward linear absorption spectroscopy. but it can be affected by artefacts that complicate the interpretation of the data. In this article. artefacts produced by the electric-field standing-wave (EFSW) in micro-reflection-absorption (transflection) spectroscopy are investigated. An EFSW is present at reflective metallic surfaces due to the interference of incident and reflected light. The period of this standing wave is dependent on the wavelength of the radiation and can produce non-linear changes in absorbance with increasing sample thickness (non-Beer–Lambert like behaviour).

The high temperatures (1.200–2.000 C) typical of jet engines exacerbate the impact of ash by provoking its melting and sticking to turbine parts.

Lattice dynamics of the hybrid framework at below 18 THz were measured by means of Raman and synchrotron far-infrared spectroscopy. and systematically correlated to collective vibrational modes computed from ab initio density functional theory (DFT). We have identified a number of intriguing low-energy framework vibration mechanisms. reminiscent of the ‘trampoline-like’ deformations and new oscillatory motions associated with Cu paddle-wheel ‘molecular rotors’.

The self-diffusion coefficient. D. of monodisperse poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) polymers has been determined in order to accurately determine the scaling behavior of D both with molecular weight and concentration. In order to investigate the influence of polydispersity on the PFG NMR signal. a model system consisting of ten reasonably monodisperse PEO polymers was made. and the PFG NMR signal intensities were recorded at a low total concentration. The data were analyzed using both inverse Laplace transformation and nonlinear least-squares fitting to a prescribed distribution function of D.

NMR self-diffusion studies showed that the average diffusion coefficients varied for asphaltenes from the different subfractions. The results suggest a variation in average size and stability between asphaltenes. depending on what subfraction they belong to.

An understanding of the mechanisms controlling the diffusion requires a deep understanding of structure-interaction-diffusion relationships. In cell biology. for instance. this applies to the movement of proteins and lipids in the plasma membrane. cytoplasm and nucleus. In industrial applications related to pharmaceutics. foods. textiles. hygiene products and cosmetics. the diffusion of solutes and solvent molecules contributes strongly to the properties and functionality of the final product. All these systems are heterogeneous. and accurate quantification of the mass transport processes at the local level is therefore essential to the understanding of the properties of soft (bio)materials. FRAP is a commonly used fluorescence microscopy-based technique to determine local molecular transport at the micrometer scale. A brief high-intensity laser pulse is locally applied to the sample. causing substantial photobleaching of the fluorescent molecules within the illuminated area. This causes a local concentration gradient of fluorescent molecules. leading to diffusional influx of intact fluorophores from the local surroundings into the bleached area. Quantitative information on the molecular transport can be extracted from the time evolution of the fluorescence recovery in the bleached area using a suitable model. A multitude of FRAP models has been developed over the years. each based on specific assumptions.

The problem is usually approached by the use of functional coatings and most of such antifouling coatings rely on the effect of biocides. However. a substantial drawback is the poor control over the release of the biocide as well as its degradation in the paint. Encapsulation of the biocides in microcapsules is a promising approach that may overcome some of the problems associated with the more traditional ways of incorporating the antifouling agent into the formulation. In this review. we summarize more than a decade of microcapsule research from our lab as well as from other groups working on this topic.

In this research. we report the growth of onion ring like three-dimensional (3D) graphene structures. which are comprised of concentric one-dimensional hexagonal graphene ribbon rings grown under 2D single-crystal monolayer graphene domains. The ring formation arises from the hydrogenation-induced edge nucleation and 3D growth of a new graphene layer on the edge and under the previous one. as supported by first principles calculations.

Extension of the basis set to include a second set of d functions (DZ+2P) on each atom. however. shows the SCF linear state to be a transition state and the C2v structure to be the minimum.

J,,15960-15963,,Catalytic dehydrocoupling of primary and secondary phosphines has been achieved for the first time using an iron pre-catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions and is successful with a range of diarylphosphines. A proton acceptor is not needed for the transformation to take place. but addition of 1-hexene does allow for turnover at 50 C. The catalytic system developed also facilitates the dehydrocoupling of phenylphosphane and dicyclohexylphosphane. A change in solvent switches off dehydrocoupling to allow hydrophosphination of alkenes.Catalytic dehydrocoupling (DHC) is an attractive and efficient method to synthesize P‒P bonds.[1] evolving H2 as the only byproduct. The resulting substrates are of great synthetic interest and have found a wide range of applications in coordination chemistry [2] and through further functionalization to produce a diverse range of P‒C [3] and P‒element bonds.[4] Although DHC to make P‒P bonds is less well explored than the P‒B. P‒N and N‒B counterparts. a handful of elegant examples mediated by a small selection of Platinum Group.[5] Group 4 [6] and main group catalysts [7] along with Lewis acid catalysts [8] and carbenes [9] exist.

In the present work a model for the gaseous sulfation of alkali hydroxide (AOH) and alkali chloride (ACl) is developed.

The present study investigates sulfate aerosol formation based on calculations with a detailed gas phase mechanism. The modeling predictions are compared to data from laboratory experiments and entrained flow reactor experiments available in the literature. The analysis support that alkali sulfate aerosols are formed from homogeneous nucleation following a series of steps occurring in the gas phase. The rate-limiting step may be the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. rather than the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 proposed previously.

In this system. each of the two Fe sites may be either in the high-spin (HS) or in the low-spin (LS) state. so that the molecule corresponds to a three-state system (LS–LS. HS–LS and HS–HS). At low temperature. the laser excitation wavelength controls the photoswitching from the stable LS–LS state to one of the metastable excited states (HS–LS or HS–HS). and also between these two excited states. Significant changes in the crystalline structure associated with the photoinduced change of spin state are detailed here.

Investigations were performed on the two crystalline polymorphs of the spin-crossover [Fe-(PM-BIA) 2 (NCS) 2] material. In addition to structural studies at thermal equilibrium. light-induced phenomena were investigated through photocrystallography. photomagnetic. and dynamical optical measurements. Strong similarities between the thermal-equilibrium and the out-of-equilibrium light-induced transformations are observed in each polymorph: strong cooperative phenomena in one polymorph versus weak cooperative ones in the second polymorph. These different responses of the two crystalline forms of the compound to external perturbations are discussed at the microscopic level in terms of Ising-like model and two-mode description of on-site molecular potentials.,True,5wXgJ0EAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC,55,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.85.064114,18130984768387668096,/scholar?cites=18130984768387668096,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00673256/document,0,0,0

The out-of-equilibrium dynamics involves several steps. resulting from the ultrafast molecular photoswitching of low-spin (LS) to high-spin (HS) states in solids. First. the transient HS state is reached within 200 fs. and may rapidly decay into the stable LS state of the system. A second process at longer delay. associated with volume expansion. drives additional conversion to the HS state during the so-called elastic step occurring at nanosecond time scale. Finally. the laser heating process induces a temperature jump in the crystal that may result in a significant thermal population of the HS state on microsecond time scale. The photoswitching mechanism is of local nature and has linear dependence on the …,True,5wXgJ0EAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C,53,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010854514001647,5969845413040188198,/scholar?cites=5969845413040188198,,https://hal-univ-rennes1.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/1005418/filename/Accept_MS.pdf,0,0,0

Strikingly. the methylene segment of the semifluorinated F8H11PA SAM never reaches an ordered state even at long assembly times. This contrasts with the ordered chains in equilibrium films from H16PA and H22PA. We attribute this behavior to steric effects of the fluorocarbon segment and the phosphonic acid headgroup.

Signal transduction is accomplished by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the NC and a fluorescent pH-sensitive squaraine dye attached to the surface of the NC. The efficiency of FRET. and consequently the relative intensity of NC and dye emissions. is modulated with the pH-dependent absorption cross section of the squaraine dye. The design of a NC sensor based on FRET results in a ratiometric sensor since the emission intensities of dye and NC may be referenced to the isosbestic point between NC and dye emissions. The ratiometric approach allows sensing to be performed. regardless of issues surrounding collection efficiency (scattering environment. light fluctuations. etc.) and dye:NC loadings. ,True,Hhv5F4kAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,597,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0618999,4121439304274712461,/scholar?cites=4121439304274712461,,,0,0,0

The dynamics of Fe(CO)5 in alcohols show that the coordination of the hydroxyl group of the solvent with triplet Fe(CO)4 is generally much faster than the coordination timescale observed with comparable singlet species. The physical reason for this is the fact that the metal C−H agostic bond is much weaker for triplets. thus allowing fast rearrangement to the hydroxyl group of the alcohol.

A central outstanding issue is the significance of interchain electronic species in films of these materials. In this paper. we investigate the nature of interchain species in films of poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1.4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) both before and after thermal annealing. Our investigation employs a combination of third harmonic generation (THG) and near-field scanning optical microscopy to measure the wavelength and spatial dependence of the THG efficiency. These chemically selective imaging measurements reveal new. low-energy absorption features in nanometer-scale spatially distinct regions of annealed films that are only infrequently observed prior to annealing.

Molecule L incorporates two squaramide functions in a overstructured chain connecting two opposite nitrogen atoms of the Me2 [12] aneN4 polyaza macrocyclic base to obtain a cage topology. The basicity and binding properties of L towards CuII were determined by means of potentiometric measurements in aqueous solution (298.1∆ 0.1 K. I= 0.15 mol dm¿ 3). Molecule L behaves as a diprotic base under the experimental conditions employed and forms only mononuclear CuII complexes in which the squaramide moieties are not involved in the stabilization of the metal ion that is stabilized by the amine functions of the polyaza base inside the three-dimensional cavity. The [CuL] 2+ species was tested as a host for the series of halide anions. UV-visible spectrophotometric experiments permitted the determination of the addition constants of halides to the CuII-complexed species. The [CuL] 2+ species binds the anions F¿. Cl¿. and Br¿ by forming the [CuLX]+ species. but does not bind the biggest I¿ anion. A trend of selectivity as a function of the hydrogen-bonding capability as well as the dimensions of the anion were established; the maximum value of selectivity was for addition of the F¿ anion (logK= 4.8). This selectivity is due to the presence of the overstructured chain containing the squaramide groups up to the Me2 [12] aneN4 macrocyclic base.

Hence. there is a need for development of more degradable or natural materials for use as a coloring agent for leathers. which would eco benign. Thus. the present study aims at extraction of color from Bixa orellana seeds and employing the same in dyeing and finishing of leather. The leathers dyed and finished using the natural dye extract showed better coloring properties.

There has been enough progress in resolution and sensitivity to justify the use of these materials. Polymer-bound PAG resists have shown that the principal demerit of acid diffusion can be overcome through attachment of the PAG anion to the lithographic polymer. Since the introduction of this chemically amplified resist approach. we have seen steady improvement in resolution. sensitivity. and LWR.

To discriminate between bound and unbound fluorescein-labeled 2′-O-methyl RNA probes. we use ionically coated gold nanoparticles to selectively adsorb unbound probes and quench their fluorescence. The target is the 3′ untranslated region of Bombyx mori R2 RNA. Fluorescence indicates that R2 sequences complementary to some of the probes are accessible for binding in the three-dimensional structure. Hybridization occurs under homogeneous conditions in the absence of the gold nanoparticles so that steric issues associated with chip-based assays are avoided. The assay is compatible with well plate formats. takes less than 5 min. and requires only 2 pmol or less of unlabeled target RNA per probe sequence tested.,True,2xKQl8EAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,22,https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/13/11/2034.short,4991752390790205689,/scholar?cites=4991752390790205689,,https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/13/11/2034.full.pdf,0,0,0

Typically. when a benzene solution of an isolable silylene is irradiated with light of wavelengths longer than 420 nm at room temperature. the corresponding silacyclohepta-2.4.6-triene (silepin) is yielded quantitatively. The photochemical insertion of the silylene toward substituted benzenes occurs in general to give the corresponding substituted silepins. The insertion reaction is highly sensitive to the steric hindrance at a reacting C−C double bond in benzene; during the reactions of the silylene with substituted benzenes. only unsubstituted C−C double bonds in the benzene ring reacted selectively.

1122934,Ionic strength effects on cation sorption to oxides: macroscopic observations and their significance in microscopic interpretation,1997,Johannes Lützenkirchen,195,Journal of colloid and interface science,1,149-155,Academic Press,Sorption of metal ions at oxide mineral–water interfaces is a complex process involving many possible variables. one of them being ionic strength. Depending on the system. adsorption of metal ions at these interfaces has been reported to increase or decrease with increasing ionic strength. However. in most cases it appears to be insensitive to ionic strength. Insensitivity to ionic strength has been taken as an indication for inner sphere surface complexation. Decrease of sorption with increasing ionic strength has been interpreted as outer sphere surface complexation. Promotive effects of ionic strength have not been discussed at all in terms of conventional surface complexation theory. The present paper shows that the classical example of Ba sorption to goethite. where increasing ionic strength decreases Ba adsorption. can be alternatively explained by an inner sphere mechanism if ion pair formation in solution …,True,q_vfkEQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,164,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979797951602,9397421625183085000,/scholar?cites=9397421625183085000,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46666359/jcis.1997.516020160621-10027-1bcc38e.pdf,0,0,0

Amorphous iron oxide and α-quartz,1995,Christophe Tiffreau and Johannes Lützenkirchen and Philippe Behra,172,Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,1,82-93,Academic Press,In this study. we provide a single model capable of describing the behavior of mercury (II) at two different solid/water interfaces. Mercury (II) sorption on amorphous ferric oxide (HFO) and α-SiO 2 can be simulated using the surface complexation approach. In both cases. experiments are best reproduced when ternary surface complexes between the surface (≡ S-OH 0). Hg 2+. OH-or Cl-are included in the model. Sorption or ternary surface complexes predominates in the case of α-SiO 2. In addition. in the case of HFO. additional precipitation reactions of a nonideal Hg (OH) 2-Fe (OH) 3 solid solution are needed at high sorbate to sorbent ratios.

Various assumptions with respect to the goethite morphology are considered in determining the site density of the surface functional groups. The results from the various model applications are not statistically significant in terms of goodness of fit. More importantly. various published assumptions with respect to the goethite morphology (i.e.. the contributions of different crystal planes and their repercussions on the “overall” site densities of the various surface functional groups) do not significantly affect the final model parameters within simple 1-pK approximations.

Here we sought to develop new G-quadruplex ligands to be exploited as antiviral compounds by enhancing binding toward the viral G-quadruplex structures. We synthesized naphthalene diimide derivatives with a lateral expansion of the aromatic core. The new compounds were able to bind/stabilize the G-quadruplex to a high extent. and some of them displayed clear-cut selectivity toward the viral G-quadruplexes with respect to the human telomeric G-quadruplexes. This feature translated into low nanomolar anti-HIV-1 activity toward two viral strains and encouraging selectivity indexes. The selectivity depended on specific recognition of LTR loop residues; the mechanism of action was ascribed to inhibition of LTR promoter activity in cells.

Metallic chromium/gold (Cr/Au) nanodots were first deposited onto the silicon wafer using an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template. The AAO template was then removed before a thin blanket layer of gold catalyst was evaporated onto the sample surface. The gold-assisted chemical wet etching was carried out in a solution consisting of deionized water. hydrogen peroxide. and hydrofluoric acid to produce well-aligned silicon nanowires of uniform diameters. We demonstrate that the diameter of the silicon nanowires can be precisely controlled to a precision of 10 nm in the range of 40 to 80 nm through fine-tuning of the pore diameter of the AAO template.

Rapid vacancy diffusion plays a significant role at low temperatures in forming heterostructures of nickel oxide (NiO) nanotubes with Ni nanowires. Subsequent investigations of Ni nanowire oxidation at higher temperatures and faster temperature ramp rates show that it is difficult to bypass this rapid vacancy diffusion stage. which affects the formation of the final structure. Therefore. it is unlikely to form solid NiO nanowires or NiO nanotubes with uniform wall thickness through the conventional annealing/oxidation process of Ni nanowires.

In this paper. we validate a simple model to relate the scan rate-dependent hysteresis of the solar cells and the defect assisted ion migration in perovskite materials by means of halide substitution to form MAPbBrxI3−x (x~0–0.6). prepared by a modified two-step method so as to put the systematic study at a high solar cell efficiency level. Concurrent with the substantially increased power conversion efficiency (PCE). significantly reduced hysteresis has also been observed with increasing Br concentration.

Here we report the first synthesis of mesoporous SnO2 single crystals (SnO2 MSCs) by a simple silica-templated hydrothermal method. and its application in solution-processed perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A relatively low efficiency (3.76%) was obtained due to the strong charge recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface. However. by coating a thin TiO2 barrier layer on SnO2via TiCl4 treatment. we were able to achieve an 8.54% power conversion efficiency (PCE).

The reduction in cost requires adsorbents with high capacities for CO2 sorption and high CO2-over-N2 selectivity. Amine-modified sorbents are promising candidates for carbon capture. To investigate the details of CO2 adsorption in such materials. we studied mesocaged (cubic. Pm3̅n symmetry) silica adsorbents with tethered propylamines using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and volumetric uptake experiments. The degree of heterogeneity in these coatings was varied by either cosynthesizing or postsynthetically introducing the propylamine modification. In situ FTIR spectroscopy revealed the presence of both physisorbed and chemisorbed CO2 in the materials.

For this reason. the selective reactivity of such a non-functional group is under active study since several decades and is still regarded as the Holy Grail in chemistry. Metal-catalyzed CH activation/functionalization chemistry allows the step-economical and original construction of CC as well as CO and CN bonds starting from hydrocarbons (or hydrocarbon fragments) without the need of prior non catalytic oxidation steps. Furthermore. it can be of utmost importance in the domain of multistep syntheses. and also in transformations of societal significance such as the conversion of methane into methanol.

Here. we studied the anti-inflammatory potential of choline in murine endotoxemia and sepsis. and the role of the α7nAChR in mediating the suppressive effect of choline on TNF release.

Although gas-phase unimolecular decomposition experiments suggest at least two major pathways. there is no mechanistic understanding of the reactions involving RDX or other energetic molecules (such as HMX and TATB). used in applications ranging from automobile air bags to rocket propellants. For the unimolecular decomposition of RDX. we find three pathways:  (i) concerted decomposition of the ring to form three CH2NNO2 (M = 74) molecules. and (ii) homolytic cleavage of an NN bond to form NO2 (M = 46) plus RDR (M = 176). which subsequently decomposes to form various products.

Since the weak noncovalent bonding interactions that contribute to the template-directed synthesis of such compounds live on between the components thereafter. they can be activated such that the components move in either a linear fashion (rotaxanes) or a rotary manner (catenanes). These molecules can be activated by switching the recognition elements off and on between components chemically. electrically. or optically. such that they perform motions reminiscent of the moving parts in macroscopic machines.

Amberlyst-15. The catalyst is modeled with the benzene sulfonic acid. and the effect of this acid on olefins such as isopropene (i-Pr) and tributene (t-Bu) in a phenol solution mimics the experimental condition. A neutral-pathway mechanism is established to account for early-stage high concentration of the phenolic ether observed in experiments. The mechanism involves an exothermic reaction between olefin and the benzene sulfonic acid to form ester followed by three reaction pathways leading to direct O-alkylation. o-C-alkylation. and p-C-alkylation.

1123395,Phase field modeling of solid electrolyte interface formation in lithium ion batteries,2013,Jie Deng and Gregory J Wagner and Richard P Muller,160,Journal of the Electrochemical Society,3,A487,IOP Publishing,A phase field model is presented to capture the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the anode surface in lithium ion batteries. In this model. the formation of an SEI layer is treated as a phase transformation process where the electrolyte phase is transformed to the SEI phase due to electrochemical reactions at the SEI/electrolyte interface during SEI growth. Numerical results show that SEI growth exhibits a power-law scaling with respect to time and is limited by the diffusion of electrons across the SEI layer. It is found that during SEI growth. the gradients of both electric potential and concentrations of species are built inside of the SEI layer. and the charge separation at the SEI/electrolyte interface remains with decreasing charge density at the interfacial region.

These two proteins are involved in copper trafficking in yeast cells. Calculations were performed starting with the copper ion either bound to Atx1 or to Ccc2 and using the experimental structures of the copper-loaded and apo forms of each protein. The copper binding motifs of the two proteins are found in close proximity. Copper tends to move from Atx1 to Ccc2. consistent with the physiological direction of transfer. with concomitant structural rearrangements. in agreement with experimental observations.

However. such proteins do exist and. furthermore. are specific for the Pt substrate considered. It follows that proteins are deeply involved in managing the biological activity of cisplatin. It is expected that. after the first 20 years in which most of the efforts were devoted to understanding its mode of interaction with DNA and consequent structural and functional alterations. the role of proteins will be more deeply scavenged. How cisplatin can survive the attack of the many platinophiles present in the extracellular and intracellular media is the issue addressed in this article.

However. the properties of these individual NWs remain unknown. Nevertheless. our calculations of their stability indicate that VS4 NWs can be separated from their bulk structures. Accordingly. we theoretically investigated the geometrical. electronic. and magnetic properties of bulk phase and isolated VS4 NWs. Our results indicate that both bulk phase and isolated VS4 NWs are semiconductors with band gaps of 2.24 and 2.64 eV. respectively. and that they prefer the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state based on DFT calculations. These calculations also suggested that isolated VS4 NWs show half-metallic antiferromagnetism upon electron and hole doping because carrier doping splits the spin degeneracy to induce …,True,epCA0qoAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,0,https://pubs.rsc.org/no/content/articlehtml/2021/tc/d1tc00096a,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12658,0,0,0

1123471,Relativistic quasiparticle self-consistent electronic structure of hybrid halide,2014,Federico Brivio and Keith T Butler and Aron Walsh and Mark van Schilfgaarde,7,Solar cells,,,,Solar cells based on a light absorbing layer of the hybrid halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 have recently reached 15% conversion efficiency. though how and why these materials work remains largely unknown. We analyse the electronic structure and optical properties within the quasiparticle self-consistent GW approximation. While this compound bears some similarity to conventional sp semiconductors. it also displays unique features. Quasiparticle self-consistency is essential for an accurate description of the band structure: bandgaps are much larger than what is predicted by the local density approximation (LDA) or GW based on the LDA. Valence band dispersions are modified in a very unusual manner. In addition. spin orbit coupling strongly modifies the band structure and gives rise to unconventional dispersion relations. The average hole mass is small. which accounts for the long diffusion lengths recently observed. The surface ionisation potential (workfunction) is calculated to be 5.7 eV with respect to the vacuum level. explaining efficient hole transfer to TiO2 and Au electrical contacts.One of the most promising third-generation photo-8 voltaic technologies is based on metal-organic halide 9 perovskites. 1–10 The materials physics of inorganic 10 (ABX3) perovskites is well developed; however. the re-11 placement of the inorganic cation by an isoelectronic or-12 ganic moiety provides an opportunity for tuning the lat-13 tice polarisation and optical response.

Frequently these same extracts also act on L-serine to form pyruvate and ammonia. Table I summarizes the available data on the serine and threonine dehydrasel activities in crude extracts from various sources. There is good evidence that a single enzyme is responsible for threonine and serine dehydrase activity in Neurospora crassa (4)) the rumen microorganism LC (5). and in Escherichia coli (2) although the situation in Escherichia coli is complicated by the existence of at least two threonine dehydrases (3). In the sheep it seems clear that there are two distinct enzymes; there is a serine dehydrase which does not attack L-threonine (7). and a threonine dehydrate which also has some serine dehydrase activity (8).There are three points of particular interest with regard to the activities in rat liver. The variation in reported activities is extraordinarily large. We shall show that this is probably due to variation in the assay procedure. Sayre. Jensen. and Greenberg (9) reported that the threonine. but not the serine dehydrase activity. was substrate-inducible both in vivo. and in the isolated. perfused liver. We shall present evidence to suggest that this enzyme is not substrate-inducible.

Consequently. the Ru(bpy)2(mcpbpy)2+ could not only cover the surface of PCN-777 but also graft into the interior of PCN-777. which greatly increased the loading amount of Ru(bpy)2(mcpbpy)2+ and effectively prevented the leaching of the Ru(bpy)2(mcpbpy)2+ resulting in a stable and high ECL response. Considering the above merits. we utilized the mesoporous Ru–PCN-777 to construct an ECL immunosensor to detect mucin 1 (MUC1) based on proximity-induced intramolecular DNA strand displacement (PiDSD).

The Asian-Pacific oscillation (APO) is defined as a zonal seesaw of the tropospheric temperature in the midlatitudes of the Asian-Pacific region. When the troposphere is cooling in the midlatitudes of the Asian continent. it is warming in the midlatitudes of the central and eastern North Pacific; and vice versa. The APO also appears in the stratosphere. but with a reversed phase. Used as an index of the thermal contrast between Asia and the North Pacific. it provides a new way to explore interactions between the Asian and Pacific atmospheric circulations. The APO index exhibits the interannual and interdecadal variability. It shows a downward trend during 1958–2001. indicating a weakening of the thermal contrast. and shows a 5.5-yr oscillation period. The formation of the APO is associated with the zonal vertical circulation caused by a difference in the solar radiative heating between the Asian continent and the North Pacific. The numerical simulations further reveal that the summer TP heating enhances the local tropospheric temperature and upward motion. and then strengthens downward motion and decreases the tropospheric temperature over the central and eastern North Pacific.

Inc.,Radiation crosslinking of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) with a degree of substitution (DS) from 0.7 to 2.2 was the subject of the current investigation. CMC was irradiated in solid‐state and aqueous solutions at various irradiation doses. The DS and the concentration of the aqueous solution had a remarkable affect on the crosslinking of CMC. Irradiation of CMC. even with a high DS. 2.2 in solid state. and a low DS. 0.7 in 10% aqueous solution. resulted in degradation. However. it was found that irradiation of CMC with a relatively high DS. 1.32. led to crosslinking in a 5% aqueous solution. and 20% CMC gave the highest gel fraction. CMC with a DS of 2.2 induced higher crosslinking than that with a DS of 1.32 at lower doses with the same concentration.

These bistable MIMs generally come in the form of [2]rotaxanes. molecular compounds that constitute a ring mechanically interlocked around a dumbbell-shaped component. or [2]catenanes. which are composed of two mechanically interlocked rings.

Thus. this method is well suited for analyzing a broad range of phospholipids without elaborate chromatographic separation. Evaluating the vast amounts of data resulting from these measurements is a rate-limiting step in the assessment of phospholipid composition. requiring the development and application of computational algorithms for mass spectrometry data.

Polymerization of -caprolactone,1994,Ivan Gitsov and Pavlina T Ivanova and Jean MJ Frechet,15,Macromolecular rapid communications,5,387-393,Basel; Heidelberg; Oxford. CT: Huthig & Wepf. c1994-,Recently we applied dendrimers formed by the convergent-growth approach’) to prepare the first examples of polymers with hybrid linear-globular architectures. By end-capping of preformed linear polymers: polystyrene 2. and poly (ethy1ene glyco1) s 3. with dendritic bromides we were able to synthesize unique hybrid block copolymers with interesting solution-and solid state properties. However. this synthetic strategy is not universally applicable for the connection of dendritic blocks to all types of linear blocks. An alternative approach would employ the dendrimers as initiators and “grow” the linear chain from its anchoring point on the globular macromolecule. A variation of this method was reported in a recent article4) where multifunctional dendritic initiators were used for the synthesis of star polymers. The results obtained were not very encouraging-the initiator efficiency was low and the star polymers formed had multimodal or broad molecular weight distribution (MWD). The problems encountered with such types of initiators bearing many active sites are usually caused by the incomplete activation of all reactive centers and by the poor control over the process of initiation.The goal of the present study is to explore the possibility to circumvent the above mentioned difficulties4) by using convergent dendrimers as macroinitiators. The advantage of these macromolecules is that they contain a single reactive group at their ‘focal’point that can be easily and completely activated; this ‘focal’point is easily accessible by both small5) and large molecules6).

While differences in liver lipids between disease states have been reported. precise composition of phospholipids and diacylglycerols (DAG) at a lipid species level has not been previously described. The goal of this study was to characterize changes in lipid species through progression of human NAFLD using advanced lipidomic technology and compare this with a murine model of early and advanced NAFLD.   Methods Utilizing mass spectrometry lipidomics. over 250 phospholipid and diacylglycerol species (DAGs) were identified in normal and diseased human and murine liver extracts.   Results Significant differences between phospholipid composition of normal and diseased livers were demonstrated. notably among DAG species. consistent with previous reports that DAG transferases are involved in the progression of NAFLD and liver fibrosis. In addition. a novel phospholipid species (ether linked phosphatidylinositol) was identified in human cirrhotic liver extracts.   Conclusions Using parallel lipidomics analysis of murine and human liver tissues it was determined that mice maintained on a high-fat diet provide a reproducible model of NAFLD in regards to specificity of lipid species in the liver.

1123659,Aspects of explosives detection,2011,Maurice Marshall and Jimmie C Oxley,,,,,Elsevier,Detection and quantification of trace chemicals is a major thrust of analytical chemistry. In recent years much effort has been spent developing detection systems for priority pollutants. Less mature are the detections of substances of interest to law enforcement and security personnel: in particular explosives. This volume will discuss the detection of these. not only setting out the theoretical fundamentals. but also emphasizing the remarkable developments in the last decade. Terrorist events—airplanes blown out of the sky (PanAm 103 over Lockerbie) and attacks on US and European cities (Trade Center in New York and the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. railways in London and Madrid)--emphasize the danger of concealed explosives. However. since most explosives release little vapor. it was not possible to detect them by technology used on most organic substances. After PanAm 103 was downed over Scotland. the US Congress requested automatic explosive detection equipment be placed in airports.

At temperatures over which thermal stability is normally examined. each of these classes of explosives has a common mode of decomposition available—loss of NO2. 3-13 Therefore. the trend in thermal stabilities is in line with the X—NO2 bond dissociation ener-gies: nitrate ester O—NO2. 40 kcal/mol; nitramine N—NO2. 47 kcal/mol; nitroarene C—NO2. 70 kcal/mol. 10,True,Xv3WEDkAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,52,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100023a043,7554055288297366881,/scholar?cites=7554055288297366881,,http://energetics.chm.uri.edu/system/files/J%20Phys%20Chem%20j100023a043.pdf,0,0,0

CO was the main product (about 3 mole/mole HMTD) and under air no trimethylamine was observed from the thermolysis. The observed changes in products may indicate a change in mechanism. but they can also be explained by a secondary reaction. the oxidation of trimethylamine to HCN and methanol.

The European Stationary Cycle test revealed no significant difference in engine operation for all tested blending ratios.[6] Considering the potential of HMF ethers as drop-in fuel replacements. the development of a continuous and scalable production process is highly desirable. To date. most HMF etherification reactions involve functionalizing the hydroxyl group of HMF to produce a monoether derivative.[5c. d. g–j] Although catalytic synthesis of the diether is more desirable.[7] it is more challenging because it requires hydrogenating the carbonyl group into an alcohol prior to etherification.

We report CE DNP experiments at 211. 600. and 800 MHz using a new series of biradical polarizing agents referred to as TEMTriPols. in which a nitroxide (TEMPO) and a trityl radical are chemically tethered. The TEMTriPol molecule with the optimal performance yields a record 1H NMR signal enhancement of 65 at 800 MHz at a concentration of 10 mM in a glycerol/water solvent matrix. The CE DNP enhancement for the TEMTriPol biradicals does not decrease as the magnetic field is increased in the manner usually observed for bis‐nitroxides.

The alkali modifiers were observed directly by MAS NMR to measure the change in chemical shift with composition. All alkali peaks shift to higher frequency with increasing loading. indicative of decreasing average coordination numbers.

PALS also shows evidence of both smaller ultramicropores and larger supermicropores in these materials. The method of adsorption porosimetry and the alpha-plot analysis provide an understanding of the PALS connectivity results through a correlation of high pore connectivity with a high fraction of porosity as the larger supermicropores.

In the early 2000s and in anticipation to future low-k related integration challenges. the semiconductor industry started to investigate the possibility to repair or prevent this damage. It is remarkable that the most disruptive solutions proposed today are inspired from the work initiated more than 10 years ago.

Proteins bind to nanoparticles to form a protein corona. We modulate this corona by using surface-engineered nanoparticles. and identify protein composition to provide insight into disease development.   Methods/Principal Findings Using a family of structurally homologous nanoparticles we have investigated the changes in the protein corona around surface-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) from normal and malignant ovarian cell lysates. Proteomics analysis using mass spectrometry identified hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) that is found exclusively on positively charged AuNPs (+AuNPs) after incubation with the lysates. We confirmed expression of HDGF in various ovarian cancer cells and validated binding selectivity to +AuNPs by Western blot analysis. Silencing of HDGF by siRNA resulted s inhibition in proliferation of ovarian cancer cells.   Conclusion We investigated the modulation of protein corona around surface-functionalized gold nanoparticles as a promising approach to identify new therapeutic targets. The potential of our method for identifying therapeutic targets was demonstrated through silencing of HDGF by siRNA. which inhibited proliferation of ovarian cancer cells.

We investigated the spectral shift systematically by using seven types of porphyrin derivatives. differing in their center metal. meso substituent. and number of cationic sites. The aggregation. which usually induces the spectral shift. is suppressed in our clay/porphyrin systems. The adsorption strengths of porphyrin molecules on the clay surface were estimated as the relative adsorption equilibrium constants Krel. The seven types of porphyrins studied had different values of Krel. which can be explained by the steric effect and the Coulomb interaction due to the differences in the molecular structure.

Therefore. one may think of dendrimers as multisite guests for chemical interactions/reactions of any nature. an idea that conveys their potential use for chemical amplification. In this paper. we describe the first use of dendritic terminal groups for inclusion complexation by well-known molecular hosts. 8 specifically the cyclodextrins (CDs). Our data indicate that dendrimers of moderate size act as effective guests leading to the formation of very large supramolecular complexes.

The whey-coating application was performed at semi-industrial scale. High barrier to oxygen with transmission rate down to ranges of 1 cm3 (STP) m−2 d−1 bar−1 at                            and 50% relative humidity (r.h.) but interesting humidity barrier down to ranges of 3 g m−2 d−1 (both normalized to 100 μm thickness) were reached. outperforming most existing biopolymers. Coated films were validated for storing various food products showing that the shelf life and sensory attributes were maintained similar to reference packaging films while complying with food safety regulations. The developed whey coating could be enzymatically removed within 2 hours and is therefore compatible with plastic recycling operations to allow multilayer films to become recyclable by separating the other combined layers.

It is well known that nanomaterial behavior is governed by the size and composition of the particles. though the effects of small differences in size toward biological cells have not been well investigated. Palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) have gained significant interest as catalysts for important carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom reactions and are increasingly used in the chemical industry. however. few other applications of Pd NPs have been investigated.

Band gap excitation of these materials in methanol or aqueous (pH 4 or 8) solutions leads to the reduction of hemin to heme (FeIII → FeII) and the production of TiO2(e-). heme/TiO2(e-). The mechanisms and second-order rate constants for the reduction of bromobenzene. chlorobenzene. dichlorobenzene. and trichloroethylene were quantified. In all cases. the concentration of TiO2(e-) was found to decrease to near zero before the hemes were oxidized to hemin. Comparative studies with TiO2(e-) that were not functionalized with hemes indicate that organohalide reduction is mediated by the hemes. Reactions of 6-bromo-1-hexene with heme/TiO2(e-) demonstrate multi-electron transfer reactivity and show that heme/TiO2(e-) nanocrystallites deliver two electrons to RX within 4.5 μs. ,True,9-qjXYoAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,54,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja055908+,6013993651457579418,/scholar?cites=6013993651457579418,,,0,0,0

The increased manufacture and use of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in consumer products as well as industrial processes is expected to lead to the unintentional release of IONPs into the environment. The impact of IONPs on the environment and on biological species is not well understood but remains a concern due to the increased chemical reactivity of nanoparticles relative to their bulk counterparts. This review article describes the impact of IONPs on cellular genetic components. The mutagenic impact of IONPs may damage an organism’s ability to develop or reproduce. To date. there has been experimental evidence of IONPs having mutagenic interactions on human cell lines including lymphoblastoids. fibroblasts. microvascular endothelial cells. bone marrow cells. lung epithelial cells. alveolar type II like epithelial cells. bronchial fibroblasts. skin epithelial cells. hepatocytes. cerebral endothelial cells. fibrosarcoma cells. breast carcinoma cells. lung carcinoma cells. and cervix carcinoma cells.

The resulting polyethylenes possess high molecular weights (Mw up to 106 g mol−1) and feature high degrees of branching. The MM-QEq method was employed to assess the ligands' effects on catalytic activities.

Inc.,The question whether the nucleobases can be synthesized in interstellar space is of fundamental significance in considerations of the origin of life. Adenine is formally the HCN pentamer. and experiments have demonstrated that adenine is formed under certain conditions by HCN pentamerization in gas. liquid. and condensed phases. Most mechanistic proposals invoke the intermediacy of the HCN tetramer AICN (4). and it is thought that adenine synthesis is completed by addition of the 5th HCN to 4 to form amidine 5 and subsequent pyrimidine cyclization. In this context. we have been studying the mechanism for prebiotic pyrimidine-ring formation of monocyclic HCN-pentamers with ab initio electronic structure theory. The calculations model gas phase chemistry. and the results primarily inform discussions of adenine synthesis in interstellar space.

The first generation of biopharmaceutical products manufactured using recombinant technologies was launched in the 1980s. and they are now on the way to patent expiration. As a result. research-based and generic pharmaceutical companies alike are pursuing the opportunity to develop “generic” substitutes for original biologics. herein referred to as biosimilars. However. the process of introducing a biosimilar to an innovator product is far more complex than the relatively straightforward process of introducing a generic equivalent to an innovator product based on a new chemical entity. Biologics are produced by cells in culture or whole organisms. which are inherently more variable than chemical synthesis methods. Therefore. unlike generic pharmaceuticals. it is impossible to generate the same or identical copy of an innovator product. In this way. biosimilars are “similar but not the same” or in other words biosimilars are “the twin but not the clone” to the original biologic innovator product. Therefore the field of biosimilars presents several important challenges. including i) verification of the similarity. ii) the interchangeability of biosimilars and innovator products. iii) the possible need for unique naming to differentiate the various biopharmaceutical products. iv) regulatory framework. v) commercial opportunities as well as guidelines to assist manufacturers in product development. vi) intellectual property rights. and vii) public safety.,True,PiZXVIAAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C,113,https://www.dovepress.com/biosimilars-an-overview-peer-reviewed-article-BS,15383245051300407745,/scholar?cites=15383245051300407745,,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=9251,0,0,0

In agriculture. the preferred chiral form of a pesticide is more effective at lower application rates or more specific toward a targeted pest. Other advantages of chiral pure pesticides include greater environmental safety. reduced cost. greater specificity and extended patent life. Recent progress in optical resolution. asymmetric synthesis and biocatalysis of chiral pesticides has been described. Techniques to separate enantiomers with chiral HPLC and GC columns. electrophoresis and mass spectrometry have been reported. Chiral chase is actively pursuing asymmetric hydrogenation for the manufacture of a pure single-enantiomer pesticide. Enantioselectivity occurs in pesticidal activities toward target organisms as well as non-targeted organisms. There is a need to characterize both enantiomers of chiral pesticides in order to have an accurate understanding of their distribution and fate in the environment. Enantiomeric analysis can be useful in this aim and this is an important consideration in the risk assessment of pesticides. Use of only the target-active enantiomer of pesticides should be encouraged as it will reduce the pollutant load. provided it has no adverse impact on non-target organisms.© Pesticide Science Society of Japan,True,PiZXVIAAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,113,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jpestics/34/1/34_R08-03/_article/-char/ja/,1933915241642119045,/scholar?cites=1933915241642119045,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jpestics/34/1/34_R08-03/_pdf,0,0,0

1124117,Exploiting the power of stereochemistry in drugs: an overview of racemic and enantiopure drugs,2013,Bhupinder Singh Sekhon,1,J. Mod. Med. Chem,1,10-36,,Stereochemistry is one of the essential dimensions in pharmacology as it dictates how enantiomers interact with biological systems. Chirality is very important in drug design. Enantiomers of the same chiral drug can have different pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic properties. In this context. replacing some existing racemates with single isomers has resulted in improved safety and/or efficacy profile of various racemates. Single enantiomer drug use can potentially lead to simpler and more selective pharmacologic profiles. improved therapeutic indices. simpler pharmacokinetics due to different rates of metabolism of the different enantiomers. decreased drug interactions. and drug companies are increasingly using chiral switching as a marketing strategy. Additionally. due to different pharmacological activity. enantiomers of chiral drugs can differ in toxicity. However. unpredicted toxicity has been reported in some chiral switching cases which has resulted the withdrawal of the enantiomer from the market or a halt in its development. In view of above. before switching to single enantiomer drugs. prescribers should look for evidence from well-conducted clinical trials to prove that the chiral switch is cost-effective and improves the outcomes for patients rather than patents. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have allowed single enantiomers of generic drugs to be patented and marketed under different name. FDA regulations require that all chiral bioactive drug molecules must be isolated and tested for the efficacy and safety. and have to be as pure as possible containing a single pure enantiomer.,True,PiZXVIAAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,57,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.402.9253&rep=rep1&type=pdf,11053694975760647519,/scholar?cites=11053694975760647519,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.402.9253&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Porous alumina membrane (PAM) was used as the host. and poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) were guest materials. The energy transfer between PVK and Alq3 within a PAM shows greatly enhanced efficiency compared with that of the bulk film. Such high efficiency is ascribed to a lowered formation of the fully overlapped form of the PVK excimer. which is induced by strong interaction between the pendant carbazole rings of PVK and the Al centers on the innerchannel surface of the PAM. The photoluminescence lifetimes of PVK become shorter with an increase in the Alq3 concentration in both films and PAMs. due to the energy transfer.

G2 = 6% NaF + 6% CaF2) on the remineralization of white spot lesions (WSL). The sample was composed of 15 (7- to 12-year-old) children with 45 active WSL in anterior permanent teeth. The children were randomly divided into two groups providing 22 lesions for G1 and 23 for G2. The children were submitted to weekly varnish applications 4 times. The WSL were evaluated twice: baseline and on week 4. Maximum lesion dimensions (mesiodistal and incisogingival) were measured in millimeters and classified in four grades of size. WSL were also assessed regarding lesion activity by one calibrated examiner. The Pearson chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used (P < 0.01). WSL reductions were observed in both varnish groups (Chi-square = 0.15. d.f. = 1. P = 0.90). and with similar magnitude (in mm): 1.19 and 1.29 for G1 and G2. respectively. Thirty-six WSL (15 in G1 and 21 in G2) were classified as inactive on week 4. reaching an overall value of 80%. No difference was observed between G1 and G2 regarding activity scores (Fisher's exact test. p > 0.01).
