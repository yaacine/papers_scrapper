For example. bacterial hyperthermophiles seem to have exchanged genes with archaea to a greater extent than other bacteria. whereas transfer of certain classes of eukaryotic genes is most common in parasitic and symbiotic bacteria. Horizontal transfer events can be classified into distinct categories of acquisition of new genes. acquisition of paralogs of existing genes. and xenologous gene displacement whereby a gene is displaced by a horizontally transferred ortholog from another lineage (xenolog).

This apparent lack of specific TFs is paradoxical. given that the apicomplexans show a complex developmental cycle in one or more hosts and a reproducible pattern of differential gene expression in course of this cycle. Using sensitive sequence profile searches. we show that the apicomplexans possess a lineage-specific expansion of a novel family of proteins with a version of the AP2 (Apetala2)-integrase DNA binding domain. which is present in numerous plant TFs.

Structural integrity of the nucleus is maintained by the nuclear envelope (NE). A crucial element of this structure is the nuclear pore complex (NPC). a macromolecular machine with over 90 protein components. which mediates nucleo-cytoplasmic communication. Given the indispensability of these structures for nuclear function. the natural history of the nucleus can only be understood in terms of the origin and subsequent evolution of NE and NPC components.

Using sequence and structure analysis we identify multiple novel homologs of the DENN module. many of which can be traced back to the ancestral eukaryote. These findings provide unexpected leads regarding key cellular processes such as autophagy. vesicle-vacuole interactions. chromosome segregation and human disease. Of these. SMCR8. the folliculin interacting protein-1 and 2 (FNIP1 and FNIP2). nitrogen permease regulator 2 (NPR2) and NPR3 are proposed to function in recruiting Rab GTPases during different steps of autophagy. fusion of autophagosomes with the vacuole and regulation of cellular metabolism. Another novel DENN protein identified in this study is C9ORF72; expansions of the hexanucleotide GGGGCC in its first intron have been recently implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). While this mutation is proposed to cause a RNA-level defect. the identification of C9ORF72 as a potential DENN-type GEF raises the possibility that at least part of the pathology might relate to a specific Rab-dependent vesicular trafficking process. as has been observed in the case of some other neurological conditions with similar phenotypes.

They sense NO by means of a heme moiety that is bound to their N-terminal extensions. Using sequence profile searches we show that the N-terminal extensions of the SGCs contain two globular domains. The first of these. the HNOB (H eme NO Binding) domain. is a predominantly α-helical domain and binds heme via a covalent linkage to histidine. Versions lacking this conserved histidine and are likely to interact with heme non-covalently. We detected HNOB domains in several bacterial lineages. where they occur fused to methyl accepting domains of chemotaxis receptors or as standalone proteins. The standalone forms are encoded by predicted operons that also contain genes for two component signaling systems and GGDEF-type nucleotide cyclases. The second domain. the HNOB associated (HNOBA) domain occurs between the HNOB and the cyclase domains in the animal SGCs. The HNOBA domain is also detected in bacteria and is always encoded by a gene. which occurs in the neighborhood of a gene for a HNOB domain. The HNOB domain is predicted to function as a heme-dependent sensor for gaseous ligands. and transduce diverse downstream signals. in both bacteria and animals. The HNOBA domain functionally interacts with the HNOB domain. and possibly binds a ligand. either in cooperation. or independently of the latter domain. Phyletic profiles and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the HNOB and HNOBA domains were acquired by the animal lineage via lateral transfer from a bacterial source.,True,aS_TLX4AAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,214,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-4-5,13675513877409769963,/scholar?cites=13675513877409769963,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-4-5,0,0,0

Genes in such networks are subject to expression noise. resulting in isogenic cell populations exhibiting cell-to-cell variation in protein levels. Increasing evidence suggests that cells have evolved regulatory strategies to limit. tolerate or amplify expression noise.

10101013,Evolutionary connection between the catalytic subunits of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases and eukaryotic RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and the origin of RNA polymerases,2003,Lakshminarayan M Iyer and Eugene V Koonin and L Aravind,3,BMC structural biology,1,1-23,BioMed Central,The eukaryotic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) is involved in the amplification of regulatory microRNAs during post-transcriptional gene silencing. This enzyme is highly conserved in most eukaryotes but is missing in archaea and bacteria. No evolutionary relationship between RDRP and other polymerases has been reported so far. hence the origin of this eukaryote-specific polymerase remains a mystery. Using extensive sequence profile searches. we identified bacteriophage homologs of the eukaryotic RDRP. The comparison of the eukaryotic RDRP and their homologs from bacteriophages led to the delineation of the conserved portion of these enzymes. which is predicted to harbor the catalytic site. Further. detailed sequence comparison. aided by examination of the crystal structure of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DDRP). showed that the RDRP and the β' subunit of DDRP (and its orthologs in archaea and eukaryotes) contain a conserved double-psi β-barrel (DPBB) domain. This DPBB domain contains the signature motif DbDGD (b is a bulky residue). which is conserved in all RDRPs and DDRPs and contributes to catalysis via a coordinated divalent cation. Apart from the DPBB domain. no similarity was detected between RDRP and DDRP. which leaves open two scenarios for the origin of RDRP: i) RDRP evolved at the onset of the evolution of eukaryotes via a duplication of the DDRP β' subunit followed by dramatic divergence that obliterated the sequence similarity outside the core catalytic domain and ii) the primordial RDRP. which consisted primarily of the DPBB domain. evolved from a common ancestor with the …,True,aS_TLX4AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,212,https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-3-1,16450704084641118487,/scholar?cites=16450704084641118487,,https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-3-1,0,0,0

State of the Art lecture.,1989,Paul M Vanhoutte,13,,6_pt_2,658-667,,The response of isolated blood vessels to a variety of vasoactive agonists is modulated by the presence of endothelial cells. Indeed. these cells can release both dilator and constrictor substances. The major endothelium-derived relaxing factor may be nitric oxide. which activates soluble guanylate cyclase in the smooth muscle. although the endothelial cells also secrete an unidentified hyperpolarizing factor. Among the natural stimuli for the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors are circulating hormones. platelet products. thrombin. shear stress. and certain autacoids.

AMP. and adenosine;(b) observation of the selective actions of antagonists. in particular the methylxanthines;(c) modulation of adenylyl cyclase by adenosine but not ATP; and (d) induction of prostaglandin synthesis by ATP but not adenosine.

Role of the increase in cytosolic calcium concentration in the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRF). Endothelial receptor activation induces an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm of the endothelial cell; following interaction with calmodulin. this activates NO-synthase and cyclooxygenase. and leads to the release of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). NO causes relaxation by activating the formation of cyclic GMP (cGMP) from GTP. EDHF causes hyperpolarization and relaxation by opening K+ channels. Prostacyclin (PGI2) causes relaxation by activating adenylate cyclase (AC) which leads to the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Any increase in cytosolic calcium (including that induced by the calcium ionophore A23187) causes the release of relaxing factors. When agonists activate the endothelial cells. an increase in inositol phosphate (IP3) may contribute to the increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ by releasing it from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)(From Vanhoutte PM.

We present experimental evidence that perturbation of an antisense RNA can alter the expression of sense messenger RNAs. suggesting that antisense transcription contributes to control of transcriptional outputs in mammals.,True,33sEewQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1765,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/309/5740/1564.abstract,1486125071416290624,/scholar?cites=1486125071416290624,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44407072/1564.full.pdf,0,0,0

Retrotransposons located immediately 5′ of protein-coding loci frequently function as alternative promoters and/or express noncoding RNAs. More than a quarter of RefSeqs possess a retrotransposon in their 3′ UTR. with strong evidence for the reduced expression of these transcripts relative to retrotransposon-free transcripts.

Analysis of the networks reveals that highly connected TFs are broadly expressed across tissues. and that roughly half of the measured interactions are conserved between mouse and human. The data highlight the importance of TF combinations for determining cell fate. and they lead to the identification of a SMAD3/FLI1 complex expressed during development of immunity.

Our international collaboration has validated 21.037 human gene candidates by analysis of high-quality full-length cDNA clones through curation using unified criteria. This led to the identification of 5.155 new gene candidates. It also manifested the most reliable way to control the quality of the cDNA clones. We have developed a human gene database. called the H-Invitational Database (H-InvDB; http://www.h-invitational.jp/). It provides the following: integrative annotation of human genes. description of gene structures. details of novel alternative splicing isoforms. non-protein-coding RNAs. functional domains. subcellular localizations. metabolic pathways. predictions of protein three-dimensional structure. mapping of known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). identification of polymorphic microsatellite repeats within human genes. and comparative results with mouse full-length cDNAs.

These findings have paved the way for analogous investigations on other lncRNAs and chromatin remodelling enzymes. Here we discuss these common mechanisms and provide our view on other molecules that warrant similar investigations. We also present our concepts on the possible mechanisms that may facilitate the exit of genes from the silencing domains and their potential therapeutic applications.

Although much recent attention has focused on tiny 22- to 25-nucleotide microRNAs. several functional ncRNAs are orders of magnitude larger in size. Examples of such macro ncRNAs include Xist and Air. which in mouse are 18 and 108 kilobases (Kb). respectively. We surveyed the 102.801 FANTOM3 mouse cDNA clones and found that Air and Xist were present not as single. full-length transcripts but as a cluster of multiple. shorter cDNAs. which were unspliced. had little coding potential. and were most likely primed from internal adenine-rich regions within longer parental transcripts. We therefore conducted a genome-wide search for regional clusters of such cDNAs to find novel macro ncRNA candidates. Sixty-six regions were identified. each of which mapped outside known protein-coding loci and which had a mean length of 92 Kb. We detected several known long ncRNAs within these regions. supporting the basic rationale of our approach. In silico analysis showed that many regions had evidence of imprinting and/or antisense transcription. These regions were significantly associated with microRNAs and transcripts from the central nervous system. We selected eight novel regions for experimental validation by northern blot and RT-PCR and found that the majority represent previously unrecognized noncoding transcripts that are at least 10 Kb in size and predominantly localized in the nucleus.

The mouse strains examined varied greatly in the number. amplitude and rate of induction of genes expressed in response to LPS. The response was attenuated in the C3H/HeJlps                     d                   strain. which has a mutation in the LPS receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).

There was no clear correlation between gene induction patterns and variation at the Bcg locus (Slc11A1) or propensity to bias Th1 versus Th2 T cell activation responses. Macrophages from each strain responded to LPS with unique gene expression profiles.

Consequently. mRNA remains protected from chemical and enzymatic degradation during the overnight biotinylation step. thus making it possible to select full-length cDNAs of longer …,True,33sEewQAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,137,https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article-abstract/4/1/61/372241,15165840093340254856,/scholar?cites=15165840093340254856,,https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article-pdf/4/1/61/6719410/dnares_4_1_61.pdf,0,0,0
10101208,Discovery and functional analysis of lncRNAs: methodologies to investigate an uncharacterized transcriptome,2016,Kaori Kashi and Lindsey Henderson and Alessandro Bonetti and Piero Carninci,1859,,1,3-15,Elsevier,It is known that more than 70% of mammalian genomes are transcribed. yet the vast majority of transcripts do not code for proteins. Are these noncoding transcripts merely transcriptional noise. or do they serve a biological purpose? Recent developments in genomic analysis technologies. especially sequencing methods. have allowed researchers to create a large atlas of transcriptomes. study subcellular localization. and investigate potential interactions with proteins for a growing number of transcripts. Here. we review the current methodologies available for discovering and investigating functions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). which require a wide variety of applications to study their potential biological roles.

Modern high-throughput technologies enable deep sequencing of such RNA species on an unprecedented scale. We find that the analysis of small RNA deep-sequencing libraries can be affected by cross-mapping. in which RNA sequences originating from one locus are inadvertently mapped to another. Similar to cross-hybridization on microarrays. cross-mapping is prevalent among miRNAs. as they tend to occur in families. are similar or derived from repeat or structural RNAs. or are post-transcriptionally modified. Here. we develop a strategy to correct for cross-mapping. and apply it to the analysis of RNA editing in mature miRNAs.

10101215,Transcriptional and structural impact of TATA-initiation site spacing in mammalian core promoters,2006,Jasmina Ponjavic and Boris Lenhard and Chikatoshi Kai and Jun Kawai and Piero Carninci and Yoshihide Hayashizaki and Albin Sandelin,7,Genome biology,8,1-18,BioMed Central,The TATA box. one of the most well studied core promoter elements. is associated with induced. context-specific expression. The lack of precise transcription start site (TSS) locations linked with expression information has impeded genome-wide characterization of the interaction between TATA and the pre-initiation complex. Using a comprehensive set of 5.66 × 106 sequenced 5' cDNA ends from diverse tissues mapped to the mouse genome. we found that the TATA-TSS distance is correlated with the tissue specificity of the downstream transcript. To achieve tissue-specific regulation. the TATA box position relative to the TSS is constrained to a narrow window (-32 to -29). where positions -31 and -30 are the optimal positions for achieving high tissue specificity. Slightly larger spacings can be accommodated only when there is no optimally spaced initiation signal; in contrast. the TATA box like motifs found downstream of position -28 are generally nonfunctional. The strength of the TATA binding protein-DNA interaction plays a subordinate role to spacing in terms of tissue specificity. Furthermore. promoters with different TATA-TSS spacings have distinct features in terms of consensus sequence around the initiation site and distribution of alternative TSSs. Unexpectedly. promoters that have two dominant. consecutive TSSs are TATA depleted and have a novel GGG initiation site consensus. In this report we present the most comprehensive characterization of TATA-TSS spacing and functionality to date.

We classified TSSs into four types based on compositional properties of regions immediately surrounding them. These properties highlighted distinctive features in the extended core promoters that helped us delineate boundaries of the transcription initiation domain space for both species. The TSS types were analyzed for associations with initiating dinucleotides. CpG islands. TATA boxes. and an extensive collection of statistically significant cis-elements in mouse and human. We found that different TSS types show preferences for different sets of initiating dinucleotides and cis-elements. Through Gene Ontology and eVOC categories and tissue expression libraries we linked TSS characteristics to expression. Moreover. we show a link of TSS characteristics to very specific genomic organization in an example of immune-response-related genes (GO:0006955).

(X = halogen. R = aryl) as hydroformylation catalysts for alkenes is studied. It is shown that an inhibition period is removed by addition of hydrogen halide acceptors and that the halide complex undergoes hydrogenolysis to form a hydrido-species. The hydrido-species is only one of several complexes in equilibrium but it appears that the principal active catalytic species is RhH(CO)2(PPh3)2. This species is formed by addition of carbon monoxide to the monocarbonyl complex RhH(CO)(PPh3)2. The latter is also formed by dissociation when the stable crystalline complex RhH(CO)(PPh3)3 is dissolved in benzene or other solvents. With RhH(CO)(PPh3)3 as catalyst. alkenes undergo rapid hydroformylation even at 25°/1 atm.; with alk-1-enes the ratio of straight- to branched-chain aldehyde formed is considerably higher than the ratios normally found …,True,J666WVMAAAAJ:JH5k92_tO-AC,535,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1968/j1/j19680003133,8455787257878339078,/scholar?cites=8455787257878339078,,,0,0,0

Doyle. and Keith Glover. entitled Robust and Optimal Control. which has been extensively class-tested in many universities around the world. Unlike that book. which is intended primarily as a comprehensive reference of robust and H∞ control theory. this book is intended to be a text for a graduate course in multivariable control. It is also intended to be a reference for practicing control engineers who are interested in applying the state-of-the-art robust control techniques in their applications. With this objective in mind. I have streamlined the presentation. added more than 50 illustrative examples. included many related Matlab R commands1 and more than 150 exercise problems. and added some recent developments in the area of robust control such as gap metric. ν-gap metric. model validation. and mixed µ problem. In addition. many proofs are completely rewritten and some advanced topics are either deleted completely or do not get an in-depth treatment. The prerequisite for reading this book is some basic knowledge of classical control theory and state-space theory.

Our focus is on systems which are optimized. either through natural selection or engineering design. to provide robust performance despite uncertain environments. We suggest that power laws in these systems are due to tradeoffs between yield. cost of resources. and tolerance to risks. These tradeoffs lead to highly optimized designs that allow for occasional large events. We investigate the mechanism in the context of percolation and sand pile models in order to emphasize the sharp contrasts between HOT and self-organized criticality (SOC). which has been widely suggested as the origin for power laws in complex systems.

10101345,Cross-layer congestion control. routing and scheduling design in ad hoc wireless networks,2006,Lijun Chen and Steven H Low and Mung Chiang and John C Doyle,,,,676-688,IEEE,This paper considers jointly optimal design of crosslayer congestion control. routing and scheduling for ad hoc wireless networks. We first formulate the rate constraint and scheduling constraint using multicommodity flow variables. and formulate resource allocation in networks with fixed wireless channels (or single-rate wireless devices that can mask channel variations) as a utility maximization problem with these constraints. By dual decomposition. the resource allocation problem naturally decomposes into three subproblems: congestion control. routing and scheduling that interact through congestion price. The global convergence property of this algorithm is proved. We next extend the dual algorithm to handle networks with timevarying channels and adaptive multi-rate devices. The stability of the resulting system is established. and its performance is characterized with respect to an ideal reference system which has the best feasible rate region at link layer. We then generalize the aforementioned results to a general model of queueing network served by a set of interdependent parallel servers with time-varying service capabilities. which models many design problems in communication networks. We show that for a general convex optimization problem where a subset of variables lie in a polytope and the rest in a convex set. the dual-based algorithm remains stable and optimal when the constraint set is modulated by an irreducible finite-state Markov chain.

For modeling approaches that focus on robustness and fragility as unifying concepts. the Internet is an especially attractive case study. mainly because its applications are ubiquitous and pervasive. and widely available expositions exist at every level of detail. Nevertheless. alternative approaches to modeling the Internet often make extremely different assumptions and derive opposite conclusions about fundamental properties of one and the same system. Fortunately. a detailed understanding of Internet technology combined with a unique ability to measure the network means that these differences can be understood thoroughly and resolved unambiguously.

We develop a general multi-link multi-source model for TCP/RED and derive a local stability condition in the case of a single link with heterogeneous sources.

We develop a general multi-link multi-source model for TCP/RED and derive a local stability condition in the case of a single link with heterogeneous sources. We validate our model with simulations and illustrate the stability region of TCP/RED. These results suggest that TCP/RED becomes unstable when delay increases. or more strikingly. when link capacity increases. The analysis illustrates the difficulty of setting RED parameters to stabilize TCP: they can be tuned to improve stability. but only at the cost of large queues even when they are dynamically adjusted.

For a simple two-state model of glycolysis. we explicitly derive analytic equations for hard trade-offs between robustness and efficiency with oscillations as an inevitable side effect. The model describes how the trade-offs arise from individual parameters. including the interplay of feedback control with autocatalysis of network products necessary to power and catalyze intermediate reactions. We then use control theory to prove that the essential features of these hard trade-off “laws” are universal and fundamental. in that they depend minimally on the details of this system and generalize to the robust efficiency of any autocatalytic network.

We show that an equilibrium of TCP/IP. if exists. maximizes aggregate utility over both source rates and routes. provided congestion prices are used as link costs. An equilibrium exists if and only if this utility maximization problem and its Lagrangian dual have no duality gap. In this case. TCP/IP incurs no penalty in not splitting traffic across multiple paths. Such an equilibrium. however. can be unstable. It can be stabilized by adding a static component to link cost. but at the expense of a reduced utility in equilibrium. If link capacities are optimally provisioned. however. pure static routing. which is necessarily stable. is sufficient to maximize utility.

In contrast with prior work. we extend Bode's integral equation for the case where the preview is made available to the controller via a general. finite capacity. communication system. Under asymptotic stationarity assumptions. our results show that the new fundamental limitation differs from Bode's only by a constant. which quantifies the information rate through the communication system. In the absence of asymptotic stationarity. we derive a universal lower bound which uses Shannon's entropy rate as a measure of performance.

Using module-based analysis coupled with rigorous mathematical comparisons. we propose that in analogy to control engineering architectures. the complexity of cellular systems and the presence of hierarchical modular structures can be attributed to the necessity of achieving robustness. We employ the Escherichia coli heat shock response system. a strongly conserved cellular mechanism. as an example to explore the design principles of such modular architectures. In the heat shock response system. the sigma-factor σ32 is a central regulator that integrates multiple feedforward and feedback modules. Each of these modules provides a different type of robustness with its inherent tradeoffs in terms of transient response and efficiency. We demonstrate how the overall architecture of the system balances such tradeoffs. An extensive mathematical exploration nevertheless points to the existence of an array of alternative strategies for the existing heat shock response that could exhibit similar behavior. We therefore deduce that the evolutionary constraints facing the system might have steered its architecture toward one of many robustly functional solutions.,True,C6DtGmMAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,128,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020059,8273470292306690099,/scholar?cites=8273470292306690099,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020059,0,0,0

The hypothesis on which detection is based is that the apparent rotor resistance of an induction motor will increase when a rotor bar breaks. To detect broken bars. measurements of stator voltages and currents are processed by an extended Kalman filter for the speed and rotor resistance simultaneous estimation. In particular. rotor resistance is estimated and compared with its nominal value to detect broken bars. In the proposed extended Kalman filter approach. the state covariance matrix is adequacy weighted leading to a better states estimation dynamic. Its main advantage is the correct rotor resistance estimation even for an unloaded induction motor. As part of this estimation process. it is necessary to compensate for the thermal variation in the rotor resistance.

Fibroblasts from different anatomic sites have distinct and characteristic gene expression patterns. but the principles that govern their molecular specialization are poorly understood. Spatial organization of cellular differentiation may be achieved by unique specification of each cell type; alternatively. organization may arise by cells interpreting their position along a coordinate system. Here we test these models by analyzing the genome-wide gene expression profiles of primary fibroblast populations from 43 unique anatomical sites spanning the human body. Large-scale differences in the gene expression programs were related to three anatomic divisions: anterior-posterior (rostral-caudal). proximal-distal. and dermal versus nondermal. A set of 337 genes that varied according to these positional divisions was able to group all 47 samples by their anatomic sites of origin. Genes involved in pattern formation. cell-cell signaling. and matrix remodeling were enriched among this minimal set of positional identifier genes. Many important features of the embryonic pattern of HOX gene expression were retained in fibroblasts and were confirmed both in vitro and in vivo.

Here we discover and characterize the sets of mouse lncRNAs induced by inflammatory signaling via TNFα. TNFα regulates hundreds of lncRNAs. including 54 pseudogene lncRNAs. several of which show exquisitely selective expression in response to specific cytokines and microbial components in a NF-κB-dependent manner. Lethe. a pseudogene lncRNA. is selectively induced by proinflammatory cytokines via NF-κB or glucocorticoid receptor agonist. and functions in negative feedback signaling to NF-κB. Lethe interacts with NF-κB subunit RelA to inhibit RelA DNA binding and target gene activation. Lethe level decreases with organismal age. a physiological state associated with increased NF-κB activity.

We found that in each of the cell types the two modifications were differentially enriched at the promoters of the two largest classes of transcription factors. Specifically. zinc finger (ZNF) genes were bound by H3me3K9 and homeobox genes were bound by H3me3K27. We have previously shown that the Polycomb repressive complex 2 is responsible for mediating trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 in human cancer cells. In contrast. there is little overlap between H3me3K9 targets and components of the Polycomb repressive complex 2. suggesting that a different histone methyltransferase is responsible for the H3me3K9 modification. Previous studies have shown that SETDB1 can trimethylate H3 on lysine 9. using in vitro or artificial tethering assays. SETDB1 is thought to be recruited to chromatin by complexes containing the KAP1 corepressor. To determine if a KAP1-containing complex mediates trimethylation of the identified H3me3K9 targets. we performed ChIP-chip assays and identified KAP1 target genes using human 5-kb promoter arrays. We found that a large number of genes of ZNF transcription factors were bound by both KAP1 and H3me3K9 in normal and cancer cells. To expand our studies of KAP1. we next performed a complete genomic analysis of KAP1 binding using a 38-array tiling set. identifying ~7.000 KAP1 …,True,7de84zoAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,217,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030089,9374534927011448983,/scholar?cites=9374534927011448983,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030089,0,0,0

The H3K27me3 demethylase UTX functions in development and tumor suppression with undefined mechanisms. Here. genome-wide chromatin occupancy analysis of UTX and associated histone modifications reveals distinct classes of UTX target genes. including genes encoding Retinoblastoma (RB)-binding proteins. UTX removes H3K27me3 and maintains expression of several RB-binding proteins. enabling cell cycle arrest. Genetic interactions in mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans show that UTX regulates cell fates via RB-dependent pathways. Thus. UTX defines an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to enable coordinate transcription of a RB network in cell fate control.,True,7de84zoAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,146,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/24/4/327.short,6614590108164580595,/scholar?cites=6614590108164580595,,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/24/4/327.full.pdf,0,0,0

By extending the Chemical-Shift Index to include 13Cα. 13Cβ and carbonyl 13C chemical shifts. it is now possible to use four independent chemical-shift measurements to identify and locate protein secondary structures. It is shown that by combining both 1H and 13C chemical-shift indices to produce a ‘consensus’ estimate of secondary structure. it is possible to achieve a predictive accuracy in excess of 92%.

Its unique focus on small molecules and the physiological effects of small molecules aligns the field of metabolomics very closely with the aims and interests of many researchers in the pharmaceutical industry. Because of its conceptual and technical overlap with many aspects of pharmaceutical research. metabolomics is now finding applications that span almost the full length of the drug discovery and development pipeline. from lead compound discovery to post-approval drug surveillance.

There are several software packages that support compound identification and quantification via 1D 1H NMR by spectral fitting techniques. Because 1D 1H NMR spectra are characterized by extensive peak overlap or spectral congestion. two-dimensional (2D) NMR. with its increased spectral resolution. could potentially improve and even automate compound identification or quantification. However. the lack of dedicated software for this purpose significantly restricts the application of 2D NMR methods to most metabolomic studies.

Now many secondary structure prediction methods routinely achieve an accuracy (Q3) of about 75%. We believe this accuracy could be further improved by including structure (as opposed to sequence) database comparisons as part of the prediction process. Indeed. given the large size of the Protein Data Bank (>35.000 sequences). the probability of a newly identified sequence having a structural homologue is actually quite high. We have developed a method that performs structure-based sequence alignments as part of the secondary structure prediction process. By mapping the structure of a known homologue (sequence ID >25%) onto the query protein's sequence. it is possible to predict at least a portion of that query protein's secondary structure. By integrating this structural alignment approach with conventional (sequence-based) secondary structure methods and then combining it with a ""jury-of-experts"" system to generate a consensus result. it is possible to attain very high prediction accuracy. Using a sequence-unique test set of 1644 proteins from EVA. this new method achieves an average Q3 score of 81.3%. Extensive testing indicates this is approximately 4–5% better than any other method currently available. Assessments using non sequence-unique test sets (typical of those used in proteome annotation or structural genomics) indicate that this new method can achieve a Q3 score approaching 88%.

Considerable interest in defining the toxic exposome has been spurred on by the realization that most human injuries. deaths and diseases are directly or indirectly caused by toxic substances found in the air. water. food. home or workplace. The Toxin-Toxin-Target Database (T3DB - www.t3db.ca) is a resource that was specifically designed to capture information about the toxic exposome. Originally released in 2010. the first version of T3DB contained data on nearly 2900 common toxic substances along with detailed information …,True,-JSn-WgAAAAJ:WHdLCjDvYFkC,150,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/43/D1/D928/2435303,11374867868673997279,/scholar?cites=11374867868673997279,,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/43/D1/D928/2435303,0,0,0

The relative ease of sample preparation. the ability to quantify metabolite levels. the high level of experimental reproducibility. and the inherently nondestructive nature of NMR spectroscopy have made it the preferred platform for long-term or large-scale clinical metabolomic studies. These advantages. however. are often outweighed by the fact that most other analytical techniques. including both LC-MS and GC-MS. are inherently more sensitive than NMR. with lower limits of detection typically being 10 to 100 times better. This review is intended to introduce readers to the field of NMR-based metabolomics and to highlight both the advantages and disadvantages of NMR spectroscopy for metabolomic studies. It will also explore some of the unique strengths of NMR-based metabolomics. particularly with regard to isotope selection/detection. mixture deconvolution via 2D spectroscopy. automation. and the ability to noninvasively analyze native tissue specimens.

The 8106 deaths were approximately evenly distributed over years 1. 2. 3. 4. and 5+ of follow-up. with little useful information beyond year 5.Systematic overviews of the results of these trials demonstrated reductions in mortality due to treatment that were significant when tamoxifen was compared with no tamoxifen (P<0.0001). any chemotherapy with no chemotherapy (P = 0.003). and polychemotherapy with single-agent chemotherapy (P = 0.001).

We aimed to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of auditory cues to improve gait in PD and cognitive impairment (PD‐CI). Nine participants with PD‐CI walked with and without auditory cues using two different strategies: (1) Cue with temporal instruction to “step in time to the beat.” (2) Cue with spatiotemporal instruction to “take a big step in time to the beat.” Cues were delivered with a metronome at preferred stepping frequency while on medication during single and dual‐task gait.

Proteins that enter the cell from the extracellular milieu (such as receptor-mediated endocytosed proteins) are degraded in lysosomes. Lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins occurs mostly under stressed conditions. Nonlysosomal mechanisms are responsible for the highly selective turnover of intracellular proteins that occurs under basal metabolic conditions. but also for some aspects of degradation of intracellular proteins under stress. An important nonlysosomal proteolytic pathway is the ubiquitin system in which proteins are degraded by a 26s protease complex following conjugation by multiple molecules of ubiquitin.

The ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p27 depend on its phosphorylation by cyclin–CDK complexes. However. the ubiquitin–protein ligase necessary for p27 ubiquitination has not been identified. Here we show that the F-box protein SKP2 specifically recognizes p27 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner that is characteristic of an F-box-protein–substrate interaction. Furthermore. both in vivo and in vitro. SKP2 is a rate-limiting component of the machinery that ubiquitinates and degrades phosphorylated p27.

Apotransferrin is quickly dissociated from its receptor when the pH is raised to 7.0. These and other results strongly support a simple model that explains the cycling of transferrin during a single cycle of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Diferric transferrin binds to cell-surface receptors. and the transferrin-receptor complex is endocytosed. The pH of the endocytic vesicle is lowered to 5.5 or below; this causes dissociation of iron from the transferrin-receptor complex. but apotransferrin remains bound to its receptor. The iron remains within the cell. and the apotransferrin-receptor complex is recycled to the cell surface.

Inc.,The ubiquitin proteolytic system plays an important role in a broad array of basic cellular processes. Among these are regulation of cell cycle. modulation of the immune and inflammatory responses. control of signal transduction pathways. development and differentiation. These complex processes are controlled via specific degradation of a single or a subset of proteins. Degradation of a protein by the ubiquitin system involves two successive steps. conjugation of multiple moieties of ubiquitin and degradation of the tagged protein by the 26S proteasome. An important question concerns the identity of the mechanisms that underlie the high degree of specificity of the system. Substrate recognition is governed by a large family ubiquitin ligases that recognize the substrates. bind them and catalyze/facilitate their interaction with ubiquitin.

Hdm2 is a member of the RING finger family of ubiquitin-protein ligases E3 and targets the tumor suppressor protein p53 for degradation. Although HdmX also binds to p53. HdmX does not induce p53 degradation. Moreover. HdmX has been reported to interfere with p53 degradation in overexpression experiments. To obtain insight into the mechanism by which HdmX interferes with p53 degradation. we studied the effect of HdmX on the E3 activity of Hdm2 in vitro. Surprisingly. this revealed that HdmX stimulates Hdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 and that HdmX facilitates ubiquitination of Hdm2 and vice versa. In addition. down-regulation of HdmX expression within cells results in the accumulation of both p53 and Hdm2.

Once attached to a substrate (monoubiquitination). ubiquitin can itself be ubiquitinated on any of its seven lysine (Lys) residues or its N-terminal methionine (Met1).

The diverse ways to assemble ubiquitin chains provide countless means to modulate biological processes.

Over the last years. a significant progress has been made in our understanding of how modification of the substrates of the ubiquitin system is regulated. However. little is known on how the ubiquitin system that is comprised of∼ 1500 components is regulated. Here. we discuss how the biggest subfamily within the system. that of the E3 ubiquitin ligases that endow the system with its high specificity towards the numerous substrates. is regulated and in particular via self-regulation mediated by ubiquitin modification.

It is a highly specific process that is time- (e.g. cell cycle). compartment- (e.g. nucleus or endoplasmic reticulum) and substrate quality- (e.g. denatured or misfolded proteins) dependent. and allows fast adaptation to changing conditions. Degradation by the UPS is carried out through two successive steps: the substrate is covalently tagged with ubiquitin and subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome. The accepted ‘canonical’ signal for proteasomal recognition is a polyubiquitin chain that is anchored to a lysine residue in the target substrate. and is assembled through isopeptide bonds involving lysine 48 of ubiquitin.

The recognition component of this pathway. called N-recognin or E3. binds to a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a substrate protein and participates in the formation of a substrate-linked multiubiquitin chain. We report the cloning of the mouse and human Ubr1 cDNAs and genes that encode a mammalian N-recognin called E3α. Mouse UBR1p (E3α) is a 1.757-residue (200-kDa) protein that contains regions of sequence similarity to the 225-kDa Ubr1p of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mouse and human UBR1p have apparent homologs in other eukaryotes as well. thus defining a distinct family of proteins. the UBR family. The residues essential for substrate recognition by the yeast Ubr1p are conserved in the mouse UBR1p.

We report that a large fraction of genomic ultraconserved regions (UCRs) encode a particular set of ncRNAs whose expression is altered in human cancers. Genome-wide profiling revealed that UCRs have distinct signatures in human leukemias and carcinomas. UCRs are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions involved in cancers. We identified certain UCRs whose expression may be regulated by microRNAs abnormally expressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia. and we proved that the inhibition of an overexpressed UCR induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells.

Deregulation of the TCL1 oncogene is a causal event in the pathogenesis of the aggressive form of this disease as was verified by using animal models. To study the mechanism of Tcl1 regulation in CLL. we carried out microRNA expression profiling of three types of CLL: indolent CLL. aggressive CLL. and aggressive CLL showing 11q deletion.

The causes of this disease are unknown. although it appears likely that genetic factors contribute to its development.

Mutations of the P53 tumor suppressor gene at 17q13 are uncommon except in advanced disease. Assessing for clinical stage and various prognostic markers can be useful in deciding when to initiate therapy. Treatment with chlorambucil. with or without prednisone. has been the mainstay of initial treatment. although recent studies confirm the high activity of deoxyadenosine analogs such as fludarabine in this disease.

The electron transfer rate of GOD is greatly enhanced to 7.73 s−1 in the system. which is more than one-fold higher than that of flavin adenine dinucleotide adsorbed on the carbon nanotubes (3.1 s−1). This maybe results from the conformational change of GOD in the microenvironment enabling the accessibility of active site for GOD to the electrode. Additionally. the bioactivity of GOD modified in the composite on electrode surface is kept. So as-prepared electrode can be used as a glucose biosensor exhibiting higher sensitivity (0.52 μA mM−1) and better stability.

In this article. we present a novel electrochemical strategy to nanoparticle-based catalyst design using the recently developed underpotential deposition (UPD) redox replacement technique. A single UPD Cu replacement with Pt2+ yielded a uniform Pt layer on colloid gold surfaces. The ultrathin (nominally monolayer-level) Pt coating of the novel nanostructured particles was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS).

This work reports a facile. one-step. solvothermal method for the synthesis of graphene-CdS and graphene-ZnS quantum dot nanocomposites directly from graphene oxide. with CdS and ZnS very well dispersed on the graphene nanosheets. Photoluminescence measurements showed that the integration of CdS and ZnS with graphene significantly decreases their photoluminescence.

Here. we report a novel alternative approach for preparing SPR-active substrates that is completely solution-based. Our strategy is based on self-assembly of the gold colloid monolayer on a (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane-modified glass slide. followed by electroless gold plating. Using this method. the thickness of films can be easily controlled at the nanometer scale by setting the plating time in the same conditions. Surface roughness and morphology of gold films can be modified by both tuning the size of gold nanoparticles and agitation during the plating. Surface evolution of the Au film was followed in real time by UV−vis spectroscopy and in situ SPRS.

The high density of edge-plane-like defective sites and high specific surface area of OMCs could be responsible for the electrocatalytic behavior at OMCs modified glassy carbon electrode (OMCs/GE). which induced a substantial decrease in the overpotential of NADH and H2O2 oxidation reaction compared to carbon nanotubes modified glassy carbon electrode (CNTs/GE). Such ability of OMCs permits effective low-potential amperometric biosensing of ethanol and glucose. respectively. at Nafion/ADH–OMCs/GE and Nafion/GOD–OMCs/GE.

In this strategy. an imidazolium salt-based ionic liquid (IS-IL)-functionalized graphene was synthesized by covalently binding 1-(3-aminopropyl)-3-methylimidazolium bromide onto graphene nanosheets. The introduction of IS-IL on the surface of graphene nanosheets can obtain dispersed graphene nanosheets with positive charge. Also. the desired functionalization of graphene can form the building blocks for constructing hybrid 3D nanocomposite film.

The p39/Jun protein is one of the major polypeptides identified in AP-1 oligonucleotide affinity chromatography extracts of cellular proteins. These preparations of AP-1 also contain Fos and several FRA9s. Some of these proteins bind to the AP-1 site directly whereas others. like Fos. appear to bind indirectly via protein-protein interactions.

From the earliest neuroanatomic studies of reeler. it was anticipated that the characterization of the gene responsible would elucidate important molecular and cellular principles governing cell positioning and the formation of synaptic circuits in the developing brain. Indeed. the identification of reelin has challenged many of our previous notions and has led to a new vision of the events involved in the migration of neurons. Several neuronal populations throughout the brain secrete Reelin. which binds to transmembrane receptors located on adjacent cells triggering a tyrosine kinase cascade. This allows neurons to complete migration and adopt their ultimate positions in laminar structures in the central nervous system.

Since the products of these genes include transcription factors and cytokines. they are proposed to be involved in coupling neuronal excitation to a complex. and poorly understood. programme of cellular responses that involves the regulation of gene expression. Products of two cellular immediate-early genes. c-fos and c-jun. are components of the transcription factor AP-1. In this review. Jim Morgan and Tom Curran discuss how these gene products have begun to reveal some of the molecular details of stimulus-transcription coupling in the nervous system following seizures.

We isolated a gene. reelin. that is mutated in reeler mice. The protein product of reelin has features of extracellular matrix components and it is expressed in a temporal and spatial pattern during embryonic and postnatal development consistent with the phenotypic defects in reeler mice. To understand the molecular basis of the function of Reelin. we constructed a full length reelin clone and used it to direct Reelin expression. Using this clone we found that Reelin is a secreted glycoprotein and that a highly charged C-terminal region is essential for secretion.

Dimer formation occurs through the leucine zipper. a structural motif involving a heptad repeat of leucine residues that is conserved in several fos-and jun-related genes. We have employed a novel cloning strategy to isolate genes encoding proteins capable of forming complexes with Jun.

Protein dimerization is mediated primarily by a coiled-coil-like structure termed the leucine-zipper and DNA binding occurs primarily through regions of each protein rich in basic amino acids that contact both strands of the AP-1 site 2–8. The precise nature of the protein–DNA interaction is unknown as studies concerned with dimerization and DNA binding by Fos and Jun have relied on indirect methods to investigate protein–protein–DNA interactions.

Dab1 is thought to function as an adapter molecule in signal transduction processes. It contains a protein-interaction (PI) domain similar to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of the Shc oncoprotein. it is phosphorylated by the Src protein tyrosine kinase. and it binds to SH2 domains in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. To investigate the function of Dab1. we searched for binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that the PI domain of Dab1 interacts with the amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1). The association of Dab1 with APLP1 was confirmed in biochemical assays. and the site of interaction was localized to a cytoplasmic region of APLP1 containing the amino acid sequence motif Asn-Pro-x-Tyr (NPxY).

To investigate Reelin function. we used the nestin promoter to express Reelin ectopically in the ventricular zone and other brain regions in transgenic mice. In the presence of the endogenous protein. ectopic Reelin did not alter cell migration in the neocortex or the cerebellum. However. in the reeler background. ectopic Reelin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab-1 in the ventricular zone and rescued some. but not all. of the neuroanatomic and behavioral abnormalities characteristic of reeler.

In PC12 cells. induction may be elicited either by membrane depolarization or by direct activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels with BAY K 8644 both of which provoke an influx of calcium.

In the brain. c-fos and c-jun may be induced by elevated neuronal activity such as occurs during pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) seizures. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) form of the glutamate receptor. which can directly gate calcium. plays a role in the induction of c-fos expression in PTZ seizures. In addition.

We have constructed c-Fos mutants with these serines changed to aspartic acid residues (FosD) to mimic phosphorylation or to alanine residues (FosA) to prevent phosphorylation. Cells expressing FosD exhibited a more extensive transformed phenotype than those expressing either FosA or wild type c-Fos (FosWT). We also observed that FosA has a reduced half-life in comparison with FosD in G1. Furthermore. we observed enhanced AP-1 transactivation activity in cells expressing FosD. These results indicate that phosphorylation of c-Fos at its extreme carboxyterminus. possibly by MAP kinase and RSK. supports the proliferative response by increasing c-Fos stability and/or by increasing its transactivation activity. Under conditions in which the MAP kinase pathway is constitutively activated. c-Fos phosphorylation probably contributes to cellular transformation.

The gene encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p18Ink4c is transiently expressed in mouse cerebellar granule neuronal precursor cells (GNPs) as they exit the cell division cycle and differentiate. Coinactivation of Ink4c and p53 provided cultured GNPs with an additive proliferative advantage. either in the presence or absence of Shh. and induced MB with low penetrance but with greatly increased incidence following postnatal irradiation.

We report that ApoE plays a role in facilitating the proteolytic clearance of soluble Aβ from the brain. The endolytic degradation of Aβ peptides within microglia by neprilysin and related enzymes is dramatically enhanced by ApoE. Similarly. Aβ degradation extracellularly by insulin-degrading enzyme is facilitated by ApoE. The capacity of ApoE to promote Aβ degradation is dependent upon the ApoE isoform and its lipidation status. The enhanced expression of lipidated ApoE. through the activation of liver X receptors. stimulates Aβ degradation.

10102143,The sounds of commerce: Marketing popular film music,1998,Jeff Smith,,,,,Columbia University Press,The Sounds of Commerce is the first book to present a detailed historical analysis of popular music in American film. from the era of sheet music sales. to that of orchestrated pop records by Henry Mancini and Ennio Morricone in the 1960? to the MTV-ready pop songs that occupy soundtrack CDs of today. Jeff Smith's landmark exploration of film and music cross-promotion investigates the combination of historical. economic. and aesthetic factors that brought about the rise of popular music in the movies. Smith employs a sophisticated yet accessible fusion of musicology. film theory. and social history. In one chapter. a musicological unpacking of the theme song from Goldfinger is used to show how the repeated refrain developed massive cultural appeal. leading to huge singles sales and a ubiquitous tune that most Americans can recognize several decades after the film's release. Other chapters look at how the film and music industries became so heavily intertwined. how soundtrack music progressed from orchestral score to pop song. and how certain soundtracks today become chart successes while their accompanying films generate scant box-office interest. Throughout the text. Smith persuasively argues that the popular film score has been as successful as its classical predecessor at enhancing emotions and moods. cueing characters and settings. and signifying psychological states and points of view. With The Sounds of Commerce. he challenges film music scholarship to recognize the significance of popular music in modern film.,True,QJvkNkQAAAAJ:xoH8P16vUNYC,451,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6131009053757797546&hl=en&oi=scholarr,6131009053757797546,/scholar?cites=6131009053757797546,,,0,0,0

10102191,Apolipoprotein E4: an allele associated with many diseases,2000,Jonathan D Smith,32,,2,118-127,Taylor & Francis,Apolipoprotein E (apoE) was discovered as a plasma protein involved in lipoprotein metabolism. ApoE is synthesized by the liver and is also made locally in the brain. There are three common variants of apoE. resulting from common genetic variation. called E2. E3 and E4. The E3 allele is the most prevalent form. and the proportion of the three alleles differs between populations. Epidemiological studies have found that the E4 allele is associated with decreased longevity. increased plasma cholesterol levels and increased prevalence for cardiovascular disease and particularly for Alzheimer's disease. The apoE polymorphism also affects response to head trauma. cognitive decline upon ageing and several other disorders.

The situation was even more dire in 2008. when 66.000 spawners are estimated to have returned to natural areas and hatcheries. For the SRFC stock. which is an aggregate of hatchery and natural production. many factors have been suggested as potential causes of the poor escapements. including freshwater withdrawals (including pumping of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta). unusual hatchery events. pollution. elimination of net-pen acclimatization facilities coincident with one of the two failed brood years. and large-scale bridge construction during the smolt outmigration (CDFG. 2008).

Since plasma ceramides are increased in NAFLD and sphingomyelin. a ceramide metabolite. is an independent risk factor for CVD. the role of ceramides in dyslipidemia was assessed using LDLR-/- mice. a diet-induced model of NAFLD and atherosclerosis. Mice were fed a standard or Western diet (WD). with or without myriocin. an inhibitor of ceramide synthesis. Hepatic and plasma ceramides were profiled and lipid and lipoprotein kinetics were quantified. Hepatic and intestinal expression of genes and proteins involved in insulin. lipid and lipoprotein metabolism were also determined. WD caused hepatic oxidative stress. inflammation. apoptosis. increased hepatic long-chain ceramides associated with apoptosis (C16 and C18) and decreased very-long-chain ceramide C24 involved in insulin signaling. The plasma ratio of ApoB/ApoA1 (proteins of VLDL/LDL and HDL) was increased 2-fold due to increased ApoB production. Myriocin reduced hepatic and plasma ceramides and sphingomyelin. and decreased atherosclerosis. hepatic steatosis. fibrosis. and apoptosis without any effect on oxidative stress. These changes were associated with decreased lipogenesis. ApoB production and increased HDL turnover.

The discovery of IgA and the realization that it dominates humoral mucosal immunity. in contrast to the IgG dominance of the systemic immune system. was early evidence for the distinct nature of mucosal immunology. It is now clear that IgA can function in high-affinity modes for neutralization of toxins and pathogenic microbes. and as a low-affinity system to contain the dense commensal microbiota within the intestinal lumen. The basic map of induction of IgA B cells in the Peyer's patches. which then circulate through the lymph and bloodstream to seed the mucosa with precursors of plasma cells that produce dimeric IgA for export through the intestinal epithelium. has been known for more than 30 years.

Most infections involve the mucosae. but the development of vaccines against many of these pathogens has yet to be successful. Mucosal vaccines would make immunization procedures easier. be better suited for mass administration. and most efficiently induce immune exclusion – a term coined for non‐inflammatory antibody shielding of internal body surfaces – mediated principally by secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). The exported antibodies are polymeric. mainly IgA dimers (pIgA) – produced by local plasma cells stimulated by antigens that target the mucosae. SIgA was early shown to be complexed with an epithelial glycoprotein – the secretory component (SC). In 1974. a common SC‐dependent transport of pIgA and pentameric IgM was proposed.

Mucosa‐associated lymphoid tissue gives rise to B cells with striking J‐chain expression that are seeded to secretory effector sites. Such preferential homing constitutes the biological basis for local production of polymeric immunoglobulin A (pIgA) and pentameric IgM with high affinity to the epithelial pIg receptor that readily can export these antibodies to the mucosal surface. This ultimate functional goal of mucosal B‐cell differentiation appears to explain why the J chain is also expressed by IgG‐ and IgD‐producing plasma cells (PCs) occurring at secretory tissue sites; these immunocytes may be considered as ‘spin‐offs’ from early effector clones that through class switch are on their way to pIgA production.

Local generation of secretory IgA (SIgA) constitutes the largest humoral immune system of the body. Secretory antibodies function both by performing antigen exclusion at mucosal surfaces and by virus and endotoxin neutralization within epithelial cells without causing tissue damage. SIgA is thus persistently containing commensal bacteria outside the epithelial barrier but can also target invasion of pathogens and penetration of harmful antigens. Resistance to toxin-producing bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli appears to depend largely on SIgA. and so does herd protection against horizontal faecal–oral spread of enteric pathogens under naïve or immunized conditions—with a substantial innate impact both on …,True,oNu3sYsAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,448,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06013053,18321145588160686833,/scholar?cites=18321145588160686833,,,0,0,0

However. the mucosal immune system is more complex than the systemic counterpart. both in terms of anatomy (inductive and effector tissues) and effectors (cells and molecules). Therefore. immunologists entering this field need a precise terminology as a crucial means of communication.

Antigen-stimulated lymphoid follicles give rise to: (a) clonal B-cell expansion; (b) B-cell receptor affinity maturation; (c) positive selection of B cells according to receptor affinity for antigen; (d) differentiation to B memory cells and plasma cells; and (e) variable induction of the joining (J)-chain gene. B-cell differentiation is also important to promote downstream isotype switching of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain constant genes. For tonsillar B cells. this process gives rise mainly to IgG and IgA plasma cells. partially associated with J-chain expression. Because the J chain is a key peptide in the polymer structure of secretory IgA. tonsils and adenoids may provide B cells for mucosal effector sites.

However. the neonatal period is particularly critical in terms of mucosal defense. with regard to infections and priming for allergic disease. This is so because the intestinal barrier function provided by secretory antibodies. as well as the immunoregulatory network. is poorly developed for a variable period after birth. Notably. the postnatal development of mucosal immune homeostasis depends on the establishment of a normal commensal microbial flora and also on adequate timing and dose of dietary antigens when first introduced. In this context. breastfeeding apears to exert both shielding and positive regulatory effects.

Both pIgA and pentameric IgM contain a binding site for the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR). or secretory component (SC). which is a requirement for their active external transport through secretory epithelia. The pIgR/SC binding site depends on covalent incorporation of the J chain into the quaternary structure of the polymers when they are produced by the local immunocytes.

Specific secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) can inhibit initial pathogen colonization by performing immune exclusion both on the mucosal surface and within virus-infected secretory epithelial cells without causing tissue damage. Resistance against toxin-producing bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae appears to be particularly dependent on SIgA antibodies.

These mucosal surfaces are generally covered by a physically vulnerable mono-layered epithelium. which is constantly exposed to potentially infectious agents such as bacteria. viruses. fungi and parasites. as well as potentially harmful soluble molecules from the diet or the environment. Not surprisingly. most human disease-causing microbes use the mucosae as their portal of entry. Facing these exogenous challenges. numerous innate defence mechanisms have developed that co-operate intimately with a local adaptive immune system to inhibit epithelial colonization by pathogens and penetration of harmful substances. Thisfirst line'of specific immunologic defence is mainly provided by secretory IgA (SIgA) and to some extent secretory IgM (SIgM) antibodies that are actively transported to mucosal secretions [1]. Paracellular passive transfer of IgG antibodies may also provide mucosal protection. particularly at sites with little proteolytic activity such as the respiratory and reproductive tracts [1]. Recently. a bidirectional transport mechanism for IgG was demonstrated in a human intestinal epithelial cell line [2]. raising the possibility that IgG may also be actively transferred to secretions.Secretory antibodies have their basis in local production of polymeric IgA (pIgA especially dimers and some larger polymers) and to a lesser extent pentameric IgM by B-cell blasts and plasma cells (collectively called immunocytes).

A similar dose-response relationship was observed when we examined the binding of polymeric IgA to HT-29 cells treated with IFN-gamma. thus reflecting expression of functional SC. Because IFN-gamma is produced by T cells during immune responses. activated T cells may be able to promote the external transport of dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM and thereby enhance the efferent limb of the secretory immune system.

Generation of SIgA and secretory IgM (SIgM) in exocrine glands and mucous membranes depends on a fascinating cooperation between local plasma cells that produce polymeric IgA (plgA. mainly dimers and some larger polymers) and pentameric IgM. and secretory epithelial cells that express the polymeric Ig receptor (plgR)—also known as transmembrane secretory component. After release from the local plasma cells and diffusion through the stroma. plgA and pentameric IgM become readily bound to plgR. and are then actively transported across secretory epithelial cells for extrusion into external secretions after cleavage of plgR.

10102285,Secretory IgA: designed for anti-microbial defense,2013,Per Brandtzaeg,4,,,222,Frontiers,Prevention of infections by vaccination remains a compelling goal to improve public health. Mucosal vaccines would make immunization procedures easier. be better suited for mass administration. and most efficiently induce immune exclusion -- a term coined for non-inflammatory antibody shielding of internal body surfaces. mediated principally by secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). The exported antibodies are polymeric. mainly IgA dimers (pIgA). produced by local plasma cells stimulated by antigens that target the mucosae. SIgA was early shown to be complexed with an epithelial glycoprotein -- the secretory component (SC). A common SC-dependent transport mechanism for pIgA and pentameric IgM was then proposed. implying that membrane SC acts as a receptor. now usually called the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR). From the basolateral surface. pIg-pIgR complexes are taken up by endocytosis and then extruded into the lumen after apical cleavage of the receptor -- bound SC having stabilizing and innate functions in the secretory antibodies. Mice deficient for pIgR show that this is the only receptor responsible for epithelial export of IgA and IgM. These knockout mice show a variety of defects in their mucosal defensce and changes in their intestinal microbiota. In the gut. induction of B cells occurs in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). particularly the Peyer’s patches and isolated lymphoid follicles. but also in mesenteric lymph nodes.

Therefore. SIgA is a potential candidate for therapeutic administration. but its complex structure with four different polypeptide chains produced by two distinct cell types complicates recombinant production.

Nevertheless. insufficient knowledge exists about the uptake. processing. and presentation of luminal antigens occurring in GALT to accomplish priming and sustained expansion of mucosal B cells. Also. it is unclear how the germinal center reaction so strikingly promotes class switch to IgA and expression of J chain. although the commensal microbiota appears to contribute to both diversification and memory. B-cell migration from GALT to the intestinal lamina propria is guided by rather well-defined adhesion molecules and chemokines/chemokine receptors. but the cues directing homing to secretory effector sites beyond the gut require better definition.

10102325,Food allergy: separating the science from the mythology,2010,Per Brandtzaeg,7,,7,380-400,Nature Publishing Group,Numerous genes are involved in innate and adaptive immunity and these have been modified over millions of years. During this evolution. the mucosal immune system has developed two anti-inflammatory strategies: immune exclusion by the use of secretory antibodies to control epithelial colonization of microorganisms and to inhibit the penetration of potentially harmful agents; and immunosuppression to counteract local and peripheral hypersensitivity against innocuous antigens. such as food proteins. The latter strategy is called oral tolerance when induced via the gut. Homeostatic mechanisms also dampen immune responses to commensal bacteria. The mucosal epithelial barrier and immunoregulatory network are poorly developed in newborns. The perinatal period is. therefore. critical with regard to the induction of food allergy.

In the Syrian hamster the duration of photoperiod affects the amplitude of gene expression in the PT. and melatonin administered before lights‐on suppressed the peak of Per1/ICER expression; these effects were not seen in the SCN. It was speculated that the inefficacy of melatonin was due to the low density of melatonin receptors in the SCN of this species. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this phenomenon also occurs in the Siberian hamster. which expresses a higher density of melatonin receptors in the SCN. Male Siberian hamsters were housed in long days (16 h light : 8 h dark) or short days (8 h light : 16 h dark) and expression of Per1 and ICER mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization.

Although MSCs from different tissues have similar levels of surface antigen expression. immunosuppressive activity. and differentiation ability. UCB-MSCs had the highest rate of cell proliferation and clonality. and significantly lower expression of p53. p21. and p16. well known markers of senescence. Since paracrine action is the main action of MSCs. we examined the anti-inflammatory activity of each MSC under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation. Co-culture of UCB-MSCs with LPS-treated rat alveolar macrophage. reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1α (IL-1α). IL-6. and IL-8 via angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1). Using recombinant Ang-1 as potential soluble paracrine factor or its small interference RNA (siRNA). we found that Ang-1 secretion was responsible for this beneficial effect in part by preventing inflammation.

For comparative purposes. the effects of various surface modifications such as mild oxidation. plasma treatment. and gamma-ray irradiation on the electrochemical properties of carbon felt electrodes were investigated at optimized conditions. The cell energy efficiency was improved from 68 to 75% after the mild oxidation of the carbon felt at 500 °C for 5 h. This efficiency improvement could be attributed to the increased surface area of the carbon felt electrode and the formation of functional groups on its surface as a result of the modification.

To identify the factors. which can be used for predicting cholangiocarcinomas in patients with hepatolithiasis. we compared the clinical characteristics of patients who had cholangiocarcinoma associated with hepatolithiasis with those of patients with hepatolithiasis only. METHODOLOGY: Forty patients with cholangiocarcinoma associated with hepatolithiasis (group HC) and 73 patients with hepatolithiasis only (group H) were randomly selected for this study. Mean tumor size was 6.1+/-2.4 cm in diameter. RESULTS: Patients of group HC were older (56.7+/-8.9 yr) than those of group H (49.2+/-12.9 yr)(p< 0.001). Weight loss was more frequent in group HC (51.5%) than in group H (5.5%)(p< 0.001) and serum alkaline phosphatase levels were higher in group HC (181+/-184 IU/L) than in group H (426+/-385 IU/L)(p< 0.001).

The LED structures showed superior optical output power. which directly resulted from not only effective elimination of threading dislocation of the epitaxial layers but also significant increase in light extraction efficiency via the inclined facets of aligned micropits.,True,hKDB82cAAAAJ:uPwIINvFgpoC,113,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2714203,1037091588885968079,/scholar?cites=1037091588885968079,,,0,0,0

We found that the tandem C2 domain of Rabphilin3a specifically bound lipid vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 4.5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4.5)P2) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. There was little binding to vesicles containing PtdIns(3.4)P2 in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Binding to phosphatidylinositol 3.4.5-triphosphate-containing vesicles was similar to binding to PtdIns(4.5)P2-containing vesicles. The presence of physiological amounts of phosphatidylserine (PS) greatly potentiated the ability of PtdIns(4.5)P2 to cause vesicle binding. As with the C2 domains together. the binding of individual C2 domain of Rabphilin3a was much greater to PtdIns(4.5)P2-containing vesicles than PtdIns(3.4)P2-containing vesicles.

Inc., This study proposes a crack‐monitoring system to quantify the change of cracks from multitemporal images during the monitoring period. A series of images were taken from an off‐the‐shelf digital camera. Concrete cracks were extracted from the digital images by employing a series of image‐processing techniques. The image coordinates and orientation of same cracks can be changed since the position and direction of the portable camera vary at every exposure time. To monitor the crack changes (width and length). it is critical to transform the image coordinates of cracks extracted from each image into the same object coordinates of the concrete surface. In this study. such a geometric relationship was automatically recovered using the two‐dimensional (2D) projective transformation based on the modified iterated Hough transform (MIHT) algorithm. the result of which solved the transformation parameters.

The decreased activity and mass were temporally related to an increase in plasma and high density lipoprotein (HDL) lipid hydroperoxides and to a decrease in HDL cholesterol and native apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II). As the native apoA-I protein disappeared from the circulation. higher molecular weight forms of apoA-I appeared. some of which contained epitopes recognized by an antibody (EO6) that recognizes oxidized phospholipids. After mice consumed an atherogenic diet for 1 or 3 days. switching the mice to a low fat chow diet for 3 days resulted in a return to baseline levels of lipid hydroperoxides but only a small return toward …,True,hKDB82cAAAAJ:Kb2XK_T5ZYAC,98,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.atv.20.8.1946,379641545732379579,/scholar?cites=379641545732379579,,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.ATV.20.8.1946,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Intramural ectopic pregnancy is a very rare diagnosis. Establishing a diagnosis is difficult and is often made intraoperatively. Demonstration of a live extrauterine gestation is the only specific sign of such a pregnancy. A small number of ectopic pregnancies are interstitial or cornual pregnancies. Rupture of an intramural ectopic pregnancy is a serious clinical complication. Diagnosis of this ectopic pregnancy can sometimes be made using 2‐dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (TVS). but it may also require 3‐dimensional TVS. We present the case of a 25‐year‐old gravida 0. para 0 woman with amenorrhea lasting 6+5 weeks. Previous surgery included a right adnexectomy for torsion of a right dermoid cyst.

This study was to analyze the cyclin B1. cdc2. p53 and p16 tumor suppressor genes in human breast cancer. Materials and Methods: To investigate the role of cyclin B1. cdc2. p53 and p16 in the pathogenesis and progression of breast carcinomas. 98 cases of breast cancers were examined by immunohistochemical method. The correlations of cyclin B1. cdc2. p53 and p16 expression with various clinico-pathologic findings were analysed. Results: In the normal breast tissues. cyclin B1. cdc2 and p16 were weakly expressed. while p53 was not expressed. On the other hand. cyclin B1. cdc2. p53 and p16 were overexpressed in breast cancer. showing correlation between the expression of cyclin B1 and cdc2 and breast cancers (p= 0.00). The overexpressions of cdc2 and p16 were correlated with an infiltrative tumor border pattern and this was statistically significant (p< 0.05). In addition. the overexpression of cdc2 was correlated with histologic high grade carcinomas (p= 0.00). Conclusion: Cyclin B1 and cdc2 appeared to be involved in the genesis or progression of breast cancers. In addition. the overexpressions of p16 and p53 may play important roles in more aggressive tumor and the overexpression of cdc2 is associated with progression of tumor to a higher grade of breast carcinomas.

While the underlying cause of this cell death is poorly understood. oxidative stress is thought to play a role. We have previously shown that tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). an obligatory co‐factor for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). exerts selective toxicity on dopamine‐producing cells and that this is prevented by antioxidants. This study shows that BH4‐induced dopaminergic cell death is primarily mediated by dopamine. evidenced by findings that (i) BH4 toxicity is increased in proportion to cellular dopamine content; (ii) non‐dopaminergic cells become susceptible to BH4 upon exposure to dopamine; and (iii) depletion of dopamine attenuates BH4 toxicity in dopamine‐producing cells.

10102432,Arms races between and within species,1979,Richard Dawkins and John Richard Krebs,205,Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B. Biological Sciences,1161,489-511,The Royal Society,An adaptation in one lineage (e. g. predators) may change the selection pressure on another lineage (e. g. prey). giving rise to a counter-adaptation. If this occurs reciprocally. an unstable runaway escalation or ‘arms race’ may result. We discuss various factors which might give one side an advantage in an arms race. For example. a lineage under strong selection may out-evolve a weakly selected one (‘the life-dinner principle’). We then classify arms races in two independent ways.

10102433,Animal signals: information or manipulation,1978,Richard Dawkins and John R Krebs,2,Behavioural ecology: An evolutionary approach,,282-309,,"Because of the way natural selection works. it is reasonable for us to picture an animal as a machine designed to preserve and propagate the genes that ride inside it (Dawkins 1976). As a means to this end it will often manipulate objects in its world. pushing them around to its own advantage. Some of these objects will themselves be living creatures-mates. parents. prey. rivals-each one a machine designed to propagate its own genes in similar ways. When an animal seeks to manipulate an inanimate object. it has only one recourse-physical power. A dung beetle can move a ball of dung only by forcibly pushing it. But when the object it seeks to manipulate is itself another live animal there is an alternative way. It can exploit the senses and muscles of the animal it is trying to control. sense organs and behaviour machinery which are themselves designed to preserve the genes of that other animal. A male-t cricket does not physically roll a female along the ground and into his burrow. He sits and sings. and the female comes to him under her own power. From his point of view this communication is energetically more efficient than trying to take her by force. Cullen (1972) uses a human analogy to illustrate the distinction between force and communication.'... to a man the command"" Go jump in the lake"" is a signal. the push which precipitates him is not'. Making a similar point Wilson (1975) cites JBS Haldane's remark that'a general property of communication is the pronounced energetic efficiency of signalling: a small effort put into the signal typically elicits an energetically greater response'.

Parus major L.,1971,John R Krebs,52,Ecology,1,2-22,Ecological Society of America,This paper describes an investigation into whether or not spring territorial behavior was limiting the breeding density of a population of Great Tits on Wytham Estate. near Oxford. The analysis of distances between neighboring nests showed that nest sites were more spaced out than would be expected from a random distribution; this indicated that interactions between the birds produced at least a local density—limiting effect. In 2 successive years. established territorial pairs were removed from a stable spring population in mixed woodland. The removed birds were rapidly replaced by new pairs. These newcomers were largely first—year birds; they came from territories in the hedgerows that surrounded the wood; the vacated hedgerow territories were not refilled. The hedgerows were found to be suboptimal in terms of reproductive success. Thus territory limited the breeding density in the optimal habitat.

Retrieval of stored food relies on an accurate and long-lasting spatial memory. and hippocampal damage disrupts memory for storage sites. The results suggest. therefore. that food-storing species of passerines have an enlarged hippocampal complex as a specialization associated with the use of a specialized memory capacity.

Animals must find and consume resources to succeed. and they make extraordinary efforts to do so. For instance. pythons rarely eat. but when they do. their meals are large—as much as 60 percent larger than their own bodies. The snake’s digestive system is normally dormant. but during digestion metabolic rates can increase fortyfold. A python digesting quietly on the forest floor has the metabolic rate of thoroughbred in a dead heat. This and related foraging processes have broad applications in ecology. cognitive science. anthropology. and conservation biology—and they can be further extrapolated in economics. neurobiology. and computer science. Foraging is the first comprehensive review of the topic in more than twenty years. A monumental undertaking. this volume brings together twenty-two experts from throughout the field to offer the latest on the mechanics of foraging. modern foraging theory. and foraging ecology.

In this paper we examine this question using captive black-capped chickadees foraging in a large aviary for small pieces of mealworm hidden in artificial pine cones. The results of our experiments show the following: (a) when the birds encounter a long sequence of patches (groups of pine cones) each containing the same number of prey. they do not learn to expect a fixed number of prey per patch (Gibb's hypothesis of hunting by expectation); (b) similarly. the birds do not learn to spend constant time on each patch (although the data on this are less clear cut); (c) the birds have a constant giving-up time (interval between last catch and leaving the patch) for all types of patches within an environment. and the giving-up time is inversely related to the average capture rate …,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,615,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347274900189,14973957604899264154,/scholar?cites=14973957604899264154,,https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&context=biol_fsp,0,0,0

When two pairs are manipulated in this way into occupying the same territory an escalated contest ensures. Contests between residents and replacements are longer. more likely to involve physical fights and longer fights or displays than contests between established neighbours or residents and intruders. The degree of escalation between residents and replacements is an increasing function of replacement time. It rises to a peak and then diminishes again. The probability that the replacement will defeat the former resident is an increasing function of replacement time. reaching 90% after several days.

Some properties of the spatial memory involved were analyzed in 2 studies with 4 wild-caught marsh tits. In Exp I. Ss were offered 97 sites for storing 12 seeds. They recovered a median of 65% of them 2–3 hrs later. making only 2 errors/seed while doing so. Over trials. they used some sites more often than others. but during recovery they were more likely to visit a site of any preference value if they had stored a seed there that day than if they had not. Recovery performance was much worse if the experimenters moved the seeds between storage and recovery. A fixed search strategy that had some of the same average properties as the Ss' search behavior also did worse than the real birds.

I then propose an alternative idea. that song repertoires in some species have evolved in the context of density assessment. In the great tit. non-territorial birds use the song of residents as a cue in assessing density. and I suggest that repertoires are used by resident birds to increase the apparent density of singing residents. and hence decrease the apparent suitability of the area to new birds.

10102462,On the evolution of hoarding behaviour,1978,Malte Andersson and John Krebs,26,Animal Behaviour,,707-711,Academic Press,We discuss some simple models of food storing in which we aim to identify the factors influencing the evolution of hoarding behaviour. When an individual stores food in a defended territory. the net benefit derived from hoarding depends on the cost of storing. the probability of recovering a stored item. its food value. and the multiplication rate of non-hoarded items. When hoarders live in a group. an additional cost may arise from ‘cheaters’. who do not store food themselves but parasitize the caches made by other individuals. Hoarding in this context can be adaptive if a hoarder is more likely than any other group member to recover its own items. This could come about either because individuals remember their own caching sites. or if individuals differ in their preferred foraging sites and cache food in their own kind of place. We also discuss conditions for the existence of a stable mixture of hoarders and cheaters in a …,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,295,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347278901379,1364905738593762774,/scholar?cites=1364905738593762774,,,0,0,0

In addition. I review briefly two approaches which have been taken in studying predator behavior at a more general level: experimental component analysis and optimal foraging theory. I make no attempt to review comprehensively the literature on behavior of predators.The concept of hunting by searching image has been used in a great variety of senses. and to be of value it should be used in a more restricted manner.

10102464,The evolution of alarm calls: altruism or manipulation?,1975,Eric L Charnov and John R Krebs,109,The American Naturalist,965,107-112,University of Chicago Press,In many species of passerine birds a member of a flock gives a special alarm call when it sees an aerial predator (Thorpe 1961). The whole flock immediately takes off and heads for cover. The birds freeze if they are already in cover. This phenomenon has been discussed from an evolutionary point of view (Maynard Smith 1965; Trivers 1971; Williams 1970; Emlen 1973). since it apparently is a classic case of altruistic behavior. Altruism means that the act of calling increases the survival chances of nearby conspecifics while placing the caller in greater immediate danger. If the members of the flock are closely related. altruistic calling can evolve through kin selection (Hamilton 1964). However. alarm calls are given not just in the presence of close kin. but also outside the breeding season after migration and dispersal (Trivers 1971).

10102467,Foraging behavior,2012,Alan C Kamil and John R Krebs and H Ronald Pulliam,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Foraging behavior has always been a central concern of ecology. Understanding what animals eat is clearly an essential component of under standing many ecological issues including energy flow. competition and adaptation. Theoretical and empirical developments in the late 1960's and 1970's led to a new emphasis in the study of foraging behavior. the study of individual animals in both field and laboratory. This development. in turn. led to an explosion of interest in foraging. Part of the reason for this explosion is that when foraging is studied at the individual level. it is relevant to many disciplines. Behaviorists. including ethologists and psychologists. are interested in any attempt to understand behavior. Ecologists know that a better understanding of foraging will contribute to resolving a number of important ecological issues. Anthropologists and others are applying the ideas coming out of the study of foraging behavior to problems within their disciplines. These developments led to a multidisciplinary symposium on foraging behavior. held as part of the 1978 Animal Behavior Society meetings in Seattle. Washington. Many ecologists. ethologists and psychologists participated or attended. The symposium was very successful. generating a high level of excitement. As a result. the participants decided to publish the proceedings of the symposium (Kami1 & Sargent 1981).,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC,266,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=TxXlBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA5&dq=info:akOS-05Ra88J:scholar.google.com&ots=e9HzIks9tj&sig=HRGu_k3Da8a4Zub_ej4bE0VloF8,14946129188029088618,/scholar?cites=14946129188029088618,,,0,0,0

It can affect population structure (see Chapter 15) as well as the distribution of animals over habitats [Lima Er Zollner. 1996; see Chapter 16}. The goal of this chapter is to introduce behavioural ecologists to a diverse set of questions concerning information use by animals. The chapter explores how an animal's ecology affects the way it gathers. stores and processes information. It asks questions about the types of information acquired (but. see also Chapter 2) and the temporal scale of their effects on behaviour. Section 3.2 reviews information usage as it concerns resource estimation problems while Section 3.3 deals with its use in a pre-detection context. Subsequent sections deal with what some argue to be specialized forms of information use. Section 3.4 considers the extensive comparative research on spatial memory. especially in the context of avian food caching. Section 3.5 explores social learning that involves the use of information produced by other individuals (public infonnation). Section 3.6 deals with cultural transmission of information. paying special attention to the factors that promote or retard the cultural transmission of behavioural innovations.

The lack of interocular transfer in birds for some visual tasks provided a test for the hypothesis that memory is used to relocate stored food. After storing food with one eye covered. marsh tits did not return to storage sites when using only the ‘naive’ eye. but did so when using only the eye uncovered during storage.

There may also be some weak density‐dependent mortality outside the breeding season. The density‐dependent variations in clutch size are probably in the main due to shortage of available food and density‐dependent hatching failure is caused by predation. Territorial behaviour has been shown experimentally to determine breeding density. and may produce a density‐dependent effect outside the breeding season. These three factors are responsible for regulation of the Great tit population in Marley Wood.,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,184,https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1970.tb01268.x,17617890334921109169,/scholar?cites=17617890334921109169,,,0,0,0

10102487,Song and territory in the Great tit Parus major,1977,JR Krebs,,,,47-62,Palgrave. London,It is common knowledge that bird song has one or both of two functions: territorial advertisement and mate attraction (Thorpe. 1961; Armstrong. 1973). However. beyond the simple correlation between the seasonal peak of singing and territorial or reproductive activity. there is remarkably little direct evidence for either proposed function of song. Here I am concerned with the role of song in territorial behaviour in the Great tit (Parus major). The spring peak of singing coincides with the establishment of a territory. which occurs after pairing in the Great tit (Hinde. 1952; Krebs. 1971). perhaps indicating that mate attraction is less important than territorial advertisement in this particular species. The question I attempt to answer is ‘Does song act as a signal to keep intruders out of a territory?’. I also discuss how the organisation of song might relate to territorial exclusion.,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,173,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-05226-4_6,6077861511290323426,/scholar?cites=6077861511290323426,,,0,0,0

We suggest that one reason why small temperate‐zone birds such as Great Tits do not forage but sing when they get up in the morning is because low ambient temperatures reduce prey activity and hence the profitability of foraging.,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,150,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1984.tb03661.x,15189278774972235881,/scholar?cites=15189278774972235881,,,0,0,0

In two experiments. we tested the hypothesis that Great Tits (Parus major) adjust their fat reserves in response to feeding conditions. Experiment 1 tested the effect of a change in mean time at which food became available in the morning. Experiment 2 tested the effect of unpredictability in the onset of feeding time. 2. In experiment 1. Great Tits increased their morning mass after the start of feeding was delayed by 3 h and decreased their mass when original conditions were restored. The response to shortened feeding day was more rapid than the response to lengthened day. On shortened feeding days. birds gained mass while eating less. suggesting that they reduced their expenditures. 3. In experiment 2. birds gained more mass per day during the unpredictable than during the constant treatment. 4.

10102504,Habituation and song repertoires in the great tit,1976,JR Krebs,1,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,2,215-227,Springer-Verlag,This paper is concerned with the idea that the song repertoires of passerine birds are an evolutionary adaptation to reduce habituation in listeners. In an experiment involving 16 territorial males I played either a single song or a repertoire of songs for 15 two-min trials through a single loudspeaker near the edge of the territory. In a second experiment with 10 birds I played the songs through one of two loudspeakers in different parts of the territory. alternating between loudspeakers on successive trials. The birds tended to habituate more rapidly to single song playback than to repertoires. In the second experiment the overall level of habituation was lower and the difference between the two treatments was less marked.Two features of song repertoire organisation are consistent with the habituation hypothesis (1) the avoidance of low recurrence intervals in switches between song types. and (2) the fact …,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,143,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00299198,3871084769817107989,/scholar?cites=3871084769817107989,,,0,0,0

The basic physiology and morphology of Homo sapiens sets boundaries to our eating habits. but within these boundaries human food preferences are remarkably varied. both within and between populations. This does not mean that variation is entirely cultural or learned. because genes and culture may coevolve to determine variation in dietary habits. This coevolution has been well elucidated in some cases. such as lactose tolerance (lactase persistence) in adults. but is less well understood in others. such as in favism in the Mediterranean and other regions.

Network models have been criticized for the lack of realism of their individual components. and because the architectures required by some neural-network algorithms do not seem to exist in real nervous systems. In three related papers published in the 1970s. David Marr proposed that the cerebellum. the neocortex and the hippocampus each acts as a memorizing device. These theories were intended to satisfy the biological constraints. but in computational terms they are underdetermined.

10102510,Optimal foraging in patchy environments,1979,RICHARD J Cowie and JOHN R Krebs,,Population dynamics,,183-205,Blackwell Oxford,Two of the major biological factors affecting population dynamics are competition and predation. Competition is a symmetrical process in that both competitors are adversely affected and this tends to result in the evolution of mechanisms which reduce the interaction. Predation. on the other hand. is directional in that only the predator benefits from the association. This leads to an evolutionary'race'resulting in the development of efficient predators and elusive prey. In this paper we will be examining one of the ways in which predators are adapted to forage efficiently. In particular. how they cope with the exploitation of patchily distributed prey populations. A common feature of many animal populations is that individuals are not distributed homogeneously throughout the environment but occur in groups. There are a number of reasons why this is so. which include: their resources may be clumped causing them. for example. to congregate in areas of high food availability or suitable habitat; living in groups may provide protection from predators. eg the selfish herd effect (Hamilton 1971). or reduce the risk of being found (eg Brock & Riffenburg 1960); they may need to come together in groups to reproduce (eg Parker 1978). However. for whatever reason animals occur in groups or clumps. this grouping poses a problem for potential predators. In order to exploit clumped prey efficiently ap redator needs to decide (1) which areas or'patches' to visit and (2) when to move from one patch to another. where we define the term'patch'as the area containing the clump of prey items. This could be a natural unit such as a pine cone containing insect larvae or a bush …,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,135,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3367307379648924850&hl=en&oi=scholarr,3367307379648924850,/scholar?cites=3367307379648924850,,,0,0,0

An individual's perception of predation risk may depend on many factors. such as distance to refuge and group size. but it is unclear whether individuals respond to different factors in a similar manner. We tested whether flocks of foraging starlings responded in the same way to an increased perception of predation risk by assessing three factors: (1) neighbor distances. (2) habitat obstruction. and (3) recent exposure to a predator. We found that in all three scenarios of increased risk. starlings reduced their interscan intervals (food-searching bouts). which increased the frequency of their vigilance periods. We then examined how one of these factors. habitat obstruction. affected escape speed by simulating an attack with a model predator.

10102515,Distribution of birds amongst habitats: theory and relevance to conservation,1991,CARLOS Bernstein and JOHN R Krebs and ALEX Kacelnik,317,Bird population studies: relevance to conservation and management,,345,Oxford University Press,In this article we will review certain models of the distribution of animals between adjacent habitats or patches. The introduction explains how the models discussed in the later part of the paper might be relevant to the conservation and management of bird populations. The pivotal importance of patchiness in the ecology of individuals. populations. and communities is now widely recognized (eg May and Southwood 1990). In the particular context of conservation. the general question of distribution of animals between neighbouring habitats or patches arises from the fact that conservationists are often able to set aside only a small patch within a larger framework of different kinds of habitat. whilst animals may be able to move between habitat patches. For example in the Camargue a small proportion of freshwater marshes are set aside as protected areas for wildfowl. whilst the majority of marshes and other habitat types are open to exploitation by hunters. In order to understand the consequences of this conservation strategy for the species one is trying to conserve. it is crucial to know how populations in patches of conserved habitat interact with those from neighbouring. non-protected areas. The example of freshwater marshes in the Camargue can be used to illustrate a range of possibilities. First. populations in the protected marsh and in adjacent patches of habitat might be independent entities. so that the conserved populations can be maintained without regard to the rest of the environment round about. Another possibility is that the populations in the conserved marsh are sustained only by immigration from surrounding areas. in which case …,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,127,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16525784762119774059&hl=en&oi=scholarr,16525784762119774059,/scholar?cites=16525784762119774059,,,0,0,0

Further comparisons between groups of differing age and experience of migration suggested that both experience and age during the first year have an effect of relative hippocampal volume.

Great tits respond more strongly to undegraded than to degraded songs when both are played at the same amplitude and from the same position in the territory. This difference in response is shown only if the playback song is “familiar” to the test bird; familiar songs being those sung either by the test bird or neighbours of the test bird. We interpret these results as evidence that cues from song degradation can be used to estimate the distance of a singing conspecific and that degradation assessment is only possible if the bird has an internal representation of the song (because either it and/or a neighbour sings the song).

Captive great tits were presented with a mixture of two kinds of prey on a moving belt attached to the front of a cage.

In our experiments one prey was cryptic because it closely resembled inedible `twigs' which were also on the moving belt. The birds could not distinguish visually between this kind of prey and twigs without first picking up the item and inspecting it.

P. major,1990,John R Krebs and Susan D Healy and Sara J Shettleworth,39,Animal Behaviour,6,1127-1137,Academic Press,The performances of the coal tit (a food storer) and the great tit (a non-storer) were compared in two experiments in which the bird was rewarded in phase 2 of a trial for returning to sites where it had seen food in phase 1 (‘window-shopping’). In both experiments the differences in performance between the species were small. In the first experiment the storing species was better than the non-storer at returning to the site where it had seen a seed. and in the second experiment the storing species was better at discriminating in phase 2 between sites visited in phase 1 that contained a seed and sites visited in phase 1 that were empty. A third experiment demonstrated that the motivational variables of reward size and deprivation were unlikely to account for the difference between the species. The results might indicate that there are differences in the spatial memory of the storing and non-storing species. but a difference …,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,111,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347205807857,300559871283515371,/scholar?cites=300559871283515371,,http://cognitioninthewild.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/files/2013/03/Krebs-et-al-AB-1990.pdf,0,0,0

We tested the hypothesis that birds defend smaller territories if they settle more or less at the same time. than if they settle on territories asynchronously. This idea is supported by some anecdotal field evidence in birds. To carry out the test. we did two types of removal experiments: (a) removing all the territory holders in an area at the same time and (b) removing territory holders one at a time. with 3- to 4-day intervals between each removal. Both types of removal were done in October 1972. coinciding with the fall peak of territorial activity. and in March 1973. coinciding with the spring peak. All the empty territories were rapidly refilled by juveniles that had previously been non-territorial; thus the breeding density of song sparrows is limited by territorial behavior.

Recent studies on food-storing birds suggest that. at a relatively late stage in their development. the specific memories associated with food-storing behaviour can stimulate growth of the hippocampus. an area of the brain concerned with memory processing.,True,UO1DLQoAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C,108,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0959438895800204,14196651678258272689,/scholar?cites=14196651678258272689,,,0,0,0

This gender difference suggests that the growth and progression of thyroid cancer may be influenced by female sex hormones. particularly estrogens. Experimental data have clearly demonstrated that estrogens can influence cancer cell growth. The action of estrogens on target sites is mediated through related but distinct estrogen receptors. designated estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). both of which are known to be expressed in thyroid cancer cells. The proliferation of thyroid cancer cells is promoted by an ERα agonist. whereas the proliferation is reduced by the enhanced expression of ERβ or by an ERβ agonist.

However. we propose that episodic prospection humans can vividly envisage exerts a strong and broad influence on individuals' delay discounting. Specifically. episodic prospection may affect individuals' intertemporal choice by the negative or positive emotion of prospection.  Methodology/Principal Findings The present study explored how episodic prospection modulated delay discounting by emotion. Study 1 showed that participants were more inclined to choose the delayed but larger rewards when they imaged positive future events than when they did not image events; Study 2 showed that participants were more inclined to choose the immediate but smaller rewards when they imaged negative future events than when they did not image events; In contrast. study 3 showed that choice preferences of participants when they imaged neutral future events were the same as when they did not image events.  Conclusions/Significance By manipulating the emotion valence of episodic prospection. our findings suggested that positive emotion made individuals tend to choose delayed rewards. while negative emotion made individuals tend to choose immediate rewards. Only imaging events with neutral emotion did not affect individuals' choice preference. Thus. the valence of imaged future events' emotion might play an important role in individuals' intertemporal choice.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) and its derived prostanoids. mainly including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2). have well-known roles in cardiovascular disease and cancer. both of which are associated with cigarette smoking. This article is focused on the role of COX-2 pathway in smoke-related pathologies and cancer. Cigarette smoke exposure can induce COX-2 expression and activity. increase PGE2 and TxA2 release. and lead to an imbalance in PGI2 and TxA2 production in favor of the latter. It exerts pro-inflammatory effects in a PGE2-dependent manner. which contributes to carcinogenesis and tumor progression.

However. its antitumor ability toward hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been studied. In this study. we demonstrated that DHA significantly inhibited HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo via inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The induction of p21 and the inhibition of cyclin B and CDC25C contributed to DHA-induced G2/M arrest. DHA-induced apoptosis was associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization. release of cytochrome c. activation of caspases. and DNA fragmentation. Activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. but not caspase 8. was detected in DHA-treated cells. Attenuation of apoptosis in cells pretreated with Z-VAD-FMK suggested the involvement of caspase cascade.

Hydrogen atoms are absorbed in bulk α-MoO3 to form the hydrogen molybdenum bronze HxMoO3 (x = 0.25. 0.5. 0.75. 1. 1.25. and 1.5). The semiconductor band gap of bulk α-MoO3 shifts to metallic upon hydrogen bronze formation at the H atom loadings selected in the present study. The hydrogen atoms become protonic when coordinated to oxygen. which gives rise to a charge reduction on the Mo atoms adjacent to the absorption sites. Hydrogen migration along a prescribed diffusion pathway in the lattice was found to be facile due to small energy barriers for H atom transfer between O atoms. facilitated by a hydrogen bonding network.

We aimed to study FOXP3 expression and regulation. function and clinical implication in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). One hundred and six patients with histologically-confirmed NSCLC who underwent surgery were recruited for the study. Tumor samples and NSCLC cell lines were used to examine FOXP3 and its related molecules. Various cell functions related to tumorigenesis were performed. In vivo mouse tumor xenograft was used to confirm the in vitro results. NSCLC patients with the high level of FOXP3 had a significant decrease in overall survival and recurrence-free survival. FOXP3 overexpression significantly induced cell proliferation. migration. and invasion. whereas its inhibition impaired its oncogenic function.

The size of the ring can be tuned in a facile manner by varying the concentration and solvent of the gel. as well as with a sonication stimulus. The gel responds to mechanical stimulus by the ring separating into a biased arc structure to expel the solvent molecules from the gel network. resulting in a gel to sol transition. The gel can self-heal again after resting and this process is reversible many times. Thus a reversible rheological switch upon alternate shaking and resting is performed via the distinct ring disintegration and reconstitution of the gel network.

The crossover arises from the interplay between cooperative grain sliding. grain rotations. and intergranular dislocation formation similar to stick-slip behavior.

We uncover a rich scenario of coexisting defect structures dictated by the unavoidable finite thickness of even the thinnest shell and by the thickness variation around the sphere. These structures are characterized by a varying number of disclination lines and pairs of surface point defects on the inner and outer surfaces of the nematic shell.

Metallic-glass structure factors are assumed to describe liquids in metastable equilibrium just above the glass transition. A density-functional mean-field theory is then used to search for nearby crystalline states with a lower free energy. We find that undercooled liquids are metastable with respect to an icosahedral crystal. similar to the recently discovered icosahedral phase of Al-Mn. Conventional bcc and fcc crystals have an even lower free energy. The icosahedral phase is favored by the short-range icosahedral order present in the liquid. There is. however. an energetic cost associated with long-wavelength fluctuations forced in by the incommensurability of the icosahedral density waves.

10102688,Vortex physics in high-temperature superconductors,1997,George W Crabtree and David R Nelson,50,Physics Today,4,38-45,,"The discovery of high-tem-perature superconductors1 has stimulated dramatic growth in our understanding of the physics of quantized vortex lines. These superconductors exclude magnetic fields weaker than a lower critical field Hcl< 10"" 2 tesla. Stronger fields penetrate as an array of vortices. each consisting of exactly one quantum of flux (<£ o= hc/2e) surrounded in the plane perpendicular to the field by circulating supercurrents that extend radially a few hundred nanometers. The behavior of vortices dominates many physical properties of high-temperature superconductors up to the upper critical field Hc2~ 102 tesla. where superconductivity gives way to normal metallic behavior and magnetic fields penetrate uniformly. Encompassing both fundamental science and commercial technology. the behavior of vortices promises to permanently alter the way we think about superconductivity and its potential applications. Of all the new physics generated by high-temperature superconductors. vortex behavior with its richness and complexity is perhaps the most unexpected and the most rapidly advancing. Vortices in superconductors provide a highly accessible example of flexible one-dimensional objects interacting through a simple potential in the presence of controlled disorder. These wandering lines of magnetic flux display complex equilibrium behavior reflecting liquid. crystalline and glassy phases. In addition. they can be subjected to an external driving force through the application of a transport current. allowing steady states of driven vortex motion to be established and explored.

Duality transformations relate the dislocation problem to Hamiltonians with short-ranged interactions amenable to a Migdal-Kadanoff recursion-relation analysis. In an approximation which neglects an angular dependence in the decay of correlations. the melting problem is equivalent to the statistical mechanics of two interpenetrating superfluids with coupled phases. The coupling between the phases is a marginal operator which (together with other marginal couplings) destroys the universality of critical exponents at the melting temperature T m. Indeed melting seems to bear roughly the same relation to the planar model as the Baxter model does to the Ising model.

To survive this process. pollen grains possess a variety of physiological and structural adaptations. Perhaps the most striking of these adaptations is the ability of the pollen wall to fold onto itself to prevent further desiccation. Roger P. Wodehouse coined the term harmomegathy for this folding process in recognition of the critical role it plays in the survival of the pollen grain. There is still. however. no quantitative theory that explains how the structure of the pollen wall contributes to harmomegathy. Here we demonstrate that simple geometrical and mechanical principles explain how wall structure guides pollen grains toward distinct folding pathways.

In contrast to bulk mixtures. the line of superfluid transitions is connected to the phase-separation curve by a critical end point. The universal jump of the superfluid density. present in the pure He 4 system. is preserved with increasing He 3 concentrations x until the critical end point occurs at x≲ 0.12. At smaller x. phase separation causes a kink in the superfluid density versus temperature curve. No tricritical point occurs for any value of the model parameters. although an effectively tricritical phase diagram is obtained in a certain limit.

In this paper we investigate the structural features and the equilibrium dynamics of micrometre-scale spherical crystals formed by polystyrene particles adsorbed on the surface of a spherical water droplet. The ground state of sufficiently large crystals possesses finite-length grain boundaries (scars). We determine the elastic response of the crystal by measuring single-particle diffusion. and quantify the fluctuations of individual dislocations about their equilibrium positions within a scar by determining the dislocation spring constants. We observe rapid dislocation glide with fluctuations over the barriers separating one local Peierls minimum from the next and rather weak binding of dislocations to their associated scars.

For an appropriate size ratio. we find a dilute phase without translational order. but with very-long-range correlations in the orientations of local hexagonal axes. The phase appears to be a quenched analogue of the equilibrium hexatic phase. which appears in two-dimensional melting theories. The peculiar properties of this hexatic glass are attributed to the tendency of a dilute array of large spheres imbedded in a medium of smaller spheres to trap dislocations. Significant orientational correlations also appear in more concentrated mixtures. giving rise to a six-fold modulation of the structure function in large. but finite. samples.,True,jGboazkAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,156,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01418618208236211,17635617462925819792,/scholar?cites=17635617462925819792,,,0,0,0

Spatial structure can promote cooperation. but spatial expansions may also make it hard for mutualistic partners to stay together. because genetic drift at the expansion front creates regions of low genetic and species diversity. To explore the antagonism between mutualism and genetic drift. we grew cross-feeding strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on agar surfaces as a model for mutualists undergoing spatial expansions. By supplying varying amounts of the exchanged nutrients. we tuned strength and symmetry of the mutualistic interaction. Strong mutualism suppresses genetic demixing during spatial expansions and thereby maintains diversity. but weak or asymmetric mutualism is overwhelmed by genetic drift even when mutualism is still beneficial. slowing growth and reducing diversity.

Similar order can arise in low-temperature He 4 films with a highly anisotropic periodic substrate potential. If the smectic order is commensurate with the layering. this periodic array is stable to quenched random pointlike disorder. By tilting and adjusting the magnitude of the applied field. both incommensurate and tilted smectic and crystalline phases are found for vortex arrays. Related variations are possible by changing the chemical potential in the helium system.

Such systems can be mapped onto a Coulomb gas with a quenched random array of dipoles. For large amounts of randomness. the low-temperature phase of the XY model is destroyed entirely. For small amounts of randomness. the behavior with decreasing temperatures is first paramagnetic. then ferromagnetic. and finally becomes paramagnetic again via a second. reentrant phase transition. These phase transitions are driven by an unbinding of vortices. just as in pure XY models. In contrast to pure XY models. the exponent η and the spin-wave stiffness are nonuniversal at T c. The reentrant phase transitions appear to persist when the model is continued to 2+ ε dimensions.

These experiments. however. are often limited to the well-mixed environments of a test tube or a chemostat. Since spatial organization can significantly affect evolutionary dynamics. the need is growing for evolutionary experiments in spatially structured environments. The surface of a Petri dish provides such an environment. but a more detailed understanding of microbial growth on Petri dishes is necessary to interpret such experiments. We formulate a simple deterministic reaction–diffusion model. which successfully predicts the spatial patterns created by two competing species during colony expansion.

We argue that the entropy associated with line wandering nevertheless can cause these defects to proliferate at a sharp transition which will exist if this occurs below the temperature at which the crystal actually melts. Vortices are both entangled and crystalline in the resulting ‘‘supersolid’’phase. which in a dual ‘‘boson’’-analog system is closely related to a two-dimensional quantum crystal of He 4 with interstitials or vacancies in its ground state.

We find that the EGFR kinase domain can be activated by increasing its local concentration or by mutating a leucine (L834R) in the activation loop. the phosphorylation of which is not required for activation. This suggests that the kinase domain is intrinsically autoinhibited. and an intermolecular interaction promotes its activation. Using further mutational analysis and crystallography we demonstrate that the autoinhibited conformation of the EGFR kinase domain resembles that of Src and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). EGFR activation results from the formation of an asymmetric dimer in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase domain plays a role analogous to that of cyclin in activated CDK/cyclin complexes.

We have studied the molecular mechanism of receptor activation using a homogeneously tetraphosphorylated form of TβR-I. prepared using protein semisynthesis. Phosphorylation of the GS region dramatically enhances the specificity of TβR-I for the critical C-terminal serines of Smad2. In addition. tetraphosphorylated TβR-I is bound specifically by Smad2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and is no longer recognized by the inhibitory protein FKBP12.

It follows that colocalization can amplify the effect on one protein of random mutations in another protein and can therefore. through natural selection. lead to interactions between proteins and to a startling variety of complex allosteric controls.

The recognition of an inactive conformation of Abl. in which a catalytically important Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif is flipped by approximately 180° with respect to the active conformation. underlies the specificity of the cancer drug imatinib. which is used to treat CML. The DFG motif is not flipped in crystal structures of inactive forms of the closely related Src kinases. and imatinib does not inhibit c-Src. We present a structure of the kinase domain of Abl. determined in complex with an ATP–peptide conjugate. in which the protein adopts an inactive conformation that resembles closely that of the Src kinases. An interesting aspect of the Src-like inactive structure. suggested by molecular dynamics simulations and additional crystal structures. is the presence of features that might facilitate the flip of the DFG motif by providing room for the phenylalanine to move and by coordinating the aspartate side chain as it leaves the active site. One class of mutations in BCR–Abl that confers resistance to imatinib appears more likely to destabilize the inactive Src-like conformation than the active or imatinib-bound conformations.

On heatingfrom 80 to 300 K. the volumeoccupied by myoglobin increases by approximately 3%. The linear thermal expansion coefficient is estimated to be 115 X 10-6 K_1. This value is more than twice as large as that of liquid water but less than that of benzene. As the temperature is raised. the internal volumechange does not come from the large. atom-sized internal cavities in the structure butfrom an increase in the small. subatomic free volumesbetween atoms. The largest expansion occurs in the region of the CD and GH corners; both these regions move away from the center of the protein. The remainder of the expansion results from the lengthening of contacts between segments of secondary structure.,True,zAN_HyYAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC,249,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi00375a035,7579047758668458217,/scholar?cites=7579047758668458217,,,0,0,0

The assembly of most ubiquitin chains is promoted by E2s. yet how these enzymes achieve linkage specificity is poorly understood.

The E2-donor ubiquitin complex transiently recognizes the acceptor ubiquitin. primarily through electrostatic interactions. The recognition of the acceptor ubiquitin surface around Lys11. but not around other lysines. generates a catalytically competent active site. which is composed of residues of both Ube2S and ubiquitin.

SOS has two binding sites for Ras. one of which is an allosteric site that is distal to the active site. The activity of the SOS catalytic unit (SOS cat) is up to 500-fold higher when Ras is on membranes compared to rates in solution. because the allosteric Ras site anchors SOS cat to the membrane. This effect is blocked by the N-terminal segment of SOS. which occludes the allosteric site.

Clamp binding to template ssDNA may also serve to hold the clamp at a primed site after loading or during switching of multiple factors on the clamp.

Although imatinib binds tightly to the Abl kinase domain. its affinity for the closely related kinase domain of c-Src is at least 2.000-fold lower. Imatinib recognition requires a specific inactive conformation of the kinase domain. in which a conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif is flipped with respect to the active conformation. The inability of c-Src to readily adopt this flipped DFG conformation was thought to underlie the selectivity of imatinib for Abl over c-Src.

A stringent assay for replication-competent virus showed that no helper virus was present. The system can produce high titers of retroviral vectors expressing genes that are extremely difficult to propagate at high titer in stable producer lines.

The subunits preferentially form a heterodimer that activates transcription. Although p50 and p65 bind DNA individually as homodimers and are structurally related. their activation mechanisms are distinct. p65 activates transcription by its unique carboxy-terminal activation domain. (p50)2 displays higher affinity DNA binding than (p65)2 for many distinct kappa B motifs and provides strong transcriptional activation only when adopting a chymotrypsin-resistant conformation induced by certain kappa B motifs but not others. Thus. (p50)2 acts as a positive regulator in vitro. consistent with its isolation as a putative constitutive regulator of MHC class I genes.

Overproduced I kappa B. free from NF-kappa B. is rapidly degraded. Overexpression of p65 increases endogenous I kappa B protein in both carcinoma and lymphoid cells by two mechanisms: protein stabilization and increased transcription of I kappa B mRNA. In contrast. p65 delta. a naturally occurring splice variant. fails to markedly augment I kappa B protein levels. Both overexpressed p65 and coexpressed p50 are cytoplasmic. whereas p65 delta is partly nuclear. indicating that the I kappa B induced by p65 can maintain NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm.

Using retroviral cDNA library–based functional cloning we identified a gene toso. that blocks Fas-mediated apoptosis. Toso expression was confined to lymphoid cells and was enhanced after cell-specific activation processes in T cells. Toso appeared limited to inhibition of apoptosis mediated by members of the TNF receptor family and was capable of inhibiting T cell self-killing induced by TCR activation processes that up-regulate Fas ligand. We mapped the effect of Toso to inhibition of caspase-8 processing. the most upstream caspase activity in Fas-mediated signaling. potentially through activation of cFLIP.

Activation of unknown host intracellular events overcomes such inhibitory steps and is concomitant with HIV-1 replication. We show that the transcription factor NFATc was sufficient as a cellular factor to induce a highly permissive state for HIV-1 replication in primary CD4+ T cells. NFATc overcame a blockade at reverse transcription and permitted active HIV-1 replication. Pharmacologic blockade of endogenous NFAT activity by FK506 or CsA inhibited synthesis of reverse transcription and also potently blocked HIV-1 replication.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In fluorescence‐based flow cytometry. cellular viability is determined with membrane‐impermeable fluorescent reagents that specifically enter and label plasma membrane‐compromised nonviable cells. A recent technological advance in flow cytometry uses antibodies conjugated to elemental metal isotopes. rather than to fluorophores. to allow signal detection by atomic mass spectrometry. Unhampered by the limitations of overlapping emission fluorescence. mass cytometry increases the number of parameters that can be measured in single cells. However. mass cytometry is unable to take advantage of current fluorescent viability dyes. An alternative methodology was therefore developed here in which the platinum‐containing chemotherapy drug cisplatin was used to resolve live and dead cells by mass cytometry.

It is thought that IDH1 mutants act by inhibiting TET2 to alter DNA methylation. but there are significant unexplained clinical differences between IDH1- and TET2-mutant diseases. We have discovered that mice expressing endogenous mutant IDH1 have reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). in contrast to Tet2 knockout (TET2-KO) mice. Mutant IDH1 downregulates the DNA damage (DD) sensor ATM by altering histone methylation. leading to impaired DNA repair. increased sensitivity to DD. and reduced HSC self-renewal. independent of TET2. ATM expression is also decreased in human IDH1-mutated AML.

To discover broad relationships between regulation of alternative splicing and sequence conservation. we applied a systems approach. using oligonucleotide microarrays designed to capture splicing information across the mouse genome. In a set of 22 adult tissues. we observe differential expression of RNA containing at least two alternative splice junctions for about 40% of the 6.216 alternative events we could detect. Statistical comparisons identify 171 cassette exons whose inclusion or skipping is different in brain relative to other tissues and another 28 exons whose splicing is different in muscle. A subset of these exons is associated with unusual blocks of intron sequence whose conservation in vertebrates rivals that of protein-coding exons. By focusing on sets of exons with similar regulatory patterns. we have identified new sequence motifs implicated in brain and muscle splicing regulation. Of note is a motif that is strikingly similar to the branchpoint consensus but is located downstream of the 5′ splice site of exons included in muscle. Analysis of three paralogous membrane-associated guanylate kinase genes reveals that each contains a paralogous tissue-regulated exon with a similar tissue inclusion pattern. While the intron sequences flanking these exons remain highly conserved among mammalian orthologs. the paralogous flanking intron sequences have diverged considerably. suggesting unusually complex evolution of the regulation of alternative splicing in multigene families.,True,BUnlF_IAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,229,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020004,9021464422927551677,/scholar?cites=9021464422927551677,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020004,0,0,0

When the phenotype is gene expression. then loci involved in regulatory control can theoretically be implicated. Recent efforts to construct gene regulatory networks from genotype and gene expression data have shown that biologically relevant networks can be achieved from an integrative approach. In this paper. we consider the problem of identifying individual pairs of genes in a direct or indirect. causal. trans-acting relationship. Inspired by epistatic models of multi-locus quantitative trait (QTL) mapping. we propose a unified model of expression and genotype to identify quantitative trait genes (QTG) by extending the conventional linear model to include both genotype and expression of regulator genes and their interactions.

SNP detection. and expression analysis. among other applications. Such broad capabilities would be of value to many pathogen research communities. although the development and use of genome-scale microarrays is often a costly undertaking. Therefore. effective methods for reducing unnecessary probes while maintaining or expanding functionality would be relevant to many investigators. Taking advantage of available genome sequences and annotation for Toxoplasma gondii (a pathogenic parasite responsible for illness in immunocompromised individuals) and Plasmodium falciparum (a related parasite responsible for severe human malaria). we designed a single oligonucleotide microarray capable of supporting a wide range of applications at relatively low cost. including genome-wide expression profiling for Toxoplasma. and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genotyping of both T. gondii and P. falciparum. Expression profiling of the three clonotypic lineages dominating T. gondii populations in North America and Europe provides a first comprehensive view of the parasite transcriptome. revealing that ~49% of all annotated genes are expressed in parasite tachyzoites (the acutely lytic stage responsible for pathogenesis) and 26% of genes are differentially expressed among strains.

A generalized hidden Markov model (GHMM) describes the grammar of a legal parse of a DNA sequence. Probabilities are estimated for gene features by using dynamic programming to combine information from multiple sensors. We show how matches to homologous sequences from a database can be integrated into the probability estimation by interpreting the likelihood of a sequence in terms of the bit-cost to encode a sequence given a homology match. We also demonstrate how homology matches in protein databases can be exploited to help identify splice sites.

Reasonable performance on this task has been achieved using generatively trained sequence models. such as hidden Markov models. We propose instead the use of a discriminitively trained sequence model. the conditional random field (CRF). CRFs can naturally incorporate arbitrary. non-independent features of the input without making conditional independence assumptions among the features. This can be particularly important for gene finding. where including evidence from protein databases. EST data. or tiling arrays may improve accuracy.

It operates by replacing a substring of a text with a pointer to its longest previous occurrence in the input. for each coding step. Decoding a compressed file is very fast. but encoding involves searching at each coding step to find the longest match for the next few characters. This paper presents eight data structures that can be used to accelerate the searching. including adaptations of four methods normally used for exact matching searching. The algorithms are evaluated analytically and empirically. indicating the trade‐offs available between compression speed and memory consumption.

Previously. the Genie gene-finding algorithm was trained on a small set of Chlamydomonas genes and shown to improve the accuracy of gene prediction in this species compared to other available programs. To improve ab initio gene finding in Chlamydomonas. we assemble a new training set consisting of over 2.300 cDNAs by assembling over 167.000 Chlamydomonas EST entries in GenBank using the EST assembly tool PASA.

A key characteristic of the method model topology. A computer program called"" Genie"" embodies the method described here. Employing mostly standard metrics for feature scoring. the basic gene-prediction method is shown to work better than other known …",True,BUnlF_IAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,10,https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=5457814,4325276999700059797,/scholar?cites=4325276999700059797,,,0,0,0

Here we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile RNA expression in 188.776 individual interneurons across homologous brain regions from three primates (human. macaque and marmoset). a rodent (mouse) and a weasel (ferret). Homologous interneuron types—which were readily identified by their RNA-expression patterns—varied in abundance and RNA expression among ferrets. mice and primates. but varied less among primates. Only a modest fraction of the genes identified as ‘markers’ of specific interneuron subtypes in any one species had this property in another species. In the primate neocortex. dozens of genes showed spatial expression gradients among interneurons of the same …,True,BUnlF_IAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,8,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2781-z,15103048494177056387,/scholar?cites=15103048494177056387,,,0,0,0
10102969,Dirichlet mixtures for query estimation in information retrieval,2005,Mark D Smucker and David Kulp and James Allan,,Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval,,,,Treated as small samples of text. user queries require smoothing to better estimate the probabilities of their true model. Traditional techniques to perform this smoothing include automatic query expansion and local feedback. This paper applies the bioinformatics smoothing technique. Dirichlet mixtures. to the task of query estimation. We discuss Dirichlet mixtures’ relation to relevance models. probabilistic latent semantic indexing. and other information retrieval techniques. We describe how Dirichlet mixtures give insight into the value of retaining the original query in query expansion. On the task of adhoc retrieval. query estimation by Dirichlet mixtures generally does not perform well. but aspects of its behavior show promise. Experiments where the original query is mixed with the models estimated by relevance models and Dirichlet mixtures confirms that query estimation methods should not fully discount the prior information held in a query.,True,BUnlF_IAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,6,http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/pubfiles/ir-445.pdf,8091410663610292466,/scholar?cites=8091410663610292466,,http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/pubfiles/ir-445.pdf,0,0,0
