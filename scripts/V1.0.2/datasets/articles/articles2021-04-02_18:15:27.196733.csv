1300300,Comparison of integrated clustering methods for accurate and stable prediction of building energy consumption data,2015,David Hsu,160,Applied Energy,,153-163,Elsevier,Clustering methods are often used to model energy consumption for two reasons. First. clustering is often used to process data and to improve the predictive accuracy of subsequent energy models. Second. stable clusters that are reproducible with respect to non-essential changes can be used to group. target. and interpret observed subjects. However. it is well known that clustering methods are highly sensitive to the choice of algorithms and variables. This can lead to misleading assessments of predictive accuracy and mis-interpretation of clusters in policymaking.This paper therefore introduces two methods to the modeling of energy consumption in buildings: clusterwise regression. also known as latent class regression. which integrates clustering and regression simultaneously; and cluster validation methods to measure stability. Using a large dataset of multifamily buildings in New York City. clusterwise …,True,bZ98GoIAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,118,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261915010624,3364963657817466761,/scholar?cites=3364963657817466761,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261915010624,0,0,0
1300301,How much information disclosure of building energy performance is necessary?,2014,David Hsu,64,Energy Policy,,263-272,Elsevier,Many different governments have begun to require disclosure of building energy performance. in order to allow owners and prospective buyers to incorporate this information into their investment decisions. These policies. known as disclosure or information policies. require owners to benchmark their buildings and sometimes conduct engineering audits. However. given substantial variation in the cost to disclose different types of information. it is natural to ask: how much and what kind of information about building energy performance should be disclosed. and for what purposes? To answer this question. this paper assembles and cleans a comprehensive panel dataset of New York City multifamily buildings. and analyzes its predictive power using a Bayesian multilevel regression model.

1300302,Identifying key variables and interactions in statistical models of building energy consumption using regularization,2015,David Hsu,83,Energy,,144-155,Elsevier,Statistical models can only be as good as the data put into them. Data about energy consumption continues to grow. particularly its non-technical aspects. but these variables are often interpreted differently among disciplines. datasets. and contexts. Selecting key variables and interactions is therefore an important step in achieving more accurate predictions. better interpretation. and identification of key subgroups for further analysis.This paper therefore makes two main contributions to the modeling and analysis of energy consumption of buildings. First. it introduces regularization. also known as penalized regression. for principled selection of variables and interactions. Second. this approach is demonstrated by application to a comprehensive dataset of energy consumption for commercial office and multifamily buildings in New York City.

1300303,Improving energy benchmarking with self-reported data,2014,David Hsu,42,Building Research & Information,5,641-656,Taylor & Francis,Energy benchmarking for buildings has become increasingly important in government policy and industry practice for energy efficiency. The questions of how energy benchmarking is currently conducted. and how it might be improved using rapidly growing quantities of self-reported data. are examined. A case study of commercial office buildings in New York City demonstrates how the rapid growth in self-reported data presents both new opportunities and challenges for energy benchmarking for buildings. A critique is presented for the scoring methodology and data sources for Energy Star. one of the largest and most successful benchmarking certification schemes. Findings from recent studies are examined to illustrate how this certification currently works in the marketplace.

By requiring owners to measure and disclose their energy use. these policies are intended to transform the market for energy-efficient investments in existing buildings. To improve future policy efforts. two critical questions are: first. how much energy do these policies save? and second. what particular aspects of these policies are most effective? To answer these questions. this study explores how different aspects of these policies were phased-in to different groups of buildings over the first four years of the City of New York's benchmarking ordinance. By applying a novel difference-in-differences strategy. we can causally attribute observed declines in energy consumption to specific owner behaviors and policy mechanisms.

Since water systems in the United States are largely run by public sector agencies. this study conducted a national survey with officials in water utilities and agencies to understand what kinds and capabilities of smart green infrastructure are desired for stormwater management. Analyzing the stated preferences of these users using a discrete choice model. our results indicate that these officials are willing to invest more upfront in smart technologies if they lower the costs associated over time with construction. maintenance. and labor.

1300309,Characterizing energy use in New York City commercial and multifamily buildings,2012,David Hsu,,,,,,Many cities have recently developed and passed benchmarking laws (also known as energy disclosure. information. or transparency laws) to make energy information available for individual buildings. This building-level micro-data can be used to better design and develop municipal policies for energy efficiency.Based on benchmarking data collected by the City of New York. this paper presents a comprehensive portrait of energy use in New York City commercial and multifamily buildings. including the distribution and concentration of energy uses and building types within the overall population. First. this paper describes energy and building characteristics for the overall population of over 10.000 buildings. comprising over 1.5 billion square feet. Second. using model-based clustering methods. this paper then identifies key clusters of energy use and building characteristics in the multifamily sector. The paper finds that these clustering methods describe sub-groups in the population in intuitive ways. Third. using multivariate regression. the identified clusters are then used to improve predictions of building energy use and the targeting of prospective efficiency efforts.

Azole resistance is an emerging clinical problem in patients with Aspergillus infections. primarily those caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. Alanio et al. 1 describe the results of a study that investigated the prevalence of azole resistance in 118 clinical Aspergillus isolates obtained from a cohort of 89 patients with haematological malignancy. They found only one azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolate. which corresponded to a prevalence of 0.85%. 1 Although the low prevalence of resistance may be reassuring. the circumstances surrounding the resistant isolate are a cause of great concern.

Croatia,Salmonellae are Gram-negative facultative anaerobes that have been divided into two species: S. enterica. which is subdivided into over 2.500 serovars. and Salmonella bongori. Some serovars of S. enterica. such as S. Typhi. cause systemic infections and typhoid fever. whereas others. such as S. Typhimurium. cause gastroenteritis. Nontyphoidal Salmonella are a major cause of food poisoning being Salmonellosis one of the most common and widely distributed foodborne diseases. Millions of human cases are reported worldwide every year and the disease constitutes a major public health burden. causing significant morbidity and mortality in several countries. Since the beginning of the 1990s. strains of Salmonella which are resistant to a range of antimicrobials. including first-choice agents for human treatment. have emerged and are threatening to become a serious public health problem. Multidrug-resistant strains of Salmonella are now frequently encountered and the rates of multidrug-resistance (MDR) have been increasing considerably in recent years [World Health Organization (WHO. 2005)].Strains of Salmonella spp. with resistance to antimicrobial drugs are now widespread in both developed and developing countries. Effective antimicrobial agents are essential for human and animal health and welfare. However. infections caused by resistant microorganisms often fail to respond to standard treatment. resulting in prolonged illness and greater risk of death. Hence. the increasing antimicrobial resistance is considered a public health problem at a global level (Musgrove et al.. 2006; Võ. 2007).

1300341,The accuracy and efficiency of GA and PSO optimization schemes on estimating reaction kinetic parameters of biomass pyrolysis,2019,Yanming Ding and Wenlong Zhang and Lei Yu and Kaihua Lu,176,Energy,,582-588,Pergamon,Reaction kinetic parameters estimation of biomass pyrolysis is a relatively difficult optimization problem due to the complexity of pyrolysis model. Two common heuristic algorithms. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). are applied to estimate the kinetic parameters of three-component parallel reaction mechanism based on the thermogravimetric experiment in wide heating rates. The accuracy and efficiency of GA and PSO algorithms are compared with each other under the identical optimization conditions.

The firing heat input and the resulting barrel temperature rise depend on the thermal properties of the barrel material. In particular. they depend on the thermal conductivity. specific heat. and mass density. Since conductivity and specific heat depend on barrel temperature. gun barrel heating becomes a nonlinear problem. If the temperature range is large. this temperature dependence can have an effect on the predicted barrel temperature change. We shall show how these effects are modeled by use of a finite difference solution to the one-dimensional Fourier equation of heat conduction.

Structurally. these small variations will not appreciably diminish the strength of the barrel. and are. therefore. riot a firing safety concern. However. even small variations will produce cross-barrel temperature differences that can increase with the number of rounds fired. and thereby produce thermal distortion of the barrel. which degrades gun accuracy. This investigation presents a theoretical finite difference analysis of the cross-barrel temperature difference expected to occur as a result of typical and atypical wall thickness variation in production-line guns. The results indicate that typical barrels will riot incur an appreciable thermal bend due to wall thickness variation.

Ambient temperature kinetic assessment of biogas production from co-digestion of horse and cow dung. Res. Agr. Eng.. 57: 97–104.Biogas production from 5 batch digesters containing varying ratio of mix of horse and cow dung was studied for a period of 30 days at ambient temperature. It was observed that biogas production was optimized when horse and cow dung were mixed in a ratio of 3: 1. The modified Gompertz equation was used to adequately describe the cumulative biogas production from these digesters. In addition. a modified first order model was developed to assess the kinetics of the biodegradation process. It was observed that the rates of substrate biodegradability and of removal of the biodegradable fractions of the substrate could be obtained by plotting 1/t (ln (dyt/dt)) against the inverse of time of digestion. This modified first order model also showed that the digester containing horse dung and cow dung in the ratio of 3: 1 had the highest short term anaerobic biodegradability index (STABI) of 3.96 at room temperature.,True,SNxiu08AAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC,117,https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/25_2010-RAE.pdf,10878442463545391146,/scholar?cites=10878442463545391146,,,https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/25_2010-RAE.pdf,0,0,0

The loss of pipe wall thickness due to corrosion inevitably leads to a reduction in the pipeline’s strength and ability to sustain a design pressure. If corrosion defects are closely spaced. the corrosion feature may interact. resulting in failure pressure lower than would be expected if the defects were evaluated as separate flaws. In such a situation. industry methods for remaining strength calculation have been shown to be conservative. This present work presents a new model that improves the current methodologies for estimating the remaining strength of a corroded pipeline with interacting defects. utilizing a finite element analysis approach in combination with curve fitting. The new model demonstrates the potentials of improved estimation of the remaining strength over the existing industry models. The implication is that the presented model has the potentials of reducing the conservatism inherent in the existing models for estimating the remaining strength of oil and gas pipelines.,True,SNxiu08AAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC,5,https://www.cogentoa.com/article/10.1080/23311916.2019.1663682,6379173377812019486,/scholar?cites=6379173377812019486,,,https://www.cogentoa.com/article/10.1080/23311916.2019.1663682,0,0,0

The resource assessments show that the solar insolation. wind speed (at 30 m hub height) and biomass in the country range. respectively. from 4.38–6.00 kWh/m 2/day. 3.74 to 11.04 m/s and 5.709–15.80 kg/household/day. The HOMER software was used to obtain optimal configurations of the eight hybrid energy systems along the six geopolitical zones’ RE resources. The eight optimal systems were further subjected to a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis. which considers technical. economic. environmental and socio-cultural criteria. The TOPSIS-AHP composite procedure was adopted for the MCDM analysis in order to have more realistic criteria weighting factors. In all the eight techno-economic optimal system configurations considered. the biomass generator-solar PV-battery energy system (GPBES) was the best system for all the geopolitical zones. The best system has the potential of capturing carbon from the atmosphere. an attribute that is desirous for climate change mitigation. The cost of energy (COE) was seen to be within the range of 0.151–0.156 US $/kWh. which is competitive with the existing electricity cost from the national grid. average 0.131 US $/kWh. It is shown that the Federal Government of Nigeria favorable energy policy towards the adoption of biomass-to-electricity systems would make the proposed system very affordable to the rural households.,True,SNxiu08AAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC,3,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5732,13707073192815739166,/scholar?cites=13707073192815739166,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5732/pdf,0,0,0

1300413,Analytical Criterion for Droplet Breakup in Turbulent Flow Fields,2014,EO Diemuodeke and I Sher,,,,,,The utilisation of high-injection-pressure fuel system in direct diesel injection requires liquid fuel being injected at a very high pressure. which is later converted to a corresponding high velocity by the injector nozzle. which gives rise to a turbulent flow fields around droplets. The fate of a droplet that travels through ambient depends on the droplet velocity. on the droplet thermo-physical properties and on the ambient properties. which are related. in part. by the Weber number. The Weber number is the ratio between disruptive forces and cohesive forces. When a drop travels in ambient. deformation occurs. which may lead to droplet breakup. The droplet breakup will occur only if the Weber number locally exceeds a certain critical value. A new droplet breakup criterion model. which combines energy criterion and dual-timescale. to also account for turbulent shear in droplet dispersion. is suggested for droplet breakup. The suggested analytical breakup criterion is proposed on the basis of the critical Weber number. The analytical breakup criterion is in good agreement with published experimental data. The present analytical criterion for droplet breakup successfully predicts the breakup limit–for the very low and high We-Oh conditions.

The spatial variation of surface tension is obtained through temperature-dependent surface tension and transient heat-transfer from the combusting gases to the liquid jet.

1300436,Energy from the Earth: Deep Geothermal as a Resource for the Future?,2014,Stefan Hirschberg and Stefan Wiemer and Peter Burgherr,62,,,,vdf Hochschulverlag AG,Switzerland's Energy Strategy 2050 requires energy efficiency to be substantially improved. the proportion of fossil fuels in the energy supply to be considerably reduced. and nuclear power to be phased out. while meeting highly ambitious climate protection targets. One of the core implications is the need for a massive increase of the use of renewable sources for electricity generation. In this context. the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) estimates that by 2050 deep geothermal energy could contribute 4–5 TWh per year to electricity generation in Switzerland. which would be a substantial contribution to a projected annual power need of 60 TWh. Geothermal energy is attractive because of the very large scale of the resource. its expected relatively low CO2 emissions. and its reliable. all-day domestic availability. However. the future contribution of deep geothermal energy is subject to major uncertainties: How much of this resource can be exploited and at what economic cost? What are the environmental and risk-related externalities that the public must be willing to bear? How does its overall performance compare to competing energy resources? And will the regulatory framework and public acceptance be sufficient to allow geothermal energy to provide a significant contribution?

1300449,Comprehensive Thermodynamic Analysis of the Humphrey Cycle for Gas Turbines with Pressure Gain Combustion,2018,P. Stathopoulos,11,Energies,12,,MDPI,Conventional gas turbines are approaching their efficiency limits and performance gains are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve. Pressure Gain Combustion (PGC) has emerged as a very promising technology in this respect. due to the higher thermal efficiency of the respective ideal gas turbine thermodynamic cycles. Up to date. only very simplified models of open cycle gas turbines with pressure gain combustion have been considered. However. the integration of a fundamentally different combustion technology will be inherently connected with additional losses. Entropy generation in the combustion process. combustor inlet pressure loss (a central issue for pressure gain combustors). and the impact of PGC on the secondary air system (especially blade cooling) are all very important parameters that have been neglected. The current work uses the Humphrey cycle in an attempt to address all these issues in order to provide gas turbine component designers with benchmark efficiency values for individual components of gas turbines with PGC. The analysis concludes with some recommendations for the best strategy to integrate turbine expanders with PGC combustors. This is done from a purely thermodynamic point of view. again with the goal to deliver design benchmark values for a more realistic interpretation of the cycle.

The reason is the considerably higher thermal efficiency of theses cycles. at least for their ideal versions. Shockless explosion combustion is a method to approximate constant volume combustion. It is a cyclic process that consists of four stages. namely wave propagation. fuel injection. homogeneous auto-ignition and exhaust. A pressure wave in the combustion chamber is used to realize the filling and exhaust phases. During the fuel injection stage. the equivalence ratio is controlled in such a way that the ignition delay time of the mixture matches its residence time in the chamber before self ignition.

Steam injection effectively inhibits NOx formation and makes gas turbine operation on hydrogenrich fuels and almost stoichiometric mixtures feasible. In the present paper. the potential of ultra-wet gas turbine cycles is assessed in terms of efficiency increase and emission reduction.The first part of the paper presents a comparison of wet cycles to their dry alternatives for typical. industrial gas turbines. The ability of wet cycles to facilitate operation on almost stoichiometric mixtures is underlined and the effects of this operation on the efficiency and the power density of the cycles are analyzed. In the second part of the paper. the influence of steamdilution on the emissions formation under atmospheric and elevated pressures is experimentally investigated. The results show that the addition of 20%(related to the inlet air mass flow rate) of steam ensured NOx levels below 10 ppm up to near stoichiometric conditions without detrimental effects on the CO burnout. The reduction in NOx emissions. even at a constant flame temperature. is mainly caused by lower concentrations of atomic oxygen at steam-diluted conditions. constraining the thermal pathway.

Which generation technologies are financially viable? And which generation technologies are affordable? Our analysis addresses these for Kenya and Ghana by calculating the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) and internal rate of return (IRR) for a portfolio of renewable energy (RE) technologies under different scenarios. Our results show better fundamentals in Kenya for the successful implementation of renewable energy projects. Wind and geothermal technology offer low-cost electricity and healthy returns on investment. Solar photovoltaics (PV) could be competitive with expensive diesel generation but its current price does not allow for cost recovery. Kenyan feed-in tariffs (FiTs) protect investors against currency devaluation and the off-taker is creditworthy. Ghana’s renewable electricity (except hydro) is expensive in comparison and offers lower returns. This is mainly due to high financing costs and lower-quality RE resources. Additionally. RE investors in Ghana are not protected against further currency devaluation by the existing FiT scheme and there are concerns about the creditworthiness of the off-taker.

1300473,Pro-poor access to green electricity in Kenya,2015,Ana Pueyo,,,IDS Evidence Report; 135,,IDS,Is Kenya on track to follow an electrification strategy that is green and pro-poor? What are the main challenges to following this path? The two questions guiding this study are particularly relevant in a country with exceptional renewable energy resources. but where 80 per cent of the population lacks access to electricity and 50 per cent lives in poverty. This study looks at four particular issues relating to access to green electricity for the poor: accessibility; commercial viability for project developers; financial sustainability for the State; and affordability. We will focus on grid electricity and mini-grids. For grid-connected generation. once electricity is fed to the grid. the issues of accessibility and affordability for the poor depend on national policies determining who gets electricity and at what price. making it impossible to differentiate between green and non-green electricity. However. our study will show whether or not on-grid renewable generation can be financially sustainable in Kenya while providing affordable fees. For off-grid electricity. targeting the poor is a matter of situating generation capacity in the right places and affordability is a matter of setting prices that allow for cost recovery without being excessively expensive for the poor. This report can support decision-making for development and climate finance institutions. as well as private investors in Kenya seeking a pro-poor green electrification strategy. It shows how to target the poor. which electrification alternatives to use. at what price. whether or not this is commercially viable and which policies would be required to make it so.,True,q9B7udQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,14,https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/20.500.12413/6165,2924339819153671173,/scholar?cites=2924339819153671173,,,https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/6165/ER135_ProPoorAccesstoGreenElectricityinKenya.pdf;sequence=1,0,0,0

Existing literature also shows that lack of control over monthly bills and unawareness of consumption levels lead to inefficient and sometimes insufficient electricity consumption patterns by the poor.  Innovative technologies drawing from existing power metering and mobile payment technologies are now targeting the barriers of affordability and financial sustainability of electricity provision to the poor by allowing fee-for-services and rent-to-buy schemes for the sale of electricity. tariffs related to actual consumption. consumers’ control of their electricity bills and suppliers’ more efficient collection of payments.

1300476,Green growth diagnostics for Africa: Literature review and scoping study,2015,Ana Pueyo and Stephen Spratt and Hubert Schmitz and Dirk Willenbockel and Chris Dent and Neal Wade and Andrew Crossland,,,,,Institute of Development Studies,This paper reviews the literature for a project which seeks to develop a new Green Growth Diagnostics methodology and apply it to countries in Africa.  The original growth diagnostics methodology was developed by Haussmann. Rodrik and Velasco to identify the key constraints holding back economic growth from its full potential. Their approach was driven by the needs of policymakers facing the dilemma that most problems have multiple causes. but governments cannot tackle all of them at once. given limitations in their financial and executive capacity. This gave rise to the idea of concentrating these limited resources on the binding constraint. which would be identified going through a tool conceptualised as a decision tree. The proponents of the original growth diagnostics also realised that this binding constraint varies between countries and - we would argue - between sectors.  The central point of the original growth diagnostics method was that it offered researchers and policy makers a way of identifying priorities in analysis and policy; and finding solutions which take into account local conditions. The same rationale applies to our Green Growth Diagnostic project. We build on the original approach but adapt it in four ways: 1. Applying it to the energy sector; 2. Taking into account potential knock-on effects on the economy; 3. The political economy when going from diagnostics to therapeutics; and 4. Working out the distributional consequences. Since each step takes the project into un(der)explored territory. it is built around five research questions and corresponding methodologically distinct work packages.

The development. transfer and use of renewable energy technologies are promising ways towards low‐carbon development in these countries.

1300481,The political economy of investment in renewable electricity in Kenya,2017,Helen Osiol and Ana Pueyo and James Gachanja,,,,,Institute of Development Studies,Kenya has been hailed as a successful sub-Saharan African country in attracting private investment for renewable energy. However. energy poverty remains very high. with connectivity rates lower than the average for sub-Saharan Africa and poor quality of supply for those connected. Several constraints persist to achieve universal access to clean and affordable electricity: high system costs. including a deficient  transmission and distribution infrastructure; low rural demand and inadequate planning to meet it; and local opposition to large renewable infrastructure. This article considers the political economy of these constraints. explaining how they arose. which policies can address them and which actors back or oppose these policies. The overarching message is that a prominent state role is required to fund the network components of the electricity system and to reach the less profitable segments of society. namely the rural poor.

1300482,Green Investment Diagnostics for Africa: What are the Binding Constraints to Investment in Renewables in Kenya and Ghana?,2017,Ana Pueyo and Stephen Spratt and Simon Bawakyillenuo and Helen Hoka Osiolo,,,,,Institute of Development Studies,The vast potential of renewable energy is failing to be realised in many African countries. in spite of the many pledges made by donors and international financiers. This is not due to a lack of policies supporting investment. Many African countries have renewable energy targets. feed-in-tariffs (FiT). or import duty exemptions for renewable energy technologies. In some cases these policies are not fully implemented. In others they are implemented but. put in the language of this report. they are not targeting the most binding constraints to investment. Whatever the reason for their lack of success. it is clear that simply introducing formal policies is not enough.  This Research Report presents the Green Investment Diagnostics methodology that aims at supporting policymakers to better target policies for the promotion of renewable energy investment. Our approach draws from the original Growth Diagnostics developed by Hausmann. Rodrik and Velasco (2004) to identify the most binding constraints to economic growth in developing countries. We adapt that approach to the particular case of the energy sector. so that we can identify the main bottlenecks faced by renewable energy investors in a particular country.  We start by asking: for this particular country. at this particular time. what is preventing higher levels of investment in renewable energy generation technologies for which there is an economic rationale? To answer this question we follow a systematic approach. which starts with a decision tree analysis and continues with the cumulative building of evidence to back up potentially binding constraints.

To date. much of this research has focused on developed countries. but the need for this shift is increasingly being recognised as important in countries at all levels of development. The circumstances of these countries are different. however. suggesting that approaches to policy identification and evaluation may also need to be adapted. These differences are found in three areas: first. many developing country governments face severe budget constraints and competing calls on public resources to address poverty. The finances available to support policy mechanisms are therefore more limited than in many developed countries. Second. given the immaturity of financial systems. the most important obstacles to investment in renewable energy may be unrelated to the specifics of these investments. but reflect more general problems. Third. while issues of political economy are important for power sectors everywhere. they can be particularly pronounced in developing country settings. Before we can assess the potential effectiveness of different policy mechanisms to support renewable energy investment in developing countries. therefore. we need first to understand what the most important constraints to these investments are. Given the very large number of potential constraints. an approach is needed to narrow this set systematically. and identify those constraints which are most important. or ‘binding’.

1300486,The evidence of benefits for poor people of electricity provision: scoping note and review protocol,2013,Matthew Lockwood and Ana Pueyo,,,Evidence Report; 22,,Institute of Development Studies (IDS),At one level. the relationship between electricity. economic growth and the elimination of poverty is obvious. At the aggregate level. no country has achieved a high level of per capita income and welfare without a functioning electricity system. At the level of individual households. access to a reliable supply of electricity by poor households is thought to contribute significantly to overcoming a number of barriers. including: limited opportunities for children to study; severe constraints on economic opportunities; negative health effects via inability to store food safely; and constraints on the ability to access information via TV. radio and mobile phones. It may have negative effects on the provision of services. including health. education and pumped water. Finally. limited access and poor reliability of supply more widely across the economy may prevent the reduction of poverty through constraining economic growth.   However. the evidence for the exact relationships between the provision of electricity on the one hand and the reduction of poverty on the other are not as well understood as they could be. Although there are some existing reviews of particular aspects of the relationship between electricity and poverty. an up-to-date. rigorous assessment of the evidence base designed to inform DFID’s programming is absent.

Results show that the presence of a high thermal conductivity liquid metal such as mercury enables the hot water to lose much more of its initial thermal energy content. than when only water alone flows in the channel. However. too unjustified excessive mercury co-flowing with the hot water can lead to adverse effects in regards to the heat loss from the hot water. The reason behind the enhanced heat transfer between the two liquids is due to the initiation of high temperature gradients sites inside the channel. especially in the region of the interface between the two liquids. in addition to the high thermal conductivity of mercury. as compared to water thermal conductivity.

Int. Communication in Heat and Mass Transfer. 2011) the heat transfer enhancement between two immiscible liquids with clear disparity in thermal conductivity such as water and a liquid metal (attained by co-flowing them in a direct contact manner alongside each other in mini channel) was demonstrated. The present work includes preliminary experimental results that support those numerical findings. Two immiscible liquids (hot water and liquid gallium) are allowed experimentally to exchange heat (under noflow conditions) in a stationary metallic cup where they are put in direct contact. The experimental results confirm the significant heat exchange enhancement. The superior thermal conductivity of the used liquid metal as compared with the water is the reason behind the observed enhancement in heat transfer. For the same residence time and the same contact surface area between the two liquids. however. the experiments show a slightly slower rate in the heat transfer between the two liquids compared to the case of the channel flow considered in the numerical simulations. This discrepancy is justified on the basis of the additional enhancements brought about by the forced convectional effects in the case of the channel flow (which are absent in the experiments where conduction and natural convection prevail).,True,TSuYGTAAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC,4,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1071.4340&rep=rep1&type=pdf,16450843970838345472,/scholar?cites=16450843970838345472,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1071.4340&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Increasing international attention has focused on improved cookstoves (ICS) as a vehicle for reducing household air pollution. regional environmental and climate impacts. Biogas plants are a type of improved cooking technology. However. dissemination programs for ICS (including biogas) have met with mixed results. and biogas plants often suffer from operational and structural challenges. This analysis of ICS adoption adds to the limited literature informing cookstove dissemination programs. In a sample of households from Odisha. India. we find households with ICS have higher socioeconomic and educational status. while households with only a traditional stove spend more money on fuel and more time in hospitals treating respiratory disease. Hours of ICS use is significantly associated with less time spent collecting fuel and fewer days in the hospital for respiratory disease. We find that household receipt of higher subsidies for plant construction; livestock ownership and less time collecting wood are associated with ownership of biogas plants that remain functional. We also add to the scant field evidence of ICS impacts on fuel use and confirm that ownership of ICS including biogas stoves is associated with a significant decrease in fuelwood consumption.,True,9xkv1RwAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,18,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Somnath-Hazra-6/publication/313023671_Adoption_and_Use_of_Improved_Stoves_and_Biogas_Plants_in_Rural_India/links/588cc8ad92851cef136184b2/Adoption-and-Use-of-Improved-Stoves-and-Biogas-Plants-in-Rural-India.pdf,15814380720210593289,/scholar?cites=15814380720210593289,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Somnath-Hazra-6/publication/313023671_Adoption_and_Use_of_Improved_Stoves_and_Biogas_Plants_in_Rural_India/links/588cc8ad92851cef136184b2/Adoption-and-Use-of-Improved-Stoves-and-Biogas-Plants-in-Rural-India.pdf,0,0,0

Environmental health problems draw particular concern. because they affect people who live in mineral-rich areas but do not necessarily derive benefits from mining. This parallels worldwide concerns about “the social and spatial distribution of both mining’s benefits and its socioeconomic and environmental costs”(Bridge 2004) and well-publicized conflicts between mining companies and local communities (Kemp. Owen. Gotzmann. and Bond 2010). We examine the impacts of iron ore mining in Keonjhar district in the eastern Indian state of Orissa. The common argument in favor of mining is that it generates employment in underdeveloped regions. Thus. we first quantify the proportion and distribution of local people employed in mining. Second. we use our model of employment to control for occupational effects (including both direct occupational health effects and indirect income effects) in models of environmental health.

The co-occurrence of poor economic performance and natural resource abundance is an empirical regularity. The extensive literature on this ‘resource curse’phenomenon at the national level generally finds that economic dependence on point resources such as minerals is associated with lower levels of economic growth and human welfare. Various explanations have been offered for this association. many related to trade. rent-seeking. and national political institutions. Our premise is that further insight can be obtained through consideration of the resource curse at the micro level. because of heterogeneity in institutions. natural resources and economic behaviors. We empirically test the resource curse at the household and village level in Orissa. India. using data from household surveys and secondary community statistics. Specifically. we examine the possibility that iron ore mining undermines welfare. as represented most fundamentally by health status. conditional on wage earnings. Clearly. mining workers could face occupational health issues from employment in the mine. but direct impacts on individuals are at least potentially compensated through wage differentials. Of greater concern are environmental health effects that occur through degradation of water quality. air quality. or forest resources that are central to the livelihoods of tribal populations in the mining belt.

The paper analyses the generation mix of the states and their investment in converting them in to CDM opportunity in the interest of climate justice in moderating emission.Findings: It has been observed that the renewable energy generation is highly correlated with CDM project investment at the state level. Moreover states with higher thermal generation too do make effort to moderate emission by investing in CDM projects.Originality/Value: The paper hitherto ventures in to the uncharted area of the climate justice at the sub-national level within the boundary of a nation. So far the debates focussed on climate justice in the context of developing and developed nations. This paper tries to see what kind of incentive be there to develop a domestic carbon market in the interest of climate justice in the field of energy generation like it has been done in the context of energy efficiency.,True,9xkv1RwAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://www.ijcrr.com/uploads/347_pdf.pdf,,,,,https://www.ijcrr.com/uploads/347_pdf.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. multi-scale nested watersheds were delineated and the relationships between two representative water quality indexes and agricultural land use intensity were assessed and quantified for the year 2000 using multi-scale regression analysis. The results show that the log-transformed nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3-N) index exhibited a relationship with chemical fertilizer input intensity and several natural factors. including soil loss. rainfall and sunlight at the first order watershed scale. while permanganate index (COD Mn) had a positive relationship with another two input intensities of pesticides and agricultural plastic mulch and organic manure at the fifth order watershed scale. The first order watershed and the fifth order watershed were considered as the watershed adaptive response units for NO 3-N and COD Mn. respectively. The adjustment of agricultural input and its intensity may be carried out inside the individual watershed adaptive response unit. The multiple linear regression model demonstrated the cause-and-effect relationship between agricultural land use intensity and stream water quality at multiple scales. which is an important factor for the maintenance of stream water quality.

This study evaluated the impact of variability in different climatic factors keeping the other factors constant on spring wheat production in North Dakota from 2007 to 2011. The spring wheat yield mainly depends on the climatic changes during growing periods April to September. Average maximum air temperature was significantly different from April to September except June from 2007 to 2011. High average minimum and maximum air temperatures during planting time increase yield and planting area for 2010.

Eighty-five years of field data were collected and the trend of average minimum temperature along with average maximum temperature. average precipitation. and spring wheat yield was analyzed using Mann-Kendall test. The study area was divided into 9 divisions based on physical locations. The minimum temperature plays an important role in the region as it impacts the physiological development of the crops. Increasing trend was noticed for 6 divisions for average minimum temperature and average precipitation during growing season. Northeast and Southeast division showed the strongest increasing trend for average minimum temperature and average precipitation. respectively. East-central division had the most decreasing trend for average maximum temperature. A significant relationship was established between spring wheat yield and climatic parameters as the p-value is lower than 0.05 level which rejects the null hypothesis.

Also. the strategy to sequestrate CO2 from natural gas will require gas turbines to run with hydrogen-based fuels. In such scenarios. high temperature low emission combustion of hydrogen is a key requirement for the future gas turbine market. Ansaldo Energia’s gas turbines featuring sequential combustion have an intrinsic advantage when it comes to fuel flexibility and in particular hydrogen-based fuels.

The potential solutions of energy storage of excess generation from renewables through hydrogen production and precombustion carbon capture are gaining momentum. Both scenarios require gas turbines capable of operation with hydrogen-based fuels. At the same time. the composition of natural gas considered for use within gas turbines is becoming significantly more variable due to increased use of liquefied natural gas and a wider range of gas sources and extraction methods. Fuel flexibility. both in terms of the amount of hydrogen and higher hydrocarbons is therefore of utmost importance in modern gas turbine development. This paper provides an overview of key steps taken in the design and development of an operation concept. leveraging the advantage of the GT36 Constant Pressure Sequential Combustion system (CPSC)—a premixed low emission reheat combustion technology. characterised by an extremely broad fuel range capability. composed of two combustion stages in series. The results presented in this paper clearly show that the complementarity behaviour of first and second combustion stages—extensively proven for fuels containing high concentrations of higher hydrocarbons—can be extended to hydrogen.

Device replacement due to battery depletion may cause complications and is costly. The goal of energy harvesting devices is to power the implant with energy from intracorporeal power sources such as vibrations and blood flow. By replacing primary batteries with energy harvesters. reinterventions can be avoided and the size of the total device might be reduced. This paper introduces a device with a lever. which is deflected by the blood stream within the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). an attractive site for cardiac pacing. The resulting torque is converted to electrical energy by an electromagnetic mechanism.

Contemporary pacemakers are reliable and allow for a patient specific programming. However. pacemaker replacements due to battery depletion are common (~ 25% of all implantation procedures) and bear the risk of complications. Batteryless pacemakers may allow overcoming this limitation. To power a batteryless pacemaker. a mechanism for intracorporeal energy harvesting is required. Such a generator may consist out of subcutaneously implanted solar cells. transforming the small amount of transcutaneously available light into electrical energy. Alternatively. intravascular turbines may harvest energy from the blood flow. Energy may also be harvested from the ventricular wall motion by a dedicated mechanical clockwork converting motion into electrical energy. All these approaches have successfully been tested in vivo. Pacemaker leads constitute another Achilles heel of contemporary pacemakers. Thus. leadless devices are desired. Miniaturized pacemaker circuits and suitable energy harvesting mechanisms (incorporated in a single device) may allow catheter-based implantation of the pacemaker in the heart.

ETA SA. Grenchen. Switzerland). The clockwork was freed from all time indicating parts. Its custommade housing (total mass 16.7 g. figure 1) allowed it to be anchored on the heart. For an in-vivo study with a 60 kg domestic pic. a sternotomy was performed to suture the prototype onto the anteroapical part of the left ventricle. Subsequently. the harvesting device was connected to a custom-built single-chamber pacemaker. A 47 µF capacitor was integrated to overcome the energy shortage between consecutive generator signals. Finally. an epicardial bipolar pacing wire (TME 66T. Osypka. Germany) was used to deliver the pacemaker stimulus.Results: The heart successfully accelerated the energy harvesting device. It supplied the pacemaker with enough energy to performed continuous VVI pacing (pacing threshold 1.0 V/0.5 ms. sensing 9.8 mV. impedance 1279 Ω) at 130 bpm (pacing output 1.6 V/0.8 ms. arrows in figure 2 indicate pacing stimuli). Simultaneously. the harvesting device generated a mean output power of 52 µW over an additional load resistor of 1kΩ.Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility of pacing the heart using its own mechanical activity. The harvested energy exceeded the power requirement of a modern pacemaker (~ 10 µW). Furthermore. we expect to increase the performance by optimising this first-generation prototype.

To increase efficiency in terms of providing uniform illumination in the interior. the current need is to illuminate optical fiber-bundle with uniform light flux. To this end. we propose a method for achieving collimated light. which illuminates the fiber-bundle uniformly. Light is collected through a parabolic concentrator and focused toward a collimating lens. which distributes the light over each optical fiber. An optics diffusing structure is utilized at the end side of the fiber bundle to spread light in the interior. The results clearly reveal that the efficiency in terms of uniform illumination. which also reduces the heat problem for optical fibers. is improved.

Daylighting systems based on solar concentrators and fiber optical transmission have attracted a lot of research attention. In this paper. the authors propose a daylight collection and transmission design to transmit the concentrated light more uniformly into the optical fibers employing two optical elements: an eight-fold Fresnel lens as the primary optical element (POE) and an octagonal spherical fiber connector as the secondary optical element (SOE).

It is clear throughout history that daylight has been an important element to affect health and lighting quality in the architectural designing. Different methods have been developed to bring daylight inside the building. Most of the methods have not been adopted because of their low efficiency and installation problems. What is the possible solution and current need to provide daylight in the buildings?Besides energy saving. daylight has positive influence. which improves the quality of life. on the human body (eg. feelings and emotions). Daylight research has shown that it can be used to reduce the impact of illnesses (eg. seasonal affective disorder) and improve patient recovery rapidly [1]. As daylight includes visible and non-visible light. the eyes and skin absorb non-visible wavelengths that are needed to synthesize vitamin D3. People spend most of their time under artificial light in buildings. As a result. 15% of office workers complain of eye strain. and 78 million have calcium deficiency due to insufficient vitamin D [2]. Low levels of vitamin D have been shown to increase the risk of strokes and heart attacks by 60%[1].

Identification of the systemically important firms is one of the main issues in order to mitigate and control the systemic risk events. In this paper. different network-based systemic risk measures are introduced and compared to each other to identify systemically important firms. These measures are divided in to the interconnectedness and the size measures. Using cross-holding data of Tehran Stock Exchange and network theory principles. the systemically important firms and sectors are identified and their relations are assessed. The results show that the application of integrated cross-holding network leads to a better understanding of the systemic risk in the considered financial market. Moreover. a combination of interconnectedness and size measures can lead to more reliable results. The statistical analysis of the results indicates that there are few firms which have a dominant role in the occurrence of financial systemic risk according to different measures. JEL: C6. E44. G10.

The method is proposed as performing. with a simplified ventilation model. thermal–airflow simulations of 27 common cases of dwellings (considered as one thermal zone) based on the combination of specific features of the building design. occupancy and climate conditions. The energy saving potential is assessed then by the use of a new assessment method suitable for large-scale scenarios using the actual number of air-conditioned dwellings distributed among the 27 cases.

To achieve this. two approaches are taken into account. The first one is the usage of low-energy devices. and the second one is the decrease of their time of use. These two approaches are considered in the calculation method with random values of power and time of usage. The energy activities are divided into air-conditioning. illumination & appliances. and refrigeration. After total annual use is validated with the actual values of energy use in 2015. a sensitivity analysis of the approaches used separately and together is carried out in order to determine the potential of energy saving. Thereby. it is found that the most influential parameter for energy saving is the extensive acquisition of more efficient technologies of illumination & appliances. followed by the decrease of use of the same illumination & appliances. Furthermore. with an integrated approach that takes into account both the use of efficient devices and the reduction of their use for the three energy activities. a maximum of 19.67 TWh is calculated in 2015 for the Mexican residential sector. This approach is therefore expected to have a reliable basis for the development and improvement of policies that help to drive energy savings in an extensive manner in Mexico.

1300676,The Influence of an Integrated Driving on the Performance of Different Passive Heating and Cooling Methods for Buildings,2019,Ivan Oropeza-Perez,9,Buildings,11,224,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Passive cooling and heating methods within buildings are studied a lot nowadays. Nevertheless. their performance considering their driving has not been deeply studied. Therefore. the performance of the most common passive heating and cooling methods is analyzed in this document. The methods are divided into three categories: operable. semi-operable. and not operable. They are studied under different conditions of operation in order to estimate their performance in terms of indoor temperature increase/decrease in a single dwelling. The study is carried out with the thermal simulation program EnergyPlus. using a dwelling in Mexico City as a case study. which is validated with literature that studied passive methods for similar climates. Furthermore. for an integrated driving. four features of operation of the passive methods are considered: mobility. maintenance. assembly. and consumables. The results show that a correct use of these features of driving might achieve a significant temperature drop in the case of cooling and a significant indoor temperature increase in the case of heating. This is reflected in a considerable amount of energy saving compared to a conventional heating/cooling heat-pump system running under regular conditions. which is taken as a reference of consumption. Thereby. it is concluded that the proper usage. considered here as the correct application of the four features of operation mainly by the occupants. might have a high influence in their performance of increase/decrease of the indoor temperature.

By using a top-down approach. a simplified numerical model is developed. which is used to simulate the urban heat island effect. and that deals with the performance of various cooling methods according to the physical. urban. and climatic characteristics of the urban site. The calculated results of outdoor air temperature considering the heat island effect achieve good agreement with the already-published results. Then. different methods of shading and cooling. varying physical values such as urban thermal transmittance. and urban thermal absorption are applied in order to find the most influencing feature upon the indoor temperature drop into a simulation loop. With this. it is found that a maximum average decrease of indoor temperature of 5.1 C can be achieved. Furthermore. carrying out a sensitivity analysis. it is found that the albedo of both building surface and urban layout is the most influencing parameter onto the indoor thermal comfort.

Several reasons drive to the use of this type of active cooling method: its reliability. its control and its efficiency to reach thermal comfort under extreme conditions are amongst of them (Zhou et al.. 2015). Nevertheless. the utilization of this cooling technique increases the electricity demand of the building (International Energy Agency. 2013).Because of a great extent of the most consuming countries of AC have a mostly fossil-fuel-based electricity generation (International Energy Agency. 2013). the extensive use of AC increases the climate change effect (International Energy Agency. 2013). Mexico is amongst these countries. having an electricity demand for AC within the residential sector calculated at 8.9 TWh in 2011 (3% of the total national demand)(Oropeza-Perez and Østergaard. 2014).,True,-RvKk4sAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1421211.pdf,,,,,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1421211.pdf,0,0,0

The aim is to show the benefits for utilizing natural airflow instead of active systems such as mechanical ventilation or air-conditioning in buildings where the indoor temperature is over the upper limit of the comfort range. The combination is done by introducing the energy saving output-calculated with a model of natural ventilation using a thermal air flow simulation program-Into the energy systems analysis model. Descriptions of the energy systems in two geographical locations. ie Mexico and Denmark. are set up as inputs. Then. the assessment is done by calculating the energy impacts as well as environmental benefits in the energy systems analysis.

Temporary Debt Restructuring. and Firm Performance: Evidence from Contract-Level Data,2016,Daisuke Miyakawa and Kazuhiko Ohashi,,Asian Finance Association (AsianFA) 2016 Conference,,,,This paper empirically examines the cause and consequence of private debt restructuring out of court. Using a unique contract-level data accounting for Japanese bank loan. we employ probit and multinomial logit estimations to study how demand and approval of debt restructuring are determined. as well as under what conditions one specific form of debt restructuring–temporary debt restructuring–is utilized. The results of our estimations show. first. that the demand of debt restructuring was systematically associated with firm characteristics and the relation-specific characteristics (esp.. number of lender banks). Second. debt restructurings was more likely to take “temporary” form when the number of lender banks was larger. Using propensity score matching difference-in-difference estimation. we also find that the performance of firms experiencing temporary debt restructuring significantly deteriorated in the comparison with that of firms experiencing non-temporary debt restructuring. These results imply that temporary debt restructuring during our sample period was mainly used as de fact evergreening lending. which ended up the deterioration of borrower creditworthiness.,True,G75kdEsAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,4,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2724456,14312255579487368425,/scholar?cites=14312255579487368425,,,https://www.sba.hub.hit-u.ac.jp/assets/files/research/fs_wp/FS-2016-E-002.pdf,0,0,0
1300719,Detrimental Effects of Retention Regulation–Incentives of Loan Screening in Securitization Under Asymmetric Information,2011,Masazumi Hattori and Kazuhiko Ohashi,,Available at SSRN 1784487,,,,We consider an economy where a lender finances his loans to borrowers by issuing a securitized product to investors and where the credit quality of the product may depend on whether the lender screens the borrowers. In the presence of asymmetric information between the lender and the investors about the credit quality of potential borrowers that the lender faces. overvaluation (from the lender’s viewpoint) of the low quality securitized product may occur. which reduces the lender’s incentive to conduct costly screening of the borrowers and hence leads to issuance of the securitized product of low credit quality. This is likely to occur when the probability is low that the average credit-quality of potential borrowers is low. Hence. in the OTD business model. the low quality product tends to be issued just after the economic boom hits the peak. or when some of the lending opportunities start deteriorating. but not in the recession where majority of the lending opportunities are already bad. In this situation. we investigate the efficacy of retention regulation that requires the lender to hold a minimum ratio of his own securitized products. and find that such regulation is not necessarily effective to solve this incentive problem. Even worse. in a certain situation. the retention regulation discourages the lender's screening effort and reduces welfare.,True,G75kdEsAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,4,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1784487,6131613347572783066,/scholar?cites=6131613347572783066,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.687.9220&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1300722,The Most Basic Missing Instrument in Financial Markets: The Case for Bonds for Financial Security,2016,Arun Muralidhar and Kazuhiko Ohashi and Sung Hwan Shin,16,Journal of Investment Consulting,2,34-47,,The move to defined contribution plans has transferred risk to individuals who are least capable of bearing such risk and requires them to make complex decisions for which they are not prepared. Accumulation (investments) and decumulation (annuity purchase) decisions are complex. costly. often with different entities (asset managers and insurance companies). result in illiquid investments (annuities). and still may result in highly uncertain pensions (because of interest-rate volatility). This paper argues that governments globally can address the shortcomings by issuing a new type of bond that matches the needs of investors saving for retirement. This financial instrument is basically an inflation-linked bond that pays coupons when you need it. We call these Bonds for Financial Security (BFFS) and argue that this single instrument can help investors achieve retirement objectives at lower risk. lower cost. and with greater liquidity and greater simplicity than portfolios created through a mix of traditional stocks and bonds followed by annuity purchases. The need for such a bond is simple to understand: A typical saver sets aside resources today to receive a stream of income post-retirement (for a fixed period) and the BFFS is the “riskless asset” because it guarantees the purchasing power post-retirement. The paper goes further to demonstrate that there is a potentially willing supplier of such bonds—governments that need to invest in infrastructure and have a desire to prevent a retirement crisis. thereby completing the market. The cash flows of such a bond are contrasted with those of infrastructure projects to show how such bonds may foster …,True,G75kdEsAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,3,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2880002,15927088329396706209,/scholar?cites=15927088329396706209,,,,0,0,0

Therefore. we studied 17 recent storage expansion studies pertinent to the U.S.. Europe. and Germany. We then systemized the storage requirement per variable renewable energy (VRE) share and generation technology. Our synthesis reveals that with increasing VRE shares. the EES power capacity increases linearly; and the energy capacity. exponentially.

The ever-increasing complexity of the systems under consideration leads to an increase in mathematical problem size of the models. This implies limitations of today’s common solution approaches especially with regard to required computing times. To tackle this challenge many model-based speed-up approaches exist which. however. are typically only demonstrated on small generic test cases. In addition. in applied energy systems analysis the effects of such approaches are often not well understood. The novelty of this study is the systematic evaluation of several model reduction and heuristic decomposition techniques for a large applied energy system model using real data and particularly focusing on reachable speed-up. The applied model is typically used for examining German energy scenarios and allows expansion of storage and electricity transmission capacities. We find that initial computing times of more than two days can be reduced up to a factor of ten while having acceptable loss of accuracy. Moreover. we explain what we mean by “effectiveness of model reduction” which limits the possible speed-up with shared memory computers used in this study.

Electrical energy storage (EES) is a promising option to tackle this matter and its required capacity is typically studied with model-based assessments. However. such analyses barley account for uncertainties in data assumptions or the chosen methodology. and. in consequence. lack an understanding of the robustness of the derived EES capacity. Therefore. this thesis aims to shed light on the main drivers for EES demand in highly renewable European energy systems in a comprehensive approach. considering parametric and methodological uncertainty. Using and enhancing the linear optimization model REMix. this study analyzes the required storage capacity and its utilization for northern. western. and central Europe in energy scenarios with high shares of renewable power generation (> 80%). The robustness of the storage capacity was tested against a large set of parameter variations (e.g. cost parameters or the meteorological year as input for VRE power) and methodological assumptions. The latter include different levels of technological detail (e.g. modeling approaches for thermal power plants). variations in the spatial and temporal resolution. as well as more general assumptions (e.g. restricted curtailments).

1300794,Global study of geomagnetic induced current using time derivatives of geomagnetic fields,2009,EO Falayi and N Beloff,,Canadian Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences,,943,,This report investigates variations in time derivatives of the geomagnetic field observed during great storms known to have caused disruption and to have had other adverse effects on power grids. The geomagnetic storms considered were those of 24th November 2004. 30th October 2003 and 28th October 2004. which occurred during the Autumnal event. and also 7th April 2000 and 31st March 2001 which occurred during the Spring events. Geomagnetic field variations are associated with geoelectric field variation at the surface of the Earth which is influenced by the conductivities of different structures of the Earth’s interior. The induced electric field is proportional to the rate of change of the geomagnetic field. which explains why many researchers have used time derivatives of the geomagnetic field as a measure of GIC strength. Koen and Gaunt (2002) established that variation exceeding 30nT/min of the time derivatives of the geomagnetic field component appears to be significant. causing undesirable consequences in power grids.,True,lSVX9XUAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,5,https://covenantuniversity.edu.ng/layout/set/print/content/download/3669/27429/file/Ajani-Nwinyi%20CJPAS.pdf#page=67,17304586510353002420,/scholar?cites=17304586510353002420,,,https://covenantuniversity.edu.ng/layout/set/print/content/download/3669/27429/file/Ajani-Nwinyi%20CJPAS.pdf#page=67,0,0,0

A Wiley Company,A new method is demonstrated to quantify local ring strain. which is based on the expectation value of orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis. In contrast to energy based methods which provide overall ring strain. this method is able to identify the local strain in every part of the ring. The formalism is benchmarked on several cycloalkanes in which the presence of ring strain is well understood. The ring strain plays a decisive role in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) properties; for instance. the hydrogen storage capability of CNTs is related to their diameter. which in turn has a close relation to the ring strain in their CC bonds. On this basis. the ring strain in five CNTs with different diameters is analyzed and the results reflected meaningful correlation between the CNTs diameter and ring strain. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals.

We simulate in Aspen Plus using detailed thermodynamic models with coupled oligomerization reactions and rigorous unit operation models. The overall exergy efficiency of OME3–5 production from H2 and CO2 using established process concepts is 53%. Therein. the trioxane process step has the highest losses due to its high heat demand.

Examining preferences of German car drivers for fuel innovations,2019,Anika Linzenich and Katrin Arning and Dominik Bongartz and Alexander Mitsos and Martina Ziefle,249,Applied Energy,,222-236,Elsevier,In the search for sustainable transport solutions. fuel production from renewable resources has received significant attention. Some proposed synthetic fuels have favorable combustion properties compared to existing fuels. e.g.. significant reductions in pollutant formation. However. penetration of such fuels requires a favorable social acceptance. as demonstrated by the consumer boycott of the ethanol-blend fuel with 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline (E10) in Germany. Therefore. the consumer perspective and their preferences regarding alternative fuels should be considered in the fuel design.

However. little is known about its combustion characteristics. In this work. we used our recently assembled and validated detailed chemical reaction mechanism to examine some of the combustion properties of sour gas with different compositions in both conventional air combustion and oxy-fuel combustion. the latter being motivated by application in carbon capture and storage.

1300852,Linearization of McCormick relaxations and hybridization with the auxiliary variable method,2021,Jaromił Najman and Dominik Bongartz and Alexander Mitsos,,Journal of Global Optimization,,1-26,Springer US,The computation of lower bounds via the solution of convex lower bounding problems depicts current state-of-the-art in deterministic global optimization. Typically. the nonlinear convex relaxations are further underestimated through linearizations of the convex underestimators at one or several points resulting in a lower bounding linear optimization problem. The selection of linearization points substantially affects the tightness of the lower bounding linear problem. Established methods for the computation of such linearization points. eg. the sandwich algorithm. are already available for the auxiliary variable method used in state-of-the-art deterministic global optimization solvers. In contrast. no such methods have been proposed for the (multivariate) McCormick relaxations. The difficulty of determining a good set of linearization points for the McCormick technique lies in the fact that no auxiliary variables are introduced and thus. the linearization points have to be determined in the space of original optimization variables. We propose algorithms for the computation of linearization points for convex relaxations constructed via the (multivariate) McCormick theorems. We discuss alternative approaches based on an adaptation of Kelley’s algorithm; computation of all vertices of an n-simplex; a combination of the two; and random selection.

1300984,Economic and environmental impact of lead-acid batteries in grid-connected domestic PV systems,2013,E McKenna and M McManus and S Cooper and M Thomson,,Applied Energy,,,,Occupants of dwellings with grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems can often benefit financially from exporting electricity to the grid. When export prices are lower than import prices. however. occupants are incentivised to time-shift demand in order to avoid exports and reduce imports. To maximise this potential financial benefit. the addition of batteries to the PV system has been proposed to take advantage of the specific commercial opportunity presented to the occupant of trading exported power during the day for imported power during the evening. This paper therefore assesses the economic and environmental impact of the use of lead-acid batteries in grid-connected PV systems under current feed-in tariff arrangements in the UK.

The emphasis is in indicating the effect of a wide range of operating conditions and methodologies. rather than detailed analysis of the performance of the units under limited specific circumstances. The effect of control methodologies is the primary focus but other variables such as the climate and the specification of the buildings to which heat is supplied are considered. Several significant findings emerge. Firstly. a reduction in heating demands due to warmer will reduce the impacts of both heating systems. In the case of ASHPs. lower heat demands improve performance. In the case of SOFC-mCHP systems they reduce the need for auxiliary heating.

A literature review was conducted which identified that benchmarks were either produced through a top-down process using annual production and fuel consumption data or through a bottom-up process from process-level data.

These are run for short periods in the summer just to provide hot water. this tends to be inefficient. In places with a constant solar climate it should be possible to rely on solar energy to provide domestic hot water. however many northern cities have a large daily variation in solar radiation. The potential of solar water heaters to meet the hot water demand of a household throughout the summer period in a wide range of cities was investigated.

In this context. the government released its ‘Clean Growth Strategy’ in October 2017. although it has a number of limitations. The associated technology roadmaps exhibit quite large uncertainties. and reducing carbon dioxide emissions over the long term will depend critically on the adoption of a small number of key technologies. alongside the ‘decarbonisation’ of electricity supply. ‘Circular economy’ interventions have the potential to make significant energy savings that are complementary to other energy-efficiency measures.

1300995,Thermodynamic analysis of air source heat pumps and micro combined heat and power units participating in a distributed energy future,2013,Samuel JG Cooper,,,,,,There is a clear requirement to reduce Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions (IPCC 2007; Stern 2006). In the UK this requirement has been formalised as a legislative obligation to achieve an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions rates (relative to 1990 rates) by 2050 (HM Government 2008). Achieving this will require a substantial change to the way in which domestic space heating is provided. Although options such as the use of biomass and improvements in the insulation of dwellings are likely to fulfil some of this requirement. most proposals include the electrification of heating with decarbonised electricity (DECC 2012; Boardman 2007b; DECC 2009b).Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP) and micro-Combined Heat and Power (mCHP) units both have the potential to contribute to achieving a low-carbon society and so it is necessary to understand the ways in which operating conditions may affect their performance. Their performance characteristics are of particular interest given that both technologies have significant electrical power flows associated with them in addition to heat flows. Field trials (eg Carbon Trust 2011; Lipp 2012; Energy Saving Trust 2010) and modelling (eg Kelly & Cockroft 2011; Dorer & Weber 2009) have demonstrated that a range of performances might be achieved by the units. depending upon both the characteristics of the units themselves but also the conditions in which they are operated. A wider study of the relative effect that these factors have is therefore justified. A range of technologies is available and so it will be more relevant to investigate the trends which occur rather than the performance of specific devices under specific …,True,Mf5vQ-wAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,12,https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/files/187928049/UnivBath_PhD_2013_S_J_G_Cooper.pdf,10984899018278331115,/scholar?cites=10984899018278331115,,,https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/files/187928049/UnivBath_PhD_2013_S_J_G_Cooper.pdf,0,0,0

This will have a dramatic impact on the demands for primary materials and energy. It has been estimated that with improvements in design and manufacturing it is possible to maintain the current level of production using 70% of the current primary material consumed. Even with these improvements on the production side. there will still be a doubling of primary material requirements by the end of the century. with accompanying rises in industrial energy demand. if the rise in demand for goods and  services is to be met. It is therefore clear that the consumption of products must also be explored. Product longevity and using goods more intensively are two strategies which could reduce the demand for new goods. If products last longer. then manufacturing output can concentrate on emerging markets rather than the market for replacement goods. There are many goods which are infrequently used. these seldom wear out. The total demand for such could be drastically reduced if they we re shared with other people. Sharing of goods has traditionally been conducted between friends or by hiring equipment. but modern communication systems and social media could increase the opportunities to share goods. Sharing goods also increases access to a range of goods for those on low incomes.

1300998,Potential of demand side management to reduce carbon dioxide emissions associated with the operation of heat pumps.,2013,S Cooper and J Dowsett and G Hammond and M McManus and J Rogers,,,,,,This work considers the potential reduction in the carbon dioxide emissions associated with the operation of Air Source Heat Pump which could be achieved by using demand side management. In order to achieve significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. it is widely envisioned that electrification of the heating sector will need to be combined with decarbonisation of the electrical supply. By influencing the times at when electric heat pumps operate such that they coincide more with electricity generation which has a low marginal carbon emissions factor. it has been suggested that these emissions could be reduced further. In order to investigate this possibility. models of the UK electrical grid based on scenarios for 2020 to 2050 have been combined with a dynamic model of an air source heat pump unit and thermal models of a population of dwellings. The performance and carbon dioxide emissions associated with the heat pumps are compared both with and without demand side management interventions intended to give preference to operation when the marginal emissions factor of the electricity being generated is low. It is found that these interventions are unlikely to be effective at achieving further reductions in emissions. A reduction of around 3% was observed in scenarios based around 2035 but in other scenarios the reduction was insignificant. In the scenarios with high wind generation (2050). the DSM scheme considered here tends to improve thermal comfort (with minimal increases in emissions) rather than achieving a decrease in emissions. The reasons for this are discussed and further recommendations are made.,True,Mf5vQ-wAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,10,https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=155289,10146928721582792544,/scholar?cites=10146928721582792544,,,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/155289,0,0,0

1301000,Use of micro CHP plants to support the local operation of electric heat pumps,2013,John Rogers and Samuel Cooper and Geoff Hammond and Marcelle McManus,,3rd International Conference in Microgeneration and Related Technologies in Buildings: Microgen 3,,,University of Bath,There is a common assumption that to decarbonise the heat market in the UK a large number of households will need to switch from fossil fuel heating to heating with low carbon electricity. Electric heat pumps are the most energy efficient way of using electricity for space heating so it would appear logical to promote their use. Domestic electricity demand is highly stochastic and distribution supply transformers are sized to take advantage of load aggregation. This results in the transformers having capabilities between 1.4 and 9.8 KW per house depending on the number of houses connected to a specific transformer. Heat pumps are typically rated 3 to 6 kW and operate at a steady load for appreciable lengths of time. Consequently they should not be considered as stochastic loads. If these are installed in a high proportion of houses that previously used gas heating there is a real possibility that the local supply transformer would be overloaded. One alternative to replacing the transformers is to provide local generation. An obvious candidate for this is local combined heat and power units (CHP) as these are likely to be required to run at the same times of the year as the heat pumps. This paper examines the running characteristics of the two heating systems and looks at the running restrictions that would be required to produce complementary operation. The reduction in CO2 emissions of the resulting network will be compared with those produced by a similar sized network of houses using condensing boilers.,True,Mf5vQ-wAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,6,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161911237.pdf,6774997781313605608,/scholar?cites=6774997781313605608,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161911237.pdf,0,0,0

However. finding alternatives to many industrial energy requirements remains a challenge. Many processes in the food sector require heat at relatively low temperatures (i.e. 80°C to 200°C). High temperature heat pumps under development present a heat source that is efficient (especially if coupled with waste heat sources) and low carbon (especially if powered by decarbonised electricity). This study analysed their potential in the UK Dairy sub-sector and extrapolates this to the wider Food and Drink sector. There is potential to save approximately 164 kt-CO2/yr in the modelled processes. Applied to similar processes across the Food and Drink sector. there is scope to save 2.6 Mt-CO2/yr with projected 2030 grid electricity emissions factors.

G Cooper and G Hammond and M McManus,,,,,,This work considers the potential impact of participating in demand side management on the performance of air source heat pumps and micro-cogenerators. As significant consumers and generators of electricity at the distribution level. large numbers of heat pumps and microcogenerators would provide considerable scope for participation in demand-side management systems. However. it is possible that operating regimes which are optimised for grid considerations will not achieve the maximum performance that is possible from these units.Modelling has been conducted to investigate the significance of this effect. considering the case where local distribution constraints are the main driver for demand side interventions. A model of domestic electrical demand has been adapted to consider a neighbourhood of 128 dwellings in order to identify when interventions are necessary. This has been combined with dynamic models of two micro-cogenerators (derived by IEA ECBCS Annex 42 and based on Stirling engine and internal combustion engine prime movers) and a similar model of an air source heat pump. A simple thermal model of each building is combined with a range of user preferences in order to determine the preferred operating profiles of the heating units.,True,Mf5vQ-wAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,4,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/237449802.pdf,8044548354675320880,/scholar?cites=8044548354675320880,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/237449802.pdf,0,0,0

Exergy analysis has previously been applied at the economy level in order to provide a measure of the scope for efficiency improvement. While this approach can help to guide progress. meaningful analysis that takes full advantage of the insights of exergy. at this scale. retains some challenges. This study explores three relevant considerations to the interpretation and use of exergetic improvement potential applied at the macro (economy) scale. Specifically: (i) the nature of the relationship between improvement potential and the changes in efficiency that occur. (ii) the relative significance of exergy embodied in flows and (iii) the sensitivity of efficiency calculations to the definition of systems outputs.

This study compares the two approaches with the objective of understanding their relative merits and the conditions for which each approach is appropriate. The approaches often provide contrasting results. This can be due to differing datasets and assumptions but may also reflect underlying differences in what the results represent. In particular the applicability. implications and the boundaries to which the results relate. If the nature of these differences is not appreciated. they can be problematic for the appropriate use of the results. Several hybrid techniques have been developed in order to address these differences and take advantage of the benefits offered by each approach. These clearly have merit. However. it is proposed that where the nature of the differences is appreciated. the different results can complement each other and provide a more expansive understanding of the impacts being investigated. This can be advantageous when the results are used to inform policy decisions or to report progress towards particular goals. To explore this further. a case study relating to the UK steel sector is presented. illustrating the range of results which may be indicated by each approach.

University of Burdwan,Small Manufacturing Enterprises (SMEs) in an overpopulated developing economy serve the dual role of job-creation and shifting the occupational structure. However. their contribution to the overall health of the economy are being questioned on grounds of low productivity and economic viability. Sustainability of SMEs is argued to depend on improving labour productivity (LP) through technological upgradation. In a developing economy this may be a costly proposition due to capital scarcity. So. the effect of technological changes on productivity levels has to be estimated before taking such policies. This effect is generally measured by Total Factor Productivity Growth (TFPG) which is also a measure of Technological Progress (TP). A positive TFPG implies outward expansion of the production frontier leading to more than proportionate output growth compared to input growth whereby it may be concluded that TP is leading to productivity rise. However. TFPG in the growth accounting approach is a residual measure and encompasses the effect of not only TP. but is a combination of improved technology and the skill with which known technology is applied. i.e. Technological Diffusion or Technological Efficiency (TE). The SMEs rely on indigenous resources. adaptive technology. 'on-job' skill acquisition. and. go on experimenting till they achieve the optimum mix of technology. resource. skill and organisation. Consequently. technological diffusion is more important to them rather than the 'modernity' of the technology itself.

1301012,Infrastructural facilities in India: district level availability index,2003,Rajarshi Majumder,35,Indian Journal of Regional Science,2,,,The role of infrastructure in fostering economic growth and enhancing public welfare is more pronounced in developing economies like India. At the time of our independence. the national government was unanimous in accepting that a much wider base of infrastructure was the ‘sine qua non’ of economic development of this country. The complete consensus obviated the need for any debate on this issue and it was taken for granted that infrastructure sector needed both large scale action and outlay. There has been a remarkable growth in the absolute level of such facilities. as well as in the level relative to the size of the nation and population. i.e. in standardized forms. though the performance in terms of efficiency. quality and financial viability has remained circumspect. if not poor. However. a major aspect of this issue has been the wide regional variation in the availability of infrastructural facilities. This has often accentuated regional disparities in socio-economic development and stressed the necessity for an integrated regional development programme. The first step towards this direction is taking a stock of the regional distribution of infrastructural facilities in India. In this paper an attempt has been made towards this direction. It has been observed that there exists considerable regional disparity in infrastructural facilities in India. not only among the states. but within states also. It is also noted that the relative hierarchy has remained quite sticky over time.

A regional dimension is also explored to examine whether patterns are similar or otherwise across the country. Results indicate strong intergenerational stickiness in both educational achievement and occupational distribution among the backward social groups.

In developing countries. labour market deformities may push people into the service economy out of distress. This paper examines the tertiarisation process in the Indian labour market to identify the reasons behind such trends and the likely impact of such movements. It is observed that the employment growth in the tertiary sector had been dynamic and growth-induced during the 1980s. but in recent times has become distress-driven. Sub-sectors within the tertiary sector are behaving differently. indicating the heterogeneity of this sector. Policymakers should note these issues and take appropriate steps not only to boost high-end jobs but also to improve productivity and returns in low-end jobs. Only then will a tertiary sector revolution in India be beneficial to the workers en masse and be sustainable.,True,WzRqFU0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,11,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13547860802364729,4178908383738024923,/scholar?cites=4178908383738024923,,,,0,0,0
1301023,Earning differentials across social groups: Evidences from India,2007,Rajarshi Majumder,50,,,,,Earning differentials in labour market leads to multidimensional aspects of deprivation and disadvantage. While the ‘deprived’ are excluded from participation in society. such exclusion may also cause deprivation. In economic terms. disparity in labour markets has far-reaching consequences because of its impact on earnings and asset creation. In this paper we look at earnings differentials across social groups in the Indian Wage Labour Market. The results indicate that the share of the Excluded Groups - SCs. STs. and OBCs - in Wage Employment is lower than their corresponding share in population and their shares in Wage Earnings are even lower. Earning ratios has been continuously declining. most sharply in the 2000-05 period. The share of these Excluded Groups in the Top Wage classes is also negligible. with most of them concentrated in the Bottom Wage class. Upward mobility from lower to higher wage classes is low for these groups compared to others. thereby increasing the disparity between the groups. Skewed Occupational Distribution and predominance of Casual workers among the excluded groups are major reasons for such disparity. Earning differential is pronounced both in the economically lagging and advanced states and a rise in disparities in the post-reform period indicates that high growth-high private investment-tertiary sector boom is creating new divide in the society in terms of deprivation and discrimination. As discrimination leads to disparities in capability formation and ownership of assets. the excluded groups are unable to participate in the growing economic affluence and are being increasingly marginalized …,True,WzRqFU0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,11,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/id/eprint/12811,14349085793840508641,/scholar?cites=14349085793840508641,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/12811/1/MPRA_paper_12811.pdf,0,0,0

Whether this happens depends on the level of penetration of the ‘Knowledge Economy’ (KE). its linkage with other sectors. the nature of the jobs created. and whether different stratum of society benefit from it equally.

Technological Progress and Regional Comparative Advantage: A Study of Organised Manufacturing Sector in India,2007,Dipa Mukherjee and Rajarshi Majumder,14,Asia Pacific Development Journal (a publication of UN-ESCAP),2,,,Technological upgrading and increases in capital intensity have been championed in the organized manufacturing sector in India on the grounds that such measures improve productivity. efficiency and competitiveness. In a developing economy. these are costly propositions. Also. the effect of technological changes on productivity and efficiency levels must be estimated before implementing such policies. This paper seeks to estimate trends in factor productivity. technological progress and technological efficiency in the manufacturing sector in India and examines the relative importance of each component. It is observed that technical efficiency was moderate in the period studied. showing declines in the 1990s. Substantial disparity exists among regions and product groups regarding efficiency. technological progress and efficiency changes. It is found that increasing capital intensity was associated with falling productivity. efficiency and technological deceleration in the 1990s. Wider diffusion of technology. rather than greater capital use. is thus recommended for increasing productivity.

1301027,Wages and Employment in the Liberalised Regime: A Study of Indian Manufacturing Sector,2006,Rajarshi Majumder,49,Indian Journal of labour Economics,4,,Springer India,Expansion of earning opportunities and increment in earning levels are dual objectives of policymakers in developing countries. The structural adjustment programme in India tried to ensure both through higher growth targets. and manufacturing sector has seen the most sweeping changes. It is now being suggested that the current jobless growth is due to high wages. The present paper examines the veracity of this by examining the trends in employment and earnings in this sector over the nineties and analysing the factors affecting them. Most of the employment expansion has been in the unorganised sector where wages have stagnated. Though real wages in the factories have declined employment therein has not increased. Interestingly. both wages and employment have increased in the mid-sized units. The relationship is therefore neither unidirectional nor exhaustive. Proper mix of labour flexibility. resource availability. and scale economies would bring dynamism to the sector and increase both employment and earnings.,True,WzRqFU0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,8,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/id/eprint/4851,7718491964013090233,/scholar?cites=7718491964013090233,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/4851/1/MPRA_paper_4851.pdf,0,0,0

They are deprived of basic education and therefore become bonded to the low-skill–low-wage trap that their parents are currently in. Proper understanding of the magnitude and severity of the problem and suggesting innovative policies for breaking this vicious cycle is of utmost importance. Using findings from a Field Survey in Brick Kilns of Bardhaman district of West Bengal. this paper attempts to explore issues related to parental migration and condition of the children. The socio-economic condition of the migrant workers and their children in the kilns. the problems faced by these migrant children in accessing educational facilities. and the incidence of child labour have been explored. Effectiveness of policies taken by Sarva Shikhsa Abhiyan in ensuring education of these migrant children has also been examined. Children are observed to be growing up as replica of their parents and are inducted into the same low-skill profession from an early age. Contrary to neo-classical argument that labour migration in response to market forces will lead to equalisation of factor prices. no such trends are visible. Intervention programmes like mobile & residential schools are necessary to ensure not only basic learning of the children but also to teach them basic hygiene and livelihood techniques.

Mangrove provides rich-carbon stock. most carbon-rich forest among ecosystems of tropical forest. It is very important for the country to have a large mangrove area in the context of global community of climate change policy related to emission trading in the Kyoto Protocol. Estimation of mangrove carbon-stock using remote sensing data plays an important role in emission trading in the future. Estimation models of above ground mangrove biomass are still limited and based on common forest biomass estimation models that already have been developed. Vegetation indices are commonly used in the biomass estimation models. but they have low correlation results according to several studies. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with capability in detecting volume scattering has potential applications for biomass estimation with better correlation. This paper describes a new model which was developed using a combination of optical and SAR data. Biomass is volume dimension related to canopy and height of the trees. Vegetation indices could provide two dimensional information on biomass by recording the vegetation canopy density and could be well estimated using optical remote sensing data. One more dimension to be 3 dimensional feature is height of three which could be provided from SAR data.

This paper applied quick-mangrove-damage-detection technique using Landsat 8. The purpose of this study is to develop mangrove damage identification algorithm using Landsat 8. The findings from field survey in Segara Anakan-Cilacap show that major mangrove logging generates the growth of minor mangrove. specifically Derris and Acanthus type; the minor mangrove cover area is categorized as high density based on NDVI value. The index use does not meet the actual condition in the field. This study proposes a new index as mangrove quality indicator. The new proposed mangrove index is derived from 2 bands that could differentiate mangrove vegetation where different digital number of two bands is higher from mangrove forest than non-mangrove forest. That phenomenon is caused the low of SWIR spectral on mangrove forest due to absorption by wet soil below the mangrove forest where flooded in high tide. The new mangrove index is formulated as (NIR–SWIR/NIR x SWIR) x 10000. The new mangrove index has good correlation with density of major mangrove in the field. and also good correlation with mangrove degradation map.

1301066,Barriers to successful implementation of renewables-based rural electrification,2008,Adriana Valencia and George Caspary,7,"German Development Institute, Briefing Paper",08,,,Among the various options for off-grid rural electrification. renewables-based off-grid electrification holds particular promise due to the double dividends it offers: reduction of poverty and of greenhouse gas emissions. Notably. off-grid renewable energy systems can be suitable for applications in remote rural areas where energy consumers are dispersed and have low demand. However. these double dividends are not fully captured if productive uses of electricity are not also put in place. through additional planning and investment. Barriers to implementing renewables-based rural electrification include both entry and project continuation barriers that have so far led to project performance below expectations. The most important lessons from our barriers analysis are firstly the need for proper information about renewable energy to decision-makers. as well as about least-cost options and development-environment double dividends to be had from these technologies.

A crucial element using electrospinning on the development of these electrospun structures was to shorten the distance of from the needle tip to the collector (L). which resulted in the bond of the wet fibers deposited on the collector at the junctions. The morphologies and average pore size of electrospun structures of PVA were mainly predominated by L and the time of collecting wet fibers on the collector. In addition. experimental results showed that an increase of the PVA concentration or a decrease of the applied voltage could also diminish slightly the average pore size of electrospun productions.

Evaluation of long-term drug release from the ISD systems during the formulation development is laborious and costly. An accelerated release method that can effectively correlate the months to years of long-term release in a short time such as days or weeks is economically needed. However. no such accelerated ISD system release method has been reported in the literature to date. The objective of the current study was to develop a short-term accelerated in vitro release method for contraceptive levonorgestrel (LNG)-containing ISD systems to screen formulations for more than 3-month contraception after a single subcutaneous injection. The LNG-containing ISD formulations were prepared by using biodegradable poly (lactide-co-glycolide) and polylactic acid polymer and solvent mixtures containing N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and benzyl benzoate or triethyl citrate. Drug release studies were performed under real-time (long-term) conditions (PBS. pH 7.4. 37 C) and four accelerated (short-term) conditions:(A) PBS. pH 7.4. 50 C;(B) 25% ethanol in PBS. pH 7.4. 50 C;(C) 25% ethanol in PBS. 2% Tween 20. pH 7.4. 50 C; and (D) 25% ethanol in PBS. 2% Tween 20. pH 9. 50 C.

1301103,A synthetic system links FeFe-hydrogenases to essential E. coli sulfur metabolism,2011,Buz Barstow and Christina M Agapakis and Patrick M Boyle and Gerald Grandl and Pamela A Silver and Edwin H Wintermute,5,Journal of biological engineering,1,1-15,BioMed Central,FeFe-hydrogenases are the most active class of H2-producing enzymes known in nature and may have important applications in clean H2 energy production. Many potential uses are currently complicated by a crucial weakness: the active sites of all known FeFe-hydrogenases are irreversibly inactivated by O2. We have developed a synthetic metabolic pathway in E. coli that links FeFe-hydrogenase activity to the production of the essential amino acid cysteine. Our design includes a complementary host strain whose endogenous redox pool is insulated from the synthetic metabolic pathway. Host viability on a selective medium requires hydrogenase expression. and moderate O2 levels eliminate growth. This pathway forms the basis for a genetic selection for O2 tolerance. Genetically selected hydrogenases did not show improved stability in O2 and in many cases had lost H2 production activity.

1301104,Electrical energy storage with engineered biological systems,2019,Farshid Salimijazi and Erika Parra and Buz Barstow,13,,1,1-21,BioMed Central,The availability of renewable energy technologies is increasing dramatically across the globe thanks to their growing maturity. However. large scale electrical energy storage and retrieval will almost certainly be a required in order to raise the penetration of renewable sources into the grid. No present energy storage technology has the perfect combination of high power and energy density. low financial and environmental cost. lack of site restrictions. long cycle and calendar lifespan. easy materials availability. and fast response time. Engineered electroactive microbes could address many of the limitations of current energy storage technologies by enabling rewired carbon fixation. a process that spatially separates reactions that are normally carried out together in a photosynthetic cell and replaces the least efficient with non-biological equivalents. If successful. this could allow storage of renewable electricity through electrochemical or enzymatic fixation of carbon dioxide and subsequent storage as carbon-based energy storage molecules including hydrocarbons and non-volatile polymers at high efficiency. In this article we compile performance data on biological and non-biological component choices for rewired carbon fixation systems and identify pressing research and engineering challenges.,True,NZwbtEQAAAAJ:Vno172sVVMwC,13,https://jbioleng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13036-019-0162-7,6742609435822259248,/scholar?cites=6742609435822259248,,,https://jbioleng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13036-019-0162-7,0,0,0

We have constructed molecule to reactor models of highly engineered electromicrobial production systems that use H2 oxidation and direct electron transfer (DET). We predict electrical-to-biofuel conversion efficiency could rise to 52% with engineered in vivo CO2 fixation. H2 diffusion at ambient pressure requires areas 20 to 2.000 times the solar photovoltaic (PV) area supplying the system. Agitation can reduce this below the PV area. and the power needed is negligible when storing ≥1.1 megawatts. DET systems can be built with areas ≤ 15 times the PV area and have low energy losses even with natural conductive biofilms and can be even smaller if the conductivity could be raised to match conductive artificial polymers.

A layout with just one recuperator is used. because of the relatively low temperature of the breeding blanket coolants. The proposed cycle is able to integrate several thermal sources with different temperature ranges and includes two kinds of thermal energy storage to overcome the pulse operation: a two-tank molten salt storage and a concrete storage. The design point is obtained using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) environment. which allows to use pure substance models for CO2. helium and water. Once the design point is calculated. the sizing of pipes. heat exchangers. turbomachines and energy storage systems has been performed in order to obtain a preliminary estimation of the layout and its complexity. So. the power conversion system has been split into four equal parts in order to use commercial pipe …,True,En9pnU8AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,10,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920379618305544,8142004748700222807,/scholar?cites=8142004748700222807,,,,0,0,0

The voltage control sensitivity matrix consists of diagonal elements that relate the magnitude of each control variable to the respective controlled voltage. Analysis of the sign of these elements provides information about whether a particular control action is appropriate or not. i.e.. whether it will have the expected effect or an opposite one. The off-diagonal elements represent the interdependence between the voltage control devices. The – sensitivity matrix [] is obtained by reducing the Jacobian matrix used to solve the load-flow equations by the Newton–Raphson method.

Up to date. more than 20 peer-reviewed papers describe the use of SWAT for a variety of problems in the upper Nile basin countries. such as erosion modelling. land use and climate change impact modelling and water resources management. The majority of the studies are focused on locations in the tropical highlands in Ethiopia and around Lake Victoria. The popularity of SWAT is attributed to the fact that the tool is freely available and that it is readily applicable through the development of geographic information system (GIS) based interfaces and its easy linkage to sensitivity. calibration and uncertainty analysis tools. The online and free availability of basic GIS data that are required for SWAT made its applicability more straightforward even in data-scarce areas. However. the easy use of SWAT may not always lead to appropriate models which is also a consequence of the quality of the available free databases in these regions. In this paper. we aim at critically reviewing the use of SWAT in the context of the modelling purpose and problem descriptions in the tropical highlands of the Nile basin countries. To evaluate the models that are described in journal papers. a number of criteria are used to evaluate the model set-up. model performances. physical representation of the model parameters. and the correctness of the hydrological model balance.

This study was aimed at identifying the potential land-use drivers in the Jedeb catchment of the Abbay basin by combining statistical analysis. field investigation and remote sensing. To do so. a land-use change model was calibrated and evaluated using the SITE (SImulation of Terrestrial Environment) modelling framework. SITE is cellular automata based multi-criteria decision analysis framework for simulating land-use conversion based on socio-economic and environmental factors. Past land-use trajectories (1986–2009) were evaluated using a reference Landsat-derived map (agreement of 84%). Results show that major land-use change drivers in the study area were population. slope. livestock and distances from various infrastructures (roads. markets and water). It was also found that farmers seem to increasingly prefer plantations of trees such as Eucalyptus by replacing croplands perhaps mainly due to declining crop yield. soil fertility and climate variability. Potential future trajectory of land-use change was also predicted under a business-as-usual scenario (2009–2025). Results show that agricultural land will continue to expand from 69.5% in 2009 to 77.5% in 2025 in the catchment albeit at a declining rate when compared with the period from 1986 to 2009. Plantation forest will also increase at a much higher rate. mainly at the expense of natural vegetation. agricultural land and grasslands.

1301301,Critical review of the application of SWAT in the upper Nile Basin countries.,2012,A Van Griensven and P Ndomba and S Yalew and F Kilonzo,9,,3,,,The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a hydrological simulation tool that is widely applied within the Nile basin. Up to date. more than 20 peer reviewed papers describe the use of SWAT for a variety of problems in the upper Nile basin countries. such as erosion modeling. land use modeling. climate change impact modeling and water 5 resources management. The majority of the studies are clustered in the tropical highlands in Ethiopia and around Lake Victoria. The popularity of SWAT is attributed to the fact that the tool is freely available and that it is readily applicable through the development of Geographic Information System (GIS) based interfaces and its easy linkage to sensitivity. calibration and uncertainty analysis tools. The online and free availability of 10 basic GIS data that are required for SWAT made its applicability more straight forward even in data scarce areas. However. the easy use of SWAT may not always lead to knowledgeable models. In this paper. we aim at critically reviewing the use of SWAT in the context of the modeling purpose and problem descriptions in the tropical highlands of the Nile Basin countries. A number of criteria are used to evaluate the model set-up. 15 model performances. physical representation of the model parameters. and the correctness of the hydrological model balance.

The basin is increasingly experiencing multi-dimensional pressures including population growth. climate change and variability. deforestation. land/soil degradation. as well as increasing upstream-downstream tension on water use rights. Understanding the dynamic interactions of land use and water resources in the basin comes at the forefront of any effort to improving the livelihood and sustainability in the basin.

Proceedings of the 7th International Congress on Environmental Modelling and Software (iEMSs), June 15-19, San Diego, California, USA. ISBN: 978-88-9035-744-2",,,,Ecosystem services assessment requires an integrated approach. as it is influenced by elements such as climate. hydrology and socio-economics. which in turn influence each other. However. there are few studies that integrate these elements in order to assess ecosystem services. Absence of integrated approach to modelling hydrological and land-use changes. for instance. often oversights the dynamic feedback between the two processes. Dynamic changes in land-use should be fed into hydrological models and vice-versa at each time-step for a more realistic representation. In this study. this approach is demonstrated with a case study of the uThukela catchment. South Africa. There is an increasing pressure on grasslands in the catchment. The grassland supports livestock grazing. one of the main economic and social service for the communal farmers. High livestock population causes degradation of the grasslands. and increasing demand for agricultural lands decreases the extent of the grazing lands. In addition. this is further influenced by changes in climate. and has multiple impacts. such as increased erosion and changing flow regime. The SITE (SImulation of Terrestrial Environments) land-use change model and the SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model) hydrological model were coupled at code level to account for these processes. The two models exchange land-use maps (from SITE) and biomass production (from SWIM). SWIM was modified to produce biomass output. Grassland capacity for grazing service is determined through biomass coming from SWIM.

Within the EU funded EnviroGrids project. a detailed application of SWAT on the Black Sea Basin is envisaged using high resolution data. In order to support the computation. the model is run on a computer grid. The use of the SWAT allowed for such computations with little adaptations to the source. A 3-step procedure is needed. In the first step. a program is run in order to split the model into several sub-models. Afterwards. the sub-models are run in parallel. In a last step. the outputs of the sub-basins are collected at a central computer and the routing is performed. High computations are also needed when simulations have to be repeated. such as for sensitivity. calibration and uncertainty analysis. In these cases. the simulations are repeated for different parameter sets. In this paper. we discuss the gridification of the algorithm “LH-OAT” that performs sensitivity analysis and has been linked to the SWAT model. The results show a clear improvement in calculation time. Nevertheless. it is concluded that the parallel computing of a distributed model is mainly beneficial for large scale applications with high resolution. while running the sensitivity analysis algorithm has more general and obvious benefit. In a next step. the gridification will be optimised depending on the application and the overheads that are due to submission and receiving of files. as well as potential waiting times for executions on the grid.,True,RGINY9AAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,5,https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/iemssconference/2010/all/597/,15372193578203585424,/scholar?cites=15372193578203585424,,,https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2642&context=iemssconference,0,0,0

However. changes in land and water resources are often studied separately. A better representation of the interaction between land-use change and its drivers on the one hand and water resources on the other is imperative for sustainable environmental management. This research investigates and develops spatial analysis methods and tools for the quantification of dynamic feedbacks between land-use change and water resources. by focusing on case study catchments in Ethiopia and South Africa. Furthermore. the research investigates methods for analysing land-use suitability and modelling land-use change. Results show that major changes in land-use have been observed in the past two to three decades in the study catchments. Model representation of the interaction between land-use change and water resources shows that changes in land-use influence hydrologic responses. These influences are especially pronounced during high-and low-flow seasons. Likewise. hydrologic processes and water resources availability influence land-use suitability and hence land-use change responses.

The sophisticated spatial dynamic planning tools that have been developed in the last decades to support policy makers in the decision making process do not take into account the mutual feedbacks between land use and hydrology. In this study a framework for an integrated spatial decision support system is presented where the feedbacks between land use and hydrology are taken into account by coupling the SITE (Simulation of Terrestrial Environments) land-use model to the SWIM hydrological model. This framework enables policy makers to assess the impact of their planning scenarios on ecosystem services using a web-based tool that interactively presents trends in space and time of spatial indicators derived from both models. This approach is tested for the uThukela area. which is located along the northern areas of the Drakensberg Mountains which form the border between Lesotho and South Africa. The region is extremely important for its catchment-services as water derived from it is pumped into the Vaal River supplying water to the city of Johannesburg. Because of poor management of ecosystem services. less water is produced by the catchment more erratically. siltation levels are increasing and less carbon is retained in the soil.

A number of studies have analyzed some of these effects on energy. However. there is lack of studies with consistent data and tools for assessing climate change impacts on the the energy sector. particularly at global scale and in relation to other sectors such as agriculture and water. The lack of consistency in modeling approaches has resulted in large uncertainties in climate change impacts on potential energy production and associated sectoral competitions. This study investigates future climate change impacts on global energy production potential from hydropower. solar. wind. and biomass sources. It also investigates inter-sectoral competitions between land. water. and energy in relation to climate change.

By creation of flower strips and management of semi-natural habitats. farmers and other stakeholders in agricultural landscapes try to enhance populations of ecosystem service providers’ habitats. such as natural enemies of pests and pollinators. However. the redesign of landscapes for multiple ecosystem services needs to take the trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services and agricultural profitability into account. We used the modelling framework Landscape IMAGES to explore options for reconfiguring and managing habitats for multiple ecosystem services in the Hoeksche Waard. The Netherlands. A wide variety of alternative landscape configurations and management practices were evaluated using a Pareto-optimizing algorithm. The analysis shows that there are both trade-offs and synergies between crop production. floral resources for flying natural enemies. water quality. and the management costs allocated to different stakeholders (private and public) in the landscape. These findings can help stakeholders to make informed decisions about their management actions.,True,RGINY9AAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,0,https://www6.inrae.fr/comite_agriculture_biologique/content/download/4087/40444/version/1/file/iobc-wprs_bulletin_2017_122.pdf#page=127,,,,,https://www6.inrae.fr/comite_agriculture_biologique/content/download/4087/40444/version/1/file/iobc-wprs_bulletin_2017_122.pdf#page=127,0,0,0
1301317,A spatial planning tool for the evaluation of the effect of hydrological and land-use changes on ecosystem services,2014,Leon Mugwiza and Seleshi Yalew and Johannes van der Kwast and Masoom Hamdard and Willem van Deursen,,,,,,Many point-based models have been designed to simulate hydrology. gas flux. nutrient dynamics. and/or plant growth processes at a single point on the landscape. However. these environmental processes are known to be spatially variable. Simulations at different spatial locations therefore require adjustment of model input parameters to reflect specific conditions at each location. Increased availability of geospatial data sets. including remote sensing images. land cover maps. digital soil surveys. crop yield maps. and vehicle-based plant or soil maps. can support spatial model parameterization efforts. However. tools are needed for processing geospatial data layers and interfacing the data with the simulation model. The objective of this research was to develop software tools and data processing pipelines for managing data streams from a variety of instruments and merging site-specific information into environmental model simulations. A software'plug-in'named Geospatial Simulation has been developed for the open-source Quantum geographic information system (GIS) to accomplish required geoprocessing tasks. including processing raster and vector data layers. running simulation models with site-specific data. and optimizing model simulations to site-specific locations. The plug-in was designed to be model independent. meaning the software can interact with any point-based simulation model that uses ASCII files for input and output. Testing and refinement of these geoprocessing tools were accomplished using data from two precision irrigation experiments for surface-irrigated cotton. conducted at Maricopa.

Looking at the case of Kuwait. the authors highlight the growing potential for economic cost savings. primarily for solar photovoltaic power in the GCC states over oil-fired power generation. in the current global high-price environment for oil. The economics of solar power versus gas-fired power generation in the GCC are less obvious. though rising LNG imports by some GCC countries (chiefly Kuwait. the UAE and possibly Bahrain) are expected to improve these economics in the future. Renewable energy also entails some important caveats for the region. Highly distorted domestic energy markets that continue to price fuel at a fraction of its shadow economic cost provide few market-based incentives for utilities to switch towards renewables. The recent emphasis on the use of energy policies for renewables for the creation of ‘green’ jobs by GCC policymakers’ may increase. rather than reduce. unproductive economic sinks across the GCC states’ domestic energy industries and that would considerably dilute. if not call into question. any economic gains to be made from renewable energy in the GCC.,True,G3fCkOEAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,49,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b8c595e2-8142-43f2-a3cf-be3529617751,2943161649602427202,/scholar?cites=2943161649602427202,,,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b8c595e2-8142-43f2-a3cf-be3529617751/download_file?safe_filename=MEP-10.pdf&file_format=application%2Fpdf&type_of_work=Working+paper,0,0,0

However current methods of oxygen production are energy intensive and so reduce the efficiency and power output of the plant. A relatively new technology. which can solve this problem. involves Ion Transport Membranes (ITMs). which are permeable to oxygen and no other substance and require significantly less energy per unit of oxygen than current methods of oxygen production.Much research has been conducted on ITMs. both as oxygen producers and when used to partially oxidate methane for syngas production. However. these studies have been conducted at different temperatures and oxygen partial pressures. using membranes with different thicknesses and surface geometries. All of these factors affect the oxygen flux through the membrane.

A current proposed configuration of the cycle requires an oxygen ion transport membrane air separation unit operating at 920 °C and a separate combustion chamber operating at 1400 °C. If oxygen is consumed by a chemical reaction on the permeate side of an oxygen transport membrane. the oxygen flux is larger. so the air separation unit can be physically smaller. In addition. if this reaction is exothermic. the air separation unit is heated by the reaction. requiring no additional heating. Combustion fulfils both of these requirements. so combustion in the oxygen transport membrane air separation unit would allow a smaller air separation unit. which would also act as a combustion chamber.

The Otto cycle is to act as the topping cycle. with the Stirling cycle acting to recover heat from the exhaust for the purpose of additional power generation.The present work investigates the thermodynamic optimisation of the combined cycle system for the case of the engines operating under two imposed parametric constraints: 1) imposed heat addition to the Otto cycle. and 2) imposed maximum cycle temperature of the Otto cycle. These conditions are analogous to a specified fuel consumption of the engine and the metallurgical limit of the operating components respectively. The optimum work output for each scenario is analysed with respect to the particular physical constraints of the Stirling cycle heat exchangers–effectiveness. NTU. heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer area. Only interactions between the engine and the external source and sink are considered in this treatment.

1301340,Solar energy conversion through seaweed photosynthesis with combustion in a zero-emission power plant,2006,Evgeny Yantovski and Jim McGovern,,,,,Dublin Institute of Technology,A proposed ‘closed cycle’power plant scheme. referred to as SOFT (Solar Oxygen Fuel Turbine). is described. The scheme involves the cultivation of macroalgae in a pond. combustion of their organic matter in a fluidised bed boiler that generates steam for a Rankine cycle steam power plant and the return of the combustion products to the pond to feed the algae. Oxygen. equivalent to that used for combustion. is re-released to the atmosphere by photosynthesis. while the carbon dioxide that is produced by combustion is absorbed by photosynthesis and thereby recycled. It is proposed that the seaweed Ulva. which is common in Irish coastal waters. can be used in the solar pond. The solar energy conversion efficiency is less than that which can be achieved by the use of photovoltaic panels. but the energy expenditure to construct algae ponds as solar energy receivers is much less. Therefore the proposed scheme can be economically. as well as environmentally. attractive. For a power unit of 100 kW the pond surface area in Ireland would be about 6 hectares.,True,K8nEnJgAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,4,https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AV20120165185,9800090220679233167,/scholar?cites=9800090220679233167,,,,0,0,0

The need for the virtual system is outlined and the concept is demonstrated by applying it to a CHP steam cycle. The FCS concept allows the physical constraints on the exergy interactions associated with flow streams to be taken into account fully. It also simplifies the treatment of bifurcations in material flows and considerably reduces the need for absolute exergy evaluations. The new concept follows from the work already published by the authors on conceptual devices for exergy analysis and builds on this and the work of other authors relating to exergy and exergoeconomic analysis. especially using matrix methods.

A theoretical Stirling cycle engine model is developed. Using a theoretical decoupled engine configuration in which working space swept volume. volume variation. phase angle and dead space ratio are controlled via a black-box electronic controller. a model is developed that is to be used as a tool for analysis of the ideal Stirling cycle engine and the limits on its real world realisation. The theoretical configuration approximates the five–space configuration common in Stirling cycle analysis. It comprises two working spaces and three heat exchangers: hot side. cold side and the regenerator between. The kinematic crank mechanism is replaced with an electronically controlled motor/generator system. with one motor/generator controlling each of the working pistons. Use of stop valves permits flow and non-flow processes inherent in the ideal cycle to be realised.

Conf. on Design and Operation of Container Ships (RINA),,,,As modern container carriers become larger. certain parts of the existing prescriptive rules may pose increased uncertainty due to a lack of service experience. For example. questions concerning the envelope of wave-induced saghog moments may be raised as to whether the nonlinear effects due to the hull form or forward speed are properly reflected. The direct calculation methods are often used by ship designers to apply the ship motion and sea loads calculated from nonlinear seakeeping theory. then the finite element structural analysis is carried out to assess the structural integrity of the vessel. Although many advances have been made in the nonlinear hydrodynamic tools used for design reviews of the large container carriers. systematic validation of the wave loads and structural performance of these vessels in real operational conditions have not been reported.A comprehensive full-scale measurement system was developed to measure the wave environment. ship motions and structural loads. The complete system consists of the hull stress monitoring system. onboard wave monitoring system and voyage optimization system. The hull stress monitoring system employs ten long base strain gauges to measure the hull girder bending moments and torsional moment.

1301358,Simulation and evaluation of environmental aspects throughout the design process,1998,JP den Hartog and A Koutamanis and PG Luscuere,,,,,CUMINCAD,The evaluation of environmental aspects in architectural design has traditionally been performed by means of simple (and often simplistic) rule systems. These generally remain at the normative level of minimal control one encounters in building rules and regulations. thereby failing to provide sufficient information and clarity for design guidance. Despite this. evaluation results normally bound subsequent design decisions as fundamental. inflexible constraints. At much later design stages. when architectural form has been largely crystallized and when environmental subsystems must be specified in detail. both the architect and the contributing engineers often realize the severe limitation of the initial choices. A frequently voiced argument for such simplification in the guise of abstraction is the lack of detailed information on the form and functional content of a building in the early stages of the design process. This obviously presupposes a tabula rasa generative approach. The application of a priori knowledge in the form of types. cases. precedents and automated recognition permits direct transaction from the abstract to the specific at and between a number of predefined relevant abstraction levels in the representation. The combination of a priori knowledge at the typological level with multilevel representations permits the use of precise simulation techniques already in the early design stages and throughout the design process. The simulation results employ the dual representation principle of scientific visualization. thereby linking form with measurable performance.

1301360,Circular and flexible infill concepts: Integration of the residential user perspective,2019,Bob Geldermans and Martin Tenpierik and Peter Luscuere,11,Sustainability,1,261,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Circular building has gained considerable attention in the Netherlands during the past decade. It is rooted in concepts such as circular economy (CE) and Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C®). accentuating the closing and coupling of material loops to establish effective and efficient resource flows. Moreover. those concepts adhere to a systemic. holistic worldview. incorporating multiple flows and values. Although social aspects. such as health. wellbeing. and social inclusiveness. are generally part of circular building principles. specific benefits for end-users are not. This paper explores the synergistic potential of circular and flexible (Circ-Flex) criteria from the perspective of enhanced control and convenience for residents. The hypothesis is that without integrating the user domain. replicability of circular building concepts on a larger residential scale cannot be done in a truly sustainable manner. The paper is structured around two objectives:(1) further identifying the relationship between flexible and circular building; and (2) exploring the impact of circular. flexible building concepts and practices for the users of multi-family housing. specifically regarding interior partitioning. The research follows a mixed-mode methodology comprising of literature review. case study. expert consultations and a quick-scan assessment. Eleven Circ-Flex criteria are explored. grouped in three categories: flexibility capacity. circularity capacity. and user capacity. These criteria are applied to two partitioning variants. whilst exploring the performance regarding material circulation and user benefits.

1301364,Airconditioning in nursing homes till death do us part,2002,PG Luscuere and V Borst,1,Proceedings of Indoor Air Õ02,,1032-1037,,Heat wave periods coincide with raised levels of mortality in general and particularly among in-patients in nursing homes. There are several studies which confirm this phenomenon. among them one in The Netherlands (Borst. Schols and Mackenbach. 1997; also Mackenbach. Schols and Borst. 1997). This study showed the correlation between mortality rates and the weekly average of maximum daily ambient air temperatures at intervals of 5 ºC. As mortality rates were more evidently raised in hot periods the correlation with specifically the hot period (summer 1994) was analysed in more detail. The correlation is striking. with a correlation factor of R2= 0.8988. This result generates the question as to what extent nursing homes should be equipped with air-conditioning even in moderate climates. and provides a start towards a quantification of indoor temperature limits in heat wave periods.,True,vF8cXvsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,6,"http://www.inspiredambitions.nl/sites/default/files/Airconditioning%20in%20nursing%20homes,%20till%20death%20do%20us%20part.pdf",4867349928424919151,/scholar?cites=4867349928424919151,,,"http://www.inspiredambitions.nl/sites/default/files/Airconditioning%20in%20nursing%20homes,%20till%20death%20do%20us%20part.pdf",0,0,0

The general research objective is to determine assessment criteria for the performance of indoor partitioning products in a circular model. The overarching aim is to establish a more integrated and inclusive approach to the transition from linear to circular built environments. This ties in with recent calls for a more comprehensive evidence-base to better inform the policy debate. in the light of interrelated Sustainable Development Goals. The paper emphasises the operational level. looking closer at the actual performance of circular economy implementation. providing more grip on performance indicators of infill components in circular applications. specifically partition walls. Next to partitioning one can think of other components in the infill domain. such as kitchens. bathrooms and mechanical. electrical. plumbing installations. After a brief background sketch. a literature review is reported regarding indoor environmental quality and indoor air quality in general and the linkage with circular and flexible building (products) in particular. Next. an analysis is made of three assessment schemes that address the operational level. Subsequently. several criteria are synthesized and tested. It was shown that the assessment schemes have overlapping and complementary features that. in unison. provide a solid basis for an integrated assessment of circularity potential and health impact of infill products.

Although the higher charging voltage can shorten the charging time. it is limited in order to avoid thermal instability. In the present research. the charging time has shortened using a higher charging voltage while the stability of the system has remained the same through thermal stability analysis.

This study mainly discusses the enhancing effects of cobalt oxide (CoOx) on the photocurrent of gallium nitride (GaN) photoelectrodes in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system for hydrogen generation. The CoOx nanofilm is formed on a GaN epitaxial layer through the thermal evaporation and post-deposition thermal annealing of cobalt metal. The X-ray photoemission spectroscopy spectra confirm that the exposed metal ions in the as-deposited films are Co3+ and Co2+. The chemical composition of the annealed CoOx films is more biased toward Co3+ than that of as-deposited films. This finding indicates that it is suitable for water oxidation during a PEC reaction for water splitting because the films may contain more CoOOH.

NiOx nanoparticles avoid corrosion on the n-GaN surface. decrease the solar water-splitting reaction overpotential. and enhance the photocurrent density at a working electrode applied bias of 1 V in the two-electrode system. Finally. in the stability test. the hydrogen evolution rate of NiOx (3:2) is more effective than that of pristine n-GaN even after 5 h.

However. the descriptions of testicular dysfunction and behavioral deficits leading to complete infertility in male mice lacking estrogen receptor α (ERα) have indicated the importance of estrogen action in fertility of the male rodent. In contrast. male mice lacking the newly discovered estrogen receptor β (ERβ) exhibit no compromised fertility. Recently. elaborate sperm transplantation studies have shown that the altered sperm function characteristic of the ERα knockout male are the result of the loss of ERα actions in the supporting somatic cells of the testis and epididymis rather than in the germ cell. This brief review will discuss the roles of estrogen action in male reproduction as revealed by mice lacking both known forms of the ER.

The study has explored the possibility of using TiO2 as anode material for ARSBs in presence of 5 M NaOH aqueous electrolyte. CV profiles show that anatase TiO2 exhibits reversible sodium ion insertion/de-insertion reactions. CV studies of TiO2 anode in aqueous sodium electrolytes at different scan rate shows that the Na+ ion insertion reaction at the electrode is diffusion controlled with a resistive behavior. Proton insertion from aqueous sodium electrolytes into TiO2 cannot be ruled out. To confirm the ion inserted and de-inserted. CV studies are done at different concentration of NaOH and it is found that at lower concentrations of NaOH. proton insertion process competes with Na+ ion insertion process and as the concentration increases. the Na+ ion insertion process becomes the predominant electrode reaction making it suitable anode materials for aqueous sodium batteries in 5 M NaOH.,True,rY_WHmIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kadiyala_Chandra_Babu_Naidu/publication/340732732_Electrochemical_study_of_anatase_TiO_2_in_aqueous_sodium-ion_electrolytes/links/5e9aea73a6fdcca78921386d/Electrochemical-study-of-anatase-TiO-2-in-aqueous-sodium-ion-electrolytes.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kadiyala_Chandra_Babu_Naidu/publication/340732732_Electrochemical_study_of_anatase_TiO_2_in_aqueous_sodium-ion_electrolytes/links/5e9aea73a6fdcca78921386d/Electrochemical-study-of-anatase-TiO-2-in-aqueous-sodium-ion-electrolytes.pdf,0,0,0
1301450,Superadiabatic combustion in conducting tubes and heat exchangers of finite length,2007,Ingmar Schoegl and Janet L Ellzey,151,Combustion and Flame,1-2,142-159,Elsevier,Classic theories of combustion rely upon the principle that the maximum temperature attainable in a reaction is predicted by the adiabatic equilibrium temperature. In certain burner configurations. however. the maximum temperature may locally exceed this value by a significant amount due to heat recirculation. which has led to the concept of superadiabatic combustion. A striking aspect of this type of combustion is a broadening of the limits of flammability due to the accelerating effect of temperature increases on chemical reaction rates. In this paper. a simple analytical model is developed to study the superadiabatic performance of a combustor consisting of two parallel channels of finite length that are divided by a conducting wall. Assuming equal flow rates in the individual channels. the co-flow configuration is equivalent to combustion in conducting tubes. whereas the counterflow configuration is conceptually …,True,f4CSYVMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,62,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010218007001083,4757461195960209547,/scholar?cites=4757461195960209547,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ingmar_Schoegl/publication/245157855_Superadiabatic_combustion_in_conducting_tubes_and_heat_exchangers_of_finite_length/links/5b4978920f7e9b4637d5f07a/Superadiabatic-combustion-in-conducting-tubes-and-heat-exchangers-of-finite-length.pdf,0,0,0

Hydrocarbon fuels offer high power densities and can be reformed into a hydrogen-rich syngas. which. once purified. can be used to power hydrogen operated fuel cells. In this paper. we present experimental results for a novel non-catalytic mesoscale fuel reformer concept. which is based on heat recirculation between parallel channels with opposing flow directions.

Flat flame burners stabilize planar premixed flames downstream of a porous plug. Within this study. the porous plug is modeled as a thermally conducting. optically thick medium. allowing for both conductive and radiative heat transfer. Based on the simplified model. the impact of radiative heat exchange between the porous plug exit and the downstream environment is investigated. In “surface” combustion. flame stabilization occurs due to heat transfer between gas phase and porous solid. Results demonstrate that radiative heat transfer from a hot downstream environment to the porous plug significantly increases maximum attainable mass fluxes.

Based on an eigenanalysis of chemical sources terms. chemical source modes and associated reaction modes are distinguished. The dominant mode amplitude is used to determine whether source terms within the flame structure are promoting or counteracting the dominant chemical source mode. Mode sources are then defined from source terms to further differentiate dominant sources (ie species or temperature) that promote or counteract a chemical source mode. Similarly. mode participation distinguishes promoting reactions from counteracting ones.

The existing main waste management strategy of New Zealand is to reduce. reuse and recycle waste. Most of the remaining waste is currently disposed of in landfills. WtE options were explored in this study as a more sustainable waste treatment alternative in the country. while making use of the annual 30.8 petajoule of available waste energy in New Zealand. Four WtE technology options were discussed and compared. namely incineration. anaerobic digestion. gasification and pyrolysis. The aspects in comparison were air pollution. cost. side products. capacity. commercial maturity. energy efficiency and type of waste treated. Special emphasis was given to environment-friendliness and cost. From the comparison. it was found that anaerobic digestion seems to be the most attractive solution for the country as it is environment-friendly. economical and the concept is consistent with New Zealand’s existing waste management strategy. The major limitations of anaerobic digestion are its low energy production efficiency and its limited waste treatment capacity. Hence. an effective national waste reduction and recycling strategy is crucial for the success of this waste management option.

1301487,Energy saving measures for automotive air conditioning (AC) system in the tropics,2014,Alison Subiantoro and Kim Tiow Ooi and Ulrich Stimming,,,,2116:1-8,http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2360&context=iracc,Air conditioning (AC) is an integral component of modern cars in the tropics. However. AC usage in this region consumes a large amount of energy. In conventional internal combustion engine cars. it consumes up to 30% of the fuel. while in battery electric cars. AC may reduce the battery range by up to 40%. Fortunately. there are various ways to improve the efficiency of automotive ACs in the tropics. In this paper. three energy saving measures are discussed. These include a higher indoor temperature setting. a smaller temperature lift and a separate dehumidification system. The study suggests that increasing the indoor temperature setting alone from 20 C to 24 C can save about 22% of the compressor power and increase the COP by up to 13%. Reducing the temperature lift by reducing the temperature difference between the condensing and ambient temperatures can potentially save up to 30% of the compressor power and increase the COP by 45%. An important requirement of this method is the need for a compact and lightweight heat exchanger design. The separation of dehumidification and cooling is very effective as it reduces the thermal load and allows for a higher evaporating temperature.

The hybrid dehumidifier–AC concept was studied here to improve the energy efficiency of such systems. Feasibility of the concept was investigated by looking at the design complexity. expected performance. and economic aspects. From the design analysis. it was concluded that small desiccant wheels are most practical for portable and window ACs. while no dehumidification concept was found ideal for split-type room ACs. Performance of the system was benchmarked with data from a 6.4 m2 room under tropical ambient conditions with air change rates of 1–4 changes per hour.

The engine had a swept volume of 30 cm3. At the benchmark conditions. the suction pressure was 8 bar. the discharge pressure was 1 bar. and the operating speed was 3.000 rev·min−1. It was found that the engine had a second-law efficiency of 29.6% at the benchmark conditions. The contributors of exergy loss were friction (49%). throttling (38%). heat transfer (12%). and fluid mixing (1%). A parametric study was also conducted. The parameters to be examined were suction reservoir pressure (4 to 12 bar). operating speed (2.400 to 3.600 rev·min−1). and rotational cylinder inertia (0.94 to 2.81 g·mm2). The study found that a higher suction reservoir pressure initially increased the second-law efficiency but then plateaued at about 30%.

When used as an expander. a mechanism to determine the timing of the suction process in RV machine is required. In this study. a blocker-type valve is proposed for the suction control. and a simulation is carried out to investigate its friction and leakage characteristics. The valve comprises a stationary blocker that blocks high-pressure working fluid from entering the working chambers during expansion. In order to reduce friction. there should be a clearance between the rotary parts and the stationary blocker. which inevitably causes leakage of the working fluid into the working chambers.

With this potential. the government has the ambitious target to generate as much as 7 GWe of electricity in 2025 from geothermal energy. However. the installed capacity of geothermal power plant in Indonesia until 2019 is only 1.9 GWe. Enhancements in already-installed geothermal power plants with a binary power plant can be considered to achieve the 2025 target. In this research. a thermo-economic analysis is carried out to assess the feasibility of binary power systems to enhance the existing geothermal power plants in Indonesia. The Wayang Windu site is selected as the case study. Three working fluids. ie. n-Pentane. isopentane. and R245fa. are compared. Two different optimization objectives are considered and compared. First. the thermal efficiency is optimized to maximize the thermodynamic performance. In the second scenario. the heat exchanger area is optimized to maximize the economic performance. Analysis of the economic profitability variables. namely the payback period and internal rate of return. shows that optimizing the heat exchangers gives better economic results when compared to optimizing the thermal efficiency. The results also show that the type of working fluid significantly affects both the thermal efficiency and economic profitability of the binary power plant. Moreover. n-Pentane has the most preferred thermo-economic performance for the geothermal conditions at Wayang Windu with the smallest payback period of 13 years and the highest internal rate of return of 11.28%.

Though it is a mature technology. the selection. sizing and optimisation of the expander used to extract energy is still an active topic of research since it can strongly affect the performance of the ORC. Among the types of volumetric expanders. the use of rotary vane expanders is advantageous. particularly in small-scale applications. due to their simplicity. low manufacturing and maintenance cost. low noise. and high volumetric expansion ratios. However. they generally perform poorly in comparison to other rotary machines because of their inevitable leakage and friction losses. leading to low efficiencies. A Revolving Vane (RV) expander. in which both the rotor and cylinder rotate. unlike conventional vane-type mechanisms. has been shown to exhibit a significant reduction in friction losses. Such a machine has been previously studied in compressed air and refrigeration systems. but not in an ORC system.In this study. the first law of thermodynamics is used to evaluate the performance of a Revolving Vane expander within an ORC system using R134a.

Therefore. it is imperative that they are closely monitored and controlled during mill operation to keep their levels within a predetermined safe and efficient operating range regardless of the rate at which the raw coal is fed to the mill. One way to achieve this is through a control schedule that compares the value obtained from the process to the stored set-point value to determine if there is any deviation that requires correction. This paper describes a steady state model that could be used alongside conventional controllers as an on-line shadow that provides inferential estimates of desired temperatures and pressure drops in the mill circuit which can be continuously compared with the actual values for adjustment.

Rice husks fibre reinforced polypropylene composite is ecofriendly. affordable and it is commonly used for light load structural and non structural components as well as structures. When fractured by rapidly or gradually applied loads. the rice husks fibre reinforced polypropylene composite cannot be economically repaired using traditional repair methods such as patch. bolted or scarf repair which would be applicable for leaf based as well as seed hair based fibre reinforced polymer composites. In this research. repair by refilling the damaged volume by injection of healing agents has been investigated. The repair helps in recovering part of initial impact strength lost during destructive testing. The composite test pieces were produced by injection moulding. cooled and tested for impact strengths. Impact strength values for pristine test pieces were a maximum of 61 J/mm2. The destroyed test pieces had their fractured surfaces healed by injecting various healing agents and retesting the samples destructively after healing. The impact strengths for healed test pieces were recorded and compared with those of pristine test pieces. The recovered impact maximum strength after healing and retest reached 60 J/mm2 translating to 98.36% of the initial impact strength.

Venugopal,199,Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,,282-291,Elsevier,A reaction mechanism has been elucidated on Ag and/or Cu supported on mixed phase (anatase/rutile) of TiO2 and the H2 evolution rates are rationalized by physicochemical characteristics of the fresh and used catalysts by XRD. XPS. TEM and ESR analyses. In situ reduction of Ag-Cu/TiO2 catalyst is monitored by UV-DR spectral studies under natural and artificial light during H2O splitting. The H2-TPR analysis emphasized an interaction between reducible mixed oxides of Ag-Cu particles. Addition of Ag dramatically decreased the band gap of Cu/TiO2 and increased the absorption in the visible light region. The synergism between Ag and Cu nanoparticles generated additional active sites for enhanced H2 yields. A strong interaction between Ag and Cu leads to metal sites (Ag.

Among these alternatives. hydrogen has a life changing opportunity for the human being for the future. The chemical energy stored in hydrogen can be converted into electricity via various types of fuel cells. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell is the most promising type providing high power densities at operating temperatures typically less than 100 °C. The necessity of increasing the platinum utilization in PEMFCs. due to its cost and availability. requires an optimization of the catalyst support and the gas diffusion layers. In many long term fuel cell tests. a decrease in water removal capacity leads to a gradual decrease of the PEMFC performance. The use of more graphitic and highly oriented carbon as an alternative material for use in the gas diffusion media combines a high electronic conductivity with an acceptable surface area. One approach. introduced in this thesis. is the direct growth of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) on a gas diffusion layer providing a strong network with a high surface area.

Potential renewable alternatives of MTBE are tert-butyl ethers of glycerol (GTBE). produced by the etherification of glycerol with isobutene on similar resins [2. 3]. Di-and tri-GTBE are the desired higher ethers because of their better fuel blending properties. Performance of several macroporous cation exchange resins have been reported for GTBE production. revealing the dependence of higher ether selectivity on acid capacity [4. 5]. However. the effect of acid strength on catalytic performance has here-to-fore not been elucidated. Temperature programmed desorption measurements to determine the acid strength are not applicable to resin catalysts because of their poor thermal stability. Here. thus. we have developed a spectroscopy-based methodology to quantify the acid strength of Amberlyst 15TM and its Na+-exchanged counterparts with different acid capacities. Relative acid strength of each catalyst was correlated with selectivity for glycerol etherification with isobutene.,True,TvX4HnYAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2017/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper16047/ODB-NAM%202017%20Abstract-270317-revised.pdf,,,,,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2017/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper16047/ODB-NAM%202017%20Abstract-270317-revised.pdf,0,0,0

Carbon nano fibers (CNFs) are attractive support materials for FCs since these materials provide high electrochemically stable electrodes and effective catalyst utilization due to the high accessible surface area. The growth of CNFs was achieved on silica. alumina. carbon. and silicon in different growth conditions. such as different temperature and carbon source. Growth of CNFs on a carbon electrode has been rarely examined so far in the literature. In the present study. the growth of CNFs on two different graphite surfaces. carbon papers and graphite disks. is investigated to produce advanced electrodes for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. On the graphite disks. the growth is rather random and mainly CNFs having diameters of 30-50 nm dominate on the surface. Nanoparticle dipping method and homogenous deposition precipitation methods are applied to investigate different deposition effects on CNF growth and morphology. One side growth of CNF on carbon paper is achieved by using a homogenous deposition precipitation of nickel with masking. The main factors that can affect the substrate selection and desired deposition method of nickel are determined as nickel loading. porosity changes of carbon paper. and the Pt loading difficulties for specific substrates.,True,TvX4HnYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/carbon-nanofiber-growth-on-graphite-disks-and-paper-for-pem-fuel-,,,,,,0,0,0

Analysis has shown that neglecting diffusion in longitudinal direction (often justified by large Peclet number) may lead to underestimation of evaporative mass losses from porous surfaces. Considering diffusion only from individual pores across a constant boundary layer accounts for most of the evaporation rates predicted by the full advection‐diffusion equation (ADE).

1301591,Evaporation from porous surfaces into turbulent airflows,2015,Erfan Haghighi,,,,,,Evaporation from porous media is a ubiquitous process appearing in many applications from soil and hydrology to biological and food processing. thermally enhanced oil recovery. drying of textiles and granular materials. and many other engineering applications. Evaporation is a key process in land-atmosphere mass and energy exchange driving the hydrological cycle and affecting energy balance of terrestrial surfaces. Evaporative drying of terrestrial surfaces involves coupled heat and mass transfer and depends on hydraulic properties of the medium. energy input. and vapor exchange between the porous medium surface and the atmosphere. Despite the importance of landscape-scale evaporative water loss from terrestrial surfaces that affects water availability for plants and microorganisms inhabiting the soil. predictions remain a challenge due to complex interactions between ambient (eg. airflow turbulence and incoming shortwave radiation) and soil (eg. internal hydraulic properties and surface relief) conditions resulting in rich surface evaporation dynamics.This PhD thesis presents physically based models and experimental methods addressing links between surface-atmosphere interactions and evaporation dynamics during stage-I evaporation (vaporization plane at the surface) to account for new fundamental aspects of evaporative water losses from porous surfaces defining landscape-scale fluxes and drying dynamics.

This regulation ensures adequate photosynthetic carbon gain to satisfy the mesophyll demand (A) while regulating leaf-water losses through transpiration (T). The evolutionary pathway of this fundamental carbon-for-water trade-off is still largely unknown. but there is growing evidence that plant stomata have evolved physiological controls to maximize photosynthetic performance and provide sufficient water loss to maintain optimal leaf temperature from evaporative cooling. while also avoiding cavitation in the soil-root-xylem hydraulic system and desiccation.

1301603,Transition Governance towards a Bioeconomy: A Comparison of Finland and The Netherlands,2016,Rick Bosman and Jan Rotmans,8,Sustainability,10,1017,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In both Finland and The Netherlands strategies are being developed to switch from fossil to green resources in order to tackle the challenges of climate change and resource dependencies and to tap into the economic opportunities that arise. We investigated the similarities and differences in the transition process and governance strategies with respect to the transition towards a bioeconomy in both countries. using transition management as an evaluative lens. The research method involved comparative qualitative case study analysis through action research. We found that the governance approach in The Netherlands focusses on co-creating a long-term vision that informs for short-term action. on facilitating bottom-up regional clusters and promoting radical innovation through cooperation between vested players and frontrunners. Finland adopts a more traditional. top-down governance strategy. focussing on the shorter-term economic opportunities and incremental innovation that keep the overall structure of existing industries intact. We conclude that the Dutch government acts as a facilitator. while the Finnish government acts more as a director of the transition.

1301604,Carbon Lock-Out: Leading the Fossil Port of Rotterdam into Transition,2018,Rick Bosman and Derk Loorbach and Jan Rotmans and Roel van Raak,10,Sustainability,7,2558,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The port of Rotterdam is a global leader in the fossil fuel economy. with a 50% market share for fossil fuel products in North-Western Europe. Although it is one of the most efficient and innovative ports globally. over the last decade it has seen a gradual increase of pressures on its activities and the need to develop alternative low-carbon strategies. This paper describes how a turbulent energy context. growing societal pressure and a change in the leadership of the Port Authority opened up space for a transition management process. The process impacted the business strategy and the discourse amongst its leaders and contributed to the set-up of a transition unit and a change in investments. It subsequently led to an externally oriented transition arena process with incumbent actors in the port area and actors from outside around the transition pathway to a circular and bio-based economy. By exploring how transition management could support the repositioning of incumbent actors in the energy transition. the research contributes to discussions in the transitions literature on regime destabilisation. the role of (incumbent) actors in transitions. and large-scale energy-intensive industries as the next frontier in the energy transition.

1301615,How renewables will shift the balance of power,2013,Rick Bosman and Daniel Scholten,,Renew Economy,,,,Renewable energy sources are often hailed as the panacea for a plethora of challenges associated with the use of fossil fuels. Partly for good reasons; while a large-scale utilization of renewables diminishes energy scarcity and lowers various kinds of pollution. their potential to address energy related geopolitical tensions among producer. consumer. and transit countries remains to be seen. Whereas the political implications of the geographic and technological specificities of fossil fuels are well known. it is still highly uncertain what such implications are if we would move to an energy system based on renewable sources.This poses interesting questions regarding the future of our energy system: what does the development of renewable energy sources and supporting technologies imply for energy-related patterns of cooperation and conflict between producer. consumer. and transit countries?

1301617,Managing the Decline of Fossil Fuels in a Fossil Fuel Intensive Economy: The Case of The Netherlands,2020,Sem Oxenaar and Rick Bosman,,,,139-165,Palgrave Macmillan. Cham,To prevent dangerous climate change a majority of remaining fossil fuel reserves need to stay in the ground. This requires a transition towards a low-carbon energy system. For this transition to succeed specific attention should not only be given to building-up the desired low-carbon system. but also to breaking down and phasing out the old fossil fuel-based aspects of the energy system. The Netherlands. a fossil fuel intensive economy with a historically strong fossil fuel-based energy regime. provides an interesting case for the study of such a fossil fuel phase-out. Despite a long history of policy making aimed at increasing adoption of renewable energy (RE). the Netherlands ranked 2nd last in the European Union with 6% RE in 2017. This has been attributed to the strong independencies between the Dutch government and the fossil fuel industry.

1301618,No transition without conflict,2013,Rick Bosman,,European Energy Review,,,,For some the energy transition is mainly about tackling climate change by reducing CO2 emissions. for others it presents the solution to a plethora of problems including security. environmental pollution. excessive water use and dependency. Some even see decentralized renewable energy as the fuel for a more democratic energy system. Rex Tillerson. CEO of Exxon Mobil thinks that ‘rather than a wholesale shift in energy sources. this latest transition will be in how the world’s abundant supplies of oil and natural gas are developed. produced and consumed.’So. if one were to believe Mr. Tillerson. nothing will really change at all.A good example of this polemic relationship can be found in Germany. where two competing visions of the energy future are emerging ever more clearly and clashing repeatedly. On the one hand there is a strong push for a centralized structure involving CCS. nuclear power. offshore wind and even huge solar parks in the Sahara from which energy is imported. On the other hand advocates of a decentralized energy supply are growing in number and (political) clout. Whilst conventional energy production capacity used to be predominantly owned by a small number of large utilities. over half of newly installed renewables are now owned by citizens. farmers and energy cooperatives. Such cooperatives. also on the rise outside Germany. present an interesting form of social innovation in which citizens together develop completely new ways to organize the energy system driven by a sense of community and local ownership.

So far. most transition studies of community energy are focused on analysing empirical examples in the UK from a socio-technical Multi-Level Perspective (MLP). This paper takes a ‘complex transition perspective’to analyse community energy initiatives in four West-European countries (The Netherlands. Germany. Belgium and UK). The term ‘complex transition perspective’refers to an assemblage of perspectives in the field of transition research that share a basis in complex system thinking and action research. also referred to as the ‘systemic and reflexive approach’. The paper starts with ‘fresh empirical observations’ on community energy initiatives. describing drivers and barriers in the community energy initiatives. as experienced by practitioners involved. Subsequently. these empirical observations are considered from a complex transition perspective. specifying what the analytical implications are of taking such perspective. how this differs from the socio-technical Multi-Level Perspective. and what kind of implications it has for action research and policy regarding community energy initiatives and sustainability transitions.,True,tw3u_tkAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://d-nb.info/1079507183/34#page=141,,,,,https://d-nb.info/1079507183/34#page=141,0,0,0

In this study. ZnO nanowires (ZnO-NWs) are prepared on a FTO glass through chemical bath deposition. and then the surface of ZnO-NWs are precisely coated with a thin TiO2 layer step by step using a simple dipping–rinse–hydrolyzation (DRH) process to create the core–shell structure of ZnO@TiO2 nanowires (ZnO@TiO2-NWs) for improving the chemical stability of ZnO. This core–shell structure of ZnO@TiO2-NWs on a FTO glass is further used as the photoanode of a DSSC with an acidic N3 dye as sensitizer.

Surface reducibility. optical spectral characteristics. and catalytic rates and selectivity were correlated to catalyst composition.

1301637,Reverse water-gas shift iron catalyst derived from magnetite,2019,Chen-Yu Chou and Jason A Loiland and Raul F Lobo,9,Catalysts,9,773,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The catalytic properties of unsupported iron oxides. specifically magnetite (Fe 3 O 4). were investigated for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction at temperatures between 723 K and 773 K and atmospheric pressure. This catalyst exhibited a fast catalytic CO formation rate (35.1 mmol h− 1 g cat.− 1). high turnover frequency (0.180 s− 1). high CO selectivity (> 99%). and high stability (753 K. 45000 cm 3 h− 1 g cat.− 1) under a 1: 1 H 2 to CO 2 ratio. Reaction rates over the Fe 3 O 4 catalyst displayed a strong dependence on H 2 partial pressure (reaction order of~ 0.8) and a weaker dependence on CO 2 partial pressure (reaction order of 0.33) under an equimolar flow of both reactants. X-ray powder diffraction patterns and XPS spectra reveal that the bulk composition and structure of the post-reaction catalyst was formed mostly of metallic Fe and Fe 3 C. while the surface contained Fe 2+. Fe 3+. metallic Fe and Fe 3 C. Catalyst tests on pure Fe 3 C (iron carbide) suggest that Fe 3 C is not an effective catalyst for this reaction at the conditions investigated. Gas-switching experiments (CO 2 or H 2) indicated that a redox mechanism is the predominant reaction pathway.

Grafting of octylsilane groups did not significantly affect on the XRD pattern of laponite. However. octylsilane-treated laponite rapidly intercalates intraconozole without any prehydration process. Successful grafting of octylsilane groups mostly on the external surface was further confirmed by TGA curves and IR spectra. The amount of intercalated itraconozole was not affected by octylsilane grafting.

Furthermore. consumers purchase behavior is estimated by adopting a hedonic pricing model that reflects the shadow price of the products. The results show that there is more product diversification when firms have similar entry strategies but different new product development strategies.

Although previous studies did not consider the time lag and estimated indirectly the level using the R&D investment squared term. this study assumes 2 years time lag and uses the threshold estimation model to measure directly. We find that there is the S-curve relationship between the profit rate as R&D output and R&D intensity and the ratio of researchers to employees as R&D input. Also. we estimate the adequate levels of R&D investment. 6.4% for R&D intensity and 13% for the ratio of researchers to employees.

1301667,Flux switching machines using segmental rotors,2010,Ackim Zulu,,,,,Newcastle University,Flux switching machines (FSM) employing a segmental rotor have field and armature systems on the stator and a presentation of an unexcited rotor with isolated segments. The single-tooth winding arrangement on the stator provides a potential for material and energy savings. The principle for producing bipolar flux in the armature stator teeth relies on the natural switching of the armature tooth flux. accomplished by the moving segments of the rotor. Three phase configurations have been studied. from conception and design to construction and testing. with field excitation provided by either a field winding or permanent magnets (PM). Flux switching machines have shown characteristics that are peculiar when employing a segmental rotor. significantly affecting the symmetry of the induced armature EMF waveform and parity of magnitudes of the positive and negative torques. For three phase operation. six topologies are feasible when employing a 12-tooth stator and two other topologies may be produced on a 24-tooth stator. An optimum topology on the 12/8-configuration and another proof-of-principle topology on the 12/5-configuration. using field-windings and permanent-magnets. have been designed and constructed. while applying modern practices and considerations for manufacture. The characteristics of FSMs employing a segmental rotor. initially predicted by finiteelement (FE) modelling. have been verified by measurements.

This situation has led to the low water levels in two major water reservoirs used for hydroelectric power generation at the Kafue Gorge Power Station and the Kariba North Bank Power Station. As nearly 95% of the generated electricity comes from hydro resources. reduced rainfall activity has led to power rationing recently to a level which has never been experienced before. The 2015-2016 rain season. which runs from late October to early April. is forecast to be even worse due to the El Niño effect. with results of reduced rainfall over much of Southern Africa. In addition. the 2015 hot season turned out to be the hottest season Zambia has ever experienced. and led to high evaporation losses from open surface water bodies.This paper discusses the approach. in terms of policy and practice. the Zambian authorities have taken to mitigate the effects of the adverse climatic conditions in the energy and agricultural sectors of the country. The success of large scale farming is dependent on sustainable supply of electricity for irrigation. The sectors of agriculture and energy are currently under threat in Zambia due to the drought experienced in the 2015-2016 rain season.

The study. which was based on a case study of Renewable Energy involving six countries in Southern Africa. was based on established methodologies proposed by previous studies on harmonisation and profiling of higher education programmes. The study uses a general curriculum development approach leading to the definition of generic and specific competencies and feeding into a learning taxonomy to create alignment with specific learning outcomes at the intended qualification level. However. the approach extends the harmonisation concept to include industrialisation potential. which is crucial in the developing-country context. This allows for the exploitation of shared resources in sector-specific technology areas and supports the development of regional standards on technology and practice. as part of developing a sustainable regional economic sector. Twentytwo competencies. encompassing both generic and specific competencies. were defined. These competencies were grouped into six key competence areas. and later transformed into four clusters of competencies: core competencies. hard skills. soft skills and attitudes. These four clusters were then placed on a planetary system to represent the meta-profile for the qualification. which forms the framework for the future design of learning materials for the qualification.,True,KiHGsmkAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://tuningjournal.org/article/view/1600,,,,,https://tuningjournal.org/article/view/1600,0,0,0

Most of the countries have railway links with neighbouring countries resulting in the formation of a wide railway network. Majority of the locomotives currently in use in most of these countries are diesel powered despite efforts made by some countries such as South Africa and Zimbabwe of electrifying some of their domestic railway routes. The focus of the research article is on the economic and environmental benefits that Southern African countries can draw from an electrified railway network. It is expected that there would be reduced railway locomotive exhaust fumes-related pollutants in the environment resulting in cleaner air. High-speed associated with electric trains would encourage the use of railway transport for both passenger and heavy goods movement which at the moment are dominated by road and air transport. The use of comparatively safe and cost-effective railway transport would not only improve trade among member countries but also attract foreign investment. It is expected that transportation of industrial raw materials and finished products would not only be efficient but also costeffective. Reduction of heavy goods traffic would besides decongesting the roads. but also bring down the cost of road maintenance. Finally. the damaging effects of the locomotives’ exhaust fumes would be avoided if railway electrification was embarked on.

Existing literature on dynamic loading has explained the two main methods. ie. static temperature raising and real time loading techniques. used for upgrading the transmission capacity of existing transmission lines. However. the forms of the heat balance equation used to explain these techniques in many articles may not clearly be discerned. This paper uses the form of the heat balance equation that clearly shows how the parameters in the equation lead to increased loading of the overhead lines.

1301679,Paving the Way for Energy Efficiency through Solar Power Projects in Zambia,,Shadreck Mpanga and Mwansa Kaoma and Ackim Zulu,2,IJCMES: Open Access International Journal: Infogain Publication,Issue-3,,,At present. there is great pressure to meet the national electrical energy demand on the existing power system network in Zambia. The situation has been made worse due to reduced rainfall received in recent years as the country has mostly depended on hydroelectricity generation for many years. The 2015-2016 rain season saw little trickling of precipitation too due to the El Niño effect. with results of reduced rainfall over much of Southern Africa. In addition. the 2015 hot dry season turned out to be the hottest season Zambia had ever experienced. and led to high evaporation losses from open surface water bodies. This resulted in load shedding across the country thereby affecting households. business houses and the mining operations. All these are consequences of climate change. In harmony with the historic climate agreement adopted in Paris on December 12. 2015. this paper reviews how solar energy can help mitigate the effects of climate change and thus contribute to the national electricity mix in Zambia by increasing the power flow in the existing infrastructure as far as possible. By means of a comparative study. the merits and demerits of using photovoltaic technology for large scale electricity generation in Zambia are highlighted. In light of this. the potential of solar energy to contribute towards industrial energy efficiency in Zambia is assessed. The paper also advocates for increased research on renewable energy technologies.,True,KiHGsmkAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shadreck_Mpanga/publication/304134094_Paving_the_Way_for_Energy_Efficiency_through_Solar_Power_Projects_in_Zambia/links/5767952d08aedbc345f5ffaf.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shadreck_Mpanga/publication/304134094_Paving_the_Way_for_Energy_Efficiency_through_Solar_Power_Projects_in_Zambia/links/5767952d08aedbc345f5ffaf.pdf,0,0,0

We found that to achieve success in soil and water conservation policies. institutions and operations must be co-ordinated using a holistic approach. Watershed programmes have been shown to be one of the most effective strategies for bringing socio-economic change to different parts of India. Within both dryland and rainfed areas. watershed management has quietly revolutionized agriculture by aligning various sectors through technological soil and water conservation interventions and land-use diversification.

1301700,The extent and nature of tractorization in India: an overview of the past and current status and future trends,2012,VP Chaudhary and MP Singh,43,,4,24,,Mechanization is an unavoidable imperative to increase the productivity for the majority of farmers in India. The timeliness of operations has assumed greater significance in obtaining optimal yields from different crops. which has been possible by way of mechanization. The small size of holdings of the farmers is the main constraint of mechanization. The quantum of power available for the farming sector rose from 45.29 million kW in 1971-72 to over 170 million kW in 2000-01. Correspondingly. power intensity on the Indian farm increased from 0.2 kW/ha to 1.50 kW/ha on the basis of net-cropped area. The tractor density in India is about 11 tractors per thousand hectares as against 27 tractors per thousand hectares in USA. The world average including under-developed countries is 19 tractors per thousand hectares. The growth of the tractor manufacturing industry has been very rapid starting with 881 tractors in 1960-61 to above 310.000 tractors in the year 2005. The 31-40 HP tractor has the maximum share (51 percent) followed by 21-30 HP (18 percent) and above 40 HP (32 percent) in 2006. However. in recent years. the trend has shifted towards higher HP (above 40 HP) which growth has increased 24 percent in FY03 to 32 percent in FY06. There are currently 14 players in the tractor industry producing 60 models. However. about 90 percent of the market was covered by the top 5-6 players only. Mahindra & Mahindra is the leading player in the industry with 30 percent share while other players like TAFE+ Eicher. PTL.

It plays a key role in timeliness of farm operations. quality of work and enhanced agricultural production. The agricultural production is observing erratic yield variations and unpredicted negative impacts in the wake of climate changes globally. In view of present challenges throughout the production system. the future growth has to come from the acceleration in the rate of farm mechanization. The farm mechanization level in India is 40% with average 2.24 kW/ha farm power availability. On the other hand. Punjab has reached 4.4 kW/ha whereas in the hills of Uttarakhand. it is 1.05 kW/ha. The present mechanization is distinctly different throughout the country and still low to cope up with climatic variations in the agricultural sector as well as to enhance input use efficiency of natural resources. In addition to this. the crop residue is largely responsible for the degradation of climate during the peak season of wheat sowing due to the burning of crop residue. This chapter encapsules overall mechanization practices and the potential of some of the frontier farm machinery used in the various farm operations right from seedbed preparation to threshing and processing through enhanced input use efficiency for attaining climate-smart agriculture.

In this work. a low shear mixing device consisting of a box with two moving walls and three static walls was used again to study granular mixing as a function of particle size. The goal is to obtain a more in depth understanding of the internal behavior of granular material in the three dimensions when particle size is changed. Experiments at different particle size distributions and wall displacements were run. Results show that faster mixing is achieved with particles of high diameter. The particle size affected the granular movement at the three directions.

CA (USA); Consultants Computation Bureau. Oakland. CA (USA),The problem of determining the heat transfer processes in residences and commercial structures requires accurate analytical models if one is to adequately define energy conservation measures. Various energy analysis computer simulation programs are presently available for use in the public sector. Among these programs. DOE-2.1 B represents the state of the art in determining building thermal loads and energy usage quantities. However. the current version of DOE-2.1 B does not rigorously deal with the problem of heat transfer in earth contact structures. This situation. although minor when compared with the relatively comprehensive methodology utilized for the overall energy analysis of traditional above-grade buildings. nevertheless detracts from the primary goal of a well-defined simulation.Recently. a research version of DOE-2.1 B has been created with the addition of an algorithm that is used to analyze earth contact systems such as basements. crawl spaces. slabs. and berms. This paper describes the methodology used in the DOE-2.1 B program revisions and gives numerous examples regarding its applications. The mathematical technique employs the generation of a two-dimensional finite-element model from simplified uaer input definitions from which weekly response factors are generated for those surfaces in contact with the ground. Weekly averaged weather parameters provide the external excitations used to define the thermal load within the earth contact space.,True,WSxy1UgAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,11,https://escholarship.org/content/qt48w9w7vt/qt48w9w7vt.pdf,10163811471408996568,/scholar?cites=10163811471408996568,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt48w9w7vt/qt48w9w7vt.pdf,0,0,0

At stake were millions of barrels of oil in the Tweneboa Enyenra Ntomme (TEN) oilfields. an area discovered in 2009 and brought to production in 2016–at a time the case was already brought before ITLOS with a request for provisional measures. which put a temporary halt to the full development of the field.This is the second delimitation case brought before ITLOS and the first before a Special Chamber of the Tribunal. constituted pursuant to article 15 (2) of the ITLOS Statute upon an agreement of the Parties. In reaching its final decision. the tribunal fully reviewed both the delimitation provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) and the extensive delimitation jurisprudence produced by other international courts and tribunals. To a certain extent. the judgment reads like a consolidation of the law of maritime delimitation. solidly erected on established principles and practices over the determination of a single maritime boundary and the three-stage process. involving a provisional equidistance line adjusted on the basis of relevant circumstances and controlled through a disproportionality test to ensure an equitable result. The interesting elements to be found in this judgment are not new in content but rather in the emphasis accorded to their normative scope: the primacy of State consent remains the foundation myth of international law–and it is reaffirmed in this case.

Moreover. we will also conduct panel data method to analyze the determinants of energy intensity in the firm level data. The result suggests that during the period given. even though the level of energy intensity in the industry relatively worse than the national level but the condition of energy intensity in Indonesian industry varies across sub sectors.

1301818,ICT and economic development: Conclusion from IO Analysis for Selected ASEAN Member States,2013,Tony Irawan,,,disbei192,,Universitätsbibliothek Wuppertal. University Library,The impact of information and communications technology (ICT) on economic performance has been an interesting issue in economics. There are at least three key points that can be learnt from the previous literatures regarding ICT and country’s economic performance. First. more developed countries are expected to benefit greater than less developed countries. Second. the impact of ICT will depend on the intensity of ICT utilization. Third. the size and structure of ICT sector of country’s economy does matter. The main contribution of this paper is to evaluate those three points by conducting comparative analysis based on Input-Output (I-O) Table from four ASEAN Member States. namely Indonesia. Singapore. Malaysia and Thailand. ASEAN is used because it is one of the regional associations that have a large income gap among its members. The results suggest that more developed countries (which are measured by income per capita) do not always benefit greater than less developed countries from ICT development. The magnitude of ICT impact on the economy depends on the intensity of ICT utilization and the structure of ICT sector,True,uwr_6YsAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,9,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bwu/eiiwdp/disbei192.html,13851781896474262109,/scholar?cites=13851781896474262109,,,,0,0,0

However. it is very fragile from internal and external shock. Thus. government intervention is substantially needed to offset the negative impact that might be occurred due to internal and external shocks. In this paper we will analyze the impact of both government fiscal policy and central bank monetary policy on industry and Indonesian economic performance by using the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. Fiscal and monetary policy will have a positive impact on Indonesian macroeconomic performance in terms of change in real GDP. investment. consumption. and capital rate of return. with the biggest impact of fiscal policy.

The Indonesian government (GoI) has set a strategy to gradually remove fuel subsidies to meet its 2050 ambitious energy targets. Using a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. the present study aimed to determine whether or not the current energy subsidy reforms would meet the targets of both energy mix and energy intensity. It also incorporated the environmental aspect while developing a source of a detailed database in the energy sector. The energy subsidy reform policy (followed by an increase in infrastructure and renewable energy investments) could be the most appropriate alternative policy if the government aims to reduce energy intensity and emission. as well as improve energy diversification without pronounced reductions in the sectorial and overall economy. However. all simulations suggested that the removal of energy subsidy does not enough in attaining the targeted energy mix and energy intensity goals. Thus. the Indonesian government should also introduce progressive programs in renewable energy.

Calculating potential earnings from grid services and charging strategies highly depends on the driving time. driving distance. and time spent at different locations. While few datasets describing EV usage exist. this work is based on one of the most extensive datasets gathered from 7.163 Nissan LEAFs. Using the real driving and charging data it was possible to calculate the value of a specific charging strategy for the individual EV. The EV dataset was used in a simulation based on British electricity transmission network operating codes and frequency measurement data.

In order to understand ecological and economic resolutions. the lignite-fired plant was studied both before and after the installation of the FGD. The focus of this study was to consider not only the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) outcome but also the Life Cycle Costing (LCC) factors. The results can provide valuable information when selecting appropriate technologies to minimize the negative impact that lignite-fired power plants have on the environment. The Life Cycle Assessment—Numerical Eco-load Total Standardization (LCA-NETS) was used to evaluate the impact on the environment of both the lignite-fired plant and the FGD. Life Cycle Costing (LCC) was used to provide a comparison between alternatives before and after installation of FGD. The externalities model was designed to study the relationship of the life cycle environmental impacts and life cycle cost values. The results of the study are shown in the eco-load values over the entire life cycle of the lignite-fired plant which indicates that the installation of the FGD system can reduce the acidification problem. associated with lignite-fired plants. by approximately 97%.

E-cigarettes use a heating element to create an aerosol from a solution usually consisting of propylene glycol. glycerol. and nicotine. Despite the wide spread of e-cigarettes. information about aerosol size distributions is rather sparse. This can be caused by the relative newness of e-cigarettes and by the difficulty of the measurements. in which one has to deal with high concentration aerosol containing volatile compounds.

The distribution grid itself affects the heat flow dynamics of a district heating network. which subsequently governs the heat delays and entire efficiency of the distribution. For an efficient control of the network. a control system must be able to predict how “temperature waves” move through the network. This prediction must be sufficiently accurate for real-time computations of operational parameters. Future control systems may also benefit from the accumulation capabilities of pipes. In this article. the key physical phenomena affecting the transients in pipes were identified. and an efficient numerical model of aboveground district heating pipe with heat accumulation was developed. The model used analytical methods for the evaluation of source terms. Physics of heat transfer in the pipe shells was captured by one-dimensional finite element method that is based on the steady-state solution. Simple advection scheme was used for discretization of the fluid region. Method of lines and time integration was used for marching. The complexity of simulated physical phenomena was highly flexible and allowed to trade accuracy for computational time. In comparison with the very finely discretized model. highly comparable transients were obtained even for the thick accumulation wall.

J,,1783-1788,,Purpose of physical and chemical waste processing is to recycle the materials. produce secondary materials or energy. eliminate or decrease waste toxicity. decrease the hazardous potential of waste. and minimize the waste volume [Beniak 2015]. Some of the waste may be processed directly in a place of its producers; however. hazardous chemical waste. especially complicated mixtures. must be treated in specialized processing facilities. Czech legislation considers the following methods to constitute thermal waste processing: waste oxidation and other thermic processing of waste including incineration of produced matter that leads to higher level of pollution compared to incineration of the same amount of natural gas with similar energy content. Waste production is ever rising and therefore it is wise to focus on development of technologies for its secondary exploitation. This measure will greatly decrease the share of landfilled waste and negative environmental impact. Capacity of WTE plants may be to a certain degree increased. As mentioned above. in addition to waste incineration technologies we may further take advantage of pyrolysis and gasification (especially in fluid reactors).

Phase transitions of the liquid very often occur at low temperatures at pressures ranging in the thousands of pascals. which enhances the heat transfer. This paper focuses on the issue of a heat-transfer coefficient that is experimentally examined at the surface of a tube bundle. The tube is located in a low-pressure chamber where the vacuum is generated using an exhauster via an ejector. The tube consists of smooth copper tubes of 12 mm diameter placed horizontally one above another. Heating water flows in the bundle from the bottom towards the top at an average input temperature of approximately 40 C and an average flow rate of approximately 7.2 L min–1. A falling film liquid at an initial temperature of approximately 15 C at an initial tested pressure of approximately 97 kPa (atmospheric pressure) is sprinkled onto the tubes’ surface. Afterwards. the pressure in the chamber is gradually decreased. When reaching the minimum pressure of approximately 3 kPa (abs) the water partially evaporates at the lower part of the bundle. Consequently. the influence of the falling film liquid temperature increase is tested. This gradually leads to the boiling of water in a significant part of the bundle and the residual cooling liquid that drops back to the bottom of the vessel is almost not heated anymore.

This implies that a number of refrigeration and heat pump systems need to adopt new refrigerants that have low GWP and satisfy a number of important criteria as for instance good thermophysical and transport properties. safety. stability and etc. As none of the known refrigerants is superior to the others in respect to all the selection criteria. choosing refrigerant is always a complex decision-making process that is based on a number of important criteria. In this paper we investigate the applicability of an analytical hierarchy process method for multi-criteria decision making of selecting a refrigerant for a heat pump system. Potential low GWP refrigerants are studied and important refrigerant selection criteria are considered. The criteria are weighted for each of the alternative refrigerant in order to rank different refrigerant alternatives. The method is applied from perspective of a number of stakeholders. The results suggest that it is possible to identify the refrigerant alternative that is optimal for a given application. using the process presented in the paper.

Different environmental metrics are used to facilitate decision-making process of selection of refrigerant with low environmental impact. Total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) methodology is able to reflect the effect of heat pump or refrigeration system to global warming by accounting for both direct and indirect emissions associated with the refrigeration system. This paper extends TEWI methodology by using Global Temperature change Potential (GTP) metric instead of Global Warming Potential (GWP) one. which conventionally used to put different emissions on single CO2 scale. The analysis is done for the simple vapour compression heat pump system. where a number of refrigerants are compared.

A major limitation of fuel cells is the weak ion conductivity within the ~2-30 nm thick. ion-conducting polymer (ionomer)-based catalyst-binder layer over electrodes. Here. we strategically sulfonated kraft lignin (a by-product of pulp and paper industries) to design ionomers with varied ion exchange capacities (IECs) (LS x; x= IEC) that can potentially overcome this interfacial ion conduction limitation. We measured the ion conductivity. water uptake. ionic domain characteristics. density. and predicted the water mobility/stiffness of Nafion. LS 1.6. and LS 3.1 in sub-micron thick hydrated films. LS 1.6 showed ion conductivity an order of magnitude higher than Nafion and LS 3.1 in films with similar thickness. The ion conductivity of these films was not correlated to their water uptake and IECs. Within the three-dimensional. less dense. branched architecture of LS 1.6 macromolecules. the –SO3H and –OH groups are in close proximity. which likely facilitated the formation of larger ionic domains having highly mobile water molecules. As compared to LS 1.6. LS 3.1 showed a higher glass transition temperature and film stiffness at dry state which sustained during humidification. On the contrary. Nafion stiffened significantly upon humidification. The smaller ionic cluster within stiff LS 3.1 and Nafion films thus led to ion conductivity lower than LS 1.6.

This paper presents new findings from longwall mining-induced fractures. stress distribution changes in roof strata. strata movement and gas flow dynamics after the lower protective coal seam is extracted in a deep underground coal mine in Jincheng. China. Two Flac 3D models with varying gob loading characteristics as a function of face advance were analyzed to assess the effect of gob behavior on stress relief in the protected coal seam. The gob behavior in the models is incorporated by applying variable force to the floor and roof behind the longwall face to simulate gob loading characteristics in the field. The influence of mining height on the stress-relief in protected coal seam is also incorporated. The stress relief coefficient and relief angle were introduced as two essential parameters to evaluate the stress relief effect in different regions of protected coal seam.

However. the resultant permeabilities from different PDMs are full of controversy because of the variability in the measured permeabilities. Such variability results from the different analytical solutions used for measured data interpretation. An in-depth review is provided on permeability measurement techniques. including the steady-state and various unsteady-state methods. By comparison. it is concluded that the PDMs are the best option when performing permeability measurements under in-situ stress/strain conditions.

1302014,Experimental Study of CO2-Water-Mineral Interactions and Their Influence on the Permeability of Coking Coal and Implications for CO2-ECBM,2018,Hui Guo and Xiaoming Ni and Yanbin Wang and Xiaomin Du and Tengteng Yu and Ruimin Feng,8,Minerals,3,,MDPI,Coal permeability is one of the most critical parameters affecting gas flow behavior during coalbed methane (CBM) production. However. little research has been conducted on how permeability evolves after CO 2 injection in coking coal. Hence. examining possible chemical interactions between coal minerals. water. and injected CO 2 can be very helpful to better characterize coking coal. In this study. coking coal specimens obtained from the Malan and Tunlan mines located in the Gujiao block of the Qinshui basin were treated with water and CO 2 to achieve a better understanding of their dissolution kinetics. pore structure. and permeability. It was found that the relative carbonate mineral content decreases with time. while the relative clay mineral content increases after the reaction with CO 2 and water. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed these mineral alteration phenomena. Carbonate minerals (calcite. dolomite) dissolve faster than clay minerals (montmorillonite. illite and kaolinite). In particular. the dissolution rates of Ca 2+ in carbonate minerals increases with decreasing temperature (25–45 C) and pH (4.3–6.3). and the dissolution rate of Ca 2+ ions in the calcite reaction solution is higher than that in the dolomite solution. In addition. the results of low-pressure nitrogen adsorption analysis showed that CO 2 injection can enlarge smaller size pores into larger size pores and change the overall pore size distribution. Therefore. CO 2 injection can increase the porosity of coal beds and ultimately their permeability. which in turn facilitates CBM production.

1302015,Analysis of Analytical Models Developed under the Uniaxial Strain Condition for Predicting Coal Permeability during Primary Depletion,2017,Chuanming Li and Zhiqiang Wang and Lei Shi and Ruimin Feng,10,Energies,11,1849,MDPI,The stress-dependent permeability of coal during coalbed methane production has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. However. how permeability changes as a function of stress variation is somewhat unclear to date. and currently used analytical models fail to accurately predict permeability evolution with gas depletion. Considering that the role played by changes in in situ stress in permeability evolution is critical. a comprehensive theoretical study was first conducted. through which it was found that coal permeability is determined by mean effective stress. Moreover. the influence of matrix shrinkage on cleat deformation and then coal permeability was overestimated by currently used models. leading to inaccuracy of the predicted permeability. By taking both mean effective stress and the influence of matrix shrinkage on cleat deformation into account. a new permeability model was developed under the uniaxial strain condition in order to precisely estimate permeability evolution during gas depletion. An in-depth investigation and comparison among four commonly-used permeability models. the Palmer and Mansoori (P&M) model. Improved P&M model. Shi and Durucan (S&D) model. and Cui and Bustin (C&B) model. was then conducted. It was experimentally verified that a good match can be achieved between the lab data and the results predicted by the proposed model. Permeability variation of coalbed reservoirs associated with gas depletion is a consequence of two opposing effects: mechanical compaction and matrix shrinkage. In comparison. it was found that the coefficients of these two effects incorporated in …,True,LJQ5BC0AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,10,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/11/1849,3453330195524725225,/scholar?cites=3453330195524725225,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/11/1849/pdf,0,0,0

Thus. accurately evaluating the stress and deformation state of surrounding rock is infeasible in non-uniform stress field when employing the mechanical model developed for uniform stress conditions. To reflect the real mechanical state of the roadway surrounding rock accurately and calculate the radius of the plastic zone in roadway surrounding rock precisely. a mechanical model of roadway surrounding rock under non-uniform stress conditions was established in this study based on unified strength theory.

The study focused in particular on the potential impacts of climate change on the water supply sector. dry-land agriculture. hydropower. roads infrastructure costs and sea level rise. These factors have not been previously considered in a fully integrated way for South Africa.

South Africa’s latest electricity plan due to be released shortly. We have used a similar modelling methodology. with the addition of an economic model to account for key indicators such as employment and economic growth. and assessed all the key assumptions used in the draft IRP 2018 against available evidence as the basis for our analysis. We have also assumed that existing coal power plants will be required to conform with current air pollution legislation. which will impose further costs on the existing system not taken into account by the draft IRP 2018. In addition. we have assessed the suitability of one of the most important drivers of the IRP–the greenhouse gas emissions constraint–in the light of South Africa’s overall mitigation potential. with the aim of understanding better the contribution which the electricity sector should be making. especially in the light of future contributions to the global mitigation effort South Africa wil be required to make in the next decade. We have modelled two scenarios:1) Reference scenario: A least-cost electricity investment plan using the best available evidence on key parameters.

While not the largest contributor to emissions in the country. the sector contributes a sizeable proportion of total emissions (> 10%). due to its dependence on fossil fuels. Decarbonization in the sector is therefore necessary to reduce emissions in line with the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution commitments. Developments in transport freight technologies over the past decade provide commercially viable options for switching to cleaner fuels. This paper assesses the potential for fuel and technology switching within the freight sector. and the associated economic impacts of this. using a linked energy-economic modelling approach. The underlying data and models used in this analysis are described in detail for the freight sector in this paper. The results from the analyses highlight two important observations:(i) decarbonizing the road freight transport sector does not have to come at a cost to the economy; and (ii) picking low-hanging fruit in terms of emissions reductions decreases the cost to decarbonizing the economy.,True,EIo7AUkAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,4,https://sa-tied.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/SATIED_WP60_Merven_Hartley_Ahjum_April_2019.pdf,9217209159715608908,/scholar?cites=9217209159715608908,,,https://sa-tied.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/SATIED_WP60_Merven_Hartley_Ahjum_April_2019.pdf,0,0,0

A transition in the transport sector is seemingly inevitable considering these priorities. This study outlines some key socio-economic implications of a transition in South Africa's transport system. building on work previously done. The focus was on a rapid decarbonisation of the South African economy and the potential impacts of implementing efficiency improvements in the transport sector. including mode-switching. The overall finding was that a more ambitious decarbonisation target would have marginal impact on the economy relative to South Africa's nationally-determined contribution. It was further found that the implementation of efficiency improvements and changes in behaviour (decreased mileage. increased occupancy. increased rail use and increased use of public transport) could significantly reduce the burden on the economy of a higher GHG emission reduction target.,True,EIo7AUkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,4,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2017000400002,13821882956394306572,/scholar?cites=13821882956394306572,,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2017000400002,0,0,0

A prohibitive tariff stimulates domestic chicken meat production but also imposes significant costs on consumers and encourages illicit trade. However. a substantial poultry industry. producing mostly eggs. will exist independent of the border policy applied to chicken meat. due to the natural protection offered to local producers in the egg subsector. A subsector analysis of an egg production cluster in Ghana highlights the importance of trade links with other West African countries in developing the egg subsector.

The objective of these advances is twofold. First. to capture more accurately the impacts of changing coal costs on potential energy and emissions pathways for South Africa through the impacts of higher coal prices on the economy and on employment. Second. better representation of the coal sector provides insights on the timing and magnitude of coal-mine and power plant retirements. which are crucial to developing policies required to ameliorate any negative impacts resulting from the energy transition. To illustrate the model advances two potential power generation pathways for South Africa are compared: a leastcost energy mix which does not include new coal power plants; and one where renewable capacity in the power sector is constrained. resulting in~ 25GW new coal-fired power plant capacity. A comparison of these scenarios shows that. with rising coal costs and lower coal export demand. persisting with coal-based power generation does not “save jobs” in South Africa at the aggregate level. as higher power investment is required in the constrained scenario.

Seawater desalination for sustaining agricultural production is being reported as an alternative water source in some Mediterranean countries. It represents an abundant and steady water source which effectively removes the climatological and hydrological constraints. However. first experiences are highlighting that certain important issues can become a barrier to its spread for crop irrigation. First. the high-energy requirement is still an essential feature of seawater desalination. leading to production costs several times higher than other agricultural water sources. Moreover. the high greenhouse gas emissions linked to the intensive use of energy could exacerbate climate change. Additionally. there are important agronomic concerns related to the lack of desalinated seawater …,True,Qnv5uScAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC,79,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001191641530134X,15855727346237099238,/scholar?cites=15855727346237099238,,,,0,0,0

The selected area was Campo de Cartagena Irrigation District. which covers 41.065 ha in the Segura Basin (Spain). one of the most water stressed regions in Europe. A set of performance indicators was selected to characterise the effect of specific processes (modernisation) or circumstances (water scarcity) in the service or behaviour of the irrigation district. The results clearly show that water supply restrictions contributed to the important performance changes observed over time to a much greater extent than the modernisation process did. Fluctuations in water availability resulted in high variations in performance indicators.

The objective is to obtain insight in spatial and temporal patterns and differences in groundwater usage of perennial (mainly fruit trees) and seasonal crops (mainly row vegetable crops) under varying climatic conditions. Cropping intensities of seasonal crops are derived for each sector and irrigation water applied (IWA) is calculated using VI-based (NDVI from MODIS) actual evapotranspiration estimates and local efficiency factors. Groundwater use is then derived as the residual of total IWA and surface water supplies for each sector and crop type.

For glasses used in architectural. automotive safety. and decorative applications. hardness (resistance to scratches. and indentation) also plays a vital role. The present work includes measurement of hardness of laminated glasses (LG) with different interlayer (Polyvinyl butyral (PVB). Ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) and sanitary glass) and their different critical thicknesses (0.38. 0.76. 1.52 mm). Hardness is tested using Rockwell hardness test and Mohr’s hardness test. It is found that hardness of PVB reduces with increase in inter layer thickness. Similar trend is also observed for EVA and SG inter layered LG. The highest hardness is obtained for SG inter layered LG which is found to be near the hardness of monolithic glass. The effect of inter layer type and inter layer thickness on hardness is clearly observed from this brief study. The regression analysis also reflects that the hardness of LG depends on inter layer type and inter layer thickness. The significance F value concludes the dependability of hardness on inter layer material and thickness. Similarly.

The flow was controlled using the submerged type vortex generator (VG) in combination with the rear spoiler during the investigation. The model of a vehicle was fabricated on the reducing scale (15: 1) using the Plaster of Paris (PoP). Primarily. the vehicle was tested at the different incidence yaw angles to obtain the total drag over the model. Further. twenty-six different combinations obtained by changing the flow angles (β= 0 and±30). spoiler angles (α= 0 and±45) and orientations of VGs were tested. A variation of static pressures and drag coefficients for all combinations was analyzed. Further. the development of secondary-flow was also traced. Secondary flow becomes important as it causes a sheared flow produced near the body and wall of a sadden vehicle which further deflects the air pressure on the roof of the vehicle body. The variation of the secondary flow was obtained with the wall static pressure. surface static pressure and boundary layer by changing the flow angles (β= 0 and±30). and spoiler angles (α= 0 and±45) and orientations of VGs. The best combination in terms of surface static pressure coefficient (Cwp) rise (from–0.041 to+ 2.622) is found at β= 0. α= 0 and the VG attached to the upstream of the spoiler.

Also. growing demand for water for both domestic and industrial use has brought an increased interest in use of Air Cooled condensers. This is a review paper which studies the performance of Air-cooled condenser under various operating conditions it is found that there is degradation in performance of air cooled condenser under high ambient temperatures and windy conditions. The heat rejection rate of ACC also depends on surface condition of fins and thus its performance is reduced due to external fouling of finned tubes due to weather conditions and by internal fouling from condensate (Ammonia corrosion).A Hybrid (dry/wet) dephlegmator achieves major enhancement in performance when ambient temperatures are high. Also shading of condensers is done for air-conditioning units to mitigate the adverse effect of high ambient temperatures due to solar radiation.

1302115,Analysis of Knuckle Joint of 30C8 Steel for Automobile Application,2014,Sourav Das and Vishvendra Bartaria and Prashant Pandey and LNCT Bhopal,,"IJERT, ISSN",,2278-0181,,The aim of the present paper is to study calculate the stresses in Knuckle joint using analytical method. Further study in this direction can made by using various directions of the pin and the capacity to withstand load. It is also to be noted that instead of mild steel pin we can also use high strength high modulus steel pin that can further enhance the capacity to withstand higher loads. The shape of the knuckle joint can be changed for improved properties. One can carry out the analysis by changing the shape in the part in the knuckle joint in order to conserve materials and energy. The knuckle joint is proposed to develop in the present study is for an applied force of 25 KN. The diameter of the pin is proposed to be around 23 mm. The material of the knuckle joint is considered as mild steel grade 30C8. in order to do the stress analysis; mesh was developed for the knuckle joint. The mesh consists of 64229 nodes and 4310 elements. ANSYS software was run and the stress contour. displacement contour. strain energy contour were obtained. Based on the ANSYS analysis it shows that a pin of 23mm diameter can withstand a load of 25 kN if we use a factor of safety of 2. Further optimization of the diameter of pin. it depicts that a pin of 12 mm is enough to withstand a load of 25 kN. however if we use a pin of 25 mm the range of pulling load can be enhance to even 80 kN.,True,2VdaccQAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,8,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sourav-Das-35/publication/327221007_Analysis_of_Knuckle_Joint_of_30C8_Steel_for_Automobile_Application/links/5b90d6fea6fdcce8a4c80355/Analysis-of-Knuckle-Joint-of-30C8-Steel-for-Automobile-Application.pdf,11753741431352791023,/scholar?cites=11753741431352791023,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sourav-Das-35/publication/327221007_Analysis_of_Knuckle_Joint_of_30C8_Steel_for_Automobile_Application/links/5b90d6fea6fdcce8a4c80355/Analysis-of-Knuckle-Joint-of-30C8-Steel-for-Automobile-Application.pdf,0,0,0

In order to improve the thermal performance artificial roughness is provided on the underside of absorber plate due to which turbulence is created in the heat transfer zone and ultimately performance of solar air heater improves considerably. This paper presents the study of heat transfer in a rectangular duct of a solar air heater having triangular rib roughness on the absorber plate by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The effect of Reynolds number on Nusselt number was investigated to study the heat transfer. friction factor and flow characteristics in a solar air heater having triangular rib roughness on the absorber plate. The computations based on the finite volume method with the SIMPLE algorithm have been conducted for the air flow in terms of Reynolds numbers ranging from 4000–20000 and p/e (4 to 20) has been carried out with k-ε turbulence model is selected by comparing the predictions of different turbulence models with experimental results available in various literature. In present work computational fluid dynamics software (Fluent 6.3 Solver) has been used for simulation. Fluid flow (FLUENT) module has been used in present work. Fluid flow (FLUENT) module predicts the outlet temperature. velocity. flow behavior to great accuracy due to application of thermal loading on the work piece.

In conventional methods of air distribution. the supply air is used to provide a uniformly mixed thermal environment in the room. The conditioned air is supplied from the ceiling through ducts and the air is returned back from the ceiling itself. An alternative to this arrangement is the supply of air from floor-based diffusers and the returning air is extracted through the ceiling. In this arrangement the air is required to be supplied at the same or slightly less temperature than the temperature required for the comfort within the occupied space. The supply air mixes with the room air and produces a non-uniform thermal environment in the room. A two-layered stratification is thus produced and energy can be saved by conditioning of the occupied space only.

Accanto alle trasformazioni fisiche e morfolo-giche dei tessuti urbani si colloca. per lo meno a parere di alcuni auto-ri (cfr. par. 1.2). il rivoluzionamento nei modi di vivere gli spazi.

La centralità della tematica assume ulteriore valenza in tal senso poiché l’accesso al bene casa e la qualità dei luoghi d’insediamento sono valutati quali passaggi ineludibili per ampliare le chance d’interazione socio-culturale e le opportunità d’inserimento socioeconomico (Dorr. Faist. 1997; Dell’Olio. 2004). A queste considerazioni si associano il richiamo della Carta fondamentale dei Diritti dell’Unione europea sul riconoscimento e diritto all’assistenza sociale e abitativa per tutti coloro che non hanno sufficienti risorse. e l’invito del Parlamento europeo ai paesi membri di cooperare al fine di implementare il diritto e l’accesso a una buona abitazione per tutti. condizione necessaria per garantire la coesione sociale (European Parliament. 1997).,True,M8Sro8gAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,21,http://www.integrazionemigranti.gov.it/archiviodocumenti/Documents/Politiche%20urbane%20e%20abitative.pdf,6738221048242220202,/scholar?cites=6738221048242220202,,,http://www.integrazionemigranti.gov.it/archiviodocumenti/Documents/Politiche%20urbane%20e%20abitative.pdf,0,0,0

La prima riguarda il crollo della piattaforma Larsen-B nell’Antartide. Una tragedia ambientale. determinata dalle temperature relativamente alte. che–all'inizio della primavera–hanno provocato lo smembramento in migliaia di iceberg di una piattaforma glaciale formatasi 12.000 anni fa ed estesa come la Valle d'Aosta. La seconda tragedia. ben più dram-matica per il suo contenuto umano immediato. riguarda il suicidio di un ragazzo quasi quindicenne. Francesco. rappresentante di classe in prima liceo scientifico al «Galileo Galilei» di Legnano e considerato da tutti uno studente modello. Di fronte a un due in inglese. Francesco non ha retto alla disperazione e. durante l'in-tervallo. con una piccola rincorsa. un piede sulla sedia e l'altro sul davanzale della finestra–aperta per cambiare l'aria–si è buttato nel vuoto dal terzo piano dell'edificio scolastico. Che cosa c'è in comune tra queste due tragedie? Apparente-mente nulla. ma–osservando questi avvenimenti in profondità-si può notare che in entrambe le situazioni sono venuti meno dei legami. Nel caso della piattaforma glaciale. il calore dell'atmosfe-ra ha fatto saltare i legami molecolari che. dalla più remota prei-storia fino ai nostri giorni. hanno tenuto assieme in modo com-patto questa enorme massa di ghiaccio. legandola saldamente all’Antartide.

Nondestructive inspection found that the surface of inner wall of the pipe experienced erosion– corrosion and from metallography analysis. it is strongly evidenced that the leakage occurred on the base metal due to the severe erosion–corrosion at the localized area. The severe erosion–corrosion occurred was induced by the elbow of the pipe and the excessive root penetration causing flow turbulence and continuing to progressive wall thinning of the pipe.,True,-IKudAoAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,http://eprints.itenas.ac.id/345/,,,,,http://eprints.itenas.ac.id/345/2/Leakage%20on%20Water%20Cooling%20Distribution.pdf,0,0,0

To describe properties of ‘hot’Diesel fuel sprays. new sub-models for spray break-up. droplet heating and evaporation and Shell autoignition were implemented into the KIVA II CFD code. This customised version of the KIVA II code was used to simulate autoignition in Diesel engines. The results of simulation were shown to be consistent with in-house experimental data referring to autoignition timing at in-cylinder pressures from 5 to 9 MPa and an injection pressure of 160 MPa. The autoignition delay time is shown to be sensitive to the choice of liquid phase models for droplet heating. but not sensitive to the choice of gas phase models. It is recommended that the effective thermal conductivity liquid phase model and the gas phase model taking into account the effects of finite thickness of the thermal boundary layer are used for the simulation of the ignition process in Diesel engines.

The case study presented here is a proposed BWB design for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) known as “Baseline-II” that is actually a completely-revised. redesigned version of “Baseline-I” BWB (also known as HANTU). The Baseline-II features simpler planform. broader-chord wing and slimmer body than its predecessor while maintaining wing span. The objective is to improve flight performance at low cruising speed by increasing lift-to-drag ratio through planform redesign and inverse twist method on airfoils throughout its span. Low-fidelity aerodynamic computation with simplification to computation model is made at this stage to reduce design time. Baseline-I’s large centre elevator is replaced by smaller canard to achieve sufficient longitudinal stability while increasing lift as opposed to the former which degrades lift during flight. The result is that Baseline-II achieves higher aerodynamic efficiency (lift-to-drag ratio) and it is able to cruise at lower airspeed with lower thrust required than Baseline-I.,True,s-kIDFQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,14,https://www.academia.edu/download/40648057/EnCon2010_Rizal.pdf,16830981144857082768,/scholar?cites=16830981144857082768,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/40648057/EnCon2010_Rizal.pdf,0,0,0

A suction fan takes air or gas from the working chamber and releases it outside. When the air or gas is flowing from the inlet to the outlet. some recirculation zones may be formed depending on the internal shape design of the fume cupboard. This recirculation zone may create back flow that can be the cause of leakage. Leakage happens when airborne contaminants escape through inlet of the fume cupboard to the user breathing zone and the surrounding air in the room. To have a good fume cupboard. the recirculation zone needs to be minimised.

High population growth and increasing demands on agriculture for food security and livelihoods are exacerbating this threat in South Asia. where soils have also been affected by intensive agriculture and a heavy reliance on agro-chemical inputs. Traditional practices that sustain soil fertility–such as fallowing and crop rotations–are increasingly neglected due to the need to keep land in continuous cultivation. At the same time. sources of organic matter in rural areas are in short supply. The result is a decline in soil organic matter that is not replaced by farmyard manure. organic fertilisers or agronomic practices.

The process of cooperation is the art of improvising on the ground when the original project plan doesn’t quite match reality. This study analyses the logic behind the improvising of implementation on the ground. It found that the running of this project is not following project management procedures and log-frame indicators but is instead based on the experiences of agricultural extension in China. Through Chinese experts. as individual actors. ATDC brought in the approach of top-down planning. assumption of package support and integration of commercial functions which can be found in the reformed extension system in China. The Chinese experts carry this working approach – along with its assumptions and principles – to Ethiopia. without considering the lack of any parallel institution and culture there at the beginning. This results in many challenges for implementing the ATDC activities and novel reactions by the ATDC experts. which also reflect the individual’s working style in the Chinese extension system.

They argue that while the project is an anomaly in its success. it holds many lessons for how development projects can be conducted more effectively. In order to be sustainable. the authors contend that development projects should first try to guarantee peasant subsistence; build upon indigenous techniques and knowledge; focus on pressing but frequently overlooked problems that people in developing countries face in everyday life; and limit projects to tinkering with what already exists while eschewing a ‘grand design’ approach. In order to move from a situation where successful projects are the exception. to one where they are the rule. it requires fundamental re-thinking of the approach that development agencies take to projects.,True,ao4coyoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,5,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.development.1110383,2370350695132202548,/scholar?cites=2370350695132202548,,,,0,0,0

Many investments are in forested or woodland areas. some directly involve logging. while others–such as mining. infrastructure and agribusiness–indirectly affect forests and rural livelihoods. While foreign investment from other countries is also having a significant impact on African forests. the scale and increasing volume of Chinese investment merits special attention. More than 75 per cent of African timber exports go to China (Huang and Sun. 2013); in the case of Mozambique. the share is over 90 per cent (Muianga and Macqueen. 2015). Chinese investment in the mining. infrastructure and agricultural sectors. which also affects African forest and woodland areas. is also rising. This recent growth in Chinese investment in Africa brings with it the threat of increased degradation and unsustainable resource extraction. but also opportunities to enhance the sustainability of African forestry and to benefit local communities.Reliable numbers on the scale of Chinese investments and trade in Africa are hard to come by. but according to Chinese official statistics. Chinese investment in Africa reached US $2.4 billion (flow) and US $39.9 billion (stock) in 2016. 1 During his visit to the African Union in 2014. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that by 2020. China expects to achieve US $400 billion in trade volumes with Africa and raise its direct investment in the continent to US $100 billion (Kuo. 2015).

The focus here is not simply on the food and agriculture sector; the study also aims to shed light on the Chinese migrants involved in that sector. For instance. who are they and where do they come from in China? Why do they come to Ethiopia. and how do they end up in the food and agriculture sector? How do their business networks operate? What are their aspirations. and do they see Ethiopia as a permanent home?Currently Chinese engagement in the food and agriculture sector in Ethiopia is occurring at multiple levels. At the level of official cooperation between the two states. there is a China-Ethiopia Agricultural Technology Demonstration Centre (ATDC) in Ginchi; Chinese instructors are teaching at agricultural vocational colleges; Chinese agronomists are participating in UN and other agricultural development projects; and Chinese experts are serving with the Ministry of Agriculture (Alemu 2013).

In this sector. cooling loads represent an important part of the energy consumption. and therefore. they must be minimized. improving the energy efficiency of buildings. Ventilated façades are one of the most widely used passive elements that are integrated into buildings. precisely with the aim of reducing these loads. This reduction is due to the airflow induced in the air cavity by the buoyancy forces. when the solar radiation heats the outer layer of the façade. In the open joint ventilated facades (OJVF). ventilation is attained through the open joints between the panels composing the outer layer. Despite the steadily growing research in the characterization of this type of system. few studies combine the numerical modelling of OJVF with experimental results for the assessment of the airflow in the ventilated cavities. This paper experimentally validates a numerical simulation model of an OJVF. Firstly. the façade performance has been experimentally assessed in a laboratory model determining the temperatures in the panels and air gap and measuring the flow field at the gap using particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. Secondly. a numerical model has been developed using advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation tools. Finally. an experimental validation of the numerical model has been done.

This paper aims to compare the impact of climate change on the energy performance of residential buildings in order to derive potential design strategies. Different climate file inputs of Madrid have been used to quantify comparatively the thermal needs of two reference residential buildings located in this city. One of them represents buildings older than 40 years built according to the applicable Spanish regulations prior to 1979. The other refers to buildings erected in the last decade under more energy-restrictive constructive regulations. Three different climate databases of Madrid have been used to assess the impact of the evolution of the climate in recent years on the thermal demands of these two reference buildings. Two of them are typical meteorological years (TMY) derived from weather data measured before 2000. On the contrary. the third one is an experimental file representing the average values of the meteorological variables registered in Madrid during the last decade. Annual and monthly comparisons are done between the three climate databases assessing the climate changes. Compared to the TMYs databases. the experimental one records an average air temperature of 1.8 C higher and an average value of relative humidity that is 9% lower.

However. in general TiO2 suffers from an initial irreversible capacity that limits its use in different applications. A combination of a microbead morphology. Nbdoping. and the use of an ionic liquid electrolyte is shown to significantly decrease the irreversible capacity loss. A change in the electrochemical response in the first cycles indicates formation of a solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) or a modification of the structure of the surface layer of the TiO2/Nb microbeads. which apparently stabilises the performance. The change in the response is manifested in an increased charge transfer resistance and the presence of two charge transfer contributions. During prolonged cycling the TiO2/Nb electrode shows an excellent stability over 5000 cycles. Ex situ analysis after cycling shows that the overall microbead morphology is intact and that there are no changes in the crystal structure.

Liberal backbencher Jamie Briggs incensed the research community when he released a statement vowing that the Coalition. if elected to government. would end the waste of taxpayer dollars by auditing ‘increasingly ridiculous research grants and reprioritising funding through the Australian Research Council (ARC) to deliver funds to where they’re really needed’. such as medical research. The statement singled out four humanities-based ARC-funded projects as examples of grants that ‘do little. if anything. to advance Australians research needs and funding priorities’(Briggs 2013).The statement left both scientists and social scientists nervous—not for the first time—about political influence over the direction of research funding. It also ignited renewed debate about the value. nature and role of research. While researchers and research funding agencies understand that governments have a legitimate need to prioritise spending of taxpayer dollars. there are increasing expectations that publicly-funded research should have ‘impact’beyond academia. and yield demonstrable and direct economic. environmental and social benefits.

At the same time. the need to address carbon emissions to reach global climate-change targets is becoming increasingly recognised. Plentiful deep fresh groundwater is available but is difficult. and typically uneconomical. to access due to the high costs of borehole drilling and completion. The emerging concept of ‘enhanced water recovery’ (EWR) hypothesises that carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into the deep aquifers will increase pressure. making groundwater more easily available at shallower depths across a broad region while simultaneously contributing to a reduction in CO2 emissions.

The NZE CPU was proposed to produce high purity CO {sub 2} from the oxycombustion flue gas. to achieve> 95% CO {sub 2} capture rate and to achieve near zero atmospheric emissions of criteria pollutants. Two SOx/NOx removal technologies were proposed depending on the SOx levels in the flue gas. The activated carbon process was proposed for power plants burning low sulfur coal and the sulfuric acid process was proposed for power plants burning high sulfur coal. For plants burning high sulfur coal. the sulfuric acid process would convert SOx and NOx in to commercial grade sulfuric and nitric acid by-products. thus reducing operating costs associated with SOx/NOx removal. For plants burning low sulfur coal. investment in separate FGD and SCR equipment for producing high purity CO {sub 2} would not be needed.

1302341,Nanostructured oxygen carriers for chemical looping combustion and chemical looping hydrogen production,2010,Rahul Dushyantrao Solunke,,,,,,Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an emerging technology for clean energy-production. In CLC. an oxygen carrier is periodically oxidized with air and then reduced in contact with a fuel. CLC is thus a flame-less oxy-fuel combustion without an air separation unit. producing sequestration-ready CO2-streams without significant energy penalty. However. a major hurdle towards technical implementation of CLC is the development of robust oxygen carrier materials. In this thesis. we report on a combined study of theoretical and experimental investigations of oxygen carriers for CLC. A detailed thermodynamic screening of oxygen carriers based on several comparison criteria was carried out to come up with the best candidates for CLC and then effect of sulfur contamination in the fuel stream on the performance of these selected oxygen carriers was studied. In sulfur-free streams the carriers show stable and fast reduction and re-oxidation kinetics. Sulfur contamination results not only in sulfidation of the metal carrier component. but also in partial sulfidation of the support matrix which marginally alters the redox kinetics but does not affect carrier stability. Interestingly. the support sulfidation leads to a significant increase in the oxygen carrying capacity of the carriers. Further investigation of Cu-based carriers showed that efficient desulfurization of the fuel reactor exit stream is achievable with quantitative S-recovery in the air reactor effluent. Beyond combustion. chemical looping can be used to produce hydrogen by replacing air with steam as oxidant in a 'chemical looping steam reforming' process (CLSR).

The mortars studied in this work are mixed mortars of lime and gypsum. The proportion of PCM is 0%. 10%. 20% and 30%. In order to minimize some problems associated with shrinkage and consequent cracking of the mortars. the incorporation of nylon fibers. superplasticizer and gypsum was tested. A studied of mechanical characteristics and some sensitivity tests for qualify the shrinkage of the fifteen compositions was realized. In this way. one composition for the application in tests cells was selected. with the aim of studying the thermal behaviour of these mortars. The test performed on test cells includes the study of a standard mortar without addition of PCM and a mortar with incorporation of an ideal percentage of PCM. Based on the obtained results it was possible to conclude that the incorporation of PCM microcapsules in the studied mortars causes an increase in mechanical strengths and shrinkage.

Oxford. UK,With an annual production of almost 3 Gt ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is the dominant binder of the construction industry [1]. The production of 1 t of OPC generates 0.55 t of chemical CO2 and requires an additional 0.39 t of CO2 in fuel emissions for baking and grinding. accounting for a total of 0.94 t of CO2 [2]. Other authors [3] reported that the cement industry emitted in 2000. on average. 0.87 kg of CO2 for every kilogram of cement produced. As a result the cement industry contributes about 7% of the total worldwide CO2 emissions [4]. The projections for the global demand of Portland cement show that by 2056 it will double. reaching 6 Gt/year [5]. The urge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the fact that OPC structures that have been built a few decades ago are still facing disintegration problems points out the handicaps of OPC. Portland cement–based concrete presents a higher permeability that allows water and other aggressive media to enter. leading to carbonation and corrosion problems. The early deterioration of OPC reinforced concrete structures is a current phenomenon with significant consequences both in terms of the cost for the rehabilitation of these structures. and in terms of environmental impacts associated with these operations.

Several research studies forwarded the possibility of incorporating microencapsulated PCM in plastering mortars for building façades. in pursuit of increased energy efficiency associated with the heat storage capacity of PCM. However. most of these studies are centred in the use of a single type of PCM. which is bound to be more adequate for a given season of the year (e.g. winter or summer) than for all the seasons.

Geopolymeric mortars show much higher drying shrinkage than Portland cement-based composites because they use a low amount of structural water and thus have a higher pore content than ordinary Portland cement composites. Therefore. the use of fibres is especially interesting to counteract the drying shrinkage tendency of geopolymeric mortars. This paper provides results on the restrained and unrestrained shrinkage performance of fly ash-based geopolymeric mortars reinforced with short polymer hybrid fibres (SPHF).

The assessment of plastering mortars with Phase Change Materials (PCMs) is experimentally investigated in this paper. aiming to assess the effectiveness of the PCM into the mortar. here termed as single PCM plastering mortar (SPCMM). In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PCM mortar concept. two experiments have been performed. Two small-scale cubic test cells have been constructed. with outer edge of 26 cm and inner edge of 20 cm. In regard to the outer lining of these two cells. the following applies: one of them was externally lined with conventional mortar (here termed as REFM); and another lined with single PCM plastering mortar. The cells were closed. placed inside climatic chambers and subjected to realistic temperature scenarios in South European countries. whereas the inner temperature was continuously recorded. It was shown that a smoother indoor temperature profile is obtained when PCMs are implemented. An improvement in human comfort can thus be anticipated.,True,S0nBrNQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,5,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/30853,6523096706136461811,/scholar?cites=6523096706136461811,,,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/30853/1/Guimar%C3%A3es_PCM_c%C3%A9lulas_2014.pdf,0,0,0
1302366,Thermal mortars: Contribution of the incorporation of PCM microcapsules,2012,Sandra Raquel Leite Cunha and JL Aguiar and Mohammad Kheradmand and L Bragança and VM Ferreira and António Tadeu,,,,,Istanbul Technical University,The main purpose of this work is the production of a mortar with incorporation of Phase Change Materials (PCM) microcapsules. which must have a compromise between workability. mechanical strength and aesthetic appearance. The mortars studied in this work are mixed mortars of lime and gypsum. The proportion of PCM is 0%. 10%. 20% and 30%. In order to minimize some problems associated with shrinkage and consequent cracking of the mortars. the incorporation of nylon fibers. superplasticizer and gypsum was tested. A studied of mechanical characteristics and some sensitivity tests for qualify the shrinkage of the fifteen compositions was realized. In this way. one composition for the application in tests cells was selected. with the aim of studying the thermal behaviour of these mortars. The test performed on test cells includes the study of a standard mortar without addition of PCM and a mortar with incorporation of an ideal percentage of PCM. Based on the obtained results it was possible to conclude that the incorporation of PCM microcapsules in the studied mortars causes an increase in mechanical strengths and shrinkage. The tests performed on test cells allowed to verify a time lag in maximum and minimum temperatures. as well as a slight attenuation in the temperature variation. It can be concluded that the use of PCM microcapsules in mixed mortars of lime and gypsum can be assumed as a viable solution for applications in the construction industry once these present a compromise between their resistance. aesthetic appearance and thermal behaviour.,True,S0nBrNQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,5,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/21735,12947460477807550190,/scholar?cites=12947460477807550190,,,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/21735/1/Thermal%20mortars%20Contribution%20of%20the%20incorporation%20of%20PCM%20microcapsules.pdf,0,0,0

This selected melting temperature was targeted to reduce the peak temperature developed in mortar at early ages. induced by heat of hydration of cement. Indeed. 34 °C is well above normal casting temperatures. yet well below peak temperatures normally attained in massive concrete structures: therefore. this choice would represent a somewhat generalizable choice for attenuating peak temperatures.

This is an important feature. especially in the European context. in which a circular economy and future zero waste are targeted. Still. the cost of these materials. due to the use of high purity activators. prevents their commercialization as they are simply not competitive enough.Objective:The reduction in the amount of activators could be a cost-efficient solution if the associated decrease in the mechanical properties turned not to be excessive. This means that it is important to investigate the manner in which these additives can be used on their composition in order to compensate that mechanical reduction.Results and Conclusion:This paper discloses results concerning the mixed design of fly ash based geopolymeric mixtures using metakaolin. Portland cement (OPC) and calcium hydroxide as additives. Their influence on the mechanical properties. microstructure and cost-efficiency was studied. The results showed that the use of Portland cement as an additive leads to lower compressive strength.

Such approach provides added benefits in regard to recent proposals of single PCM usage. Their application as lining of walls contributes to keep the indoor air temperature within acceptable comfort levels. and consequently reduce energy consumption associated to acclimatization. The focus was the strategy for minimizing heating/cooling energy consumption by applying mortars containing adequate proportions of PCMs with distinct melting temperatures and phase change enthalpies.

The mortars with incorporation of phase change materials (PCM) have the ability to regulate the temperature inside buildings. contributing to the thermal comfort and reduction of the use of heating and cooling equipment. using only the energy supplied by the sun. This paper aims to contribute to the study of mortars incorporating PCM. The main characteristics of the material and the mortars doped with PCM. will be presented.

1302379,Energy return on investment: toward a consistent framework,2008,Kenneth Mulder and Nathan John Hagens,37,AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment,2,74-79,Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,Numerous technologies have been proposed as partial solutions to our declining fossil energy stocks. There is a significant need for consistent metrics to compare the desirability of different technologies. The ratio of energy produced to energy consumed by an energy production technology—known as the energy return on investment (EROI)—is an important first indicator of the potential benefits to society. However. EROI analysis lacks a consistent framework and has therefore yielded apparently conflicting results. In this article. we establish a theoretical framework for EROI analysis that encompasses the various methodologies extant in the literature. We establish variations of EROI analysis in two different dimensions based on the costs they include and their handling of nonenergy resources. We close by showing the implications of the different measures of EROI upon estimating the desirability of a technology as …,True,Tfx0rIoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,182,https://bioone.org/journals/ambio-a-journal-of-the-human-environment/volume-37/issue-2/0044-7447(2008)37[74:EROITA]2.0.CO;2/Energy-Return-on-Investment-Toward-a-Consistent-Framework/10.1579/0044-7447(2008)37[74:EROITA]2.0.CO;2.short,982508314601105140,/scholar?cites=982508314601105140,,,,0,0,0

AE Farrell et al. focus in part on whether biomass-derived ethanol fuel delivers positive net energy [ie. whether energy return on energy invested (EROI) exceeds 1: 1; see (1)]. Their analysis neither resolves nor clarifies the fundamental issues that make net energy important and contentious. First. in their comparison of ethanol and gasoline. they confuse EROI—a productivity index—with the energy efficiency of an oil refinery. Second. their use of energy break-even as a litmus test is a red herring; it is more crucial that EROI is high compared with competing energy sources. Exploration for domestic petroleum in the 1930s returned 100 Joules for each Joule invested; the EROI for oil production today is~ 15: 1 (2). Because the present EROI of fossil fuels is high. the~ 90 net Quads (1 Quad=~ 1 exajoule) delivered annually to the US economy results from an investment of only about 10 Quads (2). To provide that same 90 net Quads from cornderived ethanol would require an investment of 145 to 500 Quads (based on an EROI=~ 1.6: 1 to 1.2: 1. implied by Farrell et al.’s fig. 1). The current transportation system cannot be maintained on a fuel system delivering only a 1.6: 1 return. Third. the focus on petroleum inputs is too limited. Natural gas is often the principal input to biomass fuel production. but its future is no more certain than oil’s; we already import more than 15% of what we use (3).

1302383,The influence of output variability from renewable electricity generation on net energy calculations,2014,Hannes Kunz and Nathan John Hagens and Stephen B Balogh,7,Energies,1,150-172,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,One key approach to analyzing the feasibility of energy extraction and generation technologies is to understand the net energy they contribute to society. These analyses most commonly focus on a simple comparison of a source’s expected energy outputs to the required energy inputs. measured in the form of energy return on investment (EROI). What is not typically factored into net energy analysis is the influence of output variability. This omission ignores a key attribute of biological organisms and societies alike: the preference for stable returns with low dispersion versus equivalent returns that are intermittent or variable. This biologic predilection for stability. observed and refined in academic financial literature. has a direct relationship to many new energy technologies whose outputs are much more variable than traditional energy sources. We investigate the impact of variability on net energy metrics and develop a theoretical framework to evaluate energy systems based on existing financial and biological risk models. We then illustrate the impact of variability on nominal energy return using representative technologies in electricity generation. with a more detailed analysis on wind power. where intermittence and stochastic availability of hard-to-store electricity will be factored into theoretical returns.

In this work. in order to analyze the local axial dispersion parameters. simple custom NBG (Nano Biotechnology Group) expanded bed columns with 10 and 26 mm inner diameter were modified by insertion of sampling holes. Based on this configuration. the particles and liquid can be withdrawn directly from various axial positions of the columns. Streamline DEAE particles were used as solid phase in this work. The effects of factors such as liquid velocity. viscosity. settled bed height and column diameter on the hydrodynamic parameters were investigated. Local bed voidages in different axial bed positions were measured by a direct procedure within the column with 26 mm diameter. Increasing trend of voidage with velocity at a certain position of the bed and with bed height at a certain degree of expansion was observed. Residence time distribution (RTD) analysis at various bed points showed approximately uniform hydrodynamic behavior in the column with 10 mm diameter while a decreasing trend of mixing/dispersion along the bed height at a certain degree of expansion was seen in the column with 26 mm diameter. Also lower mixing/dispersion occured in the smaller diameter column.

This paper presents the results of a study on a dual fuel (DF) engine including natural gas and diesel fuel in view of combustion and emissions parameters. The current investigation also supports by 3D-CFD simulation coupled with the chemical kinetics mechanism for detailed investigation. Based on the results. increasing the premixed ratio of natural gas from 50% to 90% causes the combustion shifts toward the expansion stroke. Therefore. the in-cylinder pressure and combustion efficiency decreases. In 90% premixed ratio of natural gas. the non-combustion condition can be observed.

With this aim. we used an electroless method for Pt surface modification. which entails the spontaneous deposition of gold at Pt electrodes. We also use a home-made fast-response (four electrodes) flow cell that allows an accurate control of the electrode exposition time to CO (tad) and of the time interval (tw) before stripping of the adsorbed CO (COad). Thus two key experimental parameters of the electro-oxidation process can be independently modified and the results evaluated. Our results are consistent with a mechanism in which CO is initially adsorbed onto active sites and then moves away by surface diffusion. As a result. the subsequent oxidative stripping elimination of CO starts with COad far away from the most active sites.

The rice crop has also been disaggregated into all its major components. e. g.. Aman. Aus. BOTQ. etc. A large number of Rabi crops have also been investigated. Elasticity estimates for group commodities. e. g. foodgrain. vegetables spices. etc. have also been obtained.

Agricultural diversiﬁcation is the next stage in transforming traditional agriculture to a dynamic. commercial sector. Diversiﬁcation in the product mix of agriculture. through a shift toward high-value products. has great potential for accelerating growth rates in production. To exploit this potential. forces within both the supply and the demand Sides of the shift are important; but demand forces (the scope of market opportunities for high-value products) play a more important role in the initial stage of the process. Robust diversiﬁcation cannot take place without exploitation of foreign demand. In low-income economies. domestic demand for high-value products such as ﬁsh. livestock products. horticultural products. and vegetables is generally low and does not have a signiﬁcant impact on agricultural growth rate through diversiﬁcation. Thus. an export-based strategy is generally the most productive route to follow. In Bangladesh rice contributes about 50 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in agriculture and 70 percent of the value of crop production. On the other hand. income elasticity of the demand for rice is low and declining overtime (see Chapter 5). Therefore. agricultural diversiﬁcation is a serious issue in the context of agricultural growth.The prospect of agricultural growth through crop diversiﬁcation raises a great many issues concerning agronomic sustainability. farm-level incentives. changing technologies. marketing efﬁciency and opportunities. comparative advantage. and macrolevel supply-demand …,True,kP2TFDgAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,16,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=S3diAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA232&dq=info:U-bxK5P6_bEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=91PywmVznl&sig=fJ0b3cmSvwHoodxIt_aZ0P_7pNU,12825682823825450579,/scholar?cites=12825682823825450579,,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=S3diAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA232&dq=info:U-bxK5P6_bEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=91PywmVznl&sig=fJ0b3cmSvwHoodxIt_aZ0P_7pNU,0,0,0
1302528,Price responsiveness of supply of major crops in Bangladesh,1993,Sultan Hafeez Rahman and Mohammad Yunus,,Bangladesh Food Policy Project Manuscript,19,,,Agricultural price policy in Bangladesh has gone through a remarkable metamorphosis over the course of the last two decades. The progress in the adoption of the new technology in crop production can largely be attributed to a set of government policies introduced in the early 1960s. These include direct government involvement in the procurement and distribution of modern agricultural inputs at highly subsidized prices. support for agricultural research and extension. and'public investment in irrigation. When chemical fertilizer was first introduced in Bangladesh in the late fifties. the policy consisted of two basic tenets: heavy subsidization with a view to promoting the use of this unfamiliar input. and complete public sector control over its procurement and distribution. This policy continued unabated unti1 the mid-1970s. However. the policy of heavy subsidy on fertilizer has been reversed with a vengeance. As a result. successive reductions of subsidy have brought about manifold increase in the price of fertilizer over these two decades (Hossain 1987). Moreover. in consort with the preqilections of the donor agencies the Bangladesh government introduced a new marketing system (NMS) in the 1977/78 whereby any person. group or'organization is allowed to register as fertilizer dealer and to trade in fertilizer anywhere in the country. Accordingly. the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADe) closed its upazilla sales centres and consolidated its sales points at major,True,kP2TFDgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,15,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.510.2215&rep=rep1&type=pdf,193718552311483783,/scholar?cites=193718552311483783,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.510.2215&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1302540,Economic Growth. Poverty and Inequality Revisited,2015,Sultan Hafeez Rahman and Hiranya Mukhopadhay,,,,,BRAC Institute of Governance and Development. BRAC University,The paper inspects the dynamics of economic growth. poverty and income inequality in different countries over the time. The experience with economic growth and inequality show that both absolute and relative inequalities in expenditure/income have increased in several Asian countries over the last decade with the growth of economy. Even though some level of poverty reduction was gained from the economic growth. the growth is more advantageous for the rich in terms of education. occupation. nutrition. health and other public policies. This inequality has increased due–to the uneven growth in some sectors and some locations; rapid increase in returns to higher education. skilled workers and employment; and the shift from a dominant socialist ideology to a more market oriented economy. Inequality not only slows down the pace of poverty reduction for a given economic growth but also is a probable threat to sustainable economic growth. However there are debates regarding the relationship between growth and inequality. especially on the form of functional relationship between them. This paper tries to estimate this relationship without imposing any a-priori restriction on the functional relationship. and so the local polynomial (nonparametric) regression is employed. World Bank’s data on Gini index concerned with average index from 2003-2007 and annual percentage of growth rate of GDP from 2008-2010 for 96 countries from Asia. Latin America. Africa and Europe were used to for this purpose. The nonparametric regression determines an inverted U-shaped relationship between inequality and growth. and the result is later confirmed by …,True,kP2TFDgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/55689158/26_Economic_Growth__Poverty_and_Inequality_Revisited__17-08-16.pdf,10873373733866248448,/scholar?cites=10873373733866248448,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/55689158/26_Economic_Growth__Poverty_and_Inequality_Revisited__17-08-16.pdf,0,0,0

Per capita income rose to US $1190 in FY2014 from under US $100 in the early 1970s and the country is almost food self-sufficient albeit enjoying modest export surplus in recent years. From a slow start in the 1970s. GDP growth rate has accelerated to around 6 percent over past decade despite natural calamities. global financial crisis and political unrest at home. Bangladesh is well on its way to attaining several MDG targets especially in social indicators in which the country has done markedly better than neighboring comparators. Bangladesh‟ s home grown economic reform measures aided by foreign assistance and democratic transition are credited with impressive economic performance since the early 1990s. Major trade and financial liberalization programs were undertaken as part of the structural adjustment reforms supported by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Adoption of current account convertibility in March 1994 and floating exchange rate system in June 2003 as part of exchange and trade system liberalization agreed with the IMF for its support under Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) respectively created conditions for improved investments including foreign direct investment (FDI). growth and balance of payment (with both exports and imports facilitation).

For instance. unexpected shortfalls in foreign exchange earnings are difficult and costly to meet. at least in the short-run. Price variability per se is not deemed harmful. but the concern is related directly to unexpected price swings. Second. the longterm decline in real purchasing power of commodity exports from the Third World is viewed as an outflow of resources.The IPC is a price stabilization-cum-indexation scheme aimed at attenuating the large swings in prices and at the same time keeping real prices constant or even raising them. by tying commodity prices to some index of inflation in the industrialized world.

1302569,Comparison of models for thermal energy storage units and heat pumps in mixed integer linear programming,2015,Thomas Schütz and Hassan Harb and Rita Streblow and Dirk Müller,,,,,,The shift towards a more sustainable energy supply relies on an increased use of renewable energy sources (RESs). such as wind energy converters and photovoltaic generation. However. the RES generation highly fluctuates. therefore requiring novel control strategies to ensure grid stability and security of energy supply. Demand side management (DSM) approaches for example are able to steer the load to match the generation. In building energy systems. heat pumps (HPs) offer a large potential for DSM. because they are commonly installed in combination with thermal energy storage (TES) units providing flexibility to shift electrical loads. Control concepts using DSM commonly result from optimization. in particular mixed integer linear programming (MILP). In these programs. TES units are usually simplified to a homogenous. thermal capacity and the heat output and electricity consumption of HPs are commonly based on predefined. nominal values neglecting actual operational conditions of the HP.In this work. the introduction of more complex models that are able to assess thermal stratification inside the storage and a heat pump model that computes the device characteristics based on resulting operational conditions are presented and compared to the simplified models. The comparison is based on a full year simulation for a residential building and involves the simplified and complex models as well as combinations of both.

1302570,A multi-agent based approach for energy management in microgrids,2014,Hassan Harb and Thomas Schütz and Rita Streblow and Dirk Müller,,Proceedings of ECOS 2014,,,,A shift to a decentralized power generation mainly based on Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) is essential to meet the climate protection goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The fluctuating generation of RESs poses challenges for the stability of the electrical grid. Therefore. energy management systems (EMSs) are essential to cope with the volatility of RESs through an intelligent coordination of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). Thus. EMSs ensure the security of energy supply and enhance the integration of RES.In this work. an energy management strategy based on a multi-agent system (MAS) for a microgrid is presented. The control strategy exploits the flexible operation of the DERs deployed in heating systems. which arises from using thermal storages. to adapt to the RESs fluctuations. This is performed by determining optimized schedules for the DERs using Mixed Integer Linear Programing (MILP) as well as thermal and electrical demand forecasting models. The coordination of the DER within the microgrid is achieved through a centralized and a decentralized approach for determining the operation schedules. Both approaches are assessed against a scenario in which the conventional heat driven operation of DERs is employed. The evaluation criteria comprise Primary Energy Consumption (PEC). reduction of CO2 emissions. operation costs and integration of RES. Both centralized and decentralized approaches achieve significant reduction in PEC and CO2 emissions compared to the heat driven scenario.

1302572,Purely Agent Based Control of Building Energy Supply Systems,2015,Max Huber and Sebastian Brust and Thomas Schütz and Ana Constantin and Rita Streblow and Dirk Müller,,,,,,Poorly designed and badly working control systems in buildings are leading to a high waste of primary energy in the building sector. In literature many approaches use agent based control (ABC) in order to facilitate the configuration of these systems and thus reduce the error rate at commissioning processes. These approaches increase the energy efficiency of buildings without any additional installation efforts. Nevertheless. the implementation of software agents is thereby usually limited to small parts of the system such as data monitoring or room temperature control. On the other hand. in the industrial sector there are already purely ABC architectures for large and complex processes. This means that no superordinate control level is needed. Thus. the advantages of ABC such as ability to plug & play of new components as well as self configuration of processes are used efficiently. This paper describes an approach to apply a purely ABC for building energy supply systems. The control system needs no pre-configuration and can be set into action without commissioning efforts. Therefore. different components of the building supply system are equipped with decentralized software agents. Each agent has a virtual cost function in order to estimate the operational costs of its corresponding component. Each agent is independently responsible for the control of its component. The agents communicate with each other and evaluate which components have to be activated in order to reach the users’ comfort conditions most efficiently.The functionality of the approach is tested in a test bench in combination with simulated components.

1302577,Adaptive model for thermal demand forecast in residential buildings,2014,Hassan Harb and Thomas Schütz and Rita Streblow and Dirk Müller,,,,,,The future smart grid comprises concepts such as microgrids and virtual power plants. A common feature of these systems is the coordination of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) ie heat pumps and combined heat and power units. according to individual constraints to achieve a shared objective. The coordination typically requires a thermal demand forecast of the dwellings. Therefore. the performance of the forecasting method is crucial for the energy management concept.We propose a time series based concept for thermal demand forecast which is characterized by an adaptive approach that requires two inputs. a forecast of the outdoor temperature and the thermal demand measurement data of the past week. The forecasting algorithm separates the heat demand into a systematic and a behavioral component. In this work. the approach and the formulation of the algorithm are presented. A comparison is made between this algorithm and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

1302578,Optimal Design of Energy Conversion Units and Building Envelopes for Residential Neighborhoods,2018,Thomas Schütz,,,,,,In recent years. many different envelopes and energy system components have evolved for application in buildings. Such modern. efficient and even renewable devices are indispensable for achieving politically motivated CO2 reductions. Furthermore. additional economic and ecological benefits can result from connecting multiple buildings via local electricity grids. The European Commission also foresees such developments as new business models. However. designing such systems requires methodical approaches that can be supported through optimization methods.Thus. this work contributes to this field by developing a thermal building model and energy system design formulations for simultaneously optimizing building envelopes and energy systems. Additionally. this work develops a decomposition method for extending these models to city districts. All approaches are formulated as multiobjective optimization for assessing economic and ecological factors. The developed building model fulfills standard tests for validating building simulation tools and leads to similar results as more detailed models. Additional verifications are conducted for individual building optimization. Furthermore. the decomposition approach is verified for two neighborhoods by comparison with the compact model formulation. Both formulations lead to similar results; however. the compact formulation is limited to at most four buildings. whereas the decomposition approach allows for scaling the models to more buildings and it converges in less computing time.,True,HW488EgAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,1,https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/755957/files/755957.pdf,15670563572475985382,/scholar?cites=15670563572475985382,,,https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/755957/files/755957.pdf,0,0,0

Typically. in exact optimization models. only energy systems are considered. whereas envelope components are neglected. When considering both. heuristics are commonly used. which do not guarantee optimal or close to optimal results. Thus. this paper presents a building model that can be used in exact optimization problems for simultaneously considering energy systems and building envelopes. The developed model is based on ISO 13790 and verified according to ASHRAE 140 and further compared to a more detailed model. The findings show that the developed model fulfills the ASHRAE requirements for heating and cooling loads. The model computes similar heat demands as the more detailed model; however. cooling loads differ. Since our focus is on heating systems. the model is suitable for this application.

Heat pumps are widespread heating devices that are typically installed together with thermal storages.

The methodology combines the advantages of metaheuristics and deterministic mixed-integer linear programming to improve the computational efficiency of the applied metaheuristic algorithm. This methodology is further investigated using a case study that comprises an apartment building and a monovalent heat pump system.

The main focus of this study was to test the use of natural color and white-painted scrap tire blocks (STBs) as insulating material in a residential building prototype (RBP) and to compare their performance with a common insulating material (polystyrene). The STBs were prepared with a simple method using isoBond adhesive and tire particles from different suppliers. The thermal conductivity and water absorption of the materials were recorded. Moreover. several statistical parameters such as range. time lag and decrement factor were analyzed. The results showed that the STBs had higher thermal conductivity than polystyrene however. the ability to maintain the interior temperatures was nearly similar. This fact was explained by the combined convection-conduction heat transfer mechanism inside STBs.

Because many reservoirs have harsh conditions of salinity. temperature and rock heterogeneity. which limit process options. a robust system with flexibility is required. Systematic experimental study of formulations capable to transport surfactant as foam at 94°C. formulated in sea water. is presented. It includes methodology to conduct core floods in sand packs using foaming surfactants and to develop “surfactant blend ratio- salinity ratio maps” using equilibrium phase behavior to determine favorable conditions for oil recovery in such floods. Mathematical model able to reproduce the foam strength behavior observed in sand packs with the formulations studied is presented. Visualization of oil recovery mechanism from matrix is realized using a model system of micro-channels surrounded by glass beads to mimic matrix and fractures respectively. The observations illustrate how components may distribute within the matrix. thereby releasing oil into the fractures. The use of chemicals to minimize adsorption is required when surfactant adsorption is important. The presence of anhydrite may limit the use of sodium carbonate to reduce adsorption of carbonates.  A methodology is presented to estimate the amount. if any. of anhydrite present in the reservoir.   The method is based on brine software analysis of produced water compositions and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis of core samples.

In one of our synthesis methods. we found that we could obtain nonequilibrium crystal structures. with acicular crystals branching bidirectionally from a denser core. Both Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction showed these crystals to be a mixture of sulfate and hydrated carbonates. We attribute the nonequilibrium morphology to coprecipitation of two salts and short synthesis time (25 min). Other aqueous synthesis conditions produced mixtures of carbonates with different morphologies. which changed depending on drying temperature (40 or 100 C). In addition to aqueous solution. we used supercritical carbon dioxide for synthesis. producing a hydrated magnesium carbonate. with a nesquehonite structure. according to X-ray diffraction. This second material has smaller pores (1.01 nm) and high surface area. Due to their high surface area. these materials could be used for adsorbents and capillary transport. in addition to their potential use for carbon capture and sequestration.

1302628,Experimental Study of Forced Convective Heat Transfer in a Coiled Flow Inverter Using TiO2–Water Nanofluids,2020,Barbara Arevalo-Torres and Jose L Lopez-Salinas and Alejandro J García-Cuéllar,10,Applied Sciences,15,5225,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The curved geometry of a coiled flow inverter (CFI) promotes chaotic mixing through a combination of coils and bends. Besides the heat exchanger geometry. the heat transfer can be enhanced by improving the thermophysical properties of the working fluid. In this work. aqueous solutions of dispersed TiO 2 nanometer-sized particles (ie. nanofluids) were prepared and characterized. and their effects on heat transfer were experimentally investigated in a CFI heat exchanger inserted in a forced convective thermal loop. The physical and transport properties of the nanofluids were measured within the temperature and volume concentration domains. The convective heat transfer coefficients were obtained at Reynolds numbers (N Re) and TiO 2 nanoparticle volume concentrations ranging from 1400 to 9500 and 0–1.5 v/v%. respectively. The Nusselt number (N Nu) in the CFI containing 1.0 v/v% nanofluid was 41–52% higher than in the CFI containing pure base fluid (ie. water). while the 1.5 v/v% nanofluid increased the N Nu by 4–8% compared to water. Two new correlations to predict the N Nu of TiO 2–water nanofluids in the CFI at Reynolds numbers of 1400≤ N Re≤ 9500 and nanoparticle volume concentrations ranges of 0.2–1.0 v/v% and 0.2–1.5 v/v% are proposed.

1302634,Effects of temperature. illumination and node position on stem propagation of Miscanthus× giganteus,2012,Nicholas N Boersma and Emily A Heaton,4,GCB Bioenergy,,680-687,,The sterile triploid Miscanthus × giganteus is capable of yielding more biomass per unit land area than most other temperate crops. Although the yield potential of M. × giganteus is high. sterility requires all propagation of the plant to be done vegetatively. The traditional rhizome propagation system achieves relatively low multiplication rates. i.e. the number of new plants generated from a single‐parent plant. and requires tillage that leaves soil vulnerable to CO2 and erosion losses.

Although a labor intensive process. rhizome propagation is the most common method for vegetatively propagating M.× giganteus. Stem propagation. investigated here. alleviates many challenges associated with rhizome production. Utilizing 30 C soil and the first five nodal stem segments increased M.× giganteus propagation rates 12 fold of reported rhizome multiplication rates. Stem propagated plants (SPs) were field–tested at three sites in Iowa. I found that established SPs and rhizome propagated plants (RPs) yielded similarly. and averaged 24.7 Mg ha-1. similar to other Midwestern trials. Previous work showed that first–year M.× giganteus exhibited poor winter survival. In contrast. I found very high (> 99%) first winter survival for both SPs and RPs. However. establishment losses for RPs and SPs were very high: 40 times greater than first winter losses. Winter survival was high in Iowa trials. but plants remained green until a killing frost; this observation is blamed for poor winter survival in early M.× giganteus trials. Here. the anecdotal assertion that first–year M.× giganteus exhibits minimal leaf senescence in the first autumn was supported quantitatively by photosynthetic and leaf N measurements.

1302661,Coordinated decentralized estimation over random networks,2014,Marzieh Nabi-Abdolyousefi,,,,105-123,Springer. Cham,In this chapter. we consider three representative problems on observability and estimation over networks in the presence of randomness. The aim of this work is to highlight that these problems. among many others. can be approached via a unified formulation. The unified formulation can subsequently be utilized for proving almost sure stability and convergence of filtering algorithms over distinct classes of random networks. More specifically. we show stability and convergence properties of random variations on the coordinated decentralized estimation using this approach. We then proceed to study the effect of the random network structure on the performance of the estimation algorithms.,True,wa9lCwEAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02429-5_9,2666248509694101838,/scholar?cites=2666248509694101838,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehran_Mesbahi/publication/224254129_Coordinated_decentralized_estimation_over_random_networks/links/0c960537e5e1e02da6000000.pdf,0,0,0
1302662,Networked Dynamic Systems: Identification. Controllability. and Randomness,2013,Marzieh Nabi Abdolyousefi,,,,,,The presented dissertation aims to develop a graph-centric framework for the analysis and synthesis of networked dynamic systems (NDS) consisting of multiple dynamic units that interact via an interconnection topology.  We examined three categories of network problems. namely. identification. controllability. and randomness. In network identification. as a sub-class of inverse problems. we made an explicit relation between the input-output behavior of an NDS and the underlying interacting network. In network controllability. we provided structural and algebraic insights into features of the network that enable external signal(s) to control the state of the nodes in the network for certain classes of interconnections. namely. path. circulant. and Cartesian networks. We also examined the relation between network controllability and the symmetry structure of the graph. Motivated by the analysis results for the controllability and observability of deterministic networks. a natural question is whether randomness in the network layer or in the layer of inputs and outputs generically leads to favorable system theoretic properties. In this direction. we examined system theoretic properties of random networks including controllability. observability. and performance of optimal feedback controllers and estimators. We explored some of the ramifications of such an analysis framework in opinion dynamics over social networks and sensor networks in estimating the real-time position of a Seaglider from experimental data.,True,wa9lCwEAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/22853,14121217812854826288,/scholar?cites=14121217812854826288,,,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/22853/NabiAbdolyousefi_washington_0250E_11369.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

1302670,Local Estimators for Spacecraft Formation Flying,2011,Nanaz Fathpour and Fred Y Hadaegh and Mehran Mesbahi and Marzieh Nabi,,,,,,A formation estimation architecture for formation flying builds upon the local information exchange among multiple local estimators. Spacecraft formation flying involves the coordination of states among multiple spacecraft through relative sensing. inter-spacecraft communication. and control. Most existing formation flying estimation algorithms can only be supported via highly centralized. all-to-all. static relative sensing. New algorithms are needed that are scalable. modular. and robust to variations in the topology and link characteristics of the formation exchange network. These distributed algorithms should rely on a local information-exchange network. relaxing the assumptions on existing algorithms. In this research. it was shown that only local observability is required to design a formation estimator and control law. The approach relies on breaking up the overall information-exchange network into sequence of local subnetworks. and invoking an agreement-type filter to reach consensus among local estimators within each local network. State estimates were obtained by a set of local measurements that were passed through a set of communicating Kalman filters to reach an overall state estimation for the formation. An optimization approach was also presented by means of which diffused estimates over the network can be incorporated in the local estimates obtained by each estimator via local measurements. This approach compares favorably with that obtained by a centralized Kalman filter. which requires complete knowledge of the raw measurement available to each estimator.,True,wa9lCwEAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,0,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20120001244,,,,,,0,0,0
1302671,Time Synchronization and Distribution Mechanisms for Space Networks,2011,Simon S Woo and Jay L Gao and Loren P Clare and David L Mills,,,,,,This work discusses research on the problems of synchronizing and distributing time information between spacecraft based on the Network Time Protocol (NTP). where NTP is a standard time synchronization protocol widely used in the terrestrial network. The Proximity-1 Space Link Interleaved Time Synchronization (PITS) Protocol was designed and developed for synchronizing spacecraft that are in proximity where proximity is less than 100.000 km distant. A particular application is synchronization between a Mars orbiter and rover. Lunar scenarios as well as outer-planet deep space mother-ship-probe missions may also apply. Spacecraft with more accurate time information functions as a time-server. and the other spacecraft functions as a time-client. PITS can be easily integrated and adaptable to the CCSDS Proximity-1 Space Link Protocol with minor modifications. In particular. PITS can take advantage of the timestamping strategy that underlying link layer functionality provides for accurate time offset calculation. The PITS algorithm achieves time synchronization with eight consecutive space network time packet exchanges between two spacecraft. PITS can detect and avoid possible errors from receiving duplicate and out-of-order packets by comparing with the current state variables and timestamps. Further. PITS is able to detect error events and autonomously recover from unexpected events that can possibly occur during the time synchronization and distribution process. This capability achieves an additional level of protocol protection on top of CRC or Error Correction Codes. PITS is a lightweight and efficient protocol. eliminating the …,True,wa9lCwEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20120001245,,,,,,0,0,0

In this article. the extent to which current technologies. products and services empower end-users to take up an active role as co-providers is evaluated. Based on a review of literature and related pilot projects. current approaches were found to be driven by technical and financial considerations. There appears to be a lack of product and service design that supports end-users in their role as co-providers in a smart grid.

The Energy Battle is designed to engage home occupants in a fun way in energy conservation via a competition with other households. The challenge enabled home occupants to gain insight in their energy consumption and actively involved them in reducing energy consumption. The energy reduction was registered online and information and tips on the online platform were given to help the participants to reduce energy consumption. The game is tested in 20 student-households in the city of Rotterdam. The evaluation of the pilot focused on behavioral changes in the short and in the long term and on the role of social interaction in the game. The Energy Battle in the Rotterdam households resulted in an average reduction of 24% in electricity consumption. Eight months later the participants indicated that only a few of the behaviors developed in the game were maintained. In interviews and questionnaires the participants indicated that the game made them more aware of energy consumption in their household and how to influence it. Additionally it affected social aspects. such as dining together to save energy and the ability to discuss a topic that otherwise was avoided.

Reinforcement of the distribution grid can solve this issue. but is costly when designed for maximum peak loads. A smart charging service for EVs in combination with a flexibility market can provide a distribution system operator (DSO) with flexibility for effective distribution grid management.With Interflex. we implement and evaluate a flexibility market as a means to match the flexibility that can be provided by EV’s to the flexibility needs of a DSO. This paper provides initial insights in the potential for flexibility of the EVs and in user experiences.

1302684,Engaging households in sustainable renovation: Exploration of a complementary approach,2013,SA Meijer and DV Geelen and V Franken and WC Kersten and MRM Crul,,,,,Delft University of Technology,One of the major challenges for sustainable resource use lies in the renovation of the existing building stock. Less than 1% of the total building stock in North-West Europe is renewed each year. which means that most gain has to be achieved by renovation of the existing building stock in combination with changes in behaviour by residents. the end-users of the buildings. Commonly used methods to stimulate and support residents in making adjustments to their homes. are mostly monodirectional. Residents then are passive receivers of information and advice. Previous research shows that active involvement and multidirectional exchange leads to better results. In line with these findings. the study presented in this paper takes approaches that are used in the field of product development for and with end-users as a starting point. These approaches. such as co-design processes. creativity techniques and vision development to come to novel ideas. appear to have characteristics that are conducive to stimulate people to make changes towards sustainable renovation. The study explored if and in what way these approaches can complement the commonly applied methods. For this purpose. a number of sessions. called 'Livinggreen Labs'. were organised. In the sessions several techniques were applied for a number of themes and with varying types of participants. The sessions were evaluated by the participants. as well as by the organisers. The findings suggest that the approach tested in this study can provide an attractive complementary way to sensitise people to the possibilities of sustainable renovation and sustainable lifestyles.

However. these transitions are seldom considered together. In this paper we argue that a technical and institutional integration around grid connected electric vehicles could lead to considerable synergy and efficiency improvements. as well as increased potential for achieving sustainability goals. The key to the integrated perspective is that the present utilization of car power-trains is on average possibly only about 5%. This implies that in effect 95% of the time these high-tech products are standing idle at a parking lot.

Therefore. energy savings obtained from heating applications play an important role in Turkey’s economy. Insulation of buildings is an important technology for saving heating energy and for a sustainable development. Despite this fact. insulation in buildings is still uncommon. The insulation materials that are commonly used have standard sizes. so one must choose between the available sizes. In this study. two common materials namely glass wool and rock wool were used. Heating loads were calculated by means of the degree-day method. For the economical analysis. the optimum insulation thickness values were calculated by life cycle method. but naturally these values did not correspond with the available thicknesses. Also. an environmental analysis was performed by using these standard and optimum values. Feasibility of these materials for commercially available sizes and for different fuel types was assessed. Two different locations were chosen. Izmir was chosen as a city representing the milder climate of the coasts and for the colder climates of the interiors Ankara was chosen. It was found that for cheap heating systems such as systems using coal the payback periods become too long and sometimes even longer than the lifetime of the insulation material.

The thermosyphon is a passive device that can operate without the need for a power source from outside and it does not have any mechanical parts. It has wide use due to these advantages. So the thermosyphon attracted many researchers. Various researches are being carried out to improve the thermal performance of the thermosyphon. In this study. the effect of the fluid charge ratio on the thermal performance of the thermosyphon was theoretically investigated. For this purpose. a thermosyphon model was created. The evaporator. condenser and adiabatic lengths of this thermosyphon with diameter of 25 mm are 2 m. 1 m and 0.1 m respectively. The working fluid for the thermosyphon was chosen as acetone and methanol. This thermosyphon model has been investigated for different fluid charge ratios (15%-90%) and different heat source temperatures (25 oC. 30 oC and 50 oC). It has been found that the increase of the fluid charge ratio has a negative effect on the heat transfer capacity of the thermosyphon. especially at low heat source temperatures. In addition. at low temperatures (25 C and 30 C) the acetone performed better heat transfer than the methanol.

Therefore. energy savings obtained from heating applications play an important role in Turkey’s economy. Insulation of buildings is an important technology for saving heating energy and for a sustainable development. Despite this fact. insulation in buildings is still uncommon. The insulation materials that are commonly used have standard sizes. so one must choose between the available sizes. In this study. two common materials namely glass wool and rock wool were used. Heating loads were calculated by means of the degree-day method. For the economical analysis. the optimum insulation thickness values were calculated by life cycle method. but naturally these values did not correspond with the available thicknesses. Also. an environmental analysis was performed by using these standard and optimum values. Feasibility of these materials for commercially available sizes and for different fuel types was assessed. Two different locations were chosen. Izmir was chosen as a city representing the milder climate of the coasts and for the colder climates of the interiors Ankara was chosen. It was found that for cheap heating systems such as systems using coal the payback periods become too long and sometimes even longer than the lifetime of the insulation material.

The energy. environmental and enviroeconomic analyzes of refrigerants have been performed for a cooling system. The energy performances of refrigerants have been made for different evaporator (between-10 oC and 5 oC) temperatures and a constant condenser (35 oC) temperature. The R134a/R1234yf (10/90) has a higher mass flow rate (26.50%) than R134a. Because R134a/R1234yf (10/90) has a lower refrigerating effect (evaporator enthalpy difference) than R134a. The R134a/R1234yf (10/90) has slightly higher compressor energy consumption (nearly 2.94%) than R134a. and so the COP of R134a has slightly (nearly 2.85%) higher than R134a/R1234yf (10/90). When compared to R134a. it is seen that the R134a/R1234yf (10/90) significantly reduces discharge temperature (about 16%). The environmental and enviroeconomic result values of R134a/R1234yf (10/90) are slightly higher than R134a. However. even the slight differences are significant to the evaluation of the environmental impact of refrigerants.

The traditional approach is the application of twelve-pulse thyristor bridges with transformers. The developments of fast switching IGBT devices permit the development of transformer-less. multi-level converters. A multi-level circuit was suggested by Limpaecher. This paper presents a detailed simulation of the proposed circuit together with the analysis of its performance. The converter consists of a set of capacitors. air core inductors and solid state switches arranged in a ladder network. In the step-up mode. the closing of solid state switches resonantly charges the capacitors in parallel through an air-cored inductor. Then solid state switches connect the capacitors in series and discharge them through an air-core inductor to the load. In the step-down mode the capacitors are charged in series and discharged in parallel. The circuit has three modes of operation in each cycle: charge. inversion. and discharge. The circuit operation is analyzed in each mode using SPICE simulations. The selection of the components is discussed and output voltage regulation is analyzed.

Most studies have used single-locus GWAS approaches. such as mixed linear model (MLM). and little is known about more efficient algorithms to implement multi-locus GWAS. Here. we report a comprehensive GWAS of 20 free amino acid (FAA) levels in kernels of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) based on 14.646 SNPs by six multi-locus models (FASTmrEMMA. FASTmrMLM. ISISEM-BLASSO. mrMLM. pKWmEB and pLARmEB). Our results showed that 328 significant quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were identified in total (38. 8. 92. 45. 117 and 28. respectively. for the above six models). Among them. 66 were repeatedly detected by more than two models. and 155 QTNs appeared only in one model. indicating the reliability and complementarity of these models. We also found that the number of significant QTNs for different FAAs varied from 8 to 41. which revealed the complexity of the genetic regulation of metabolism. and further demonstrated the necessity of the multi-locus GWAS. Around these significant QTNs. 15 candidate genes were found to be involved in FAA biosynthesis. and one candidate gene (TraesCS1D01G052500. annotated as tryptophan decarboxylase) was functionally identified to influence the content of tryptamine in vitro.

1302771,Sustainable Business Innovation of Photovoltaic Water Pumping Systems,2018,Chi Zhang,,,,,,The development of renewable energy technology provides an effective approach to replace fossil fuels for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Technological innovation and transfer are the main driving forces in promoting renewable energy usage. because of the better efficiency and economic payback under an emission reduction target. With three of the mechanisms of emission trading originating from the Kyoto Protocol. the most wildly accepted and important mechanism between developed and developing countries is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The CDM has been implemented contributing the most of the carbon trading credits. In this study. by extracting and building an exclusive database of issued Chinese CDM projects. a modified multivariable logistic regression model for technology transfer’s correlation test with 11 extended indicators was investigated for the first time. Renewable energy projects were analyzed with certified emission reduction (CER) sizes. economic development. and geographic scopes.In addition. technological innovation should also be enhanced with new business developments to demonstrate and scale up technologies for better economic and environmental performances. This doctoral thesis studied photovoltaic water pumping (PVWP) technology as a technological solution for integration with the new business model for development and co-benefits.

To avoid damaging the exhaust valve. heat must be transferred from the valve to its seat during the contact they make at the opening and closing cycle. Heat transfer rate from the exhaust valve to its seat is a function of many factors. One of the most important factors is the thermal contact conductance (TCC) between the exhaust valve and its seat. Very few researches have been done about estimation of the TCC between the exhaust valve and its seat in the past. An experimental study has been conducted to determine the TCC between two co-axial cylinders. as the exhaust valve and its seat. Furthermore. the influence of contact pressure and frequency of contact upon the TCC is studied. The results show that the TCC decreases as the frequency of contact increases.

1302790,High efficiency sub-critical carbon dioxide supplementary heat pump for low temperature climates (energy and exergy analysis),2019,M Purjam and K Goudarzi,133,Renewable Energy,,166-176,Pergamon,Nowadays heat pumps are crucial elements of air conditioning systems and still gaining popularity. but they suffer from limitations in very cold climates such as low coefficient of performance (COP) and air leaking. Recently-developed trans-critical CO2 heat pumps are proper replacements for their (H)CFC counterparts. especially in environmental concerns. but they have not answered the temperature limitations yet. The temporal solution is to bridge the temperature gap between low temperature ambient air (lower than −15 °C) and normal operating temperature of heat pump (about 0 °C) by intermediate systems such as supplementary heaters or geothermal sources.

So basically. as long as there's a road. no destination is out of reach. With BEVs however. charging may take hours. autonomy ranges are much shorter and currently. there is no widespread. international (or even interregional) public infrastructure to charge in case of emergency. That's why plugin-hybrids and range-extenders could play an important role as a transitory technology. offering high efficiency at the convenience of a conventional vehicle. This study explores this technological potential mainly in terms of well to wheel emissions. but also usability (range …,True,vfGWsFEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812029552,2474067184297289098,/scholar?cites=2474067184297289098,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812029552/pdf?md5=a507e8b36f77261baa80295cc357f655&pid=1-s2.0-S1877042812029552-main.pdf&_valck=1,0,0,0

At the same time. the energy system is expected to reduce its carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions in order to meet climate goals in line with the Paris Agreement of limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2 C compared to pre-industrial level. For Switzerland. this means specifically to replace fossil fuels in the mobility sector as well as for heating.An electricity system largely based on intermittent renewables needs temporal flexibility options buffering generation and demand. One of those flexibility options is “Power-to-X”(P2X): This term describes the electro-chemical conversion of electricity into gaseous or liquid energy carriers or industrial feedstocks. This White Paper therefore covers P2X electrochemical processes. but not the use of electricity for direct heat generation (power-to-heat). The conversion process starts with electrolysis of water (Figure 1.1). The hydrogen generated from electrolysis can either be directly used as fuel. or–in combination with CO2 from different sources–it can be further converted into synthetic fuels. such as methane or liquid hydrocarbons. Hydrogen and synthetic fuels can directly replace fossil fuels for heating. mobility or electricity generation and can thereby reduce CO2 emissions. However. one needs to consider the entire P2X conversion chain to assess how much CO2 is effectively reduced. In particular. the level of achievable CO2 emissions reduction mainly …,True,vfGWsFEAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,2,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/352294/3/Kober-et-al_2019_WhitePaper-P2X.pdf,2448061091558740851,/scholar?cites=2448061091558740851,,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/352294/3/Kober-et-al_2019_WhitePaper-P2X.pdf,0,0,0

Ihre Wirkungsmechanismen unterscheiden sich fundamental je nachdem. ob das Fahrzeug konventionell oder elektrisch angetrieben wird. Es handelt es sich einerseits um (1) den Impakt von Bremsenergierückführung und andererseits (2) um die Grössenordnung. die Frequenz und den Impakt von nichtantriebsrelevanten Lasten.Beide werden in der Praxis oft vernachlässigt. da diese sich an konventioneller Technologie orientiert.

The modelled production of individual power plants. as well as aggregated production for the entire country. are validated against historical data.

Moreover. it aims to communicate insights from engineering/natural as well as social/economic sciences to policy makers. opinion leaders and the interested public in general. It serves as a platform for reflection and synthesis of views from a variety of disciplines.In accordance with the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050 and recognizing the importance of the overarching goal of climate change mitigation. we focus on energy demand and in particular on CO2 emissons as a proxy for the overall sustainability of future mobility. The core of our analysis concentrates on road transport. as it is the dominant contributor to both energy demand and CO2 emissions of the Swiss transport sector. We focus on motorized individual transport. which accounts for about two-thirds of CO2 emissions stemming from transportation. and in selected cases. we comment on the development of the even faster growing freight transportation sector as well.

1302824,Assessment of the Marginal Emission Factor associated with Electric Vehicle Charging,2017,Giacomo Pareschi and Gil Georges and Konstantinos Boulouchos,,1st E-Mobility Power System Integration Symposium. E-Proceedings,,,,The scientific community is coming to recognize that marginal emission factors should be employed to assess the footprint of short-term interventions. There is still however disagreement on the methodologies and on the boundaries of the system to be assessed. This study argues that in an interconnected European context imports of power must be included in the calculations. Accordingly it proposes an extension of existing lean approaches taken from the literature in order to account for cross-border flows. The analysis shows that even countries with an almost carbon-free generation mix. like Switzerland. may sustain very high marginal emission factors. The application of the developed model to the case of e-mobility suggests that electric vehicles could have emissions levels comparable to modern conventional cars. The study also warns that the complexity of the system. even when simplified to a single agent. makes the effects of different charging profiles not intuitive.,True,vfGWsFEAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,1,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/200058,14204031255645207396,/scholar?cites=14204031255645207396,,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/200058/3/conf_proceeding_v1.pdf,0,0,0

The PCM is placed in the outer tube while water is passed through the inner tube. The fins are circularly placed around the inner pipe in the PCM zone considering a constant fins number. The results show significant advantages of fins addition in reducing the melting time along with a lower advantage on the solidification time.

1302872,Thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste polypropylene for recovery of valuable petroleum range hydrocarbon,2018,Pramendra Gaurh and Hiralal Pramanik,,International Journal of Research in Science and Engineering,,,,The rising in plastics demand led to the reduction of petroleum as part of non-renewable fossil fuel since plastics were the petroleum-based material. Due to its non-biodegradable nature. the plastic waste contributes major problem in Municipal Waste Management. Some alternatives that have been developed to manage plastic wastes are recycling and energy recovery method. Waste Plastics are mostly land filled or incinerated which creates environmental problems such as air pollution and soil contamination. Due to these drawbacks. the researchers have shifted their attentions to the energy recovery method to compensate the high energy demand. Polypropylene is the most common type of plastic found in municipal solid waste. Pyrolysis is a process that can effectively convert polypropylene waste into fuel. which can then be used to generate power and heat. In this research. thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of Polypropylene (PP) were investigated at reaction temperature ranging from 500 oC-800 oC for 30 min as an effective way to recycle Polypropylene and produce valuable hydrocarbons. The results showed that with the increase in temperature. the conversion rate increased. The products of the degradation mostly consist of liquid. less gas and solid residue. The maximum liquid yield of 87 wt.% was obtained at a temperature of 800 oC for thermal pyrolysis. Whereas. maximum liquid yield of 83.6 wt% at 700 oC was obtained for catalytic pyrolysis using ZSM-5 mole ratio of 30: 1. ASTM distillation.

1302873,Pyrolysis of Municipal Plastic Wastes to Valuable Liquid Hydrocarbons: An Option to Minimize Plastic Wastes Load to Environment,2016,P Gaurha and H Pramanik,,no. January,,2-7,,Plastic solid waste (PSW) presents challenges and opportunities to societies regardless of their sustainability awareness and technological advances. In this paper. recent progress in the recycling and recovery of PSW is reviewed. Plastic Waste has become an increased problem in many industrialised countries. Concern over the volumes being created has led to a number of governments introducing new legislation for its recovery as a resource. Traditional recovery methods have generally concentrated on recycling of materials or incineration for energy. The majority of polymers in waste are mainly hydrocarbon in nature and so can be used as a feedstock for the chemical industries or as a fuel. Accumulation of enormous amounts of plastic waste produced all over the world has negative implications on the environment. Pyrolysis of plastic waste could have an important role in converting this waste into economically valuable hydrocarbons. which can be used either as fuels or as feed stock in the petrochemical industry. End product yields and properties depend on the plastic waste composition. The presence of PE (polyethylene) increased alkane content. whilst PS (polystyrene) led to higher aromatic content in the end product. The presence of PP (polypropylene) favoured alkene formation. Therefore. both PS and PP increased the octane number of end product. Pyrolysis for the simultaneous generation of oils and gases can be convenient to obtain Hydrocarbons and even to recover crude petrochemicals or to generate energy from waste Plastics.

1302899,Investigation of vapor injection heat pump system with a flash tank utilizing R410A and low-GWP refrigerant R32,2012,Xing Xu,,,,,,Vapor injection technique has proven to be effective in improving heat pump system performance. especially for cooling application at high ambient and heating application at low ambient temperature conditions. Recent research on vapor injection technique has been mostly focused on the internal heat exchanger cycle and flash tank cycle. The flash tank cycle typically shows better performance than the internal heat exchanger cycle. However. the flash tank cycle control strategy is not yet clearly defined. Improper system control strategy would result in undesirable amount of liquid refrigerant injected to the compressor or poor system performance.   In this research work. a novel cycle control strategy for a residential R-410A vapor injection flash tank heat pump system was developed and experimentally investigated. The proposed cycle control strategy utilizes an electronic expansion valve (EEV) coupled with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for the upper-stage expansion and a thermostatic expansion valve (TXV) for the lower-stage expansion. and applies a small electric heater in the vapor injection line to introduce superheat to the injected vapor thus providing a control signal to the upper-stage EEV. The proposed control strategy functions effectively for both transient and steady-state operating conditions.

Results show that there is a strong disutility associated with the least efficient properties and that renters will pay significantly more for efficiency improvements at the lower end of the efficiency scale.

We test this hypothesis by adding 5-year consumption cost labels to the tumble dryer lineup of four outlets of an Irish electrical retailer. Although we observe a reduction in the average energy consumption of dryer sales. our analysis does not show a statistically significant effect.

1302936,An Examination of the contribution of off-farm income to the viability and sustainability of farm households and the productivity of farm businesses,2007,Jasmina Behan and James Carroll and Thia Hennessy and Mary Keeney and Carol Newman and Mark O'Brien and Fiona Thorne,,,,,Teagasc,The number of farm households in Ireland participating in the off-farm labour market has increased significantly in the last decade. According to the National Farm Survey (NFS). the number of farm households where the spouse and/or operator is working off-farm has increased from 37 per cent in 1995 to 58 per cent in 2007. The important contribution of non-farm income to viability of farm households is highlighted in the results of the Agri-Vision 2015 report. which concluded that the number of economically viable farm businesses is in decline and that a significant proportion of farm households are sustainable only because of the presence of off-farm income. Research conducted by Hennessy (2004) demonstrated that approximately 40 percent of farm households have an off-farm income and that almost 30 percent of the farming population are only sustainable because of off-farm income. Clearly. the future viability and sustainability of a large number of farm households depends on the ability of farmers and their spouses’ to secure and retain gainful off-farm employment. The Department of Agriculture. Fisheries and Food (DAFF) have recognised the importance of off-farm income to the sector and they have recommended that future policies focus on farm household viability in all its dimensions. including farm and off-farm income sources (2000).,True,aMH0gjoAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,19,http://t-stor.teagasc.ie/handle/11019/895,5676869481526488145,/scholar?cites=5676869481526488145,,,https://t-stor.teagasc.ie/bitstream/handle/11019/895/eopr-5490.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

1302938,Reducing electricity demand through smart metering: The role of improved household knowledge,2013,James Carroll and Seán Lyons and Eleanor Denny,,,,,Department of Economics. Trinity College,The international rollout of residential smart meters has increased considerably in recent years. The improved consumption feedback provided. and in particular. the installation of inhouse displays. has been shown to significantly reduce residential electricity demand in the majority of international trials. This paper attempts to uncover the underlying household motivations of such information-led reductions by exploring the effect of feedback on the level of electricity reducing knowledge and the role of knowledge improvements in demand reductions. Data is from a randomized controlled smart metering trial (Ireland) which also collected extensive information on household attitudes towards and knowledge of (stated) electricity use. Results show that feedback significantly improves a household’s knowledge but such improvements are not correlated with observed demand reductions. Increasing the level of knowledge ceteris paribus is therefore unlikely to bring short-run demand reductions in residential electricity markets. The true underlying demand-reducing motivations in smart metering trials are hypothesized. a Department of Economics. Trinity College Dublin b Electricity Research Centre. University College Dublin.

1302940,Understanding SME interest rate variation across Europe,2016,James Carroll and Fergal McCann,,Quarterly Bulletin Articles,,60-76,Central Bank of Ireland,The cost of credit for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) differs considerably across the EU. This research begins by exploiting firm-level survey data to test whether differences in the characteristics of borrowing SMEs can explain cross-country variation in the cost of credit on new lending in 2014 and 2015. We find that new overdraft interest rates across the EU are lower for larger and older firms. and for those experiencing recent improvements in trading performance. However. controlling for such characteristics does not. in general. explain much of the overall difference in interest rates across countries. We extend the analysis by examining whether cross-country interest rate variation is associated with differences in the following key factors: banking sector cost efficiency; institutional factors relating to recoverability of collateral; existing and predicted default rates on SME lending; competition in the banking sector; banking sector risk and cost of funds; general macroeconomic performance. Using simple univariate correlations. we observe a significant positive relationship between interest rates and past/predicted SME loan defaults. and a negative relationship with the level of bank competition. Interest rates are also higher where banking stress is high and where unemployment is above historical levels. We find no correlation with banking sector profit/cost ratios. the cost of funds. or the efficiency of the insolvency system.,True,aMH0gjoAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,12,https://ideas.repec.org/a/cbi/qtbart/y2016m03p60-76.html,14575714027296204715,/scholar?cites=14575714027296204715,,,,0,0,0

An unbalanced panel dataset of 772 specialised dairy farms surveyed between 1996 and 2005 is analysed using a stochastic production frontier approach.

Households can contribute to the new low carbon economy by switching to more energy efficient vehicles. In addition to societal and environmental benefits. such a change should lead to private benefits for households through lower energy expenses. while avoiding the perceived costs that could accompany a modal change in personal transportation (switching away from cars). This paper uses a discrete choice experiment (stated preference) to explore the effects of using alternative fuel cost labels on the demand for more efficient cars. Results show that reframing from fuel consumption (litres) to monthly fuel costs increases the willingness to pay for higher levels of fuel efficiency.

To date. domestic or international evidence on this topic has been extremely sparse. Using data from the Red C / Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey. we show that one third of successful finance applications in Ireland from September 2012 to 2014 have a PG attached. with the most recent data suggesting that this rate was decreasing in 2014. Consistent with banks using PGs as a deterrent to default for borrowers perceived to be riskier. we find that PG usage is higher for new loans to smaller firms (in terms of both employment and turnover). younger firms. innovative firms. non-exporting firms and firms that made a loss in the previous six months. PGs are more prevalent among higher-value loans. suggesting PGs may also be used to reduce potential Loss Given Default. We also find that firms in the construction and wholesale/retail sector are most likely to have a PG attached to new lending. Finally. we find strong evidence that PGs are used in tandem with other forms of tangible business collateral such as land. buildings. machinery and other assets.,True,aMH0gjoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,4,https://ideas.repec.org/p/cbi/ecolet/06-el-15.html,4406430999196675247,/scholar?cites=4406430999196675247,,,,0,0,0

London,Ireland has a long history of philanthropy. rooted in a strong religious tradition. In the late 1700s. Protestant philanthropy helped to alleviate the physical and medical needs of the impoverished working classes (Kelly & Powell. 2010). Beginning in 1770. the incremental waning of the Penal laws1 enabled the growth of Catholic charities (Raughter. 1997). Following Catholic emancipation in 1829. greater Catholic clergy involvement in charitable activity emerged with religious involvement in philanthropy becoming more formalized in Irish society. The introduction of the Poor Laws to Ireland in 1838. which brought into existence a statutory relief system for the destitute. however. led to a fall off in charitable donations and resulted in some charities ceasing to operate thereafter (Cousins. 2008).

1302946,The determinants of charitable donations in the republic of Ireland,2005,James Carroll,,,,,Technological University Dublin,This thesis explores the variable that affect the probability of donating and the variables that affect the size of donation by Irish households. The datasets employed are the Irish Household Budget Surveys. 1994/1995 and 1999/2000. which are analysed using a tobit model and a double-hurdle model with an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation. Between 1994 and 2000. Ireland witnessed a remarkable and well-documented economic boom. This thesis provides insight into how the determinants of charitable donations change in an economy such as the Republic of Ireland’s. which has undergone such rapid economic and cultural changes. To date there has been no prior econometric study of charitable donations carried out in the Republic of Ireland. In the late 1990s. charitable donations by Irish households did not keep pace with the booming economy. Although donations have increased by 18 per cent from 1994 to 1999. GDP grew by around 93 per cent for the same period. The average charitable donation as a percentage of disposable income has decreased from 0.79 per cent in 1994 to 0.54 per cent in 1999/2000. this thesis attempts to provide some insight into the characteristics that lead to charitable giving and presents a snapshot of the most probable and generous donors in 1994/1995 and 1999/2000.

The new type of wall system consists of a composite panel with three functional layers. The external layer consists of conventional building materials impregnated with phase change materials (PCMs) and the internal layer consists of thermal insulation. Using two different types of PCMs with different values of the melting point a more effective management of the heating/air conditioning energy is achieved. A finite difference time-space discretization scheme was used in solving the transient heat conduction equation. A simplified model of PCMs’ thermal properties variation with temperature was considered neglecting effects such as supercooling and hysteresis. It was found that the layers of building material impregnated with PCMs contribute to attenuation of indoor temperature fluctuations and reduce the heating and cooling loads.

Engineering Series,,66-70,,Sulphur oxide removal from flue gas is a legal requirement for any large capacity combustion equipment. The paper presents the case of thermal power plant Rovinari (Romania). where Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization with limestone slurry has been implemented in order to reduce the SO2 concentration from 4000 mg/m3 to 400 mg/m3 (legal limit). The operation and sulfur oxides removal performance of the desulfurization system depend on a set of given design parameters value. which. in practice. cannot be fully controlled. One such factor is the quality of the coal. which is a parameter with high and random variability. Improper processing of the coal before being delivered to the burners causes incomplete combustion. which results in loss of combustible mass. Incomplete combustion means that some coal particles do not burn at all (100% loss) while others undergo a partial combustion but fall into the bottom ash collecting and transport system before complete combustion can take place.

In particular. a complication that arises is that wind generation is highly variable (stochastic) and non-dispatchable. thus making it difficult to guarantee that the load and generation remain balanced at each instant. This uncertainty of wind generation impacts decision making at various system levels. and mischaracterizing the uncertainty can lead to spilt generation. In this work. the supply-side uncertainty is investigated by developing a realistic Markov chain model for wind generation forecasting.

With information on the instantaneous states of the channels. multiuser diversity can be tapped by opportunistic multiuser scheduling. It is important that the channel state information is acquired in a cost-effective way so that the losses involved in this operation do not offset the gains promised by opportunistic scheduling. For various network environments of practical interest. this dissertation models the radio frequency links with memory. and studies the modalities to exploit the channel memory to simultaneously estimate channel state information. while performing opportunistic multiuser scheduling. The data transmission at any point of time is shown to be associated with two potentially contradicting objectives: opportunistic scheduling for immediate gains and channel exploration for future gains. Thus the joint scheduling problem is a dynamic program. specifically a partially observable Markov decision process that is traditionally known to be intractable or computationally expensive to implement.

1303012,Climate Policy Changes in Germany and Japan,2011,Rie Watanabe,,,,,,Climate change is one of the greatest challenges currently facing society. Despite acknowledged uncertainties. the overwhelming majority of scientists view it as highly probable that climate change results from anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG). and that a significant reduction in GHG emissions is imperative if dangerous climatic shifts are to be prevented (cf. IPCC 2007a. 2007c). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). which was established to review scientific information on the various components of climate change comprehensively. global GHG emissions must be halved by 2050 in order to head off potentially severe climatic threats resulting from increasing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. including a rising global mean temperature (IPCC 2007c). For this goal to be achieved. industrialized countries must collectively reduce their GHG emissions by 80 to 95 per cent from the current level by 2050. even if developing countries substantially reduce their emissions by approximately 15 to 30 per cent (den Elzen and Höhne 2008) from business-as-usual levels (IPCC 2007c: 776).On the one hand. since there is at present no viable substitute for fossil fuels to drive our daily economic activity. placing limits on emissions of GHG. and particularly of CO2. poses a fundamental challenge to a traditional basic common value: economic prosperity. in the sense of continual growth in the quantity of goods and services produced and ever-increasing enjoyment of the material wellbeing that society has pursued since the Industrial Revolution.

Pollution control agreements between local government and private industry have a proven record over 30 years as they have been extensively used to supplement national and local legislation while adapting to local conditions. They have played unique. positive roles for facilitating voluntary actions of industries. especially in the control of conventional air and water pollution in local areas. although there remain several unsettled questions concerning legitimacy and transparency of the discretional use of this approach by local government.

1303017,The development of climate change policy in Germany,2004,Lutz Mez Rie Watanabe,,International Review for Environmental Strategies,,,Institute for Global Environmental Strategies,Germany is the leader among countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in reducing its emissions of the Kyoto basket of greenhouse gases (GHGs). having accomplished an emissions reduction of 18.9 percent from 1990 to 2000. This paper aims to explain the reasons for this success and to examine the impacts of the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol on the development of Germany’s climate policy. In order to identify the factors that determined this outcome. we divide our examination of the policy process in Germany since 1987 into five periods and will evaluate it with a focus on policy measures implemented and actors as well as the institutions involved. It concludes that domestic factors. including the participation of the Greens in the coalition government. mainly determined Germany’s success in developing advanced climate policies and measures to reduce its GHG emissions. The paper also highlights the importance of the linkage of climate policy with other policies. which provided incentives to those who would otherwise have opposed or remained neutral on the development of climate policy. As such. the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol did not have a direct impact on climate policy development in Germany. but it did have an indirect impact in that it triggered the development of common and coordinated policies and measures at the European Union (EU) level in order to achieve its quantified GHG reduction target of 8 percent committed to under the Kyoto Protocol. as seen in the introduction of an EU-wide emissions trading scheme.,True,ulJPY80AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,16,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1037.3689&rep=rep1&type=pdf,4933905627431876814,/scholar?cites=4933905627431876814,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1037.3689&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Hung and Ahmad RT Nugraha and Teng Yang and Zhidong Zhang and Riichiro Saito,125,Journal of Applied Physics,8,082502,AIP Publishing LLC,We theoretically investigate a possibility of improving the thermoelectric performance of monolayer InSe through convergence of multivalley energy bands. in which some distinct valleys become almost degenerate. The convergence of energy bands is achieved by applying mechanical strain. We find that the thermoelectric power factor of monolayer InSe can be significantly enhanced by nearly a factor of 3 through the band convergence in both valence (p-type) and conduction (n-type) bands under a biaxial compressive stress of about 1.16 GPa. However. the maximum enhancement of the figure of merit Z T in the p-type and n-type InSe differs each other depending on how the valleys converge in each case. The optimal scenario is that the heavy valleys approach the light valleys in the band convergence. which leads to an increase in the power factor and. at the same time. a decrease in the thermal conductivity of …,True,7O6Qq_kAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,14,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5040752,5449211937192954050,/scholar?cites=5449211937192954050,,,,0,0,0

In contrast to predicting “smaller is stronger and more elastic” in nanomaterials. the strength of the SWNTs is significantly reduced when decreasing the tube diameter. The results obtained show that the Young’s modulus E significantly reduced in the ultra-small SWNTs with the diameter less than 0.4 nm originates from their very large curvature effect. while it is a constant of about 1.0 TPa. and independent of the diameter and chiral index for the large tube.

1303064,Thermoelectric properties of carbon nanotubes,2019,Nguyen T Hung and Ahmad RT Nugraha and Riichiro Saito,12,,23,4561,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Thermoelectric (TE) material is a class of materials that can convert heat to electrical energy directly in a solid-state-device without any moving parts and that is environmentally friendly. The study and development of TE materials have grown quickly in the past decade. However. their development goes slowly by the lack of cheap TE materials with high Seebeck coefficient and good electrical conductivity. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are particularly attractive as TE materials because of at least three reasons:(1) CNTs possess various band gaps depending on their structure.(2) CNTs represent unique one-dimensional carbon materials which naturally satisfies the conditions of quantum confinement effect to enhance the TE efficiency and (3) CNTs provide us with a platform for developing lightweight and flexible TE devices due to their mechanical properties. The TE power factor is reported to reach 700–1000 μ W/m K 2 for both p-type and n-type CNTs when purified to contain only doped semiconducting CNT species. Therefore. CNTs are promising for a variety of TE applications in which the heat source is unlimited. such as waste heat or solar heat although their figure of merit Z T is still modest (0.05 at 300 K). In this paper. we review in detail from the basic concept of TE field to the fundamental TE properties of CNTs. as well as their applications. Furthermore. the strategies are discussed to improve the TE properties of CNTs. Finally. we give our perspectives on the tremendous potential of CNTs-based TE materials and composites.

The (6. 6) SWNT bundle also exhibits a low-symmetry and opens an energy band gap of about 0.41 eV around the charge neutral condition. which allows a semiconductor-to-metal transition in the electron-doping regime when the relative shift of the Fermi energy goes up to 0.60 eV. above which the …,True,7O6Qq_kAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,9,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622317302774,1352088790185743407,/scholar?cites=1352088790185743407,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02054,0,0,0

We find that the gapless 2D Dirac material exhibits poorer thermoelectric performance than the gapped one. This fact arises due to the cancelation effect from electron-hole contributions to the transport quantities. Opening the bandgap lifts this cancelation effect. Furthermore. there exists an optimal bandgap for maximizing figure of merit ( Z T) in the gapped 2D Dirac material. The optimal bandgap ranges from 6 k B T to 18 k B T. where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the operating temperature in kelvin. This result indicates the importance of having narrow gaps to achieve the best thermoelectrics in 2D systems. Larger maximum Z Ts can also be obtained by suppressing the lattice thermal conductivity.

The ionic ordering of NaxMo3S11 in the ground-state structures is determined by the DFT method. During the intercalation process of Na ions. we find that the NaxMo3S11 structure exhibits a two-step reaction pathway involving both cationic and anionic redox reactions for Mo and S. respectively. In the first step. an initial anionic redox (S2)2– → S2– (1 ≤ x ≤ 4) occurs. while in the second step. both anionic and cationic redoxes of (S2)2– → S2– and Mo4+ → Mo3+ (4 < x ≤ 17) occur simultaneously. In total. the NaxMo3S11 electrode can store up to 17 Na ions with a predicted capacity of 711 mA h/g. Moreover. a semiconductor-to-metal transition is observed during the cationic/anionic redox due to the appearance of mid-gap states.

However. most decision makers are incapable of planning over the century-scale time horizons for which global climate models (GCMs) are developed. Even the most forward-looking actors rarely consider scenarios more than several decades into the future. The mismatch in model design and practical demands poses a challenge in extracting useful information on the decadal scale from global climate change models. Here. we explore options and limitations in generating decadal water supply change projections. as evaluated for the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct project's estimates of future change in water stress.

In order to limit the increase in future risk. or even reduce coastal flood risk. adaptation is necessary. Here. we present a framework to evaluate the future benefits and costs of structural protection measures at the global scale. which 15 accounts for the influence of different flood risk drivers (namely: sea-level rise. subsidence. and socioeconomic change). Globally. we find that the estimated expected annual damage (EAD) increases by a factor of 150 between 2010 and 2080. if we assume that no adaptation takes place.

Microsized Cu (~5 μm) and Sn (~10 μm) powders were mixed at its ratio of 45 : 55 wt.%. respectively. and then deposited onto a silicon substrate. forming an IMC layer. The actual composition of the deposited film was measured to be at a Cu : Sn ratio of 36 : 64 wt.% (in situ kinetically sprayed at 200°C). This kinetically sprayed process uses the energy source of collision and heat energy simultaneously. leading to the formation of an IMC phase. The IMC phase of Cu6Sn5 was formed successfully within 3 minutes of in situ deposition. Moreover. we obtained a Cu6Sn5 phase when the thin film was annealed in a furnace for 1 hour immediately after kinetically spraying at room temperature. However. an IMC phase was not formed in the thin film when kinetically sprayed at room temperature followed by heating on a hot plate for 3 minutes. It seems that the simultaneous supply of collision and heat energy is crucial to result in phase formation.

These hybrids are formed at room temperature using sonication. and were shown to be effective for photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under irradiation with visible light. The hybrid samples resulted in a significant increase in photocatalytic activity compared with single-component samples of g-C₃N₄. In particular. the g-C₃N₄/CNTs/Au hybrids exhibited an exponential increase in the photocatalytic activity by a factor of almost 40. Structural and compositional analyses show the successful formation of ternary g-C₃N₄/CNTs/Au hybrids. The SPR due to the Au nanoparticles led to high optical absorbance. and the inclusion of the CNTs led to effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers. resulting in substantial improvement of the photocatalytic properties. PEC measurements indicate effective use of charge carriers. and open-circuit voltage decay measurements demonstrated increased lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers in the hybrid samples. The ternary g-C₃N₄/CNTs/Au sample resulted in a large specific surface area. providing a large number of active sites for the adsorption of organic molecules.

1303164,Evanescent Photosynthesis: A New Approach to Sustainable Biofuel Production,2012,Matthew Ooms,,,,,,Immobilization of photosynthetic cultures has been used to generate biofuels and high value compounds through direct conversion of CO2 and water using sunlight.  Compared with suspended cultures. immobilized bacteria can achieve much higher densities resulting in greater areal productivity.  Limitations exist however. on the density that can be reached without compromising access to light and other nutrients.    In this thesis an optofluidic approach to overcoming the challenge of light delivery to high density cultures of cyanobacteria is described and proof of concept experiments presented.  This approach uses optical waveguides to deliver light to cells through bacterial interaction with the evanescent field and is tailored to meet each cell's need for light and nutrients.  Experiments presented here demonstrate biofilm proliferation in the presence of evanescent fields.  Illumination of surfaces by surface plasmon enhanced evanescent fields is also shown to be an effective and potentially useful technique to grow biofilms within optofluidic architectures.,True,R3Yj-IAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/33484,5472231684649417110,/scholar?cites=5472231684649417110,,,,0,0,0

1303167,Applied Plasmonics for the Cultivation and Study of Photosynthetic Microorganisms,2016,Matthew David Ooms,,,,,,This thesis explores nano-scaled plasmonic solutions to the problem of light capture and distribution in microalgae cultivation schemes.  An evaluation of the effect of light quality on productivity under different photobioreactor geometries shows a 2x increase in productivity under 630-nm red light for low density cultures under low light intensity. compared to 534-nm green light.  The opposite was true however when high density cultures are exposed to high intensity light â   534-nm performed 4x better than strongly ab-sorbed 630-nm red light.  These results highlight the coupled influence of light quality and conventional photobioreactor design parameters.  Wavelength specific. near-field plasmonic phenomena are then used as a means to couple light into cyanobacteria biofilms showing that plasmonic fields can be used to drive photosynthesis in living cells.  10-Âľm thick biofilms with maximum cell volume density of 20% vol/vol (2% more total accumulation than control experiments with direct light) were cultivated over three days.  Far-field plasmonic phenomena were also applied to bulk cyanobacteria cultures to demonstrate a 6.5% enhancement in productivity. Resonant light is scattered back towards the culture increasing total ab-sorption while off-resonance light is transmitted.  Supporting technology that enables patterning of plas-monic nano-features with a commercial CO2 laser system is also presented. Patterning speeds of 30 mm2/min and patterning costs of $0.10/mm2 are demonstrated which are ~30 fold faster and ~400 fold less expensive than e-beam lithography.

1303173,ted,,Matthew D Ooms and Percival J Graham and Brian Nguyen and Edward H Sargent and David Sinton,,,,,,The spectral distribution of light influences microalgae productivity; however. development of photobioreactors has proceeded largely without regard to spectral optimization. Here we use monochromatic light to quantify the joint influence of path length. culture density. light intensity and wavelength on productivity and efficiency in Synechococcus elongatus. The productivity of green light was~ 4 x that of red at the highest levels of culture density. depth and light intensity. This performance is attributed to the combination of increased dilution and penetration of this weakly absorbed wavelength over a larger volume fraction of the reactor. In contrast. red light outperformed other wavelengths in low-density cultures with low light intensities. Low density cultures also adapted more rapidly to reduce absorption of longer wavelengths. allowing for prolonged cultivation. Taken together. these results indicate that. particularly for artificially lit photobioreactors. wavelength needs to be included as a critical operational parameter to maintain optimal performance.

It provides guidelines for the selection of heat sources and sinks which maximize the benefit derived from the trigeneration while respecting the process constraints and the operating requirements of the turbine and heat pump. The trigeneration unit consists of a steam turbine. a power generator and an absorption heat pump driven by the steam discharge from the turbine. The methodology is applied to the implementation of a unit in a kraft pulping process. It is first illustrated by considering the two components of the trigeneration individually. The retrofit implementation of a complete unit in the spent liquor concentration section of the process is then performed. It is shown that substantial energy gains could be made through the implementation of trigeneration.,True,fxT-73YAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,17,https://www.academia.edu/download/51873887/26_marinova_m_jean_paris_.pdf,404663961283448521,/scholar?cites=404663961283448521,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51873887/26_marinova_m_jean_paris_.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Integration of absorption heat pumps (AHP) in industrial processes has not yet been fully exploited due to the lack of clear implementation guidelines for this technology. In this work. a systematic methodology for the integration of AHPs in a process has been developed and is presented. Guidelines are formulated for the proper selection of heat sources and sinks that will maximise the benefit derived from heat pumping while respecting process constraints and operating requirements of the AHP. The principles of AHP operation and its efficient process integration are thus described. The methodology relies on data extracted from a Pinch Analysis of the plant. The advantages and outputs of the methodology are illustrated using an AHP implementation in a Kraft pulping process.

Différentes options sont possibles pour réduire l’utilisation de l’énergie en milieu industriel. Les mesures proposées incluent l’intégration de pompes à chaleur. la cogénération de puissance et de chaleur. l’utilisation de différents combustibles. des opérations unitaires plus efficaces et l’augmentation de la récupération de l’énergie par échange de chaleur. Les pompes à chaleur (PC) sont des technologies de conversion de l’énergie qui sont utilisées pour augmenter la qualité de l’énergie en augmentant la température à laquelle celle-ci est disponible.

1303228,Natural resource industries and the state in collaborative approaches to water governance: a power-based analysis,2015,Marie Claire Brisbois,,,,,University of Waterloo,Collaboration is predicated upon inclusive. equitable deliberation and decision-making amongst state. private and civil actors. Through pooling of knowledge and resources. participants are expected to share knowledge and to develop effective and mutually acceptable solutions to water problems. This approach is increasingly being used by governments to support and enable water governance at regional and watershed scales. However. the ability of collaboration to generate improved social and environmental outcomes can be undermined by power imbalances interacting at individual. watershed. state. and global scales. These imbalances are particularly apparent when natural resource industries participate in collaborative processes. Influential economic actors often have the capacity to exert influence at multiple scales in ways not available to most other actors. Industry actors are also systemically privileged in environmental policy-making due to the nature of dominant socioeconomic systems. The ways in which powerful natural resource industry actors use and affect collaborative approaches to water governance have not yet been satisfactorily explained and accounted for in the literature. More broadly. the role and function of power in general represents an incomplete area of understanding with respect to collaboration for water governance.

RECs are majority owned by local members or shareholders who are authorized to share energy within the community. offering the potential to unlock private investment and financing for renewable energy sources and provide social benefits. However. successful implementation and a just energy transition requires the coupling of technological solutions with good governance. based on sound analysis. and knowledge of engineering. spatial planning. and social science. We argue that financing and ownership models that address renewable energy complementarity. spatial organization of resource potential. demographics. pushback from incumbents. and inclusion of traditionally marginalized groups. are common issues across all Member States that are crucial for the transposition of RED II and a just energy transition.

As energy sources shift and technology evolves. electricity governance is shifting from largely centralized models to include multiple decentralised and multi-level sites not bounded in their operations by established democratic processes. New forms of accountability are required to ensure that multi-level electricity systems meet societal needs and expectations. While multi-level governance dynamics are new for many electricity systems. they are common across other resources (eg water). This article uses an OECD framework that synthesizes decades of research on multi-level natural resource governance to describe 12 principles for “good” resource governance. These principles are developed and applied to decentralising electricity governance contexts in order to develop mechanisms. and identify potential governance gaps. that are relevant for ensuring accountability in decentralised electricity governance systems.

Netherlands Abstract: Modern energy systems have tended towards centralized control by states. and national and multinational energy companies. This implicates the power of elites in realizing low-carbon transitions. In particular. low-carbon transitions can create. perpetuate. challenge. or entrench the power of elites. Using a critical lens that draws from geography. political science. innovation studies. and social justice theory (among others). this article explores the ways in which transitions can entrench. exacerbate. reconfigure or be shaped by “elite power.” It does so by offering a navigational tool that surveys a broad collection of diverse literatures on power. It begins by conceptualizing power across a range of academic disciplines. envisioning power as involving both agents (corrective influence) and structures (pervasive influence). It then elaborates different types of power and the interrelationship between different sources of power. with a specific focus on elites. including conceptualizing elite power. resisting elite power. and power frameworks. The Review then reviews recent scholarship relevant to elite power in low-carbon transitions—including the multi-level perspective. Michel Foucault. Anthony Giddens. Karl Marx. and other contextual approaches—before offering future research directions. The Review concludes that the power relations inherent in low-carbon transitions are asymmetrical but promisingly unstable.

Finally in a c-power spanner. the total energy consumed on such a path. where the energy is given by the sum of the squares of the edge lengths on this path. must be at most c-times the square of the geometric distance of the direct link.While it is known that any c-spanner is also both a weak C 1-spanner and a C 2-power spanner (for appropriate C 1.C 2 …,True,wSYacHcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,14,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30551-4_69,16581026436884735097,/scholar?cites=16581026436884735097,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.211.5637&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1303252,Directed power-variable infrared communication for the mini robot khepera,2003,Matthias Grünewald and Ulrich Rückert and Christian Schindelhauer and Klaus Volbert,,Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on autonomous minirobots for research and edutainment,,,,Communication facilities are important in Robotics if several robots have to work together. In this paper. we describe problems and solutions encountered while de-signing an infrared-based communication device for the mini robot Khepera. In contrast to traditional omnidirectional systems. it features directed. power-variable transmission in eight directions at 23.4 kbps up to a range of 1m. It can differentiate incoming data sig-nals from interference from adjacent sectors and can estimate their direction-of-arrival. We model the transmission over the infrared channel and show how interference influences the reception of the data signals. We also describe methods how to reduce these effects. We have tested the performance of the resulted signal processing in a worst case scenario by simulations and in experiments with a prototype implementation. The resulted module is especially suited for experimental evaluation of ad hoc network protocols and for position estimation.,True,wSYacHcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,14,https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/record/2288637,748208959501532488,/scholar?cites=748208959501532488,,,,0,0,0
1303253,A simulation environment for ad hoc networks using sector subdivision,2002,Klaus Volbert,,,,419-426,IEEE,A new model for communication in MANET is presented: Instead of omnidirectional transmissions. as assumed in most papers and all existing systems. the members are allowed to submit data in a fixed number of different directions (sector subdivision) and to adjust the transmission power in each sector separately. A simulation environment (simulation environment for ad hoc networks. SAHNE) is presented that allows simulation of communication strategies in MANET that use sector subdivision. and simulation results are shown where communication paths are selected via hop-minimization or geometric spanner properties. SAHNE is based on C++ and common libraries. which ensures that it can be used on many different platforms. The experiments show the influence of different parameters in realistic scenarios. and using geometric routing seemed to be better than using hop-minimization.,True,wSYacHcAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,13,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/994324/,13447025318024311070,/scholar?cites=13447025318024311070,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.211.5950&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

UCS,9,1292-1311,,Multiple hop routing in mobile ad hoc networks can minimize energy consumption and increase data throughput. Yet. the problem of radio interferences remain. However if the routes are restricted to a basic network based on local neighborhoods. these interferences can be reduced such that standard routing algorithms can be applied.We compare different network topologies for these basic networks. ie the Yao-graph (aka. Θ-graph) and some also known related models. which will be called the SymmY-graph (aka. YS-graph). the SparsY-graph (aka. YY-graph) and the BoundY-graph.

Biofuels with different structure. such as paraffins. branched monocycloalkanes. and polycycloalkanes. and the feedstock including pinenes and lignocellulose-derived platform molecules such as cyclic ketones/alcohols. furanic aldehydes/alcohols. aromatic oxygenates. etc. are covered.

Specially. the properties of typical biofuels are summarized to discuss the effect of molecular structure. Increasing the number of the ring in fuel molecular improves the fuel density. with undesirable variation in low-temperature properties. Fortunately. introducing the branched chain will improve the low-temperature properties.

The propulsion performance of the engine is deeply dependent on the fuel properties. including density. volumetric energy content. viscosity. freezing point. and thermal stability. High density. a particularly important property of jet fuel. can afford much impulse to guarantee large payload and long range. especially for military aircrafts and missiles with limited fuel tanks. Low freezing point and good kinematic viscosity ensure proper fuel fluidity in engine system. However. the increase of density by increasing the carbon atoms usually causes the increase of freezing point and viscosity. In general. the density increases accompanied with worse low‐temperature properties. Advanced jet fuel should have high energy density. high thermal stability. and appropriate low‐temperature performance. ie low freezing point and low viscosity. With regard to this. advanced jet fuels have been synthesized and used. which provide higher density and net heat of combustion (NHOC) than conventional distilled fuels (Dahl.

Brazil: a basin modeling and material balance approach,2004,Thamy CSD Silva and Felix TT Goncalves and Ricardo P Bedregal and Elio P Cuinas Filho and Luiz Landau,,,,,,The existence of a petroleum system requires a number of essential elements (traps and source. reservoir and seal rocks) and processes (HC generation and migration and trap formation) besides an adequate timing among the elements and processes and a positive balance between the HC generation and losses due to (re)migration. Due to the complexity of petroleum systems dynamics. the basin modeling technique is the only one that allows the integration of all geological. geophysical and geochemical data as well as the simulation of the involved phenomena in a physically consistent way. providing an integrated view of the geologic history of the processes and elements of the petroleum system. The main objectives of this work are to show a reconstruction of the thermal and maturity evolution of the sedimentary section of the Reconcavo Basin using a multi-1D (pseudo 3D) approach. to model petroleum generation and expulsion. and the evolution of the pod(s) of source rock through time and space using the pseudo 3D approach. simulate petroleum migration along the main carrier-beds. accumulation and remigration from the potential traps. The advanced exploratory stage (mature). the geologic context (an intracratonic rift that resembles a close system) and the availability of large amounts of public data. make the Reconcavo Basin an excellent place to perform a study that can provide basis to an estimate of the remaining petroleum potential in analogous petroleum systems.

Investigation of the data allowed the characterization in time and space of the petroleum pathways from source rock to trap. which represent the oil in-place in reservoir rocks ranging from Neocomian to Tertiary in age. Two major petroleum systems were selected as representative case-studies from various stages of basin formation in Brazilian South Atlantic basins (1) the pro-and syn-rift sequence. in the Camamu basin near the eastern tip of Brazil. and (2) the drift sequence. the Campos F basin. offshore Campos near Rio de Janeiro in southeast Brazil. Although there are other oil source rocks of Aptian. Albian. Cenomanian/Turonian and Tertiary ages in the South Atlantic margin. about 90% of the known petroleum in Brazil originates from Lower Cretaceous source rocks deposited in lacustrine environments in the proto-Atlantic rift.

1303363,Economic Analysis Case Studies of Battery Energy Storage with SAM,2015,Nicholas DiOrio and Aron Dobos and Steven Janzou,,,,,,Interest in energy storage has continued to increase as states like California have introduced mandates and subsidies to spur adoption. This energy storage includes customer sited behind-the-meter storage coupled with photovoltaics (PV). This paper presents case study results from California and Tennessee. which were performed to assess the economic benefit of customer-installed systems. Different dispatch strategies. including manual scheduling and automated peak-shaving were explored to determine ideal ways to use the storage system to increase the system value and mitigate demand charges. Incentives. complex electric tariffs. and site specific load and PV data were used to perform detailed analysis. The analysis was performed using the free. publically available System Advisor Model (SAM) tool. We find that installation of photovoltaics with a lithium-ion battery system priced at $300/kWh in Los Angeles under a high demand charge utility rate structure and dispatched using perfect day-ahead forecasting yields a positive net-present value. while all other scenarios cost the customer more than the savings accrued.

We present a case study to show how this methodology is applied to a multi-use/multi-function telecommunications facility in southern California.

We then evaluate how those technologies could be incorporated alongside existing diesel generators in a microgrid to increase resiliency at the site. where resiliency is quantified in terms of the amount of time that the microgrid can sustain the critical load during a grid outage. We find that adding PV and BESS to the existing backup diesel generators with a fixed fuel supply extends the amount of time the site could survive an outage by 1.8 days. from 1.7 days for the existing diesel-only backup system to 3.5 days for the PV/diesel/BESS hybrid system.

1303384,DC-connected solar plus storage modeling and analysis for behind-the-meter systems in the system advisor model,2018,Nicholas A DiOrio and Janine M Freeman and Nate Blair,,,,3777-3782,IEEE,A detailed model for PV plus DC-connected batteries was developed. This model was compared to an existing ACconnected battery model in the System Advisor Model (SAM) tool using a hypothetical Honolulu residence with a PV plus storage system. The stand-alone PV system was shown to provide the most value; however due to the increased difficulty of PV systems being approved for grid interconnection in Hawaii. it is valuable to install an AC or DC connected battery to enable full PV self-consumption under a less restrictive interconnection option.

Golden. CO (United States),With renewable energy growing to 10%-20% or more of overall electricity generation. design objectives for renewable power plants are shifting from producing energy at the lowest levelized cost to maximizing profitability. Several research and commercial efforts have investigated how to size respective generation and storage assets together for hybrid power plant systems-including wind. solar. battery storage and other technologies. However. the physical design of hybrid power plants has yet to be considered in detail. Even the design of individual solar and wind power plants is complex with large numbers of design variables. constraints and complex physical interactions across subsystems. Developing an integrated approach for the design of hybrid power plants including multiple generation technologies compounds this complexity and requires domain knowledge across the technologies as well as new approaches for addressing the statistical representation of resource availability and revenue opportunities. To inform the research needs on physical design of these hybrid power plants. a workshop was held in December 2018 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

In this paper. we investigated the effect of the support on photocatalytic water oxidation under visible light using cobalt oxide as a multielectron catalyst. A range of supported Co3O4 nanoclusters have been successfully synthesized via wet impregnation and bisolvent methods. Compared with the wet impregnation approach. the bisolvent method allowed us to obtain a high quality catalyst with all the Co3O4 nanoclusters formed inside the mesoporous support using hexane/water as the combination. The resulting catalyst consists of Co3O4 nanoclusters with a very small particle size (∼25 nm) and narrow size distribution.

Here. two nanostructured K‐containing δ‐MnO2 are synthesized: K‐δ‐MnO2 nanosheets and K‐δ‐MnO2 nanoparticles. both of which exhibit high catalytic activity in visible‐light‐driven water oxidation. The role of alkaline cations in oxygen evolution is first explored by replacing the K+ ions in the δ‐MnO2 structure with H+ ions through proton ion exchange. H‐δ‐MnO2 catalysts with a similar morphology and crystal structure exhibit activities per surface site approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of K‐δ‐MnO2. although both nanostructured H‐δ‐MnO2 catalysts have much larger Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas.

Typically. the ODH step is endothermic. due to the high endothermicity to reduce the redox catalyst. This energy demand is met through sensible heat carried by the redox catalyst from the regenerator. which operates at a higher temperature. This temperature difference between the two reactors leads to exergy losses. We report an Fe-Mn redox catalyst showing tunable exothermic heat of reduction.

Conventional ODH. however. suffers from challenges in process safety. controllability. and high capital cost due to the needs to co-feed gaseous oxygen with ethane. In chemical looping ODH (CL-ODH). ethane is partially oxidized by active lattice oxygen in a redox catalyst. producing ethylene and water. The reduced redox catalyst is subsequently re-oxidized with air in a separate reactor prior to the initiation of another redox cycle. Such a cyclic redox scheme eliminates the needs for cryogenic air separation as well as O2 co-feeding. In this process. it is crucial to suppress deep oxidation without sacrificing ethane conversion. We reported an Mg6MnO8 based redox catalyst which is capable of enhancing ethylene single pass yield by 38.9% compared to thermal cracking1.

CL–ODH uses promoted Mg 6 MnO 8 as the oxygen carrier (ie. redox catalyst). In the ODH reactor. the promoted Mg 6 MnO 8 is reduced while converting ethane to ethylene and water. The reduced redox catalyst is then transferred to the regenerator where it is re‐oxidized with air before circulating back to the ODH reactor to complete the chemical loop. Heat from the regenerator is also transferred to the ODH reactor along with the redox catalyst particles.

1303414,Development of photocatalytic materials for water oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction,2012,Seif Yusuf,,,,,,Fossil fuels are currently the primary energy source of the world. but are an undesirable energy source for the future as their combustion generates CO2. a greenhouse gas and it is unlikely current reserves of fossil fuel will meet future energy demand. One alternative is to use solar energy. which provides more than enough energy to meet demand. to produce carbonaceous fuels. These solar fuels are advantageous because their generation uses H2O. which is abundant. and CO2. which needs to be removed from the atmosphere. The oxidation of H2O is needed to the electrons needed for the reduction of CO2 In this thesis. nanostructured manganese and cobalt oxide catalysts were synthesized and systematically investigated as cheap. stable. and efficient H2O oxidation catalysts. The first part of research mainly focused on the development of highly efficient manganese based oxygen evolution catalysts and investigation of effects of alkaline cations in the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. K+ containing and Na+ containing δ-MnO2 catalysts were synthesized using a hydrothermal synthetic approach. To determine the effect of alkaline ions. K+ in δ-MnO2 was replaced by H+ ions using an ion-exchange process. The K-δ-MnO2 and Na-δ-MnO2 catalysts had TOF’s about one order of magnitude higher than their H-δ-MnO2 counterparts. even though the H-δ-MnO2 catalysts have much larger surface areas. The H-δ-MnO2 may have had lower activity because the Ru2+(bpy)3 was too large to access the new surface sites. The results suggest that the alkaline cations stabilize the MnO2 layers and are not directly involved in the H2O oxidation …,True,SV6A8SwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12916,,,,,https://udspace.udel.edu/bitstream/handle/19716/12916/Seif_Yusuf_thesis.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Furthermore. sustainable biomass supply chain allows considering this primary energy source as carbon neutral. To this regard. the use of local bio-residues from agro-industries can have a significant impact on the local economies and the local production of renewable energy. In a previous research study. the authors investigated the impact of the energy integration of citrus peel gasification in a citrus juice factory. The study showed that using citrus peel waste to produce heat and power through the biomass gasification-CHP system. the whole factory’s energy demand cannot be covered.

Steam-char reaction result to be the one of the most relevant and controlling step of the gasification process. hence a fundamental understanding of the kinetics of this heterogeneous reaction is needed in the design of efficient gasification systems. In this work. the reaction kinetics of char derived from olive pomace and steam was investigated. The kinetic study was developed by means of thermogravimetric analysis carried out in steamnitrogen atmosphere. using an integral isoconversional approach. The ultimate and proximate analysis of the parent biomass was determined. while the char morphology was studied through scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen isothermal adsorption analysis for determining the specific surface area. The morphological analysis were carried out on the pristine char and the char after 50% of conversion in nitrogen-steam atmosphere. The results of the kinetic study showed slight variation of activation energy with conversion. with an average value of 161 kJ/mol.

Agro-industrial activities represent important source of residual biomass that could be used as renewable feedstocks for energy purpose. enhancing local economies. while reducing residues/wastes landfilling. Among the different thermochemical biomass conversion technologies. gasification allows to produce a gas mixture (syngas). used for electricity generation. synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. Furthermore. it is also considered a preferable route for electricity production from small plants in remote areas. where gasification coupled with internal combustion engine systems are more convenient than combustion coupled with steam engine. In order to realize and encourage the development of local bioenergy economies. further contributions to increase technical data and information about the feasibility of sustainable projects are of fundamental importance. From the above. the intent of this dissertation is to supply fundamental information and tools for the design of steam gasification reactors and systems fed by agro-industrial residues that are typical of the Sicilian economic network and residues from 2nd generation bioethanol production.The first approach used for facing this issue consisted in the study of gas-solid reactions kinetics of steam gasification of different chars obtained from residual biomass.

Among potential alternatives. particular attention has been recently addressed toward the exploitation of residual biomass and wastes as sources for syngas production by thermo-chemical processes for heat and power production. Fruits processing industries generate important amount of residues. which must be managed properly by recycling. incineration or land filling. Due to the high carbon content. these residues represent a significant source of energy that could be valorized by gasification processes. Hence. our attention was focused on the energy recovery from orange peels residues produced by a Sicilian agro-industrial company by steam gasification. Thermodynamic and experimental analysis were carried out. Experiments were performed in a fixed bed laboratory scale reactor working with catalytic materials (Ni/Al 2 O 3.

1303465,A robust method for the quantitative shadow imaging of dense reacting particulate flows,2013,Pal Toth and Arpad B Palotas and Terry A Ring and Eric G Eddings,,"The 8th US National Combustion Meeting, Park City, Utah",,,,Quantitative shadow imaging or particle shadow velocimetry is a relatively recent method for the quantification and analysis of heterogeneous flows. Shadow imaging can yield information about the geometric characteristics of sprays. jets and particulate flows. When applied to the analysis of solid-gas or solid-liquid flows. shadow velocimetry allows for the extraction of individual particle velocities. sizes and shape parameters. An advantage of shadow imaging over other diagnostic techniques is that it retains the spatial information of individual particles and the positions of particles relative to each other can be analyzed. Another advantage is that shadowgraphy is a direct technique that allows for the visualization of microscales in heterogeneous flows. Digital image processing and analysis makes shadow imaging quantitative. By image processing techniques. individual particles are detected in the shadow images which are further analyzed to obtain their geometric and hydrodynamic properties. The fidelity of data extracted by quantitative shadow imaging depends on the quality of images and the robustness and capabilities of the image processing algorithm used. In this study we focus on the processing of very degraded shadow images of dense reacting particulate flows. An algorithm that is robust enough to reliably quantify such images does not exist yet.

HER requires the catalysts which could provide reversible binding of hydrogen that is energetically comparable with the process catalyzed by platinum (Pt). According to the most recent industrial reports. only 5% of worldwide produced hydrogen is coming from electrolytic water splitting. One of the main obstacles is a very high onset overpotential which results in high energy consumption during hydrogen production process. Another problem is use of rather expensive precious metals and complicated multistep technological processes for synthesis of nanostructured materials. In this chapter. the main structural. compositional. and morphological aspects defining the efficiency of inorganic materials toward HER are summarized. Furthermore. materials containing earth-abundant transition and rare earth metals are highlighted as possible alternatives to Pt.

During ultrasonic treatment of metal particles the changes in bulk (crystallite size. microstrain) and surface (composition. morphology) properties were monitored in order to unravel the fundamental aspects of acoustic cavitation and their effect on sonicated matter as well as to explain the enhancement of electrocatalytic performance of the initially inactive metal alloy catalysts.

To address this. the present work scrutinises the properties of antimony-metal (Co. Mn. Ni. Fe. Ru) oxides synthesised as flat thin films by a solution-based method for the oxygen evolution reaction in 0.5 MH 2 SO 4. Among the non-noble-metal catalysts. only cobalt-antimony and manganese-antimony oxides demonstrate high stability and reasonable activity under ambient conditions. but slowly lose activity at elevated temperatures. The ruthenium-antimony system is highly active. requiring an overpotential of 0.39±0.03 and 0.34±0.01 V to achieve 10 mA cm-2 at 24±2 and 80 C. respectively. and remaining remarkably stable during one-week tests at 80 C. The S-number for this catalyst is higher than that for the high-performance benchmark Ir-based systems. Density functional theory analysis and physical characterisation reveal that this high stability is supported by the enhanced hybridisation of the oxygen p-and metal d-orbitals induced by antimony. and can arise from two distinct structural scenarios: either formation of an antimonate phase. or nanoscale intermixing of metal and antimony oxide crystallites.,True,TmDV08QAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,0,https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr287271,,,,,,0,0,0

These features open new possibilities such as alternative electrolytes that are known to be incompatible with a sulfur environment. In this work. we introduce a Li–Se battery comprising the non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte (N-propyl-N-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonylimide)) which allows the battery to operate stably from room temperature to up 70 °C. A N.S.O tri-doped mesoporous carbon is employed as a porous conductive network to host the selenium. At room temperature. the Li–Se battery shows capacity retention of 91% at 1C-rate after 100 cycles and can deliver a capacity up to 560 mA h g−1 at 0.2C.

1303513,Decomposition of Ireland's carbon emissions from 1990 to 2010: An extended Kaya identity,2013,Tadhg O'Mahony,59,Energy Policy,,573-581,Elsevier,In recent decades. Ireland has been an important example of a development pathway where rapid economic growth was accompanied by rising energy demand and increasing carbon emissions. Understanding the driving forces of carbon emissions is necessary for policy formulation and decomposition analysis is widely used for this purpose. This study uses an extended Kaya identity as the scheme and applies the log mean Divisia index (LMDI I) as the decomposition technique. Change in carbon emissions is decomposed from 1990 to 2010 and includes a measure of the effect of renewable energy penetration. Results illustrate that scale effects of affluence and population growth act to increase emissions and are countered primarily by energy intensity and fossil fuel substitution. Renewable energy penetration has a minor effect but has been increasing in recent years.

1303519,Energy-Related Carbon Emissions in Ireland: Scenarios to 2020,2010,Tadhg O'Mahony,,,,,Technological University Dublin,The consumption of energy and related carbon emissions are a development challenge requiring analysis and policy insights. Current analysis of future change in Ireland relies on quantitative point forecasts within which accuracy is difficult to achieve. A scenario analysis approach has often been applied with the longer term but is also useful on shorter time-scales. This research applied a combination of decomposition analysis and scenario analysis to identify and analyse the driving forces of change in Ireland historically from 1990-2007 and in the future to 2020. The historical decomposition used the LMDI I technique and was further quantified to 2020 using an integrated qualitative and quantitative scenario approach to explore plausible alternative developments. The historical analysis gives insights at macro and sectoral level to attribute change to a range of structural. scale and intensity effects. The macro decomposition was based on an extended Kaya identity while the sectoral offers deeper insights including a detailed representation of transport. Since 1990 energy intensity improved substantially in the macro decomposition. but the sectoral decomposition shows considerable heterogeneity. The four scenarios show divergence in emissions trajectories based on alternative development paths. This presents in absolute emission totals but also in sectoral contribution. Change arises not only in technological and economic drivers but also through drivers such as governance and society that underpin the evolution of the alternative scenarios.,True,yXXb5YYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,3,https://arrow.tudublin.ie/builtdoc/6/,4645046278614919549,/scholar?cites=4645046278614919549,,,,0,0,0

1303535,Fatigue design of lattice materials and application to stent-like structures,2012,Ehsan Masoumi Khalil Abad,,,,,,Engineering cellular materials are hybrid materials obtained by distributing voids in a solid medium. The voids can have a stochastic architecture (foams) or their shape and size can follow a tailored pattern (lattice materials). In particular. lattice materials are defined as periodic cellular materials obtained by tessellating the plane. or the space. with a 2D or 3D unit cell along independent directions.Besides being mechanically superior to other materials (Fleck et al.. 2010; Schaedler et al.. 2011; Vigliotti and Pasini. 2012a). lattice materials have been shown to be attractive for their multifunctional properties. eg thermal insulation. sound resistance and shock energy damping; they are thus of potential use in a broad range of applications. including battery electrodes. catalyst supports. vibration insulators. jet-engine nacelles. ultra lightweight sandwich panels. and biomedical implants (Banerjee and Bhaskar. 2009; Gibson et al.. 2010; Kumar and McDowell. 2009; Mullen et al.. 2009; Murr et al.. 2010; Schaedler et al.. 2011). New advancements in manufacturing process. such as rapid prototyping manufacturing techniques. have offered engineers and material scientists a precise control over the microstructure of the lattice materials.

1303538,GH Farrahi. Mahdi Masoumi Khalil Abad. Amir Ahmad Zare & Siavash Parsa,,Ehsan Masoumi Khalil Abad,,,,,,This study presents the results of failure analysis of a 28 MW gas turbine at the Rei electrical power plant. The gas turbine failed during the shutdown period and near its second natural frequency at 4200 rpm. Initial inspections revealed that the compressor disk of stage 15 was fractured. and all of the stationary and rotary blades of stages 14–18 of the compressor had been detached or broken from the dovetail region of the disks. The fracture roots were investigated by performing finite element modeling and fractography analysis. It was shown that a crack was initiated from the disk edge on its interface with the rotor shaft and was propagated under cyclic loading. As a result of the malfunction of the compressor bleed valves. which led to compressor surge. the amplitude of vibration of the turbine rotor increased under aerodynamically induced forces. This increase in the natural frequency of the turbine. near the second natural frequency of the turbine. led to final ductile fracture of the compressor disk of stage 15. Finally. the turbine rotor stopped with the loud noise produced by the direct shearing of the fractured disk on the stator casing.

For that reason. several hierarchical or cluster-based routing methods have been proposed to provide an efficient way to save energy during communication. However. their main challenge is to have efficient mechanisms to achieve the trade-off between increasing the network lifetime and accomplishing acceptable transmission latency. In this paper. we propose a novel protocol for cluster-based wireless sensor networks called PEAL (Power Efficient and Adaptive Latency).

The use of HALEs for telecommunication networks has the potential to deliver a wide range of communication services (from high-quality voice to high-definition videos. as well as high-data-rate wireless channels) cost effectively. One of the main challenges of this technology is to design its power supply system. which must provide the enough energy for long time flights in a reliable way. In this paper a photovoltaic/hydrogen system is proposed as power system for a HALE aircraft due its high power density characteristic. In order to obtain the optimal sizing for photovoltaic/hydrogen system a particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is used. As a case study. theoretical design of the photovoltaic/hydrogen power system for three different HALE aircrafts located at 18° latitude is presented. At this latitude. the range of solar radiation intensity was from 310 to 450 Wh/sqm/day. The results obtained show that the photovoltaic/hydrogen systems calculated by PSO can operate during one year with efficacies ranging between 45.82% and 47.81%.

Sargassum spp. was activated with potassium hydroxide at different temperatures (700. 750. and 800 C) and then doped with pyridine (N700. N750. and N800). As a result of the activation process. the 800 C sample showed a high surface area (2765 m 2 g− 1) and good onset potential (0.870 V) and current density (4.87 mA cm− 2). The ORR performance of the electrocatalysts in terms of their current density was N800> N750> N700> 750> 800> 700. while the onset potential decreased in the following order: N800> 800> 750> 700> N700> N750. The fuel cell performance of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) prepared with electrocatalyst synthesized at 750 C and doped with pyridine was 12.72 mW cm− 2. which was close to that from Pt/C MEA on both the anode and cathode (14.42 mW cm− 2).

1303565,Green Illusions: The Dirty Secrets of Clean Energy and the Future of Environmentalism,2012,Ozzie Zehner,,,,456,University of Nebraska Press,We don’t have an energy crisis. We have a consumption crisis. And this book. which takes aim at cherished assumptions regarding energy. offers refreshingly straight talk about what’s wrong with the way we think and talk about the problem. Though we generally believe we can solve environmental problems with more energy—more solar cells. wind turbines. and biofuels—alternative technologies come with their own side effects and limitations. How. for instance. do solar cells cause harm? Why can’t engineers solve wind power’s biggest obstacle? Why won’t contraception solve the problem of overpopulation lying at the heart of our concerns about energy. and what will? This practical. environmentally informed. and lucid book persuasively argues for a change of perspective. If consumption is the problem. as Ozzie Zehner suggests. then we need to shift our focus from suspect alternative energies to improving social and political fundamentals: walkable communities. improved consumption. enlightened governance. and. most notably. women’s rights. The dozens of first steps he offers are surprisingly straightforward. For instance. he introduces a simple sticker that promises a greater impact than all of the nation’s solar cells. He uncovers why carbon taxes won’t solve our energy challenges (and presents two taxes that could). Finally. he explores how future environmentalists will focus on similarly fresh alternatives that are affordable. clean. and can actually improve our well-being.

Tetragametic Chimerism and Trans-Subjectivity,2008,Aaron T Norton and Ozzie Zehner,36,Women's Studies Quarterly,3/4,106-125,The Feminist Press at the City University of New York,Imagine being told by a doctor that a twin. one you never knew you had. exists inside you. It is well known that fraternal twins arise from two fer tilized eggs that develop into nonidentical siblings. Less well known is that these two zygotes sometimes overlap and fuse so completely as to develop into one body with two distinct sets of DNA. a phenomenon called tetragametic chimerism (Tippett 1983). We explore how this rare occurrence exposes complex links between understandings of DNA. human subjectivity. and definitions of motherhood. We focus on cases in the United States of two chimeric women. Lydia and Karen. who were subjected to genetic tests for parentage and subsequently deemed by med ical authorities not to be the mothers of their children.

This approach allows for desirable outputs to be expanded while undesirable outputs are contracted simultaneously. A drawback of the DDF approach is that the direction vector to the production boundary is fixed arbitrarily. which may not provide the best efficiency measure. Therefore. this study extends the previous framework of efficiency analysis to introduce a new slacks-based measure of efficiency called the scale directional distance function (SDDF) approach. This new approach determines the optimal direction to the frontier for each unit of analysis and provides dissimilar expansion and contraction factors to achieve a more reasonable eco-efficiency score.

In this study. we have developed some new Data Envelopment Analysis models to find efficient power plants based on less fuel consumption. combusting less polluting fuel types. and incorporating emission factors in order to measure the ecological efficiency trend. We then applied these models to measuring eco-efficiency during an eight-year period of power industry restructuring in Iran. Results reveal that there has been a significant improvement in eco-efficiency. cost efficiency and allocative efficiency of the power plants during the restructuring period.

1303599,How Managerial Ties and Appropriability Regimes affect Open Innovation,2011,M Muzamil Naqshbandi and Sharan Kaur and Malaysia Behrouz Arabi,,16th IBIMA Conference on Innovation and Knowledge Management: A Global Competitive Advantage,,,,Given the rapid technological advances and implications of globalization. the need to create not only innovations but faster innovation has become a part of sustaining or gaining competitive advantage. Due to this. firms are increasingly seen shifting from the traditional innovation model which relied on a firm’s internal R&D to the more porous open innovation paradigm which utilizes resources both internal and external to a firm to come up with innovations. However success in the open innovation paradigm is contingent upon some internal and external factors of a firm. This conceptual paper first discusses how one such internal factor-managerial ties-impacts the success of open innovation. Second. this paper looks at the moderating role of an external factor-appropriability regimes–on the relationship between managerial ties and success of open innovation. We propose that building managerial ties is important for the creation of open innovation since open innovation requires exploration and exploitation of external resources. We further posit that presence of strong appropriability regimes is crucial to reap the benefits of managerial ties in the open innovation model and that in presence of weak appropriability regimes. managerial ties may not produce results as valuable. Propositions are developed. managerial implications underscored and future research directions highlighted.,True,lpqYT6AAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Muzamil_Naqshbandi/publication/266911314_How_Managerial_Ties_and_Appropriability_Regimes_affect_Open_Innovation/links/55b72e1508aec0e5f4380c69/How-Managerial-Ties-and-Appropriability-Regimes-affect-Open-Innovation.pdf,7666153957135033148,/scholar?cites=7666153957135033148,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Muzamil_Naqshbandi/publication/266911314_How_Managerial_Ties_and_Appropriability_Regimes_affect_Open_Innovation/links/55b72e1508aec0e5f4380c69/How-Managerial-Ties-and-Appropriability-Regimes-affect-Open-Innovation.pdf,0,0,0
1303600,Modeling eco-efficiency changes of heterogeneous firms with an application in power plants,2013,Behrouz Arabi,,,,,,The objective of power industry restructuring worldwide has been to enhance efficiency. hence providing an increased focus on efficiency measurement in power industries. Power generation which plays a key role in the power industry accounts for a noticeable share of emission generation amongst all power industry sectors. This would be costly not only for the sector itself. but also for the entire economy. Thus. the ecological impact of power generation should not be neglected in efficiency measurement. In addition. the non-homogeneous nature of power generation technologies has always been a barrier to drawing a complete picture of power generation industry efficiency or to compare the relative efficiency of different power plant technologies using methodologies such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). In view of the above. this research aims for introducing a more comprehensive DEA method to measure the ecological efficiency or eco-efficiency trend of heterogeneous power plants during an eight-year period of power industry restructuring in Iran using a popular measure known as the Malmquist-Luenberger index (MLI). Toward this aim. the study tackles a prevalent infeasibility problem which occurs when the traditional Directional Distance Function (DDF) or slack-based DEA models are adopted to measure MLI. This study introduces an algorithm accompanied by a slack-based model to tackle the infeasibility problem. In addition. to represent thermodynamic realities of mechanical systems more accurately. the study incorporates the Materials Balanced Principle (MBP) requirement in the measurement of efficiency by adopting a …,True,lpqYT6AAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,http://studentsrepo.um.edu.my/5732/,,,,,http://studentsrepo.um.edu.my/5732/1/Behrouz_Arabi-HHB110014-_PhD_Thesis-Final.pdf,0,0,0

Thus. the efficiency of the HVAC system and the performance of the building envelope have great importance in reducing the energy used for heating and cooling purposes. In this study. the application of thermal insulation on the walls and roof of the Hasan Polatkan Airport terminal building was investigated from energy. environment and cost aspects. This study determined the optimum insulation thickness and assessed its effects on environmental performance based on energy flows. Environmental payback periods were calculated depending on the optimum insulation thickness. The life cycle assessment (LCA) method was used to assess whether the decrease in energy consumption after applying the insulation balanced the environmental effects during the period between the production and application of the thermal insulation material. The global warming potential (GWP) based on IPCC100. and the effects on human health (HH). the ecosystem and natural resources were evaluated according to the ReCiPe method. LCA results were obtained by processing data taken from ecoinvent 3 database present in the Sima Pro 8.3. 0.0 software.

This work reports results over a three-year period for currently-installed community and fenceline air quality monitoring for the Chevron refinery in Richmond. California. USA. This paper presents the most comprehensive air quality dataset that has been published to date for a community near a petroleum refinery. including concentration of different air toxics (eg. benzene. toluene. xylenes. etc.) and criteria air pollutants (eg. ozone (O 3). sulfur dioxide (SO 2). and particulate matter (PM)). Instrumental techniques such as ultra-violet differential absorption spectroscopy (UV-DOAS). laser-based spectroscopy and real-time gas chromatography (GC) were used in the community and fenceline monitors. From 2015 to 2017. measured concentrations at community monitors near the Richmond refinery were generally below California thresholds for acute and chronic health (only two exceedances were observed for 8-h average benzene concentrations during the three-year monitoring period). Although more detailed speciation for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) would be needed to confirm certain source profile identities. preliminary application of source apportionment methods indicates the prevalence of typical urban emission profiles. such as from traffic. in the measured community data.

1303640,Revised Estimation Method for Emissions from Automated Plunger Lift Liquid Unloadings,2020,Adam Pacsi and David W Sullivan and David T Allen,7,Environments,4,25,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,A variety of liquid unloading techniques are used to clear accumulated liquids from the wellbore to increase production rates for oil and gas wells. Data from national measurement studies indicate that a small subset of wells with plunger lift assist. that vent with high frequency and short event duration. contribute a significant fraction of methane emissions from liquid unloading activities in the United States. Compared to direct measurement of emissions at 24 wells in a field campaign. the most commonly used engineering emission estimate for this source category. which is based on the volume of gas in the wellbore. does not accurately predict emissions at the individual well (R 2= 0.06). An alternative emission estimate is proposed that relies on the duration of the venting activity and the gas production rate of the well. which has promising statistical performance characteristics when compared to direct measurement data. This work recommends well parameters that should be collected from future field measurement campaigns that are focused on this emission source.

1303641,Spatially resolved life cycle models for the environmental footprint of electricity generation,2014,Adam Philip Pacsi,,,,,,Electricity generation has significant environmental impacts. including on regional air quality. greenhouse gas emissions. and water availability. Modeling the overall environmental impact of electricity generation requires linked simulations of power generation. air pollution physics and chemistry. greenhouse gas emissions. and water use. Tools for performing these analyses in an integrated manner are just beginning to emerge. This work expands on the development of linked models for electricity generation. air quality. and water use that have provided single-day snapshots of these environmental impacts. The original model used a non-linear optimization model for power generation. a regional photochemical model for air quality impacts. and self-contained modules for greenhouse gas emissions and water usage at power plants in Texas. The new model includes life cycle scenarios for the power sector (including changes in both the fuel production and electricity generation stages) and expands the temporal scale of the modeling framework to include impacts on monthly. seasonal. and annual time scales instead of on single days. In addition. the air quality framework has been expanded to include atmospheric particulate matter as an air quality impact. This modeling framework will be used to assess the air quality impacts of new natural gas developments in the Barnett and Eagle Ford shale regions in Texas. the consumptive water impact of new natural gas development in Texas. the impact of seasonal versus ozone forecast-based pricing for power plant NOx emissions in the state of Texas. and the potential cost and air quality impacts of …,True,lwm4dSRPYw4C:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/26874,,,,,https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/26874/PACSI-DISSERTATION-2014.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Recent life cycle assessments of natural gas from shale formations have calculated the potential for water use reduction when water use is integrated along the entire natural gas supply chain. if the shale gas is used in natural-gas power plants to displace coal-fired electricity generation. Actual grid operation. however. is more complicated and would require both that sufficient unused natural gas generation capacity exists for the displacement of coal-fired power generation and that the natural gas price is low enough that the switching is financially feasible.

MPC is becoming more and more viable because of the increase in computational power of building automation systems and the availability of a significant amount of monitored building data. MPC has found successful implementation in building thermal regulation. fully exploiting the potential of building thermal mass. Moreover. MPC has been positively applied to active energy storage systems. as well as to the optimal management of on-site renewable energy sources. MPC also opens up several opportunities for enhancing energy efficiency in the operation of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems because of its ability to consider constraints. prediction of disturbances and multiple conflicting objectives. such as indoor thermal comfort and building energy demand. Despite the application of MPC algorithms in building control has been thoroughly investigated in various works. a unified framework that fully describes and formulates the implementation is still lacking. Firstly. this work introduces a common dictionary and taxonomy that gives a common ground to all the engineering disciplines involved in building design and control. Secondly the main scope of this paper is to define the MPC formulation framework and critically discuss the outcomes of different existing MPC algorithms for building and HVAC system management. The potential benefits of the application of MPC in improving energy efficiency in buildings were highlighted.

Due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy. these microgrids are generally equipped with energy storage. such as batteries. Batteries are generally operated using fixed control methods. often deviating from the optimal operation. This aspect has created an opportunity to gain improved outcomes for microgrid owners and operators. This research study describes a pathway for designing an optimisation framework which can be used to optimise the charge and discharge operation of battery storage within a microgrid containing a solar PV system.

Ventilative cooling is a passive cooling technique. which involves the use of outdoor air to lower buildings’ indoor air temperature. In order to determine whether ventilative cooling may have the ability to reduce cooling loads. a detailed analysis of the local climate is needed. The aim of this study was to identify which Australian geographical regions have a suitable climate for the utilization of ventilative cooling techniques. The assessment of climatic potential for each geographic location was carried using two approaches: (i) a methodology which does not require detailed knowledge of the building characteristics. and; (ii) building performance simulation of a ‘typical’ Australian detached home.

Nitrogen-bearing moieties on these scaffolds were proved to influence the modulation of ABC transporters efflux function. This review highlights the potential of semisynthetic nitrogen-containing flavonoid and terpenoid derivatives as candidates for the design of effective MDR reversers. A brief introduction concerning the major role of efflux pumps in multidrug resistance. the potential of natural product-derived compounds in MDR reversal. namely natural flavonoid and terpenoids. and the effect of the introduction of nitrogen-containing groups are provided. The main modifications that have been performed during last few years to generate flavonoid and terpenoid derivatives. bearing nitrogen moieties. such as aliphatic. aromatic and heterocycle amine. amide. and related functional groups. as well as their P-gp.

Among different kinds of fuel cells. low-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are of major importance. but their problems related to hydrogen storage and distribution are forcing the development of liquid fuels such as methanol. ethanol. sodium borohydride and ammonia. In respect to hydrogen. methanol is cheaper. easier to handle. transport and store. and has a high theoretical energy density.
