The designed artificial frameworks maintain fluorescence responses and. therefore. conformational rigidity of typically non-emissive GFP-related chromophores. To replicate a small weight percent of the chromophore inside the natural GFP. two synthetic approaches were utilized: coordinative immobilization and non-coordinative inclusion. Despite low chromophore loading in the rigid matrix. both approaches resulted in formation of photoluminescent hybrid materials. Furthermore. the rigid scaffold dictates chromophore fluorescence by replicating its behavior in solution or the solid state.

Today. imaging is at a crossroads. with molecularly targeted imaging agents expected to broadly expand the capabilities of conventional anatomical imaging methods. Molecular imaging will allow clinicians to not only see where a tumour is located in the body. but also to visualize the expression and activity of specific molecules (e.g. proteases and protein kinases) and biological processes (e.g. apoptosis. angiogenesis. and metastasis) that influence tumour behavior and/or response to therapy. Breast cancer. the most common cancer among women and a research area where our group is actively involved. is a very heterogeneous disease with diverse patterns of development and response to treatment. Hence. molecular imaging is expected to have a major impact on this type of cancer. leading to important improvements in diagnosis. individualized treatment. and drug development. as well as our understanding of how breast cancer arises.,True,PK6SoY8AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,24,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2014.00112/full,10765855298662592717,/scholar?cites=10765855298662592717,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2014.00112/full,0,0,0

PEG coating improves the solubility and stability of the nanoparticles. and provides stealth properties by preventing opsonization and subsequent removal by the reticuloendothelial system. All these effects conferred by the PEG coating are dependent on its molecular weight. Therefore. the selection of the right MW of PEG is a crucial point in the design of new nanomaterials for in vivo applications. The aim of this work lies in the in vivo optimization of the circulation times of small iron oxide nanoparticles by coating them with PEG of different MWs.

In this work. we have developed a biocompatible Raman probe by combining anisotropic silver nanoparticles with the dye rhodamine 6G followed by subsequent coating with bovine serum albumin. This nanosystem presents strong SERS capabilities in the near infrared (NIR) with a very high (2.7× 10 7) analytical enhancement factor. Theoretical calculations reveal the effects of the electromagnetic and chemical mechanisms in the observed SERS effect for this nanosystem. Finite element method (FEM) calculations showed a considerable near field enhancement in NIR. Using density functional quantum chemical calculations. the chemical enhancement mechanism of rhodamine 6G by interaction with the nanoparticles was probed. allowing us to calculate spectra that closely reproduce the experimental results. The nanosystem was tested in cell culture experiments. showing cell internalization and also proving to be completely biocompatible. as no cell death was observed. Using a NIR laser. SERS signals could be detected even from inside cells. proving the applicability of this nanosystem as a biocompatible SERS probe.

These investigations claimed that zwitterionic nanoparticles exhibited a minimal macrophage response and long blood circulation times compared to nanoparticles with other surface charges. These differences in their in vivo behavior are mainly attributed to the interaction of nanoparticles with plasma proteins. Interestingly. most of these studies considered the total surface charge. instead of the outermost layer of the nanomaterial. as being mainly responsible for these undesirable interactions.

This often makes the raw data unsuited for standard Rietveld refinements. In a study based on data collected using image plates at state of the art beamlines the intensity distribution has been closely scrutinized. It was found not to follow the crystallographically well known ie Poisson. gamma. normal or lognormal distributions. The intensities are far better described by the Pareto distribution originally developed for economical statistics.

1174741,Two-dimensional X-ray powder diffraction,2007,Bernd Hinrichsen,,,,,,The combination two-dimensional detectors. powder diffraction and synchrotron light sources has been staggeringly successful. opening doors to many new experiments. The great advantages of such data collection lie in the short exposure times as well as in the huge redundancy. A large angular region of the Bragg cone is recorded in a single exposure; indeed most detectors are set up perpendicular and centrally to the primary beam. intercepting the Bragg cone over the entire azimuthal range. The standard practice is to integrate the image along the ellipses described by the intersection of the cone with the planar detector to a conventional powder pattern. This commonly reduces the amount of information by the square root of the number of pixels. Does this represent the gamut of information contained in a powder diffraction image? A glance at an image from a calibration standard might lend itself to such a conclusion. Less perfect samples. as well as sample environments leave distinctive artefacts on images. How can they be extracted. filtered or interpreted? Methods offering answers to these questions are introduced. The origins of powder diffraction were based on diffraction images. however with the onset of equatorial electronic point detectors all high quality powder diffraction experiments switched to this method. It has remained the experimental doctrine to this day. Only recently have powder diffraction scientists rediscovered the allure of diffraction images. Indeed high pressure powder diffraction experiments are unthinkable without two-dimensional detectors.

DS is usually associated with C. albicans. However. unlike other oral candidiasis. most DS patients have intact host immunity. The presence of a denture alone is usually sufficient for DS. Saliva and its protein contents can theoretically predispose some denture wearers to DS and others resistant toward DS. Here we proposed for the first time to define salivary proteomic profiles of denture wearers with and without DS. SELDI-TOF/MS analysis suggests that there is a proteomic differentiation among control. localized and generalized DS.

Metabolomics holds promise for improving the phenotyping. prediction and understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of complex clinical disorders including abruption. We sought to evaluate maternal early pregnancy pre-diagnostic serum metabolic profiles and abnormal vaginal bleeding as predictors of abruption later in pregnancy.   Methods Maternal serum was collected in early pregnancy (mean 16 weeks. range 15 to 22 weeks) from 51 abruption cases and 51 controls. Quantitative targeted metabolic profiles of serum were acquired using electrospray ionization liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS/MS) and the Absolute IDQ® p180 kit. Maternal sociodemographic characteristics and reproductive history were abstracted from medical records. Stepwise logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the extent to which metabolites aid in the prediction of abruption.

1174789,Thermal Behaviour and Morphology of High Hard Block Content Polyurethanes,,A Saiani and WA Daunch and JW Leenslag and JS Higgins,,,,,,Segmented polyurethane elastomers are linear block copolymers of alternating hard and soft segments. Their physical properties are usually attributed to their microphase separated structure resulting from the incompatibility of the soft and hard segments. Most studies have focused on low hard block content polyurethanes due to their extensive use in industrial applications. One important aspect of the hard segment phase behaviour that remains uncertain is the morphological origin of the apparent multiple melting endotherms.

It was found that the gradual transition from α- to β-phase in the coating occurs in the presence of additives in deposition electrolytes. It was proposed to use charge coming on the formation of nuclei as the correlation parameter to predict the phase composition of obtained lead dioxide deposits. Electrocrystallization of PbO2 begins with the formation of a monolayer on the electrode surface. then the formation and growth of three-dimensional nuclei takes place. The simultaneous formation of α and β phases results in the presence of two linear areas on the plot of (j − j1)1/3 vs. time for the progressive growth of crystals.

Vanadium pentoxide in different forms has been intensively studied. Nano-structured V2O5 is a unique material with properties depending on the conditions of preparation.Vanadium pentoxide nanorods and nanowires have been synthesized by the reverse micelle technique [2]. The length. from 40 nm to 1 μm. can easily be tuned by keeping the particles in a micellar solution after the synthesis. Cao et al.[3] describe a simple method to self-assemble V2O5 nanorods into microspheres.

Spectroscopic measurements in the fundamental optical absorption edge regions were used to characterize the value of γ-induced changes through the observed darkening effect. It is concluded that γ-irradiation with ~3 MGy dose does not produce any detectable changes in the FSDP parameters. but leads to the appearance of satellite peaks at the left and right sides of the FSDP. Detailed analysis allows attributing of these peaks to crystalline As2O3 and S phases. which appear at the surface of g-As2S3 after prolonged γ-irradiation.

1174851,Post-acquisition filtering of salt cluster artefacts for LC-MS based human metabolomic studies,2016,Amy McMillan and Justin B Renaud and Gregory B Gloor and Gregor Reid and Mark W Sumarah,8,Journal of cheminformatics,1,1-5,BioMed Central,Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has emerged as one of the most widely used platforms for untargeted metabolomics due to its unparalleled sensitivity and metabolite coverage. Despite its prevalence of use. the proportion of true metabolites identified in a given experiment compared to background contaminants and ionization-generated artefacts remains poorly understood. Salt clusters are well documented artefacts of electrospray ionization MS. recognized by their characteristically high mass defects (for this work simply generalized as the decimal numbers after the nominal mass). Exploiting this property. we developed a method to identify and remove salt clusters from LC-MS-based human metabolomics data using mass defect filtering. By comparing the complete set of endogenous metabolites in the human metabolome database to actual plasma. urine and stool samples. we demonstrate that up to 28.5 % of detected features are likely salt clusters. These clusters occur irrespective of ionization mode. column type. sweep gas and sample type. but can be easily removed post-acquisition using a set of R functions presented here. Our mass defect filter removes unwanted noise from LC-MS metabolomics datasets. while retaining true metabolites. and requires only a list of m/z and retention time values. Reducing the number of features prior to statistical analyses will result in more accurate multivariate modeling and differential feature selection. as well as decreased reporting of unknowns that often constitute the largest proportion of human metabolomics data.,True,LDl0RQsAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,27,https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0156-0,8446218125150273145,/scholar?cites=8446218125150273145,,https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0156-0,0,0,0

A survey of xerophilic fungi isolated from Canadian and Hawaiian house dust resulted in the isolation of 1039 strains; 296 strains belong to Aspergillus and represented 37 species. Reference sequences were generated for all species and deposited in GenBank. Aspergillus sect. Aspergillus (formerly called Eurotium) was one of the most predominant groups from house dust with nine species identified. Additional cultures deposited as Eurotium were received from the Canadian Collection of Fungal Cultures and were also re-identified during this study. Among all strains. two species were found to be new and are introduced here as A. mallochii and A. megasporus. Phylogenetic comparisons with other species of section Aspergillus were made using sequences of ITS. β-tubulin. calmodulin and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit. Morphological observations were made from cultures grown under standardized conditions. Aspergillus mallochii does not grow at 37 C and produces roughened ascospores with incomplete equatorial furrows.

However. the generation of alkali metal and silver anions via collision-induced dissociation of the metal oxalate anion has not been previously been reported. though Tian and coworkers recently investigated the dissociation of lithium oxalate [18]. The exothermic decomposition of alkali metal oxalate anion to carbon dioxide in the collision cell of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer leaves no place for the electron to reside. resulting in a double electron-transfer reaction to produce an alkali metal anion. This reaction is facilitated by the negative electron affinity of carbon dioxide and. as such. the authors believe that metal oxalates are potentially unique in this respect.

The experimental size dependence of the extinction and emission spectra for silver nanoparticles were also studied. The nanoparticles were functionalized with fluorescent glycine dimers. Spectral position of the resonance extinction and photoluminescence emission for particles with average diameters ranging from 9 to 32 nm were examined. As the particle size increased. the spectral peaks for both extinction and the intrinsic emission of silver nanoparticles shifted to the red end of the spectrum. The intrinsic photoluminescence of the particles was orders of magnitude weaker and was spectrally separated from the photoluminescence of the glycine dimer ligands. The spectral position of the ligand emission was independent of the particle size; however. the quantum yield of the nanoparticle-ligand system was size-dependent. This was attributed to the enhancement of the ligand’s emission caused by the local electric field strength’s dependence on the particle size. The maximum quantum yield determined for the nanoparticle-ligand complex was (5.2 ± 0.1) %. The nanoparticles were able to penetrate cell membranes of rat basophilic leukemia and neural stem cells fixed with paraformaldehyde. Additionally. toxicity studies were performed.

However. despite being active sulfonyl derivatives. four-membered heterocyclic sulfonamides. β-sultams. do not undergo aminolysis in aqueous solution but preferentially react to give hydrolysis products only.

However. it can also decompose via a competing dehydration reaction that forms CO and H2O. reducing the amount of H2 produced and poisoning the catalyst with CO. Formic acid re-formation to hydrogen is typically performed by Pt and Pd catalysts. which while highly active for dehydrogenation also catalyze dehydration. Cu is typically not utilized. as it requires prohibitively high temperatures. although Cu surfaces are very selective toward dehydrogenation. We studied the reaction of formic acid on single-atom alloys (SAAs). consisting of single Pt atoms substituted into a Cu lattice.

These conjugated boron–nitrogen-containing heteroatom compounds show potential for use as charge transport materials in organic electronic devices in which the molecule–contact interface is a crucial factor of device performance. Therefore. to gain a fundamental understanding of the interaction of azaborines with two common metals. we examined 1.2-dihydro-1.2-azaborine and benzene desorption …,True,EQRy8nYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,10,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp5126427,12605494358305473292,/scholar?cites=12605494358305473292,,,0,0,0

The majority of molecular rotor studies involve azimuthal rotors. whereas very few altitudinal rotors have been reported. In this work. altitudinal rotors are formed by means of coupling aryl halides through a surface-mediated Ullmann coupling reaction. producing a reaction state-dependent altitudinal molecular rotor/stator. All steps in the reaction on a Cu(111) surface are visualized by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. The intermediate stage of the coupling reaction is a metal–organic complex consisting of two aryl groups attached to a single copper atom with the aryl rings angled away from the surface. This conformation leads to nearly unhindered rotational motion of ethyl groups at the para positions of the aryl rings.

Consistent with the electron-deficient nature of this reactive intermediate. electron-donating substituents are stabilizing and electron-withdrawing substituents are destabilizing. For example. a dC N3-QM adduct is made stable over the course of observation (7 days) by the presence of an electron-withdrawing ester group that inhibits QM regeneration. Conversely. a related adduct with an electron-donating methyl group is very labile and regenerates its QM with a half-life of approximately 5 h.

One class of alkylating  agent is the quinone methides (QMs). These highly electrophilic molecules are the reactive intermediates of a variety of natural products. such as mitomycin C. Investigation of the reactivity and selectivity of QMs is important in understanding their mechanism of action.  Competition studies with a model QM have been undertaken to investigate the reversibility of the nucleoside adducts formed. as well as their product profile. From these initial studies. it has been found that there are three terminal sites of alkylation. the N1 and N2 of dG and the N6 of dA. as well as two reversible sites. the N1 of dA and the N3 of dC. The N7 adduct of dG was found to deglycosylate over time.  Further studies into the reversibility of the N7 adduct of dG found that the adduct regenerated QM and deglycosylated at approximately the same rates. Thus. these studies have identified a third reversible QM adduct of the 2'-deoxynucleosides.  An oxidative quench of labile QM adducts has been developed. The methodology utilizes [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)]iodobenzene to convert convert the nucleoside adducts to a stable derivative. Use of the oxidative quench will allow for the analysis of the observation of labile QM-DNA adducts and determination of the inherent QM selectivity with duplex DNA.  Studies of substituent effects on the reactivity of QMs were also undertaken.

However. the molecular basis for the biochemical interdependence of these associations remains poorly understood. The aphid–Buchnera endosymbiosis provides a powerful system to elucidate how these symbioses are regulated. In aphids. the supply of essential amino acids depends on an ancient nutritional symbiotic association with the gamma-proteobacterium Buchnera aphidicola. Buchnera cells are densely packed in specialized aphid bacteriocyte cells.

The mechanisms that restrict cWnt signaling to vegetal blastomeres are not well understood. but there is increasing evidence that the egg’s vegetal cortex plays a critical role in this process by mediating localized “activation” of Disheveled (Dsh). To investigate how Dsh activity is regulated along the AV axis. sea urchin-specific Dsh antibodies were used to examine expression. subcellular localization. and post-translational modification of Dsh during development. Dsh is broadly expressed during early sea urchin development. but immunolocalization studies revealed that this protein is enriched in a punctate pattern in a novel vegetal cortical domain (VCD) in the egg. Vegetal blastomeres inherit this VCD during embryogenesis. and at the 60-cell stage Dsh puncta are seen in all cells that display nuclear β-catenin. Analysis of Dsh post-translational modification using two-dimensional Western blot analysis revealed that compared to Dsh pools in the bulk cytoplasm. this protein is differentially modified in the VCD and in the 16-cell stage micromeres that partially inherit this domain. Dsh localization to the VCD is not directly affected by disruption of microfilaments and microtubules. but unexpectedly. microfilament disruption led to degradation of all the Dsh pools in unfertilized eggs over a period of incubation suggesting that microfilament integrity is required for maintaining Dsh stability. These results demonstrate that a pool of differentially modified Dsh in the VCD is selectively inherited by the …,True,dyCmerUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,34,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080693,15359192891746017160,/scholar?cites=15359192891746017160,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080693,0,0,0

Together. these techniques have enabled analysis of cell and developmental biology from a variety of methodological angles. Live imaging is an emerging method for observing dynamic cell processes. such as cell division or cell motility. Having isolated mutations in uncharacterized putative cell cycle proteins it became essential to observe mitosis in situ using live imaging. Most live imaging studies in Drosophila have focused on the embryonic stages that are accessible to manipulation and observation because of their small size and optical clarity. However. in these stages the cell cycle is unusual in that it lacks one or both of the gap phases. By contrast. cells of the pupal wing of Drosophila have a typical cell cycle and undergo a period of rapid mitosis spanning about 20 hr of pupal development. It is easy to identify and isolate pupae of the appropriate stage to catch mitosis in situ. Mounting intact pupae provided the best combination of tractability and durability during imaging. allowing experiments to run for several hours with minimal impact on cell and animal viability. The method allows observation of features as small as. or smaller than. fly chromosomes. Adjustment of microscope settings and the details of mounting. allowed extension of the preparation to visualize membrane dynamics of adjacent cells and fluorescently labeled proteins such as tubulin. This method works for all tested fluorescent proteins and can capture submicron scale features over a variety of time scales.

In this paper. we report a low-cost. simple and portable analytical method for mercury ion quantification based on digital image colorimetry coupled with a smartphone application. A small amount of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was used as a colorimetric agent that is selective only to mercury ions. The yellowish brown color of AgNPs instantly changed to colorless after the addition of mercury ions due to a redox reaction. To increase the portability. we attached the AgNPs onto a medium to create a paper-based analytical device. The final data processing of the colorimetric analysis was conducted using an android application available on the Google Play Store. called “Mercury Detector”. The proposed method has good sensitivity. with a detection limit of 0.86 ppb. which is comparable to those of bulk and more expensive instruments. This allows for the detection of mercury ions as low as 2 ppb (10 nM). which is also the maximum contaminant level permitted in drinking water by the US Environmental Protection Agency.

Cooperation of multiple metal centers to break the strong N2 triple bond has been identified as a crucial step in both the industrial and the natural ammonia syntheses.

Here we report that the unpinned moments of an antiferromagnetic face-centered-cubic Mn layer can drive the magnetization of an adjacent Fe film perpendicular owing to a formation of intrinsic perpendicular anisotropy. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and hysteresis loops show establishment of perpendicular magnetization on Fe/Mn bilayers while temperature was decreased.

1175165,Milk: Carrier of heavy metals from crops through ruminant body to human beings,2016,Muhammad Danish and Kim Wei Chan,38,J. Chem. Soc. Pak,01,39,,Exposure of heavy metals to humans is higher today than ever before in modern history due to continuously increasing industrialization around the globe. Industrial wastes are rich in heavy metals and these wastes are discharged near agricultural fields or mixed with soil. from where these metals are taken up by the crops and are finally transported to humans. Due to this increasing threat of heavy metals contamination in food. it is necessary to analyze the food before consumption. Content of selected metals (Cd. Cr. Cu. Pb and Zn) in cow milk is determined in this study. To investigate the possible pathways of these metals to reach in milk; fodder supplied to these cows was analyzed besides analysis of soil samples on which this fodder was grown. Pearson correlation among metal contents in soil-forage and forage-milk was also determined to check the route of transfer of these metals from soil to forage and from forage to milk. It was found that a strong correlation (p< 0.5) exists for Cr. Cd. Cu and Zn. This shows that these metals are mainly transferred through soil. However. a weak correlation was found for Pb. which shows that Pb is introduced into forage through some other source (automobile exhaust etc.).

Vapor generated from the combined oils (VCO) deactivated Akt. a key player in cancer cell survival and proliferation. Interestingly VCO dephosphorylated Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308; through the suppression of mTOR and pPDK1 respectively. As a consequence of this. diminished phosphorylation of Bad occurred along with the decreased Bcl-xL expression. This subsequently enhanced Bax levels permitting the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol which concomitantly activated caspase 9 and caspase 3 resulting apoptotic cell death. Impairment of Akt activation by VCO also deactivated Mdm2 that effected overexpression of p53 which in turn upregulated p21 expression. This causes enhanced p21 binding to cyclin D1 that halted G1 to S phase progression. Taken together. VCO produces two prong effects on lung cancer cells. it induces apoptosis and blocked cancer cell proliferation. both occurred due to the deactivation of Akt.

This material consumption correlates with both gross domestic product (GDP) and population increases (Figure 9.2) and is inequitably distributed. with 20% of the world’s population accountable for 86% of consumption. whilst the poorest 20% are responsible for only 1.3%. 1 Conventional projections indicate that from 2000—2050 global material throughput is likely to triple. 2 However.,True,Nyp6TywAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,1,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=QmbfLX4TgGEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA220&dq=info:-ViuDqbKqP4J:scholar.google.com&ots=zIMXQBN1cI&sig=sETv8chIZ0jFcD2-NJAjSuMpY78,18350139496280774905,/scholar?cites=18350139496280774905,,,0,0,0

In place of the more usual programme of oral presentations. each speaker instead submits a full paper in advance of the conference and then only presents a 5 minute summary of the work. The remainder of the time is allocated to questions and discussion from the delegates. who have had the opportunity to read the presented papers in advance and prepare their questions. This leads to a rather lively discussion which lies somewhere between traditional conference questions and live. non-anonymous. peerreview.

1175278,Supercritical fluid chromatography,2000,KD Bartle,15,Geochemistry,469,476,,There is tremendous analytical interest in polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) because of their carcinogenic properties and their impact on the environment. PAC mixtures can be very complex and extend over a wide range of molecular masses. They mainly originate from the combustion of fossil fuels and are widespread in the environment. The most commonly used separation techniques for PAC are gas chromatography (GC). high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). GC is often the technique of choice since it works well for low molecular weight and volatile compounds. It is also preferred because the high diffusivity of solutes in gases results in relatively short analysis times.

Pyrosynthesis of higher PAR in the particulate from the two ring PAR would thus be easier to detect for kerosene. Fresh PAR free lubricating oil was used throughout in an attempt to eliminate additional sources of PAR. The kerosene results showed that emissions of higher PAR were an order of magnitude lower than with diesel. However. these PAH emissions were compatible with an unburnt fuel source. as the n-alkane results showed that the higher MW fuel components had a much greater survivablity than for diesel.

To assess the feasibility of using a biopsy specimen for a personalized selection of an imaging agent. the chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) was used as a reference biomarker.  Methods A hybrid CXCR4 targeting peptide (MSAP-Ac-TZ14011) containing a fluorescent dye and a chelate for radioactive labeling was used to directly compare initial flow cytometry–based target validation in fresh tumor tissue to in vivo single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging.

1175371,Merging wildlife and environmental monitoring approaches with forensic principles: application of unconventional and non-invasive sampling in eco-pharmacovigilance,2014,Ngaio L Richards and Sarah Hall and Nancy M Harrison and Lata Gautam and Karen S Scott and Geraldine Dowling and Irene Zorilla and Iñigo Fajardo,5,Journal of Forensic Research,228,,OMICS International,Pharmaceutical residues in the environment have the potential to harm wildlife. A population’s fragility or an animal’s secretive nature may preclude capture and the use of invasive/destructive sampling techniques that are typically used in a risk assessment. Conventionally favoured matrices gathered opportunistically from carcasses have a finite lifespan. thereby limiting the detection window. This multidisciplinary paper aims to promote the use of non-invasive approaches and optimize use of even the most degraded carcasses. We highlight a selection of promising alternative. unconventional and underutilized sample types that could be applied in environmental monitoring efforts and wildlife forensic investigations. With a focus on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). now under increasing scrutiny in the freshwater and terrestrial environment. we first illustrate current sampling practices and gaps in knowledge by summarizing exposure of: 1) aquatic organisms to urban effluent discharged into waterways. and. 2) scavenging species to veterinary residues in livestock and other carrion. We then consider the merits and limitations of a range of alternative environmentally robust sample options that offer a broader detection interval for NSAIDs. with emphasis on hair. wool and feathers.

However. many of these products bring new challenges. While drugs are taken for their efficacy. functional foods need to have tastes that are acceptable to consumers. Bitterness associated with the functional foods is one of the major challenges encountered by food industry today and will remain so in years to come. This important book offers a thorough understanding of bitterness. the food ingredients that cause it and its accurate measurement. The authors provide a thorough review of bitterness that includes an understanding of the genetics of bitterness perception and the molecular basis for individual differences in bitterness perception. This is followed by a detailed review of the chemical structure of bitter compounds in foods where bitterness may be considered to be a positive or negative attribute. To better understand bitterness in foods. separation and analytical techniques used to identify and characterize bitter compounds are also covered. Food processing can itself generate compounds that are bitter. such as the Maillard reaction and lipid oxidation related products.

The behavior of Pt(100) and Pt(110) for the glycerol electrooxidation reaction (GEOR) were compared and analyzed altogether with those previously reported for Pt(111) ( R. M. L. M. Sandrini. J. R. Sempionatto. E. Herrero. J. M. Feliu. J. Souza‐Garcia. C. A. Angelucci. Electrochem. commun. 2018. 86. 149–152). The voltammetric profiles confirm the structure sensitivity of GEOR as well as the role of the surface atoms orientation on the electrocatalytic activity. The Pt(100) surface has shown to be less prone to poisoning during multiple potential cycles in contrast to Pt(110). which suffers an accentuate deactivation at the first positive‐going scan. Spectroscopic results show that the GEOR on all three surfaces is characterized by the presence of two broad bands. centered at circa 1400 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1. This provides evidence that the GEOR mechanism undergoes glycerol dehydrogenation to alkoxydes followed by the formation of aldehyde intermediates adsorbed as η1(O)‐aldehyde and η1(C)‐acyl geometry. respectively.

The DNA deposition was performed at pH 3.0 when the polymer brush is positively charged due to protonation of pyridine groups in P2VP. thus resulting in electrostatic binding of the negatively charged DNA. By applying electrolysis at −1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl reference) oxygen reduction resulted in the consumption of hydrogen ions and local pH increase in the vicinity of the electrode surface. The process resulted in the local pH ca. 7.5 which yielded the negative state of the mixed polymer‐brush due to dissociation of carboxylic groups of PAA.

Hydronium protonation of the hydride on the Mo site is 21.3 kcal/mol more favorable than protonation of the hydrogen on the S site because the electrons localized on the Mo–H bond are readily transferred to form dihydrogen with hydronium.

To obtain guidance in designing improved CO2 catalysts. we want to understand the nature of the active sites on Au NPs.

The standard scaling relation is that the formation energy of *COOH (ΔE*COOH) is proportional to the binding energy of *CO (Ebinding*CO); therefore. decreasing ΔE*COOH to boost the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) causes an increase of Ebinding*CO that retards CO2RR.

BET and Raman spectroscopy show that HNO3 treatment even at 140 °C did not modify the graphene and graphite morphologies but produced significant amounts of different oxygen surface groups. The presence of these groups on few layer graphene and graphite strongly increased the Saq2− oxidation. showing activities comparable to a high surface area activated carbon with a similar amount of oxygen surface groups. The obtained results suggest that the sulfide oxidation efficiency requires a balance between two important effects. i.e. the presence of oxygen functionalities to initiate the Saq2− oxidation and the electrical conductivity that is important to further transfer the electrons removed from …,True,VoRg-c8AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,25,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2013/ta/c3ta10541e,5649431085431230495,/scholar?cites=5649431085431230495,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivo_Teixeira/publication/255773821_Oxidized_few_layer_graphene_and_graphite_as_metal-free_catalysts_for_aqueous_sulfide_oxidation/links/0f31753ce487e30f97000000/Oxidized-few-layer-graphene-and-graphite-as-metal-free-catalysts-for-aqueous-sulfide-oxidation.pdf,0,0,0

The composites were prepared by assembling cellulose nanocrystals surrounding Fe3O4 followed by a controlled thermal decomposition at 400. 600 and 800 ºC. Mössbauer. X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Raman. thermogravimetry (TG). elemental analysis CHN. scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and potentiometric titration indicated that at 400 and 600 ºC the cellulose nanocrystals decompose to different carbon forms. i.e.. films. filaments and particles attached to the Fe3O4 crystals. At higher temperature. i.e.. 800 ºC. this carbon on the magnetite surface further reacted to produce Fe0. UV-Vis. Raman and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) measurements showed that these composites catalyze the oxidation of aqueous sulfide to convert S2-aq to polysulfides Sn2- (where n = 2-9) and also oxygen containing polysulfides HOSn-. Simple kinetic experiments showed very low sulfide oxidation activities for pure Fe3O4 and pure carbon. On the other hand. the composites. especially with 10% C obtained at 600 ºC. were remarkably active.

Specif-ically. in SdFFF. the singlet. doublet. and higher order aggregated clusters elute on the basis of mass and thus appear as separate regularly spaced peaks in the elution profile or fractogram.

1175549,Addictive behaviors amongst university students: contributing factors. student’s perception and addiction rates,2005,Ahmad Houri and Mirvat Hammoud,1,J Soc Sci,2,105-113,,Factors contributing to addictive behaviors affecting student health are analyzed in this study. Smoking. alcohol consumption. and the use of illegal drugs are assessed in a sample of 290 university students. General averages indicate that 37.2% of students smoke cigarettes. 49.8% drink alcohol regularly. and 17.9% have tried illegal drugs while 4.8% of them use it regularly. Age. academic achievement. gender. religion. family status and financial status were correlated to these addictive behaviors. Major findings show a clear relationship between smoking and most variables. The main factor involved in drinking was found to be religion. while illegal drug consumption was most clearly correlated to parents’ education and monthly income. Students’ self perception regarding smoking and tendency to use illegal drug was assessed showing that 11.7% of smokers consider themselves non-smokers while 11.8% considered trying illegal drugs acceptable. Addiction rates after initial consumption are analyzed showing 74.7% for alcohol. 51.7% for smoking cigarettes and 26.9% for drugs.

1175551,What would be the three key preconditions for jumpstarting or scaling up the transfer of environmentally sound technologies for climate change to developing countries?,2016,Ahmad Houri,,,,,,My own research and global experience working directly with impoverished communities demonstrates that. from the perspective of sustainability. there’s little lasting value to transferring any technology to another nation or culture without the following preconditions: 1. Those intended to use the technology must have the capacity to maintain it over time. adapt it to changing local conditions. and. ultimately. manufacture future generations of the technology. This implies that significant investments in capacity-building must be made prior to technology transfer. 2. Those offering the technology as a solution must justify its appropriateness in the local context into which it would become embedded—ie. the ecological. environmental. socio-cultural. and economic setting. The burden of proof is on the proponents of the technology and sizable resources must be invested in researching how the technology might function in the local context; and 3. Authentic. locally-controlled institutions must be engaged in the process of adopting. maintaining and adapting the technology. There must be evidence of local investment in the technology and a meaningful process of community consultation in which the technology is selected voluntarily from amongst multiple options. If these preconditions are not met. our good intentions are likely to transform into technological imperialism. benefiting few. narf_1257 334.. 337,True,CNdJsI4AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,3,https://laur.lau.edu.lb:8443/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10725/3307/What.pdf?sequence=1,3713808510251003121,/scholar?cites=3713808510251003121,,https://laur.lau.edu.lb:8443/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10725/3307/What.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
1175552,Solar thermal collectors perception and application in developing countries,2003,AH Houri and SI Korfali,,Proceedings of ISES 2003 Conference,,,,While renewable energy use is quickly catching up in developed countries. its use in developing countries has been relatively limited. In this paper. a study on the energy consumption patterns of 251 households has been conducted. Only 3.6% were found to have a solar thermal collector (STC) for water heating. A comparative overall analysis of electric consumption shows. rather surprisingly. that STC users generally consume more electricity. This is in line with the fact that the average apartment area for STC users is 278 sq. m. vs. 181 sq. m. for non STC users. the average house value for STC users is $164.000 compared to $92.000 for non STC users. and average house age for STC users is 20 years compared to 36 years for non STC users. This readily identifies the STC group as an upper class with a higher standard of living on average.

Conservation strategies therefore require a detailed understanding of pollination ecology. This two-year study examined the interactions between the sexually deceptive orchid. Orchis galilaea. and its pollinator Lasioglossum marginatum. Relationships were investigated across three different habitats known to support O. galilaea (garrigue. oak woodland. and mixed oak/pine woodland) in Lebanon. Visitation rates to flowers were extremely low and restricted to male bees. The reproductive success of O. galilaea under ambient conditions was 29.3% (±2.4). compared to 89.0% (±2.1) in plants receiving cross-pollination by hand. No difference in reproductive success was found between habitat types. but values of reproductive success were positively correlated to the abundance of male bees.

1175554,Agave lechuguilla as a potential biomass source in arid areas,2016,Ahmad Houri and Nisrine Machaka-Houri,4,"Journal of Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems",1,89-93,Međunarodni centar za održivi razvoj. energetike. voda i okoliša,Biomass productivity presents a challenging problem in arid and semi-arid areas. Despite a large need for energy in the form of solid biomass. liquid fuel or needs for animal feed. these regions remain largely unproductive. A convenient way to overcome this challenge is to utilize plants with high water-use efficiency. Agave lechuguilla is an example of a highly productive (3.8 tons ha-1 yr-1) desert plant that holds the potential for producing biomass with minimal water resources. For this purpose. a global suitability map has been developed showing areas where this plant can be planted. and its productivity was assessed. A Maxent model was used and was further refined by excluding protected areas and used lands (urban. agriculture. etc.). Productivity assessment provides a good way forward for prioritizing the regional utilization of this plant. This study provides an initial analysis for the use of arid and semi-arid regions for biomass production. Results indicate the potential generation of 93.8 million tons per year of dry biomass if the suitable areas were fully utilized. The analytical method can be readily applied to other potential plant species to optimize the use of certain areas.,True,CNdJsI4AAAAJ:Nufq_to8ts0C,2,https://hrcak.srce.hr/150412,14380779132374161157,/scholar?cites=14380779132374161157,,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/221390,0,0,0

Cambridge, Malaga, Spain and gland, Switzerland: IUCN. xiv+ 132pp",,,,The aim of this project was to assess the conservation status of vascular plant species occurring in wetlands in the Eastern Mediterranean region (see Chapter 2. Figure 2.1); no taxa below species level were assessed separately nor were hybrid combinations. The definition of which plants may be considered aquatic is not straightforward. The following definition is considered the most clear and unambiguous available:‘Vascular aquatic plants are interpreted as all Pteridophytina and Spermatophytina whose photosynthetically active parts are permanently or. at least. for several months each year submerged in water or float on the surface of water’(Cook 1996). However. not only is little known about the tolerance or requirements of many plants (for example some ‘photosynthetically active parts’ such as the leaves of many Rubus species may remain submerged for several months but they would never be considered ‘aquatic’in a strict sense) but the duration of tolerance of inundation is unknown. In addition. there are plants which often germinate in temporary water bodies after the water has dried out (for example Cyperus fuscus) but which rarely. if ever grow in water. Therefore. the decision was taken to extend the range of taxa included to cover species such as Phyla nodiflora. which is restricted to the edge of shallow semi-permanent and permanent water courses. as well as Isoetes olympica which is capable of growing in shallow. seasonally inundated depressions (and has even been found in a wet corner of a vineyard).

High bioaccumulation of both metals was accompanied by an increase in dry weight under higher metal treatments. Antioxidant response was observed under both metal stresses. with large increases in superoxide dismutase and peroxidases. Catalase activity declined only in duckweed exposed to Zn while lipid peroxidation as well as H2O2. proline and ascorbate levels increased. The results suggest induction of oxidative stress under both aluminum and zinc toxicity. and also demonstrate duckweed’s capacity to upregulate its antioxidative defense. Additionally. Zn was found to be more toxic than Al to duckweed for the concentrations applied. Due to its high bioaccumulation potential and tolerance via increased antioxidant capacity. duckweed has a potential for …,True,NWDgQzAAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,184,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651309002541,12577322628222777134,/scholar?cites=12577322628222777134,,https://www.bib.irb.hr/382628/download/382628.YEESA4020.pdf,0,0,0
