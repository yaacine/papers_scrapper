The fact behind the use of bioweapons in war. and for use in terroristic attacks is attributed to easy access to a wide range of disease-producing biological agents. cost effectiveness. difficultly in sensing by routine security systems. and also to their transportation from one place to another. Furthermore. novel and accessible technologies give rise to proliferation of such weapons that have significances for regional and global security. In order to eliminate such threats. and in securing the culture and defense of peace. the need for leadership and in devising preventive and protective strategies has been emphasized through international consultation and cooperation. Current concerns regarding the use of BWs result from the increasing number of countries that are engaged in the proliferation of such weapons and their acquisition by terrorist organizations.

China. Since then. the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has rapidly invaded every corner of the world. Before the end of September 2020. nearly 32 million cases worldwide were recorded. with a death toll of approximately 1 million cases. As COVID-19 has spread across the world. certain groups of people prove more susceptible than others. Elderly patients and people with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease or diabetes are more likely to experience or even suffer from serious diseases. As a population. senior citizens take more medicines than young people. Similarly. people with chronic illnesses who are several taking drugs to control their illness. All this poses a significant query in managing COVID-19 cases: can a standard drug regimen be paired with one or more experimental drugs? For example. some of the most widely prescribed medicines—including antibacterial drugs. antifungals. heart-related medications. neuroleptics. contraceptives. and sedatives—can have extensive and often even severe interactions with some of the experimental COVID-19 therapy. Therefore. to reduce the morbidity and mortality rate associated with COVID-19. this issue needs to be answered in detail. This review addressed the key points related to the drug-drug and drug-disease interaction in patients with COVID-19.

1091181,Fabrication and Evaluation of Oral Multi-Particulate Tablets of Proton Pump Inhibitors: Esomeprazole as a Model,2020,Radhwan N Al-Zidan and Saad M Majeed and Mohammed K Al-Shaheen,11,,11,487-492,Medknow Publications,Esomeprazole. a proton pump inhibitor. inhibits gastric acid secretion and used to treat many acid-related gastric/duodenal diseases in adults and children. The present article investigated the development of an oral delayedrelease multi-particulate tablet of Esomeprazole. which consists of enteric coated pellets of esomeprazole. Such dosage form offers the healthcare providers a higher dosage flexibility to give the appropriate dose regarding the patient age and the disease state of the patient. In addition. the proposed dosage form enhances the physicochemical stability of coated drug by forming multi-unite pellets system (MUPS)®. Compression of coated pellets is an arduous process and requires the optimization of several formulations and processing variables; among it includes size. nature. and amount of tableting additives as well as the applied compression force. In this study. several trials were executed to prepare a satisfactory product by using the direct compression method with different directly compressible fillers. having suitable cushioning properties. like spray dried lactose. microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). and dibasic calcium phosphate. In this study. it was found that adding up to 49% of (MCC) offered greater protection to the coated pellets. and greatly maintained the integrity of the multiparticulate tablet—even under a compression force of about 3 tons. This research work led to successful formulation of esomeprazole delayed release multi-particulate tablets containing enteric coated pellets equivalent to 20 mg of esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate using the direct compression method.,True,Bk2jl0QAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Radhwan_Al-Zidan/publication/348096762_Fabrication_and_Evaluation_of_Oral_Multi-Particulate_Tablets_of_Proton_Pump_Inhibitors_Esomeprazole_as_a_Model/links/5feed582a6fdccdcb81ebcd9/Fabrication-and-Evaluation-of-Oral-Multi-Particulate-Tablets-of-Proton-Pump-Inhibitors-Esomeprazole-as-a-Model.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Radhwan_Al-Zidan/publication/348096762_Fabrication_and_Evaluation_of_Oral_Multi-Particulate_Tablets_of_Proton_Pump_Inhibitors_Esomeprazole_as_a_Model/links/5feed582a6fdccdcb81ebcd9/Fabrication-and-Evaluation-of-Oral-Multi-Particulate-Tablets-of-Proton-Pump-Inhibitors-Esomeprazole-as-a-Model.pdf,0,0,0

Al-Zidan,,,,,,Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease with autoimmune basis. RA causes hyper-inflammatory milieu within the joints. due to the unrestrained activity of the immune cells such as T. and B cells.Regulatory T cells (Tregs) control the activity of a broad range of immune cells. including effector T cells (Teff). in the periphery and prevent selfrecognition of the body cells and tissues.

1091200,Indigenous knowledge of terrace management in Paundi Khola watershed. Lamjung district. Nepal,2004,Karun Pandit and Mohan K Balla,2,Himalayan Journal of Sciences,3,33-36,,The study was carried out in the Paundi Khola watershed. Lamjung district. with the objective of evaluating the indigenous knowledge of terrace management. Various biophysical practices and land husbandry practices were recorded through field observation. A questionnaire survey and group discussions were also undertaken to acquire relevant information. It was found that terrace width and riser height correlated with slope angle negatively and positively. respectively. Outward-sloped terraces were common in the higher slope classes. Bund plantation was rarely observed in the irrigated fields. Paddy was the preferred crop wherever sufficient water was available. Paddy cultivation on unstable slopes without proper irrigation and drainage systems was the usual cause of slumping. Despite the failure of terraces or slopes in areas with deep-seated slides. farmers continued paddy cultivation by temporarily supporting and stabilizing the terraces until this was no longer feasible and major slope failure occurred. Gradual replacement of paddy by other more appropriate upland crops may sort out this problem to some extent.

1091201,Morphological study of adult female Aedes species from the Amravati District of Maharashtra and its role as,,Hemlata Pradeep Nandurkar,,,,,,Amravati is a major district from Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. This tropical region shows extreme cold and extreme high temperatures during winter and summer seasons. The temperature reaches beyond a level of 45oC with lot of humidity during summer season. This climate favors to flourish mosquitoes breeding and in turn invites various mosquito borne diseases. Mosquito plays an important role in transmission of various diseases. Mosquitoes transmit diseases like Malaria. Filaria. Dengue Chikungunya (CHIK). Japanese Encephalitis and many more leading towards huge economic loss throughout the world. As Vidarbha is basically a tropical region where temperature. National Vector borne Disease Control Programme is based on the pioneer step of identification of mosquitoes to control mosquito borne diseases. Entomological surveillance for dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is used to evaluate control programmes. Presence of Aedes (Ae.) aegypti spells the risk of DF/CHIK outbreaks in the area. its population prevalence is of importance for long-term vector control and disease prevention. Aedes can be easily identified due to white and black bands on the body as well as legs. but the species involved in transmission of different Aedes borne diseases need proper identification. A total of 111 species of Aedes were recorded In India. Two major species of Aedes recorded in the area are Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus as vectors.,True,6JBTGX4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.653.882&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.653.882&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

A escolha das substâncias com atividade antimicrobiana que serão incorporadas aos cosméticos para prevenir a contaminação deve ser feita de forma criteriosa. em concentrações adequadas que garantam eficácia e segurança. Os conservantes químicos disponíveis no mercado apresentam. sem exceção. algum risco de hipersensibilidade e. por isso esforços têm sido direcionados para o desenvolvimento de compostos naturais com atividade antimicrobiana com o propósito de reduzir ou substituir conservantes químicos tradicionais. Os óleos essenciais transformaram-se em géis. cremes. loções e hoje. estudos demonstram o seu possível uso como agentes conservantes naturais. Este trabalho tem o objetivo de verificar se o óleo de alecrim (Rosmarinus officinalis) é eficaz como conservante para bases cosméticas comparado aos conservantes químicos metil e propil parabenos. O método utilizado foi o teste de difusão em ágar onde utilizaram-se diferentes concentrações dos conservantes contra a bactéria Escherichia coli e o fungo Candida albicans. Os resultados indicaram que o óleo essencial de alecrim apresenta potencial intermediário de atividade bacteriostática. uma vez que produziu halos de inibição. porém menores do que os produzidos pelos parabenos.

1091225,The effect of Silver Bio-Nanoparticles Synthesized by Curcuma longa L. on pathogenic fungi,2017,Hussein R.Mahmood Saba A. Ziadi,,,,,,Silver has reported as inhibitor agent on medical and industrial fungi. The first light implementation of silver and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) involves in medical industrialization such as ointments to get rid of the infection of open wounds and burns. over and above these biologically synthesized nanoparticles are highly toxic against human pathogens that showed resistance to different medications. This research encompassed the test of Curcuma longa L extract and Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles by Curcuma longa L against four pathogenic fungi Aspergillus niger. P. nigricans. P. iticalum and Penicillum sp. Curcuma longa extract has no influence on A. niger growth rate in comparison with the other three fungi where the radial growth rate averged (7.6. 8.3. 2.8) cm for the three fungi abovementioned sequentially. The synthesis of silver nanoparticles examined by the alteration of color (color changed to yellow) and for the confirmation of AgNPs synthesis. UV-Vis spectroscopy was exploited for this destination at absorption between (291.5-663.5) nm and its antifungal action was evaluated. AgNPs has been the greatest inhibition ability. where the growth rate of penicillum. sp was tremendously inhibited (0.4) cm. The uttermost radial growth of P. nigricans and P. iticalum reached (6. 3. 5. 4) cm. while A. niger was less susceptible compared to control.

Over the shrimp culture period. two ponds were selected from two farms. and 19 shrimp specimens were caught randomly each month from each pond. The specimens were immediately transferred to lab for further investigation. After recording abnormal signs including color change of cuticle and gills. presence of white or black spots on the body. the specimens were studied for bacterial. fungal and parasitic infections. Bacterial infections included Citobacter. Pseudomonas. Aeromonas. Actinobacter. Proteus. Vibrio alginolyticus. V. harveyi. V. parahaemolyticus. V. spelendidus and Vibrio sp. Fungal infections of the cultured P. indicus included Fuzarium spp.. Mucor. Cladosporium. Aspergillus spp.. Penicllinium spp.. sterilized hyphae and yeast. The parasites found included Zoothamnium. Epistylis. andVorticella. Since the second month of shrimp culture onwards around 10-65% of shrimps showed white and opaque spots on abdominal muscle which started from the sixth segment. Sometimes. the dots covered the whole abdomen. giving the shrimps a cooked look and a yellowish watery sac on hepatopancreas under the carapace of the specimens could be observed. There was no evidence of disease agents based on microbial. parasitic and environmental studies. The food which was used for shrimp culture was analyzed and showed anion and cation imbalance.

1091273,Study of Posterior Condylar Foramen in Dry Human Skulls,2017,Shyamkishore K Borkute M,,Indian Journal of Clinical Anatomy and Physiology,,,,Introduction: Posterior condylar foramen is the most constantly present emissary foramen in human skull. It is also considered as largest emissary foramen present in humans. Of the two large emissary veins of posterior cranial fossa. one of them ie posterior condylar vein passes through posterior condylar foramen. Condylar veins are also important channels of venous drainage for posterior cranial fossa region. Emissary veins are important in equalising intracranial pressure. They can act as safety valves in cerebral congestion.Method: Material for this study consists of 100 dry adult skulls obtained from two teaching institutes in Maharashtra state. These skulls were carefully observed for posterior condylar foramen. Whether foramen was present unilaterally or bilaterally or was absent on both sides was noted.Result: Posterior condylar foramen was present on both sides (bilaterally) in 58 skulls. In 15 skulls it was present only on right side where as in 10 skulls it was present only on left side. Foramen was found to be absent on both sides in 17 skulls. When present unilaterally it was more common on right side than left.Conclusion: Posterior condylar foramen was not only important from anthropological point of view but also important for clinicians and surgeons who deal with posterior cranial fossa region. Condylar vein (posterior) and posterior condylar foramen (canal) both are important surgical landmarks for different skull base approaches described. Enlarged posterior condylar canal can be wrongly interpreted as pathological condition in certain radiological procedures like MRI.,True,PRFvuA4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1,https://www.academia.edu/download/52603579/IJCAP_41_44-47.pdf,11376572527710303957,/scholar?cites=11376572527710303957,,https://www.academia.edu/download/52603579/IJCAP_41_44-47.pdf,0,0,0

Two models propose that these interactions are co-evolutionary processes in such a way that equilibrium is never reached. In one model. known as “arms race”. new alleles in relevant genes are fixed in both host and pathogens by directional positive selection. producing recurrent and alternating selective sweeps. In the other model. known as“trench warfare”. persistent dynamic fluctuations in allele frequencies are sustained by balancing selection.

1091321,HIGH ENERGY ELECTRON BEAM (HEEB) PROCESSING OF ADVANCED MATERIALS,,VR Dave and DL Goodman and M Farnush and TW Eagar and KC Russell,,,,,,High Energy Electron Beams (HEEBs) offer a unique heat source that may be used for a wide variety of materials processing applications. The unique physical characteristics that make HEEB-based processing so attractive are: in-depth energy penetration. very high average power levels. shock generation capabilities. and potential for atmospheric or inert gas environment operations. High energy electrons will penetrate several millimeters into most materials. allowing for subsurface heat treatment. Rapid energy deposition produces moderate to strong shocks in many materials. and many potential applications exist that exploit this phenomenon. The operating parameters of pulsed power accelerators vary. but typical beam energies are a few MeV. beam currents are several hundred amperes. pulse durations are tens of nanoseconds. and repetition rates can be as high as a few kilohertz. The average power levels obtainable with these operating parameters range from a few hundred kilowatts to well into the megawatt range. The surface heat fluxes can be as high as 1 o6-1Q9 watts I cm2. Such high power levels mean that HEEB processing is ideal for net shape casting applications. and metal melting rates may be as high as 1000 lbs. I hr. The fabrication of graded alloy components is discussed as one example of such a net shape manufacturing process. Other applications include heat treatment. surface treatment. shock hardening. powder processing. dynamic powder consolidation. deep penetration brazing. and ceramic component tempering.

Arabidopsis thaliana and Thellungiella salsuginea were used to investigate the differential responses to iron deficiency of these two species. Plants were cultivated in hydroponic medium containing 5 or 0 μM Fe. for 10 days. Results showed that rosette biomass was more reduced in T. salsuginea than in A. thaliana when grown on Fe-deficient medium. As a marker for iron deficiency tolerance. the induction of ferric chelate reductase (FCR) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activities was observed only in A. thaliana roots. In addition. we found that the accumulation of phenolic acids in roots of N1438 ecotype of A. thaliana was stimulated by Fe deficiency. Furthermore. an increase of flavonoids content in the root and exudates was observed under Fe-deficiency in this ecotype. Unlike other abiotic stresses. it appears that iron deficiency effects were more pronounced in Thellungiella than in Arabidopsis. The higher tolerance of the Arabidopsis plant to iron deficiency may be due to the metabolic changes occurring in the roots.,True,6akgcYkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-2a487ca4-f647-4a4e-9638-9739f67ebfdd,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-2a487ca4-f647-4a4e-9638-9739f67ebfdd/c/3.pdf,0,0,0

J,,106-110,,The diversity of flower color and shape as well as their inheritance is studied in L. grandiflorum Desf. Range of flower colors includes various shades of red. such as crimson and copper. which are typical for native populations. as well as pink. apricot. light apricot. white and lilac colors. Pink color was revealed as spontaneous mutation in crimson-flowered sample. Apricot color was found in M2 among copper-flowered plants after seed treatment with ethyl methane sulfonate. Light apricot color was derived from segregating population after crossing pink and apricot lines. Lilac color was identified in F1 plants. when crimson or copper lines crossed with white-flowered line. It is supposed that two genetic systems are involved in controlling flower color. A three-locus system of non-allelic genes. where the recessive homozygote of one of them suppresses the action of another gene is one of them. Besides. there is a series of alleles of one of the loci. where one of the alleles does not completely dominate the others. In addition to the open flower shape typical for this species. two new flower shapes–stellate and carnation–are identified. Stellate corolla is characterized by twisting the edges of the petals inside. This trait has a special appearance in the flowers of apricot and light apricot colors. A flowers of carnation type of different colors have the reduced in length and crimped petals. Stellate shape of flower in apricot777-and light apricot-petalled lines is inherited as monogenic recessive trait. while carnation shape of corolla of different colors is controlled by two uniquely acting genes.

The F1 hybrid held an intermediate position between the parents. but approached the parental line with a large number of ray flowers. The average value of the number of petals in F2 was close to F1.

IgM. and IgA). complement proteins (C3 and C4) were determined and analyzed for normal pregnant. abortion and control groups by using Single Radial Immunodiffusion (SRID) technique. The results demonstrated that concentration of IgG levels in abortion differed significantly in compare to normal pregnancy (p≤ 0.05). while there were no significant differences in IgM and IgA serum levels among groups (p> 0.05). Also. statistical analysis revealed that serum levels of C3 and C4 significantly decreased in abortion group compared to normal pregnant and non-pregnant groups (p≤ 0.05). Concluded that complement proteins (C3 andC4) are a good defense line during normal pregnancy. sometime activation (hyper-consuming) of complement elements may provoke spontaneous abortion. while immunoglobulins are a little role in inducing of miscarriage in pregnant women.,True,819vK1sAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,http://kjar.spu.edu.iq/index.php/kjar/article/view/210,,,,https://kjar.spu.edu.iq/index.php/kjar/article/download/210/172,0,0,0

In order to explore the fungal composition and diversity in Haibat Sultan Mountain soil. PCR used based cloning and sequencing of Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) of genome. Soil samples were collected from different depth points (1. 5 to 10 cm depth) and fungal universal primers targeting ITS2 region of the fungal genome were used to assess their diversity in soil samples. More than 1400 fungal clones were sequenced and led to detect total of 89 OTUs in all samples. The majority of the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belong to the Ascomycota (67.4%). the second most constituents of soil samples were Basidiomycota with (28.1%). and few members of Zygomycota were detected. Concluded that fungal richness and diversity were abundant at the depth of 1 cm and reached their peak at the depth of 5 cm. while at the depth of 10 cm. the fungal communities decreased. The highest Chao1 and Shannon value were obtained at the soil depth of 5 cm followed by soil depth 1cm. whereas the lowest value was detected in soil depth 10 cm. Results highlight the variations of fungal diversity at different depth points. Thus. further studies are needed to expand knowledge about fungi communities in soil through using high-throughput sequencing to improve detection fungi in soil,True,819vK1sAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,http://www.zancojournals.su.edu.krd/index.php/JPAS/article/view/2068,,,,http://www.zancojournals.su.edu.krd/index.php/JPAS/article/download/2068/1412,0,0,0

In the present study. Internal Transcribed Spacer ITS rDNA-based investigations of fungal communities in Dukan Lake were conducted from two collection sites using large-scale clonal Sanger sequencing. Herein we report for the first time. the composition of fungal communities in water samples of Dukan Lake through cloning/sequencing method. A total of 576 clones were obtained from ITS gene library and resulted in retrieving of 33 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The majority of clone sequences belonged to Ascomycota while members of other fungal phyla were recovered at much lower frequencies. Molecular diversity analysis in Dukan Lake revealed the existence of fungi belonged to Pleosporales. Hypocreales. Helotiales. Mortierellales. Eurotiales. whereas Capnodiales. Onygenales. Pezizales. and Xylariales were detected in relatively minor abundances in the Dukan Lake ecosystem. In conclusion. molecular techniques using ITS rDNA-based PCR cloning/sequencing is currently used as an effective tool to investigate the complex fungal communities in the aquatic systems however additional studies using next generation sequencing are needed for descriptive details regarding the occurrence and abundance of fungi in aquatic environments.,True,819vK1sAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kamal_Khidir/publication/325472129_Exploring_Fungal_Diversity_and_distribution_in_Dukan_Freshwater_Lake_Using_ITS_rDNA-based_PCR_Cloning_Sequencing_Article_info_Abstract/links/5b0fef92a6fdcc2daeb2cd97/Exploring-Fungal-Diversity-and-distribution-in-Dukan-Freshwater-Lake-Using-ITS-rDNA-based-PCR-Cloning-Sequencing-Article-info-Abstract.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kamal_Khidir/publication/325472129_Exploring_Fungal_Diversity_and_distribution_in_Dukan_Freshwater_Lake_Using_ITS_rDNA-based_PCR_Cloning_Sequencing_Article_info_Abstract/links/5b0fef92a6fdcc2daeb2cd97/Exploring-Fungal-Diversity-and-distribution-in-Dukan-Freshwater-Lake-Using-ITS-rDNA-based-PCR-Cloning-Sequencing-Article-info-Abstract.pdf,0,0,0

The two largest stressors introduced by agriculture are phosphorus and fine sediment. The combined impacts of the multiple stressor and relative strength of each individual stressor needs to be understand. A Number of ecological response variables were tested through a field mesocosm experiment. including algal and ecosystem variables: (1) The subsidy-stress for phosphorus and sediment (where at first. an ecological variable increases positively with the increased level of phosphorus and sediment until very high levels are reached. when negative effects would be expected); (2) Whether the stressors work individually or as multiple stressors and whether they interact; (2.a) Three ecological guilds of algae (‘low profile’ growth form. ‘high profile’ growth form. ‘motile’ growth form) were used in order to test whether the high profile growth form decreases and motile growth form increases with increase of sediment deposition. or whether (2.b) Both high profile growth form and motile growth form increase with increase concentration of phosphorus. Most species showed subsidy stress responses for the gradient of phosphorus. but for the gradient of sediment the response was negative.

Conservation management in the buffer and transition zones of Biosphere Reserves play an important role in ensuring enhanced core zone protection. Tambolongan and Polassi are two islands located in the administrative region of South Sulawesi. Indonesia. and part of the transition zone area of UNESCO’s Taka Bonerate-Kepulauan Selayar (TBKS) Biosphere Reserve (BR). These two islands can be considered as some of the most populated islands in the region. containing a variety of human activities. These human activities. such as the ever expanding agriculture and the building of human habitation have put pressures toward ecosystem and species conservation in the BR. Bird are often the focus of conservation efforts. due to their roles in supporting the ecological functioning of their habitats. This study aims to provide baseline data of bird diversity in Tambolongan and Polassi that can be used as a proxy indicator of ecosystem health and input to conservation strategies within the BR area. A Visual Encounter Survey (VES) method is used to examine bird diversity index. Results from the observation recorded a total of 29 species were found in both islands. with 5 listed as protected species and 3 categorized as migratory species. The comparison between the two islands showed that the bird diversity index (H’) differs only slightly (H’Tambolongan= 2.98; H’Polassi= 2.71).

Implementation of animal welfare in tiger sanctuary. Barumun Nagari Wildlife Sanctuary. North Sumatra. Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 2790-2795. The accelerated growth in the development of economic and social infrastructure has drastically diminished the population of Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) and its habitat. As a result. conflicts between tigers and humans are increasing rapidly in recent years. The wild tigers in conflict. such as those that attack humans and livestock. are usually killed or captured. while those who cannot return to the forest due to injury or illness are then translocated to the zoo. The increasing number of human and tiger conflicts raises the need for special facilities. such as sanctuaries. to recover the condition of the tigers. before they are released to the wild. This study aimed to examine the aspects of welfare management and assess the level of welfare of the tigers kept in the sanctuary at the Barumun Nagari Wildlife Sanctuary (BNWS) in North Sumatra. Indonesia. The study was carried out from March to April 2019. while data collection was carried out by literature studies. field observation on implementation of five animal welfare parameters. and self-assessment by the manager of the sanctuary.

Camellia sinensis. Green tea extract is bioflavonoid-rich compound. with several phenol groups. The dominant polyphynol (catechin) in green tea is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) which is a potent antioxidant. In the case of breast cancer. catechins were in fact shown to interfere with the binding of estrogen to estrogen receptors. This study evaluated the green tea extract effect on breast cancer patients using morphological and immunocytochemical techniques. It included 3 groups. 2 treated groups and one control group. Chemotherapy for 6 cycles was administered plus 1000mg green tea extract/day or alone. Blood smears were applied from both control and treated groups either preradicalmastectomy. or post 3 and 6 cycles of treatment. Apoptotic and antiangiogenic effects were revealed through Leishman’s stain and immunocytochemical technique of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB). Morphological results using Leishman’s stain illustrated that the apoptosis in blood smears of women administered with green tea extract was more prominent than that of their corresponding without green tea extract administration or of control women. Immunocytochemical findings showed that there was a decrease in VEGF & NFkB in women administered green tea extract as compared with their partners of control group as well as those treated with chemotherapy alone. In conclusion. green tea played a dual role in decreasing the angiogenesis while it increased apoptosis. This revealed that green tea as adjuvant therapy showed a positive effect.,True,ODxTp5kAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,http://www.egyseb.net/fulltext/3-1430777800.pdf,,,,http://www.egyseb.net/fulltext/3-1430777800.pdf,0,0,0

1091481,Uji Toksisitas Fraksi Ekstrak Metanol Daun Saga (Abrus precatorius L.) Terhadap Artemia salina Leach. Dan Profil Kandungan Kimia Fraksi Teraktif,2012,Kurnia Ritma Dhanti,,,,,UNS (Sebelas Maret University),Kanker merupakan salah satu penyakit mematikan di negara berkembang. termasuk Indonesia. Namun. penanganan penyakit kanker masih banyak menimbulkan efek samping. Untuk itu. perlu dikembangkan obat dari bahan alami yang dapat meminimalisir timbulnya efek samping. Ekstrak metanol daun saga (Abrus precatorius L.) bersifat toksik terhadap larva Artemia salina Leach dengan metode Brine Shrimp Lethality Test (BST). Tujuan penelitian ini adalah menentukan nilai LC50¬-24jam fraksi teraktif ekstrak metanol daun saga dan mengetahui profil kandungan senyawa kimianya. Ekstrak metanol daun saga dipartisi dengan pelarut etanol hingga terbentuk bagian larut dan tidak larut etanol. Kedua bagian tersebut diuji dengan 5 kali ulangan dan 3 replikasi yang masing-masing menggunakan 10 ekor larva A. salina. Bagian yang lebih aktif difraksinasi dengan metode kromatografi lapis tipis preparatif (KLTP). hingga didapat 6 fraksi. Masing-masing fraksi diujikan dengan BST dan fraksi teraktif dideteksi kandungan senyawa kimia dengan deteksi semprot spesifik. Bagian larut etanol menyebabkan persentase kematian yang lebih tinggi daripada bagian tidak larut. Fraksi dengan persentase kematian tertinggi adalah fraksi II dengan nilai LC¬ 50 sebesar 4.786 ppm. Senyawa yang diduga menyebabkan sifat toksik fraksi II bagian larut etanol ekstrak metanol daun saga termasuk dalam golongan senyawa alkaloid dengan nilai Rf 0. 4; 0. 54 dan 0. 7.

There are different definitions of leucism. with some authors referring to it as partial albinism (Rodríguez-Pinilla & Gómez-Martínez 2011; da Costa et al. 2013; Erickson & Kaefer 2015). However. true albinos are easily differentiated. because they lack pigmentation and feature red or pinkish eyes. while leucistic animals have reduced/absent coloration but with normal eye pigmentation (Krecsak 2008; Turner 2011). These mutations are a relatively rare phenomenon but have been reported for many different animal groups (birds: Sage 1962; mammals: Fertl & Rosel 2009; amphibians: Eagleson et al. 2010; reptiles: da Costa et al. 2013). Reports of albino and leucistic marine turtles refer mostly to hatchlings found in nests during monitoring campaigns. Most of the accounts are of a few individuals per nest. usually associated with other physical abnormalities such as supernumerary scutes or skull deformities (Türkozan & Durmuş 2001; Ibarra & Gasca 2009; Bárcenas-Ibarra et al. 2015). For green turtles (Chelonia mydas). these accounts are uncommon but widespread throughout their distribution range (Table 1). The largest number of albino hatchlings reported from a single clutch was of 29 (including dead embryos and dead-in-shell hatchlings). from Juno Beach. Florida (Perrault & Coppenrath 2019).Here we report all cases of albino and leucistic hatchling green turtles recorded at Poilão Island. Bijagós Archipelago. Guinea-Bissau.

Razões para a presença de lagartixas-da-Madeira (Teira dugessi) em ninhos de cagarra (Calonectris borealis) na Selvagem Grande,2017,Fernando Miguel Madeira Ferreira Esteves,,,,,,Os répteis são os vertebrados não voadores mais comuns em ilhas oceânicas. vivendo muitas vezes associados a colónias de aves marinhas. onde exploram os recursos criados pelas aves. ou até mesmo as próprias aves.  A Selvagem Grande é uma importante colónia de aves marinhas. sendo uma delas a cagarra. Calonectris borealis. que nidifica em cavidades rochosas. Nos ninhos desta espécie existe uma grande concentração de invertebrados. sendo muitos deles ectoparasitas das aves. Na Selvagem Grande existe também uma espécie de lacertídeo. a lagartixa-da-Madeira. Teira dugesii. É uma espécie omnívora. conhecida por predar crias e ovos de cagarra. que pode ser encontrada frequentemente nos ninhos desta ave.  Tal como os restantes lacertídeos. a lagartixa-da-Madeira é uma espécie diurna. heliotérmica e termófila. dependendo de temperaturas altas para a sua atividade. No entanto. é comum encontrar lagartixas ativas de noite nos ninhos de cagarra.  Como as cagarras retornam à noite a terra para alimentar as crias. as lagartixas poderão estar a alargar o seu ciclo de atividade diário. de forma a aproveitar os restos de alimento. No entanto. é plausível que possam também utilizar o calor dos ninhos. e das próprias aves. para manter uma temperatura corporal mais elevada durante a atividade noturna.

1091554,Emerging links between herpes viruses and Alzheimer’s disease pathology,2018,AO Sasmita and A Methi and P Kislai,12,J. Mol. Genet. Med,,388,,Over 3.7 billion people worldwide under the age of 50 are estimated to have some form of Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in their lifetime. Despite mostly presenting as asymptomatic. HSV infection has been associated with worsening symptoms and biological conditions in various diseases. some of which are neurological. such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This mini-review thus aims to showcase the varying researches carried out in the past decades which sought the connection between the infection and the neurodegenerative disease. Various members of the Herpes viridae family have been associated with worsening AD pathology and symptoms. namely HSV-1. HSV-2. human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6). and HHV-7. The virus affects many aspects of the nervous system to promote neurodegeneration. including fragmentation of amyloid precursor proteins (APP). inducing production of excess amyloid beta (Aβ) in response to the viral infection. and formation of tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). all of which point to further degeneration of the nervous system structures and cognitive decline in AD patients. HSV has been significantly reported to induce concurrent alterations in the context of AD. Although more in-depth analysis still needs to be done to consider other factors such as age. viral load. and the degree of neurodegeneration. HSV infection remains an interesting drug target through the means of antivirals in ameliorating a certain degree of neurodegeneration. cognitive decline. and memory loss in AD.,True,Uff3bysAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Sasmita/publication/330344972_Emerging_Links_between_Herpesviruses_and_Alzheimer's_Disease_Pathology/links/5c3a07d1299bf12be3c2a462/Emerging-Links-between-Herpesviruses-and-Alzheimers-Disease-Pathology.pdf,16973320555137665754,/scholar?cites=16973320555137665754,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Sasmita/publication/330344972_Emerging_Links_between_Herpesviruses_and_Alzheimer's_Disease_Pathology/links/5c3a07d1299bf12be3c2a462/Emerging-Links-between-Herpesviruses-and-Alzheimers-Disease-Pathology.pdf,0,0,0

This study was conducted to assess and evaluate the heavy metal content of selected rice and vegetable crops near mining areas in Sta. Cruz. Zambales. Physico-chemical characteristics of the soil samples and heavy metal content of the crops were examined and analysed by CRL Laboratory and related to the growth performance of the selected agricultural crops of the study area to ascertain the effects of excess nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr). Results showed that Ni and Cr concentration on both pre and post-assessments were higher than the accepted standard limit of Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) and European Union Standards; additionally. the findings of the study revealed significant differences based on t-test at alpha level of 0.05. On the other hand. Pearson-r correlation showed a negative correlation between Ni concentration and growth performances of the four vegetable crops. Another statistical treatment was employed and one-way analysis of variance at alpha level of 0.05 showed a significant difference between each growth performance in relation to Ni as well as Cr concentration.

Hal ini disebabkan oleh beberapa faktor. diantaranya adalah semakin maraknya perburuan liar. rusaknya habitat alamnya yang disebabkan oleh konversi hutan yang cenderung tidak terkendali. Populasi kecil lebih rentan pada penurunan keragaman genetik karena efek inbreeding serta terfiksasinya beberapa alela tertentu dalam populasi sehingga hewan tersebut menjadi monomorf dan mengalami penurunan kemampuan berevolusi atau adaptasinya pada lingkungan yang berubah. Selain itu berkurangnya populasi. faktor lain adalah terjadinya fragmentasi suatu habitat yang akan mendorong putusnya aliran gen (gen flow) dan meningkatnya genetic drift.

1091573,Evaluating insecticide exposure risk for grassland wildlife on public lands,2016,Nicole M Davros and Katelin Goebel,,Summaries of Wildlife Research Findings,,328-339,,Increasing evidence suggests that acute toxicity to pesticides may be more important than agricultural intensity in explaining declines in grassland-dependent wildlife. Although neonicotinoids (systemic insecticides routinely used on corn and soybeans) are currently under scrutiny for their effects on birds and pollinators. other insecticides are commonly used in Minnesota’s farmland regions that may also have negative effects on non-target organisms. Minnesota Department of Natural Resource (MNDNR) wildlife managers and members of the public have reported concerns about foliar-application insecticides in particular. Such insecticides are used on a variety of crops but their use has been especially important for controlling soybean aphid outbreaks in Minnesota’s farmland regions. Concerns have previously been raised about the impacts of chlorpyrifos. a broad-spectrum organophosphate. and other foliar-application insecticides on water quality and human health. prompting the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) to release guidelines for voluntary best management practices for their use. Although lab studies have shown chlorpyrifos and other insecticides used to target aphids are highly toxic to non-target organisms. including economically important game species and pollinators. fewer studies have investigated the environmentally-relevant exposure risk of free-ranging wildlife to these chemicals. Our research project will assess the direct and indirect exposure risk of grassland wildlife to common soybean aphid insecticides along a gradient from soybean field edge to grassland interior.

1091576,EVALUATING GRASSLAND WILDLIFE EXPOSURE TO SOYBEAN APHID INSECTICIDES ON PUBLIC LANDS IN MINNESOTA,,Katelin Goebel and Nicole M Davros,,,,,,Increasing evidence suggests that pesticides may be an important factor explaining declines in grassland-dependent wildlife in agricultural landscapes. Minnesota Department of Natural Resource (MNDNR) wildlife managers and members of the public have reported concerns about foliar-application insecticides in particular. Such insecticides are used on a variety of crops but their use has been especially important for controlling soybean aphid outbreaks in Minnesota. Concerns have been raised about the impacts of chlorpyrifos. a broad-spectrum organophosphate. and other foliar-application insecticides on water quality and human health. prompting the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) to release guidelines for voluntary best management practices for their use. Although lab studies have shown chlorpyrifos and other insecticides used to target aphids are highly toxic to non-target organisms. including economically important game species and pollinators. few studies have investigated the environmentally-relevant exposure of free-ranging wildlife to these chemicals. Our objective was to assess the direct and indirect exposure of grassland wildlife to the 3 most common soybean aphid insecticides (ie. chlorpyrifos. lambda-cyhalothrin. and bifenthrin) along a gradient from soybean field edge to grassland interior. During summer 2017 and 2018. we sampled 5 treatment and 4 control sites across western and southern Minnesota. We detected chlorpyrifos at all distances examined (0-400 m) at both treatment and control sites. suggesting that some background level of chlorpyrifos exposure is occurring in the environment regardless of …,True,aoeCJ1sAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/wildlife/research/summaries/2018/habitats/2018habitat001.pdf,,,,https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/wildlife/research/summaries/2018/habitats/2018habitat001.pdf,0,0,0

Zaradi sposobnosti letenja lahko premagujejo zelo velike razdalje. Ker so potencialni prenašalci patogenih mikroorganizmov. lahko le-te razširjajo po obsežnem geografskem območju. Mikrobiota v ptičjem črevesju. na njihovi koži in v dihalih. vpliva tudi na fiziološko stanje ptic. Informacije o njeni diverziteti so zato pomembne za preprečevanje širjenja patogenih mikroorganizmov. kot tudi za ohranjanje ogroženih vrst ptic. Ptičem smo vzeli brise na treh telesnih območjih: podperut. kloaka in sapišče.

Within the last few decades. findings from epidemiological and experimental studies support the notion that allergic sensitization is not only dependent on the genetics of the host and environmental factors. but also on intrinsic features of the allergenic source itself. In this review. we summarize the current concepts and newest advances in research focusing on the initial mechanisms inducing pollen sensitization. Pollen allergens are embedded in a complex and heterogeneous matrix composed of a myriad of bioactive molecules that are co-delivered during the allergic sensitization. Surprisingly. several purified allergens were shown to lack inherent sensitizing potential. Thus. growing evidence supports an essential role of pollen-derived components co-delivered with the allergens in the initiation of allergic …,True,IBCeNr8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13601-020-00341-y,16643742898496279611,/scholar?cites=16643742898496279611,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13601-020-00341-y,0,0,0

In order to overcome the huge socio-economic burden associated with allergic diseases. allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) as a curative strategy to manage the disease was introduced. Still. many hurdles related to this treatment exist making AIT not the patients´ first choice. To improve the current situation. the development of hypoallergen-based drug products has raised attention in the last decade. Herein. we investigated the efficacy of the novel AIT candidate BM4. a hypoallergenic variant of Bet v 1. to induce treatment-relevant cross-reactive Bet v 1-specific IgG antibodies in two different mammals. Wistar rats and New Zealand White rabbits. We further analyzed the cross-reactivity of BM4-induced Wistar rat antibodies with the birch pollen-associated food allergens Mal d 1 and Cor a 1. and the functional capability of the induced antibodies to act as IgE-blocking IgG antibodies. ELISA was used to determine the titers of rat IgG1. IgG2a. IgG2b. and IgE. as well as rabbit IgG and IgE antibodies. To address the functional relevance of the induced IgG antibodies. the capacity of rat sera to suppress binding of human IgE to Bet v 1 was investigated by using an inhibition ELISA and an IgE-facilitated allergen-binding inhibition assay. We found that the treatment with BM4 induced elevated Bet v 1-specific IgG antibody titers in both mammalian species. In Wistar rats. high BM4-specific IgG1.

Like most stem cells long-term expansion of muscle progenitors in vitro is troublesome. The in vivo muscle regeneration skills are quickly lost when culturing in vitro. that prevents the potential applications of muscle derived cells in cell-based therapies. Selenium is an integral a part of the enzyme antioxidant. that is an inhibitor enzyme that helps to regulate levels of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides that are created throughout normal metabolic activity. Expanded muscle progenitors will replenish the endogenous stem cell pool and can repair multiple rounds of muscle injuries in vivo after a single transplantation.

In the present study. we aimed to investigate the effect of microwave drying conditions on the rehydration process of Algerian truffles. Previously dried truffles. at different microwave power output (350. 500 and 650 Watt) and weights (100 and 150 g) have been utilized to analyses and to model the rehydration kinetics. Among the six used empirical models. Weibull model has been the most fitted model to all the treated samples. Microwave power output and sample weight were found to have an effect on truffles during drying. and consequently on their rehydration capacity. The high samples amount has decreased the effects of microwave drying by decreasing the density of treatment. also. the high-power output has probably reduced the time of evaporation. and thus more preservation to the dried truffles. These results can be taken into consideration for more industrial applications of microwave drying and subsequent rehydration of truffles.,True,aZYlKlAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1,http://agrifoodscience.com/index.php/TURJAF/article/view/3083,16975818618163848132,/scholar?cites=16975818618163848132,,http://agrifoodscience.com/index.php/TURJAF/article/download/3083/1529,0,0,0

Georg. Natl. Acad. Sci,4,,,Pyrethroid preparation against plant pests named “Antipest” was prepared using natural compound of turpentine. Preparation contains synthetic pyrethroid and turpentine oil. natural compound obtained from plant remains (pine resin). Content of turpentine oil in the composition of “Antipest”’defines the prolonged action of synthetic pyrethroid. As a result. low concentration of the synthetic pyrethroid in the preparation is enough for the whole period of development of pest cycle. The content of pyrethroid (cypermethrin) in the “Antipest” is 40% less than in a widely used imported cypermethrin-containing acaricidal preparation “Arivo”. The results of application of new insectoacaricidal preparation “Antipest” against peach aphids (Mysodes persicae. Hyalopterus pruni) both in laboratory and field conditions are presented in the paper. In lab conditions the optimal effective concentration of “Antipest” working solutions causing maximal mortality of green peach aphids was determined. Effective concentration of the working mixtures of “Antipest” determined under lab conditions were used in the pilot site of peach orchard.

The recently discovered fungal pathogen. Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). has resulted in a surge of experimental investigations because of its potential to impact global salamander biodiversity. However. variation in experimental methodologies could thwart knowledge advancement by introducing confounding factors that make comparisons difficult among studies. Thus. our objective was to evaluate if variation in experimental methods changed inferences made on the pathogenicity of Bsal. We tested whether passage duration of Bsal culture. exposure method of the host to Bsal (water bath vs. skin inoculation). Bsal culturing method (liquid vs. plated). host husbandry conditions (aquatic vs. terrestrial). and skin swabbing frequency influenced diseased-induced mortality in a susceptible host species. the eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens). We found that disease-induced mortality was faster for eastern newts when exposed to a low passage isolate. when newts were housed in terrestrial environments. and if exposure to zoospores occurred via water bath. We did not detect differences in disease-induced mortality between culturing methods or swabbing frequencies. Our results illustrate the need to standardize methods among Bsal experiments.

However. in plants. mating system traits have rarely been tested for signs of senescence. Since reproduction is often resource limited. we might expect outcrossing and selfing taxa to allocate these resources differently. especially as a plant ages. Compared with selfers. outcrossers are expected to produce showy. rewarding flowers that attract pollinators and high‐quality pollen that can successfully compete for ovules. Yet. this resource‐intensive strategy of outcrossers may result in declines in floral allocation and pollen performance metrics. relative to selfers.To explore age‐related changes in reproduction. we measured flower size and pollen germinability over the flowering period for multiple populations of an annual sister species pair.

Para superar suas dificuldades econômicas. recorrem principalmente ao Fundo Monetário Internacional (FMI). bem como aos governos e bancos de países economicamente mais fortes. Como condição para ajuda. entretanto. principalmente na forma de empréstimos. é exigido um corte. politicamente inaceitável. da demanda interna (em valor real). que tende a conduzir a um novo declínio na economia do país afetado. em vez de sua rápida recuperação. Mas a causa desse comportamento singular por parte do credor em potencial não é ganância exagerada ou mesmo interesse próprio. mas antes uma visão há muito difundida de que uma inflação se dá sempre pelo aumento da demanda e pode. por essa razão. ser sempre contida. sem grandes dificuldades. pelo corte de demanda. Sob essa visão. tudo o que está faltando é uma adequada autodisciplina. na economia. por parte do país que busca apoio.“Ele está vivendo além das suas possibilidades.” E quanto mais a demanda for limitada. mais a disciplina (forçada) é utilizada. e mais rapidamente será alcançada a estabilidade de preço.

We call this model-a Vasicek model with a risk factor. Two assumptions for the market price of risk are considered. The first suggests that the market price of risk takes only positive values and the second one only negative values. Using these two assumptions and replacing them into the exact solution of the zero coupon bond's price. we obtain two models for finding of the bonds' prices exact solutions. Two numerical experiments are also introduced. They are made by using fixed values of some of the parameters when other of them are changing in time.

Air classifiers are commonly employed in industrial processes where a large volume of mixed materials with differing physical characteristics need to be separated quickly and efficiently [1].The principle of the rotor’s work is as follows. After entering the machine. the air flows through the classifying rotor in centripetal direction. In the process. the classifying rotor extracts the fines from the feed material. The coarse material is rejected by the classifying rotor. Product fineness is controlled by adjustment of the classifier rotor speed and airflow. One problem in this process is the fact that near the bottom of the rotor. in the center. there exists a region of low velocity. which leads to poor productivity of the classification process.

This study investigated the effect of liquid manure application and aerial irrigation on litter decomposition and AMF colonization in mountain meadowlands. Six intensity levels of irrigation and fertilization were experimentally tested in eleven meadows located in the Swiss Alps. For litter decomposition. a novel teabag approach was followed. AMF root colonization was assessed from field samples and a trap culture experiment. Decomposition measured with tea bag burials was higher under maximal management intensity levels. AMF colonization was 22% lower in high-input compared to low-input plots in the field while in the trap cultures colonization levels depended on the functional plant species group. Our findings shed light on the impact of management intensification in mountain hay meadows on belowground functioning.

Until 2014. pegylated interferon (PEG‐IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) has been the standard therapy for HCV. however. owing to its adverse side effects and very low sustained virologic response (SVR) rates therapeutics trend is shifted toward direct‐acting antivirals. Tripartite motif containing 22 (TRIM22) is a dynamic antiviral protein that can inhibit multiple viruses in vivo. Expression of TRIM22 mRNA has been linked to outcome of PEG‐IFN and ribavirin therapy. where its higher expression leads to rapid virus clearance. However. in terms of therapy with direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) or double DAA. impact of TRIM22 expression is largely unknown. These new drugs show more than 90% of SVR rates and lesser side effects and have proven to be better than IFN …,True,SF47KWQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/apm.13024,1708981317366675340,/scholar?cites=1708981317366675340,,,0,0,0

Due to this unique 2D structure. they have a high surface-to-volume ratio that can be beneficial for delivery of various drugs including therapeutic DNAs and RNAs. In addition. various 2D materials exhibit excellent photothermal conversion efficiency when exposed to the near infrared (NIR) light. Therefore. these 2D nanosheet-based photonic nanomedicine have been gaining tremendous attention as both gene delivering vehicles and photothermal agents. which create synergistic effects in the treatment of different diseases. In this minireview. we briefly provide an overview of the following two parts regarding this type of photonic nanomedicine: (1) mechanism and advantages of nanosheets in gene delivery and photothermal therapy. respectively. (2) mechanism of synergistic effects in nanosheet-mediated combined gene and photothermal therapies and their examples in a few representative nanosheets (e.g.. graphene oxide. black phosphorus. and translational metal dichalcogenide).

1091760,Ontogenic variation in the diet composition of Glossogobius giuris from Taal Lake. Batangas. Philippines,2015,JB Bejer,3,Asia Pacific Journal of Multidisciplinary Research,4,,,Glossogobius giuris is an indigenous fish in Taal Lake and is considered to be very important not only due to its reasonable price but also because unlike any other fish. it contains all the nutrients and essential amino acids. Furthermore. this fish is also suitable candidate for artificial culture in the future. Knowledge on the food habits or diet composition is important in evaluating the feeding success of G. giuris which can lead to successful management of stocks in the future. Based on the relative importance. it was found out that the insect larvae and debris were the most important prey items of the juvenile G. giuris while the nematode was the least important. Among the prey items consumed by the adult G. giuris. crustacean eggs and fish larvae had the highest relative importance while the cladocerans had the lowest importance. This revealed that the small or juvenile G. giuris tended to consume more midge larvae and copepods. The adult fish tended to consume mostly crustacean eggs and fish.The trophic level of the juvenile and adult G. giuris revealed that this fish belongs to the second and third level. Based on the calculated trophic level. it showed that this fish can be carnivore. herbivore and omnivore.

Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah eksperimen dengan ab mix sebagai perlakuan dan aquades sebagai kontrol. Hasil penelitian ini adalah jumlah daun. tinggi tanaman. dan berat basah pada ab mix lebih tinggi daripada aquades (kontrol) karena ab mix menyediakan nutrisi untuk pertumbuhan tanaman sehingga tanaman menjadi tinggi dan membesar dengan daunnya yang tampak lebar. Namun. jumlah benih berkecambah dan viabilitas tanaman pada ab mix lebih rendah daripada aquades (kontrol). yaitu 24. 3% sedangkan aquades (kontrol) 32%. Hal ini karena terdapat garam anorganik pada ab mix yang menghambat perkecambahan benih sehingga membran benih dalam menyerap air menjadi impermeabel.

1091780,Effects of restoration on carbon storage in smelterimpacted industrial barrens,2019,Robyn Rumney,,,,,,Landscape carbon (C) storage is a key component of climate change mitigation. Globally. industrial barrens cover large areas and their restoration can facilitate C storage in otherwise under-utilized sites. while concomitantly enhancing numerous other ecosystem services. I assessed how restoration of smelter impacted barren land enhanced C storage by studying a site in Sudbury. Ontario near a former Ni and Cu metal smelter that ceased operation in 1972. The site was treated by aerial liming. fertilizing. and grass and legume seeding in 1994-1997. followed by jack pine (Pinus banksiana) planting in the upland areas in 1997-2001. Forty-five 0.1 ha size plots were selected across restored and untreated adjoining areas. 32 in exposed upland industrial barrens and 13 in sheltered lowland valleys. The focus of my study was on upland industrial barrens. which exhibited severe site conditions and little natural regrowth. I measured the amount of C in coarse woody debris. fine woody debris. herbs. mineral soil. organic soil (LFH layers). shrubs. and trees in each plot. Measures of wetness index. plant species richness. soil metal concentrations. soil pH. distance from smelter. and elevation were then used to assess factors affecting total ecosystem C storage. In lowland valleys where no active tree planting occurred (only natural regeneration) the treatments with lime. fertilizer. and grass and legume seed showed a 38% increase in C storage (101.1 ± 5.5 Mg C ha-1 (mean ± S.E.)) compared to untreated lowland plots (73.3 ± 5.9 Mg C ha1 ).

Velvet-blackness. a type of optical  effect is produced when light incident on a scale is scattered by microornamentation. I tested  microornamentation from Bitis arietans dorsal exuvia for these optical effects. Scales were  excised from shed skins of B. arietans and sputter coated with 15 nm Gold-Palladium to  control the effect of pigment. Spectral intensity (SI) of three scale regions of known micro topography was recorded using spectrophotometry over the visible spectrum only as a  measure of reflectivity of the scales. Given that surface roughness (the deviation of a  membrane’s surface topography from an ideal surface) is a product of the size of surface  asperities and its degree of randomness. the three scale regions in order of decreasing surface  roughness were dark (dorsal) scales. pale (dorsal) scales. and ventral scales. Measures of SI  on dorsal and ventral scale regions revealed lowest SI on dark dorsal scales and highest on  ventral scales. In general. the level of micro-structuring was inversely proportional to SI. To  test if optical effects are angle-dependent. I measured differences in SI between normal (90)  and oblique (45) angles of incidence. Differences in SI between 90 and 45 were significant  for all scale regions which revealed that while microornamentation produces optical effects at  both normal and oblique incidence. the effect is greater at 45.

Genome Ed. 2: 8. doi: 10.3389/fgeed,,,,In mammals over 65% of the total body iron is located within erythrocytes in the heme moieties of hemoglobin. Iron homeostasis requires iron absorbed from the diet by the gut as well as recycling of iron after the destruction of senescent erythrocytes. Senescent erythrocytes are engulfed by reticuloendothelial system macrophages where hemoglobin is broken down in the lysosomes. releasing heme for iron recovery in the cytoplasm. We recently showed that the SLC48A1 protein is responsible for transporting heme from the lysosome to the cytoplasm. CRISPR generated SLC48A1-deficient mice accumulate heme in their reticuloendothelial system macrophages as hemozoin crystals. Here we describe additional features of SLC48A1-deficient mice. We show that visible hemozoin first appears in the reticuloendothelial system macrophages of SLC48A1-deficient mice at 8 days of age. indicating the onset of erythrocyte recycling. Evaluation of normal and SLC48A1-deficient mice on iron-controlled diets show that SLC48A1-mediated iron recycling is equivalent to at least 10 parts per million of dietary iron. We propose that mutations in human SLC48A1 could contribute to idiopathic iron disorders.,True,Yp4YIEoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97ed/8bf802c6c4864045bb99bcfa60cdbf1dab30.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97ed/8bf802c6c4864045bb99bcfa60cdbf1dab30.pdf,0,0,0

This animals are very interesting due to their hypermetabolic development and also. their deffence based on toxic substances located in the hemolymph. One of the most known species is Berberomeloe majalis (Linnaeus. 1758). vernacularly known. in most cases. as “curita” or “carraleja” in the Cádiz Province.According to previous studies developed in this region. B. majalis seems to be distributed in a striking way. Although this species is not rare to be found in fields. it has an unequal distribution within its potential ecological niche. This could be because of to the lack of knowledge of its biology. as well as the various impacts that the species might be suffering due to human activities. Therefore. this study is approached from a biological and environmental point of view to provide information. to enhace existing knowledge. Therefore this study allows a better understanding of the Cadiz natural heritage. as well as to provide information that can contribute to the design of better conservation strategies.,True,z-zhhDwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,http://institutoecg.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Almoraima49-47-54.pdf,,,,http://institutoecg.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Almoraima49-47-54.pdf,0,0,0

1091880,Various Stages of Immune Synapse Formation Are Differently Dependent on the Strength of the TCR Stimulus,2020,Michael Estl and Pascal Blatt and Xuemei Li and Ute Becherer and Hsin-Fang Chang and Jens Rettig and Varsha Pattu,21,International journal of molecular sciences,7,2475,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are key players of the adaptive immune system that target tumors and infected cells. A central step to that is the formation of a cell–cell contact zone between the CTL and its target called an immune synapse (IS). Here. we investigate the influence of the initial T cell receptor (TCR) trigger of a cytolytic IS on the distinct steps leading to cytotoxic granule (CG) exocytosis. We stimulated primary CTLs from mouse using lipid bilayers with varying anti-CD3 but constant ICAM concentrations. We fluorescently labeled molecular markers of distinct IS zones such as actin. CD3. granzyme B. and Synaptobrevin2 in CTLs and imaged cytolytic IS formation by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). We found that an intermediate anti-CD3 concentration of 10 µg/mL induces the fastest adhesion of CTLs to the bilayers and results in maximal CG fusion efficiency. The latency of actin ring formation. dwell time. and maximum surface area at the IS exhibit different dependencies on the stimulatory anti-CD3 concentrations. The number and surface area of CD3 clusters at the IS seem to show a different dependency to the TCR trigger when compared to their dwell time. Finally. the mode of full CG exocytosis appears to be independent of the TCR trigger.

Although the pore structure is still unresolved. the mechanism through which cyclophilin D (CypD) regulates mPTP opening is the subject of intensive studies. While post-translational modifications of CypD have been shown to modulate pore opening. specific phosphorylation sites of CypD have not yet been identified. We hypothesized here that phosphorylation of CypD on a serine residue controls mPTP opening and subsequent cell death at reperfusion. We combined in silico analysis with in vitro and genetic manipulations to determine potential CypD phosphorylation sites and their effect on mitochondrial function and cell death.

1091925,USING THE DYNAMICS OF THE LOGISTIC MAP AS TOOL FOR RAPID ECOSYSTEM ASSESSMENT,2017,Roberto N Padua and Vincent T Lapinig and Rodrin R Rivera and Johnny Mark M Bolante,2,Journal of Higher Education Research Disciplines,1,,,This paper uses the logistic map as a primary tool for Rapid Ecosystem Assessment (REA). The behavior of the iterates of the logistic map depends on the growth parameter 𝜃 which conveys information about how well the ecosystem supports the growth of the organism. The ratio t= ɵ/4 expressed in percentage. indicates the proportion of the environment which is still in good condition. An estimator for based on available data is given as 4y. where y is the largest observed value. The properties of the estimator 𝜃 are derived and discussed. Data on the fisheries volume of production by Region and by Province were obtained from the Fisheries Statistics of the Philippines (Philippine Statistics Authority. Vol. 12-24. 2016) from 2001 to 2015 on which the growth parameters were estimated. Results indicate that in the Caraga region. 96% of the marine environment remains good and capable of sustaining fisheries. On the other hand. Region IV-A has only 70% of its fishing grounds staying in excellent condition while the remaining 30% of the fishing ground is no longer able to sustain fisheries production. The effects of industrialization and overfishing in Region IV-A (Calabarzon Special Economic Zone) were identified as possible causes of the gradual decline of the excellent fishing grounds in this region. More rigorous Marine Environment Assessment to pinpoint the 30% degraded area and the establishment of Marine Protected Areas to resuscitate these fishing grounds are suggested as interventions.,True,fmOQWV8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1,http://www.nmsc.edu.ph/ojs/index.php/jherd/article/view/88,13621381959914764844,/scholar?cites=13621381959914764844,,http://www.nmsc.edu.ph/ojs/index.php/jherd/article/download/88/39,0,0,0

The study utilized the descriptive design of research. Data of carbon dioxide emissions were gathered from Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis and data of livestock and crop production were gathered from Food and Agricultural Organization from 1960 to 2013. The data analysis is based on a simplified assumption that the accumulated CO 2 in the atmosphere includes agricultural crop production and livestock production as sources. In order to treat the data. symbolic regression was used. Symbolic regression is a type of regression analysis that does not specify the functional form of relationships between two variables. It utilizes genetic algorithm to execute the analysis. Ā The study provides further evidence of the claim that plants actually produce more carbon dioxide than was previously held. The study also strengthens the hypothesis that with global warming and with countries in tropical climates like the Philippines. CO 2 emissions from plants can be more than 11 times higher than traditional knowledge held.,True,fmOQWV8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,http://www.nmsc.edu.ph/ojs/index.php/jherd/article/view/100,,,,http://www.nmsc.edu.ph/ojs/index.php/jherd/article/download/100/61,0,0,0

Most often. pollen dispersal is measured using paternity assignment. However. this approach can be time‐consuming because it typically entails genotyping all pollen donors. receptors. and offspring at several molecular markers.We developed a faster. simpler protocol to track paternity. using pollen receptors and grouped pollen donors that possess rare alleles.

1091932,The Development and Use of Unique Molecular Markers to Study Pollen Dispersal Within Two Plant Species across Diverse Habitats in the New York Metropolitan Area,2018,Chelsea Lynne Butcher,,,,,,Pollen dispersal is the most important component of gene flow in plants. However. few studies have investigated pollen dispersal patterns among dissimilar sites and no studies have compared methods for modeling these patterns. Additionally. assessing pollen dispersal is complicated because of the time and monetary cost of current methods for tracking individual pollen and the use of contrasting methods for modeling empirical dispersal data. To address these issues. I investigated pollen dispersal in a wind-pollinated (Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.) JD Sauer) and an insect-pollinated species (Solanum lycopersicum L.) at four sites in the New York metropolitan area. I identified and optimized three molecular markers for A. tuberculatus and two for S. lycopersicum. Using these markers. 100% of the genotyped A. tuberculatus seeds were assigned to the experimental pollen donors and 97% of the genotyped S. lycopersicum fruits were assigned to the experimental pollen donors. while the remaining 3% were assigned to an unknown local pollen donor. Using these assignments. I then determined pollen dispersal distance and degree of dispersal in A. tuberculatus and S. lycopersicum in the four experimental populations. and used these data to model pollen dispersal patterns. For both species. and across sites. pollen dispersal decreased with increasing distance to the pollen donor. but the degree of dispersal and slope differed among sites in A. tuberculatus and S. lycopersicum. respectively. The relationship between pollen dispersal and distance was best fit by the exponential decay and inverse power curves. while pollen dispersal …,True,iPdaLa0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://research.library.fordham.edu/dissertations/AAI10812569/,,,,,0,0,0

Co-expression networks allow discovery of groups of genes whose mRNA levels are highly correlated. Subsequent annotation of those modules often reveals biological functions and specificity to the cell types implicated in the tissue being studied.  There are multiple approaches to perform such analyses with WGCNA amongst one of the most widely used R packages. While investigating a few network models can be done manually. it is often more advantageous to study a wider set of network models derived from the ever increasing quantities of transcriptomic data being generated (e.g. multiple networks built from many transcriptomic sources). However. there is no software tool available to make such a task easy. Furthermore. the visual nature of co-expression networks in combination with the coding skills that exploring networks requires. makes the construction of a web-based platform for their management highly desirable. Here. we present CoExp Web page. a user-friendly online tool that allows the exploitation of the full collection of 109 co-expression networks provided by the CoExpNets R package.,True,bH_8xSMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.176057v1.abstract,3064087739912274996,/scholar?cites=3064087739912274996,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/29/2020.06.29.176057.full.pdf,0,0,0
1091982,Modeling multifunctionality of genes with secondary gene co-expression networks in human brain provides novel disease insights,2020,Juan A Sánchez and Ana L Gil-Martinez and Alejandro Cisterna and Sonia García-Ruíz and Alicia Gómez and Regina H Reynolds and Mike A Nalls and John Hardy and Mina Ryten and Juan A Botía,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Co-expression networks are a powerful gene expression analysis method to study how genes co-express together in clusters with functional coherence that usually resemble specific cell type behaviour for the genes involved. They can be applied to bulk-tissue gene expression profiling and assign function. and usually cell type specificity. to a high percentage of the gene pool used to construct the network. One of the limitations of this method is that each gene is predicted to play a role in a specific set of coherent functions in a single cell type (i.e. at most we get a single <gene. function. cell type> for each gene). We present here GMSCA (Gene Multifunctionality Secondary Co-expression Analysis). a software tool that exploits the co-expression paradigm to increase the number of functions and cell types ascribed to  a gene in bulk-tissue co-expression networks. We applied GMSCA to 27 co-expression networks derived from bulk-tissue gene expression profiling of a variety of brain tissues. Neurons and glial cells (microglia. astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) were considered the main cell types. Applying this approach. we increase the overall number of predicted triplets <gene. function. cell type> by 46.73%. Moreover. GMSCA predicts that the SNCA gene. traditionally associated to work mainly in neurons. also plays a relevant function in oligodendrocytes.

As onion root tips are used for radiation cytogenetic studies for assessment of chromosomal damage to plant cells. here in this study we have used Allium cepa root meristem cells. A karyotype denotes a full set of chromosomes from an individual species which is generally compared to a normal karyotype of the same species for confirmation of the detected chromosomal anomaly which occurs usually when there is an error in cell division following meiosis or mitosis. The karyotype analysis (2n= 16) of root tip cells of onion showed normal mitotic metaphase. anaphase. telophase chromosomes in contrast to those onion root tips which after pretreatment were exposed to UV radiation of 254 nm for a duration of 5 and 10 minutes.

To deal with the growing threat of MDR strains. we need to reduce the worldwide misuse of antibiotics both in human and in veterinary medicine. In addition. we have to speed up the pipeline for developing new antibiotics. To achieve that. we may need to use novel mechanisms of drug action. drug delivery. and employ novel antibacterial drug targets. In the present review. we have discussed the mode of actions of antibacterial drugs and the process by which resistance is developed and propagated.

An inventory of Norwegian species of Pteromalus (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) associated with Asteraceae plants.,2016,Jon Peder Hjertenes Lindemann,,,,,,Frequently. DNA studies on parasitic Hymenoptera have revealed host specific cryptic species from complexes previously thought of as single generalist species. The parasitic Hymenoptera genus. Pteromalus. involves members that attack fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) with variable degrees of host specificities. but with one species. P. albipennis. particularly standing out as a generalist. Many members of the genus are also very close morphologically. and the status of some of the species has therefore earlier been questioned. These trends indicate a potential presence of cryptic species. or the opposite. that several nominal species exist within the boundaries of a single species. To test these assumptions. species of Pteromalus were investigated based on morphological determinations. sequence data and their host fruit fly relations. The insects were hatched from different Asteraceae plants. and sequence analyses of the Pteromalus specimens were conducted based on two loci. the mitochondrial COI and nuclear ITS2 regions. Despite large intraspecific genetic variation in the two loci. no clear indication on cryptic species was revealed. This indicates that the observed polymorphism is caused by other factors. such as population size. speciation in reverse. Introgressive hybridization or Wolbachia infection. In two cases. sequence analyses were not able to distinguish between species of Pteromalus. suggesting that what is currently recognized as seven valid species rather exists within the boundaries of two.

We examined the impact of five different hydromechanical medium properties (hydroponics. vermiculite. vermiculite-gravel. sawdust. and sand) on the morphology. physiology. and anatomy of Cedrus atlantica seedlings at a controlled growth chamber. The growth of the seedling is strongly stimulated by the hydroponic medium through the stimulation of the aerial part dry weight and the main root length. However. the sand medium increases the main root dry weight by the radial expanse stimulation at the level of the epidermis. vascular cylinder. and cortex and compensates the less root architecture by the stimulation of the xylem and phloem areas. In contrast to sand and hydroponic media. the sawdust medium stimulates the phloem/xylem ratio. the root architecture. and the short roots. The Pearson bilateral correlation shows that the aerial part dry weight is positively correlated with the permeability. porosity. and water-holding capacity and negatively with the bulk density and density at saturation. whereas the short root production is negatively correlated with the permeability and water-holding capacity.

Stochastic (geostatistical) seismic inversion. as a complementary method to deterministic inversion. is perceived as contribution combination of geostatistics and seismic inversion algorithm. This method integrates information from different data sources with different scales. as prior information in Bayesian statistics. Data integration leads to a probability density function (named as a posteriori probability) that can yield a model of subsurface. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to sample the posterior probability distribution. and the subsurface model characteristics can be extracted by analyzing a set of the samples. In this study. the theory of stochastic seismic inversion in a Bayesian framework was described and applied to infer P-impedance and porosity models.

Magnetic and gravity surveys are usually based on potential field methods. In potential field data processing the edge enhancement is an important issue. Edge enhancement of potential field data has been widely used as a tool in mineral exploration prospects. Vertical derivatives of potential field data are in current approach to enhance observed probable anomalies. A well-known method of enhancing boundaries of underground structures corresponds to the zero contour of the second vertical derivative of gravity or reduced-to-the-pole of magnetic fields. However. as is well known. the estimated boundaries acquired by such technique are systematically shifted from the true position even for vertical-sided sources. and application of this method produces fairly …,True,DaLEOm4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://jesphys.ut.ac.ir/mobile/article_35608.html?lang=en,,,,https://jesphys.ut.ac.ir/mobile/article_35608.html?lang=en,0,0,0

University of Tehran,AVO theory was introduced around 20 years ago. In recent years. this technique was become to a major tool in hydrocarbon sources exploration. By the help of this method with the suitable understanding from underground layers and knowing how to use this technology. quantitative specifications of reservoir can be recognized. AVO analysis is a seismic technique that by using of pre-stack data. establish the presence of hydrocarbon in reservoir. Three basic physical parameters used in seismic interpretation are density. P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity. For applying AVO technique. having a correct understanding of this parameters is required. Introduction: Zoeppritz equations determine Reflection and Transmission Coefficients as a function of Incidence angle. but these equations don’t show how amplitude variations change with rock physical parameters truly. Zoeppritz equations approximations are simpler and more general respect to real equations. Some famous approximations for Zoeppritz equations are Aki. Richards & Fraiser (1980). Shuey and Fatti et al. approximations. With the help of these approximations some variable attributes can be extracted.  Ghar reservoir characterizations in Aboozar oil field: Aboozar oil field is located in North-West of Persian Gulf and is 75 KM far from east of Khark Island. This field was explored in recent 1950s and its production was started in 1976. The main hydrocarbon producer layer in this field is Ghar sand stone reservoir with Oligo-Miocene age.

This study aimed to determine the capability of anthocyanin in the red cabbage to convert light into electricity by fabricating anthocyanin-sensitized solar cells. Anthocyanin extracted from the crude extract of red cabbage underwent transmittance and absorbance analysis. using the UV-Vis Spectroscopy analysis to determine its light absorbing capability. Anthocyanin-sensitized solar cells are then fabricated with ZnO/Anthocyanin/Electrolyte configuration. A high absorption band in the wavelength range of 450-540 nm indicates the capability of anthocyanin to absorb light. The presence of electrolyte enhances the reactivity towards light as observed in the increase by the absorption of the samples.

Philippines,2014,SA Yap and R Laude and V San Juan and B Panabang and JR Adorada and KL Nicolas and VC Lapitan,,Philippine Entomologist (Philippines),,,,Nipa palm (Nypa fruticans Wurmb.) is considered as one of the most common. widely distributed and useful palms in the mangrove areas in Southeast Asia (Tsuji. 2011). Important products are derived from nipa. It is used for thatching house walls and roofs. a source of sugar and vinegar. and it is a useful source of biofuel. According to Hamilton and Murphy (1988). nipa can produce more ethanol than sugarcane. In addition. it provides protection as a buffer or intertidal protective zone against typhoons. storm surges and tidal waves to the coastal ecosystem and a unique habitat to aquatic flora and fauna. In spite of its economic and ecological importance. scientific studies related to Nipa palm in general are lacking. Reports on its arthropod pests as well as its pollinators are not well documented. Only Octodonta nipae (Maulik) has been reported attacking Nipa palm. a palm leaf beetle attacking leaf fronds of exotic palm species (Vassiliou. et. al. 2011). This is a pioneering study on the arthropods found in nipa in the country. The study assessed the diversity of arthropods with emphasis on the foliage-dwelling species in nipa areas. Abundance and species diversity of arthropods were assessed in different Nipa areas located in Southern Luzon (Infanta. Quezon; Calauag. Quezon; Vinzons. Camarines Norte. and Calabanga. Camarines Sur) island. Arthropods were sampled in a 2 km transect line across the nipa areas with sweep net. opportunistic sampling. and light trapping.

Â In this study we implemented the use of an Android mobile application into a faunal biodiversity database. The aim of the study is to determine the process framework. identify the requirements. design and build an application that would facilitate the reporting process of occurrences into the web database in-situ and real time. Using iZOO (http://biodiversity. fbb. utm. my/izoo/). a FRIM faunal database that hosts hundreds of primary faunal data in Malaysia. we designed and deployed a prototype mobile app called iZOO mobile. The application allows complete digitisation of present conventional method of writing on paper during the data collection process and immediate upload into database using data connectivity upon availability. This prevents mistakes caused by human error. data loss and data disorganization. The application were tested during several fieldtrips in Belum-Temenggor and Lenggor.

1092088,A MOBILE APPLICATION FOR SCIURIDAE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION,2014,B Parveen and MA Shahfiz and NA Amirah and M Kaviarasu and TH Chew and MS Shamsir,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE ON FORESTRY AND FOREST PRODUCTS RESEARCH 2013,,20,,Biodiversity must be treated seriously as natural and global resources need to be indexed. used and. above all. preserved and conserved. At this time. there are three circumstances that confer this matter an unprecedented urgency: first. human populations that are exploiting and degrading the environment at an accelerating rate. especially in the tropical countries; second. science that is to be discovered to bring about new uses and applications in ways that can relieve both human suffering and environmental destruction; and lastly. much of the diversity that is being irreversibly lost through extinction caused by destruction of natural habitats (Wilson 1988). Therefore. all fundamental information is required to know the presence of a species and its functions. as well as its geographical ranges. biological properties and possible vulnerability to environmental change. In order to gather this information. the first task is knowing the species. Unlikely. in most cases. researchers spend their money. time and effort to study the systematic key for certain species using classical nomenclatures.On top of that. in order to promote biodiversity conservation. the identification of species only involves specialist researchers. policy-makers and respective stakeholders. whereas the general public’s involvement is very minimal and only limited to common-minded enthusiasts (Buijs et al. 2008). The development of this application allows knowledge sharing not only between people of the biology research community but also with the general public. where it could create interest and awareness (Lindemann-Matthies & Bose 2008).

1092092,The influence of specific light spectrums on rooting of woody cuttings of coniferous species in nursery practice,,Marian Maier and Petr Salaš and Martin Jonáš and Hana Sasková and Maksat B Matraimov,,,,,,Light. as a vital source of energy. is one of the factors that significantly influence development of plants. In common nursery practice. coniferous species are propagated mostly vegetatively. with rooting of woody cuttings being one of the regularly used methods. Propagation with woody cuttings is usually performed outside vegetation. ie during periods with insufficient quantity and quality of daylight. Artificial lighting can significantly help to solve this problem. An experiment was carried out using daylight-compensating LED systems with specific wavelengths (460nm and 670nm for alternative A; 440nm and 630nm for alternative B). the intensity was 70 µmol s-1 m-2. Spectra were composed in 4: 1 ratio (“Red”:“Blue”) using modules with mounted LED diodes. The experiment was performed on Thuja occidentalis' Columna'. which was artificially lit for over 12 hours along with daylight. The experiment took place in two terms: from November to March. and from February to June. The results showed differences based on the term of cutting. as well as in the artificially-lit alternatives.,True,x67Id3oAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,0,http://www.cbks.cz/SbornikBrno14/Maier.pdf,,,,http://www.cbks.cz/SbornikBrno14/Maier.pdf,0,0,0

Na região noroeste do Estado de São Paulo. existe menos de 2% da vegetação nativa preservada (Veloso. 1991). A vegetação remanescente em sua maioria apresenta forte alteração promovida pelo corte seletivo e por queimadas ocasionais. Uma comunidade vegetal é o conjunto de espécies que ocorrem juntas num mesmo local. Densidade é o número de indivíduos de cada espécie presente na composição da comunidade e a dominância expressa a proporção de tamanho. de volume ou de cobertura de cada espécie. em relação ao espaço ou volume da comunidade. A densidade pode ser utilizada como um parâmetro para medir qualidade ambiental. já que ela pode resultar em maior produtividade e promover a heterogeneidade ambiental produzindo novos nichos. bem como servir de meio de transporte para animais que utilizam a copa em seus deslocamentos. A densidade é importante para o melhor funcionamento das relações de interações entre o ambiente e os organismos existentes no local. A fitossociologia estuda o agrupamento das plantas bem como sua inter-relação e dependência aos fatores bióticos em determinado ambiente. A vegetação varia com a composição florística. com a riqueza de espécies. produtividade e grau de predominância de cada espécie.

Aguas Zarcas.,2006,Christian Alberto Camacho-Retana,,,,,,En Finca La Fama. en Santa Fe. de Aguas Zarcas. Alajuela. se llevó acabo el estudio de comportamiento de cosecha de fruta piña (Ananas comosus) híbrido MD-2. bajo las condiciones de maduración comercial aplicadas. Se presenta un informe del comportamiento de la maduración de fruta. que permite conocer el momento de inicio de cosecha y el período necesario para finalizar la cosecha por lote forzado en una misma fecha. Durante la cosecha se visualizan tres períodos luego de la maduración inducida; 1. Etapa de “bordeo”. que corresponde desde el inicio de la cosecha hasta alcanzar el 5% del total de frutas. la cual se alcanza al final del quinto día. 2. Etapa de “avance de la cosecha” comprendida desde el día seis al día 16 después de la maduración inducida con un alcance del 90% de la producción. 3. Etapa de “barrido”; que corresponde desde el día 17 al 24 después de la maduración inducida y comprende el 5% de la cosecha total. El comportamiento de la cosecha de la fruta se asocia a las condiciones climáticas imperantes durante el período posterior a la aplicación del agente madurador; y actúan como factor principal determinante de la reacción de la fruta como respuesta a dicha labor. Al relacionar los resultados se puede predecir con mayor certeza el momento para ejecutar la labor de maduración y la cosecha; facilita la estimación del volumen de fruta para el mercado. lo que permite ofrecer con mayor acierto el volumen de fruta a los clientes en los mercados internacionales.

Such as Escherichia coli. Staphylococcus aureus. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Qualitative detection of the active compounds of the plant extracts was done with chemical reagents. Also. the Qualitative detection of the active groups was further verified with (FTIR). The sensitivity of the UTI causing bacteria was examined against 12 different antibiotics. The results show that E. coli was the most resistant bacteria. resisting 8 from 12 antibiotics; P. aeruginosa resisted 5 from 12 antibiotics; while S. aureus showed resistance to 4 only. The antibacterial activity of the plant extracts was investigated by using four concentrations (40. 60. 80. 100 mg/ml) for each extract against two types of Gram negative bacteria (E. coli. P. aeruginosa). and one type of Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus). The plant extracts showed different effects on the growth of all bacterial strains. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the ethanolic extracts and aqueous extracts in the study were determined. The kill-time was determined also for each extract. The antioxidant activity of the plants in the study was investigated. Finally. the toxicity of the plant extracts was examined on human red blood cells.,True,Hp68dzEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,http://mjs.uomustansiriyah.edu.iq/ojs1/index.php/MJS/article/view/177,,,,http://mjs.uomustansiriyah.edu.iq/ojs1/index.php/MJS/article/download/177/132,0,0,0
