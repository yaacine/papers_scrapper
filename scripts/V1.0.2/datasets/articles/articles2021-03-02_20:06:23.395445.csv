Here we report an analysis of the genome sequence of P. falciparum clone 3D7. The 23-megabase nuclear genome consists of 14 chromosomes. encodes about 5.300 genes. and is the most (A+ T)-rich genome sequenced to date. Genes involved in antigenic variation are concentrated in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes. Compared to the genomes of free-living eukaryotic microbes. the genome of this intracellular parasite encodes fewer enzymes and transporters. but a large proportion of genes are devoted to immune evasion and host–parasite interactions. Many nuclear-encoded proteins are targeted to the apicoplast. an organelle involved in fatty-acid and isoprenoid metabolism.

Amongst the human-infective species. Schistosoma mansoni is also the most commonly used in the laboratory and here we present the systematic improvement of its draft genome. We used Sanger capillary and deep-coverage Illumina sequencing from clonal worms to upgrade the highly fragmented draft 380 Mb genome to one with only 885 scaffolds and more than 81% of the bases organised into chromosomes. We have also used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) from four time points in the parasite's life cycle to refine gene predictions and profile their expression. More than 45% of predicted genes have been extensively modified and the total number has been reduced from 11.807 to 10.852. Using the new version of the genome. we identified trans-splicing events occurring in at least 11% of genes and identified clear cases where it is used to resolve polycistronic transcripts. We have produced a high-resolution map of temporal changes in expression for 9.535 genes. covering an unprecedented dynamic range for this organism. All of these data have been consolidated into a searchable format within the GeneDB (www.genedb.org) and SchistoDB (www.schistodb.net) databases.

Whether microRNAs are involved in regulating developmental programs of parasitic nematodes is currently unknown. Here we describe the the miRNA repertoire of two important parasitic nematodes as an essential first step in addressing this question. The small RNAs from larval and adult stages of two parasitic species. Brugia pahangi and Haemonchus contortus. were identified using deep-sequencing and bioinformatic approaches.

Initial analysis of a new genome usually includes annotation and comparative genomics. Synteny provides a framework in which conservation of homologous genes and gene order is identified between genomes of different species. The availability of human and mouse genomes paved the way for algorithm development in large-scale synteny mapping. which eventually became an integral part of comparative genomics. Synteny analysis is regularly performed on assembled sequences that are fragmented. neglecting the fact that most methods were developed using complete genomes. It is unknown to what extent draft assemblies lead to errors in such analysis. We fragmented genome assemblies of model nematodes to various extents and conducted synteny identification and downstream analysis. We first show that synteny between species can be underestimated up to 40% and find disagreements between popular tools that infer synteny blocks. This inconsistency and further demonstration of erroneous gene ontology enrichment tests raise questions about the robustness of previous synteny analysis when gold standard genome sequences remain limited. In addition. assembly scaffolding using a reference guided approach with a closely related species may result in chimeric scaffolds with inflated assembly metrics if a true evolutionary relationship was overlooked. Annotation quality. however. has minimal effect on synteny if the assembled genome is highly contiguous.

Haemonchus contortus is an economically significant parasite of livestock that is widely used for basic research as well as for vaccine development and drug discovery. It is one of many medically and economically important parasites within the strongylid nematode group. This group of parasites has the closest phylogenetic relationship with the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. making comparative analysis a potentially powerful tool for genome annotation and functional studies. To investigate this hypothesis. we sequenced two contiguous fragments from the H. contortus genome and undertook detailed annotation and comparative analysis with C. elegans. The adult H. contortus transcriptome was sequenced using an Illumina platform and RNA-seq was used to annotate a 409 kb overlapping BAC tiling path relating to the X chromosome and a 181 kb BAC insert relating to chromosome I. In total. 40 genes and 12 putative transposable elements were identified. 97.5% of the annotated genes had detectable homologues in C. elegans of which 60% had putative orthologues. significantly higher than previous analyses based on EST analysis. Gene density appears to be less in H. contortus than in C. elegans. with annotated H. contortus genes being an average of two-to-three times larger than their putative C. elegans orthologues due to a greater intron number and size.

Schistosoma mansoni is the most experimentally tractable schistosome species due to its ease of propagation in the laboratory and the high quality of its genome assembly and annotation. Although there is growing interest in microRNAs (miRNAs) in trematodes. little is known about the role these molecules play in the context of developmental processes. We use the completely unaware “miRNA-blind” bioinformatics tool Sylamer to analyse the 3’-UTRs of transcripts differentially expressed between the juvenile and adult stages. We show that the miR-277/4989 family target sequence is the only one significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. Further. we describe a novel miRNA. sma-miR-4989 showing that its proximal genomic location to sma-miR-277 suggests that they form a miRNA cluster. and we propose hairpin folds for both miRNAs compatible with the miRNA pathway. In addition. we found that expression of sma-miR-277/4989 miRNAs are up-regulated in adults while their predicted targets are characterised by significant down-regulation in paired adult worms but remain largely undisturbed in immature “virgin” females. Finally. we show that sma-miR-4989 is expressed in tegumental cells located proximal to the oesophagus gland and also distributed throughout the male worms’ body.

The ability to parasitize plants has originated independently at least three times during nematode evolution and. as more molecular data has emerged. it has become clear that multiple instances of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria and fungi have played a crucial role in the nematode's adaptation to this new lifestyle.

In this article. we report the presence of a putative endoxylanase in the migratory endoparasitic nematode Radopholus similis. This enzyme is thought to facilitate the migration of the nematode. as it breaks down xylan. the major component of hemicellulose. The corresponding gene (Rs‐xyl1) was cloned and the sequence revealed three small introns.

This biotrophic parasite secretes effectors from pharyngeal glands. some of which were acquired by horizontal gene transfer. to manipulate host processes and promote parasitism. G. rostochiensis is classified into pathotypes with different plant resistance-breaking phenotypes. We generate a high quality genome assembly for G. rostochiensis pathotype Ro1. identify putative effectors and horizontal gene transfer events. map gene expression through the life cycle focusing on key parasitic transitions and sequence the genomes of eight populations including four additional pathotypes to identify variation. Horizontal gene transfer contributes 3.5 % of the predicted genes. of which approximately 8.5 % are deployed as effectors. Over one-third of all effector genes are clustered in 21 putative ‘effector islands’ in the genome. We identify a dorsal gland promoter element motif (termed DOG Box) present upstream in representatives from 26 out of 28 dorsal gland effector families. and predict a putative effector superset associated with this motif. We validate gland cell expression in two novel genes by in situ hybridisation and catalogue dorsal gland promoter element-containing effectors from available cyst nematode genomes.

While feeding and probing these insects deliver molecules. called effectors. inside their host to enable infestation. The identification and characterization of these effectors from different species that vary in their host range is an important step in understanding the infestation success of aphids and aphid host range variation. This study employs a multi-disciplinary approach based on transcriptome sequencing and proteomics to identify and compare effector candidates from the broad host range aphid Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) (genotypes O. J and F). and narrow host range aphids Myzus cerasi (black cherry aphid) and Rhopalosiphum padi (bird-cherry oat aphid). Using a combination of aphid transcriptome sequencing on libraries derived from head versus body tissues as well as saliva proteomics we were able to predict candidate effectors repertoires from the different aphid species and genotypes. Among the identified conserved or core effector sets. we identified a significant number of previously identified aphid candidate effectors indicating these proteins may be involved in general infestation strategies. Moreover. we identified aphid candidate effector sequences that were specific to one species. which are interesting candidates for further validation and characterization with regards to species-specific functions during infestation.

Array analyses identified a total of 648 genes differentially regulated by RcsCB in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with our previous findings. RcsB acts as a positive regulator in both conditions. while RcsC positively controls expression of amylovoran biosynthetic genes in vivo but …,True,PW7FtYEAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC,50,https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI-08-11-0207,3353884513831544370,/scholar?cites=3353884513831544370,,https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/MPMI-08-11-0207,0,0,0

The phage named SpaA1 is morphologically similar to phages of the family Siphoviridae. The 42.784 bp genome of SpaA1 is a linear. double-stranded DNA molecule with 3′ protruding cohesive ends. The SpaA1 genome encompasses 63 predicted protein-coding genes which cluster within three regions of the genome. each of apparently different origin. in a mosaic pattern. In two of these regions. the gene sets resemble those in prophages of Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki str. T03a001 (genes involved in DNA replication/transcription. cell entry and exit) and B. cereus AH676 (additional regulatory and recombination genes). respectively. The third region represents an almost complete genome (except for the short terminal segments) of a distinct bacteriophage. MZTP02. Nearly the same gene module was identified in prophages of B. thuringiensis serovar monterrey BGSC 4AJ1 and B. cereus Rock4-2. These findings suggest that MZTP02 can be shuttled between genomes of other bacteriophages and prophages. leading to the formation of chimeric genomes. The presence of a complete phage genome in the genome of other phages apparently has not been described previously and might represent a ‘fast track’ route of virus evolution and horizontal gene transfer. Another phage (BceA1) nearly identical in sequence to SpaA1. and also including the almost complete MZTP02 genome within its own genome. was isolated from a bacterium of the B. cereus/B. thuringiensis group.

We present a 10X draft sequence of P. anserina genome. linked to the sequences of a large expressed sequence tag collection. Similar to higher eukaryotes. the P. anserina transcription/splicing machinery generates numerous non-conventional transcripts. Comparison of the P. anserina genome and orthologous gene set with the one of its close relatives. Neurospora crassa. shows that synteny is poorly conserved. the main result of evolution being gene shuffling in the same chromosome. The P. anserina genome contains fewer repeated sequences and has evolved new genes by duplication since its separation from N. crassa. despite the presence of the repeat induced point mutation mechanism that mutates duplicated sequences. We also provide evidence that frequent gene loss took place in the lineages leading to P. anserina and N. crassa. P. anserina contains a large and highly specialized set of genes involved in utilization of natural carbon sources commonly found in its natural biotope. It includes genes potentially involved in lignin degradation and efficient cellulose breakdown.

The multiplication of microsatellites might also be linked to mobile elements. Furthermore. crossing over between nonhomologous microsatellites can lead to the exchange of the flanking regions between microsatellites.

To disentangle this surprising parasitic success despite the absence of sex and genetic exchanges. we have sequenced and assembled the genomes of three obligatory ameiotic and asexual Meloidogyne.

Chemical nematicides have so far constituted the most efficient control measures against these agricultural pests. Because of their toxicity for the environment and danger for human health. these nematicides have now been banned from use. Consequently. new and more specific control means. safe for the environment and human health. are urgently needed to avoid worldwide proliferation of these devastating plant-parasites. Mining the genomes of root-knot nematodes through an evolutionary and comparative genomics approach. we identified and analyzed 15.952 nematode genes conserved in genomes of plant-damaging species but absent from non target genomes of chordates. plants. annelids. insect pollinators and mollusks. Functional annotation of the corresponding proteins revealed a relative abundance of putative transcription factors in this parasite-specific set compared to whole proteomes of root-knot nematodes. This may point to important and specific regulators of genes involved in parasitism. Because these nematodes are known to secrete effector proteins in planta. essential for parasitism. we searched and identified 993 such effector-like proteins absent from non-target species. Aiming at identifying novel targets for the development of future control methods. we biologically tested the effect of inactivation of the corresponding genes through RNA interference.

As well as being an important pathogen. the B. xylophilus genome thus provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution and mechanism of plant parasitism. Here. we present a high-quality draft genome sequence from an inbred line of B. xylophilus. and use this to investigate the biological basis of its complex ecology which combines fungal feeding. plant parasitic and insect-associated stages.

Its epidemiology depends heavily on horizontal transmission. especially between rodents and its definitive host. the cat. Neospora caninum is a recently discovered close relative of Toxoplasma. whose definitive host is the dog. Both species are tissue-dwelling Coccidia and members of the phylum Apicomplexa; they share many common features. but Neospora neither infects humans nor shares the same wide host range as Toxoplasma. rather it shows a striking preference for highly efficient vertical transmission in cattle.

The recent experimental demonstration of a sexual cycle in Leishmania within sand flies has confirmed the occurrence of hybridisation. but knowledge of the parasite life cycle in the wild still remains limited. Here. we use whole genome sequencing to investigate the frequency of sexual reproduction in Leishmania. by sequencing the genomes of 11 Leishmania infantum isolates from sand flies and 1 patient isolate in a focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Çukurova province of southeast Turkey. This is the first genome-wide examination of a vector-isolated population of Leishmania parasites. A genome-wide pattern of patchy heterozygosity and SNP density was observed both within individual strains and across the whole group. Comparisons with other Leishmania donovani complex genome sequences suggest that these isolates are derived from a single cross of two diverse strains with subsequent recombination within the population. This interpretation is supported by a statistical model of the genomic variability for each strain compared to the L. infantum reference genome strain as well as genome-wide scans for recombination within the population. Further analysis of these heterozygous blocks indicates that the two parents were phylogenetically distinct.

A recent epidemic in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) caused up to 80% of global VL and over 30.000 deaths per year. Resistance against antimonial drugs has probably been a contributing factor in the persistence of this epidemic. Here we use whole genome sequences from 204 clinical isolates to track the evolution and epidemiology of L. donovani from the ISC. We identify independent radiations that have emerged since a bottleneck coincident with 1960s DDT spraying campaigns. A genetically distinct population frequently resistant to antimonials has a two base-pair insertion in the aquaglyceroporin gene LdAQP1 that prevents the transport of trivalent antimonials. We find evidence of genetic exchange between ISC populations. and show that the mutation in LdAQP1 has spread by recombination.

Since its advent. the scale and efficiency of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has rapidly improved. In spite of this success. sequencing genomes or genomic regions with extremely biased base composition is still a great challenge to the currently available NGS platforms. The genomes of some important pathogenic organisms like Plasmodium falciparum (high AT content) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (high GC content) display extremes of base composition. The standard library preparation procedures that employ PCR amplification have been shown to cause uneven read coverage particularly across AT and GC rich regions. leading to problems in genome assembly and variation analyses. Alternative library-preparation approaches that omit PCR amplification require large quantities of starting material and hence are not suitable for small amounts of DNA/RNA such as those from clinical isolates.

They encode hypervariable surface proteins known as P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) that are critical for pathogenesis and immune evasion in Plasmodium falciparum. How var gene sequence diversity is generated is not currently completely understood. To address this. we constructed large clone trees and performed whole genome sequence analysis to study the generation of novel var gene sequences in asexually replicating parasites. While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were scattered across the genome. structural variants (deletions. duplications. translocations) were focused in and around var genes. with considerable variation in frequency between strains. Analysis of more than 100 recombination events involving var exon 1 revealed that the average nucleotide sequence identity of two recombining exons was only 63% (range: 52.7–72.4%) yet the crossovers were error-free and occurred in such a way that the resulting sequence was in frame and domain architecture was preserved. Var exon 1. which encodes the immunologically exposed part of the protein. recombined in up to 0.2% of infected erythrocytes in vitro per life cycle. The high rate of var exon 1 recombination indicates that millions of new antigenic structures could potentially be generated each day in a single infected individual.

We reconstruct VSG diversification showing that Trypanosoma congolense uses variant antigens derived from multiple ancestral VSG lineages. whereas in Trypanosoma brucei VSG have recent origins. and ancestral gene lineages have been repeatedly co …,True,DGuMoGIAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,142,https://www.pnas.org/content/109/9/3416.short,13252700340545901542,/scholar?cites=13252700340545901542,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/109/9/3416.full.pdf,0,0,0

Both species are tissue-dwelling Coccidia and members of the phylum Apicomplexa; they share many common features. but Neospora neither infects humans nor shares the same wide host range as Toxoplasma. rather it shows a striking preference for highly efficient vertical transmission in cattle.

Although most superfamilies are structurally conserved. in some of the most highly populated superfamilies (4% of all superfamilies) there is considerable structural divergence. While relatives share a similar fold in the evolutionary conserved core. diverse elaborations to this core can result in significant differences in the global structures. Applying similar protocols to examine the extent to which structural overlaps occur between different fold groups. it appears this effect is confined to just a few architectures and is largely due to small. recurring super-secondary motifs (e.g.. αβ-motifs. α-hairpins). Although 24% of superfamilies overlap with superfamilies having different folds. only 14% of nonredundant structures in CATH are involved in overlaps.

As structural classifications traditionally act as the gold standard of homology this poses a challenge in benchmarking them.

ATCC 39006 (S39006) is a Gram-negative enterobacterium that is virulent in plant and animal models. It produces a red-pigmented trypyrrole secondary metabolite. prodigiosin (Pig). and a carbapenem antibiotic (Car). as well as the exoenzymes. pectate lyase and cellulase. Secondary metabolite production in this strain is controlled by a complex regulatory network involving quorum sensing (QS). Hfq and RsmA (two RNA binding proteins and major post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression) play opposing roles in the regulation of several key phenotypes within S39006. Prodigiosin and carbapenem production was abolished. and virulence attenuated. in an S39006 ∆hfq mutant. while the converse was observed in an S39006 rsmA transposon insertion mutant.

Traditionally. new knowledge on protein associations generated by experiments has played a central role in systems modelling. in contrast to generally less trusted bio-computational predictions. However. we will not achieve realistic modelling of complex molecular systems if the current experimental designs lead to biased screenings of real protein networks and leave large. functionally important areas poorly characterised. To assess the likelihood of this. we have built comprehensive network models of the yeast and human proteomes by using a meta-statistical integration of diverse computationally predicted protein association datasets. We have compared these predicted networks against combined experimental datasets from seven biological resources at different level of statistical significance. These eukaryotic predicted networks resemble all the topological and noise features of the experimentally inferred networks in both species. and we also show that this observation is not due to random behaviour. In addition. the topology of the predicted networks contains information on true protein associations. beyond the constitutive first order binary predictions. We also observe that most of the reliable predicted protein associations are experimentally uncharacterised in our models. constituting the hidden or “dark matter” of networks by analogy to astronomical systems.

Host range studies have shown that nearly 400 plant species can be parasitized by this species. To obtain insight into the transcriptome of this migratory plant-parasitic nematode. we used Illumina mRNA sequencing analysis of a mixed population. as well as nematode reads detected in infected soybean roots 3 and 7 days after nematode infection. Over 140 million paired end reads were obtained for this species. and de novo assembly resulted in a total of 23.715 transcripts. Homology searches showed significant hit matches to 58% of the total number of transcripts using different protein and EST databases. In general. the transcriptome of P. penetrans follows common features reported for other root lesion nematode species. We also explored the efficacy of RNAi. delivered from the host. as a strategy to control P. penetrans. by targeted knock-down of selected nematode genes. Different comparisons were performed to identify putative nematode genes with a role in parasitism. resulting in the identification of transcripts with similarities to other nematode parasitism genes. Focusing on the predicted nematode secreted proteins found in this transcriptome. we observed specific members to be up-regulated at the early time points of infection.

Plant parasitism has arisen four times independently within the phylum Nematoda. resulting in at least one parasite of every major food crop in the world. Some species within the most economically important order (Tylenchida) secrete proteins termed effectors into their host during infection to re-programme host development and immunity. The precise detail of how nematodes evolve new effectors is not clear. Here we reconstruct the evolutionary history of a novel effector gene family. We show that during the evolution of plant parasitism in the Tylenchida. the housekeeping glutathione synthetase (GS) gene was extensively replicated. New GS paralogues acquired multiple dorsal gland promoter elements. altered spatial expression to the secretory dorsal gland. altered temporal expression to primarily parasitic stages. and gained a signal peptide for secretion. The gene products are delivered into the host plant cell during infection. giving rise to “GS-like effectors”. Remarkably. by solving the structure of GS-like effectors we show that during this process they have also diversified in biochemical activity. and likely represent the founding members of a novel class of GS-like enzyme. Our results demonstrate the re-purposing of an endogenous housekeeping gene to form a family of effectors with modified functions.

Sedentary endoparasitic nematodes are obligate biotrophs and modify host root tissue. using a suite of effector proteins. to create a feeding site that is their sole source of nutrition. They feed by withdrawing host cell assimilate from the feeding site though a structure known as the feeding tube. The function. composition and molecular characteristics of feeding tubes are poorly characterised. It is hypothesised that the feeding tube facilitates uptake of host cell assimilate by acting as a molecular sieve. Several studies. using molecular mass as the sole indicator of protein size. have given contradictory results about the exclusion limits of the cyst nematode feeding tube. In this study we propose a method to predict protein size. based on protein database coordinates in silico. We tested the validity of these predictions using travelling wave ion mobility spectrometry – mass spectrometry. where predictions and measured values were within approximately 6%. We used the predictions. coupled with mass spectrometry. analytical ultracentrifugation and protein electrophoresis. to resolve previous conflicts and define the exclusion characteristics of the cyst nematode feeding tube.

The migratory endoparasitic nematode. Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. (pinewood nematode) is a quarantine pathogen that infects pine trees and has a hugely detrimental economic impact on the forestry industry. Under certain environmental conditions large areas of infected trees can be destroyed. leading to damage on an ecological scale. The interactions of B. xylophilus with plants are mediated by secreted effector proteins produced in the pharyngeal gland cells. Identification of effectors is important to understand mechanisms of parasitism and to develop new control measures for the pathogens. Using an approach pioneered in cyst nematodes. we have analysed the promoter regions of a small panel of previously validated pharyngeal gland cell effectors from B. xylophilus to identify an associated putative regulatory promoter motif: STATAWAARS. The presence of STATAWAARS in the promoter region of an uncharacterized gene is a predictor that the corresponding gene encodes a putatively secreted protein. consistent with effector function. Furthermore. we are able to experimentally validate that a subset of STATAWAARS-containing genes are specifically expressed in the pharyngeal glands.

However. both of these terms encompass multiple structures of independent evolution. some of which are functionally distinct. We have reviewed the literature on both structures and provide a new perspective on the function of intracellular feeding tubes to maintain the integrity and efficacy of the feeding site. We propose that they provide sufficient hydraulic resistance against the feeding site pressure to prevent it from collapsing during feeding. In addition. we propose that extracellular feeding tubes of migratory ectoparasites should be considered as the functional analogue of the stylet of all other plant-parasitic nematodes for withdrawal of host cell cytoplasm and. therefore. provide an example of convergent evolution.

To understand the role of effectors in host adaptation in nematodes. we analysed the transcriptome of Heterodera sacchari. a cyst nematode parasite of rice (Oryza sativa) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum). A multi‐gene phylogenetic analysis showed that H. sacchari and the cereal cyst nematode Heterodera avenae share a common evolutionary origin and that they evolved to parasitise monocot plants from a common dicot‐parasitic ancestor. We compared the effector repertoires of H. sacchari with those of the dicot parasites Heterodera glycines and Globodera rostochiensis to understand the consequences of this transition.

Pinus sp. Since the early 80's. the notion that another pathogenic agent. namely bacteria. may play a role in PWD has been gaining traction. however the role of bacteria in PWD is still unknown. The present work supports the possibility that some B. xylophilus-associated bacteria may play a significant role in the development of this disease. This is inferred as a consequence of: (i) the phenotypic characterization of a collection of 35 isolates of B. xylophilus-associated bacteria. in different tests broadly used to test plant pathogenic and plant growth promoting bacteria. and (ii) greenhouse experiments that infer the pathogenicity of these bacteria in maritime pine.

The results illustrate the presence of a heterogeneous microbial community associated with B. xylophilus and the traits exhibited by at least. some of these bacteria. appear to be related to PWD symptoms. The inoculation of four specific B. xylophilus-associated bacteria isolates in P. pinaster seedlings resulted in the development of some PWD symptoms suggesting that these bacteria likely play an active role with B. xylophilus in PWD.,True,jqZOPtIAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,54,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046661,17033597907502599231,/scholar?cites=17033597907502599231,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046661,0,0,0
1113552,Influence of physico-chemical properties of porous microcarriers on the adhesion of an anaerobic consortium,2000,MA Pereira and MM Alves and Joana Azeredo and M Mota and Rosário Oliveira,24,Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology,3,181-186,Oxford University Press,The ability for biomass colonization of four porous mineral microcarriers (sepiolite. clay. pozzolana and foam glass-Poraver). was studied and related to their surface properties. The surface hydrophobicity of the mineral carriers was a more important factor influencing colonization by the anaerobic consortium than was surface charge. It was possible to correlate linearly the degree of hydrophobicity with the biomass retention capacity. Although the thermodynamic theory did not explain adhesion. an increase in cell attachment was directly related to the decrease of the positive values of the free energy of adhesion. Surface roughness. porosity and the amount of surface Mg2+. were also determinant factors in bacterial immobilization. However a great biomass accumulation can originate a decrease in biological activity due to mass transfer limitations.

1113553,Pine wilt disease: global issues. trade and economic impact,2008,Jonh Webster and Manuel Mota,,,,,Springer,Pine wilt disease (PWD) is perhaps the most serious threat to pine forests worldwide.  Since it´s discovery in the early XXth century by Japanese forest researchers. and the relationship with its causative agent. the pinewood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. in the 1970s. PWD has wreaked havoc wherever it appears. Firstly in the Far East (Japan. China and Korea) and now. more recently in 1999. in the EU (Portugal).   The forest sector in Portugal plays a major role in the Portuguese economy with a 12% contribution to the industrial gross domestic product. 3.2% of the gross domestic product. 10% of foreign trade and 5% of national employment. Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) is one of the most important pine productions. and industrial activity. such as the production of wood and resin. as well as coastal protection associated with sand dunes. Also. stone pine (Pinus pinea) plays an important role in the economy with a share derived from the exports of high-quality pineon seed. Thus. the tremendous economical and ecological impact of the introduction of a pest and pathogen such as the PWN. although as far as is known.  the only species susceptible to the nematode is maritime pine.  Immediately following detection. the research team involved (Univ. Évora.

Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. is one of the greatest threats to coniferous forests worldwide. causing severe ecological damage and economic loss. The biology of B. xylophilus is similar to that of its closest relative. B. mucronatus. as both species share food resources and insect vectors. and have very similar morphological characteristics. although little pathogenicity to conifers has been associated with B. mucronatus. Using both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers. we show that B. xylophilus and B. mucronatus form distinct phylogenetic groups with contrasting phylogeographic patterns. B. xylophilus presents lower levels of intraspecific diversity than B. mucronatus. as expected for a species that evolved relatively recently through geographical or reproductive isolation. Genetic diversity was particularly low in recently colonised areas. such as in southwestern Europe. By contrast. B. mucronatus displays high levels of genetic diversity and two well-differentiated clades in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA phylogenies. The lack of correlation between genetic and geographic distances in B. mucronatus suggests intense gene flow among distant regions. a phenomenon that may have remained unnoticed due to the reduced pathogenicity of the species. Overall. our findings suggest that B. xylophilus and B. mucronatus have different demographic histories despite their morphological resemblance and ecological overlap.

They play an important role in eukaryotic signal transduction and physiology. mediating cellular responses to a diverse range of extracellular stimuli. The phylum Platyhelminthes is of considerable medical and biological importance. housing major pathogens as well as established model organisms. The recent availability of genomic data for the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni and the model planarian Schmidtea mediterranea paves the way for the first comprehensive effort to identify and analyze GPCRs in this important phylum.

1113570,Neuropeptide signalling systems in flatworms,2005,P McVeigh and MJ Kimber and E Novozhilova and TA Day,131,,S1,S41,,Two distinct families of neuropeptides are known to endow platyhelminth nervous systems–the FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) and the neuropeptide Fs (NPFs). Flatworm FLPs are structurally simple. each 4–6 amino acids in length with a carboxy terminal aromatic-hydrophobic-Arg-Phe-amide motif. Thus far. four distinct flatworm FLPs have been characterized. with only one of these from a parasite. They have a widespread distribution within the central and peripheral nervous system of every flatworm examined. including neurones serving the attachment organs. the somatic musculature and the reproductive system. The only physiological role that has been identified for flatworm FLPs is myoexcitation. Flatworm NPFs are believed to be invertebrate homologues of the vertebrate neuropeptide Y (NPY) family of peptides. Flatworm NPFs are 36–39 amino acids in length and are characterized by a caboxy terminal GRPRFamide signature and conserved tyrosine residues at positions 10 and 17 from the carboxy terminal. Like FLPs. NPF occurs throughout flatworm nervous systems. although less is known about its biological role. While there is some evidence for a myoexcitatory action in cestodes and flukes. more compelling physiological data indicate that flatworm NPF inhibits cAMP levels in a manner that is characteristic of NPY action in vertebrates. The widespread expression of these neuropeptides in flatworm parasites highlights the potential of these signalling systems to yield new targets for novel anthelmintics.

Because medical treatment is currently based on a single drug. praziquantel. there is urgent need for the development of alternative control strategies. The Schistosoma mansoni genome project provides a platform to study and connect the genetic repertoire of schistosomes to specific biological functions essential for successful parasitism. G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the largest superfamily of transmembrane receptors throughout the Eumetazoan phyla. including platyhelminths. Due to their involvement in diverse biological processes. their pharmacological importance. and proven druggability. GPCRs are promising targets for new anthelmintics. However. to identify candidate receptors. a more detailed understanding of the roles of GPCR signalling in schistosome biology is essential. An updated phylogenetic analysis of the S. mansoni GPCR genome (GPCRome) is presented. facilitated by updated genome data that allowed a more precise annotation of GPCRs. Additionally. we review the current knowledge on GPCR signalling in this parasite and provide new insights into the potential roles of GPCRs in schistosome reproduction based on the findings of a recent tissue-specific transcriptomic study in paired and unpaired S. mansoni.

One yet unaddressed issue is whether the progression of atherosclerosis is associated with an increase in DNA methylation drift in the vascular tissue. The purpose of the study was to identify CpG methylation profiles that vary with the progression of atherosclerosis in the human aorta. We interrogated a set of donor-matched atherosclerotic and normal aortic samples ranging from histological grade III to VII. with a high-density (>450.000 CpG sites) DNA methylation microarray. We detected a correlation between histological grade and intra-pair differential methylation for 1.985 autosomal CpGs. the vast majority of which drifted towards hypermethylation with lesion progression. The identified CpG loci map to genes that are regulated by known critical transcription factors involved in atherosclerosis and participate in inflammatory and immune responses. Functional relevance was corroborated by crossing the DNA methylation profiles with expression data obtained in the same human aorta sample set. by a transcriptome-wide analysis of murine atherosclerotic aortas and from available public databases.

Hence. improvement of bioprocess productivity is greatly needed. A temperature downshift (TDS) from 37°C to 28–34°C is an effective strategy to expand the productive life period of cells and increase their productivity (qp). Here. TDS in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures. initially grown at 37°C and switched to 30°C during the exponential growth phase. resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in the qp of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rh-tPA). The transcriptomic response using next-generation sequencing (NGS) was assessed to characterize the cellular behavior associated with TDS. A total of 416 (q > 0.8) and 3.472 (q > 0.9) differentially expressed transcripts. with more than a 1.6-fold change at 24 and 48 h post TDS. respectively. were observed in cultures with TDS compared to those at constant 37°C. In agreement with the extended cell survival resulting from TDS. transcripts related to cell growth arrest that controlled cell proliferation without the activation of the DNA damage response. were differentially expressed. Most upregulated genes were related to energy metabolism in mitochondria. mitochondrial biogenesis. central metabolism. and avoidance of apoptotic cell death. The gene coding for rh-tPA was not differentially expressed. but fluctuations were detected in the transcripts encoding proteins involved in the secretory machinery. particularly in glycosylation. Through NGS the dynamic processes caused by TDS were assessed in this biological system.,True,nakT8QUAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,36,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151529,12879959942395906365,/scholar?cites=12879959942395906365,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151529,0,0,0

These bacterial communities play an important role in several biogeochemical cycles in the marine ecosystem. In particular. the Gulf of Mexico has a ubiquitous concentration of hydrocarbons in its sediments. representing a very interesting niche to explore. Additionally. the Mexican government has opened its oil industry. offering several exploration and production blocks in shallow and deep water in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico (swGoM). from which there are no public results of conducted studies. Given the higher risk of large-scale oil spills. the design of contingency plans and mitigation activities before oil exploitation is of growing concern. Therefore. a bacterial taxonomic baseline profile is crucial to understanding the impact of any eventual oil spill. Here. we show a genus level taxonomic profile to elucidate the bacterial baseline. pointing out richness and relative abundance. as well as relationships with 79 abiotic parameters. in an area encompassing ~150.000 km2. including a region where the exploitation of new oil wells has already been authorized.

Low agricultural productivity. exploding populations. and escalating urbanization have led to declining per capita food availability. In order to reverse this trend. crop production systems must intensify. which brings with it an elevated threat from pests and diseases. including plant-parasitic nematodes. A holistic systems approach to pest management recognizes disciplinary integration. However. a critical under-representation of nematology expertise is a pivotal shortcoming. especially given the magnitude of the threat nematodes pose under more intensified systems.

Conventionally an integrated approach to PPN management has relied heavily on carbamate. organophosphate and fumigant nematicides which are now being withdrawn over environmental health and safety concerns. This progressive withdrawal has left a significant shortcoming in our ability to manage these economically important parasites. and highlights the need for novel and robust control methods. Nematodes can assimilate exogenous peptides through retrograde transport along the chemosensory amphid neurons. Peptides can accumulate within cells of the central nerve ring and can elicit physiological effects when released to interact with receptors on adjoining cells.

A central tenet of nematode neurobiology is the marriage of structural simplicity with signalling complexity. a feature that has likely contributed to the outstanding success of nematodes. which sees them dominate metazoan biomass (Lambshead. 2004). While their structure is remarkably simple. their behavioural capacity and adaptability is well evidenced by the great variety in life styles displayed by their free-living and parasitic members. Apparently regardless of their behavioural diversity. freeliving and parasitic nematodes (for which data are available) appear to possess nervous systems of very similar construction. Therefore. it would seem that their remarkable behavioural plasticity derives largely from the variation within their repertoire of signalling molecules rather than their largely invariant nervous system structure.The most detailed structural comparisons of nervous systems derive from the outstanding efforts of White and co-workers in mapping the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans (White et al.. 1976. 1986). and of Goldschmidt and workers in the Stretton laboratory who have unravelled much nervous system detail for the large gastrointestinal pig parasite Ascaris,True,RD_-0OgAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,3,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=4Y5cBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA279&dq=info:H2LmcB32cR4J:scholar.google.com&ots=gS86qkC1Xq&sig=b6vm4bxlmCYRgwvBdxlrRDcMUpA,2193805099814773279,/scholar?cites=2193805099814773279,,,0,0,0

Our data show that S. carpocapsae is sensitive to neuronal RNAi. and that knockdown of flp-21 has a significant impact on dispersal. nictation and jumping behaviours. Immunocytochemical localisation of FLP-21 to paired anterior neurons corroborates the RNAi data. further suggesting a role in sensory modulation.

Neospora caninum is a recently discovered close relative of Toxoplasma. whose definitive host is the dog. Both species are tissue-dwelling Coccidia and members of the phylum Apicomplexa; they share many common features. but Neospora neither infects humans nor shares the same wide host range as Toxoplasma. rather it shows a striking preference for highly efficient vertical transmission in cattle.

1113672,Application of whole genome sequencing to the study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,2016,H Naghra,,,,,,The reduction in cost and increase in throughput of whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies. and the advent of benchtop WGS instruments such as the Illumina MiSeq. means that WGS is no longer restricted to large genome centres and consortia. The number of microbial genomes in public repositories is ever increasing due to the availability of WGS technologies to research groups. with individual genera having their own dedicated genome databases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and a major cause of healthcare associated infection in immunocompromised individuals and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The first complete genome sequence of a P. aeruginosa strain was that of the most commonly studied laboratory strain P. aeruginosa PAO1. sequenced in 2000. It was found in a study. published in 2010. that there were differences between the chromosomal sequences of two isolates of P. aeruginosa PAO1 originating from two different public strain collections. as well as differences compared to the reference sequence. It was therefore proposed that P. aeruginosa PAO1 exists as variable sublines in strain collections. whose differences included a 2.2~Mb chromosomal inversion and a prophage insertion compared to the reference sequence. as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short insertions and deletions (INDELs) which are unique to individual sublines. Since the current genomic reference sequence is based on one of these variable sublines. this study aims to deduce the sequence of the original P. aeruginosa Strain 1 (PAO) from which all the PAO1 sublines are derived. using …,True,m2DJwlYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.689922,,,,,0,0,0

In a classical ABE fermentation. bacteria first produce organic acids but then shift their metabolism toward formation of solvents such as acetone. butanol. and ethanol. Importantly. this shift strongly depends on several environmental parameters. Among these. the external pH takes a special position. Unable to maintain a constant internal pH. clostridial cells allow it to change in accordance with the external pH and couple their metabolism to a constant transmembrane pH gradient instead. Accordingly. a detailed knowledge of pH-dependent properties of cellular components and regulatory processes is a crucial prerequisite for purposeful engineering of these organisms.In recent years. the transnational COSMIC consortium. including several German. Dutch. and British groups. investigated the pH-induced metabolic shift of C. acetobutylicum using a systems biology approach. Here. systematic experiments in continuous culture proved that the shift of glucosegrown acid forming cells at a pH> 5.2. to solvent formation at a pH< 5.1. is accompanied by radical changes in transcriptome. proteome. and metabolome. However. a mathematical model of the underlying metabolic network revealed that these experimentally observed changes are insufficient to explain the time courses of the fermentation products measured in shift experiments.

While some species have a broad host range and cause damage to a variety of crops. others are restricted to only closely related plant species. While probing and feeding aphids secrete saliva. containing effectors. into their hosts to manipulate host cell processes and promote infestation. Aphid effector discovery studies pointed out parallels between infection and infestation strategies of plant pathogens and aphids. Interestingly. resistance to some aphid species is known to involve plant resistance proteins with a typical NB-LRR domain structure. Whether these resistance proteins indeed recognize aphid effectors to trigger ETI remains to be elucidated. In addition. it was recently shown that unknown aphid derived elicitors can initiate ROS (reactive oxygen species) production and callose deposition and that these responses were dependent on BAK1 (BRASSINOSTERIOD INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1) which is a key component of the plant immune system. In addition. BAK-1 contributes to nonhost resistance to aphids pointing to another parallel between plant-pathogen and –aphid interactions. Understanding the role of plant immunity and non-host resistance to aphids is essential to generate durable and sustainable aphid control strategies. Although insect behavior plays a role in host selection and non-host resistance. an important observation is that aphids interact with nonhost plants by probing the leaf surface. but are unable to feed or establish colonization.

We generate a high quality genome assembly for G. rostochiensis pathotype Ro1. identify putative effectors and horizontal gene transfer events. map gene expression through the life cycle focusing on key parasitic transitions and sequence the genomes of eight populations including four additional pathotypes to identify variation. Horizontal gene transfer contributes 3.5 % of the predicted genes. of which approximately 8.5 % are deployed as effectors. Over one-third of all effector genes are clustered in 21 putative ‘effector islands’ in the genome.

While feeding and probing these insects deliver molecules. called effectors. inside their host to enable infestation. The identification and characterization of these effectors from different species that vary in their host range is an important step in understanding the infestation success of aphids and aphid host range variation. This study employs a multi-disciplinary approach based on transcriptome sequencing and proteomics to identify and compare effector candidates from the broad host range aphid Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) (genotypes O. J and F). and narrow host range aphids Myzus cerasi (black cherry aphid) and Rhopalosiphum padi (bird-cherry oat aphid). Using a combination of aphid transcriptome sequencing on libraries derived from head versus body tissues as well as saliva proteomics we were able to predict candidate effectors repertoires from the different aphid species and genotypes. Among the identified conserved or core effector sets. we identified a significant number of previously identified aphid candidate effectors indicating these proteins may be involved in general infestation strategies. Moreover. we identified aphid candidate effector sequences that were specific to one species. which are interesting candidates for further validation and characterization with regards to species-specific functions during infestation.

These highly disturbed sites with diverse planting practices may indeed act as harbours for invasive Phytophthora pathogens which are particularly well adapted to surviving in soil. High throughput Illumina sequencing was used to analyse Phytophthora species diversity in soil samples collected from 14 public garden/amenity woodland sites in northern Britain. Bioinformatic analyses revealed some limitations to using internal transcribed spacer as the barcode region; namely reporting of false positives and ambiguous species matches.

Phytophthora pseudosyringae and P. austrocedri. both of which cause serious damage to trees and are regarded as fairly recent introductions to Britain. were the two most abundant Phytophthora species detected.

1113710,Bioinformatic and functional characterisation of Globodera pallida effector genes,2012,Peter Thorpe,,,,,,Pathogens secrete molecules. termed effectors. to manipulate their host to the benefit of the pathogen. Effectors of plant parasitic nematodes are predicted to have a range of functions such as facilitating invasion. initiation and maintenance of the feeding site. and suppression of host defences. The genome sequence of the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida was analysed to identify putative effectors. They include: 129 effectors similar to those previously identified from cyst nematodes. 53 cell wall modifying enzymes and 117 novel putative effectors. Only four effectors were common between G. pallida and the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. These could have a conserved role in plant parasitism. A large SPRY domain containing gene family was identified in G. pallida. It has 299 members. of which 30 are predicted to be secreted and therefore categorised as effectors. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the family is hugely expanded and specific to Globodera species.  Fifty-four putative effectors were cloned from G. pallida cDNA. Transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum tuberosum L. ‘Désirée’ were produced. to express a range of these effectors and act as tools for functional characterisation. Potato lines that expressed selected effectors were subjected to phenotypic analysis and pathogen susceptibility assays. The largest range of aberrant phenotypes was observed for those plants expressing GpIA7 and GpIVG9. Potato lines expressing GpIA7 showed altered growth phenotypes and an increased susceptibility to Phytophthora infestans CS-12.

Two resistance sources. GpaV (from Solanum vernei) and H3 from S. tuberosum ssp. andigena CPC2802 (from the Commonwealth Potato Collection) are widely used in potato breeding programmes in European potato industry. However. the use of resistant cultivars may drive strong selection towards virulence. which allows the increase in frequency of virulent alleles in the population and therefore. the emergence of highly virulent nematode lineages. This study aimed to identify Avirulence (Avr) genes in G. pallida populations selected for virulence on the above resistance sources. and the genomic impact of selection processes on the nematode. The selection drive in the populations was found to be specific to their genetic background. At the genomic level. 11 genes were found that represent candidate Avr genes. Most of the variant calls determining selection were associated with H3-selected populations. while many of them seem to be organised in genomic islands facilitating selection evolution.

These insects feature complex life cycles. which in the case of many agriculturally important species involves the use of primary and secondary host plant species. The switching between winter or primary hosts. on which overwintering eggs are laid upon sexual reproduction. and the secondary hosts. on which aphids reproduce asexually by parthenogenesis. is called host alternation. Here. we used Myzus cerasi (black cherry aphid). which overwinters on cherry trees and in summer spreads to herbaceous plant species. to assess aphid transcriptional changes that occur upon host alternation.Adaptation experiments of M. cerasi collected from local cherry tress to reported secondary host species revealed low survival rates when aphids were moved to two secondary host species. Moreover. aphids were unable to survive on one of the reported hosts (Land cress) unless first adapted to another secondary host (cleavers). Transcriptome analyses of populations adapted to the primary host cherry and two secondary host species showed extensive transcriptional plasticity to host alternation. with predominantly genes involved in oxidation-reduction differentially regulated. Most of the differentially expressed genes across the M. cerasi populations from the different hosts were duplicated and we found evidence for differential exon usage.

Here we first report such a case in stinkbugs of the family Plataspidae. wherein a specific gut bacterium is vertically transmitted via “symbiont capsule.” In all of the plataspid species. females produced symbiont capsules upon oviposition and their gut exhibited specialized traits for capsule production. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the plataspid symbionts constituted a distinct group in the γ-Proteobacteria. whose sister group was the aphid obligate endocellular symbionts Buchnera. Removal of the symbionts resulted in retarded growth. mortality. and sterility of the insects. The host phylogeny perfectly agreed with the symbiont phylogeny. indicating strict host-symbiont cospeciation despite the extracellular association. The symbionts exhibited AT-biased nucleotide composition. accelerated molecular evolution. and reduced genome size. as has been observed in obligate endocellular insect symbionts. These findings suggest that not the endocellular conditions themselves but the population genetic attributes of the vertically transmitted symbionts are probably responsible for the peculiar genetic traits of these insect symbionts.

After infection. wMelPop disseminates widely in the mosquito. infecting the fat body. head. sensory organs and other tissues but is notably absent from the midgut and ovaries. Wolbachia initially induces the mosquito immune system. coincident with initial clearing of the infection. but then suppresses expression of immune genes. coincident with Wolbachia replication in the mosquito. Both wMelPop and wAlbB significantly inhibit Plasmodium falciparum oocyst levels in the mosquito midgut. Although not virulent in non-bloodfed mosquitoes. wMelPop exhibits a novel phenotype and is extremely virulent for approximately 12–24 hours post-bloodmeal. after which surviving mosquitoes exhibit similar mortality trajectories to control mosquitoes. The data suggest that if stable transinfections act in a similar manner to somatic infections. Wolbachia could potentially be used as part of a strategy to control the Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria.,True,4puhKfoAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,291,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002043,15611459078473063950,/scholar?cites=15611459078473063950,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002043,0,0,0

Originally. however. such obligate symbiotic bacteria must have been derived from free-living bacteria. How highly specialized obligate mutualisms have arisen from less specialized associations is of interest. Here we address this evolutionary issue by focusing on an exceptional insect–Wolbachia nutritional mutualism. Although Wolbachia endosymbionts are ubiquitously found in diverse insects and generally regarded as facultative/parasitic associates for their insect hosts. a Wolbachia strain associated with the bedbug Cimex lectularius. designated as wCle. was shown to be essential for host’s growth and reproduction via provisioning of B vitamins.

We show that 26% of the Pba genome exhibited differential transcription in a QS (expI-) mutant. compared to the wild-type. suggesting that QS may make a greater contribution to pathogenesis than previously thought.

Recent reports have indicated that RXLR effectors are translocated from the extrahaustorial matrix during the biotrophic phase of infection and that they are able to suppress PAMP-triggered immunity. Oomycete genomes contain potentially hundreds of highly diverse RXLR effector genes. providing the potential for considerable functional redundancy and the consequent ability to readily shed effectors that are recognised by plant surveillance systems without compromising pathogenic fitness.

However. little is known about the host targets of these effectors and how they are manipulated by the pathogen. This work describes the identification of two putative membrane-associated NAC transcription factors (TF) as the host targets of the RxLR effector PITG_03192 (Pi03192). The effector interacts with NAC Targeted by Phytophthora (NTP) 1 and NTP2 at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. where these proteins are localised. Transcripts of NTP1 and NTP2 rapidly accumulate following treatment with culture filtrate (CF) from in vitro grown P. infestans. which acts as a mixture of Phytophthora PAMPs and elicitors. but significantly decrease during P. infestans infection. indicating that pathogen activity may prevent their up-regulation. Silencing of NTP1 or NTP2 in the model host plant Nicotiana benthamiana increases susceptibility to P. infestans. whereas silencing of Pi03192 in P. infestans reduces pathogenicity. Transient expression of Pi03192 in planta restores pathogenicity of the Pi03192-silenced line. Moreover. colonisation by the Pi03192-silenced line is significantly enhanced on N. benthamiana plants in which either NTP1 or NTP2 have been silenced. StNTP1 and StNTP2 proteins are released from the ER membrane following treatment with P. infestans CF and accumulate in the nucleus. after which they are rapidly turned over by the 26S proteasome.

In this review we discuss the interaction of plant defences with microbial pathogens such as bacteria. fungi and oomycetes. and viruses. We examine principles of complex dynamic networks that allow identification of network components that are differentially and predictably sensitive to perturbation. thus making them likely effector targets. We relate these principles to recent developments in our understanding of known effector targets in plant-pathogen systems. and propose a systems-level framework for the interpretation and modelling of host–microbe interactions mediated by effectors. We describe this framework briefly. and conclude by discussing useful experimental approaches for populating this framework.,True,5QhdsWkAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,79,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168945210003456,18068086084552569214,/scholar?cites=18068086084552569214,,,0,0,0

It has been demonstrated that transposition largely depends on intraspecific hybridization for P. hobo. and I elements in Drosophila melanogaster and for several elements. including long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons. in D. virilis. However. in order to demonstrate the putative effect of transposable elements on speciation. high levels of transposition should also be induced in hybrids between species that could have been originated by this process and that are still able to interbreed.

During four years of research. samples of mating and non‐mating adults and pupae were taken from a natural population. The main adult fitness components. i.e.. mating success. longevity. and fecundity. were recorded in relation to body size. as measured by thorax length. The age of flies was estimated by observing the developmental stage of the reproductive system.

Contrary to the view that hybrids are lineages devoid of evolutionary value. a number of case studies are given that show how hybrids are responsible for reticulate evolution that may lead to the origin of new species. Hybrid evolution is mediated by extensive genome repatterning followed by rapid stabilization and fixation of highly adapted genotypes. Some well-documented cases demonstrate that bursts of transposition follow hybridization and may contribute to the genetic instability observed after hybridization. The mechanism that triggers transposition in hybrids is largely unknown. but coupling of hybrid transposition and demethylation has been observed in mammals and plants.

1113785,Genetic instability and rapid speciation: are they coupled?,1992,A Fontdevila,86,Genetica,1,247-258,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Models of rapid speciation by fixation of underdominant chromosomal rearrangements are constrained by multiple conditions on population structure and chromosomal performance. Realistic population conditions impose long periods of time to fixation or reproductive isolation. even under a model of accumulation of successive advantageous slightly underdominant rearrangements. However. when increased mutation rates are considered. fixation time is significantly reduced. Evidence is presented of high rates of chromosomal rearrangement production under genomic stress. such as in inbred and interspecific crosses. These episodes of high instability are most probably the result of mobile element transpositions. since transposition is also increased under genomic stress. Nonetheless. the evolutionary value of mobile elements to speed up speciation will be only significant if their mutagenic potential is …,True,LHaufk4AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,67,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00133723,13668203186538909259,/scholar?cites=13668203186538909259,,,0,0,0

The mechanistic explanation for this colinearity has been elusive. and it may well be that a single and universal cause does not exist. The Hox-gene complex (HOM-C) has been rearranged differently in several Drosophila species. producing a striking diversity of Hox gene organizations. We investigated the genomic and functional consequences of the two HOM-C splits present in Drosophila buzzatii. Firstly. we sequenced two regions of the D. buzzatii genome. one containing the genes labial and abdominal A. and another one including proboscipedia. and compared their organization with that of D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura in order to map precisely the two splits.

In this work. we estimate how much HRi impedes the rate of adaptive evolution in the coding genome of Drosophila melanogaster. We compiled a data set of 6.141 autosomal protein-coding genes from Drosophila. from which polymorphism levels in D. melanogaster and divergence out to D. yakuba were estimated. The rate of adaptive evolution was calculated using a derivative of the McDonald–Kreitman test that controls for slightly deleterious mutations.

A common observation is that successful inversions are of intermediate size. We test here the hypothesis that the selected property is the recombination length of inversions. not their physical length. If so. physical length of successful inversions should be negatively correlated with recombination rate across species. This prediction was tested by a comprehensive statistical analysis of inversion size and recombination map length in 12 Diptera species for which appropriate data are available.

In this study. we evaluated the differences in levels of synonymous polymorphism among Drosophila species and showed that these differences can be explained by differences in effective population size. The differences can have implications for the molecular evolution of the Drosophila species. as is suggested by our results showing that the levels of codon bias and the proportion of adaptive substitutions are both higher in species with higher levels of synonymous polymorphism. Moreover. species with lower synonymous polymorphism have higher levels of nonsynonymous polymorphism and larger content of repetitive sequences in their genomes. suggesting a diminished efficiency of selection in species with smaller effective population size.,True,mgTpCTIAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,42,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01672.x,3915864370110873917,/scholar?cites=3915864370110873917,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01672.x,0,0,0

1113813,What does electrophoretic variation tell us about protein variation?,1996,A Barbadilla and LM King and RC Lewontin,13,Mol Biol Evol.,2,427-32,Oxford Academic,Before the introduction of DNA sequencing methods into population genetics by Kreitman (1983). the major source of information about genetic variation among organisms in natural populations came from electrophoretic studies of proteins. The amount of information acquired during 25 years of major electrophoretic activity is staggering and. for purely technical reasons. is likely to remain orders of magnitude greater in number of genes. number of individuals. and number of species examined than can be acquired from nucleotide sequence data. It would be extremely desirable if this mass of data on electrophoretic phenotypes could be translated into data on patterns of amino acid variation. using the information now available for a handful of cases where amino acid variation in natural populations has been definitively ascertained from DNA sequence variation. It is the purpose of this paper to show that while the total amount of amino acid variability can be inferred from electrophoretic data. the different patterns of electrophoretic class frequency distributions do not allow any other inferences. because those patterns can be generated by the simplest null model of the generation of electrophoretic variation from amino acid variation. without the need to make any assumptions about selection or population structure. The charge-state model (or the stepwise mutation model) was originally proposed by Ohta and Kimura (1973) to deal with electrophoretic data. This model assumes that only amino acid changes resulting in significant charge changes are clearly detectable.

Recent empirical evidence also gives credence to earlier speculations suggesting that estimates of heritability could drop with slower heating rates. 2. Using published data from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. we show that empirical patterns can be explained if flies’ physical condition decreases with experimental time in thermal tolerance assays.

However. little is known about the degree of genetic and non‐genetic influences on the phenotypic expression of functionally based traits. Many studies have assessed the heritability of craniofacial traits. but complex patterns of correlation among traits have been disregarded. This is a pitfall as the human skull is strongly integrated. Here we reconsider the evolutionary potential of craniometric traits by assessing their heritability values as well as their patterns of genetic and phenotypic correlation using a large pedigree‐structured skull series from Hallstatt (Austria).

Here. we argue that the general premise that a single temperature can accurately describe upper or lower tolerance limits is incorrect. Survival probability is determined by both the intensity and the duration of a thermal stress. and the association between these variables can be adequately conveyed by a thermal tolerance landscape. Employing this framework. we demonstrate that the temperature range that an organism can tolerate is expected to narrow down with the duration of the thermal challenge. Analyses suggest that a trade‐off exists between tolerances to acute and chronic exposition to thermal stress. and that changes in temperature means or extremes may result in drastically different selective pressures and subsequent evolutionary responses.

The replicator concept is at the core of genetics-first theories of the origin of life. which suggest that self-replicating oligonucleotides or their similar ancestors may have been the first “living” systems and may have led to the evolution of an RNA world. But problems with the nonenzymatic synthesis of biopolymers and the origin of template replication have spurred the alternative metabolism-first scenario. where self-reproducing and evolving proto-metabolic networks are assumed to have predated self-replicating genes. Recent theoretical work shows that “compositional genomes” (i.e.. the counts of different molecular species in an assembly) are able to propagate compositional information and can provide a setup on which natural selection acts.

In April 2011. a strong heat wave struck extensive geographical areas of the world. including Western Europe. At that time. we happened to resume and extend a long-term time series of seasonal genetic data in the widespread fly Drosophila subobscura. which provided a unique opportunity to quantify the intensity of the genetic perturbation caused by the heat wave. We show that the spring 2011 genetic constitution of the populations transiently shifted to summer-like frequencies. and that the magnitude of the genetic anomaly quantitatively matched the temperature anomaly. The results provide compelling evidence that direct effects of rising temperature are driving adaptive evolutionary shifts. and also suggest a strong genetic resilience in this species.,True,7j1hdvwAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC,79,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0228,5342897812811759625,/scholar?cites=5342897812811759625,,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0228,0,0,0

One solution has been to suggest the existence of a cyclically coupled system of autocatalytic and cross-catalytic molecular mutualists. where each member helps the following member and receives help from the preceding one (i.e.. a “hypercycle”). However. such a system is evolutionarily unstable when mutations are taken into account because it lacks individuality. In time. the cooperating networks of genes should have been encapsulated in a cell-like structure. But once the cell was invented. it closely aligned genes' common interests and helped to reduce gene selfishness. so there was no need for hypercycles.

1113862,Identification of polymorphic inversions from genotypes,2012,Alejandro Cáceres and Suzanne S Sindi and Benjamin J Raphael and Mario Cáceres and Juan R González,13,BMC bioinformatics,1,1-16,BioMed Central,Polymorphic inversions are a source of genetic variability with a direct impact on recombination frequencies. Given the difficulty of their experimental study. computational methods have been developed to infer their existence in a large number of individuals using genome-wide data of nucleotide variation. Methods based on haplotype tagging of known inversions attempt to classify individuals as having a normal or inverted allele. Other methods that measure differences between linkage disequilibrium attempt to identify regions with inversions but unable to classify subjects accurately. an essential requirement for association studies. We present a novel method to both identify polymorphic inversions from genome-wide genotype data and classify individuals as containing a normal or inverted allele. Our method. a generalization of a published method for haplotype data [1]. utilizes linkage between groups of SNPs to partition a set of individuals into normal and inverted subpopulations. We employ a sliding window scan to identify regions likely to have an inversion. and accumulation of evidence from neighboring SNPs is used to accurately determine the inversion status of each subject.

The evolutionary history of these inversions and the mechanisms by which they arise are therefore of significant interest.

A common observation is that successful inversions are of intermediate size. We test here the hypothesis that the selected property is the recombination length of inversions. not their physical length. If so. physical length of successful inversions should be negatively correlated with recombination rate across species. This prediction was tested by a comprehensive statistical analysis of inversion size and recombination map length in 12 Diptera species for which appropriate data are available. We found that (1) there is a wide variation in recombination map length among species; (2) physical length of successful inversions varies greatly among species and is inversely correlated with the species recombination map length; and (3) neither the among-species variation in inversion length nor the correlation are …,True,qbNYSnoAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,43,https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/153/1/251/6047849,13318788565144308849,/scholar?cites=13318788565144308849,,https://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/153/1/251.full.pdf,0,0,0

Methodology/Principal Findings We have investigated the genome-wide profile of structural variation on pooled samples from the three populations studied in the HapMap project by comparative genome hybridization (CGH) in different array platforms. We have identified and experimentally validated 33 genomic loci that show significant copy number differences from one population to the other. Interestingly. we found an enrichment of genes related to environment adaptation (immune response. lipid metabolism and extracellular space) within these regions and the study of expression data revealed that more than half of the copy number variants (CNVs) translate into gene-expression differences among populations. suggesting that they could have functional consequences. In addition. the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are in linkage disequilibrium with the copy number alleles allowed us to detect evidences of population differentiation and recent selection at the nucleotide variation level.  Conclusions Overall. our results provide a comprehensive view of relevant copy number changes that might play a role in phenotypic differences among major human populations. and generate a list of interesting candidates for future studies.,True,qbNYSnoAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,36,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007230,8691342598611411288,/scholar?cites=8691342598611411288,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007230,0,0,0

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that gene flow occurred from bonobos into the ancestors of central and eastern chimpanzees between 200.000 and 550.000 years ago. probably with subsequent spread into Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees.

Here. we present the results from a large-sample resequencing (n = 285 patients) study of candidate genes coupled with population genetics and statistical methods to identify rare variants associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia. Three genes. MAP1A. GRIN2B. and CACNA1F. were consistently identified by different methods as having significant excess of rare missense mutations in either one or both disease cohorts. In a broader context. we also found that the overall site frequency spectrum of variation in these cases is best explained by population models of both selection and complex demography rather than neutral models or models accounting for complex demography alone. Mutations in the three disease-associated genes explained much of the difference in the overall site frequency spectrum among the cases versus controls. This study demonstrates that genes associated with complex disorders can be mapped using resequencing and analytical methods with sample sizes far smaller than those required by genome-wide association studies.

1113897,The impact of transposable elements in environmental adaptation,2013,Elena Casacuberta and Josefa González,22,,6,1503-1517,,Transposable elements (TEs) play an important role in the responsive capacity of their hosts in the face of environmental challenges. The variety of mechanisms by which TEs influence the capacity of adaptation of the host is as large as the variety of TEs and host genomes. For example. TEs might directly affect the function of individual genes. provide a mechanism for rapidly acquiring new genetic material and disseminate regulatory elements that can lead to the creation of stress‐inducible regulatory networks. In this review. we summarize recent examples that are part of an increasing body of evidence suggesting a significant role of TEs in the host response to an ever‐changing environment. both in prokaryote and in eukaryote organisms.

In this work. we conduct a genome-wide screen for adaptive TE insertions in Drosophila melanogaster that have taken place during or after the spread of this species out of Africa. We determine population frequencies of 902 of the 1.572 TEs in Release 3 of the D. melanogaster genome and identify a set of 13 putatively adaptive TEs. These 13 TEs increased in population frequency sharply after the spread out of Africa. We argue that many of these TEs are in fact adaptive by demonstrating that the regions flanking five of these TEs display signatures of partial selective sweeps. Furthermore. we show that eight out of the 13 putatively adaptive elements show population frequency heterogeneity consistent with these elements playing a role in adaptation to temperate climates. We conclude that TEs have contributed considerably to recent adaptive evolution (one TE-induced adaptation every 200–1.250 y). The majority of these adaptive insertions are likely to be involved in regulatory changes. Our results also suggest that TE-induced adaptations arise more often from standing variants than from new mutations. Such a high rate of TE-induced adaptation is inconsistent with the number of fixed TEs in the D. melanogaster genome. and we discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy.,True,sZ7bVcsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,174,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060251,7083930920575574237,/scholar?cites=7083930920575574237,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060251,0,0,0

A clear and thorough understanding of the population dynamics of TEs is therefore essential for full comprehension of the eukaryotic genome evolution and function. Although TEs in Drosophila melanogaster have received much attention. population dynamics of most TE families in this species remains entirely unexplored. It is not clear whether the same population processes can account for the population behaviors of all TEs in Drosophila or whether. as has been suggested previously. different orders behave according to very different rules.

Drosophila is a particularly good model to study adaptation to environmental heterogeneity since it is a tropical species that originated in sub-Saharan Africa and has only recently colonized the rest of the world. There is strong evidence for the adaptive role of Transposable Elements (TEs) in the evolution of Drosophila. and TEs might play an important role specifically in adaptation to temperate climates. In this work. we analyzed the frequency of a set of putatively adaptive and putatively neutral TEs in populations with contrasting climates that were collected near the endpoints of two known latitudinal clines in Australia and North America. The contrasting results obtained for putatively adaptive and putatively neutral TEs and the consistency of the patterns between continents strongly suggest that putatively adaptive TEs are involved in adaptation to temperate climates. We integrated information on population behavior. possible environmental selective agents. and both molecular and functional information of the TEs and their nearby genes to infer the plausible phenotypic consequences of these insertions. We conclude that adaptation to temperate environments is widespread in Drosophila and that TEs play a significant role in this adaptation. It is remarkable that such a diverse set of TEs located next to a diverse set of genes are consistently adaptive to temperate climate-related factors.

We assessed the accuracy of this approach on whole. complex eukaryotic genomes by resequencing pools of largely isogenic. individually sequenced Drosophila melanogaster strains. We called SNPs in the pooled data and estimated false positive and false negative rates using the SNPs called in individual strain as a reference. We also estimated allele frequency of the SNPs using “pooled” data and compared them with “true” frequencies taken from the estimates in the individual strains. We demonstrate that pooled sequencing provides a faithful estimate of population allele frequency with the error well approximated by binomial sampling. and is a reliable means of novel SNP discovery with low false positive rates. However. a sufficient number of strains should be used in the pooling because variation in the amount of DNA derived from individual strains is a substantial source of noise when the number of pooled strains is low. Our results and analysis confirm that pooled sequencing is a very powerful and cost-effective technique for assessing of patterns of sequence variation in populations on genome-wide scales. and is applicable to any dataset where sequencing individuals or individual cells is impossible. difficult. time consuming. or expensive.,True,sZ7bVcsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,85,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041901,17145066361332583230,/scholar?cites=17145066361332583230,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041901,0,0,0

Despite recent progress. our understanding of the adaptive process is still very limited due to the difficulties in linking adaptive mutations to their phenotypic effects. In this study. we integrated different levels of biological information to pinpoint the ecologically relevant fitness effects and the underlying molecular and biochemical mechanisms of a putatively adaptive TE insertion in Drosophila melanogaster: the pogo transposon FBti0019627. We showed that other than being incorporated into Kmn1 transcript. FBti0019627 insertion also affects the polyadenylation signal choice of CG11699 gene. Consequently. only the short 3′UTR transcript of CG11699 gene is produced and the expression level of this gene is higher in flies with the insertion. Our results indicated that increased CG11699 expression leads to xenobiotic stress resistance through increased ALDH-III activity: flies with FBti0019627 insertion showed increased survival rate in response to benzaldehyde. a natural xenobiotic. and to carbofuran. a synthetic insecticide. Although differences in survival rate between flies with and without the insertion were not always significant. when they were. they were consistent with FBti0019627 mediating resistance to xenobiotics.

1113916,Evolution of genome content: population dynamics of transposable elements in flies and humans,2012,Josefa Gonzalez and Dmitri A Petrov,,,,361-383,Humana Press. Totowa. NJ,Recent research is starting to shed light on the factors that influence the population and evolutionary dynamics of transposable elements (TEs) and TE life cycles. Genomes differ sharply in the number of TE copies. in the level of TE activity. in the diversity of TE families and types. and in the proportion of old and young TEs. In this chapter. we focus on two well-studied genomes with strikingly different architectures. humans and Drosophila. which represent two extremes in terms of TE diversity and population dynamics. We argue that some of the answers might lie in (1) the larger population size and consequently more effective selection against new TE insertions due to ectopic recombination in flies compared to humans; and (2) in the faster rate of DNA loss in flies compared to humans leading to much faster removal of fixed TE copies from the fly genome.,True,sZ7bVcsAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,38,https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-61779-582-4_13,1676008836158329136,/scholar?cites=1676008836158329136,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50647406/81.pdf,0,0,0

However. if colonization occurs through a small number of founders. the genetic composition of the colonized population may differ from that of the original population simply due to genetic drift. Disentangling the effects of founder drift and selection after colonization is crucial to understanding the adaptive process. Drosophila buzzatii colonized Australia some 600–700 generations ago. and spread rapidly over a wide geographical range. Genetic variation for 15 microsatellite loci in each of nine populations in eastern Australia was used to estimate the size of the bottleneck. and to determine if any of these microsatellites marked genomic regions subject to recent selection.

In this work. we analyzed the population frequencies of 1.615 Transposable Element (TE) insertions annotated in the reference genome of Drosophila melanogaster. in 91 samples from 60 worldwide natural populations. We identified a set of 300 polymorphic TEs that are present at high population frequencies. and located in genomic regions with high recombination rate. where the efficiency of natural selection is high. The age and the length of these 300 TEs are consistent with relatively young and long insertions reaching high frequencies due to the action of positive selection.

Our knowledge of how these inversions originate is still very limited. although a prevailing view is that they are facilitated by ectopic recombination events between inverted repetitive sequences. The availability of genome sequences of related species now allows us to study in detail the mechanisms that generate interspecific inversions. We have analyzed the breakpoint regions of the 29 inversions that differentiate the chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster and two closely related species.

Experimental and computational analysis revealed that the breakpoint regions of 59% of the inversions (17/29) are associated with inverted duplications of genes or other nonrepetitive sequences. In only two cases do we find evidence for inverted repetitive sequences in inversion breakpoints. We propose that the presence of inverted duplications associated with inversion breakpoint regions is the result of staggered breaks. either isochromatid or chromatid. and that this. rather than ectopic exchange between inverted repetitive sequences. is the prevalent mechanism for the generation of inversions in the melanogaster species group.

Dordrecht, Sdic is a new gene that evolved recently in the lineage of Drosophila melanogaster. It was formed from a duplication and fusion of the gene AnnX. which encodes annexin X. and Cdic. which encodes the intermediate polypeptide chain of the cytoplasmic dynein. The fusion joins AnnX exon 4 with Cdic intron 3. which brings together three putative promoter elements for testes- specific expression of Sdic: the distal conserved element (DCE) and testesspecific element (TSE) are derived from AnnX. and the proximal conserved element (PCE) from Cdic intron 3. Sdic transcription initiates within the PCE. and translation is initiated within the sequence derived from Cdic intron 3. continuing through a 10 base pair insertion that creates a new splice donor site that enables the new coding sequence derived from intron 3 to be joined with the coding sequence of Cdic exon 4.

We find that regions of conserved gene order across the genus Drosophila are larger if they harbor genes bound by B-type lamin (Lam) and Suppressor of Under-Replication (SUUR). two proteins located at the nuclear periphery. Low recombination rates and coexpression of genes in regions of conserved gene order do not explain the lower probability of disruption in these regions by genome rearrangements. Instead. we find a significant colocalization between evolutionarily stable genomic regions associated with Lam and sequences thought to regulate local gene expression. which have the potential to impose constraints on genome rearrangement.

Most studies have focused on the buzzatii species complex. a monophyletic set of 12 species which inhabit the deserts of South America and the West Indies. A statistical analysis of the length and breakpoint distribution of the 86 paracentric inversions observed in this complex has shown that inversion length is a selected trait. Rare inversions are usually small while evolutionary successful inversions. fixed and polymorphic. are predominantly of medium size. There is also a negative correlation between length and number of inversions per species. Finally. the distribution of inversion breakpoints along chromosome 2 is non-random. with chromosomal regions which accumulate up to 8 breakpoints (putative ""hot spots""). Comparative gene mapping has also been used to investigate the molecular organization and evolution of chromosomes. Using in situ hybridization. 26 genes have been precisely located on the salivary gland chromosomes of D. repleta and D. buzzatii; another nine have been tentatively identified. The results are fully consistent with the currently accepted chromosomal homologies between D. repleta and D. melanogaster. and no evidence for reciprocal translocations or pericentric inversions has been found.

A common interpretation is that gene order conservation might reflect the existence of functional constraints that are important for organismal performance. Alteration of the integrity of genomic regions. and therefore of those constraints. would result in detrimental effects. This notion seems especially plausible in those genomes that can easily accommodate gene reshuffling via chromosomal inversions since genomic regions free of constraints are likely to have been disrupted in one or more lineages. Nevertheless. no empirical test has been performed to this notion. Here. we disrupt one of the largest conserved genomic regions of the Drosophila genome by chromosome engineering and examine the phenotypic consequences derived from such disruption. The targeted region exhibits multiple patterns of functional enrichment suggestive of the presence of constraints. The carriers of the disrupted collinear block show no defects in their viability. fertility. and parameters of general homeostasis. although their odorant perception is altered. This change in odorant perception does not correlate with modifications of the level of expression and sex bias of the genes within the genomic region disrupted. Our results indicate that even in highly rearranged genomes. like those of Diptera. unusually high levels of gene order conservation cannot be systematically attributed to functional constraints. which raises the possibility that other mechanisms can be in place and therefore the underpinnings of the maintenance of gene organization might be more diverse than previously …,True,_OtwyTsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,13,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002475,14152629509598439770,/scholar?cites=14152629509598439770,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002475,0,0,0

However. the influence of genomic context on the insertion preference of retrogenes remains poorly understood.

Assays of differences in sperm competitive ability between males. and interactions between females and males. have made it possible to infer some of the main mechanism of sperm competition. Nevertheless. classical genetic approaches have encountered difficulties in identifying loci influencing sperm competitiveness while functional and comparative genomic methodologies. as well as genetic variant association studies. have uncovered some interesting candidate genes. We highlight how the systematic implementation of approaches that incorporate gene perturbation assays in experimental competitive settings. together with the monitoring of progeny output or sperm features and behavior. has allowed the identification of genes unambiguously linked to sperm competitiveness.

However. in Drosophila and other Dipterans. where inversions are abundant both as intraspecific polymorphisms and interspecific fixed differences. the evidence for a role of TEs is scarce. Previous work revealed that the transposon Galileo was involved in the generation of two polymorphic inversions of Drosophila buzzatii.  Methodology/Principal Findings To assess the impact of TEs in Drosophila chromosomal evolution and shed light on the mechanism involved. we isolated and sequenced the two breakpoints of another widespread polymorphic inversion from D. buzzatii. 2z3. In the non inverted chromosome. the 2z3 distal breakpoint was located between genes CG2046 and CG10326 whereas the proximal breakpoint lies between two novel genes that we have named Dlh and Mdp. In the inverted chromosome. the analysis of the breakpoint sequences revealed relatively large insertions (2.870-bp and 4.786-bp long) including two copies of the transposon Galileo (subfamily Newton). one at each breakpoint. plus several other TEs.

Dias and Marta Svartman and Alejandra Delprat and Alfredo Ruiz and Gustavo C.S. Kuhn,,Genome Biology and Evolution,doi: 10.1093/gbe/evu108,,,Transposable elements (TEs) and satellite DNAs (satDNAs) are abundant components of most eukaryotic genomes studied so far and their impact on evolution has been the focus of several studies. A number of studies linked TEs with satDNAs. but the nature of their evolutionary relationships remains unclear. During in silico analyses of the Drosophila virilis assembled genome. we found a novel DNA transposon we named Tetris based on its modular structure and diversity of rearranged forms. We aimed to characterize Tetris and investigate its role in generating satDNAs. Data mining and sequence analysis showed that Tetris is apparently nonautonomous. with a structure similar to foldback elements. and present in D. virilis and D. americana.

Transposable elements (TEs). being repetitive sequences. are often misassembled. especially in the genomes sequenced with short reads. Consequently. the mobile fraction of many of the new genomes has not been analyzed in detail or compared with that of other genomes sequenced with different methods. which could shed light into the understanding of genome and TE evolution. Here we compare the TE content of three genomes: D. buzzatii st-1. j-19. and D. mojavensis. We have sequenced a new D. buzzatii genome (j-19) that complements the D. buzzatii reference genome (st-1) already published. and compared their TE contents with that of D. mojavensis. We found an underestimation of TE sequences in Drosophila genus NGS-genomes when compared to Sanger-genomes. To be able to compare genomes sequenced with different technologies. we developed a coverage-based method and applied it to the D. buzzatii st-1 and j-19 genome. Between 10.85 and 11.16 % of the D. buzzatii st-1 genome is made up of TEs. between 7 and 7.5 % of D. buzzatii j-19 genome. while TEs represent 15.35 % of the D. mojavensis genome. Helitrons are the most abundant order in the three genomes. TEs in D. buzzatii are less abundant than in D. mojavensis. as expected according to the genome size and TE content positive correlation.

Thirteen of these inversions occurred in the D. mojavensis lineage: twelve are fixed and one of them is a polymorphic inversion previously described in populations from Sonora and Baja California. México. We previously investigated the breakpoints of chromosome 2 inversions fixed in D. mojavensis. Here we characterized the breakpoint regions of the five inversions found in chromosome 3 in order to infer the molecular mechanism that generated each inversion and its putative functional consequences.

1113978,The transposon Galileo generates natural chromosomal inversions in Drosophila by ectopic recombination,2009,Alejandra Delprat and Bàrbara Negre and Marta Puig and Alfredo Ruiz,4,PloS one,11,e7883,Public Library of Science,Background Transposable elements (TEs) are responsible for the generation of chromosomal inversions in several groups of organisms. However. in Drosophila and other Dipterans. where inversions are abundant both as intraspecific polymorphisms and interspecific fixed differences. the evidence for a role of TEs is scarce. Previous work revealed that the transposon Galileo was involved in the generation of two polymorphic inversions of Drosophila buzzatii.  Methodology/Principal Findings To assess the impact of TEs in Drosophila chromosomal evolution and shed light on the mechanism involved. we isolated and sequenced the two breakpoints of another widespread polymorphic inversion from D. buzzatii. 2z3. In the non inverted chromosome. the 2z3 distal breakpoint was located between genes CG2046 and CG10326 whereas the proximal breakpoint lies between two novel genes that we have named Dlh and Mdp. In the inverted chromosome. the analysis of the breakpoint sequences revealed relatively large insertions (2.870-bp and 4.786-bp long) including two copies of the transposon Galileo (subfamily Newton). one at each breakpoint. plus several other TEs. The two Galileo copies: (i) are inserted in opposite orientation; (ii) present exchanged target site duplications; and (iii) are both chimeric.  Conclusions/Significance Our observations provide the best evidence gathered so far for the role of TEs in the generation of Drosophila inversions.

However. inversions have been related to phenotypic changes and adaptation in multiple species. In this review. we summarize the evidences of the functional impact of inversions in the human genome. First. given that inversions have been shown to inhibit recombination in heterokaryotes. chromosomes displaying different orientation are expected to evolve independently and this may lead to distinct gene-expression patterns.

Inversions. however. are poorly characterized and more difficult to study. especially those mediated by inverted repeats or segmental duplications. Here. we describe the results of a simple and fast inverse PCR (iPCR) protocol for high-throughput genotyping of a wide variety of inversions using a small amount of DNA. In particular. we analyzed 22 inversions predicted in humans ranging from 5.1 kb to 226 kb and mediated by inverted repeat sequences of 1.6–24 kb.

Global inversion minor allele frequency varied between 1% and 49% and inversion genotypes were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. By analyzing the nucleotide variation and the haplotypes in these regions. we found that only four inversions have linked tag-SNPs and that in many cases there are multiple shared SNPs between standard and inverted chromosomes. suggesting an unexpected high degree of inversion recurrence during human evolution. iPCR was also used to check 16 of these inversions in four chimpanzees and two gorillas. and 10 showed both orientations either within or between species. providing additional support for their multiple origin.

A common hypothesis is that the selective value of inversions stems in part from their effects on nearby genes. although evidence of this in natural populations is almost nonexistent. Here we present a global analysis of a new 415-kb polymorphic inversion that is among the longest ones found in humans and is the first with clear position effects. This inversion is located in chromosome 19 and has been generated by non-homologous end joining between blocks of transposable elements with low identity. PCR genotyping in 541 individuals from eight different human populations allowed the detection of tag SNPs and inversion genotyping in multiple populations worldwide. showing that the inverted allele is mainly found in East Asia with an average frequency of 4.7%. Interestingly. one of the breakpoints disrupts the transcription factor gene ZNF257. causing a significant reduction in the total expression level of this gene in lymphoblastoid cell lines. RNA-Seq analysis of the effects of this expression change in standard homozygotes and inversion heterozygotes revealed distinct expression patterns that were validated by quantitative RT-PCR.

Although the most characteristic feature of Galileo is the long internally-repetitive terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). which resemble the Drosophila Foldback element. its transposase-coding sequence has led to its classification as a member of the P-element superfamily (Class II. subclass 1. TIR order). Furthermore. Galileo has a wide distribution in the genus Drosophila. since it has been found in 6 of the 12 Drosophila sequenced genomes. Among these species. D. mojavensis. the one closest to D. buzzatii. presented the highest diversity in sequence and structure of Galileo elements. In the present work. we carried out a thorough search and annotation of all the Galileo copies present in the D. mojavensis sequenced genome.

Finally. we have explored the structural and length variation of the Galileo copies that point out the relatively frequent rearrangements within and between Galileo elements. Different mechanisms responsible for these rearrangements are discussed. Although Galileo is a transposable element with an ancient history in the D. mojavensis genome. our data indicate a recent transpositional activity.

Therefore. our results indicate that the genome is more dynamic than previously thought and that human inversions have important functional and evolutionary consequences. making possible to determine for the first time their contribution to complex traits.,True,jykQkjQAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/501981v1.abstract,14461390571402495659,/scholar?cites=14461390571402495659,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/12/19/501981.full.pdf,0,0,0

Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced. the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20.000-23.000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution. while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example. the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements. both non-coding and coding. Notably. many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes.

(2) Crossing over overwhelms gene conversion as a cause of gene flux in large inversions. while conversion becomes relatively significant in short inversions and in regions around the breakpoints.

This type of gene duplication. as any other. could be a source of new genes and functions. Using whole genome sequence data for 12 Drosophila species. we dated the origin of 94 retroposition events that gave rise to candidate functional genes in D. melanogaster. Based on this analysis. we infer that functional retrogenes have emerged at a fairly constant rate of 0.5 genes per million years per lineage over the last approximately 63 million years of Drosophila evolution. The number of functional retrogenes and the rate at which they are recruited in the D. melanogaster lineage are of the same order of magnitude as those estimated in the human lineage. despite the higher deletion bias in the Drosophila genome. However. unlike primates. the rate of retroposition in Drosophila seems to be fairly constant and no burst of retroposition can be inferred from our analyses. In addition. our data also support an important role for retrogenes as a source of lineage-specific male functions. in agreement with previous hypotheses. Finally. we identified three cases of functional retrogenes in D. melanogaster that have been independently retroposed and recruited in parallel as new genes in other Drosophila lineages.

1114011,Evolutionary origin of regulatory regions of retrogenes in Drosophila,2008,Yongsheng Bai and Claudio Casola and Esther Betrán,9,BMC genomics,1,1-9,BioMed Central,Retrogenes are processed copies of other genes. This duplication mechanism produces a copy of the parental gene that should not contain introns. and usually does not contain cis-regulatory regions. Here. we computationally address the evolutionary origin of promoter and other cis-regulatory regions in retrogenes using a total of 94 Drosophila retroposition events we recently identified. Previous tissue expression data has revealed that a large fraction of these retrogenes are specifically and/or highly expressed in adult testes of Drosophila. In this work. we infer that retrogenes do not generally carry regulatory regions from aberrant upstream or normal transcripts of their parental genes. and that expression patterns of neighboring genes are not consistently shared by retrogenes. Additionally. transposable elements do not appear to substantially provide regulatory regions to retrogenes. Interestingly. we find that there is an excess of retrogenes in male testis neighborhoods that is not explained by insertional biases of the retroelement machinery used for retroposition. We conclude that retrogenes' regulatory regions mostly do not represent a random set of existing regulatory regions. On the contrary. our conclusion is that selection is likely to have played an important role in the persistence of autosomal testis biased retrogenes. Selection in favor of retrogenes inserted in male testis neighborhoods and at the sequence level to produce testis expression is postulated to have occurred.,True,4W1TBngAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,40,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-9-241,12140897202670430604,/scholar?cites=12140897202670430604,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-9-241,0,0,0
1114012,Conflict between translation initiation and elongation in vertebrate mitochondrial genomes,2007,Xuhua Xia and Huang Huang and Malisa Carullo and Esther Betrán and Etsuko N Moriyama,2,PLoS One,2,e227,Public Library of Science,The strand-biased mutation spectrum in vertebrate mitochondrial genomes results in an AC-rich L-strand and a GT-rich H-strand. Because the L-strand is the sense strand of 12 protein-coding genes out of the 13. the third codon position is overall strongly AC-biased. The wobble site of the anticodon of the 22 mitochondrial tRNAs is either U or G to pair with the most abundant synonymous codon. with only one exception. The wobble site of Met-tRNA is C instead of U. forming the Watson-Crick match with AUG instead of AUA. the latter being much more frequent than the former. This has been attributed to a compromise between translation initiation and elongation; i.e.. AUG is not only a methionine codon. but also an initiation codon. and an anticodon matching AUG will increase the initiation rate. However. such an anticodon would impose selection against the use of AUA codons because AUA needs to be wobble-translated. According to this translation conflict hypothesis. AUA should be used relatively less frequently compared to UUA in the UUR codon family. A comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial genomes from a variety of vertebrate species revealed a general deficiency of AUA codons relative to UUA codons. In contrast. urochordate mitochondrial genomes with two tRNAMet genes with CAU and UAU anticodons exhibit increased AUA codon usage. Furthermore. six bivalve mitochondrial genomes with both of their tRNA-Met genes with a CAU anticodon have reduced AUA usage relative to three other bivalve mitochondrial genomes with one of their two tRNA-Met genes having a CAU anticodon and the other having a UAU anticodon …,True,4W1TBngAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,38,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000227,750601744827032448,/scholar?cites=750601744827032448,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000227,0,0,0

Therefore. when a new duplicate gene arises. its location may be critical in determining its fate. Our recent work in humans. mouse. and Drosophila provided a test by studying the patterns of duplication in sex chromosome evolution. We revealed a bias in the generation and recruitment of new gene copies involving the X chromosome that has been shaped largely by selection for male germline functions. The gene movement patterns we observed reflect an ongoing process as some of the new genes are very young while others were present before the divergence of humans and mouse. This suggests a continuing redistribution of male-related genes to achieve a more efficient allocation of male functions.

Gene retroposition is a mechanism of gene duplication whereby a gene’s transcript is used as a template to generate retroposed gene copies. or retrocopies. Intriguingly. the formation of retrocopies depends upon the enzymatic machinery encoded by retrotransposable elements. genomic parasites occurring in the majority of eukaryotes.

1114016,Why chromosome palindromes?,2012,Esther Betrán and Jeffery P Demuth and Anna Williford,2012,International journal of evolutionary biology,,,Hindawi,We look at sex-limited chromosome (Y or W) evolution with particular emphasis on the importance of palindromes. Y chromosome palindromes consist of inverted duplicates that allow for local recombination in an otherwise nonrecombining chromosome. Since palindromes enable intrachromosomal gene conversion that can help eliminate deleterious mutations. they are often highlighted as mechanisms to protect against Y degeneration.  However. the adaptive significance of recombination resides in its ability to decouple the evolutionary fates of linked mutations. leading to both a decrease in degeneration rate and an increase in adaptation rate. Our paper emphasizes the latter. that palindromes may exist to accelerate adaptation by increasing the potential targets and fixation rates of incoming beneficial mutations. This hypothesis helps reconcile two enigmatic features of the “palindromes as protectors” view: (1) genes that are not located in palindromes have been retained under purifying selection for tens of millions of years. and (2) under models that only consider deleterious mutations. gene conversion benefits duplicate gene maintenance but not initial fixation. We conclude by looking at ways to test the hypothesis that palindromes enhance the rate of adaptive evolution of Y-linked genes and whether this effect can be extended to palindromes on other chromosomes.,True,4W1TBngAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,32,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/207958.pdf,9882533619105052824,/scholar?cites=9882533619105052824,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/207958.pdf,0,0,0

However. in Drosophila and other Dipterans. where inversions are abundant both as intraspecific polymorphisms and interspecific fixed differences. the evidence for a role of TEs is scarce. Previous work revealed that the transposon Galileo was involved in the generation of two polymorphic inversions of Drosophila buzzatii.  Methodology/Principal Findings To assess the impact of TEs in Drosophila chromosomal evolution and shed light on the mechanism involved. we isolated and sequenced the two breakpoints of another widespread polymorphic inversion from D. buzzatii. 2z3. In the non inverted chromosome. the 2z3 distal breakpoint was located between genes CG2046 and CG10326 whereas the proximal breakpoint lies between two novel genes that we have named Dlh and Mdp. In the inverted chromosome. the analysis of the breakpoint sequences revealed relatively large insertions (2.870-bp and 4.786-bp long) including two copies of the transposon Galileo (subfamily Newton). one at each breakpoint. plus several other TEs. The two Galileo copies: (i) are inserted in opposite orientation; (ii) present exchanged target site duplications; and (iii) are both chimeric.  Conclusions/Significance Our observations provide the best evidence gathered so far for the role of TEs in the generation of Drosophila inversions.

Our results show that the evolutionary rate of Hox genes is higher than that of non-Hox genes when both amino acid differences and indels are taken into account: 43.39% of the amino acid sequence is altered in Hox genes. versus 30.97% in non-Hox genes and 64.73% in Hox-derived genes. Microsatellites scattered along the coding sequence of Hox genes explain partially. but not fully. their fast sequence evolution. Conclusion These results show that Hox genes have a higher evolutionary dynamics than other developmental genes. and emphasize the need to take into account indels in addition to nucleotide substitutions in order to accurately estimate evolutionary rates.,True,cdY0z8kAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/238056,,,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/238056/1471-2148-6-106.pdf?sequence=7,0,0,0

We model the effects of the genetic barrier to gene flow caused by a chromosomal rearrangement on the rate of accumulation of postzygotic isolation genes in parapatry. We find that. if reproductive isolation is produced by the accumulation in parapatry of sets of alleles compatible within but incompatible across species. chromosomal rearrangements are far more likely to favor it than classical genetic barriers without chromosomal changes. New evidence of the role of chromosomal rearrangements in parapatric speciation suggests that postzygotic isolation is often due to the accumulation of such incompatibilities.

However. the first chromosomal speciation models were unsatisfactory and data available to test them was scarce. Recently. large amounts of data have become available and new theoretical models have been developed explaining how rearrangements facilitate speciation in the face of gene flow. Here. we re-examine theoretical predictions and revisit different sources of data. Although rearrangements are often associated with increased levels of divergence. unequivocal demonstration that their role in suppressing recombination results in speciation is often lacking.

We analyzed the high-coverage whole genomes of 75 wild-born chimpanzees and bonobos from 10 countries in Africa. We found that chimpanzee population substructure makes genetic information a good predictor of geographic origin at country and regional scales. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that gene flow occurred from bonobos into the ancestors of central and eastern chimpanzees between 200.000 and 550.000 years ago. probably with subsequent spread into Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees. Together with another. possibly more recent contact (after 200.000 years ago). bonobos contributed less than 1% to the central chimpanzee genomes.

1114049,High trans-ethnic replicability of GWAS results implies common causal variants,2013,Urko M Marigorta and Arcadi Navarro,9,PLoS Genet,6,e1003566,Public Library of Science,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have detected many disease associations. However. the reported variants tend to explain small fractions of risk. and there are doubts about issues such as the portability of findings over different ethnic groups or the relative roles of rare versus common variants in the genetic architecture of complex disease. Studying the degree of sharing of disease-associated variants across populations can help in solving these issues. We present a comprehensive survey of GWAS replicability across 28 diseases. Most loci and SNPs discovered in Europeans for these conditions have been extensively replicated using peoples of European and East Asian ancestry. while the replication with individuals of African ancestry is much less common. We found a strong and significant correlation of Odds Ratios across Europeans and East Asians. indicating that underlying causal variants are common and shared between the two ancestries. Moreover. SNPs that failed to replicate in East Asians map into genomic regions where Linkage Disequilibrium patterns differ significantly between populations. Finally. we observed that GWAS with larger sample sizes have detected variants with weaker effects rather than with lower frequencies. Our results indicate that most GWAS results are due to common variants. In addition. the sharing of disease alleles and the high correlation in their effect sizes suggest that most of the underlying causal variants are shared between Europeans and East Asians and that they tend to map close to the associated marker SNPs.,True,etwqWWoAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,164,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003566,162050653656330387,/scholar?cites=162050653656330387,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003566,0,0,0

Our analysis identified ∼800 genes with significantly altered methylation patterns among the great apes. including ∼170 genes with a methylation pattern unique to human. Some of these are known to be involved in developmental and neurological features. suggesting that epigenetic changes have been frequent during recent human and primate evolution.

We find that the movement of Muller's ratchet can be associated with a considerable reduction in genetic diversity below classical neutral expectation. The extent to which variability is reduced is a function of the deleterious mutation rate. the fitness effects of the mutations. and the population size. Approximate analytical expressions for the expected genetic diversity are compared with simulation results under two different models of deleterious mutations: a model where all deleterious mutations have equal effects and a model where there are two classes of deleterious mutations.

In this context. wing morphology provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the factors that may induce changes during development. In this work. we investigated phenotypic plasticity and developmental instability of wing morphology in flies on the cactophilic Drosophila buzzatii and Drosophila koepferae raised on alternative breeding substrates.

The time to reach the age of reproduction is a complex life history trait commonly known as developmental time. In particular. in holometabolous insects that occupy ephemeral habitats. like fruit flies. the impact of developmental time on fitness is further exaggerated. The present work is one of the first systematic studies of the genetic basis of developmental time. in which we also evaluate the impact of environmental variation on the expression of the trait. We analyzed 179 co-isogenic single P[GT1]-element insertion lines of Drosophila melanogaster to identify novel genes affecting developmental time in flies reared at 25°C. Sixty percent of the lines showed a heterochronic phenotype. suggesting that a large number of genes affect this trait. Mutant lines for the genes Merlin and Karl showed the most extreme phenotypes exhibiting a developmental time reduction and increase. respectively. of over 2 days and 4 days relative to the control (a co-isogenic P-element insertion free line). In addition. a subset of 42 lines selected at random from the initial set of 179 lines was screened at 17°C. Interestingly. the gene-by-environment interaction accounted for 52% of total phenotypic variance. Plastic reaction norms were found for a large number of developmental time candidate genes.

Highly conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) have proven to be reliable indicators of functionally constrained sequences such as cis-regulatory elements and noncoding RNA genes. However. CNSs may arise from nonselective evolutionary processes such as genomic regions with extremely low mutation rates known as mutation “cold spots.” Here we combine comparative genomic data from recently completed insect genome projects with population genetic data in Drosophila melanogaster to test predictions of the mutational cold spot model of CNS evolution in the genus Drosophila. We find that point mutations in intronic and intergenic CNSs exhibit a significant reduction in levels of divergence relative to levels of polymorphism. as well as a …,True,jjNng6kAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,75,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/24/10/2222/1070290,15396814996849787104,/scholar?cites=15396814996849787104,,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/24/10/2222/1070290,0,0,0

So far. only a handful of inversions have been studied in detail in humans and current knowledge about their possible functional effects is still limited. However. inversions have been related to phenotypic changes and adaptation in multiple species. In this review. we summarize the evidences of the functional impact of inversions in the human genome. First. given that inversions have been shown to inhibit recombination in heterokaryotes. chromosomes displaying different orientation are expected to evolve independently and this may lead to distinct gene-expression patterns. Second. inversions have a role as disease-causing mutations both by directly affecting gene structure or regulation in different ways. and by predisposing to …,True,jjNng6kAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,73,https://academic.oup.com/bfg/article-abstract/14/5/369/184344,3738466243728846418,/scholar?cites=3738466243728846418,,https://academic.oup.com/bfg/article/14/5/369/184344,0,0,0

The mechanistic explanation for this colinearity has been elusive. and it may well be that a single and universal cause does not exist. The Hox-gene complex (HOM-C) has been rearranged differently in several Drosophila species. producing a striking diversity of Hox gene organizations.

The results show evidence of selection acting through pupal viability. longevity (adult viability) and fecundity on the second chromosome polymorphism. and through pupal viability and virility on the fourth chromosome polymorphism.Changes in chromosomal inversion frequencies throughout the life‐cycle suggested an endocyclic pattern of directional selection. which at first seems to be the only detectable mechanism responsible for the maintenance of the polymorphism.

Genetic dissection of this reproductive barrier has revealed that the number of responsible factors is very high and that these factors are frequently engaged in complex epistatic interactions.

However. because of their quick divergence. the evolutionary origin of a given satDNA family can rarely be determined. Herein we took advantage of available primate sequenced genomes to determine the origin of the CapA satDNA (approx. 1500 bp long monomers). first described in the tufted capuchin monkey Sapajus apella. We show that CapA is an abundant satDNA in Platyrrhini. whereas in the genomes of most eutherian mammals. including humans. this sequence is present only as a single copy located within a large intron of the NOS1AP (nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein) gene.

Among them. the genus Akodon has been extensively analyzed with classical and molecular cytogenetics. which allowed the identification of a large number of intra- and interspecific chromosomal variation due to Robertsonian rearrangements. pericentric inversions. and heterochromatin additions/deletions. In order to shed some light on the cause of these rearrangements. we comparatively analyzed the karyotypes of three Akodontini species. Akodon cursor (2n = 14. FN = 19). A. montensis (2n = 24. FN = 42). and Necromys lasiurus (2n = 34. FN = 34). after GTG- and CBG-banding. The karyotypes differed by Robertsonian rearrangements. pericentric inversions. centromere repositioning. and heterochromatin variation. Genome comparisons were performed through interspecific fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with total genomic DNAs of each species as probes (GISH). Our results revealed considerable conservation of the euchromatic portions among the three karyotypes suggesting that they mostly differ in their heterochromatic regions. FISH was also performed to assess the distribution of telomeric sequences. long and short interspersed repetitive elements (LINE-1 and B1 SINE) and of the endogenous retrovirus mysTR in the genomes of the three species.

1114181,Two‐stage designs versus E uropean scaled average designs in bioequivalence studies for highly variable drugs: Which to choose?,2017,Eduard Molins and Erik Cobo and Jordi Ocaña,36,Statistics in medicine,30,4777-4788,,The usual approach to determine bioequivalence for highly variable drugs is scaled average bioequivalence. which is based on expanding the limits as a function of the within‐subject variability in the reference formulation. This requires separately estimating this variability and thus using replicated or semireplicated crossover designs. On the other hand. regulations also allow using common 2 × 2 crossover designs based on two‐stage adaptive approaches with sample size reestimation at an interim analysis. The choice between scaled or two‐stage designs is crucial and must be fully described in the protocol. Using Monte Carlo simulations. we show that both methodologies achieve comparable statistical power. though the scaled method usually requires less sample size. but at the expense of each subject being exposed more times to the treatments.

Ocana. and Alonso. 1975. Theoretical and Applied Genetics 45. 231-241) is studied and its asymptotic behaviour is established. For those cases where closed solutions cannot be obtained. alternatives based on the bootstrap have been considered. The bootstrap allows us to approximate the sampling distribution of the distance and to estimate the standard error in any situation. It is also used to construct a test of significance. Besides the theoretical study. some simulations have been performed to validate and compare the results obtained. They suggest that the bootstrap and the classical theory are equally satisfactory in certain situations. whereas the bootstrap works well in situations where classical theory fails.,True,mGOdFNYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,7,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2533255,4479612213318405844,/scholar?cites=4479612213318405844,,,0,0,0

Using a large data base of eukaryotic intron-containing genes. we have found that there are correlations between intron phases leading to an excess of symmetric exons and symmetric exon sets. We interpret these excesses as manifestations of exon shuffling and make a conservative estimate that at least 19% of the exons in the data base were involved in exon shuffling. suggesting an important role for exon shuffling in evolution. Furthermore. these excesses of symmetric exons appear also in those regions of eukaryotic genes that are homologous to prokaryotic genes: the ancient conserved regions.

The breakpoints of the cosmopolitan inversion 2j of D. buzzatii were cloned and sequenced. Both breakpoints contain large insertions corresponding to a transposable element. It appears that the two pairs of target site duplications generated upon insertion were exchanged during the inversion event. and that the inversion arose by ectopic recombination between two copies of the transposon that were in opposite orientations.

Both these predictions are supported by the data. with considerable statistical force (P values < 0.0001). Intron positions correlate to modules of diameters around 21. 27. and 33 Å. and this correlation is due to phase zero introns.

In particular. genes expressed in testis have been observed to frequently relocate from the X chromosome to the autosomes. The inactivation of X-linked genes during male meiosis (i.e.. meiotic sex chromosome inactivation—MSCI) was first proposed to explain male sterility caused by X-autosomal translocation in Drosophila. and more recently it was suggested that MSCI might provide the conditions under which selection would favor the accumulation of testis-expressed genes on autosomes. In order to investigate the impact of MSCI on Drosophila testis-expressed genes. we performed a global gene expression analysis of the three major phases of D. melanogaster spermatogenesis: mitosis. meiosis. and post-meiosis. First. we found evidence supporting the existence of MSCI by comparing the expression levels of X- and autosome-linked genes. finding the former to be significantly reduced in meiosis. Second. we observed that the paucity of X-linked testis-expressed genes was restricted to those genes highly expressed in meiosis. Third. we found that autosomal genes relocated through retroposition from the X chromosome were more often highly expressed in meiosis in contrast to their X-linked parents.

How new RNA genes originated and whether this process is controlled by similar evolutionary mechanisms for the origin of protein-coding genes remains unclear. A young chimeric RNA gene that we term sphinx (spx) provides the first insight into the early stage of evolution of RNA genes. spx originated as an insertion of a retroposed sequence of the ATP synthase chain F gene at the cytological region 60DB since the divergence of Drosophila melanogaster from its sibling species 2–3 million years ago. This retrosequence. which is located at 102F on the fourth chromosome. recruited a nearby exon and intron. thereby evolving a chimeric gene structure.

Two alternative theories. the ‘exon theory of genes’ and the ‘insertional theory of introns’. debate the presence or absence of introns in primordial genes.

One example is the statistical analysis of intron phases — the position of introns within or between codons. This analysis detected a significant signal of exon shuffling in the DNA sequence database containing both ancient and modern exon sequences: intron phase correlations. that is. the association together within genes of introns of the same phase.

Although the most characteristic feature of Galileo is the long internally-repetitive terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). which resemble the Drosophila Foldback element. its transposase-coding sequence has led to its classification as a member of the P-element superfamily (Class II. subclass 1. TIR order). Furthermore. Galileo has a wide distribution in the genus Drosophila. since it has been found in 6 of the 12 Drosophila sequenced genomes. Among these species. D. mojavensis. the one closest to D. buzzatii. presented the highest diversity in sequence and structure of Galileo elements. In the present work. we carried out a thorough search and annotation of all the Galileo copies present in the D. mojavensis sequenced genome.

Finally. we have explored the structural and length variation of the Galileo copies that point out the relatively frequent rearrangements within and between Galileo elements. Different mechanisms responsible for these rearrangements are discussed. Although Galileo is a transposable element with an ancient history in the D. mojavensis genome. our data indicate a recent transpositional activity. Furthermore. the dynamism in sequence and structure. mainly affecting the TIRs. suggests an active exchange of sequences among the copies.

Since 1985. the “comparative method” has been revitalized by new analytical techniques that use phylogenetic information and by increased availability of phytogenies (often from molecular data sets). Because species descend from common ancestors in a hierarchical fashion. related species tend to resemble each other (elephants look like elephants); therefore. cross-species data sets generally do not comprise independent and identically distributed data points.

Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage. there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called ‘early warning signals’. and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However. while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding. opinions on their practical use differ widely. and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here. we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide. our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.,True,VjG9x8IAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,538,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041010,3043381873445635048,/scholar?cites=3043381873445635048,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041010,0,0,0

Instead of an equilibrium point. the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution. which is characterized by means. variances. and other statistical moments. Here. we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time‐series data using first‐order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability.

Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate. mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here. we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective. by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism.

The methods are based on an evolutionary model of binary traits in which trait values switch between 0 and 1 as species evolve up a phylogenetic tree. The more frequently the trait values switch (i.e.. the higher the rate of evolution). the more rapidly correlations between trait values for phylogenetically related species break down. Therefore. the statistical methods also give a way to estimate the phylogenetic signal of binary traits.

However. the genomic copy number of the 16S gene varies greatly – from one in many species to up to 15 in some bacteria and to hundreds in some microbial eukaryotes. As a result of this variation the relative abundance of 16S genes in environmental samples can be attributed both to variation in the relative abundance of different organisms. and to variation in genomic 16S copy number among those organisms. Despite this fact. many studies assume that the abundance of 16S gene sequences is a surrogate measure of the relative abundance of the organisms containing those sequences. Here we present a method that uses data on sequences and genomic copy number of 16S genes along with phylogenetic placement and ancestral state estimation to estimate organismal abundances from environmental DNA sequence data. We use theory and simulations to demonstrate that 16S genomic copy number can be accurately estimated from the short reads typically obtained from high-throughput environmental sequencing of the 16S gene. and that organismal abundances in microbial communities are more strongly correlated with estimated abundances obtained from our method than with gene abundances. We re-analyze several published empirical data sets and demonstrate that the use of gene abundance versus estimated organismal abundance can lead to different inferences about community diversity and structure and the identity of the …,True,_KkYNpIAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,386,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002743,18084883587828225966,/scholar?cites=18084883587828225966,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002743,0,0,0

Through identifying these dimensions and understanding their inter-relationships we gain insight into why particular trait combinations are favoured over others and into the implications of trait differences among species. Here we investigated relationships among several traits. and thus the strategy dimensions they represented. across 2134 woody species from seven Neotropical forests.Six traits were studied: specific leaf area (SLA). the average size of leaves. seed and fruit. typical maximum plant height. and wood density (WD).

However. some mid‐Cretaceous leaf floras have been interpreted as rain forest. Molecular divergence‐time estimates within the clade Malpighiales. which constitute a large percentage of species in the shaded. shrub. and small tree layer in tropical rain forests worldwide. provide new tests of these hypotheses. We estimate that all 28 major lineages (i.e.. traditionally recognized families) within this clade originated in tropical rain forest well before the Tertiary. mostly during the Albian and Cenomanian (112–94 Ma). Their rapid rise in the mid‐Cretaceous may have resulted from the origin of adaptations to survive and reproduce under a closed forest canopy.

We pose a general question: In the course of an evolutionary radiation. do traits related to within‐community niche differences (α niche) evolve before or after differentiation of macrohabitat affinity or climatic tolerances (β niche)? Here we introduce a new test to address this question. based on a modification of the method of independent contrasts. The divergence order test (DOT) is based on the average age of the nodes on a tree. weighted by the absolute magnitude of the contrast at each node for a particular trait.

Speciation of a sedentary species into two sedentary daughter species is more frequent than speciation of a migratory species into two migratory daughter species.

Here. we argue that phylogenomics stands to benefit by embracing the many heterogeneous genomic signals emerging from the first decade of large-scale phylogenetic analysis spawned by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Such signals include those most commonly encountered in phylogenomic datasets. such as incomplete lineage sorting. but also those reticulate processes emerging with greater frequency. such as recombination and introgression. Here we focus specifically on how phylogenetic methods can accommodate the heterogeneity incurred by such population genetic processes; we do not discuss phylogenetic methods that ignore such processes. such as concatenation or supermatrix approaches or supertrees. We suggest that methods of data acquisition and the types of markers used in phylogenomics will remain restricted until a posteriori methods of marker choice are made possible with routine whole-genome sequencing of taxa of interest. We discuss limitations and potential extensions of a model supporting innovation in phylogenomics today. the multispecies coalescent model (MSC). Macroevolutionary models that use phylogenies. such as character mapping. often ignore the heterogeneity on which building phylogenies increasingly rely and suggest that assimilating such heterogeneity is an important goal moving forward.

A wide range of models is already available for this type of analysis. and the field is still under active development. One of the most needed development concerns models that better account for the effect of within- and between-clade interspecific interactions on trait evolution. which can result from processes as diverse as competition. predation. parasitism. or mutualism. Here. we begin by developing a very general comparative phylogenetic framework for (multi)-trait evolution that can be applied to both ultrametric and nonultrametric trees.

A major question in rhizosphere research is how species in root microbiome communities interact with each other and their host. In the nutrient mutualism between host plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). competition often leads to certain species dominating host colonization. with the outcome being dependent on environmental conditions. In the past. it has been difficult to quantify the abundance of closely related species and track competitive interactions in different regions of the rhizosphere. specifically within and outside the host.

Many of these cases have been linked to anthropogenic environmental change. but the mechanisms leading from environmental change to species collapse. and the long‐term effects of hybridization on species pairs. remain poorly understood. We used an individual‐based stochastic simulation model to explore the conditions under which disturbances that weaken premating barriers to reproduction patterns between sympatric species might lead to increased hybridization and to species collapse.

The legume–rhizobia mutualism has become a model system for studying how plants control cheating partners. However. the generality and evolutionary origins of these control mechanisms are intensely debated. In this Opinion article. we argue that a novel system – the Parasponia–rhizobia mutualism – will significantly advance research in mutualism stability. Parasponia is the only non-legume lineage to have evolved a rhizobial symbiosis. which provides an evolutionary replicate to test how rhizobial exploitation is controlled. Evidence also suggests that this symbiosis is young.

However. they do not explain the counterintuitive preference of high elevation range in winter by the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti). We asked whether variation of sunshine along with elevations is the key driving force. To test this hypothesis. we conducted field surveys to demonstrate that there was a statistically significant pattern of high elevation use during winter. We then asked whether this pattern can be explained by certain environmental factors. namely temperature. sunshine duration and solar radiation. Finally. we concluded with a possible ecological mechanism for this pattern. In this study. we employed GIS technology to quantify solar radiation and sunshine duration across the monkey's range. Our results showed that: 1) R. bieti used the high altitude range between 4100–4400 m in winter although the yearly home range spanned from 3500–4500 m; 2) both solar radiation and sunshine duration increased with elevation while temperature decreased with elevation; 3) within the winter range. the use of range was significantly correlated with solar radiation and sunshine duration; 4) monkeys moved to the areas with high solar radiation and duration following a snowfall. where the snow melts faster and food is exposed earlier. We concluded that sunshine was the main factor that influences selection of high elevation habitat for R. bieti in winter.

Rubber plantation sites had the lowest species richness in our non-breeding habitat surveys and no species used rubber plantation sites as breeding habitat. The absence of breeding was likely not due to intrinsic properties of the rubber plantation pools. as our experiments indicated that rubber plantation pools were suitable for tadpole growth and development. Rather. the absence of breeding in the rubber plantation was likely due to a misalignment of breeding and non-breeding habitat preferences. Analyses of our breeding surveys showed that percent canopy cover over pools was the strongest environmental variable influencing breeding site selection. with species exhibiting preferences for pools under both high and low canopy cover. Although rubber plantation pools had high canopy cover. the only species that bred in high canopy cover sites used the rainforest for both non-breeding and breeding activities. completing their entire life cycle in the rainforest.

Because this context dependency arises from a mix of both quantitative and qualitative factors. standard ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling methods often complicate the representation of resource allocation strategies.

These threats often co‐occur. as developed areas are more prone to species invasion. However. few empirical studies have tested if both factors affect biodiversity in similar ways. Here we study the individual and combined effects of urban development and plant invasion on the composition of arthropod communities. We assessed 36 paired invaded and non‐invaded sample plots. invaded by the plant Antigonon leptopus. with half of these pairs located in natural and the other half in developed land‐use types on the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius. We used several taxonomic and functional variables to describe community composition and diversity.

While it is clear that land‐use change significantly impacts the taxonomic dimension of soil biodiversity. how the functional dimension responds to land‐use change is less well understood.2. This study examined how the transformation of primary forests into rubber tree monocultures impacts individual termite species and how this change is reflected in termite taxonomic and functional α‐diversity (within site) and β‐diversity (among sites).3. Overall. individual species responded strongly to land‐use change. whereby only 11 of the 27 species found were able to tolerate both habitats. These differences caused a 27% reduction in termite taxonomic richness and reduced taxonomic β‐diversity in rubber plantations compared with primary forests. The study also revealed that the forest conversion led to a shift in some termite species with smaller body size. shorter legs and smaller mandibular traits.

As a result. island biodiversity is characterized by high levels of endemism. Most native species on large and geographically isolated islands are found nowhere else in the world. The intrigue of unique island species spurred the development of island biogeography theory. which predicts how an island's geography influences the natural factors that determine the assemblage of species on it. Here we review how this theory not only explains the natural patterns of species diversity on islands. but also explains how this diversity shifted in the Anthropocene. where human factors overwhelm natural factors in influencing species distributions.,True,rYki1w4AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17625232856661156204&hl=en&oi=scholarr,17625232856661156204,/scholar?cites=17625232856661156204,,,0,0,0

1114371,Island Biogeography Revisited,2020,Matthew R Helmus and Jocelyn E Behm,,,,51-56,Elsevier,For centuries. naturalists have been intrigued by islands. Patterns in island biodiversity are the basis for fundamental theories in ecology such as island biogeography theory (IBT). Under this theory. the biodiversity of islands is a function of three processes: immigration. evolution and extinction. Immigration from source pools and subsequent evolution adds biodiversity to islands. Evolution allows immigrants to adapt to island habitats and evolve into new species. In contrast. extinction subtracts species. In a natural context. these three processes are a function of island area and isolation. Larger islands have more immigration. more evolution. and less extinction and thus more biodiversity than smaller islands. Isolated islands have more evolution. but less immigration and higher extinction resulting in lower biodiversity than proximate islands. Understanding how geography influences these three processes is the …,True,rYki1w4AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18432937909347853137&hl=en&oi=scholarr,18432937909347853137,/scholar?cites=18432937909347853137,,,0,0,0

Biological Diversity covers fundamental measurement issues such as sampling. re-examines familiar diversity metrics (including species richness. diversity statistics. and estimates of spatial and temporal turnover). discusses species abundance distributions and how best to fit them. explores species occurrence and the spatial structure of biodiversity. and investigates alternative approaches used to assess trait. phylogenetic. and genetic diversity. The final section of the book turns to a selection of contemporary challenges such as measuring microbial diversity. evaluating the impact of disturbance. assessing biodiversity in managed landscapes. measuring diversity in the imperfect fossil record. and using species density estimates in management and conservation.,True,jYQfwwkAAAAJ:5jwsdJSnGWIC,855,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7mwVDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:0lOZruoZ3FwJ:scholar.google.com&ots=OfEG268BMN&sig=yiEgEDodKI31EUNkfSYOHpbq4Os,6691251642108040146,/scholar?cites=6691251642108040146,,,0,0,0

We present a trait‐based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species’ trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species’ position along a gradient defined by community‐level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species’ trait values and the mean of co‐occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California. beta trait values for specific leaf area. leaf size. wood density and maximum height all covary strongly. reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values. on the other hand. are generally not significantly correlated. suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities.

Oxford University Press, Oxford",,194-207,,Biodiversity has been described as the ‘biology of numbers and difference’(Gaston 1996). Because species are different from one another. traditional metrics of biodiversity such as species richness or evenness increase when there are more species or when abundance is more equally apportioned among these species (see Chapters4 and 5). Not only are species different from one another. the magnitude of these differences varies tremendously depending on the set of species in question. Consider two hypothetical islands. each with only two species of vertebrate animals in equal abundance: two birds in one case and a bird plus a mammal in the other. Both islands have species richness= 2 (for vertebrates) and the same maximal value of species evenness. However. our intuition tells us that a bird plus a mammal represents more biodiversity than does two birds (Purvis & Hector 2000). Metrics of phylogenetic diversity quantify the difference. Differences among species can be characterized by measuring any number of traits. such as body size and shape. dietary requirements. physiological tolerance of various stressors. etc.(see Chapter 17). Particular traits may be of special interest to a researcher for various reasons. such as their hypothesized role in mediating species interactions (eg beak size in birds) or their importance in tolerating different environmental conditions (eg leaf thickness in plants). However. the degree of similarity or difference among species will depend strongly on the choice of traits measured. and many traits are only applicable to particular groups of organisms (eg photosynthetic rate in plants).

Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question. but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous‐valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least‐squares models. First. a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal α= 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second. we derive a descriptive statistic.

The concept in the modern literature dates to Simpson (1944). who used ‘evolutionary inertia’ as a description of pattern in the fossil record. Wilson (1975) used ‘phylogenetic inertia’ to describe population‐level or organismal properties that can affect the course of evolution in response to selection. Many current authors now view phylogenetic inertia as an alternative hypothesis to adaptation by natural selection when attempting to explain interspecific variation. covariation or lack thereof in phenotypic traits.

Heidelberg,Phylogenetic generalised least squares (PGLS) is one of the most commonly employed phylogenetic comparative methods. The technique. a modification of generalised least squares. uses knowledge of phylogenetic relationships to produce an estimate of expected covariance in cross-species data. Closely related species are assumed to have more similar traits because of their shared ancestry and hence produce more similar residuals from the least squares regression line. By taking into account the expected covariance structure of these residuals. modified slope and intercept estimates are generated that can account for interspecific autocorrelation due to phylogeny.

In insular passerines. for instance. increased bill size may facilitate generalist foraging because it allows access to a broader range of feeding niches. Here we use morphologically and ecologically divergent races of white‐eyes (Zosteropidae) to test three predictions of this explanation: (1) island populations show a wider feeding niche than mainland populations; (2) island‐dwelling populations are made up of individual generalists; and (3) within insular populations there is a positive association between size and degree of foraging generalism.

Furthermore. mechanisms that may shift fish community structure in the presence of cleaning organisms are unclear. Here we show that on patch reefs (61–285 m2) which had all cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus (Labridae) experimentally removed (1–5 adults reef−1) and which were then maintained cleaner-fish free over 8.5 years. individuals of two site-attached (resident) client damselfishes (Pomacentridae) were smaller compared to those on control reefs. Furthermore. resident fishes were 37% less abundant and 23% less species rich per reef. compared to control reefs. Such changes in site-attached fish may reflect lower fish growth rates and/or survivorship. Additionally. juveniles of visitors (fish likely to move between reefs) were 65% less abundant on removal reefs suggesting cleaners may also affect recruitment. This may. in part. explain the 23% lower abundance and 33% lower species richness of visitor fishes. and 66% lower abundance of visitor herbivores (Acanthuridae) on removal reefs that we also observed. This is the first study to demonstrate a benefit of cleaning behaviour to client individuals. in the form of increased size. and to elucidate potential mechanisms leading to community-wide effects on the fish population.

In this study. we used matrix population models. which link birth. growth and survival to population growth rate. to examine how and why population growth rates vary within and among 50 terrestrial plant species. Population growth rates were more similar within species than among species; with phylogeny having a minimal influence on among‐species variation. Most population growth rates decreased over the observation period and were negatively autocorrelated between years; that is. higher than average population growth rates tended to be followed by lower than average population growth rates. Population growth rates varied more through time than space; this temporal variation was due mostly to variation in …,True,VifCxPYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,89,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01506.x,13038469630816138667,/scholar?cites=13038469630816138667,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01506.x,0,0,0
1114416,Independent contrasts and PGLS regression estimators are equivalent,2012,Simon P Blomberg and James G Lefevre and Jessie A Wells and Mary Waterhouse,61,Systematic Biology,3,382-391,Oxford University Press,We prove that the slope parameter of the ordinary least squares regression of phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) conducted through the origin is identical to the slope parameter of the method of generalized least squares (GLSs) regression under a Brownian motion model of evolution. This equivalence has several implications: 1. Understanding the structure of the linear model for GLS regression provides insight into when and why phylogeny is important in comparative studies. 2. The limitations of the PIC regression analysis are the same as the limitations of the GLS model. In particular. phylogenetic covariance applies only to the response variable in the regression and the explanatory variable should be regarded as fixed. Calculation of PICs for explanatory variables should be treated as a mathematical idiosyncrasy of the PIC regression algorithm. 3.

Most phylogenetic comparative methods do not account for such uncertainties. Not accounting for these sources of uncertainty leads to false perceptions of precision (confidence intervals will be too narrow) and inflated significance in hypothesis testing (e.g. p-values will be too small). Although there is some application-specific software for fitting Bayesian models accounting for phylogenetic error. more general and flexible software is desirable.

Species with long gaps in their sighting records. which might be considered possibly extinct. are often rediscovered. We used data on rediscovery rates of missing mammals to test whether extinction from different causes is equally detectable and to find which traits affect the probability of rediscovery. We find that species affected by habitat loss were much more likely to be misclassified as extinct or to remain missing than those affected by introduced predators and diseases. or overkill. unless they had very restricted distributions. We conclude that extinctions owing to habitat loss are most difficult to detect; hence. impacts of habitat loss on extinction have probably been overestimated. especially relative to introduced species.

Among ungulates. there is a dichotomy between species in which offspring follow the mother (“following” strategy) versus species in which offspring remain concealed (‘hiding’ strategy). Here we reveal that the same dichotomy exists among macropods (kangaroos. wallabies and allies). We test three traditional adaptive explanations and one new life history hypothesis. and find very similar patterns among both ungulates and macropods. The three traditional explanations that we tested were that a ‘following’ strategy is associated with (1) open habitat. (2) large mothers. and (3) gregariousness.

Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first. a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second. a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient.We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf. stem. and root traits for 54 woody plant species. including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions.We examined the within‐community …,True,RC2lURgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1018,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/07-1134.1,1968800575719359684,/scholar?cites=1968800575719359684,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dab2/e7fe7863e75d3535d45d3ddcaaac2a32fca1.pdf,0,0,0

We examined the co-occurrence patterns of over 1100 tree species in a 25-hectare Amazonian forest plot in relation to field-measured functional traits. Using a null model approach. we show that co-occurring trees are often less ecologically similar than a niche-free (neutral) model predicts. Furthermore. we find evidence for processes that simultaneously drive convergence and divergence in key aspects of plant strategy. suggesting that at least two distinct niche-based processes are occurring. Our results show that strategy differentiation among species contributes to the maintenance of diversity in one of the most diverse tropical forests in the world.,True,RC2lURgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1002,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/322/5901/580.abstract,17540131098374137077,/scholar?cites=17540131098374137077,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/15911/stri_Kraft_et_al_2008.pdf,0,0,0

Within a local community. competition leads to ecological differentiation of coexisting species. while habitat filtering reduces the spread of trait values. reflecting shared ecological tolerances. Many statistical tests for the effects of competition exist in the literature. but measures of habitat filtering are less well‐developed. Here. we present convex hull volume. a construct from computational geometry. which provides an n‐dimensional measure of the volume of trait space occupied by species in a community. Combined with ecological null models. this measure offers a useful test for habitat filtering. We use convex hull volume and a null model to analyze California woody‐plant trait and community data.

Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity. ecological sorting. and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance of ecological sorting processes (community assembly. migration. habitat tracking. etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities. plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are well adapted. so their distributions. and the distributions of associated functional traits. will reflect the distribution of optimal or near‐optimal environmental conditions in space and time.

In an effort to explain the coexistence of 17 oak species within forest communities in North Central Florida. we examined correlations between the phylogenetic relatedness of oak species. their degree of co‐occurrence within communities and niche overlap across environmental gradients. and their similarity in ecophysiological and life‐history traits.

We present a trait‐based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species’ trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species’ position along a gradient defined by community‐level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species’ trait values and the mean of co‐occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California. beta trait values for specific leaf area. leaf size. wood density and maximum height all covary strongly. reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability.

Because species traits often reflect shared evolutionary history. many researchers have assumed that maximizing phylogenetic diversity (PD) should indirectly capture FD. a hypothesis that we name the “phylogenetic gambit”. Here. we empirically test this gambit using data on ecologically relevant traits from> 15.000 vertebrate species. Specifically. we estimate a measure of surrogacy of PD for FD. We find that maximizing PD results in an average gain of 18% of FD relative to random choice. However. this average gain obscures the fact that in over one-third of the comparisons. maximum PD sets contain less FD than randomly chosen sets of species.

To examine niche differences. we must first characterize how species occupy niche space. and two approaches are commonly used in the ecological literature.

Ecological studies have demonstrated its importance in natural communities. but evolutionary models have predicted that selection either impedes coexistence or diminishes the storage effect if there is coexistence. Here. we develop a lottery model of competition in which two species experience a trade‐off in competitive ability between two types of years. We use an adaptive evolution framework to determine conditions favoring the evolution of the storage effect.

1114474,The effect of phylogenetic uncertainty and imputation on EDGE Scores,2019,K Bodie Weedop and Arne Ø Mooers and Caroline M Tucker and William D Pearse,,Animal Conservation,,,,Faced with the challenge of saving as much diversity as possible given financial and time constraints. conservation biologists are increasingly prioritizing species on the basis of their overall contribution to evolutionary diversity. Metrics such as EDGE (Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered) have been used to set such evolutionarily based conservation priorities for a number of taxa. such as mammals. birds. corals. amphibians. and sharks. Each application of EDGE has required some form of correction to account for species whose positions within the tree of life are unknown. Perhaps the most advanced of these corrections is phylogenetic imputation. but to date there has been no systematic assessment of both the sensitivity of EDGE scores to a phylogeny missing species. and the impact of using imputation to correct for species missing from the tree.

Recording areas with high endemism is increasingly recognized as important for conservation activities. As a result of concepts such as biodiversity hotspots and documents such as the Convention on Biological Diversity. endemism is now a common concept in scientific. political. and conservation circles.

FD) is a reasonable prioritization objective. Because species traits are often similar among closely related species (phylogenetic signal). many researchers have advocated for a “phylogenetic gambit”: maximizing phylogenetic diversity (PD) should indirectly capture FD. To our knowledge. this gambit has not been subject to a focused empirical test. Here we use data from >15.000 vertebrate species to empirically test it. We delineate >10.000 species pools and test whether prioritizing the most phylogenetically diverse set of species results in more or less FD relative to a random choice. We find that. across species pools. maximizing PD results in an average gain of 18% of FD relative to a random choice. suggesting that PD is a sound conservation prioritization strategy. However. this averaged gain hides important variability: for 10% of the species pools. maximizing PD can capture less FD than an averaged random scheme because of recent trait divergence and/or very strong trait conservatism. In addition. within a species pool. many random sets of species actually yield more FD than the PD-maximized selection – on average 36% of the time per pool. If the traits we used are representative of traits we wish to conserve. our results suggest that conservation initiatives focusing on PD will. on average. capture more FD than a random strategy. but this gain will not systematically yield more FD than random and thus can be considered risky.,True,86c0g5oAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,3,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/243923v2.abstract,4573456514665500828,/scholar?cites=4573456514665500828,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/01/09/243923.full.pdf,0,0,0

Thus. understanding phenotypic attributes that allow species to partition resources is fundamentally important to explaining diversity-productivity relationships.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use data from a long-term experiment (Cedar Creek. MN) and compare the extent to which productivity is explained by seven types of community metrics of functional variation: 1) species richness. 2) variation in 10 individual traits. 3) functional group richness. 4) a distance-based measure of functional diversity. 5) a hierarchical multivariate clustering method. 6) a nonmetric multidimensional scaling approach. and 7) a phylogenetic diversity measure. summing phylogenetic branch lengths connecting community members together and may be a surrogate for ecological differences. Although most of these diversity measures provided significant explanations of variation in productivity. the presence of a nitrogen fixer and phylogenetic diversity were the two best explanatory variables. Further. a statistical model that included the presence of a nitrogen fixer. seed weight and phylogenetic diversity was a better explanation of community productivity than other models.

We used an experimental microbial landscape to determine whether dispersal occurring at two different scales – among local communities and among metacommunities – affects diversity differently. At the local scale. dispersal initially had a positive effect and subsequently a neutral effect on diversity. whereas at the metacommunity and landscape scales. dispersal showed a consistently negative effect. The timing in which dispersal affected beta diversity also differed sharply between local communities and metacommunities. These patterns were explained by scale‐ and time‐dependent effects of dispersal in allowing spread of species and in removing spatial refuges from predators.

It forms one explanation of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) for local communities—specifically that diversity should be maximized at intermediate disturbance frequencies. yet only a fraction of empirical studies support IDH predictions. Similarly. this trade‐off is also a powerful explanation of coexistence at larger spatial scales. I show. with a microbial experimental system. that the diversity–disturbance relationship is dependent on the relative distribution of species along this trade‐off.

We tested for the presence of competition‐colonization trade‐offs with a commonly used artificial assemblage consisting of protozoan and rotifer species. where colonization was the ability of a species to establish populations in patches.

Fischlin et al.(2007) found that 20 to 30% of the plant and animal species that had been assessed to that time were considered to be at increased risk of extinction if the global average temperature increase exceeds 2 C to 3 C above the preindustrial level with medium confidence. and that substantial changes in structure and functioning of terrestrial. marine. and other aquatic ecosystems are very likely under that degree of warming and associated atmospheric CO2 concentration. No time scale was associated with these findings. The carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems were considered to be at high risk from climate change and land use change.

Historically. an obvious way in which to describe community compositions has been diversity in terms of the number and abundances of species. However. the failure to reject contradictory models has led to communities now being characterized by trait and phylogenetic diversities. Our objective here is to demonstrate how species. trait and phylogenetic diversity can be combined together from large to local spatial scales to reveal the historical. deterministic and stochastic processes that impact the compositions of local communities.

This task is becoming even more urgent with the current increase of habitat loss. Many methods–from rapid biodiversity assessments (RBA) to all-taxa biodiversity inventories (ATBI)–have been developed for decades to estimate local species richness. However. these methods are costly and invasive. Several animals–birds. mammals. amphibians. fishes and arthropods–produce sounds when moving. communicating or sensing their environment. Here we propose a new concept and method to describe biodiversity. We suggest to forego species or morphospecies identification used by ATBI and RBA respectively but rather to tackle the problem at another evolutionary unit. the community level. We also propose that a part of diversity can be estimated and compared through a rapid acoustic analysis of the sound produced by animal communities. We produced α and β diversity indexes that we first tested with 540 simulated acoustic communities. The α index. which measures acoustic entropy. shows a logarithmic correlation with the number of species within the acoustic community. The β index. which estimates both temporal and spectral dissimilarities. is linearly linked to the number of unshared species between acoustic communities. We then applied both indexes to two closely spaced Tanzanian dry lowland coastal forests. Indexes reveal for this small sample a lower acoustic diversity for the most disturbed forest and acoustic dissimilarities between the two forests suggest that degradation could have significantly …,True,N7hr6UMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,462,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004065,17175701906897930643,/scholar?cites=17175701906897930643,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004065,0,0,0

We show how to compute such distances from a generalization of Gower's distance. which is dedicated to the treatment of mixed data. We prove Gower's distance can be extended to include new types of data. The impact of this generalization is illustrated on a real data set containing 80 plant species and 13 various traits. Gower's distance allows an efficient treatment of missing data and the inclusion of variable weights. An evaluation of the real contribution of each variable to the mixed distance is proposed.

The behaviour of the proposed measures is illustrated with one small artificial data set. together with actual examples on the species functional turnover along successional gradients. We believe this new framework provides an important contribution for the clarification and quantification of key metrics of community redundancy and vulnerability.

Many species distributions observed on this island are extremely restricted. localized to mountains or rivers making biodiversity evaluation and conservation a difficult task. A rapid biodiversity assessment method based on acoustics was recently proposed. This method could help to document the unique spatial structure observed in New Caledonia. Here. this method was applied in an attempt to reveal differences among three mountain sites (Mandjélia. Koghis and Aoupinié) with similar ecological features and species richness level. but with high beta diversity according to different microendemic assemblages. In each site. several local acoustic communities were sampled with audio recorders. An automatic acoustic sampling was run on these three sites for a period of 82 successive days. Acoustic properties of animal communities were analysed without any species identification. A frequency spectral complexity index (NP) was used as an estimate of the level of acoustic activity and a frequency spectral dissimilarity index (Df) assessed acoustic differences between pairs of recordings. As expected. the index NP did not reveal significant differences in the acoustic activity level between the three sites. However. the acoustic variability estimated by the index Df. could first be explained by changes in the acoustic communities along the 24-hour cycle and second by acoustic dissimilarities between the three sites. The results support the hypothesis that global acoustic analyses can detect acoustic differences between sites with similar species richness …,True,N7hr6UMAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,94,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065311,7390274409123994630,/scholar?cites=7390274409123994630,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065311,0,0,0

1114549,Variation within and between closely related species uncovers high intra-specific variability in dispersal,2010,Virginie M Stevens and Sandrine Pavoine and Michel Baguette,5,PLoS One,6,e11123,Public Library of Science,Mounting evidence shows that contrasting selection pressures generate variability in dispersal patterns among individuals or populations of the same species. with potential impacts on both species dynamics and evolution. However. this variability is hardly considered in empirical works. where a single dispersal function is considered to adequately reflect the species-specific dispersal ability. suggesting thereby that within-species variation is negligible as regard to inter-specific differences in dispersal abilities. We propose here an original method to make the comparison of intra- and inter-specific variability in dispersal. by decomposing the diversity of that trait along a phylogeny of closely related species. We used as test group European butterflies that are classic study organisms in spatial ecology. We apply the analysis separately to eight metrics that reflect the dispersal propensity. the dispersal ability or the dispersal efficiency of populations and species. At the inter-specific level. only the dispersal ability showed the signature of a phylogenetic signal while neither the dispersal propensity nor the dispersal efficiency did. At the within-species level. the partitioning of dispersal diversity showed that dispersal was variable or highly variable among populations: intra-specific variability represented from 11% to 133% of inter-specific variability in dispersal metrics. This finding shows that dispersal variation is far from negligible in the wild. Understanding the processes behind this high within-species variation should allow us to properly account for dispersal in demographic models. Accordingly. to encompass the within species variability in life histories …,True,N7hr6UMAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,89,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0011123,13754679823773263387,/scholar?cites=13754679823773263387,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0011123,0,0,0

Among them. the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (Excoffier et al.. 1992) has the advantage of including evolutionary distances between individuals. AMOVA is a special case of a far more general statistical scheme produced by Rao (1982a; 1986) and called the apportionment of quadratic entropy (APQE). It links diversity and dissimilarity and allows the decomposition of diversity according to a given hierarchy. We apply this framework to ecological data showing that APQE may be very useful for studying diversity at various spatial scales. Moreover. the quadratic entropy has a critical advantage over usual diversity indices because it takes into account differences between species.

We examine whether aerial hyperspectral (414–2501 nm) remote sensing can be used to discriminate between grazed vegetation belonging to different grassland successional stages. Vascular plant species were recorded in 104.1 m 2 plots on the island of Öland (Sweden) and the functional properties of the plant species recorded in the plots were characterized in terms of the ground-cover of grasses. specific leaf area and Ellenberg indicator values. Plots were assigned to three different grassland age-classes. representing 5–15. 16–50 and> 50 years of grazing management. Partial least squares discriminant analysis models were used to compare classifications based on aerial hyperspectral data with the age-class classification. The remote sensing data successfully classified the plots into age-classes: the overall classification accuracy was higher for a model based on a pre-selected set of wavebands (85%. Kappa statistic value= 0.77) than one using the full set of wavebands (77%. Kappa statistic value= 0.65). Our results show that nutrient availability and grass cover differences between grassland age-classes are detectable by spectral imaging.

Veg. pattern, Process. Conserv",10.13140,,,Background: The trait composition of plant communities is determined by abiotic. biotic and historical factors. However. the importance of macro-climatic factors in explaining trait-environment relationships at the local scale remains unclear. In March 2013. the first sDiv workshop (sPlot) assembled a unique group of vegetation-plot data holders and data analysts to address these questions. Our main objective is to assess the following questions:(i) to which extent are relationships between traits preserved across environmental gradients worldwide. irrespective of macro climate?(ii) to which degree is the effect of local (abiotic and biotic) drivers mediated by climate? Such knowledge is crucial for ecological theory but also highly relevant to devise local management measures to mitigate the negative effects of climate change.Available data and the database: While hundreds of millions of distribution records from individual species can be retrieved via data portals such as GBIF (http://www. gbif. org) and there is now also a global database of plant traits (TRY; Kattge et al. 2011). global accessibility of plant community data is more restricted.

In this article we describe patterns of functional trait variation and trait correlations within and among habitats in relation to several environmental and trade‐off axes. We then ask whether such patterns reflect natural selection and can be considered plant strategies. In so doing we highlight evidence that demonstrates that (1) patterns of trait variation across resource and environmental gradients (light. water. nutrients. and temperature) probably reflect adaptation. (2) plant trait variation typically involves multiple‐correlated traits that arise because of inevitable trade‐offs among traits and across levels of whole‐plant integration and that must be understood from a whole‐plant perspective. and (3) such adaptation may be globally …,True,CtxI-i0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1174,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/374368,17965996145245781375,/scholar?cites=17965996145245781375,,https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/177645/Reich%20et%20al%202003.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

In an effort to explain the coexistence of 17 oak species within forest communities in North Central Florida. we examined correlations between the phylogenetic relatedness of oak species. their degree of co‐occurrence within communities and niche overlap across environmental gradients. and their similarity in ecophysiological and life‐history traits.

Thus. understanding phenotypic attributes that allow species to partition resources is fundamentally important to explaining diversity-productivity relationships.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use data from a long-term experiment (Cedar Creek. MN) and compare the extent to which productivity is explained by seven types of community metrics of functional variation: 1) species richness. 2) variation in 10 individual traits. 3) functional group richness. 4) a distance-based measure of functional diversity. 5) a hierarchical multivariate clustering method. 6) a nonmetric multidimensional scaling approach. and 7) a phylogenetic diversity measure. summing phylogenetic branch lengths connecting community members together and may be a surrogate for ecological differences. Although most of these diversity measures provided significant explanations of variation in productivity. the presence of a nitrogen fixer and phylogenetic diversity were the two best explanatory variables. Further. a statistical model that included the presence of a nitrogen fixer. seed weight and phylogenetic diversity was a better explanation of community productivity than other models.  Conclusions Evolutionary relationships among species appear to explain patterns of grassland productivity.

Fagaceae) have failed to resolve the backbone topology of the genus with strong support. Here. we utilize next-generation sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-Seq) to resolve a framework phylogeny of a predominantly American clade of oaks whose crown age is estimated at 23–33 million years old. Using a recently developed analytical pipeline for RAD-Seq phylogenetics. we created a concatenated matrix of 1.40 E06 aligned nucleotides. constituting 27.727 sequence clusters. RAD-Seq data were readily combined across runs. with no difference in phylogenetic placement between technical replicates. which overlapped by only 43–64% in locus coverage. 17% (4.715) of the loci we analyzed could be mapped with high confidence to one or more expressed sequence tags in NCBI Genbank. A concatenated matrix of the loci that BLAST to at least one EST sequence provides approximately half as many variable or parsimony-informative characters as equal-sized datasets from the non-EST loci. The EST-associated matrix is more complete (fewer missing loci) and has slightly lower homoplasy than non-EST subsampled matrices of the same size. but there is no difference in phylogenetic support or relative attribution of base substitutions to internal versus terminal branches of the phylogeny. We introduce a partitioned RAD visualization method (implemented in the R package RADami; http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RADami) to investigate the possibility that suboptimal topologies supported by large numbers of loci—due. for example. to reticulate evolution or lineage sorting …,True,CtxI-i0AAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC,186,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093975,3457677996083796505,/scholar?cites=3457677996083796505,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093975,0,0,0

Leaf area per shoot increased and Huber values (ratio of sapwood area to leaf area) decreased with increasing soil moisture of species’ habitats. As a result. maximum hydraulic conductance and maximum transpiration were positively correlated with mean soil moisture when calculated on a sapwood area basis. but not when calculated on a leaf area basis. This reveals the important role that changes in allometry among closely related species can play in co‐ordinating water transport capacity with soil water availability.

We hypothesized that the global distribution of dormant seeds derives from their adaptive value in predictably fluctuating (i.e. seasonal) environments. However. the advantage conferred by dormancy might ultimately depend on other seed attributes. particularly size. This general model was tested within a phylogenetically informed framework using a data set comprising > 216 000 world‐wide observations of Fabaceae. spanning three orders of magnitude in seed size and including both dormant and nondormant seeds.

To examine niche differences. we must first characterize how species occupy niche space. and two approaches are commonly used in the ecological literature. The first uses species traits to estimate multivariate trait space (so‐called functional trait diversity. FD); the second quantifies the amount of time or evolutionary history captured by a group of species (phylogenetic diversity. PD). It is often—but controversially—assumed that these putative measures of niche space are at a minimum correlated and perhaps redundant. since more evolutionary time allows for greater accumulation of trait changes.

The book's emphasis is on quantifying the variety. abundance. and occurrence of taxa. and on providing objective and clear guidance for both scientists and managers. This is a fast-moving field and one that is the focus of intense research interest. However the rapid development of new methods. the inconsistent and sometimes confusing application of old ones. and the lack of consensus in the literature about the best approach. means that there is a real need for a current synthesis. Biological Diversity covers fundamental measurement issues such as sampling. re-examines familiar diversity metrics (including species richness. diversity statistics. and estimates of spatial and temporal turnover). discusses species abundance distributions and how best to fit them. explores species occurrence and the spatial structure of biodiversity. and investigates alternative approaches used to assess trait. phylogenetic. and genetic diversity.

We examine and evaluate recent developments in and connections between these two aspects. and suggest directions for future research.

This measure approximates the evolutionary history that each species embodies and sums to the phylogenetic diversity of the entire taxonomic tree.

Complexity increases with size. independently of phylogeny. This is interpreted in economic terms as the consequence of a greater degree of cooperative division of labour within larger entities. The rate of increase of complexity with size is less in the case of a cooperative division of labour (cell types within bodies) than in the analogous case of a competitive division of labour (species within communities). This is atttributed to the inutility of single specialized cells whose goods must be shared among all the many cells of a large organism.

Oxford University Press, Oxford",,194-207,,Biodiversity has been described as the ‘biology of numbers and difference’(Gaston 1996). Because species are different from one another. traditional metrics of biodiversity such as species richness or evenness increase when there are more species or when abundance is more equally apportioned among these species (see Chapters4 and 5). Not only are species different from one another. the magnitude of these differences varies tremendously depending on the set of species in question. Consider two hypothetical islands. each with only two species of vertebrate animals in equal abundance: two birds in one case and a bird plus a mammal in the other. Both islands have species richness= 2 (for vertebrates) and the same maximal value of species evenness. However. our intuition tells us that a bird plus a mammal represents more biodiversity than does two birds (Purvis & Hector 2000). Metrics of phylogenetic diversity quantify the difference. Differences among species can be characterized by measuring any number of traits. such as body size and shape. dietary requirements. physiological tolerance of various stressors. etc.(see Chapter 17). Particular traits may be of special interest to a researcher for various reasons. such as their hypothesized role in mediating species interactions (eg beak size in birds) or their importance in tolerating different environmental conditions (eg leaf thickness in plants). However. the degree of similarity or difference among species will depend strongly on the choice of traits measured. and many traits are only applicable to particular groups of organisms (eg photosynthetic rate in plants).

We compare explicit models describing the evolution of phenotypic characters over the phylogeny of a group. employing a method that avoids point estimates of ancestor reconstructions (see Maddison 1990. 1995; Losos and Miles 1994; Schluter et al. 1997; Zhang and Nei 1997; see also Pagel 1997). We contrast well-characterized models of change in species-specific phenotype: gradual change. in which differences in trait values among species are expected to be proportional to the time available for change; genetic change. in which the differences between species in the tested trait are correlated with the number of inferred substitutions that have accumulated between them (Omland 1997; Pagel 1997); and speciational change (Rohlf et al. 1990; Martins and Garland 1991; see Diaz-Uriarte and Garland 1996; Pagel 1997). in which …,True,Yj-miX0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,124,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/303226,2648632847861405950,/scholar?cites=2648632847861405950,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42623096/Mooers_etal_AmNat99.pdf,0,0,0

Series B: Biological Sciences,1443,613-620,The Royal Society,If we are to plan conservation strategies that minimize the loss of evolutionary history through human–caused extinctions. we must understand how this loss is related to phylogenetic patterns in current extinction risks and past speciation rates. Nee & May (1997. Science 278. 692–694) showed that for a randomly evolving clade (i) a single round of random extinction removed relatively little evolutionary history. and (ii) extinction management (choosing which taxa to sacrifice) offered only marginal improvement. However. both speciation rates and extinction risks vary across lineages within real clades. We simulated evolutionary trees with phylogenetically patterned speciation rates and extinction risks (closely related lineages having similar rates and risks) and then subjected them to several biologically informed models of extinction.

However. there are few convincing examples of traits that are repeatedly and consistently associated with increased diversification. The paucity of such cases may reflect the contingent nature of the diversifying effect of key traits. These contingencies can be viewed as statistical interactions between the trait and at least three kinds of factors: (1) other taxa. (2) other traits of the group itself. and (3) the physical environment. I describe tentative examples in each of these categories: (1) a dampening of the diversification of clades with image-forming eyes by groups that earlier evolved such eyes.

Our results suggest that diversification within this complex. during the Miocene and Pleistocene. is associated with both niche divergence and niche conservatism. with a pattern that varies depending on whether the variables involved are related to the mean or seasonality of temperature and humidity. Moreover. climatic variables related to humidity and temperature seasonality were involved in the niche shift and genetic diversification of the European/North African clade during the Pleistocene and in its maintenance in a fundamental niche distinct from that of the remaining members of the group.

Dissertação de Doutoramento em Biologia, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa",,,,Given the current global biodiversity crisis. prioritizing conservation areas that maximize species representation and enable persistence has been a major goal of systematic conservation planning. Despite the progresses in the field. there are still challenges needed to be overcome. This thesis aims to address some unresolved issues in conservation planning. by using the Western Mediterranean region as study area and the amphibians and reptiles occurring there as biological models. This thesis contributed to the knowledge and understanding of the distribution of amphibians and reptiles in the Western Mediterranean region. Field sampling in Morocco increased the number of known species occurrences. Species distribution models were developed to predict the occurrences in under-sampled areas. and to improve the understanding on relationships between species ranges and environmental conditions. The consequences of using different types of distribution data on the performance of reserve selection algorithms were analysed. Several scenarios were simulated. including variable proportions of species distribution data. conservation targets and costs. The recommended type of data to use varies according to scenarios. but data sets with both observed and predicted distributions generally provided good solutions in most circumstances. Novel approaches were developed to incorporate evolutionary processes into conservation planning. through surrogate use for both the neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity.

These methods have led to considerable new insights. but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day species distributions. Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the distributions of species within a clade. this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity.

In the face of such a global driver of species loss. we urgently need to identify refugia that will shelter species from the worst impacts of climate change. This will be a critical component of successful conservation and management of our biodiversity. Despite this. little is known about how best to identify refugia in the landscape. and the practical strategies needed to identify. protect and expand refugia are just beginning to be developed. Identifying refugia that will protect most species. or large numbers of species. remains a complex and daunting endeavour due to the large variations in climatic and biotic requirements of species.A first step to identifying refugia for biodiversity across Australia is to locate the areas which show the least change into the future (ie the most environmentally stable). particularly along axes of temperature and precipitation. The second and crucial step is to identify the areas that will retain most of their biodiversity and provide opportunities for additional species to relocate to into the future. Using these approaches in this project. we take the first steps to identify refugial areas across the Australian continent under contemporary climate change scenarios. We find that the southern and eastern parts of the continent contain refugia that many species will retreat to over the next 75 years. but that the current reserve system may be inadequate to allow species to shift to and persist in these areas. Disturbingly. we also find that there is a large portion of the Australian vertebrate community for which adequate natural refugia do not appear to …,True,xBirIWMAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC,66,https://www.academia.edu/download/31420395/2013_Reside_etal_NARPreport_ClimateChangeRefugiaForTerrestrialBiodiversity.pdf,10917282284541300904,/scholar?cites=10917282284541300904,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31420395/2013_Reside_etal_NARPreport_ClimateChangeRefugiaForTerrestrialBiodiversity.pdf,0,0,0

Evolutionary refugia. areas of relative habitat stability in this shifting landscape. support persistence of lineages through time. and are thus crucial to the accumulation and maintenance of biodiversity. Areas of endemism are indicative of refugial areas where diversity has persisted. and endemism of intraspecific lineages in particular is strongly associated with late-Pleistocene habitat stability. However. it remains a challenge to consistently estimate the geographic ranges of intraspecific lineages and thus infer phylogeographic endemism. because spatial sampling for genetic analyses is typically sparse relative to species records. We present a novel technique to model the geographic distribution of intraspecific lineages. which is informed by the ecological niche of a species and known locations of its constituent lineages. Our approach allows for the effects of isolation by unsuitable habitat. and captures uncertainty in the extent of lineage ranges. Applying this method to the arc of rainforest areas spanning 3500 km in eastern Australia. we estimated lineage endemism for 53 species of rainforest dependent herpetofauna with available phylogeographic data.

We developed a new measure for phylogenetic signal of binary traits.

We applied D to the red‐list status of British birds and the world's mammals and found that the threat status for both groups exhibited moderately strong phylogenetic clumping.

Using primates as a model. we show that infectious diseases are more often shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographical region. We find that host relatedness is the best overall predictor of whether two host species share the same pathogens.

We use sister species comparisons to evaluate the relationship between morphological disparity and regional patterns of co‐occurrence across carnivores. Up to 63% of the variation in range overlap can be explained by morphological divergence in dentition. Species that differ more in carnassial tooth length overlap more in their geographical range. Carnassials are the primary teeth associated with food processing. and hence difference in carnassial size may be a good indicator of difference in resource use. We suggest this pattern is consistent with competition in sympatry driving ecological character displacement. or competitive exclusion among ecologically similar species.

We show a robust scaling law that emerges uniquely at the level of whole ecosystems and is conserved across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. This pattern describes the changing structure and productivity of the predator-prey biomass pyramid. which represents the biomass of communities at different levels of the food chain. Scaling exponents of the relation between predator versus prey biomass and community production versus biomass are often near ¾. which indicates that very different communities of species exhibit similar high-level structure and function.

This article starts by sketching how phylogenetic. geographic. and trait information can be combined to elucidate present mammalian diversity patterns and how they arose. Recent diversification rates and standing diversity show different geographic patterns. indicating that cradles of diversity have moved over time. Patterns in extinction risk reflect both biological differences among mammalian lineages and differences in threat intensity among regions.

We placed geoxyles within the most comprehensive dated phylogeny for the regional flora comprising over 1400 woody species. Using this phylogeny. we tested whether African geoxyles evolved concomitantly with those of the South American cerrado and used their phylogenetic position to date the appearance of humid savannas.

In this study. experiments with the Mexican blue crab Callinectes rathbunae parasitized by the rhizocephalan barnacle Loxothylacus texanus were conducted in the laboratory to test whether the parasite affects the host¹s oxygen consumption rate under changing salinity conditions. A total of 83 crabs (49 parasitized and 34 controls). all initially acclimated to a salinity of 5. were used for metabolic rate measurements over sequential 24 h periods at salinities of 5. 15 and 25.

For half a century. the Lepeophtheirus life cycle has been regarded as the only copepod life cycle including 8 post-nauplius instars as confirmed in four different species. including L. salmonis. Here we prove that the accepted life cycle of the salmon louse is wrong. By observations of chalimus larvae molting in incubators and by morphometric cluster analysis. we show that there are only two chalimus instars: chalimus 1 (comprising the former chalimus I and II stages which are not separated by a molt) and chalimus 2 (the former chalimus III and IV stages which are not separated by a molt). Consequently the salmon louse life cycle has only six post-nauplius instars. as in other genera of caligid sea lice and copepods in general. These findings are of fundamental importance in experimental studies as well as for interpretation of salmon louse biology and for control and management of this economically important parasite.,True,tpnwvUMAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC,209,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073539,10401643197525391447,/scholar?cites=10401643197525391447,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073539,0,0,0

Tagmosis patterns are not considered. although the origins and patterns of heteronomy within the postantennulary limb series are analysed.The phenomenon of annulation is examined and two basic types of annuli are recognised: terminal and intercalary. The annulation of the apical segment of a limb results in the formation of terminal flagella. and is typical of primarily sensory appendages such as insect and malacostracan antennules and maxillary palps of some hexapods.

In this model most compound segments result from the failure of expression of articulations separating ancestral segments. In adult males. however. compound segments either side of the neocopepodan geniculation are typically formed by secondary fusion at the last moult from CoV (stage 5). The array of segments distal to the articulation separating segments XX and XXI is highly conserved both in ontogeny and phylogeny: typically the distal segmentation of the adult female is already present in the CoI.

However. taxonomy is usually described as a science in crisis. lacking manpower and funding. a politically acknowledged problem known as the Taxonomic Impediment. Using data from the Fauna Europaea database and the Zoological Record. we show that contrary to general belief. developed and heavily-studied parts of the world are important reservoirs of unknown species. In Europe. new species of multicellular terrestrial and freshwater animals are being discovered and named at an unprecedented rate: since the 1950s. more than 770 new species are on average described each year from Europe. which add to the 125.000 terrestrial and freshwater multicellular species already known in this region. There is no sign of having reached a plateau that would allow for the assessment of the magnitude of European biodiversity.

1114809,Copepods parasitic on Brazilian coastal fishes: a handbook,1997,Geoffrey A Boxshall and MA Montú,5,Nauplius,1,1-225,,Parasitic crustaceans are common on ﬁsh hosts in coastal marine and brackish waters. Three major groups of Crustacea contain ﬁsh parasites: the lsopoda. the Branchiura and the Copepoda. They can be readily distinguished with the aid of a few key characters. lsopods are typically dorsoventraily ﬂattened crustaceans (Fig. HA) without a carapace. Their body is usually divided into a small cephalon which incorporates the first thoracic. maxilliped-bearing. somite. a thorax or peraeon of 7 somites and an abdomen or pieon of6 somites. The compound eyes are visible both dorsally and ventrally (Fig.'i. tC) on the margins of the cephalon. The only exception to this basic body plan that is relevant here is the family Gnathiidae which will be considered below. Typical isopod fish parasites are found in some families belonging to the suborder Fiabeilifera. such as the Aegidae and the Cymothoidae.

The musculature of the penis on trunk somite 7 of the male suggests that it is derived by modification of the seventh thoracopods. The importance of trunk somite numbers in maxillopodan systematics is reexamined and an attempt is made to apply the concept of homology to the developmental processes determining somite numbers.

Here. after reporting the results of an intensive faunistic survey of marine microscopic animals (meiofauna) in Northern Sardinia. we test for the effect of body size. dispersal ability. and habitat features on the patterns of distribution of several groups.   Methodology/Principal Findings As a dataset we use the results of a workshop held at La Maddalena (Sardinia. Italy) in September 2010. aimed at studying selected taxa of soft-bodied meiofauna (Acoela. Annelida. Gastrotricha. Nemertodermatida. Platyhelminthes and Rotifera). in conjunction with data on the same taxa obtained during a previous workshop hosted at Tjärnö (Western Sweden) in September 2007. Using linear mixed effects models and model averaging while accounting for sampling bias and potential pseudoreplication. we found evidence that: (1) meiofaunal groups with more restricted distribution are the ones with low dispersal potential; (2) meiofaunal groups with higher probability of finding new species for science are the ones with low dispersal potential; (3) the proportion of the global species pool of each meiofaunal group present in each area at the regional scale is negatively related to body size. and positively related to their occurrence in the endobenthic habitat.

We have examined the gut contents of meiofauna from six sandy beaches in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. Out of twenty taxonomic groups. three species of the common sandy beach annelid Saccocirrus displayed in situ ingestion of microfibres in all sites. Laboratory observations showed that species of Saccocirrus are able to egest microfibres with no obvious physical injury.

Here we address these shortcomings through the analysis of four molecular markers and 87 morphological characters sampled across 127 species under the assumptions of parsimony and model‐based methods. Of the 34 newly sequenced taxa. five anchialine and 24 interstitial species were included. with increased representation of Sigalionidae. An additional 28 elusive Sigalionidae taxa were included. represented only by morphological partitions. Molecular and morphological partitions were evaluated under exhaustive sensitivity analyses. testing the effects of …,True,fAPGrvUAAAAJ:XAp-VaTZjjwC,24,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cla.12202,3670915147394571760,/scholar?cites=3670915147394571760,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cla.12202,0,0,0
1114828,A new. disjunct species of Speleonectes (Remipedia. Crustacea) from the Canary Islands,2009,Stefan Koenemann and Armin Bloechl and Alejandro Martínez and Thomas M Iliffe and Mario Hoenemann and Pedro Oromí,39,Marine Biodiversity,3,215-225,Springer Berlin/Heidelberg,We describe Speleonectes atlantida n. sp. as the third species of Remipedia that was found outside the main distribution area of this group in the Caribbean region. S. atlantida was collected by cave divers equipped with closed circuit rebreathers from the far interior of the Túnel de la Atlántida. an anchialine volcanic lava tube. on the Canarian island of Lanzarote. The new species occurs in sympatry with S. ondinae. to which it is morphologically closely related. S. atlantida can be distinguished from S. ondinae by a more slender habitus and smaller pleurotergites in the posterior trunk. The valid status of S. atlantida as a new species of Remipedia could be corroborated by intra-and interspecific comparisons of 16S rDNA and CO1 sequence data.,True,fAPGrvUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,22,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12526-009-0021-8?dom=pscau&error=cookies_not_supported&code=a4d5a275-6eeb-4fd1-93f7-44e60d395757,6349288865510759395,/scholar?cites=6349288865510759395,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50305032/A_new_disjunct_species_of_Speleonectes_20161114-2193-j5yjpv.pdf,0,0,0
1114829,Nerillidae (Annelida) from the Corona lava tube. Lanzarote. with description of Meganerilla cesari n. sp.,2009,Katrine Worsaae and Alejandro Martínez and Jorge Núñez,39,Marine Biodiversity,3,195-207,Springer Berlin/Heidelberg,Five species of Nerillidae are previously known from Atlantic cave systems. Another four species of Nerillidae are reported here from the Corona lava tube (Lanzarote. Canary Islands) presenting the first records of Mesonerilla and Meganerilla from anchialine environments. We here describe Meganerilla cesari n. sp. which resembles Meganerilla swedmarki by the leaf-shaped interramal cirri and lack of median antenna. but differs by the smaller size. shorter chaetae. dense ciliation and presence of ventral lobes on the parapodia. One identified and two unidentified species of Mesonerilla are also reported. Updated diagnoses are presented for Mesonerilla armoricana. reported here for the first time from the Canary Islands. and Leptonerilla diatomeophaga. the only nerillid previously known from the Corona lava tube. The Corona lava tube holds a large variety of benthic habitats. which may explain the high …,True,fAPGrvUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12526-009-0027-2,6748940784207607028,/scholar?cites=6748940784207607028,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50304984/Nerillidae_Annelida_from_the_Corona_la20161114-16965-1rhgncb.pdf,0,0,0
