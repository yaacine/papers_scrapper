To further the understanding of molecular pathways responding to the heavy metal chromium(VI) [Cr(VI)]. the proteome of aerobically grown. Cr(VI)-stressed P. putida strain F1 was characterized within the context of two disparate nutritional environments: rich (LB) media and minimal (M9L) media containing lactate as the sole carbon source. Growth studies demonstrated that F1 sensitivity to Cr(VI) was impacted substantially by nutrient conditions. with a carbon-source-dependent hierarchy (lactate > glucose >> acetate) observed in minimal media. Two-dimensional HPLC-MS/MS was employed to identify differential proteome profiles generated in response to 1 mM chromate under LB and M9L growth conditions.

1097149,Declining soil quality in South Africa: effects of land use on soil organic matter and surface crusting,2003,MV Fey and AJ Mills,99,South African Journal of Science,9,429-436,Sabinet,Soil conservation in South Africa has historically focused on preventing soil erosion. Effective maintenance of the soil requires. in addition to erosion control. an understanding of how land-use practices affect more subtle indicators of soil quality. This review outlines how land use in South Africa can rapidly result in a marked reduction in soil organic matter (SOM) content and increased tendency of soils to crust. Removal of a cover of vegetation. whether by ploughing. grazing or burning. tends to reduce SOM due to reduced inputs of organic matter and enhanced activity of soil microbes. Loss of SOM. particularly from the top few centimetres of soil (named here the pedoderm). has a disproportionately large effect on soil infiltrability and nutrient supply.

South Africa has been used for farming goats since the early 1900s. This habitat is characterised by a dense cover of the succulent bush Portulacaria afra and by a warm. semi-arid climate with evenly distributed annual rainfall of 250–400 mm. Heavy browsing by goats results in the loss of P. afra and transforms the thicket to an open savanna dominated by annual grasses. Eight fence-line comparisons between thicket and savanna were used to investigate differences in soil quality associated with the vegetation change.

The small turbot genome provides a source for genomics strategies to use in order to understand the genetic basis of productive traits. particularly those related to sex. growth and pathogen resistance. Genetic maps represent essential genomic screening tools allowing to localize quantitative trait loci (QTL) and to identify candidate genes through comparative mapping. This information is the backbone to develop marker-assisted selection (MAS) programs in aquaculture. Expressed sequenced tag (EST) resources have largely increased in turbot. thus supplying numerous type I markers suitable for extending the previous linkage map. which was mostly based on anonymous loci. The aim of this study was to construct a higher-resolution turbot genetic map using EST-linked markers. which will turn out to be useful for comparative mapping studies. A consensus gene-enriched genetic map of the turbot was constructed using 463 SNP and microsatellite markers in nine reference families. This map contains 438 markers. 180 EST-linked. clustered at 24 linkage groups. Linkage and comparative genomics evidences suggested additional linkage group fusions toward the consolidation of turbot map according to karyotype information.

FASIR. and PAL-II,2010,Domingo Alcaraz-Segura and Elisa Liras and Siham Tabik and José Paruelo and Javier Cabello,10,Sensors,2,1291-1314,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,Successive efforts have processed the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor archive to produce Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets (ie. PAL. FASIR. GIMMS. and LTDR) under different corrections and processing schemes. Since NDVI datasets are used to evaluate carbon gains. differences among them may affect nations’ carbon budgets in meeting international targets (such as the Kyoto Protocol). This study addresses the consistency across AVHRR NDVI datasets in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) by evaluating whether their 1982–1999 NDVI trends show similar spatial patterns. Significant trends were calculated with the seasonal Mann-Kendall trend test and their spatial consistency with partial Mantel tests. Over 23% of the Peninsula (N. E. and central mountain ranges) showed positive and significant NDVI trends across the four datasets and an additional 18% across three datasets. In 20% of Iberia (SW quadrant). the four datasets exhibited an absence of significant trends and an additional 22% across three datasets. Significant NDVI decreases were scarce (croplands in the Guadalquivir and Segura basins. La Mancha plains. and Valencia). Spatial consistency of significant trends across at least three datasets was observed in 83% of the Peninsula. but it decreased to 47% when comparing across the four datasets. FASIR.

Developing such maps has been traditionally performed using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) methods. which usually reach good accuracies. but require a high human supervision and the best configuration for one image often cannot be extrapolated to a different image. Recently. deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding results in object recognition in computer vision and are offering promising results in land cover mapping. This paper analyzes the potential of CNN-based methods for detection of plant species of conservation concern using free high-resolution Google Earth TM images and provides an objective comparison with the state-of-the-art OBIA-methods. We consider as case study the detection of Ziziphus lotus shrubs. which are protected as a priority habitat under the European Union Habitats Directive. Compared to the best performing OBIA-method. the best CNN-detector achieved up to 12% better precision. up to 30% better recall and up to 20% better balance between precision and recall. Besides. the knowledge that CNNs acquired in the first image can be re-utilized in other regions. which makes the detection process very fast. A natural conclusion of this work is that including CNN-models as classifiers. eg. ResNet-classifier. could further improve OBIA methods. The provided methodology can be systematically reproduced for other species detection using our codes available through (https://github. com/EGuirado/CNN-remotesensing).

We identified the 3.906 vascular plants. macroinvertebrates. and vertebrates native to California. USA. that depend on fresh water for at least one stage of their life history. We evaluated the conservation status for these taxa using existing government and non-governmental organization assessments (e.g.. endangered species act.

Pulsed and cw excitations over a wide temperature range are used in order to differentiate between kinetic hole burning (KHB). optical pumping of structural relaxation. and spontaneous relaxation effects. Using these techniques. we are able to correlate changes in the absorption spectrum (band III at ≈ 760 nm) with low-frequency Raman bands. Based on these correlations we are able to determine which proximal heme pocket parameters are participating in KHB and optical pumping phenomena. Differences in the spectra of the ligand specific photoproducts have revealed differences in the populations of conformational substates (CS) that participate in the …,True,BMM7K8QAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC,66,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301010491870768,6172332378942768741,/scholar?cites=6172332378942768741,,,0,0,0

Our studies have demonstrated that E. guineensis exhibits excellent antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo against the bacterial and fungal strains tested. A marked inhibitory effect of the E. guineensis extracts was observed against C. albicans whereby E. guineensis extract at ½. 1. or 2 times the MIC significantly inhibited C. albicans growth with a noticeable drop in optical density (OD) of the bacterial culture. This finding confirmed the anticandidal activity of the extract on C. albicans. Imaging using scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy was done to determine the major alterations in the microstructure of the extract-treated C. albicans. The main abnormalities noted via SEM and TEM studies were the alteration in morphology of the yeast cells.

The syndromes were tested here by asking whether they successfully capture patterns of covariance of floral traits and predict the most common pollinators of flowers.Flowers in six communities from three continents were scored for expression of floral traits used in published descriptions of the pollination syndromes. and simultaneously the pollinators of as many species as possible were characterized.Ordination of …,True,nph0-eMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,401,https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/103/9/1471/145709,6703348887128401943,/scholar?cites=6703348887128401943,,https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/103/9/1471/145709,0,0,0

We experimentally evaluated these effects using the nonrewarding bumblebee‐pollinated orchid Anacamptis morio and associated nectar‐producing plants at a site in Sweden. Pollination success (estimated as pollen receipt and pollen removal) in A. morio was significantly greater for individuals translocated to patches of nectar‐producing plants (Geum rivale and Allium schoenoprasum) than for individuals placed outside (∼20 m away) such patches.

These deceptive plants should benefit from flowering in close proximity to such rewarding plants. because pollinators are locally conditioned on floral signals of the rewarding plants (mimic effect) and because pollinators are more abundant close to rewarding plants (magnet effect). We tested these ideas using the non‐rewarding South African plant Eulophia zeyheriana (Orchidaceae) as a study system. Field observations revealed that E. zeyheriana is pollinated solely by solitary bees belonging to a single species of Lipotriches (Halictidae) that appears to be closely associated with the flowers of Wahlenbergia cuspidata (Campanulaceae). a rewarding plant with which the orchid is often sympatric.

For hermaphrodite plants. self-pollination. either within or among flowers. can reduce mating opportunities because of pollen and ovule discounting and inbreeding depression. Self-pollination may be particularly detrimental in plants such as orchids and asclepiads that package each flower's pollen into one or more pollinia which. together with accessory structures. comprise a pollinarium. Darwin proposed that physical reconfiguration of pollinaria serves as a mechanism for reducing the likelihood of self-pollination. To be effective. the time taken for pollinarium reconfiguration would need to exceed that spent by a pollinator on a plant. We investigated pollinarium reconfiguration (including pollinarium bending. pollinium shrinking and anther cap retention) in 19 species and found a strong positive relationship between reconfiguration time …,True,nph0-eMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,56,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2005.0385,13617440822639489575,/scholar?cites=13617440822639489575,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1617176/,0,0,0

Orchids and asclepiads are particularly at risk as their pollen is packaged as pollinia and so can be deposited on self-stigmas en masse. Many orchids and asclepiads have adaptations to limit self-deposition of pollinia. including gradual reconfiguration of pollinaria following removal. Here an unusual mechanism—anther cap retention—that appears to prevent self-pollination in the South African orchid Eulophia foliosa is examined.• Methods Visits to inflorescences in the field were observed and pollinators collected.

The sub-canopy tree Oxyanthus pyriformis subsp. pyriformis has deep tubular flowers (c. 90 mm in length) that are specialized for pollination by long-tongued hawkmoths. Existing natural populations of this taxon appear to be confined to two suburban habitat fragments in the city of Durban. South Africa.

Floral trait distributions of co-flowering species that share pollinators may reflect the impact of pollinator preference and constancy on their assembly within local communities. While pollinator sharing may lead to increased visitation rates for species with similar flowers. the receipt of foreign pollen via interspecific pollinator movements can decrease seed set.

It will be the first book to document more than 200 of the most important medicinal plants of Central Asia. many whose medicinal uses and activities are being described in English for the first time. The majority of the plants described grow wild in Central Asia with some being endemic. while other species have been introduced to Central Asia but are commonly used in regional plant based medicine. The book contains four introductory chapters. The first and second chapters cover the geography. climate and vegetation of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. respectively. The third chapter provides a brief history of medicinal plant use and science in Central Asia and the fourth chapter contains general information about phytochemistry. The fifth chapter comprises the bulk of the book and covers 208 medicinal plant species. Nearly all species have one or more high quality. color photographs. Three useful appendices have been included. The first is a glossary of botanical and ecological terms. the second is a glossary of chemistry terms and the third is a glossary of medical terms. During the preparation of this manuscript we found there to be a deficiency in quality reference resources for the translation of many of the technical terms associated with the different branches of science covered in this book. In order to make our job easier we compiled glossaries over the course of preparing the manuscript and have included them feeling that they will be an extremely valuable resource for readers.​,True,a9ImJDcAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,82,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=M8AQUwNr5u8C&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:usCZ1tnBdAUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=b17qPs1N5P&sig=jeHFwgyYjigOapU_3QjPAqOllcM,393152208840540346,/scholar?cites=393152208840540346,,,0,0,0

To provide a quantitative insight into the role of this trait. we estimated nuclear DNA content in 93 alien species naturalized in the Czech Republic. belonging to 32 families. by using flow cytometry. and compared it with the values reported for non-invading congeneric and confamilial species from the Plant DNA C-values database. Species naturalized in the Czech Republic have significantly smaller genomes than their congeners not known to be naturalized or invasive in any part of the world. This trend is supported at the family level: alien species naturalized in the Czech flora have on average a smaller genome than is the mean value for non-invading confamilials. Moreover. naturalized and non-invading species clearly differed in the frequency of five genome size categories; this difference was mainly due to very small genomes prevailing and intermediate to very large genomes underrepresented in the former group. Our results provide the first quantitative support for association of genome size with invasiveness. based on a large set of alien species across a number of plant families. However. there was no difference in the genome size of invasive species compared to naturalized but non-invasive. This suggests that small genome size provides alien plants with an advantage already at the stage of naturalization and need not be necessarily associated with the final stage of the process. ie invasion.,True,Cl2YKU8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,140,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.601.843&rep=rep1&type=pdf,4328089224853172305,/scholar?cites=4328089224853172305,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.601.843&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Species were sampled and seed collected in the field from multiple localities in the Czech Republic. Traits related to seed production (propagule number per plant and per population). dispersal (propagule size. length/width ratio and weight; buoyancy; epizoochory; terminal velocity) and establishment (germination; seedling relative growth rate; seedling establishment) were measured for each species either in the field. in a common garden experiment or in the laboratory. Invasive species significantly differ from naturalized non-invasive species in propagule length/width ratio (by having lower ratio. ie more rounded propagules) and fecundity (invasive species are more fecund. both per individual plant and in terms of the population propagule production). Invasive species have proportionally fewer seedlings establishing in the autumn and better capacity for dispersal by wind than non-invasive species. The results for several traits differ depending on whether or not the effect of phylogeny is included in analytical models. Considering species relatedness expressed as a taxonomic hierarchy. invasive species have lighter propagules and higher population propagule numbers. and marginally significantly differ in producing more propagules per plant and having higher capacity for dispersal by water.

We explain plant invasion success. expressed by two measures: invasiveness. i.e. whether the species is naturalized but non-invasive. or invasive; and dominance in plant communities expressed as the mean cover in vegetation plots. We also tested how important reproductive and dispersal traits are in models including other characteristics generally known to predict invasion outcome. such as plant height. life history and residence time. By using regression/classification trees we show that the biological traits affect invasion success at all life stages. from reproduction (seed production) to dispersal (propagule properties). and the ability to compete with resident species (height). By including species traits information not usually available in multispecies analyses. we provide evidence that traits do play important role in determining the outcome of invasion and can be used to distinguish between alien species that reach the final stage of the invasion process and dominate the local communities from those that do not.

1097302,Cytology of the tetraploidAllium ampeloprasum with chiasma localization,1970,AK Koul and RN Gohil,29,Chromosoma,1,12-19,Springer-Verlag, Allium ampeloprasum cultivated in Kashmir is a tetraploid. The somatic complement of the cultivar consists of 32 median or submedian chromosomes. of which 8 have secondary constrictions. The tetraploid karyotype exhibits a great deal of heterozygosity which is taken as an evidence in support of the allopolyploid nature of the species. The tetraploid form is represented by the genomic formula AAA′A″. The three genomes show a great deal of similarity and are therefore taken to represent three varieties which have given rise to this cultivar through hybridity. — Despite this. no multivalents are formed by the species during meiosis. The shift from multivalent to bivalent type of pairing is attributed to the localization of chiasmata around the centromere. This type of chiasmata localization is a means adopted by some polyploid species to stabilize as diploids.,True,_dfYbNUAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC,34,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01183658.pdf,10772569627484587239,/scholar?cites=10772569627484587239,,,0,0,0

Our primary question is whether floristic variation at large scales arises from many gradual changes or a few abrupt ones. Data from 54 1‐ha tree plots along the transect support the latter model. showing two sharp discontinuities in community structure at the genus level. One is located near the Ecuador–Peru border. where the suite of species that dominates large areas of Ecuadorean forest declines abruptly in importance to the east.

In this manuscript. we review studies concerning the cultivation and production of moringa along with genetic diversity among different accessions and populations. Different methods of propagation. establishment and cultivation are discussed. Moringa oleifera shows diversity in many characters and extensive morphological variability. which may provide a resource for its improvement. Great genetic variability is present in the natural and cultivated accessions. but no collection of cultivated and wild accessions currently exists. A germplasm bank encompassing the genetic variability present in Moringa is needed to perform breeding programmes and develop elite varieties adapted to local conditions. Alimentary and medicinal uses of moringa are reviewed. alongside the production of biodiesel. Finally. being that the leaves are the most used part of the plant. their contents in terms of bioactive compounds and their pharmacological properties are discussed. Many studies conducted on cell lines and animals seem concordant in their support for these properties. However. there are still too few studies on humans to recommend Moringa leaves as medication in the prevention or treatment of diseases. Therefore. further studies on humans are recommended.

Despite its importance. the evolutionary history of Vitis is still contentious. Past studies have led to conflicting hypotheses about the phylogeny. speciation events. and biogeographic history of the genus.

The flowers start to develop as hermaphrodites and later become unisexual. In female flowers the stamens degenerate. while in male flowers the ovary stops growing without degenerating. We have examined young asparagus flowers using SEM and optical microscopy in order to determine the exact moment of transition from hermaphroditic to unisexual development. We defined 13 stages of development. starting from flower primordia up to completely mature flowers and labelled them with numbers from -6 to 7. The first five stages are fully hermaphroditic: a difference between sexes becomes visible at stage — 1 when the style begins to develop in female flowers. Degeneration of stamens in female flowers starts somewhat later. At the stage of transition. some differences between sexes also appear in the bidimensional polypeptide pattern of flowers.

Morphological evidence indicates that sex differentiation in Asparagus consists essentially of selective abortion of gynoecium or androecium of initially hermaphroditic floral primordia occurring in genotypically determined male and female individuals. Abortion occurs in pollen-mother cells and anthers in females and in megaspore-mother cells but not in the vegetative tissues of the ovary in males. The differential developmental pathway is accompanied by changes in relative abundance of auxin and cytokinins. The genetic ssytem controlling abortion of male or female organs is apparently monogenic (possibly a bipartite gene) with factor(s) associated with the homomorphic chromosome pair L5.

We explored the relationship between mire species richness and pH. an important environmental variable in mires. in two regions that differ in habitat pH distribution: the West Carpathians and Bulgaria. Mire habitats in both the West Carpathians and Bulgaria demonstrate support for the ESPH prediction that habitats with more common pH values host more species.

These studies demonstrate that several previous concepts about phylogenetic patterns were incorrect. which make all previous classifications in need of review. Therefore. in this paper we describe the emerging patterns and propose a new phylogenetic classification of Orchidaceae that accords with these newly discovered relationships. We recognise five subfamilies: Apostasioideae. Vanilloideae. Cypripedioideae. Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae. the last containing the bulk of the taxa in the family. Apostasioideae are sister to all the rest. followed successively by Vanilloideae. Cypripedioideae and the remainder of the monandrous orchids. Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae.

A recent publication by Garnett and Christidis [1] expressed concerns regarding the difficulty that taxonomic changes represent for conservation efforts and proposed the establishment of a system to govern taxonomic changes. Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects. They also assert that the lack of governance of taxonomy damages conservation efforts. harms the credibility of science. and is costly to society. Despite its fairly recent release.

1097355,Defining the role of fire in south-west Western Australian plants,2003,Kingsley W Dixon and Russell L Barrett,,,,205–223,,Smoke and smoke-like analogues play a key role in the release of deep seed dormancy for a wide variety of geosporous (and three bradysporous) Australian plant species. Heat and ash were thought to be the primary cues for release of dormancy and subsequent germination. It is now known that smoke. applied as an aerosol to unbumt bushland soil containing seeds of geosporous species. or to seeds buried in soil in germination trays. is a key agent in the promotion of germination. In natural bushland sites. application of smoke increased germination 42-(Banksia woodland) to 48-fold (Jarrah-Tuart woodland) greater than the control. In 3 7 species intensively examined in Banksia woodland. only three species (a weedy annual. a legume and Hibbertia amplexicaulis) showed a more promotive effect of the heat/ash of the wildfire than smoke applied to adjacent unburnt vegetation. The action of smoke in releasing dormancy is complex and varies between species-in some cases involving permeation of lipoidal deposits in the sub-testa to denaturing of inhibitor compounds in the seed endosperm and/or embryo.The active principle in smoke is water soluble. acts at extremely low concentrations (nanograms) and is deposited in the soil surface following fire. Rainfall solubilizes the germination-active chemical species. transmitting the chemicals to the soil seed bank in the first 25-50 mm of precipitation. Smoke is therefore a reliable and precise measure of the action of fire in the landscape for germination of geosporous species.

Although pollinators commonly act as selective agents on floral traits. determining the extent to which they have influenced angiosperm diversification requires a historical perspective. Here we review recent studies that combine species-level phylogenies with pollinator data and show that pollinator shifts are common. being associated with at least a quarter of documented divergence events. However. shift frequency and directionality vary extensively. owing to variation in intrinsic factors such as floral features and phylogenetic history. as well as extrinsic factors such as interactions with local pollinator assemblages. Despite technical advances. phylogenies remain limited in their power to distinguish among various pollinator-driven evolutionary processes.,True,at4LHmoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,256,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534712000481,13160896882579306067,/scholar?cites=13160896882579306067,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Timotheus_Van_Der_Niet/publication/259720090_Pollinator-driven_ecological_speciation_in_plants_New_evidence_and_future_perspectives/links/578780c008aecf56ebcb422d.pdf,0,0,0

Mounting evidence indicates that pollinators have the potential to drive diversification at several different stages of the evolutionary process. Microevolutionary studies have provided evidence for pollinator-mediated floral adaptation. while macroevolutionary evidence supports a general pattern of pollinator-driven diversification of angiosperms. However. the overarching issue of whether. and how. shifts in pollination system drive plant speciation represents a critical gap in knowledge. Bridging this gap is crucial to fully understand whether pollinator-driven microevolution accounts for the observed macroevolutionary patterns.

Guatteria (Annonaceae) is. with 265 species. the third largest genus of Neotropical trees after Inga (Fabaceae) and Ocotea (Lauraceae). and its widespread distribution and frequent occurrence makes the genus an excellent model taxon to study diversification patterns. This study reconstructed the phylogeny of Guatteria and inferred three major biogeographical events in the history of the genus: (1) a trans-oceanic Miocene migration from Central into South America before the closing of the Isthmus of Panama; (2) a major diversification of the lineage within South America; and (3) several migrations of South American lineages back into Central America via the closed Panamanian …,True,at4LHmoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,125,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790307000516,15003650188793946870,/scholar?cites=15003650188793946870,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30726069/Erkens_etal_MolPhylEvol_2007.pdf,0,0,0

Reproductive isolation can evolve either as a by‐product of divergent selection or through reinforcement. We used the Cape flora of South Africa. known for its high level of pollination specialization. as a model system to test the potential role of shifts in pollination system in the speciation process. Comparative analysis of 41 sisterspecies pairs (representing Geraniaceae. Iridaceae. and Orchidaceae) for which complete pollinator. edaphic. and distribution data are available showed that for sister species with overlapping distribution ranges. pollination system shifts are significantly associated with edaphic shifts.

1097386,Patterns of plant speciation in the Cape floristic region,2009,Timotheüs van der Niet and Steven D Johnson,51,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,1,85-93,Academic Press,Plant species have accumulated in the Cape region of southern Africa to a much greater degree than in areas of equivalent size in the rest of the subcontinent. Although this could be a consequence simply of lower extinction rates in the Cape. most researchers have invoked high rates of ecological speciation. driven by unique aspects of the Cape environment. as the primary explanation for this richness. To assess these ideas. we analyzed the frequencies of ecological shifts among 188 sister species pairs obtained from molecular phylogenies of eight Cape clades. Ecological shifts were evident in 80% of sister species pairs. with general habitat. pollinator. and fire-survival strategy shifts being especially frequent. Contrary to an established idea that shifts in soil type are frequently associated with speciation of Cape taxa. these shifts were relatively rare. occurring in just 17% of species pairs.

Heritable epigenetic variation mediates between relatively slowly accumulating mutations in the DNA sequence and ephemeral adaptive responses to stress. thereby providing mechanisms for achieving stable. but potentially rapidly evolving phenotypic diversity as a response to environmental stimuli. This suggests that heritable epigenetic signals can play an important role in evolutionary processes. but so far this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. A promising new area of research focuses on the interaction between the different molecular levels that produce phenotypic variation in wild. closely-related taxa that lack genome-wide genetic differentiation. By pinpointing specific adaptive traits and investigating the mechanisms responsible for phenotypic differentiation. such study systems could allow profound insights into the role of epigenetics in the evolution and stabilization of phenotypic discontinuities. and could add to our understanding of adaptive strategies to diverse environmental conditions and their dynamics.,True,MvatzbYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,55,https://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/698421.pdf,352689982200569212,/scholar?cites=352689982200569212,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/698421.pdf,0,0,0

The addition of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to the reaction mixtures overcame the presence of reaction inhibitors present in fungal and root cells. and enabled the amplification of the ITS regions directly from ectomycorrhizal tissues. This method is cheaper and less time-consuming than conventional procedures. and reduces the time required from 1-4 h to a few minutes. It is also much more sensitive. allowing the identification of just a small fragment of a mycorrhizal root tip. Because of this it is possible to select only the target fungal tissue and hence minimise the risk of contamination by saprobic or other mycorrhizal species.

This area is typical of many arid zone grazing areas. comprising sparse vegetation and highly reflective soils. These two factors were found to severely limit the usefulness of satellite-derived vegetation indices that are frequently used to map and monitor vegetation in more temperate areas. Furthermore. the relationship between vegetation indices and percentage vegetation cover was found to be site-specific. thus reducing their application for large-scale vegetation monitoring. As an alternative. a hybrid geometric optical/empirically based model was developed for the area. This was based on the illumination geometry and reflectance values from the red and near-infrared scattergram of the satellite images.

Trieste (NE Italy),2012,Ilaria Bruni and Fabrizio De Mattia and Stefano Martellos and Andrea Galimberti and Paolo Savadori and Maurizio Casiraghi and Pier Luigi Nimis and Massimo Labra,7,PloS one,9,e43256,Public Library of Science,Background Identification keys are decision trees which require the observation of one or more morphological characters of an organism at each step of the process. While modern digital keys can overcome several constraints of classical paper-printed keys. their performance is not error-free. Moreover. identification cannot be always achieved when a specimen lacks some morphological features (i.e. because of season. incomplete development or miss-collecting). DNA barcoding was proven to have great potential in plant identification. while it can be ineffective with some closely related taxa. in which the relatively brief evolutionary distance did not produce differences in the core-barcode sequences.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper. we investigated how the DNA barcoding can support the modern digital approaches to the identification of organisms. using as a case study a local flora. that of Mt. Valerio. a small hill near the centre of Trieste (NE Italy). The core barcode markers (plastidial rbcL and matK). plus the additional trnH-psbA region. were used to identify vascular plants specimens. The usefulness of DNA barcoding data in enhancing the performance of a digital identification key was tested on three independent simulated scenarios.   Conclusions/Significance Our results show that the core barcode markers univocally identify most species of our local flora (96%). The trnH-psbA data improve the discriminating power of DNA barcoding among closely related plant taxa. In the multiparametric digital key.

For each habitat. a list of species was obtained (`virtual relevé'). A matrix of real and virtual relevés was submitted to classification and ordination. obtaining six main community-types. all of which include both real and virtual relevés. Two ordinations of species were carried out. one on the matrix of real relevés. the other on that of virtual relevés: their comparison shows that the consistency and the resolving power of the indicator values was high. but it also permits to detect and correct some errors.

Although numerous metrics are purported to quantify the quality of RNA. there have been no large-scale empirical evaluations of the major determinants of sequencing success. We used a combination of existing and newly developed methods to isolate total RNA from 1115 samples from 695 plant species in 324 families. which represents >900 million years of phylogenetic diversity from green algae through flowering plants. including many plants of economic importance. We then sequenced 629 of these samples on Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq platforms and performed a large comparative analysis to identify predictors of RNA quality and the diversity of putative genes (scaffolds) expressed within samples. Tissue types (e.g.. leaf vs. flower) varied in RNA quality. sequencing depth and the number of scaffolds. Tissue age also influenced RNA quality but not the number of scaffolds ≥1000 bp. Overall. 36% of the variation in the number of scaffolds was explained by metrics of RNA integrity (RIN score). RNA purity (OD 260/230). sequencing platform (GAIIx vs HiSeq) and the amount of total RNA used for sequencing. However. our results show that the most commonly used measures of RNA quality (e.g.. RIN) are weak predictors of the number of scaffolds because Illumina sequencing is robust to variation in RNA quality.

Wagner (1970) argued that while polyploids have always existed. they have never diversified or played a major role in the evolution of plants. and that the study of polyploidy (as well as inbreeding. apomixis. and hybridization) has led researchers to be ‘carried away with side branches and blind alleys that go nowhere’.

1097476,Genome Mining of Plant NPFs Reveals Varying Conservation of Signature Motifs Associated With the Mechanism of Transport,2018,Antonella Longo and Nicholas W Miles and Rebecca Dickstein,9,Frontiers in plant science,,,Frontiers Media SA,Nitrogen is essential for all living species and may be taken up from the environment in different forms like nitrate or peptides. In plants. members of a transporter family named NPFs transport nitrate and peptides across biological membranes. NPFs are phylogenetically related to a family of peptide transporters (PTRs) or proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) that are evolutionarily conserved in all organisms except in Archaea. POTs are present in low numbers in bacteria. algae and animals. NPFs have expanded in plants and evolved to transport a wide range of substrates including phytohormones and glucosinolates. Functional studies have shown that most NPFs. like POTs. operate as symporters with simultaneous inwardly directed movement of protons. Here we focus on four structural features of NPFs/POTs/PTRs that have been shown by structural and functional studies to be essential to proton-coupled symport transport. The first two features are implicated in proton binding and transport: a conserved motif named ExxER/K. located in the first transmembrane helix (TMH1) and a D/E residue in TMH7 that has been observed in some bacterial and algal transporters. The third and fourth features are two inter-helical salt bridges between residues on TMH1 and TMH7 or TMH4 and TMH10. To understand if the mechanism of transport is conserved in NPFs with the expansion to novel substrates. we collected NPFs sequences from 42 plant genomes. Sequence alignment revealed that the ExxER/K motif is not strictly conserved and its conservation level is different in the NPF subfamilies.

1097480,Modelos de distribución de especies: Una revisión sintética,2011,Rubén G Mateo and Ángel M Felicísimo and Jesús Muñoz,84,,2,217-240,Sociedad de Biología de Chile,En los últimos años se ha generalizado una nueva herramienta que permite analizar objetivamente los patrones espaciales de presencia de organismos: los modelos de distribución de especies. Estos modelos se basan en procedimientos estadísticos y cartográficos que partiendo de datos reales de presencia permiten inferir zonas potencialmente idóneas en función de sus características ambientales. Los datos de colecciones de historia natural pueden ser utilizados para este fin adquiriendo así una nueva utilidad. Los modelos han evolucionado desde su aplicación a especies aisladas hasta análisis de cientos o miles de taxones para combinarlos en el análisis de la biodiversidad y riqueza específica.

Generating reliable species distribution models using pseudo‐absences and target‐group absences from natural history collections,2010,Rubén G Mateo and Thomas B Croat and Ángel M Felicísimo and Jesus Munoz,16,Diversity and Distributions,1,84-94,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Aim The presence‐only data stored in natural history collections is the most important source of information available regarding the distribution of organisms. These data and profile techniques can be used to generate species distribution models (SDMs). but pseudo‐absences must be generated to use group discriminative techniques. In this study. we evaluated whether the SDMs generated with pseudo‐absences are reliable and also if there are differences in the results obtained with profile and group discriminative techniques. Location Ecuador. South America. Methods The SDMs were generated with a training data set for each of the five species of Anthurium and six different methods: two profile techniques (BIOCLIM and Gower’s distance index). three group discriminative techniques [logistic multiple regression (LMR). multivariate adaptative regression splines (MARS) and Maxent] and a mixed modelling …,True,UCbc-tAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,155,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00617.x,10497631397943560767,/scholar?cites=10497631397943560767,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00617.x,0,0,0

1097483,Impact of model complexity on cross-temporal transferability in Maxent species distribution models: An assessment using paleobotanical data,2015,Elena Moreno-Amat and Rubén G Mateo and Diego Nieto-Lugilde and Naia Morueta-Holme and Jens-Christian Svenning and Ignacio García-Amorena,312,Ecological Modelling,,308-317,Elsevier,Maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) is a widely used algorithm for predicting species distributions across space and time. Properly assessing the uncertainty in such predictions is non-trivial and requires validation with independent datasets. Notably. model complexity (number of model parameters) remains a major concern in relation to overfitting and. hence. transferability of Maxent models. An emerging approach is to validate the cross-temporal transferability of model predictions using paleoecological data. In this study. we assess the effect of model complexity on the performance of Maxent projections across time using two European plant species (Alnus glutinosa (L.)

Investigating species richness (SR) patterns of European land plants. we determine whether SR increases with decreasing latitude. as predicted by theory and whether the assembly mechanisms differ among taxonomic groups. SR increases towards the south in spermatophytes. but towards the north in ferns and bryophytes. SR patterns in spermatophytes are consistent with their patterns of beta diversity. with high levels of nestedness and turnover in the north and in the south. respectively. indicating species exclusion towards the north and increased opportunities for speciation in the south. Liverworts exhibit the highest levels of nestedness. suggesting that they represent the most sensitive group to the impact of past climate change.

We modelled the distribution of the species in the Anthurium genus (53 species) and the Bromeliaceae family (89 species) using six modelling techniques. We combined all of the predictions for the same species in ensemble models based on two different criteria: the average of the rescaled predictions by all techniques and the average of the best techniques. The rescaled predictions were then reclassified into binary predictions (presence/absence). By stacking either the original predictions or binary predictions for both ensemble procedures. we obtained four different species richness models per taxa. The gamma and alpha diversity per elevation band (500 m) was also computed. To evaluate the prediction abilities for the four predictions of species richness and gamma diversity. the models were compared with the real data along an elevation gradient that was independently compiled by specialists. Finally. we also tested whether our richness models performed better than a null model of altitudinal changes of diversity based on the literature. Stacking of the ensemble prediction of the individual species models generated richness models that proved to be well correlated with the observed alpha diversity richness patterns along elevation and with the gamma diversity derived from the literature. Overall. these models tend to overpredict species richness.

Brazil is home to 32.086 native Angiosperms and 23 native Gymnosperms. showing an increase of 3% in its species richness in relation to 2010. The Amazon Rainforest is the richest Brazilian biome for Gymnosperms. while the Atlantic Rainforest is the richest one for Angiosperms. There was a considerable increment in the number of species and endemism rates for biomes. except for the Amazon that showed a decrease of 2.5% of recorded endemics. However. well over half of Brazillian seed plant species (57.4%) is endemic to this territory. The proportion of life-forms varies among different biomes: trees are more expressive in the Amazon and Atlantic Rainforest biomes while herbs predominate in the Pampa. and lianas are more expressive in the Amazon.

1097521,Divergent genetic mechanisms underlie reversals to radial floral symmetry from diverse zygomorphic flowered ancestors,2013,Wenheng Zhang and Victor W Steinmann and Lachezar Nikolov and Elena M Kramer and Charles Davis,4,Frontiers in Plant Science,,302,Frontiers,Malpighiaceae possess flowers with a unique bilateral symmetry (zygomorphy). which is a hypothesized adaptation associated with specialization on neotropical oil bee pollinators. Gene expression of two representatives of the CYC2 lineage of floral symmetry TCP genes. CYC2A and CYC2B. demarcate the adaxial (dorsal) region of the flower in the characteristic zygomorphic flowers of most Malpighiaceae. Several clades within the family. however. have independently lost their specialized oil bee pollinators and reverted to radial flowers (actinomorphy) like their ancestors. Here. we investigate CYC2 expression associated with four independent reversals to actinomorphy. We demonstrate that these reversals are always associated with alteration of the highly conserved CYC2 expression pattern observed in most New World Malpighiaceae. In New World Lasiocarpus and Old World Microsteria. the expression of CYC2-like genes has expanded to include the ventral region of the corolla. Thus. the pattern of gene expression in these species has become radialized. which is comparable to what has been reported in the radial flowered legume clade Cadia. In striking contrast. in New World Psychopterys and Old World Sphedamnocarpus. CYC2-like expression is entirely absent or at barely detectable levels. This is more similar to the pattern of CYC2 expression observed in radial flowered Arabidopsis. These results collectively indicate that. regardless of geographic distribution. reversals to similar floral phenotypes in this large tropical angiosperm clade have evolved via different genetic changes from an otherwise highly conserved developmental …,True,DomW03UAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,37,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2013.00302/full,14356183059553201914,/scholar?cites=14356183059553201914,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2013.00302/full,0,0,0

Very evident is the climate change. which has resulted in a southward shift of the climate zones. e.g. a spread of the desert (Sahara) into the Sahelian zone. After the drought period of the early 1970s and 1980s. livestock density increased resulting in an intensification of grazing pressure.

Although many-flowered plants attracted most bumblebees these plants received fewer visits on a per flower basis than smaller plants. and each bumblebee visited a smaller proportion of the flowers. The calculated effective visitation rate per flower was highest on plants of an intermediate size.

The visitation rate did not increase disproportionately with inflorescence size. as would be expected if clusters of heads had a synergetic effect on pollinator attraction. Both the calculated visitation rate per head and the percentage seed set increased slightly as a function of head number. The removal of rays from all heads in the inflorescence reduced the approach rate by 51%. but had only a small negative effect on seed set (12%).

Parent-offspring analyses of two populations of N. degenii demonstrated high heritabilities for a wide range of vegetative and floral characters. indicating a great potential for further adaptive change. The populations differed significantly in the heritability for leaf length and in the genetic correlation between plant height and peduncle length. suggesting that these populations would respond differently to identical selection pressures. There was a tendency for large-scale diversity to extrapolate within-population variability. at least for the floral trait associations. while genetic data from a segregating F3 hybrid population indicated stability in the correlation structure across two environments. On the basis of hybrid data.

Using hybrid poplar (Populus tremula × Populus alba). we applied this strategy and examined field-grown transformants for both effects on wood biochemistry and tree productivity. The reductions in lignin contents obtained correlated well with 4CL RNA expression. with a sharp decrease in lignin amount being observed for RNA expression below approximately 50% of the nontransgenic control.

Transgenic events had different levels of down‐regulation of two genes encoding 4‐coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL). Two‐year‐old trees were characterized after growing either as free‐standing trees in the field or as supported by stakes in a greenhouse. In free‐standing trees. a 20 to 40% reduction in lignin content was associated with increased xylem vulnerability to embolism. shoot dieback and mortality. In staked trees. the decreased biomechanical demands on the xylem was associated with increases in the leaf area to sapwood area ratio and wood specific conductivity (ks). and with decreased leaf‐specific conductivity (kl).

The bamboo allowed large flexural deformation since its outer layer retains the tensile stress while the softer inner layer undergoes large compressive deformation. The results suggested that the combination of the fiber-rich outer part and the compressible inner part was responsible for the flexural ductility of split bamboo. To clarify the compressible nature of the inner part of bamboo. the longitudinal surfaces of the bamboo and wood specimens were microscopically observed before and after a large longitudinal compression. Although the wood specimens showed serious and localized buckling. the inner part of the bamboo specimens showed no such visible buckling. In the latter case. the foam-like parenchyma cells absorbed the large compressive deformation by their microscopic buckling and …,True,iHz5_kkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,120,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00226-007-0127-8.pdf,13515515908018748780,/scholar?cites=13515515908018748780,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48577626/Bending_characteristics_of_bamboo_Phyll20160904-6370-1mfuucz.pdf,0,0,0

To achieve reproductive success. plants must select the most favourable season to initiate reproductive development; this in turn requires continuous monitoring of environmental factors and a properly response. Environmental factors which change in a predictable fashion along the year. such as light and temperature. are the most relevant in terms of selection of the flowering season. In Arabidopsis and more recently in a few other species. molecular genetic analyses are providing a way to identify the genes involved in the regulation of flowering time. From gene sequences it is possible to develop hypotheses regarding molecular function and to infer some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the environmental regulation of flowering time. In this paper. we summarize recent discoveries concerning the mechanisms which plants use to perceive and respond to major environmental factors (light and temperature) and their different components. We focus mainly on annual plants and especially on Arabidopsis because most of the available molecular and functional data come from this species.

Unfortunately many species in several tropical regions remain unstudied. The purpose of this paper is to describe the floral biology. the nature of self‐incompatibility. morph ratios. and fecundity in natural populations of Gaertnera vaginata. a small tree endemic to the island of La Réunion in the Indian Ocean.

The objectives of this paper are to quantify (a) whether Chassalia corallioides. a small tree endemic to La Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. is another example of the evolution of dioecy from distyly and (b) whether reproductive traits linked to male and female function vary over the ecological distribution of this species. Quantification of pollen production and fruit set following controlled and natural pollinations demonstrate that this species is dioecious. Male flowers have longer corolla tubes than female flowers. Female flowers have long styles with stigmas placed above the anthers whereas males have short styles with stigmas placed below the anthers.

They were usually considered to associate with fungi that are (1) specific of each mycoheterotrophic species and (2) mycorrhizal on surrounding green plants. which are the ultimate carbon source of the entire system. We review here recent works unravelling that some mycoheterotrophic plants are not fungal-specific. and that some mycoheterotrophic orchids associate with saprophytic fungi. A re-examination of ancient data suggests that lower specificity may be less rare than supposed in mycoheterotrophic plants. Association between mycoheterotrophic orchids and saprophytic fungi arose several times in the evolution of the two partners. We speculate that this indirectly illustrates why transition from saprotrophy to mycorrhizal status is common in fungal evolution.

With deforestation advancing quickly. protected areas are increasingly becoming final refuges for threatened species and natural ecosystem processes. However. many protected areas in the tropics are themselves vulnerable to human encroachment and other environmental stresses4–9. As pressures mount. it is vital to know whether existing reserves can sustain their biodiversity. A critical constraint in addressing this question has been that data describing a broad array of biodiversity groups have been unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative sample of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set on changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change. for 60 protected areas stratified across the world’s major tropical regions. Our analysis reveals great variation in reserve ‘health’: about half of all reserves have been effective or performed passably. but the rest are experiencing an erosion of biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread taxonomically and functionally. Habitat disruption. hunting and forest-product exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining reserve health. Crucially. environmental changes immediately outside reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in determining their ecological fate. with changes inside reserves strongly mirroring those occurring around them.

Only recently. there is an increasing recognition that integrating these two questions offers new insights into the mechanisms of biological invasions. This recognition has renewed the interest in two long‐standing and seemingly contradictory hypotheses proposed by Darwin: phylogenetic relatedness of invaders to native communities is predicted to promote naturalization because of appropriate niche‐adaptation but is at the same time predicted to hamper naturalization because of niche overlap with native species. The latter is known as Darwin’s naturalization hypothesis.Location  Global.Methods and Results  We review the studies that have tested these hypotheses and summarize their largely inconsistent outcomes.

1097655,Two inducers of plant defense responses. 2. 6-dichloroisonicotinec acid and salicylic acid. inhibit catalase activity in tobacco,1995,Uwe Conrath and Zhixiang Chen and Joseph R Ricigliano and Daniel F Klessig,92,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,16,7143-7147,National Academy of Sciences,2.6-Dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) and salicylic acid (SA) are potent inducers of plant defense responses including the synthesis of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and the development of enhanced disease resistance. A soluble SA-binding protein has been purified from tobacco with an affinity and specificity of binding that suggest it is a SA receptor. Recently. this protein has been shown to be a catalase whose enzymatic activity is inhibited by SA binding. We have proposed that the resulting increase in intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species plays a role in the induction of defense responses such as PR protein gene expression. Here we report that INA. like SA. binds the SA-binding protein/catalase and inhibits its enzymatic activity. In fact. the dose-response curves for inhibition of catalase by these two compounds are similar.

We derived eleven soil groups from numerical analysis of the national data. three of which were confined to the island State of Tasmania and ten of which clearly fitted in one of the organosol. dermosol or rudosol soil orders. Linear mixed models indicated that climate. parent material. topographic position. and vegetation type are all important in influencing alpine soil at a national scale in Australia.

The timing of annual snowmelt is considered an important determinant of vegetation patterns in alpine areas because it affects the length of the growing season for plant species at landscape scales. There are few studies in Australia that have examined the effects of the date of snowmelt on the performance of plant species at small spatial scales. The phytomass and phenology of three common snowpatch species (Celmisia pugioniformis. Luzula acutifolia. Poa fawcettiae) was examined during one growing season across a natural snowmelt gradient to examine their response to time of snow release. Peak phytomass was significantly higher in early than late-melting zones for L. acutifolia and marginally higher there for C. pugioniformis.

At high altitudes. facilitative interactions between close neighboring plants may buffer seedlings from these abiotic pressures by providing shelter from frosts and winds. At lower altitudes. seedlings may not be so limited by the abiotic environment. and may therefore compete for resources with close neighboring plants. Using four alpine sites at different elevations (representing an abiotic stress gradient). we investigated how the presence of close neighboring plants influences seedling growth in their first growing season. We experimentally cleared above-ground vegetation and transplanted seedlings of three species into cleared and control plots. We quantified the stress gradient of abiotic conditions across sites by measuring ambient and soil temperatures. soil moisture. and soil …,True,6MWiGZMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,26,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1657/1938-4246-41.3.381,940973503650205893,/scholar?cites=940973503650205893,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1657/1938-4246-41.3.381,0,0,0

Recent initiatives started ambitious preservation plans to digitize this information and make it available to botanists and the general public through web portals. However. thousands of sheets are still unidentified at the species level while numerous sheets should be reviewed and updated following more recent taxonomic knowledge. These annotations and revisions require an unrealistic amount of work for botanists to carry out in a reasonable time. Computer vision and machine learning approaches applied to herbarium sheets are promising but are still not well studied compared to automated species identification from leaf scans or pictures of plants in the field. In this work. we propose to study and evaluate the accuracy with which herbarium images can be potentially exploited for species identification with deep learning technology. In addition. we propose to study if the combination of herbarium sheets with photos of plants in the field is relevant in terms of accuracy. and finally. we explore if herbarium images from one region that has one specific flora can be used to do transfer learning to another region with other species; for example. on a region under-represented in terms of collected data. This is. to our knowledge. the first study that uses deep learning to analyze a big dataset with thousands of species from herbaria.

A common goal in managing a botanical living collection is to maintain the greatest biodiversity at the greatest economic and logistic efficiency. However to date there is no unified strategy for managing living plants within and among botanic gardens. We propose a strategy that combines three indicators of the management priority of a collection: information on species imperilment. genetic representation. and the operational costs associated to maintaining genetic representation.

Cycads constitute the most imperiled major group of plants. and ex situ collections are an important part of conservation planning for this group. given seed recalcitrance. difficulties with tissue culture. and ongoing in situ threats. Very little is known about the genetics of ex situ conservation collections of cycads. Thus. this study seeks to illuminate how well an ex situ collection of a cycad can capture the diversity in a wild population.Methodology. A model species. Zamia decumbens. was chosen on the basis of geographic isolation and detailed census knowledge. which allowed near-total sampling of in situ plants.

The situation has aggravated due to the drastic and rapid changes in global climate. Heat and drought stress are undoubtedly the two most important stresses having huge impact on growth and productivity of the crops. It is very important to understand the physiological. biochemical and ecological interventions related to these stresses for better management. A wide range of plant responses to these stresses could be generalized into morphological. physiological and biochemical responses. Interestingly. this review provides a detailed account of plant responses to heat and drought stresses with special focus on highlighting the commonalities and differences. Crop growth and yields are negatively affected by sub-optimal water supply and abnormal temperatures due to physical damages. physiological disruptions and biochemical changes. Both these stresses have multi-lateral impacts and therefore. complex in mechanistic action. A better understanding of plant responses to these stresses has pragmatic implication for remedies and management. A comprehensive account of conventional as well as modern approaches to deal with heat and drought stresses have also been presented here. A side-by-side critical discussion on salient responses and management strategies for these two important abiotic stresses provides a unique insight into the phenomena.

In the present study. we investigated the role of externally applied hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in regulating the antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems in conferring cadmium (Cd)-induced oxidative stress tolerance in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). Seedlings were pretreated with 50 μM H2O2 for 24 h. These pretreated seedlings as well as non-pretreated seedlings were grown for another 48 h at two concentrations of CdCl2 (0.5 and 1.0 mM). Both the levels of Cd increased MDA and H2O2 levels and LOX (lipoxygenase) activity while ascorbate (AsA) declined significantly. However. reduced glutathione (GSH) content showed an increase at 0.5 mM CdCl2. but glutathione disulfide (GSSG) increased at any level of Cd with a decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio.

However. not much has been done to evaluate the role or effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) in regulating physiological and biochemical processes in response to salt-induced stress. For this purpose. some callus growth traits. plant regeneration rate. mineral element (sodium. potassium. phosphorous and nitrogen) contents and changes in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in tissues of five tomato cultivars were investigated in a callus culture exposed to elevated concentrations of salt (3.0 and 6.0 g L-1 NaCl). and in the presence of zinc oxide nanoparticles (15 and 30 mg L-1). The relative callus growth rate was inhibited by 3.0 g L-1 NaCl; this was increased dramatically at 6.0 g L-1. Increasing exposure to NaCl was associated with a significantly higher sodium content and SOD and GPX activities. Zinc oxide nanoparticles mitigated the effects of NaCl. and in this application of lower concentrations (15 mg L-1) was more effective than a higher concentration (30 mg L-1). This finding indicates that zinc oxide nanoparticles should be investigated further as a potential anti-stress agent in crop production.

Given the spatial extent of unprotected forests. finding management approaches that will sustain their multiple environmental. economic. and cultural values and prevent their conversion to other uses is imperative. The major global challenge of native forest management is further demonstrated by ongoing steep declines in forest biodiversity and carbon stocks. Here. we suggest that an essential part of such management—supplementing the protection of large reserves and sensitive areas within forest landscapes (e.g.. aquatic features)—is the adoption of the retention approach in forests where logging occurs.

A key argument was that logging in wet forests results in drier forests that tend to be more fire‐prone. and this argument has gained prominence both in the literature and in policy debate. We find no support for that argument from considerations of eucalypt stand development. and from reanalysis of the only Australian study cited by Lindenmayer et al.

The study was carried out on Hyparrhenia hirta (L.) Stapf (Hh) grassland and Ampelodesmos mauritanicus (Desf.) T. Durand & Schinz (Am) grasslands located in the north of Sicily. Soil samples were collected at 0–5 cm before and after the experimental fire. and SOC was measured. During the grassland fire. soil surface temperature was monitored. Biomass of both grasses was analysed in order to determine dry weight and its chemical composition. The results showed that SOC varied significantly with vegetation type. while it is not affected in the short term by grassland fire. Am grassland stored more SOC compared with Hh grassland thanks to lower content in the biomass of the labile carbon pool. No significant difference was observed in SOC before and after fire. which could be caused by several factors: first. in both grassland types the measured soil temperature during fire was low due to thin litter layers; second. in a semiarid environment. a higher mineralization rate results in a lower soil carbon labile pool; and third. the SOC stored in the finest soil fractions. physically protected. is not affected by fire.,True,EGO2A5cAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC,35,https://se.copernicus.org/articles/4/381/2013/,17175995577271075375,/scholar?cites=17175995577271075375,,https://se.copernicus.org/articles/4/381/2013/se-4-381-2013.pdf,0,0,0

Here we test the hypothesis that the timing of vegetation change was synchronous on a sub-continental scale. which implies a common trigger or a step-like change in climate parameters.

Paris (FRA),The role of the Cornmon Opossum. Didelphis aurita. as an effective seed disperser for Solanaceous plants was studied in a forest fragment of southem Brazil for two years. Opossums were captured once per week to collect feces and to find seeds of these plants. Seeds were then tested for germination rates. The trapping locations allowed estimations of minimum dispersal distances to source plants for the species of seeds found in their feces. Opossums feces contained mainly seeds of six species of Solanaceous plants. The average number of seeds in scats varied among species and ranged from 9 to 33.

In this review. the historical development of hybrid research is outlined. followed by a discussion and rebuttal of traditional assumptions of hybrid evolution like reduced fitness. rarity. intermediate character inheritance etc. The potential of hybridization for plant evolution is presented and factors for and effects of reticulate evolution are examined. Four topics are then focused on current that are underrepresented in the those discussion. but which look promising for future research: (1) Biosymmetry. a new concept of ‘masked asymmetry'; (2) unequal ancient splits and macroevolutionary hypercycles; (3) genome evolution; and (4) phylogenetic reconstruction in mixed species.

We used airborne imaging spectroscopy and lidar (light detection and ranging) to quantify changes in three-dimensional forest structure and canopy functional traits in twenty 25 ha landscapes distributed along a 3300 m elevation gradient from lowland Amazonia to treeline in the Peruvian Andes. Elevation was positively correlated with lidar-estimated canopy gap density and understory vegetation cover. and negatively related to canopy height and the vertical partitioning of vegetation in canopies. Increases in canopy gap density were tightly linked to increases in understory plant cover. and larger gaps (20–200 m2) produced 25–30 times the response in understory cover than did smaller gaps (< 5 m2). Vegetation NDVI and photosynthetic fractional cover decreased. while exposed non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil increased. with elevation.

1097837,Hawaiian native forest conserves water relative to timber plantation: species and stand traits influence water use,2009,Aurora Kagawa and Lawren Sack and Ka ‘eo Duarte and Shelley James,19,Ecological Applications,6,1429-1443,Ecological Society of America,Tropical forests are becoming increasingly alien‐dominated through the establishment of timber plantations and secondary forests. Despite widespread recognition that afforestation results in increased evapotranspiration and lower catchment yields. little is known of the impacts of timber plantations on water balance relative to native forest. Native forest trees have been claimed to use water conservatively and enhance groundwater recharge relative to faster‐growing alien species. and this argument should motivate native forest preservation and restoration. However. data have been available primarily for leaf‐level gas exchange rather than for whole‐plant and stand levels. We measured sap flow of dominant tree and tree fern species over eight weeks in native Metrosideros polymorpha forest and adjacent alien timber plantations on the island of Hawai‘i and estimated total stand transpiration.

Bracteoles are small. reduced leaves borne close to the base of lateral branches. Although they seem unimportant in older buds. they have an ecological function in protecting the sepal primordia. Furthermore. a morphogenetic function in mediating the onset of sepal initiation is suspected in the literature. The occurrence of bracteoles varies within Papilionoideae. and their distribution is used in legume systematics. But this is open to criticism. because there is a tendency to use ‘absent’ for ‘caducous’.

Cycads constitute the most imperiled major group of plants. and ex situ collections are an important part of conservation planning for this group. given seed recalcitrance. difficulties with tissue culture. and ongoing in situ threats. Very little is known about the genetics of ex situ conservation collections of cycads. Thus. this study seeks to illuminate how well an ex situ collection of a cycad can capture the diversity in a wild population.Methodology. A model species.

The effect of the imidazolium substituent on the catalytic efficiency has been also considered. The thermodynamic analysis has indicated that enthalpy rules styrene oxidation when catalysts Mn(Porph)-1 and Mn(Porph)-2 are used whereas the entropy is the driven force for Mn(Porph)-3 and Mn(Porph)-4 catalyzed reactions. Interestingly. an enthalpy–entropy compensation phenomenon is observed when comparing the thermodynamic results obtained for catalysts Mn(Porph)-3 and Mn(Porph)-4. Hammett plots for the studied manganese porphyrins provided small ρ-values. and this is typical for multi-step reactions. indicating that there is no significant charge separation in the transition state.

Chenopodium (Amaranthaceae) is a globally distributed genus composed of approximately 50–75 species. The genus includes several polyploid species. some of which are considered noxious agricultural weeds. and a few are domesticated crops. Very little research has addressed their evolutionary origin to date. We construct a phylogeny for Chenopodium based on two introns of the single‐copy nuclear locus Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) to clarify the relationships among the genomes of the allotetraploid and allohexaploid species. and to help identify their genome donors.• Methods: Diploid species were sequenced directly. whereas homeologous sequences of polyploid genomes were first separated by plasmid‐mediated cloning.

1097897,The role of Na+ and K+ transporters in salt stress adaptation in glycophytes,2017,Dekoum VM Assaha and Akihiro Ueda and Hirofumi Saneoka and Rashid Al-Yahyai and Mahmoud W Yaish,8,,,509,Frontiers,Ionic stress is one of the most important components of salinity and is brought about by excess Na+ accumulation. especially in the aerial parts of plants. Since Na+ interferes with K+ homeostasis. and especially given its involvement in numerous metabolic processes. maintaining a balanced cytosolic Na+/K+ ratio has become a key salinity tolerance mechanism. Achieving this homeostatic balance requires the activity of Na+ and K+ transporters and/or channels. The mechanism of Na+ and K+ uptake and translocation in glycophytes and halophytes is essentially the same. but glycophytes are more susceptible to ionic stress than halophytes. The transport mechanisms involve Na+ and/or K+ transporters and channels as well as non-selective cation channels. Thus. the question arises of whether the difference in salt tolerance between glycophytes and halophytes could be the result of differences in the proteins or in the expression of genes coding the transporters. The aim of this review is to seek answers to this question by examining the role of major Na+ and K+ transporters and channels in Na+ and K+ uptake. translocation and intracellular homeostasis in glycophytes. It turns out that these transporters and channels are equally important for the adaptation of glycophytes as they are for halophytes. but differential gene expression. structural differences in the proteins (single nucleotide substitutions. impacting affinity) and post-translational modifications (phosphorylation) account for the differences in their activity and hence the differences in tolerance between the two groups.

Only recently. investigators have uncovered microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation. which is critical for typical plant development and adaptation to stress conditions such as salinity. To identify conserved and novel miRNAs in date palm and to characterise miRNAs that could play a role in salt tolerance. we have generated sRNA libraries from the leaves and roots of NaCl-treated and untreated seedlings of date palm. Deep sequencing of these four sRNA libraries yielded approximately 251 million reads. The bioinformatics analysis has identified 153 homologs of conserved miRNAs. 89 miRNA variants. and 180 putative novel miRNAs in date palm. Expression profiles under salinity revealed differential regulation of some miRNAs in date palm. In leaves. 54 of the identified miRNAs were significantly affected and the majority (70%) of them were upregulated. whereas in roots. 25 of the identified miRNAs were significantly affected and 76% of them were upregulated by the salinity stress. The salt-responsiveness of some of these miRNAs was further validated using semi-quantitative PCR (qPCR). Some of the predicted targets for the identified miRNA include genes with known functions in plant salt tolerance. such as potassium channel AKT2-like proteins. vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein. calcium-dependent and mitogen-activated proteins.

A better understanding of the biogeographic history of Sundaland could help explain current patterns of biodiversity and support the development of effective forest conservation strategies. Dipterocarpaceae trees dominate the rainforests of Sundaland. and their distributions serve as a proxy for rainforest extent. We used species distribution models (SDMs) of 317 Dipterocarp species to estimate the geographic extent of appropriate climatic conditions for rainforest on Sundaland at the last glacial maximum (LGM). The SDMs suggest that the climate of central Sundaland at the LGM was suitable to sustain Dipterocarp rainforest. and that the presence of a previously suggested transequatorial savannah corridor at that time is unlikely.

What constitutes the most critical biological information for plant conservation has been the issue of discussion for the last 30 years. Most scientists promote an approach that is either ecological or genetic in emphasis. Ecological and genetic processes will often interact synergistically to influence the population viability and to determine the persistence of populations in the long run. Consequently. conservation management of plant species. in addition to ecological information. requires a robust understanding of underlying genetic processes as well as the variation within and between populations. Conservation has a cost and the resources available for conservation programs are always limited.

Saw,,,,21–45,Malayan Forest Records No. 49,Peninsular Malaysia is at the southern extremity of the Asian continent and covers an area of 131.598 km2. It separates the South China Sea from the Straits of Malacca. The region is generally hilly or mountainous and over 40% of the land is above 150 m asl with 23% over 300 m (Wyatt-Smith. 1963). The mountains run in a series of ranges in a north-south direction (see map on inside front cover). The largest of these. the Main (Titiwangsa) Range. is a continuous granitic range extending from beyond the Perak-Thailand border to the Negeri Sembilan-Melaka boundary near Tampin. The highest peak of the Main Range is G. Korbu (2.182 m). Other important ranges include the Perlis limestone ridge along the west Perlis-Thailand border; the west Kedah and Province Wellesley range; the Bintang range; the Keladang Saiong range running about 160 km parallel to Sg. Perak and between the Bintang and the Main Range; the Benom range of west-central Pahang rises to its highest peak on G. Benom (2.130 m) extending south to G. Ledang (1.276 m) in Johor; the Tahan range in central Pahang with G. Tahan (2.188 m). the highest mountain in Peninsular Malaysia. culminates on the Pahang-Kelantan border in the north and extends into central Johor to the south; and finally a dissected long granitic block in Terengganu forms the boundary with Kelantan and Pahang.

Its flora was poorly documented; therefore. 5 recent expeditions between 1998 and 2004 were carried out. which resulted in the collection of 179 species that belong to 51 families. Six major wadis (sites) were investigated to cover adequately the territory of the Park (35.600 km2) and to attain as complete an inventory of its vascular flora as possible. The floristic composition and species diversity among the wadis showed variations in species richness. yet W. Yahameib was the most diversified. The most species-rich families were Compositae (12%). Leguminosae (9%). Gramineae (6.7%). Caryophyllaceae. Convolvulaceae and Euphorbiaceae (4.4% for each).

Weed communities are mainly affected by the environment. and studies may increase our knowledge of the relationship among the weed flora. soil properties. crop rotation. soil management. fertiliser usage. and weed control. The area under study is one of the most recently reclaimed lands. The recorded 150 species in the monitored 19 sites were distributed within 33 families. The species-rich families were: Poaceae (31). Asteraceae (23). Brassicaceae (13). Chenopodiaceae (12). and Fabaceae (12). Chorological analysis revealed that the widely distributed species belonging to cosmopolitan. palaeotropical. and pantropical chorotypes constituted about 39.3% of the recorded flora. Pure Mediterranean species were very poorly represented. while biregional and triregional Mediterranean chorotypes constituted 28%.

Here we demonstrate that overall estimates of net species diversification are approximately half those reported in ferns and∼ 30% those described for angiosperms. Nevertheless. statistical rate analyses on time-calibrated large-scale phylogenies reveal that mosses and liverworts underwent bursts of diversification since the mid-Mesozoic. The diversification rates further increase in specific lineages towards the Cenozoic to reach. in the most recently derived lineages. values that are comparable to those reported in angiosperms.

Focusing on the Atlantic bryophyte flora distributed across the archipelagos of the Azores. Madeira. the Canary Islands. Western Europe. and northwestern Africa. we used an integrative approach with species distribution modeling and population genetic analyses based on approximate Bayesian computation to determine whether this view applies to organisms with inherent high dispersal capacities.

On islands. the gradual evolution of a new species from a founder event has been called ‘anagenetic speciation’. This process does not lead to rapid and extensive speciation within lineages and has received little attention. Based on a survey of the endemic bryophyte. pteridophyte and spermatophyte floras of nine oceanic archipelagos. we show that anagenesis. as measured by the proportion of genera with single endemic species within a genus. is much higher in bryophytes (73%) and pteridophytes (65%) than in spermatophytes (55%). Anagenesis contributed 49% of bryophyte and 40% of endemic pteridophyte species. but only 17% of spermatophytes.

It includes 499 species: 141 liverworts. 6 hornworts and 352 mosses (7 strictly endemic to the Canary Islands. 19 endemic to Macaronesia and 6 Ibero-Macaronesian endemics). More than 150 new reports for particular islands and many nomenclatural and taxonomical changes have increased the total number of recorded species in comparison with the formerly published checklists. An analysis of species frequency on the seven islands shows that distribution patterns defined as restricted (presencein1or 2 islands) and localised (3. 4 or 5 islands) occur to a similar degree in the Canary Islands (38% and 36%. respectively). while the percentage of species with a general distribution (6 or 7 islands) is slightly lower (27%). Detrended correspondence analysis shows that altitude (in conjunction with heterogeneity and climatic conditions) and island age are the most important factors influencing bryophyte richness in the Canary Islands. On the other hand. species composition in these islands is mainly correlated with distance from the mainland and levels of precipitation. Two island groups can be distinguished according to the bryophyte flora. The driest islands Lanzarote and Fuerteventura show greater affinities with Deserta and some Cape Verde Islands than the other Canary Islands (especially in liverworts).

The life‐history traits (LHTs) observed in oceanic island floras were statistically different from those observed on continents. evidencing the evolution of island syndromes. In contrast.

Such an approach for endangered species is a priority task for India's conservation programme. The mountain goat (goral) is an endangered species. The viable population of goral (Nemorhaedus goral) on Siwalik mountain is now confined to only Rajaji National Park. Uttar Pradesh. The goral habitat is restricted to specific land attributes. viz. landcover. slope. water availability and human habitation. Human settlements. biotic pressure (grazing and lopping) and erosional subsidence on hills have threatened goral habitat. The study is an attempt to model habitat suitability using spatial landscape patterns (interspersion and juxtaposition) and specific habitat requirements (restrictive factors).

Bangalore,Vegetation/forests sequester atmospheric carbon and therefore. play an important role in energy and mass exchange on earth and sustenance of the life on the planet earth. However. threat of global warming due to increased levels of Green House Gases (GHG) in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel burning. industrialization. decreased forest cover etc.. in last 150 years have spurred research interest in forest carbon cycle. Carbon di-oxide is major constituent of GHGs and plays a major role in altering the radiation balance. The major pools of carbon are lithosphere (earth’s crust). ocean. soil. atmosphere and the biosphere. Depending upon the temporal scale and location all of these can act as sink or sources of carbon. Whether India is a net sink or source of carbon cannot be unambiguously answered. Systemic studies. therefore. are required to assess the pools and fluxes of carbon to arrive at the country level carbon budget.

In both cases. vegetation and soils of adjacent. relatively undisturbed areas were also studied for comparison. Species richness was lowest (26 species) at the 1-year old site and highest (114 species) at unmined sites; species richness increased youngest to the oldest sites.

Samples were collected near Beulah in western North Dakota from 4 sites (1 each from grazed and ungrazed areas. l-year old stockpiled topsoil. and a fresh stockpile). Samples were taken from 3 depths and allowed to germinate in a growth chamber for 16 months. The grazed site had a seed density of over 7.700 seeds m*(43% were from weed species). and the ungrazed site had 3.900 seeds mm2 (7% were weeds); the stockpiled topsoils had very low seed densities. Seed density and diversity decreased with depth on both the grazed and ungrazed sites; this was especially true for the grazed site where 94% of the seeds were found in the top 7.5 cm. Comparisons were made between the seed banks and the aboveground vegetation of the unmined site and 4 mined sites (ages 1-4 years after reclamation). Analysis indicated that seeds of the most prevalent colonizers after reclamation [eg summer cypress (~~ &a scoparia). green pigeongrass (Setaria viridis). and Russian thistle (Salsola co&a)] were not present in the topsoil; rather. they immigrated from the surrounding areas. Several species which were present in the seed bank [eg rough penny royal (Hedeoma hispida). buckhorn (Plantago patagonica). white sage (Artemisia ludoviciana). fringed sage (A. frigida). and wormwood (A. absinthium)] were found in the aboveground vegetation of 3-and I-year-old mined sites. and at the unmined site.

Both land and its component soil resources are finite. The biological capability of the earth’s ecosystems is limited. even though agriculture productivity has been manipulated by genetic selection of plants. adjusting nutrient flows. managing water. and controlling pests. However. these interventions also have serious economic and environmental repercussions. Increasing populations require more space. more food. more fuels and more of other resources. For soil scientists. the challenge is to (a) understand soil processes.

Switch grass covered approximately 48% of the 15‐year‐old Chaumont Tailings. Establishment of switch‐grass stands improved the fertility of the site by adding organic matter. raising pH. and elevating cation exchange capacity and concentrations of major nutrients (N. P. and K). Switch‐grass stands also aided the initial recruitment of such pioneer species as Populus spp. (aspens). Salix spp. (willows). and Betula spp. (birches). This facilitation of recruitment of woody species is explained as follows: (1) robust switch‐grass stands physically captured the wind‐disseminated seeds of these species; (2) switch grass acted as a “nurse crop” for these species. thus these species were able to increase their density …,True,FsVIQUYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,46,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1526-100X.1995.tb00085.x,8280094171444960099,/scholar?cites=8280094171444960099,,,0,0,0

Our studies of invasive watermilfoil (Myriophyllum) populations revealed widespread polymorphisms in biparentally inherited nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences. which were not detected in populations of native North American species. Subclones of the polymorphic regions revealed the occurrence of distinct sequences matching those acquired from both nonindigenous and native North American species. Molecular data demonstrate clearly that invasive watermilfoil populations in North America have resulted from hybridization between nonindigenous and native species.

Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. long‐range dispersal by waterfowl was the prevailing explanation for widespread aquatic plant distributions. This explanation gradually fell into disfavor as biologists raised doubts as to the ability of waterfowl to transport propagules across the extensive transoceanic distances between the continents on which an assortment of aquatic taxa now reside.

Myriophyllum has a cosmopolitan distribution with its center of diversity in Australia (> 37 endemics). The widespread invasive species of the genus (M. aquaticum.

We generate a novel phylogenetic hypothesis informed by nuclear and plastid DNA sequences of c. 60 % of the c. 800 Erica species (of which 690 are endemic to the CFR). and use this to estimate clade ages (using RELTIME; BEAST). net diversification rates (GEIGER). and shifts in rates of diversification in different areas (BAMM; MuSSE). The diversity of Erica species in the CFR is the result of a single radiation within the last c. 15 million years. Compared to ancestral lineages in the Palearctic. the rate of speciation accelerated across Africa and Madagascar. with a further burst of speciation within the CFR that also exceeds the net diversification rates of other Cape clades.

1098003,Five nuclear loci resolve the polyploid history of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and relatives,2012,Jimmy K Triplett and Yunjing Wang and Jinshun Zhong and Elizabeth A Kellogg,7,PLoS One,6,e38702,Public Library of Science,Polyploidy poses challenges for phylogenetic reconstruction because of the need to identify and distinguish between homoeologous loci. This can be addressed by use of low copy nuclear markers. Panicum s.s. is a genus of about 100 species in the grass tribe Paniceae. subfamily Panicoideae. and is divided into five sections. Many of the species are known to be polyploids. The most well-known of the Panicum polyploids are switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and common or Proso millet (P. miliaceum). Switchgrass is in section Virgata. along with P. tricholaenoides. P. amarum. and P. amarulum. whereas P. miliaceum is in sect. Panicum. We have generated sequence data from five low copy nuclear loci and two chloroplast loci and have clarified the origin of P. virgatum. We find that all members of sects. Virgata and Urvilleana are the result of diversification after a single allopolyploidy event. The closest diploid relatives of switchgrass are in sect. Rudgeana. native to Central and South America. Within sections Virgata and Urvilleana. P. tricholaenoides is sister to the remaining species. Panicum racemosum and P. urvilleanum form a clade. which may be sister to P. chloroleucum. Panicum amarum. P. amarulum. and the lowland and upland ecotypes of P. virgatum together form a clade. within which relationships are complex. Hexaploid and octoploid plants are likely allopolyploids. with P. amarum and P. amarulum sharing genomes with P. virgatum. Octoploid P. virgatum plants are formed via hybridization between disparate tetraploids.

New pollen data. together with abundant existing palynological information from this area. show a progressive reduction in plant diversity caused by a decrease in the most thermophilous and high-water requirement plants and. on the contrary. an increase in warm-temperate (mesothermic) and seasonal-adapted taxa during the Middle–Late Miocene and Pliocene. At the same time. an increase in high-elevation trees and herbs has been recorded. with a strong augmentation in Artemisia. first in the eastern Mediterranean and later on in the western Mediterranean area.

This use of models has become an important part of the recent science that has become known as biodiversity informatics. Because of the nature of species data. considerable effort has often been spent in managing the quality of those species data. but less time has generally been spent on determining the quality and efficacy of the environmental data against which the species data are being modeled. This paper examines a range of environmental data being used in species distribution modeling. and looks at how they are prepared. their quality and use. and some of the commonly encountered pitfalls and problems in using these data in species’ distribution modeling.,True,6veKwzwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,74,https://journals.ku.edu/jbi/article/view/5,5514611506373574651,/scholar?cites=5514611506373574651,,https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jbi/article/download/5/3,0,0,0

1098056,A system of chromosome classification and nomenclature,1983,Z Abraham and P Nagendra Prasad,48,Cytologia,1,95-101,Japan Mendel Society. International Society of Cytology,Chromosome morphology is usually studied on the basis of the position of the primary constriction (or centromere or kinetochore). which is a principal landmark in contracted metaphase chromosomes. Cytologists have adopted several methods to determine the centromere locations and described the chromosomes as telocentric (centromere at one end of the chromosome). acrocentric (centromere near one end of the chromosome). submetacentric (centromere nearer to one end of the chro mosome than the other) and metacentric (centromere at or near the middle of the chromosome). These four categories are not sharply distinct. but grade imper ceptibly into each other (Stebbins 1971). The chromosomes are also described as median. nearly median. nearly submedian. submedian. nearly subterminal. sub terminal. nearly terminal and terminal (Sharma and Sharma 1960. Sharma and Choudhury 1964. Adhikary 1963. 1974. Bose and Flory 1965). Thus there exists a great deal of confusion in describing a chromosome on the basis of centromere position.Levan et al.(1964) recognised the location of centromere in median point (M). median region (m). submedian region (sm). subterminal region (st). terminal region (t) and terminal point (T). However. this system did not give due consideration to a number of oftquoted nomenclatures of centromere locations like nearly submedian and nearly subterminal. The system of Levan et al.(1964) was based on a) dif ference (d) between long arm (1) and short arm (s). where the whole chromosome= 10 units; b) arm ratio (r) as the ratio of short arm/long arm; and c) centromeric index (i) as 100 s/c in the …,True,cz1iw3UAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,55,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/cytologia1929/48/1/48_1_95/_article/-char/ja/,15986613583330901119,/scholar?cites=15986613583330901119,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/cytologia1929/48/1/48_1_95/_pdf,0,0,0

The low per capita cropland in China makes it impractical to convert cropland to energy crop cultivation as in other countries; development of energy crops must not compete with food and other cash crops for prime cropland. Mulberry planted on marginal lands like land risers. land boundaries and waste slopelands in Ningnan County of China's southwestern Sichuan Province not only yielded enough leaf biomass to support a production of over 6000 t of cocoons in 2005. but also produced large amounts of woody biomass through annual pruning. Mulberry planted on marginal lands would not be replaced by food or other cash crops if cocoon prices drop.

By comparing the secreted reporter α‐amylase with the ER‐retained reporter α‐amylase‐HDEL. it was concluded that SYP81 overexpression inhibits both retrograde and anterograde transport. while SYP31 overexpression mainly affected anterograde transport. Of the other interacting SNAREs investigated. only the overexpression of MEMB11 led to an inhibition of protein secretion. Although the position of a fluorescent tag does not influence the correct localization of the fusion protein. only N‐terminal‐tagged SYP31 retained the ability of the untagged SNARE to inhibit transport.

Dry-matter production. as hay. from unfertilized species-rich semi-natural grasslands ranged from less than 20% to about 80% of the production that might be expected from agriculturally improved and intensively managed grasslands. Unfertilized species-rich grasslands had lower growth rates. reflecting low nutrient availability in spring and early summer. Low soil phosphorus availability appears to be a key factor allowing high species-richness to be maintained. The in vitro digestibilities of herbage cut for hay from semi-natural grasslands were 20%. or more. below values for conserved forages from intensively managed grassland. When losses incurred during the hay-making process were taken into account. then the nitrogen content of hays from many semi-natural grasslands appear to be sub-optimal for productive livestock. Metabolizable energy values of herbage cut for hay were 10-40% below values for intensively managed conserved grass. Phosphorus content of forages from most species-rich grasslands was either below the metabolic requirement of livestock or inadequate to sustain high individual animal performance.

Locating. describing and evaluating the dwindling cover has been a major challenge for conservationists. A concentrated vegetation survey effort at grassland sites has been mounted within different parts of Britain since the late 1970s. Plant community recognition has benefited considerably from the development of the contemporary National Vegetation Classification. and its widespread adoption permits national inventory of comparable vegetation data. Findings of a range of surveys (ninety-eight in total). undertaken between 1978 and 1996 in England and Wales covering different forms of unimproved lowland grassland. are collated and reviewed. Vegetation data were abstracted from internally published survey reports. Calcicolous and neutral grasslands have been covered more thoroughly than acidic and wet or marshy grasslands. Cover data are summarized at community level. Overall estimates from survey results indicate that there are some 27500-40000 ha of calcicolous grassland. 7500-15000 ha of unimproved neutral pasture and hay meadow. 8000-15000 ha of acidic grassland and 9000-17500 ha of wet grassland in lowland England and Wales; these represent only 1-2% of the cover of permanent lowland grassland. Some communities have additional representation in heathlands. mires and upland environments.

The number of species is better correlated with a measure of habitat diversity than with reserve area. but these two factors are themselves strongly correlated.

Much grassland in the UK has undergone agricultural ‘improvement’through the re-sowing of plants. high inputs of inorganic fertilisers and intensive cutting or grazing. These activities have created grasslands dominated by a few agricultural grasses and white clover (Trifolium repens).

Agricultural intensification. particularly ploughing and reseeding and a shift from hay‐making to silage production over the last 50 years. has resulted in large losses of species‐rich upland hay meadows. Remaining species‐rich meadows have been the focus of much nature conservation effort resulting in many of the species‐rich sites being protected by statutory designations or through voluntary agri‐environment scheme agreements. Research and monitoring has tended to confirm that species richness is maximized by management involving spring and autumn grazing. a mid‐July hay cut. no inorganic fertilizer and possibly low levels of farmyard manure.

Response threshold models (RTM) have been commonly used to analyze patterns of division of labor. However. these models have been explored empirically and theoretically for only a limited number of tasks. and few studies have examined predictions of the model as colony size and work availability change. We theoretically examine how group size influences division of labor using a fixed response-threshold model. We simultaneously explore how expected by-products of increased colony size. including demand (total work need relative to total work force available) and task number. affect this relationship.

An abundant species that is endemic to a single patch can be as much of a conservation concern as a rare cosmopolitan species. I extend Shannon's and Simpson's indices to simultaneously account for species richness and relative abundances – i.e. extend them to multispecies metacommunities – by making the inputs to each index a matrix. rather than a vector.

Sex is usually perceived as the source of additive genetic variance that drives eukaryotic evolution vis‐à‐vis adaptation and Fisher's fundamental theorem. However. evidence for sex decreasing genetic variation appears in ecology. paleontology. population genetics. and cancer biology. The common thread among many of these disciplines is that sex acts like a coarse filter. weeding out major changes. such as chromosomal rearrangements (that are almost always deleterious). but letting minor variation. such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral). flow through the sexual sieve. Sex acts as a constraint on genomic and epigenetic variation. thereby limiting adaptive evolution.

I propose that differences between sexes are initially determined by differential methylation in nuclear DNA between females and males. driving Muller's ratchet. Methylation of promoters suppresses transcription. including loci coding for gamete production. thereby converting hermaphroditic individuals into females or males. Differential methylation of sex chromosomes suppresses recombination and increases mutation rate. thereby geometrically increasing the speed of Muller's ratchet.

1098155,Global DNA cytosine methylation as an evolving trait: phylogenetic signal and correlated evolution with genome size in angiosperms,2015,Conchita Alonso and Ricardo Pérez and Pilar Bazaga and Carlos M Herrera,6,Frontiers in Genetics,,4,Frontiers,DNA cytosine methylation is a widespread epigenetic mechanism in eukaryotes. and plant genomes commonly are densely methylated. Genomic methylation can be associated with functional consequences such as mutational events. genomic instability or altered gene expression. but little is known on interspecific variation in global cytosine methylation in plants. In this paper. we compare global cytosine methylation estimates obtained by HPLC and use a phylogenetically-informed analytical approach to test for significance of evolutionary signatures of this trait across 54 angiosperm species in 25 families. We evaluate whether interspecific variation in global cytosine methylation is statistically related to phylogenetic distance and also whether it is evolutionarily correlated with genome size (C-value). Global cytosine methylation varied widely between species. ranging between 5.3% (Arabidopsis) and 39.2% (Narcissus). Differences between species were related to their evolutionary trajectories. as denoted by the strong phylogenetic signal underlying interspecific variation. Global cytosine methylation and genome size were evolutionarily correlated. as revealed by the significant relationship between the corresponding phylogenetically independent contrasts. On average. a ten-fold increase in genome size entailed an increase of about 10% in global cytosine methylation. Results show that global cytosine methylation is an evolving trait in angiosperms whose evolutionary trajectory is significantly linked to changes in genome size. and suggest that the evolutionary implications of epigenetic mechanisms are likely to vary between plant lineages.,True,fWb-A_MAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,72,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2015.00004/full,14245224893159159760,/scholar?cites=14245224893159159760,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2015.00004/full,0,0,0

Species in biodiversity hotspots may thus be more at risk of limited reproduction and subsequent population decline. Should these species have restricted ranges (i.e. be endemics to a certain region). pollen limitation within highly diverse regions may pose an important threat to global plant biodiversity. We further dissect the global pattern by exploring whether pollen limitation of range‐restricted (endemic) species is distinctive and/or relates differently to species diversity than that of widespread (non‐endemic) species.

1098160,Seasonal variation in leaf characteristics and food selectionby larval noctuids on an evergreen Mediterranean shrub,2000,Conchita Alonso and Carlos M Herrera,21,Acta Oecologica,4-5,257-265,Elsevier Masson,Despite year round availability of foliage. abundance of generalist noctuid larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in evergreen-dominated Mediterranean forests has a narrow. distinct spring peak. This restricted larval period has been suggested to result in part from avoidance of the nutritionally poor mature foliage. and preference for nutritionally superior spring-produced young leaves. This study examines this hypothesis by (i) documenting differences in nutritional characteristics between expanding (April) and mature (June) young leaves of the evergreen Mediterranean shrub Daphne laureola L. (Thymelaeaceae). and (ii) experimentally studying the feeding preferences of noctuid larvae for young leaves. old leaves (≥ 1 yr old). and developing fruits of this species in one south-eastern Spanish locality. Young leaves of D. laureola declined in nutrient concentration and specific dry mass from April to June.

1098173,A  new  subfamily  classification  of  the  Leguminosae  based  on   a  taxonomically  comprehensive  phylogeny,2017,LPWG,66,Taxon,,44-77,,The classification of the legume family proposed here addresses the long-known non-monophyly of the traditionally recognised subfamily Caesalpinioideae. by recognising six robustly supported monophyletic subfamilies. This new classification uses as its framework the most comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of legumes to date. based on plastid matK gene sequences. and including near-complete sampling of genera (698 of the currently recognised 765 genera) and ca. 20%(3696) of known species. The matK gene region has been the most widely sequenced across the legumes. and in most legume lineages. this gene region is sufficiently variable to yield well-supported clades. This analysis resolves the same major clades as in other phylogenies of whole plastid and nuclear gene sets (with much sparser taxon sampling). Our analysis improves upon previous studies that have used large phylogenies of the Leguminosae for addressing evolutionary questions. because it maximises generic sampling and provides a phylogenetic tree that is based on a fully curated set of sequences that are vouchered and taxonomically validated. The phylogenetic trees obtained and the underlying data are available to browse and download. facilitating subsequent analyses that require evolutionary trees. Here we propose a new community-endorsed classification of the family that reflects the phylogenetic structure that is consistently resolved and recognises six subfamilies in Leguminosae: a recircumscribed Caesalpinioideae DC..

Apoucouita (Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae). especially regarding anatomical studies. When only vegetative material is available. the identification of such species may be difficult. Additionally. vegetative material of some species of C. sect. Apoucouita may be even harder to identify because they can resemble species of Inga Mill. (Leguminosae-Mimosoideae). The present study focused on recognizing morphoanatomical characters of leaves that are taxonomically useful for the species of C. sect. Apoucouita by employing standard anatomical techniques. The arrangement of the vascular system in the petiole/rachis. dorsiventral mesophyll. mucilage idioblasts in the epidermis of leaflets and hypostomatic leaves were some of the characters shared by all species studied. Length of the petiole. position and type of extrafloral nectaries. leaflet venation. presence and type of papillae on the epidermis of the leaflet blades and sclereids in the mesophyll were some of the characters useful in the distinction of taxa. The vascular arrangement of the petiole/rachis is a promising character in the distinction of species of C. sect. Apoucouita and Inga.

Here. we report the first full plastid sequences of this family. compare general features of the sampled plastomes to other sequenced Myrtales. and survey the plastomes for highly informative regions for phylogenetics.Genome skimming was performed for 16 species spread across the Melastomataceae. Plastomes were assembled. annotated and compared to eight sequenced plastids in the Myrtales. Phylogenetic inference was performed using Maximum Likelihood on six different data sets. where putative biases were taken into account. Summary statistics were generated for all introns and intergenic spacers with suitable size for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and used to rank the markers by phylogenetic information.The majority of the plastomes sampled are conserved in gene content and order. as well as in sequence length and GC content within plastid regions and sequence classes. Departures include the putative presence of rps16 and rpl2 pseudogenes in some plastomes. Phylogenetic analyses of the majority of the schemes analyzed resulted in the same topology with high values of bootstrap support.

In the framework of supervised learning. a dataset of 70 biology-derived and technology-derived developments characterised by 9 different attributes together with their respective values and assigned to one of 17 classes was created. On the basis of the dataset a decision tree was generated which can be used as a straightforward classification tool to identify biology-derived and technology-derived developments.

1098209,Damped oscillations of the giant reed Arundo donax (Poaceae),2004,Olga Speck and Hanns‐Christof Spatz,91,American journal of botany,6,789-796,Botanical Society of America,The slender upright culms of the giant reed (Arundo donax L.) are often exposed to dynamic wind loads causing significant swaying. The giant reed has slightly tapered hollow stems (4–6 m high) with flat leaves and an extensive underground rhizomatous system with solid branches bearing adventitious roots. Quantitative analyses of videorecordings prove that A. donax responds to dynamic deflections of the stem with damped harmonic bending oscillations. The logarithmic decrement can be used to calculate the relative damping. as a measure of the plant's capacity to dissipate vibrational energy. Plants with leaves have a significantly higher damping compared to plants without leaves. A comparison of the relative damping of plants with and without leaves shows that this finding is only partly due to aerodynamic resistance of the leaves. Structural damping also contributes considerably to the overall damping of the …,True,P0WOgoEAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,63,https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.91.6.789,13769359667181001640,/scholar?cites=13769359667181001640,,https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3732/ajb.91.6.789,0,0,0

Thereby. the bark. the entirety of all tissues outside the cambium. serves as an insulation layer. In laboratory experiments. the heat production of a surface fire was simulated and the time span τ60 until the temperature of 60 °C is reached in the inner bark surface was measured. Thereby. τ60—as a measure of the fire resistance—was quantitatively determined for seven tree species. In addition. the influence of bark thickness and moisture content on bark heat insulation capacities was examined. Independent of the tree species and bark moisture content a power function correlation between bark thickness and τ60 was found. Our results also show that fire resistance increases with decreasing bark density.

To examine wind impact. profiles of vertical wind speeds in the plant's natural habitat (southern France) were measured at the edge and within a stand in the main wind direction. Wind speed was recorded simultaneously at five heights. For 75 measurements of within‐canopy wind speed profiles. the attenuation coefficient was 4.4 ± 0.5. a value typical for plant stands with very dense canopies. Video recordings proved that A. donax becomes streamlined with increasing wind speed. reducing the projected surface area of leaves and stem. The total projected surface area is a function of wind speed and can be characterized by a second‐order polynomial regression curve. For small wind velocities up to 1 m/s. the calculated drag force is proportional to the square of the wind speed.

Equisetum hyemale,1998,Th Speck and O Speck and A Emanns and H‐Ch Spatz,111,Botanica acta,5,366-376,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,As in Equisetum giganteum. the hollow stem of Equisetum hyemale owes the mechanical stability of the internodes to an outer ring of strengthening tissue (hypodermal sterome) which provides stiffness and strength in the longitudinal direction. In contrast to hollow‐stemmed grasses. the hypodermal sterome consists of living cells. The compound inner tissue of the overwintering aerial stem of Equisetum hyemale includes a continuous inner and outer endodermis layer of vital thick‐walled cells that have slightly lignified Casparian thickenings. The two endodermis layers provide an inner tension and compression bracing which lend resistance to local buckling. The stress‐strain relation in longitudinal tension is biphasic with remarkably high critical strains especially in the upper parts of the stem.

1098228,Diversity of filamentous fungi in bark beetle galleries in central Europe,2001,Roland Kirschner,,Trichomycetes and other fungal groups,,175-196,Science Publishers,"Woody plants injured or killed by abiotic or biotic factors are a resource of nutrients attractive to a wide range of organisms. The outer bark. however. is still an effective barrier that prevents many organisms from invading the tissues. The nutrients within the sapwood and bark of dying trees and trees that have recently died are explored by ambrosia and bark beetles (Coleoptera. Scolytidae and Platypodidae) that can penetrate the bark. Since such nutrientrich sources are rare in undisturbed forest ecosystems. bark beetles compete inter-and intraspecifically for this habitat (Raffa et al. 1993). This competition probably led to different host preferences and to highly evolved ways of interand intraspecific communications. Most beetle species infest dead or dying trees and are. therefore. regarded as secondary'invaders. Primary bark beetles are able to infest healthy trees and avoid the competition for recently killed trees. but have to overcome the host tree resistance (Raffa et al. 1993).Since Hartig (1844) discovered the fungal nature of the “ambrosia"" associated with a wood-boring bark beetle in Germany. the interactions and associations of fungi with bark beetles became a topic of scientific research. The Dutch elm disease caused by Ophiostoma ulmi (Buisman) Nannf. and O. novo-ulmi Brasier that are transmitted by elm-breeding Scolytus bark beetles became the most prominent manifestation of a bark beetle-fungus interaction (Gibbs. 1978). Ophiostoma species and their possible vectors were extensively studied in investigations on the decline of oak trees in several European regions (EPPO. 1990).

The new system turns a rule-determined nomenclature into a system of names to be decided by committees. The new system cannot be implemented until experts publish well-documented rationales about the generic names to be accepted or suppressed among alternative morphs and the responsible committees act officially. Prioritization vs. suppression is not the same as conservation vs. rejection. If a teleomorphic generic name is suppressed. it still remains valid and legitimate and can still serve as a basis for names of higher-rank taxa. In most cases the teleomorph genus name should be prioritized unless convincing arguments favor preference of the anamorph name. Paraphyletic genera must be recognized. Unless the phylogenetic positions of all type species for possible morphs are confirmed. no prioritization can be fixed.

In addition. primary data on plant parasitic microfungi collected in natural habitats in western Panama are considered. According to these data. Asterinaceae. Meliolales. Phyllachorales. and rust fungi are highly species rich groups in the Neotropics. while smut fungi appear to be less diverse in the tropics than in extratropical regions. Species of Albuginales. Erysiphales. Peronosporales. and Taphrinales are rarely found in the tropics. and are especially scarce in tropical forests. Morphologically. many tropical plant parasitic microfungi are characterized by melanized walls of fruiting bodies and spores. apparently an adaptation to tropical conditions with strong solar radiation. Gelatinous substances may slow down the process of drying out. The absence of a winter season in the tropics is probably the reason for the lack of spore dormancy and the dominance of asexual developmental stages in the Erysiphales and rust fungi.

A combined SSU and LSU rDNA phylogenetic analysis shows that species of Asterina and its anamorphs form a well supported monophyletic clade within the Dothideomycetes with Venturiaceae as sistergroup.

1098252,Spatial and seasonal distribution of seaweeds on coral reefs from Southern Bahia. Brazil,2002,OS Costa Jr and MJ Attrill and AG Pedrini and JC De-Paula,45,,4,346-355,Walter de Gruyter,The last decades have seen increasing concern about the effect of human disturbance on coral reef communities. Recently. some studies have focused on the macroalgae communities of coastal reefs (Larned 1998. Lundberg and Popper 1999. McCook 1999. Miller et al. 1999. Aronson and Precht 2000). paying attention to their roles in both reef construction (Adey 1998) and destruction (Hughes 1994). Some authors (Womersley and Bailey 1969. Round 1981) state that since algae and not corals are dominant in most reef formations. especially in the surf zone. the misleading name coral reef should be abandoned. suggesting that the term ‘biotic reef’would be a better representation. This debate has continued. especially with the recent discussions about coral-algal phase shifts. in which the macroalgal growth outcompetes corals after changes driven by physical and anthropogenic disturbances (Schaffelke 1999. Stiger and Payri 1999. McManus et al. 2000). In Brazilian reefs. however. the scarcity of baseline information makes it difficult to establish any trends. The Bahia State has the most extensive coastline (830 km). as well as the largest and richest coral reefs of Brazil. but their macroalgal flora remains amongst the least studied in the country (Oliveira Filho 1977.

1098255,Benthic marine algae of the coral reefs of Brazil: a literature review,2008,Marcia Abreu de Oliveira Figueiredo and Paulo Antunes Horta and Alexandre de Gusmão Pedrini and José Marcos de Castro Nunes,12,,2,7,Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO),In Brazil. algae in coral reef environments can be found from Maranhão to Bahia State and there are today around 700 taxa. of which 78% are found on reef formations. The Rhodophyta are among the most common taxa found. Corallinales are the least studied group. in spite of their role in the formation and maintenance of Brazilian coral reefs. The species richness of algae on coral reefs is low in comparison with other coastal habitats. but there is an abundance of turf and fleshy macroalgae on certain parts of the coastal reefs. Halimeda spp.. Dictyota spp.. Dictyopteris spp.. Hypnea spp.. Gracilaria spp.. Gelidium spp. and Sargassum spp. are some of the most conspicuous algae. while Caulerpa and Udotea and seagrasses are frequently found on unconsolidated sandy bottoms. Benthic marine algae are important components of shallow coral-reef communities in the Atlantic and they can be regarded as major competitors to corals. Over the last two decades. numerous cases of phase shifts from coral to algal predominance over coral reefs were reported worldwide. These reports coincide with the increasing concern with reef degradation. mainly attributed to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and overfishing. In Brazil the effects of nutrification over coral reef dynamics are only recently being assessed. and crucial basic information is still lacking.

1098263,The peatland map of Europe,2017,Franziska Tanneberger and Asbjørn Moen and Hans Joosten and Nils Nilsen,,,,,International Mire Conservation Group and International Peat Society,Based on the ‘European Mires Book’ of the International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG). this article provides a composite map of national datasets as the first comprehensive peatland map for the whole of Europe. We also present estimates of the extent of peatlands and mires in each European country individually and for the entire continent. A minimum peat thickness criterion has not been strictly applied. to allow for (often historically determined) country-specific definitions. Our ‘peatland’ concept includes all ‘mires’. which are peatlands where peat is being formed. The map was constructed by merging national datasets in GIS while maintaining the mapping scales of the original input data. This ‘bottom-up’ approach indicates that the overall area of peatland in Europe is 593.727 km². Mires were found to cover more than 320.000 km² (around 54 % of the total peatland area). If shallow-peat lands (< 30 cm peat) in European Russia are also taken into account. the total peatland area in Europe is more than 1.000.000 km2 . which is almost 10 % of the total surface area. Composite inventories of national peatland information. as presented here for Europe. may serve to identify gaps and priority areas for field survey. and help to cross-check and calibrate remote sensing based mapping approaches.,True,8r3Dr78AAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC,60,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2476533,10219484432995484252,/scholar?cites=10219484432995484252,,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2476533/Tanneberger%2526al2017.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Thus. species richness (alpha diversity) and the size of territories. and their logarithmic ratio. are taken into consideration. At the present. bryophyte flora in the region of SE Europe counts 5 hornworts. 267 liverworts and 897 moss species. It comprises 59.9% of European hepatic and 69.4% of moss flora. The richest territories in hepatic species are Romania (197 sp.) followed by Bulgaria (170 sp.) and Slovenia (167 sp.). On the other side. the poorest territories in hepatic species are the European part of Turkey (27 sp.). FYR of Macedonia (69 sp.) and Albania (91sp.).

Sveučilište u Zagrebu,Croatia is among the most ecologically diverse and floristically rich countries in Europe. with a great variety of communities. The vegetation elaboration according to the standard central European method was initiated in Croatia at the beginning of the 20th century. In previous overviews of Croatian vegetation. the number of classes and alliances was underrepresented in relation to the country’s floristic richness. Furthermore. the level of knowledge and the amount of available data varied greatly among the various types of vegetation. The aims of this paper are mainly to compile a stabile syntaxonomic list of classes. orders and alliances dominated by vascular plants in Croatia and to adjust Croatian vegetation to the new European syntaxonomic system (EuroVegChecklist). It introduces a consistent description of high-rank syntaxa in Croatian. In conclusion. the vegetation of Croatia comprises 66 classes. 121 orders and 201 alliances. The number of syntaxa shows vegetation diversity that is rather high compared to most other European countries; this is related to the high floristic richness and endemism. The list points out the obvious problems and gaps in our knowledge of vegetation in Croatia and can serve as a baseline for the future vegetation studies.,True,8r3Dr78AAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC,32,https://hrcak.srce.hr/187260,1366482498342303594,/scholar?cites=1366482498342303594,,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/276115,0,0,0

The aim of this study was to apply DNA barcoding methods to support conservation efforts of Dalbergia species in Indochina. We used the recommended rbcL. matK and ITS barcoding markers on 95 samples covering 31 species of Dalbergia. and tested their discrimination ability with both traditional distance-based as well as different model-based machine learning methods. We specifically tested whether the markers could be used to solve taxonomic confusion concerning the timber species Dalbergia oliveri. and to identify the CITES-listed Dalbergia cochinchinensis. We also applied the barcoding markers to 14 samples of unknown identity. In general. we found that the barcoding markers discriminated among Dalbergia species with high accuracy. We found that ITS yielded the single highest discrimination rate (100%). but due to difficulties in obtaining high-quality sequences from degraded material. the better overall choice for Dalbergia seems to be the standard rbcL+matK barcode. as this yielded discrimination rates close to 90% and amplified well. The distance-based method TaxonDNA showed the highest identification rates overall. although a more complete specimen sampling is needed to conclude on the best analytic method.

Most of the mercury released ends up and retained in the soil as complexes of the toxic ionic mercury (Hg 2+). which then can be converted by microbes into the even more toxic methylmercury which tends to bioaccumulate. Mercury detoxification of the soil can also occur by microbes converting the ionic mercury into the least toxic metallic mercury (Hg 0) form. which then evaporates.

1098315,Flammable biomes dominated by eucalypts originated at the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary,2011,Michael D Crisp and Geoffrey E Burrows and Lyn G Cook and Andrew H Thornhill and David MJS Bowman,2,Nature Communications,1,1-8,Nature Publishing Group,Fire is a major modifier of communities. but the evolutionary origins of its prevalent role in shaping current biomes are uncertain. Australia is among the most fire-prone continents. with most of the landmass occupied by the fire-dependent sclerophyll and savanna biomes. In contrast to biomes with similar climates in other continents. Australia has a tree flora dominated by a single genus. Eucalyptus. and related Myrtaceae. A unique mechanism in Myrtaceae for enduring and recovering from fire damage likely resulted in this dominance.

Diversity and endemism are typically assessed by comparing species ranges across regions. However. investigation of patterns of species diversity alone misses out on the full richness of patterns that can be inferred using a phylogenetic approach. Here. using Australian Acacia as an example. we show that the application of phylogenetic methods. particularly two new measures. relative phylogenetic diversity and relative phylogenetic endemism. greatly enhances our knowledge of biodiversity across both space and time.

Many modern groups contain sister taxa that have disjunct transoceanic distributions. which can be interpreted as a result of either vicariance or long-distance dispersal and establishment (LDDE). Further. some Myrtaceae groups occur on Pacific islands with enigmatic geological histories. We tested hypotheses of vicariance and LDDE by estimating divergence times using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated with 12 fossils. In total. 88 genera and 202 species were sampled. representing both subfamilies and all tribes of Myrtaceae. We reconstructed the family as Gondwanan in origin.

In this study. we have developed a new procedure to define the conservation priorities among endemic plants and habitats by evaluating eight criteria. Five criteria deal with the geographic and ecological range of the evaluated species. whereas the other three refer to threats. After the evaluation of each criterion. we combined the partial scores to obtain a priority index (PI). Finally. we characterized the EU habitat categories of conservation concern on the basis of the average PI value of the plants living in each habitat.

Boletales) comprises several saprotrophic (brown rot) taxa. including the aggressive house-infecting dry rot fungus Serpula lacrymans. Recent phylogenetic analyses have indicated that the ectomycorrhiza forming genera Austropaxillus and Gymnopaxillus cluster within Serpula. In this study we use DNA sequence data to investigate phylogenetic relationships. historical biogeography of. and nutritional mode transitions in Serpulaceae. Our results corroborate that the two ectomycorrhiza-forming genera. Austropaxillus and Gymnopaxillus. form a monophyletic group nested within the saprotrophic genus Serpula. and that the Serpula species S. lacrymans and S. himantioides constitute the sister group to the Austropaxillus-Gymnopaxillus clade. We found that both vicariance (Beringian) and long distance dispersal events are needed to explain the phylogeny and current distributions of taxa within Serpulaceae. Our results also show that the transition from brown rot to mycorrhiza has happened only once in a monophyletic Serpulaceae. probably between 50 and 22 million years before present. This study supports the growing understanding that the same geographical barriers that limit plant- and animal dispersal also limit the spread of fungi. as a combination of vicariance and long distance dispersal events are needed to explain the present patterns of distribution in Serpulaceae.

In this paper four generic names (Parastrephia. PhUactisj Anaitis. and Aschenbornia) and about 115 specific names which have been misunderstood or regarded as doubtful since the time of their original publication are first given their rightful status as valid names or synonyms. A few identifications here included have already been published. 1 The genera are arranged in the systematic order of the accepted names. the species alphabetically under the genera.Special attention was given to the investigation of the Heliantheae. particularly in the Prodromus Herbarium of the DeCandolles. now forming a unit in the Delessert Herbarium. Geneva. and in the Schultz Bipontinus Herbarium. which includes Sprengel's types and forms a part of the Cosson Herbarium at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle at Paris. Schultz's herbarium includes. besides his own types and those of Sprengel. a wealth of fragments of types and authentic specimens from other authors. and the Prodromus Herbarium is rich in authentic specimens of earlier writers in addition to De Candolle's own types.
