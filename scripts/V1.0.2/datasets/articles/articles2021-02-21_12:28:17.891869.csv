We previously identified that the fifth PDZ domain of InaD undergoes light-dependent PKC-mediated formation of a disulfide bond which disrupts the binding site. We investigated the interaction of this switch with the adjacent PDZ4 of InaD. We showed that PDZ4 destabilizes the disulfide bond and promotes binding of PDZ5 to its ligand. indicating a previously unidentified allosteric interaction between the two domains. We solved the structure of PDZ45 to 2.4 Å. which revealed that PDZ4 forms an extensive interface with PDZ5 but does not alter its conformation.

Lack of information to guide conservation measures is mainly due to the bird’s elusive behaviour for much of the year and to its remote distribution at higher altitudes of the Caucasus Mountains. In order to fill some of the knowledge gaps. we mapped potential suitable habitat across the Turkish part of the Lesser Caucasus using a spatial regression model. and estimated the total CBG population from alternative assumptions on population density and habitat separation.

China,2013,Jian Zhang and Takeshi Taniguchi and Ryunosuke Tateno and Ming Xu and Sheng Du and Guo-Bin Liu and Norikazu Yamanaka,,Ecological research,,1-9,Springer Japan,Topographic factors strongly affect the diversity of plants and local environmental conditions. yet little is known about their effects on the distribution of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF). By combining morphological and molecular identification methods. we investigated the relationship between EMF communities of Quercus liaotungensis and topographic factors along local slopes in the temperate oak forest on the Loess Plateau of northwest China. ITS-RFLP analysis revealed a high diversity of EMF taxa (135 taxa) associated with Q. liaotungensis along three local slopes. EMF communities among slope sites or slope positions. tended to share major common EMF species. which accounted for more than 80 % of the total EMF abundance. and showed a diverse distribution. which mainly related to rare species.

The IR spectra illustrated a bidentate ligand which coordinates through phenolic oxygen atom and imino nitrogen atom from azomethine bond. UV-Vis spectrophotometry showed the characteristic adsorption bands corresponding to an octahedral geometry for both metal complexes. The general formula established from experimental data was found to be [ML 2 (H 2 O) 2](M= Co (II) and Ni (II)).

These data suggested a different status of water: on the one hand. form an organ to another. and on the other hand. in stressed plants compared with control plants. The observed differences could be correlated with reshaping processes induced by heavy metal stress. especially at cell wall level.

This study examined the nutritional aspects of night eating. its related factors. and the association between night eating and body weight among Korean adolescents. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study analysed the data from a one day 24-hour dietary recall as well as a demographic survey of 1.738 Korean adolescents aged 12 to 18-years-old obtained from the 2010-2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.‘Night eating’was defined as consuming 25% or more of one’s daily energy intake between 21: 00 and 06: 00. Subjects complying with the preceding condition were classified as ‘night eaters’. whereas the rest were considered ‘non-night eaters’. Logistic regression analysis examined factors related to night eating. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between night eating and BMI z-scores. whereas multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between night eating and weight status.RESULTS: About 21% of Korean adolescents appeared to be night eaters. Night eaters showed increased breakfast skipping (P= 0.001). higher energy intake from snacks (P< 0.001). greater proportion of energy intake from fat (P= 0.029). and lower Dietary Diversity Scores (P= 0.008) than non-night eaters.

During the implementation of the Parenting. Eating and Activity for Child Health Program (PEACH™) over a large geographical area (Queensland (QLD). Australia). a natural experiment developed. This experiment provided an opportunity to observe if there was a difference in enrolment for families with overweight children with a weight criterion (referred to as the period with a Targeted Eligibility Criterion (TEC)) compared to when a weight criterion was removed (the period referred to as Universal Eligibility Criterion (UEC)). We also examined the eligibility criterion’s relationship with attendance. parental concern about their child’s weight. estimation of overweight and obesity from parent-reported data. A secondary analysis of baseline data from 926 overweight/obese children from 817 families enrolled in PEACH™ QLD was performed. Analyses were adjusted to control for the presence of clustered data. Bivariate statistics were performed using Pearson chi-square test with the second-order Rao-Scott correction. and Mann–Whitney U-test for non-parametric continuous variables.

1080229,Dietary and health-related characteristics of Korean adolescent night eaters,2015,Emely Yessenia Hernandez Mateo,,,,,,A growing body of research indicates that delayed eating behaviours like night eating could be associated with poor diet quality. risky health behaviours and a greater risk of obesity. This study aimed to examine dietary and health-related characteristics of Korean adolescent night eaters. The present study analysed the data from one day 24-h dietary recall and a demographic survey of 1.738 Korean adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old. abstracted from the 2010-2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). In this study. ‘night eating’ was defined as consuming 25% or more out of the daily Total Energy Intake between 21:00 and 06:00. and the subjects who did this were classified as ‘night eaters’. while the rest were considered ‘non-night eaters’. Around 21% of Korean adolescents appeared to be night eaters. The results of Rao Scott Chi-square tests and t-tests indicated that adolescent night eaters showed increased breakfast skipping (p=0.001) and lower diet quality as evidenced by lower Dietary Diversity Scores (p=0.008). higher intake of energy from snacks (p<0.001) and greater proportion of energy from fat (p=0.029) when compared to non-night eaters. There were no significant differences between night eaters and non-night eaters in daily food group intake. The results from logistic regression analysis indicated that adolescents whose both parents were night eaters were 4.37 times as likely to be night eaters as those whose parents weren’t and male adolescents presented 1.85 times higher odds of night eating than females. Only female adolescents showed a significant relationship between night eating …,True,6Qp51o0AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://s-space.snu.ac.kr/handle/10371/133952,,,,https://s-space.snu.ac.kr/bitstream/10371/133952/1/000000049835.pdf,0,0,0

USA),2019,Helen M Poulos and Kate E Miller and Ross Heinemann and Michelle L Kraczkowski and Adam W Whelchel and Barry Chernoff,11,Sustainability,10,2875,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Dam removal is an increasingly common stream restoration tool. Yet. removing dams from small streams also represents a major disturbance to rivers that can have varied impacts on environmental conditions and aquatic biota. We examined the effects of dam removal on the structure. function. and composition of benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities in a temperate New England stream. We examined the effects of dam removal over the dam removal time-series using linear mixed effects models. autoregressive models. non-metric multidimensional scaling. and indicator and similarity analyses. The results indicated that the dam removal stimulated major shifts in BMI community structure and composition above and below the dam. and that the BMI communities are becoming more similar over time. The mixed model analysis revealed that BMI functional groups and diversity were significantly influenced by sample site and several BMI groups also experienced significant interactions between site and dam stage (P< 0.05). while the multivariate analyses revealed that community structure continues to differ among sites. even three years after dam removal. Our findings indicate that stream restoration through dam removal can have site-specific influences on BMI communities. that interactions among BMI taxa are important determinants of the post-dam removal community. and that the post-dam-removal BMI community continues to be in a state of reorganization.

White-nose syndrome was first detected in the state in 2008; by 2010 significant mortality in hibernacula was documented. Myotis spp. and Perimyotis subflavus proved most vulnerable to the disease. while infection and mortality rates for Eptesicus fuscus were significantly lower and Lasiurus borealis and other tree roosting bats were not known to be infected. The goals of this study were to: 1) document changes to the bat communities. 2) look for evidence of competitive release given species-specific differences in disease mortality rates and 3) look for evidence of prey community response to the removal of bat predators. This last objective was in response to significant associations documented in Chapter 1between bats. particularly WNS-vulnerable species. and benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI). especially of the orders Diptera and Trichoptera. Data show total reductions in activity of 95.2% for Myotis spp. and 81.9% for P. subflavus. and increases to activity levels of E. fuscus and L. borealis of more than 300%. with site-specific differences in the pattern and timing of change. Results provide evidence for a competitive release response by E. fuscus. and some indication of a predator release response in BMI and their fish predators. Spearman rank correlations between bat calls and year of study (1-4) are significant (p<. 05) across all sites and are negative for Myotis and P. subflavus. and positive for E. fuscus and L. borealis.

For bats. relative prey abundance can drive foraging habitat choice. but may be constrained by how its structure affects flight. Habitat may also influence bats indirectly. through its affect on prey. This study took place within river corridors. a system known to host prey and be preferentially utilized by some bat species. The goal of the study was to contribute to our understanding of bat foraging habitat preferences by developing models to explain bat species’ use of river habitat that included the direct effects of prey abundance and structural habitat as well as a third consideration–the environmental conditions influencing prey. Aquatic insect prey was considered at the aquatic/immature life stage. that is. as benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI). A conceptual model developed from the literature and our lab’s stream studies helped determine the environmental variables included to explain abundance of both predator and prey. Variables were considered at three general spatial scales. in-. near-and far-stream. and included canopy characteristics. river width. water conditions. river substrate. landcover. and because of its potential to produce diverse and abundant BMI. riffle area. Biological communities and habitat variables were sampled for two years. 2008-09. Results show that BMI abundance. specifically of Diptera. and Trichoptera and its most abundant family.

Information about the fish community is increasingly being used as well. in order to create a more comprehensive assessment. Associations between insectivorous bats and aquatic insects have led some researchers to speculate that bats may also be useful as bioindicators of stream health. This hypothesis has been tested in a variety of studies. with mixed results. Few studies have evaluated associations between specific measures of bat activity and the BMI community. and none to date have considered information provided by fish metrics. The purpose of this study was to assess agreement between aquatic community measures of stream condition and levels of bat activity. and to identify other aspects of aquatic communities or the stream system with which bats are associated. Data on BMI. fish and bats were collected at eight study sites along two Connecticut rivers (2008-2011). Metrics for bat activity included abundance for high and low frequency call groups (HighF and LowF). the percent of calls containing feeding buzzes. and taxa richness. Since white-nose syndrome (WNS) has dramatically reduced populations of Myotis spp. and Perimyotis subflavus in the state. these metrics were calculated with both pre-(2008) and post-(2011) WNS data.

Quantitative differences in IFNAR binding correlate with antiviral activity. but whether IFN-Is exhibit qualitative differences remains controversial. Moreover. the IFN-I response is protective during acute HIV-1 infection. but likely pathogenic during the chronic stages. To gain a deeper understanding of the IFN-I response. we compared the interferomes of IFNα subtypes dominantly-expressed in HIV-1-exposed plasmacytoid dendritic cells (1. 2. 5. 8 and 14) and IFNβ in the earliest cellular targets of HIV-1 infection. Primary gut CD4 T cells from 3 donors were treated for 18 hours ex vivo with individual IFN-Is normalized for IFNAR signaling strength.

Amplification and overexpression of cyclin D1 occur in tumorigenesis of several types of human cancers. including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Intrabodies can be directed to all intracellular compartments to neutralize and block the function of target proteins. This study is designed to construct an intrabody against cyclin D1 and investigate its role in the hepatocellular carcinoma progression. Methods: A single-chain fragment of antibody variable region (scFv) against cyclin D1 (AD1) was prepared by phage display technique. Subsequently. an expression plasmid plntra-AD1 habouring an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained scFv gene against human cyclin D1 (Intra-AD1) was constructed. The expression and subcellular distribution of IntraAD1 in HepG2 cells were detected by RT-PCR. Western blot and fluorescence staining analysis. Antitumor efficacy of Intra-AD1 on hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo and in vitro was investigated. The mimic epitope peptides recognized by AD1 were obtained by phage peptides library display technique. To verify the results. the spatial structure of AD1 was modeled and docked with cyclin D1 by computer software.

This pathology has become even rarer because of prompt diagnosis and expedient surgical intervention for gallstones. So far. there is one published report of a SCF due to gallbladder adenocarcinoma. We present the case of a woman aged 87 years. admitted to the Vth Department of Surgery. Clinical Municipal Hospital of Cluj-Napoca (Romania) for a tumoral mass located in the epigastrium. In the epigastrium. the patient had three skin orifices of about 1–2 mm each. through which purulent secretion occurred. The abdominal ultrasound highlighted a cholecystocutaneous fistula with the presence of a subcutaneous gallstone. Intraoperatively. we found a cholecystocutaneous fistula. a 1 cm subcutaneous gallstone. gallbladder with thickened walls containing a cylinder-shaped gallstone of 5/3 cm. Fistulectomy. gallstones extraction and cholecystectomy were performed. The histopathological examination highlighted gallbladder adenocarcinoma. In conclusion.

METHODS: The prospective study included 301 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. stages I-III. undergoing curative surgery. Demographic data. clinical and anamnestic data. laboratory exams. paraclinical examinations. morphological and pathological examination were recorded. The Petersen index was calculated. Tumor necrosis. desmoplasia and mucinous component were assessed. Local inflammatory response was calculated using Klintrup criteria. Patients were followed for five years after surgery. RESULTS: There were 197 patients (66.4%) who survived and 104 patients (34.6%) who died during the 5-year follow-up period. Multivariate analysis showed that death was mostly associated with patients over 60 years of age (p= 0.05). Tumor location within the colon was associated with a better survival than tumor location within the rectum (HR-0.57; p= 0.02). Patients with T> 2 had a poor prognosis compared to those with T=< 2 (HR-2.23; p= 0.02). Patients with Klintrup score> 1 had a better prognosis (HR-0.20; p< 0.001). Patients with venous invasion showed significantly worse prognosis (HR-2.26; p= 0.003). Patients with desmoplasia score 3 had lower death rates than those with score 1 (HR-0.42; p= 0.01).

Surveyed in this study are 550 students and 30 teachers in 3 high schools in Hanoi. The nominal scale and convenience sampling method were used. The results of the study showed that there are advantages and disadvantages of applying the model. such as the good ability to furnish personal technology equipment; the habit of teaching and learning with the support of information technology; inequality in teachers’ knowledge and experience of blended learning; the fact that teachers’ teaching objective is substantially based on traditional teaching. For this reason. some solutions were proposed with a view to efficiently applying the blended learning model. including special importance to the increase of teachers’ and students’ awareness. investment in infrastructure development. application of the blended learning model according to a roadmap. and promulgation of a policy on fostering and encouraging teachers to apply the blended learning model.

1080332,Computational Study of Lipid–Protein Interactions of Cytochrome bc1 Using Atomistic Molecular Dynamics Simulations,2017,Noora Aho,,,,,,Cytochrome bc1. also known as complex III. is the third enzyme of the electron transfer chain in cellular respiration. which is the main process generating energy in living cells. Complex III operates by oxidizing ubiquinol. and transferring two electrons to cytochrome c. while reducing ubiquinone. The electron transfer is coupled to proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Thus. complex III contributes to generation of a proton electrochemical gradient.  which is required for the function of ATP synthase. Cardiolipins (CLs). constituting up to 20 mol % of lipids in the inner mitochondrial membrane. have an important role in the structure and dynamics of the membrane. as well as in maintaining the correct function of the whole electron transfer chain. Cardiolipins are especially vulnerable to oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to their dimeric structure with four doubly unsaturated acyl chains. Cytochrome bc1 is one of the main producers of ROS in mitochondria. increasing the exposure of tightly bound CLs to oxidation. Oxidative stress and CL oxidation have been associated with. for instance. programmed cell death and aging. and developing Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The objective of this thesis was to build a new computational model of cytochrome bc1 in a membrane. and to study the lipid interactions of complex III using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. A model system with a high-resolution structure of complex III. embedded in a multicomponent bilayer mimicking the inner mitochondrial membrane was constructed.

However. BSFM has not been evaluated for dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus). an economically important fish in South Africa. Therefore. this five-week study investigated the effect of partially replacing fishmeal with BSFM on feed utilization. growth performance. and blood parameters of juvenile dusky kob in a recirculating aquaculture system. Four diets were formulated by replacing fishmeal in a commercial dusky kob diet with BSFM at the rate of 0 (BSFM0). 50 (BSFM50). 100 (BSFM100). and 200 g/kg (BSFM200). Fish length and weights were measured weekly. while blood analyses were performed at the end of Week 5. For fish length and weight gain. there were neither linear nor quadratic responses in Weeks 1–4. while quadratic trends (y= 14.77 (±0.19)–0.11 (±0.05) x+ 0.01 (±0.00) x 2; R 2= 0.35 and y= 49.85 (±1.53)–1.22 (±0.39) x+ 0.06 (±0.02) x 2; R 2= 0.47. respectively) were observed in Week 5 in response to BSFM levels. Quadratic effects (y= 1.75 (±0.15)+ 0.10 (±0.04) x− 0.01 (±0.00) x 2; R 2= 0.39) were also observed for feed conversion ratio (FCR) in response to BSFM inclusion levels. Fish fed BSFM200 had a similar overall FCR and specific growth rate as those reared on BSFM0. All blood parameters fell within the normal range for the dusky kob.

Forty-five fish (14.44±0.27 g) were randomly distributed into each of 12 experimental tanks. Each dietary treatment was randomly allocated to three tanks and offered to fish at 2.8% body weight. Ten fish from each tank were randomly sampled weekly for length and weight measurements. At termination. three fish from each tank were sampled for distal intestinal tissues for histology preparation. A non-significant (P> 0.05) interaction between the diets and the fish age (weeks) on both the weight and caudal length of the fish was observed. The fish weight decreased significantly with an increase in Aquapro® inclusion in the diets beyond 100 g. kg-1. The Aqua150 diet produced the least weight gain of 24.57±2.44 g. Aquapro® inclusion in the diets did not cause any gut morphological alterations in the fish. In conclusion.

As OAT2 orthologs have been poorly studied in non-mammalian species. the goal of our study was to determine phylogenetic relationships. tissue distribution and substrate specificity of zebrafish Oat2d. Phylogenetic analysis of OAT/Oat genes confirmed similarities among mammalian and zebrafish Oat transporters. Zebrafish Oat2d highly expressed in intestine and moderately expressed in testes and brain. Western blot analysis revealed protein band of 60 kDa. and immunocytochemistry showed its correct localization in the plasma membrane. Functional studies using HEK293T cells overexpressing zebrafish Oat2d revealed two model fluorescent substrates of Oat2d: lucifer yellow (LY. Km= 56.36 µM) and 6-carboxyfluorescein (Km= 210.1 µM). The initial screening with various endo-and xenobiotics showed significant inhibition of Oat2d mediated uptake of LY by endogenous compounds (α-ketoglutarate. fumarate. bilirubin and deoxycholic acid) and exogenous compounds (p-aminohippurate …,True,Pxtl7UkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://www.bib.irb.hr/979968?rad=979968,,,,,0,0,0
1080366,Characterization of organic cation transporters in zebrafish (Danio rerio),,Jelena Dragojević and Ivan Mihaljević and Marta Popović and Roko Žaja and Nikola Maraković and Tvrtko Smital,,Molecules of Life-FEBS3+ Meeting,,61,,Uptake transporters represent integral elements in the ADME (Absorption. Distribution. Metabolism. Excretion) processes and toxicological response. They play crucial role in the initial phase of cellular metabolism of xeno-and endobiotics by mediating the uptake of compounds across the cell membrane. The majority of uptake transporters belong to the SLC (Solute Carrier) protein superfamily which is one of the largest known protein superfamilies. Organic cation transporters (OCTs) are members of SLC22A family. There are three human OCT members. OCT1-3. OCT1 and OCT2 are dominantly expressed in liver and kidney. respectively. OCTs are localized in basolateral membranes of blood-tissue barrier cells and they are responsible for polyspecific transport of numerous organic cations. Using phylogenetic and synteny analysis of previously identified two members of zebrafish Octs. we determined orthological relationship with human and other vertebrates Octs. We also determined dominant expression of Oct1 in zebrafish kidney and liver. whereas Oct2 showed lower but ubiquitous expression. Functional characterization was performed using newly identified fluorescent Oct1 substrates. which were used as tool for determination of interactions with various environmentally and physiologically relevant compounds. Initial interaction screen with ASP+ as fluorescent substrate and numerous tested compounds revealed steroid hormones as potent interactors of Oct1. with the highest inhibition constants for progesterone (Ki= 2 µM). androstenedione (5.3 µM) and testosterone (13.2 µM).

This research was conducted to analyze the job satisfaction of nurses based on Internal Service Quality in the inpatient installation of RSI A. Yani Surabaya. The study was conducted with an observational analytic design and cross-sectional approach. The study population was the nurses in the inpatient installation of RSI A. Yani Surabaya. a total of 104 nurses. The sample size was 78 nurses who were spread in each inpatient room of RSI A. Yani Surabaya. The method of sampling using simple random sampling. Data analysis was performed using binary logistic regression test. The results showed that 98.7% of nurses rated internal service quality as good and 64.1% of nurses said they were satisfied. Based on the statistical test. it was found that the value of p= 0.999 (> 0.05). which means that internal service quality has no significant effect on job satisfaction of nurses.

One possible driving force for this genome size difference could be non-random chromosome segregation. In Caenorhabditis elegans. chromosome assortment is non-independent and violates Mendel’s second law.

1080409,Ultrastructure of the statocytes and cells of the distal elongation zone of Arabidopsis thaliana under the conditions of clinorotation,2010,SM Romanchuk,44,Cytology and genetics,6,329-333,Allerton Press. Inc.,This paper presents the results of an electron microscope study of the root apices of 3-. 5- and 7- day-old seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under the conditions of stationary control and clinorotation. We demonstrated both the similarities with the control group and the differences in the ultrastructure of statocytes and cells of the distal zone of elongation under clinorotation. For the first time it was possible to establish the sensitivity of ER bodies. which are granular endoplasmic reticulum derived organelles containing β-glucosidase. to the influence of simulated microgravity. As a result. an increase in the number and area of ER bodies per section of a cell and in the variability of their forms was detected. The degree of these changes correlated with the duration of clinorotation. The supposition concerning the protective role of ER bodies in plant adaptation to microgravity is based on the data obtained.,True,9HnhwG0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S0095452710060010,17037316315709248962,/scholar?cites=17037316315709248962,,,0,0,0

1080439,Using FGD gypsum to remove soluble phosphorus from agricultural drainage waters,2010,Ray B Bryant and B Anthony and K Peter,2,"2010 Annual Meetings theme:"" Green Revolution",,,,After several decades of applying chicken litter to meet crop demands for nitrogen. high levels of legacy phosphorus (P) in soils of the Delmarva Peninsula are a major source of soluble P entering drainage ditches that empty to the Chesapeake Bay. In April. 2007. Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) gypsum was used to construct a ditch filter to precipitate soluble P as calcium phosphate. Filtration through a bed of FGD gypsum removed 35 to 90% of the P from ditch flow that passed through the filter. Although chemically effective. large flow events topped the weir. and P rich waters flowed to the Manokin River. Simultaneously. research on groundwater hydrology in Coastal Plain soils of the Delmarva showed that overland flow accounts for less than or equal to 10% of P export to ditches. Lateral groundwater flow. during storm events when water tables are high. is the major pathway for soluble P delivery to ditches. In August. 2009. gypsum “curtains.” consisting of FGD gypsum-filled trenches parallel to the ditch. were installed and monitored by piezometers. Lateral flow rates were not diminished by the gypsum curtains. and soluble P was reduced by 50 to 95% as groundwater passed through the high calcium environment of the buried gypsum. Environmental concerns due to higher levels of mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) in FGD gypsum than in naturally occurring mined gypsum were determined to be unfounded. Filtered water had no detectable Hg. Arsenate. which is present in elevated levels in poultry litter-amended soils. behaves similarly to phosphate.

One potential way to reduce nutrient loads from agricultural drainage ditches is to install filter structures containing phosphorus sorbing materials (PSMs) such as gypsum to remove phosphorus directly from ditch flow. One of the projected advantages of such a system is that the PSMs can possibly be land applied to provide valuable nutrients for crop production.

1080450,Tracing Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Using Hyperspectral Indices in an Alpine Deciduous Forest,2020,Jia Jin and Bayu Arief Pratama and Quan Wang,12,Remote Sensing,7,1124,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Leaf photosynthetic parameters are important in understanding the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle. Conventional approaches to obtain information on the parameters usually involve long-term field work. even for one leaf sample. and are. thus. only applicable to a small area. The utilization of hyperspectral remote sensing especially of various vegetation indices is a promising approach that has been attracting increasing attention recently. However. most hyperspectral indices are only applicable to a specific area and specific forest stands. depending heavily on the conditions from which the indices are developed. In this study. we tried to develop new hyperspectral indices for tracing the two critical photosynthetic parameters (the maximum rate of carboxylation. V cmax and the maximum rate of electron transport. J max) that are at least generally applicable for alpine deciduous forests. based on original hyperspectral reflectance. first-order derivatives. and apparent absorption spectra. In total. ten types of hyperspectral indices were screened to identify the best indices. and their robustness was determined using the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) and Akaike’s Information Criterion corrected (AICc). The result revealed that the double differences (DDn) type of indices using the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region based on the first-order derivatives spectra performed best among all indices. The specific DDn type of indices obtained the RPD values of 1.43 (R 2= 0.51) for V cmax and 1.68 (R 2= 0.64) for J max. respectively.

However. low cell persistence post-transplantation remains a bottleneck hindering the approach. Here. we present a novel strategy to overcome the low engraftment of PSC-CMs during the early post-transplantation phase into the myocardium of both healthy and cryoinjured syngeneic mice. METHODS: Adult murine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and PSC-CMs were co-cultured on thermo-responsive polymers and later detached through temperature reduction. resulting in the protease-free generation of cell clusters (micro-tissues) composed of both cells types. Micro-tissues were transplanted into healthy and cryo-injured murine hearts. Short term cell retention was quantified by real-time-PCR. Longitudinal cell tracking was performed by bioluminescence imaging for four weeks. Transplanted cells were further detected by immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections. RESULTS: We demonstrated that in vitro grown micro-tissues consisting of PSC-CMs and MSCs can increase cardiomyocyte retention by> 10fold one day post-transplantation. but could not fully rescue a further cell loss between day 1 and day 2.

The present work was investigated the hemodynamic and renal effects of both ET-1 and Ang II on 2K1C rats. The design of this study included five groups of rats: Group 1 Sham rats. Group 2 Normotensive rats (2K1C (n)). Group 3 two kidney one clip hypertensive rats (2K1C (h)). Group 4 two kidney one clip hypertensive rats+ Bosentan (2K1C (h)+ Bosentan). and Group 5 two kidney one clip hypertensive rats+ Losartan (2K1C (h)+ Losartan). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly elevated in 2K1C (h) rats from third to sixth week after surgery compared with control rats. SBP significantly fell in bosentan and losartan treated rats. Serum nitric oxide (NO) level in hypertensive rats was slightly decreased. whereas in losartan group it was significantly increased. Serum malonaldehyde (MDA) significantly increased in bosentan treated rats as compared to hypertensive rats. Bosentan administration caused a markedly increased in Na+ excretion rate compared with 2K1C (h) rats in week four after surgery.

Two forms of whey; untreated (crude) whey containing 5% lactose and treated whey (deproteinized and concentrated to 14% lactose) were utilized. Fermentation processes were performed by two strains of Kluyveromyces marxianus and four strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which were previously recognized as ethanol-producing strains. Effects of different initial pH values. as well as. external supplementation of treated whey by four different nitrogen sources on the rate of ethanol production by two of the highest producing strains were also investigated. All the studied yeast strains were able to grow and produce ethanol from both crude and treated whey. Levels of ethanol production ranged between 3.4-18.5 g/l and 24.11-57.66 g/l from crude and treated whey. respectively. The most suitable initial pH maximizing ethanol yield was 5.5 and the best added nitrogen source was yeast extract. Maximum ethanol levels produced by K. marxianus ZMS3GU133329 and S. cerevisiae EC1118 from treated whey adjusted to pH 5.5 and supplemented by 0.3% yeast extract reached to 69.85 and 65.36 g/L. corresponding to 97.8 and 91.4% of the theoretical values. respectively.

1080490,Inhibition of fungal growth and Fusarium toxins by selected cultures of lactic acid bacteria,2014,NH Gomah and ANA Zohri,7,J. Microbial. Biochem. Technol. S,,,,Two species of Lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus paracasie subsp. paracasie) were tested for their ability to inhibit growth and mycotoxins production by three species of Fusarium.(F. graminearum. F. culmorum and F. proliferation) which are the main producers of mycotoxins deoxynivalenol. zearalenone and fumonisin B1. respectively. L. paracasie subsp. paracasie was found to be effective in reducing the amount of toxins produced. although fungal growth was not affected. The inhibition levels of Deoxynivalenol. Zearalenone and Fumonisin B1 production reached to 56.8. 73.0 and 76.5%. respectively. Meanwhile. L. rhamnosus showed the highest inhibitory activity against both fungal growth and mycotoxins production. It completely suppressed mycelium growth of all the studied Fusarium species and consequently. no toxin was produced in the presence of this bacterium. The obtained results confirm that. selected species of Lactic acid bacteria may be successfully used as a biological control agent of food contamination with molds and mycotoxins.

The disposal of these materials is a source of environmental pollution and recourses loss. Recycling of expired dairy products is the ideal practical solution for an integrated ecosystem. Thus. a greenhouse trails were carried out to investigate the effectiveness of natural fertilizer extracted from expired dairy products. Expired dairy products powder (EDPP) was applied to wheat (Triticum aestivum vulgar) plants grown on pots filled with a sandy soil. The experiment contained three treatments:(C) control without any fertilization.(IF) inorganic fertilization (a mixture of inorganic fertilizers at a rate of 500 mg N+ 150 mg P+ 100 mg K/pot) and (EDPP) at a rate of 1%(10 g/pot). EDDP increased the degree of soil aggregation and water holding capacity by 24 and 38% in comparison to inorganic fertilization. The measured soil quality characteristics were improved as a result of the EDDP addition and this led to a remarkable improvement in wheat growth. EDPP elevated all the recoded growth parameters of wheat and increased the total chlorophyll by 22% in comparison to the IF treatment. The application of EDPP significantly raised N. P and K uptake by 45. 73 and 95% compared to IF. EDPP minimized the pH of the soil by 10% and raised the availability of N. P and K by 54. 67 and 14 in comparison to the IF treatment.

NCT01729663). At the end of the 2-year CSF-470 immunization protocol. patient #006 developed several lung and one highly-immune infiltrated subcutaneous melanoma metastases; this later was excised. In this work. we analyzed the changes throughout vaccination of blood immune populations. with special focus on the T-cell repertoire. Immunohistochemistry revealed a marked increase in CD8+. CD4+. and CD20+ lymphocytes infiltrating the metastasis relative to the primary tumor. Lymphocytes were firmly attached to dying-tumor cells surrounded by Granzyme-B granules. Whole exon sequencing assessment indicated a moderate-to-high tumor mutational burden. with BRAFV600E as main oncogenic driver. Mutational signature presented large numbers of mutations at dipyrimidines. typical of melanoma. Relevant tumor and immune-related genes from the subcutaneous metastasis were addressed by RNA-Seq analysis. revealing expression of typical melanoma Ags and proliferative tumor-related genes.

In an adjuvant phase II study vs IFN-α2b. the vaccine significantly prolonged the distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of stages IIB-IIC-III melanoma patients with evidence of the induction of immune responses against vaccine cells. Here. we analyzed the antigens against which the immune response was induced. as well as the Thelper profile and lytic ability of immune cells after CSF-470 treatment. HLA-restricted peptides from tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were selected from TANTIGEN database for 13 evaluable vaccinated patients. Besides. for patient #006 (pt#006). tumor somatic variants were identified by NGS and candidate neoAgs were selected by predicted HLA binding affinity and similarity between wild type (wt) and mutant peptides. The patient`s PBMC reactivity against HLA-restricted TAA-derived peptides was detected by IFNγ-ELISPOT. with a progressive increase in the number of spots throughout vaccination protocol. ELISPOT response correlated with DTH to CSF-470 vaccine cells. Early upregulation of GATA-3 and Foxp3 mRNA. as well as an increase in CD4+IL4+cells. was associated with a low DMFS. Also. IFNγ response against 9/73 predicted neoAgs was evidenced. In vitro. we verified that vaccine-stimulated T cells lysed autologous tumor cells.

It begins by building feature-wise gaussian kernel functions. Then by a constrained linear combination of the feature-wise kernels. we aim to increase the Kernel Target Alignment to obtain a new optimized custom kernel. The linear combination results in a sparse solution where only few kernels survive to improve KTA and consequently a reduced feature subset is obtained. Reducing considerably the original gene set allow to study deeper the selected genes for clinical purposes. The higher the KTA obtained. the better the feature selection. since we want to build custom kernels to use them for classification purposes later. The final kernel after optimizing the KTA is built by a linear combination of ‘Ki’ kernels. each one associated to a μi coefficient.

This group of closely linked loci produces gene products which are important inimmune function in a variety of species. Loci of the MHC fall into three classes: class I loci. which regulate antigen recognition by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes; class II loci. which govern antigen recognition by other lymphocytes; and class III loci. which encode complement components 6. In cattle. the bovine lymphocyte antigen A locus (BoLA-A) 7 codes for class I lymphocyte antigens. which are present on all peripheral blood lymphocytes. This considerable variation suggests the potential of the BoLA-A locus as a marker for various traits. Classification of the different types of BoLA is important for analyzing how the immune system will act in different situation. and can help to differentiate therapies for different cattle. for example. in the creation of different vaccines for each type.

INO1 encodes inositol-3-phosphate synthase. which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of inositol. a key player in phospholipid biosynthesis. Herein. we had demonstrated that the recruitment of histone acetylases Gcn5p and Esa1p mainly relied on the presence of transcriptional activator Ino2p during INO1 activation.

INO1 encodes a key enzyme required for the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylinositol. Induction of INO1 resulted in acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 at the INO1 promoter and sequences farther downstream in the coding region. suggesting a gene-wide acetylation in response to transcriptional activation. Such chromatin remodeling activity requires the presence of transcriptional activator Ino2p. This indicates that histone acetylation is an activator-dependent event. Furthermore. the increase of histone acetylation is due to the increase of acetylation levels per nucleosome rather than the increase of nucleosome density. Therefore. these observations constitute evidence for the molecular mechanism of the correlation between histone acetylation and INO1 activity.,True,iRcGsnMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,12,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X0902436X,616088714435284773,/scholar?cites=616088714435284773,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48272205/j.bbrc.2009.12.06320160823-28017-1nifhjq.pdf,0,0,0

In view of the lack of specific antibacterial studies reported on the isolated compounds. this study was undertaken to evaluate its antibacterial potential against selected Streptococcus species. The antibacterial activity of phytochemicals (isopteropodine and pteropodine) as well as antibiotics (amoxicillin. cephradine. cloxacillin. oxacillin and penicillin) was evaluated with three oral bacteria (Streptococcus mitis. Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus oralis). In addition. the possible synergistic effects when associated with antibiotics were studied. For the antibacterial assay. the agar-well diffusion method has been employed. The antibacterial activity was expressed as the average diameter of the clear zone inhibition of bacterial growth around the well. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the compounds and antibiotics was determined by broth microdilution assay utilizing 96-well microtitre plate. For the synergistic activity. checkerboard assay has been employed. In this study. only isopteropodine was found to be active against S. mutans with inhibition zone of 13 mm. No growth inhibition was found on pteropodine. Upon MIC determination. the isopteropodine was found to show strong inhibitory properties against S. mutans with MIC value of 31.25 mg/mL. Association of antibiotics and isopteropodine showed synergistic antibacterial activity against S. mutans.

Benguet. Philippines. In this study. strawberry fruits were sampled for its fungal endophytes. These organisms live within the living tissues of plants without causing any immediate and apparent negative effects. The antioxidant activities of fungal endophytes isolated and identified from strawberry fruits were evaluated. Fungal isolates were identified using ITSrDNA. Seven species of endophytes were successfully identified. These species were Sporidiobolus sp.. Rhodotorula sp.. Pilidium concavum. Corynespora cassiicola. Neodeightonia subglobosa. Aspergillus awamori. and Aspergillus sp. Antioxidant activities of these microorganisms were evaluated using ABTS decolorization assay and DPPH radical scavenging assay. Results showed that two species had antioxidant activities comparable to ascorbic acid. These isolates were Aspergillus awamori DT11 and Corynespora cassiicola DT13.

1080542,Back-to-back mechanisms drive actomyosin ring closure during Drosophila embryo cleavage,2016,Zenghui Xue and Anna Sokac,215,The Journal of Cell Biology,3,335-344,The Rockefeller University Press,Contraction of actomyosin rings during cytokinesis is typically attributed to actin filaments sliding toward each other via Myosin-2 motor activity. However. rings constrict in some cells in the absence of Myosin-2 activity. Thus. ring closure uses Myosin-2–dependent and –independent mechanisms. But what the Myosin-2–independent mechanisms are. and to what extent they are sufficient to drive closure. remains unclear. During cleavage in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. actomyosin rings constrict in two sequential and mechanistically distinct phases.

Heat. for example. is a teratogen. Yet how heat affects morphogenesis is poorly understood. Here. we identify a heat-inducible actin stress response (ASR) in Drosophila embryos that is mediated by the activation of the actin regulator Cofilin. Similar to ASR in adult mammalian cells. heat stress in fly embryos triggers the assembly of intra-nuclear actin rods. Rods measure up to a few microns in length. and their assembly depends on elevated free nuclear actin concentration and Cofilin. Outside the nucleus. heat stress causes Cofilin-dependent destabilization of filamentous actin (F-actin) in actomyosin networks required for morphogenesis. F-actin destabilization increases the chance of morphogenesis mistakes. Blocking the ASR by reducing Cofilin dosage improves the viability of heat-stressed embryos. However. improved viability correlates …,True,l_4WwLgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124719302785,11735236698078651296,/scholar?cites=11735236698078651296,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124719302785,0,0,0

Yet. the mechanism behind premature cervical softening/dilation in humans remains unclear. We previously reported the non-pregnant human cervix contains considerably more cervical smooth muscle cells (CSMC) than historically appreciated and the CSMC organization resembles a sphincter. We hypothesize that premature cervical dilation leading to sPTB may be due to (1) an inherent CSMC contractility defect resulting in sphincter failure and/or (2) altered cervical extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity which influences CSMC contractility. To test these hypotheses. we utilized immunohistochemistry to confirm this CSMC phenotype persists in the human pregnant cervix and then assessed in vitro arrays of contractility (F: G actin ratios.

North Carolina. USA is described. Between June 2007 and June 2010 monthly aerial and shipboard line-transect surveys were conducted along ten 74km transects placed perpendicular to the shelf break. In total 42.676km of aerial trackline (218 sightings) and 5.209km of vessel trackline (100 sightings) were observed. Seven species of cetaceans were observed. but the fauna was dominated strongly by common bottlenose and Atlantic spotted dolphins. Both species were present year-round in the study area. Using photo-identification techniques. five bottlenose dolphins and one spotted dolphin were resighted during the three-year period. In general. the abundance of cetaceans in Onslow Bay was low and too few sightings were made to estimate monthly abundances for species other than bottlenose and spotted dolphins. Maximum monthly abundances of bottlenose and spotted dolphins were 4.100 (95% CI: 1.300–9.400) in May 2010 and 6.000 (95% CI: 2.500–17.400) in March 2009. respectively. Bottlenose dolphins were found throughout the study area. although they were encountered most frequently just off the shelf break.

However. rapid cooling of water temperatures in the fall can be detrimental to their survival in this region. This study reports upon all known manatee sightings (n= 211) and strandings (n= 9) from 1991 to 2012 in North Carolina and Virginia. The goals were to describe spatial and temporal patterns of manatee habitat use and mortality and relate those patterns to seasonal water temperatures. and to develop a finer-scale understanding of environmental temperatures across the region by deploying temperature data loggers at multiple sites throughout inland and coastal waterways. Although sightings were opportunistically gathered and. thus. not corrected for effort. they reveal a consistent picture of manatee presence in the mid-Atlantic. In both states. sightings were most common from June to October when water temperatures were above 20 C. Sightings in North Carolina were most common in the Intracoastal Waterway (27%). and in rivers and creeks (46%) in Virginia. Fine-scale temperature data collected throughout the region demonstrated highly variable. declining water temperatures in late fall. with temperatures dropping by as much as 1.35 C/d. Manatee sightings decreased precipitously with water temperature in November. while strandings increased. The results of this study demonstrate that manatees are predictably found in North Carolina and Virginia throughout the late spring. summer. and fall.

Virginia and Onslow Bay. North Carolina. These surveys were conducted year-round in 1998 and 1999 and provided baseline data on the occurrence and distribution of marine mammals and sea turtles at these two sites.In 2005 a consortium of academic institutions. including Duke University. UNCW. the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of St. Andrews. was contracted to develop a monitoring program to assess the possible impact of US Navy training and testing activities on marine mammals and sea turtles at a proposed USWTR site in Onslow Bay. North Carolina. Simulation models. parameterized using data from the earlier aerial surveys. indicated that it would be very difficult. if not impossible. to detect any effects of potentially harmful training activities on populations of marine mammals and sea turtles in Onslow Bay. Model results suggested that. in the absence of daily sampling. traditional surveys would provide insufficient statistical power to detect even the worst possible effects of training activities. Given the results of this simulation exercise. the consortium decided against implementing a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) assessment and. instead designed a monitoring program that would improve understanding of the occurrence. distribution and density of marine mammals and sea turtles in the area.,True,8B1B_8AAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://www.navymarinespeciesmonitoring.us/files/8315/5717/2215/Foley_et_al._2019_-_JAX_Aerial_Final.pdf,,,,https://www.navymarinespeciesmonitoring.us/files/8315/5717/2215/Foley_et_al._2019_-_JAX_Aerial_Final.pdf,0,0,0

Plant  based  pig  feeds  contain  significant  quantities  of  ph osp horus . essential for animal health and performance. but which is locked - up in phytic  acid and associated phytate salt s ( only around 30 % digestible ) .  Since the 1990’s.  phytase  enzymes have been added to non - ruminant feeds to enhance phytate digestibility . Recent  e videnc e suggests  that feeding  super  doses  of phytase increases growth  performance  beyond  that a ttributable to phosphorus release alone. In the UK.  therapeutic  levels of ZnO are often  prescribed to  prevent  and  treat  post - weaning diarrhoea in  newly  weaned  pigs.  th ough  some  evidence suggests zinc  may  reduce  the  phosphorus  releasing  efficacy  of  phytase. Improving the efficiency of pig production . reducing environmental pollution and  maximising the use of n on - renewable resources  may help contribute to a sustainable an d  secure global food chain.  The objective of this  study was to evaluate the  optimal strategy  for using phytase in  weaner pig diets. in  conjunction with pharmaceutical ZnO .  Four  live pig  experiments were  conducted  to  quantify the  growth  response  to  increasi ng  dietary  phosphorus. identify ‘extra phosphoric’ effects  associated with phytase  super  dosing and to  evaluate  this  response  in ZnO medicated feed .  Resulting r ecommendations  are to  super  dose phytase  (2000  - 8000 FTU/ kg ) for two weeks post - weaning; reduci ng to 100 0 FTU/kg  in  the  third  week  post - weaning to  fa cilitate  bone  mineralisation.

The traditional method followed for years is not only expensive and time consuming but it also needs lot of effort to be put in and in spite of that at times it proves to be unfavourable and unpredictable too. The recent approach to optimise ie to achieve the best combination of product and process characteristics under the given conditions is by using Design of Experiment (DoE). Design of Experiment (DoE) is an organised approach to determine the relationship between the factors (Xs) affecting a process and the output of that process (Ys). The recent optimisation methodologies include various approaches that come under the 2 main categories namely. simultaneous optimisation and sequential optimisation.

The 74 years of our literature survey tracked over 2500 papers on botanical insecticides published between 1945 and 2019 (Web of Science database). Such a survey allowed meta-analyses to recognize current status and biases of the studies providing important insights into the research topic. They include the recognition of the exponential growth of such studies since the 1990s. the prevalent interest on the Meliaceae plant species and a dozen additional families. although some 190 families have been investigated. The arthropods targeted by such studies were pest species (ca. 95%) with rather little attention devoted to non-target species (p< 0.001). This bias is followed by another one—mortality assessments are prevalent among target and non-target arthropod species when contrasted with sublethal assessments (p< 0.01). These omissions are pivotal. as they fail to recognize that sublethal effects may be as important or even more important than mortality. and that initial insecticide deposits quickly degrade over time leading to prevailing sublethal exposure. Furthermore. although the target of control is limited to few species. non-target species will be exposed and as such need to be factored into consideration. Thus. these biases in studies of botanical insecticides incur in knowledge gaps with potential consequences for the practical use of these compounds as pest management tools.

We used a combination of species tree and phylogeographic methods to describe the spatio-temporal changes through time and across space (= species diffusion) in a clade of seven West African lizard species in the Agama agama species group. A Bayesian species tree diffusion approach was used to compare the relative rates at which species ranges changed across the landscape. We found that some species have high diffusion rates characterized by significant movement in their range location and minor changes to their overall range size. whereas other species show little movement in their range centre with an exponential increase in range size.

Recently. experts have made efforts to exploit microorganisms intended for recovering CO 2 from power plants.Materials and methods: To achieve this purpose. we studied the growth response of the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis PCC9108 under different concentrations of carbon dioxide (ranging from 0.036% to 10%) and flue gas in a bench-scale system. Preparation of different concentrations of CO 2 and injection into Erlenmeyer flasks was performed by a system including air compressor. CO 2 capsule. pressure gauge and flow meter.Results: The main goal of studying this paper is a survey of organism's potential to grow by generated CO 2 from flue gas of power plant. It already had the potential and highest biomass production recorded at 8% CO 2 (v/v). Also we proved that S. platensis PCC9108 can be grown under flue gas. although biomass production decreased fairly. Total lipid content of algae interestingly enhanced with elevated CO 2 levels from ambient air to 4% and 6% which ranged from 14.5 to 15.8 and 16 dry weight (wt.)% respectively. In contrast. total protein content illustrated no difference between all treatment and its value was about 46 wt.%.Discussion and conclusion: The results of present study suggested that understudied S. platensis PCC9108 is appropriate for mitigating CO 2 because of its carbon fixation ability.

The glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have an important role in the    detoxification of a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens. Studies have    been indicated that genetic variation in the GST gene family may lead to    susceptibility in HL. Hereby. we investigated the association of GSTT1 and    GSTM1 null genotypes with HL in the Iranian population. This case-control    study consisted of 76 patients suffering from HL and 120 healthy individuals    as a control group. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyping of GSTT1 and    GSTM1 genes for the identification of their null genotypes was carried out    using multiplex PCR method. Our findings indicated that GSTM1 null genotype    is associated with risk of developing HL in our population (P=0.025;    OR=2.00; 95%CI=1.110- 3.602); however. no association was found for GSTT1    null genotype. Our study also showed that the GSTM1 null genotype increased    the risk of disease in the individuals younger than 45 years. and it had a    positive association with low ESR.

This kind of animal could be generally seen living around rice fields in Thailand since 40 years ago. However. there are currently few of them left and raised in zoo captivity. This research aims to compare semen quality of the Eastern Sarus Crane bred in the aviary environment (captive condition) in the Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo for three periods (before breeding season. during breeding season and end of breeding season) and to test by using artificial insemination technique on four female Eastern Sarus Cranes. The results of the study were as follows; the general semen quality of the male Eastern Sarus Cranes examined was at normal levels in all terms of evaluation during mating. The semen quality after mating was ranked second. Before mating. fresh semen was found to have weak alkalinity (pH7-8); the average sperm concentration ranged between 25-47x10 and the concentration was high after breeding season. The 7 abnormality value of spermatozoa morphology was acceptable and it is approximate in every studied season. On the other hand. the test using artificial insemination technique on female Eastern Sarus Cranes still proved unsuccessful. Therefore. this research points out that additional study about Eastern Sarus Crane should be considered in order to find out guidelines for conservation. productivity and extinction prevention.,True,buTJDXwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Watee_Kongbuntad2/publication/260419078_Semen_Quality_and_Artificial_Insemination_of_Eastern_Sarus_Crane_Grus_antigone_shapii_Linn_In_Captive_Condition_in_the_Nakhon_Ratchasima_Zoo_Thailand/links/0046353114f41031d0000000.pdf,6938575199377749768,/scholar?cites=6938575199377749768,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Watee_Kongbuntad2/publication/260419078_Semen_Quality_and_Artificial_Insemination_of_Eastern_Sarus_Crane_Grus_antigone_shapii_Linn_In_Captive_Condition_in_the_Nakhon_Ratchasima_Zoo_Thailand/links/0046353114f41031d0000000.pdf,0,0,0

Allele frequency analysis gave no clear indications of a genetic subdivision in the species within the Northeast Atlantic. but some geographic trends were seen: Haddock from Icelandic waters differed somewhat at one locus. The allele frequency differences between the Icelandic sample and the other samples were however small. and large samples. which provide increased statistical power. seem to be necessary in order to enable population discrimination.

1080699,Genetic variability at isozyme loci in haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) from Norwegian fjord and coastal waters,1995,M Giaever and J Forthun and J Mork,16,ICES Concil Meeting 1995/G,,,,Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) is a bottomdwelling marine teleost with a discontinuous east-west distribution in the North Atlantic. In the Northwest Atlantic it is found from Cape Hatteras to Newfoundland and in the Northeast Atlantic from Portugal to Iceland. Spitsbergen and Novaja Zemlja. The most important East Atlantic spawning grounds are off the coast of mid-and northern Norway. the North Sea. at the Faroes. and south-west of Iceland. Eggs and larvae are pelagic. Specimens usually reach sexual maturity at an age of 3-4 years (30-40 cm length) in the North Sea and 4-8 years (40-65 cm length) in North Norway. The haddock is commercially very important in the North Atlantic. and annual catches constitute several hundred thousand tons.Early studies of haddock population structure. based on morphometrics and meristics (Martin 1953. Templeman 1953. and Grosslein 1962 in the West Atlantic; Raitt 1936. Fraser 1958. and Lee 1974 in the East Atlantic). concluded with the existence of distinct stocks at different banks. Due to high mortality of tagged specimens and hence low recapture rates. tagging experiments have not been very successful in haddock. Results from such studies are thus not available as a control of results from morphometric studies (pers. comm: 0. R Godø. Institute of Marine Research. Bergen. Norway). Also. population genetic studies on haddock have been few. Zwanenburg et al.(1992) investigated haddock stock structure on West Atlantic banks by means ofmtDNA polymorphisms. No si cant heterogeneity between banks was revealed.

Karoulias and Nandaraj Taye and Sarah Stanley and Dirk Hubmacher,,Biomolecules,,,,Secreted a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS) proteases play crucial roles in tissue development and homeostasis. The biological and pathological functions of ADAMTS proteases are determined broadly by their respective substrates and their interactions with proteins in the pericellular and extracellular matrix. For some ADAMTS proteases. substrates have been identified and substrate cleavage has been implicated in tissue development and in disease. For other ADAMTS proteases. substrates were discovered in vitro. but the role of these proteases and the consequences of substrate cleavage in vivo remains to be established. Mutations in ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 cause Weill–Marchesani syndrome (WMS). a congenital syndromic disorder that affects the musculoskeletal system (short stature. pseudomuscular build. tight skin). the eyes (lens dislocation). and the heart (heart valve abnormalities). WMS can also be caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1). which suggests that ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 cooperate with fibrillin-1 in a common biological pathway during tissue development and homeostasis.

Limb-innervating lateral motor column MNs (LMC-MNs) travel substantially to innervate distal limb mesenchyme. How LMC-MNs fine-tune the balance between survival and apoptosis while wiring the sensorimotor circuit en route remains unclear. Here. we show that the mir-17∼92 cluster is enriched in embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived LMC-MNs and that conditional mir-17∼92 deletion in MNs results in the death of LMC-MNs in vitro and in vivo. mir-17∼92 overexpression rescues MNs from apoptosis. which occurs spontaneously during embryonic development. PTEN is a primary target of mir-17∼92 responsible for LMC-MN degeneration.

Limb-innervating lateral motor column MNs (LMC-MNs) seem to be particularly vulnerable and are among the first MNs affected in ALS. Here. we report association of this differential susceptibility with reduced expression of the mir-17∼92 cluster in LMC-MNs prior to disease onset. Reduced mir-17∼92 is accompanied by elevated nuclear PTEN in spinal MNs of presymptomatic SOD1G93A mice. Selective dysregulation of the mir-17∼92/nuclear PTEN axis in degenerating SOD1G93A LMC-MNs was confirmed in a double-transgenic embryonic stem cell system and recapitulated in human SOD1+/L144F-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs.

J. Bot,6,2259-2263,,This article represents data on determination of heavy metals (Pb. Cd. Zn. Cu. Mn. Co. Ni) in the samples of dominant plants and soils of Atyrau region in Kazakhstan. High population density and enhanced agriculture and industrial activity are main reasons for pollution and degradation of vegetation in these areas. Accumulation of heavy metals in forage plants and subsequent transfer of metals along the food chain might have a negative impact on the health of the population. The areas for sample collection were as follows: Point 1 (Atyrau. farm. Ulan). Point 2 (Kulsary. v. Turgysba) and Point 3 (v. Inder. farm. Isayev). The ability for heavy metal accumulation was different in various plant species. It was revealed that Artemisia terraealbae was able to accumulate the highest concentration of the heavy metals namely lead. zinc. nickel and manganese compared with the other species. Tamarix ramosissima and Ceratocarpus arenarius were distinctive as having the least amount of heavy metals compared with the other species growing in similar environmental conditions. In all the studied areas the content of heavy metals was within the maximum permissible level. However. it was observed that the insignificant evaluation of zinc and cobalt up to 1.09-1.72 MPC might be related to physiographic and geologic factors of the studied area.,True,u1n3nCQAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,7,https://www.pakbs.org/pjbot/papers/1531143355.pdf,8819627386365652382,/scholar?cites=8819627386365652382,,https://www.pakbs.org/pjbot/papers/1531143355.pdf,0,0,0

WHITE COLLAR (WC) complex. the positive element of the Neurospora circadian system. is responsible for stimulation of frq transcription. We report that a C2H2 finger domain-containing protein IEC-1 and its associated chromatin remodeling complex INO80 play important roles in normal Neurospora circadian clock function. In iec-1KO strains. circadian rhythms are abolished. and the frq transcript levels are increased compared to that of the wild-type strain. Similar results are observed in mutant strains of the INO80 subunits. Furthermore. ChIP data show that recruitment of the INO80 complex to the frq promoter is IEC-1-dependent. WC-mediated transcription of frq contributes to the rhythmic binding of the INO80 complex at the frq promoter. As demonstrated by ChIP analysis. the INO80 complex is required for the re-establishment of the dense chromatin environment at the frq promoter. In addition. WC-independent frq transcription is present in ino80 mutants.

The received data give reason to think that the number of Tand B-lymphocytes in the blood of carp fish and their functional activity to a large extent depends on the influence of seasonal factors (temperature of the medium. oxygen concentration. duration of light day). This is points to the probable increase in the number of T-lymphocytes (common. active. theophylline-sensitive and theophylline-resistant) and a decrease in B-lymphocytes in the blood of investigated fish in the summer and. especially in the autumn period of research.

Historically. it inhabited the Aral Sea and deltas of inflowing rivers (Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya). At the beginning of the 1960s it was introduced into water bodies of the middle Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya from the Ural River. The present study was aimed to evaluate the current genetic status of wild pike-perch populations from different water bodies using nine recently isolated species-specific microsatellite markers. The three examined Uzbek pike-perch populations expressed significantly higher average numbers of alleles per locus (5.56 to 14.22) than three year-classes of a German wild population (3.11 to 3.78) included for comparison. On the other hand. average observed and expected heterozygosities were not significantly different in both regions (0.743 and 0.760 in Uzbek pike-perch; 0.576 and 0.471 in German pike-perch). After sequential Bonferroni corrections all Uzbek populations were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic differentiation between all populations as estimated by FST values was statistically significant. Pike-perch from Amu-Darya River delta and Tudakul reservoir were less differentiated from each other probably due to gene flow between them (both water bodies are connected) whereas the more distinct Syr-Darya River population showed indication for introgression with non-native individuals stocked in that region.

Lake Arnasay. Charvak reservoir (Syr Darya River Basin). Zarafshan River. and the Lower Amu Darya. Gonad samples for histological analysis were preserved in Bouin’s solution. For tissue processing. ethanol-butanol dehydration and paraffin wax embedding was used. Tissue sections were stained with Heidenhain's iron haematoxylin. Reproductive capacity was characterized by absolute and relative indices: absolute fecundity (AF). relative fecundity (RF). gonadosomatic index (GSI). and maturity coefficient (GSIMC). The last two similar indices were calculated as the ratio of the gonad weight to the body weight without viscera for GSI and to the total body weight for GSIMC. respectively. Average absolute fecundity was estimated by adding the direct calculation of individual absolute fecundity divided by the sample size.Females of most sawbelly populations in Uzbekistan mature at the age of 2-3 years and a length of 8-10cm.

Food safety consists of protecting food from all contamination and preventing foodborne illnesses. Nonetheless. in recent years. there has been an increase in foodborne illness and foodborne outbreaks-defined as where two or more people suffer the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink worldwide (Denis et al. 2016; Crowe et al. 2012; Keener et al. 2014).The nature of food safety is varied. complex. and immense. The safety of the food products provided to consumers has been the primary responsibility of food producers. distributors. and vendors (Denis et al. 2016). Food products often travel through global supply chains to reach consumers (Taylor & Hoffmann 2001). The European Union's Rapid Alert Systems for Food and Feed (RASFF). for example. identified almost 3.000 high-risk food products in 2010. half of which were foods produced outside the EU (Zhang et al. 2012). More people are also eating outside their homes. In the US. restaurants are the places of preparation for the majority of foodborne outbreaks (Gould et al. 2013). Researchers emphasize the importance of consumers' personal decisions in food selection. preparation. storage. and service to reduce the risk of foodborne illness and disease (Cody 2012; Fraser & Miller 2014).,True,_0l73W4AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,http://www.istl.org/18-winter/internet.html,,,,http://www.istl.org/18-winter/internet.html,0,0,0

Oreochromis niloticus. diets. A series of four experiments were conducted in a recirculation system using juvenile O. niloticus. The fish were fed diets containing the oilseed cakes at dietary inclusion levels ranging from 20% to 50%. Diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous (32g 100 g-1). isolipidic (10g 100 g-1) and isoenergetic (18 kJ g-1) and fed to juvenile Nile tilapia at 4-10% of their body weight per day for a period of 8 weeks. Niger seed cake (NSC) and linseed cake (LSC) were used individually or as mixtures to test for their effect on Nile tilapia growth and feed utilization. Also of interest was to compare digestibility and feeding values of NSC and LSC with that of soybean cake (SBC). the best plant protein source. Proximate analysis showed that Niger seed cake (NSC) and linseed cake (LSC) had 324.2 and 310.0 g kg-1 crude protein. 201.1 and 136.3 g kg-1 crude fibre and 18.1 and 18.6 kJ g-1 gross energy. respectively. Nutrient digestibility of these oilseed cakes suggested that Nile tilapia may be able to utilize NSC better as dietary protein source due to a reasonably high protein digestibility coefficient (72.6%) than linseed cake (62.4%). Of the three oilseed cakes (NSC. LSC and SBC) tested soybean cake (SBC) produced significantly (P< 0.05) the highest nutrient digestibility coefficients.

1080819,Manual for production of Chamo strain Nile tilapia fingerlings and preparation of fish feeds from locally available material,2020,Tewodros Abate and Abebe Getahun and Akewake Geremew and Gebermedihin Ambaw and John W Recha,,,,,CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change. Agriculture and Food Security,Climate change has resulted in increased local temperatures that in turn have increased evapotranspiration. and negatively affected the breeding grounds of several important fish species due to reduction in the water levels of water bodies (Ficke et al. 2007). The rise in local temperature also affects the physico-chemical properties of water. including temperature. pH. dissolved oxygen. salinity. and concentration of different ions in water bodies (El Morhit & Mouhir 2014). These changes negatively affect the physiological (e.g. reproduction) and behavioral dynamics of fish as well as their natural feed leading to lower production of capture fish (Chabot & Guénette 2013).  To increase production of capture fish. there is need for a reliable method for mass production of fry. Although tilapia breed freely in ponds. it is important for farmers (producers) to consider using properly produced fingerlings. However. there are quality challenges with semi-natural or hormone-induced propagation of fingerlings. Quality fingerlings in tilapia aquaculture are needed for improved production. For this reason. it is advisable for farmers to generate their own fingerlings if they cannot ascertain the quality of those from other sources. Poor fingerlings result in poor harvests. Therefore. artificial propagation under controlled environmental conditions in a hatchery has become a necessity to ensure production en-masse of fry and fingerlings.,True,YOP1i6wAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC,0,https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/110451,,,,https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/110451/Manual%20on%20Fish%20Production%20-%20Final.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Exposure to toxic pollutants from solid biomass fuel in the indoor environment is the main risk factor. In Ethiopia. where more than 90% of population use this energy source and the disease is one of the top health problems. there is a paucity of evidence on the association of cooking places with the disease based on nationally representative data. Therefore. the current study is intended to at assess the association of food cooking places with acute respiratory infection based on a large-scale and time varying data.Methods: The data of Ethiopian Demographic and health surveys collected in 2005. 2011 and 2016 were used for this study. The data were obtained via online registration and analyzed using a multilevel analysis. The “svy” command in Stata was used to weight the data to adjust for cluster sampling design.Result: The total number of children included in the analysis was 30895. with 9.517 from 2005. 11.176 from 2011 and 10. 291 from 2016 survey. In total. 11.9% of children had an acute lower respiratory infection with 12.7%. 11.9% and 11.1% respectively in 2005. 2011 and 2016. In 2005. 71% of mothers cooked food inside the house and it declined to 43% in 2016. The risk of the infection to children whose mother cooked food outside the house compared to inside the house was 68% less likely (AOR= 0.32. 95% CI= 0.10. 0.98).

Myofilament calcium sensitivity was estimated using simultaneous contractile recordings versus [Ca2+]i. Arterial blood was measured in intact and irradiated rats before and after hMSC administration. Stimulation of isolated SMC from the control group of animals with depolarizing voltage steps showed that outward K+ currents sensitive to the BKCa inhibitor paxilline were expressed. Outward currents in SMC obtained from irradiated animals were significantly reduced on the 30th day of post-irradiation. Irradiation led to a significant elevation in arterial blood pressure and reduced ACh-induced relaxation responses in irradiated rats as compared with the control group.

Adenylate cyclase activity (ACA) in the Lymnaea membrane depended on the GTP. stimulated and inhibited by different well known mediators. dopamine action being one of them. DA produced a stimulatory and inhibitory action on ACA. Direction of the DA action depended on the GTP concentration: at lower concentration of the GTP DA was a stimulator of ACA. at higher--an inhibitor.

These data emphasize the importance of non-radial glial stem cells in the neurogenesis of adult animals. in particular fish. However. the distribution. cell cycle features. and molecular markers of NE cells and glial progenitors in fish are still poorly understood at the postembryonic stages of ontogenesis. Fetalization predominates in the ontogenetic development of salmon fish. which is associated with a delay in development and preservation of the features of the embryonic structure of the brain during the first year of life. In the present work. we studied the features of proliferation and the migration of neuronal precursors in the pallial proliferative zone of juvenile Oncorhynchus masou. The aim of the study is a comparative analysis of the distribution of glial-type aNSCs markers. such as vimentin and glial fibrillar acid protein GFAP. as well as the proliferation marker BrdU and migratory neuronal precursor doublecortin. in the pallial zone of the intact telencephalon in juvenile O. masou normal and after mechanical injury. The immunohistochemical IHC labeling with antibodies to vimentin.

The HIPV production in plants is partly mediated by jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) was proved to be a suitable agent for induction of HIPVs similar to those induced by herbivorous insects in many plant species. We studied the effects of methyl jasmonate on volatile emission and natural enemy attraction using mature grey willow (Salix cinerea) under natural conditions in Czech Republic. We treated 12 experimental shrubs with 30 mM MeJA and completed the experiment with 12 control shrubs.

Oak Bodyguards. to assess the ability of schoolchildren to accurately estimate the strength of biotic interactions in terrestrial ecosystems. We used standardized protocols to estimate attack rates on artificial caterpillars and insect herbivory on oak leaves. We compared estimates made by schoolchildren with estimates made by professional scientists who had been trained in predation and herbivory assessments (henceforth. trained scientists). and trained scientists’ estimates with those made by professional scientists with or without expertise (untrained) in predation or herbivory assessment. Compared with trained scientists. both schoolchildren and untrained professional scientists overestimated attack rates. but assessments made by the latter were more consistent. Schoolchildren tended to overestimate insect herbivory. as did untrained professional scientists.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Neurogranin (Ng) is a brain‐specific postsynaptic calmodulin‐binding protein involved in synaptic activity‐dependent plasticity. In the adult olfactory bulb (OB). Ng is expressed by a large population of GABAergic interneurons in the granule cell layer. We show here that. during postnatal development. Ng is also expressed by OB neurons in the superficial external plexiform layer (sEPL) and glomerular layer (GL). These Ng‐positive neurons display morphological and neurochemical features of superficial and external tufted cells.

Embryos of many species display a high degree of plasticity in response to developmental environments. which places maternal nesting behavior under strong selective pressure. particularly in temporally changing environments. Nesting behavior varies widely across taxa that exhibit diverse reproductive strategies. The brown anole (Anolis sagrei). for example. lays one egg every 7–10 days across an extended reproductive season from April to October. This aspect of their reproduction provides an opportunity to examine temporal shifts in nesting behavior and its consequences on egg survival and offspring development under seasonally changing climatic conditions.

Changes in the structure of lever systems may be coupled with changes in muscle use and give rise to novel muscle functions. The two extant turtle lineages. cryptodires and pleurodires. exhibit differences in hindlimb structure. Cryptodires possess the ancestral musculoskeletal morphology. with most hip muscles originating on the pelvic girdle. which is not fused to the shell. In contrast. pleurodires exhibit a derived morphology. in which fusion of the pelvic girdle to the shell has resulted in shifts in the origin of most hip muscles onto the interior of the shell.

These prominent. and often intricate. structures carry a reproductive benefit as weapons in male–male combat and as ornaments to attract females (Emlen 2008). Examples of such structures include male rhinoceros beetles’ large horns (Arrow 1951). which are used during combat for access to females. peacocks’ elaborate tails (Darwin 1871). which are used to court peahens. and male fiddler crabs’ enlarged claws. which are used to fight other males and beckon to females (Crane 1975).

This behaviour may be a consequence of a shortage of preferable nest sites (constraint hypothesis) or an adaptation generated by fitness benefits associated with egg aggregation (adaptive hypothesis). Experimental tests of these hypotheses require information about maternal nest site choice and its fitness consequences. To address these. we studied a lizard (brown anole; Anolis sagrei) that produces single‐egg clutches. but often aggregates eggs in nest sites.

The timing of host behaviour change coincides with the development of infectivity of the parasite to the final host (a piscivorous bird). making it an ideal model for studying the mechanisms of infection-induced behavioural modification. However. whether the loss of host anti-predator behaviour results from direct manipulation by the parasite. or is a by-product (e.g. host immune response) or side effect of infection (e.g. energetic loss). remains controversial. To understand the physiological mechanisms that generate these behavioural changes. we quantified the behavioural profiles of experimentally infected fish and attempted to replicate these in non-parasitized fish by exposing them to treatments including immunity activation and fasting …,True,a31ADeAAAAAJ:KWzIFqRkAKkC,18,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/2/237.abstract,955285487291738810,/scholar?cites=955285487291738810,,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/220/2/237.full.pdf,0,0,0

1080921,Étude des causes proximales des changements de comportement de l'épinoche à trois épines (Gasterosteus aculeatus) par son parasite Schistocephalus solidus,2017,Lucie Grécias,,,,,,Infection with certain parasites coincides with major changes in host behaviour. which has been proposed as an adaptation of parasites in order to increase their transmission rate and thus to be able to complete their life cycle. However. the hypothesis of parasitic manipulation of host behaviour has rarely been demonstrated. In order to better understand these possible adaptive mechanisms. it is necessary to understand the causes of these behavioural changes. At least four hypotheses are possible. These changes may be due to the presence of the parasite alone (parasitic mass). activation of the immune system. energetic drain or modification of the neural environment. My objective was to test the various predictions that stem from these assumptions. These hypotheses have been studied by a targeted experimental approach in order to find the behavioural syndrome of a parasitized host and shed light on its genomic signature. We used as a model the interaction between the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). a bone fish. and its parasite (Schistocephalus solidus). a cestode. This host-parasite pair is found in nature and has been extensively studied in terms of the negative consequences of the infection on the change of behaviour towards a predator. reproduction and growth. Our first approach was to recreate the parasite presence (mass) to observe its potential impact on the stickleback’s behaviours. The mechanical hypothesis tested in this first approach had never been tested before. Our results do not support this hypothesis but are precursors of further studies on the mechanical cause of behavioural changes.

We studied brain gene expression profiles of sticklebacks infected with S. solidus to determine the proximal causes of these behavioural alterations. We show that infected fish have altered expression levels in genes involved in the inositol pathway.

We previously reported that molecular hydrogen (H 2) acts as a therapeutic and preventive antioxidant. Here. we show that preadministration of H 2-dissolved water (HW) suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxin shock in mice. Drinking HW for 3 days before LPS injection prolonged survival in a mouse model of sepsis. The H 2 concentration immediately increased in the liver but not in the kidney after drinking HW. The protective effects of the preadministration of HW on LPS-induced liver injury were examined. Twenty-four hours after LPS injection. preadministration of HW reduced the increase in both apoptosis and oxidative stress.

Specific proteins linked to neurodegenerative disorders are physiologically expressed in MBs. such as APP-derived amyloids (Aβ). whose physiological and pathological roles and interactions with other proteins are not well established in humans. Here. we demonstrate that neuroectodermal organoids can be used to study the Aβ accumulation implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To enhance the process of protein secretion and accumulation. we adopted a chemical strategy of induction to modulate post-translational pathways of APP using an Amyloid-β Forty-Two Inducer named Aftin-5. Secreted. soluble Aβ fragment concentrations were analyzed in MB-conditioned media. An increase in the Aβ42 fragment secretion was observed as was an increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio after drug treatment. which is consistent with the pathological-like phenotypes described in vivo in transgenic animal models and in vitro in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cultures obtained from AD patients. Notably in this context we observe time-dependent Aβ accumulation. which differs from protein accumulation occurring after treatment. We show that mini-brains obtained from a non-AD control cell line are responsive to chemical compound induction. producing a shift of physiological Aβ concentrations. suggesting that this model can be used to identify environmental agents that may initiate the cascade of events ultimately leading to sporadic AD …,True,CUeeQakAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,17,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209150,1474823685348714304,/scholar?cites=1474823685348714304,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209150,0,0,0

These 3D structures hold great potential for the modeling of neurodegenerative diseases and pave the way for personalized medicine. However. as these 3D brain models can express the whole human genetic complexity. it is critical to have access to isogenic minibrains that only differ on specific and controlled genetic variables. Genetic engineering based on retroviral vectors is incompatible with the long-term modeling needed here and implies a risk of random integration while methods using CRISPR-Cas9 are still complex to adapt to stem cells. We demonstrate in this study that our strategy relying on an episomal plasmid vector derived from the Epstein-Barr virus offers a simple and robust approach to avoid the remaining caveats of minibrain models. For this proof-of-concept. we used a normal tau protein with a fluorescent tag and a mutant genetic form (P301S) leading to Fronto-Temporal Dementia. We obtained isogenic cell lines stable for more than 30 passages expressing either forms. We show that the presence of the plasmid in the cells does not interfere with the minibrain differentiation protocol and we obtain the development of a pathologically relevant phenotype in cerebral organoids. with a pathological hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein.

The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is an external fertilizer experiencing intense male-male competition over reproductive opportunities including sperm competition. To compensate for their disadvantage the sneaker males. which often spawn out of synchrony with the female. produce more and faster sperm than the guarding males. We used controlled in vitro fertilization trials with experimentally produced dominant and subordinate. sneaker males to test what effect relative synchrony in gamete release. sperm quality (i.e.. motility and velocity) and sperm quantity have on a male’s fertilization success in pair-wise sperm competitions. When the sneaker males released ejaculates after the guarding male there was no overall difference in fertilization success. The quality (i.e.. motility and velocity) of a male’s sperm relative to that of the competing male was the best predictor of male fertilization success regardless of their mating tactic and spawning synchrony. The relative number of sperm cells also had an effect on fertilization success. but mainly when the dominant and sneaker male ejaculated synchronously. Our close imitation of natural sperm competition in charr shows that the sneaker males of external fertilizing species may fully compensate for their disadvantaged mating role by producing ejaculates of higher quality - an adjustment strangely not met by dominants.,True,HZHB2X4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,12,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2015.00077/full,12114646322599603962,/scholar?cites=12114646322599603962,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2015.00077/full,0,0,0

In polyandry. sperm competition occurs when sperm from two or more males compete to fertilize eggs from a female. Here we review how sperm competition from hatchery origin fish can cause loss of genetic variability in fish populations kept in captivity and in wild populations. In fish hatchery practices. sperm competition occurs in mass spawners that release gametes in tanks. and in artificial fertilizations when pooled semen is used. In mass spawnings sperm competition is difficult to tease apart from pre-mating competition and other post-mating selective mechanisms. whereas. studies focused on the use of pooled semen in different fish species have shown a clear relationship between sperm motility parameters and precedence in fertilization.

Here. spawning behavior of free‐living Arctic charr was video‐recorded. and their reproductive behavior was analyzed. From evaluating 157 spawning events. we observed that females mainly spawned with a guarding male and that the female and the guarding male synchronized timing of gamete release under sperm competition.

One well-documented example is that of the external fertilizing teleost. the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). where individuals becoming dominant reduce sperm production and sperm swimming speed in water compared to subordinates. Here we report how ovarian fluid differentially influences sperm velocity of dominant and subordinate male Arctic charr. That is. sperm from dominant males increase their velocity in water diluted ovarian fluid compared to that observed in water. while sperm from subordinates. on the other hand. decrease velocity in ovarian fluid compared to that observed in water. Thus. subordinates. who invest more resources in their sperm and usually show the highest sperm velocity in water. have lower gains from their investment than dominant males when sperm are swimming in ovarian fluid. In sum. our result suggests that ovarian fluid increase sperm velocity more in dominant males than in subordinate males. Although this finding could partly be caused by cryptic female choice exerted by the ovarian fluid for sperm from dominant males. an alternative and more parsimonious explanation is that sperm from dominant males may simply be better designed for swimming in ovarian fluid compared to sperm from subordinate males.

The administration of buckwheat extracts (both concentrations were 10%) to mice (at the dose 10 mL/kg of body weight) for 21 days significantly decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reduced the amount of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the mouse brain. while catalase (CAT) activity significantly increased. In the mouse liver. the amount of GSH and activity of SOD increased. while the CAT activity after administering buckwheat leaf and flower extracts was lower in experimental mice than in the control group. However. the administration of 10% ethanol (for 21 days) to control animals also had a significant effect on the antioxidant system in brain and liver cells. Experimental animals demonstrated rather marked changes in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT in their liver and brain cells. and changes in the levels of GSH and MDA were observed when compared with the control group.,True,W4h2cWYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,8,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2018/6712407/abs/,17926588286831781028,/scholar?cites=17926588286831781028,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2018/6712407/abs/,0,0,0

The mechanisms of pathological effects of this metal remain elusive. The present study was devoted to evaluate the effect of nickel on the oxidative state of the brain cells of mice and to assess whether zinc as redox state modulator could efficiently protect cells against nickel’s neurotoxicity. As oxidative stress biomarkers in the present study. we have measured the concentrations of reduced glutathione. metallothioneins. and malondialdehyde and the activity of the enzyme δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase. For the single metal exposure. mice were i.p. injected once with solutions of NiCl2 and/or ZnSO4; repeated exposure was performed i.p. injecting metal salt solutions for 14 days (once a day). The control mice received i.p. injections of saline. Results of our study demonstrate that single and 14 days of Ni2+ exposure decreased reduced glutathione and increased malondialdehyde contents in the brain of mice. Repeated Ni2+ administration significantly inhibited δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase while increasing brain metallothionein concentration at both exposure periods. Zinc exhibited a protective effect against nickel-induced glutathione and lipid peroxidation in brain cells of mice at both intervals of time. while repeated exposure to this metal significantly raised the brain metallothionein content. Repeated Zn2+ pretreatment protected δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase from Ni2+-induced inhibition and significantly increased metallothionein concentration at both investigated time intervals.,True,W4h2cWYAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,6,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2019/8549727/abs/,14358545581169187211,/scholar?cites=14358545581169187211,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2019/8549727/abs/,0,0,0

1080977,Avian biodiversity in a pasture-dominated ecosystem,2016,Jason P Hernandez,29,Journal of Caribbean Ornithology,,21-27,,Burgeoning human populations have created many challenges for conservation of biodiversity. as ever-larger areas of land are converted to agricultural and other forms of production. Protected reserves alone are not sufficient to sustain biodiversity in a world of increasing human needs. so it is necessary to understand the extent to which biodiversity can exist within highly altered. agricultural ecosystems. From 11 May to 8 August 2013. bird diversity was surveyed at an agricultural site on Hispaniola. utilized mainly for pasture. and the population and regeneration potential of the royal palm (Roystonea borinquena). a key nest tree species for two abundant bird species. was assessed. The site harbored 33 bird species including 32 resident species (about one-third of Hispaniola’s low-elevation resident land bird species). of which 5 are endemic to Hispaniola. Two of these endemic species. the Palmchat (Dulus dominicus) and the Hispaniolan Woodpecker (Melanerpes striatus). were the predominant species present. Seventy-six percent of species at this site showed an association with trees. The royal palm occurred mainly in wooded riparian corridors. but showed little ability to colonize pastures. suggesting possible declines in future overall tree density at this site. Ensuring adequate tree recruitment is crucial to maintaining biodiversity in agricultural and grazing zones.,True,xCB_chsAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,http://jco.birdscaribbean.org/index.php/jco/article/view/263,10437400791496325971,/scholar?cites=10437400791496325971,,http://jco.birdscaribbean.org/index.php/jco/article/download/263/184,0,0,0

1080979,Priority effects of overwintered Rana tadpoles on larval Southern toad (Bufo terrestris Bonnaterre),2010,Jason P Hernandez,,,,,East Carolina University,In natural ecosystems. the order of species arrival can impact the development of the community.  In the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the Carolinas. wetland ponds exhibit a wide range of hydroperiods. ranging from ponds that dry up in late summer. to those that persist through fall and winter into spring.  Ponds that persist through the fall and winter can be colonized by late-summer breeding southern leopard frogs. whose tadpoles must remain in the ponds until the following spring.  Tadpoles of spring-breeding anurans. including Southern toads. are adversely affected by the presence of large tadpoles from the prior summer.  I examined several mechanisms potentially responsible for this effect: overwintering tadpoles changing the environment during the winter; large tadpoles outcompeting small hatchling tadpoles; interspecific differences in competitive ability between leopard frog and Southern toad; and density-dependent effects.  Leopard frog tadpoles had their primary adverse effect on Southern toads through processes occurring during the winter. prior to the arrival of Southern toads.  The other mechanisms tested were not significant.  The algal resource on which both species depend also showed a response to the presence of overwintered leopard frog tadpoles. being reduced where tadpoles had been present through winter and spring. and increased where overwintered tadpoles were present only in spring.  This response did not become apparent until late in the spring. suggesting that resource depletion per se is not the mechanism at work. but that some other process occurring in winter leads to adverse conditions for spring-hatched …,True,xCB_chsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,http://thescholarship.ecu.edu/handle/10342/2726,,,,https://thescholarship.ecu.edu/bitstream/handle/10342/2726/Hernandez_ecu_0600M_10118.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Hence. various fabrication approaches have been created on a variety of substrates to mimic or create cell specific cues. However. to achieve cell specific cues a multistep process or a post-chemical treatment is often necessitated. So. a simple approach without any chemical or biological treatment would go a long way in developing bio-functionalized substrates to effectively modulate cell adhesion and interaction. The present investigation is aimed to study the manipulative activity induced by phase transformed titanium surface. An ultra-short laser is used to fabricate the phase transformed titanium surface where a polymorphic titanium oxide phases with titanium monoxide (TiO). tri-titanium oxide (Ti3O) and titanium …,True,1P65g-MAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,5,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482715301440,8113298045158387205,/scholar?cites=8113298045158387205,,,0,0,0

It will provide a powerful tool for pathological prognosis. Currently. there exists no method of such prediction. Here. we introduce nickel-based functionalized nanoprobe facilitated surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for prediction of cancer dissemination by undertaking CSC-based surveillance. SERS profiling of CSCs of various cell lines (breast cancer. cervical cancer. and lung cancer) was compared with their cancer counterparts for the prediction of prognosis. with statistical significance of single-cell sensitivity. The single-cell sensitivity is critical as even a few CSCs are capable of initiating a tumor.

Many of these species maintain nonwhite winter morphs. locally adapted to less snowy conditions. which may have evolved independently. Mountain hares (Lepus timidus) from Fennoscandia were introduced into the Faroe Islands in 1855. While they were initially winter-white. within ∼65 y all Faroese hares became winter-gray. a morph that occurs in the source population at low frequency. The documented population history makes this a valuable model for understanding the genetic basis and evolution of the seasonal trait polymorphism. Through whole-genome scans of differentiation and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. we associated winter coat color polymorphism to the genomic region of the pigmentation gene Agouti. previously linked to …,True,IzvpjH4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,13,https://www.pnas.org/content/116/48/24150.short,7059894807776895774,/scholar?cites=7059894807776895774,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/48/24150.full.pdf,0,0,0

Although the population genetics and evolution of European Neolithic populations have been extensively studied. little is known regarding the Neolithic expansion in North Africa with respect to Europe. One could expect that the different environmental and geological conditions at both shores of the Mediterranean Sea could have led to contrasting expansions. In order to test this hypothesis. we compared the Neolithic expansion in Europe and North Africa accounting for possible migration between them through the Strait of Gibraltar. We analyzed the entire X chromosome of 580 individuals from 20 populations spatially distributed along the North of Africa and Europe. Next. we applied approximate Bayesian computation based on extensive spatially explicit computer simulations to …,True,IzvpjH4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,8,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/34/12/3232/4237582,13609301562720626444,/scholar?cites=13609301562720626444,,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/34/12/3232/4237582,0,0,0

In order to shed light on them. here we evaluated the gene flow and genetic structure throughout the Iberian Peninsula with spatially explicit modelling applied to a georeferenced genetic dataset composed of genome-wide SNPs from 746 individuals belonging to 17 different regions of the Peninsula. We found contrasting patterns of genetic structure throughout Iberia. In particular. we identified strong patterns of genetic differentiation caused by relevant barriers to gene flow in northern regions and. on the other hand. a large genetic similarity in central and southern regions.

Refractoriness can be diagnosed by laboratory tests and patients should receive compatible platelet transfusions. A fast. effective and low cost antibody-screening method which detects platelet human leukocyte/platelet antigen antibodies is essential in the management of immune platelet refractoriness.    OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the flow cytometry platelet immunofluorescence test to screen for immune platelet refractoriness.    METHODS: A group of prospective hematologic patients with clinically suspected platelet refractoriness treated in a referral center in Campinas. SP during July 2006 and July 2011 was enrolled in this study. Platelet antibodies were screened using the flow cytometry platelet immunofluorescence test. Anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies were detected by commercially available methods. The sensitivity. specificity and predictive values of the immunofluorescence test were determined taking into account that the majority of antiplatelet antibodies presented human leukocyte antigen specificity.    RESULTS: Seventy-six samples from 32 female and 38 male patients with a median age of 43.5 years (range: 5-84 years) were analyzed. The sensitivity of the test was 86.11% and specificity 75.00% with a positive predictive value of 75.61% and a negative predictive value of 85.71%. The accuracy of the method was 80.26%.

This paper develops methods for modeling the organization of such data. as well as their Euclidean counterparts. across spatial scales. Using the notion of diffusion distance. we introduce diffusion Fréchet functions and diffusion Fréchet vectors associated with probability distributions on Euclidean space and the vertex set of a weighted network. respectively. We prove that these functional statistics are stable with respect to the Wasserstein distance between probability measures. thus yielding robust descriptors of their shapes.

D. dissertation,,,The Florida State University,Climate is a key factor for the development and evolution of plants. Different families of plants have difersified during millions of years due to the effect of climate. Analysis of data related to climatic variables (such as temperature and precipitation) and taxonomic data can help solve different questions related to the evolutionary trayectories of plants. In this study. taxonomical and climatic data of two subfamilies of the Fabaceae plant family (Mimosoideae. Papilionoideae) are analyzed using multiscale Fréchet functions. The goal of this project is to create tools to study and understand the climatic’preferences’ of this family of plants and their relationship to their taxonomical classification using MFFs. This relationship is important to understand how climate affects the long-term evolution of plant communities. The MFFs will be helpful in identifying subcommunities of plants that share similar climatic environments.

Endangered and endemic Semnopithecus ajax (Himalayan Grey Langur) in the Chamba District of Himachal Pradesh. India. Field surveys and community interviews began in May. 2012. Of the 244 sites surveyed across the 5 of the 6 administrative blocks of Chamba District. langurs were found to be present in 124 sites as indicated by direct sighting and community interviews. The langurs face considerable antagonism due to crop raiding from the community as evident in 76 sites reporting conflict with langurs. The long standing taxonomic uncertainty distinguishing Semnopithecus ajax from the congeners Semnopithecus schistaceus and Semnopithecus hector was resolved with photographic morphological and observational data analyses. establishing that the langurs in Chamba are indeed Semnopithecus ajax as opposed to the langurs elsewhere in the Himalayan region. Other conservation threats such as agricultural expansion and deforestation were found. though not quantified due to lack of time and resource. Potential stakeholders have been identified and will be involved during the scaling up project.

This species was seen on a number of occasions either in groups or solitary (Table 1. Fig. 1) at altitudes ranging between 786 m asl to 2664 m asl. In the Chamba Block. two individuals were observed feeding on shrubs at Bamouth. three individuals were observed at Dainkund (Fig. 2a & b) in grassland habitat interspersed with dry shrubs. a solitary individual was observed at Khajjiar in mixed forest habitat and two individuals were observed at Sundla on hilly grassland. In the Mehla Block. two individuals were observed at Saun (Fig. 2c) in dense shrubbery. at Gajnoi a solitary individual was observed in cropland. at Chanadu a solitary individual was observed among rocks. at Pataru a group of three individuals were observed among shrubs and at Talai a group of three individuals were observed in a habitat of trees interspersed with shrubs (Table 1).The Yellow-throated Marten is primarily a forest dwelling species. It is facing threat due to conversion of forest lands and hunting. This species is hunted in some parts of northeast India. Southeast Asia. Lao PDR and northern parts of Russia for its meat and fur (Abramov et al. 2008; Selvan et al. 2013). However. despite these threats the populations of this species in areas where it is distributed is surviving well probably because it is not much preferred for its meat and also because of its scansorial habit due to which it can detect and escape traps laid by hunters and getting caught by their dogs (Abramov et al. 2008).

We introduce a new theory into the debate and test a UV radiation → intelligence → socioeconomic latent variable (SELV) model vis-à-vis a radiation → SELV → intelligence one. Only the latter is found well-adjusted in Italy. more so among adolescents than children. Since hair and eye color vary with latitude in Italy and UV radiation could be a proxy for ancestry. the models are retested among White students in the USA. Similar results observed suggest that. in both countries. increased UV radiation impairs socio-economic development. perhaps by reducing industriousness through oxidative stress. The ensuing less-developed social environments exert negative influences on individuals’ cognition. Yet. ancestry appears to add latitudinal socioeconomic variance in Italy. A third study in Brazil. in turn. shows that cognitive effects of UV radiation through SELV are clearly distinguishable from the cognitive effects of race.

Познание биологического разнообразия региональных флор одно из приоритетных направлений современной ботаники. научное значение которого с каждым годом возрастает. Под влиянием хозяйственной деятельности человека быстрыми темпами обедняется видовое и популяционное разнообразие флоры и растительности целых регионов. В этой связи важно выявить общее видовое разнообразие растений и изучить особенности распространения тех или иных видов в конкретных территориальных выделах. а также учесть степень устойчивости популяций в современных растительных сообществах и установить какие именно виды заслуживают охраны.Эти задачи помогают решить популяционноонтогенетические исследования. Они позволяют не только оценить состояние популяций в настоящее время. но и спрогнозировать их дальнейшую судьбу в случае разного рода антропогенных воздействий. дать обоснованные рекомендации по охране растительного мира (Вахрамеева. 1988; Вахрамеева. Куликова. 1991; Амирханов. Тишков. 2000; Налимова. 2003 и др.).

Вследствие изменений природной среды или антропогенных воздействий на протяжении третичного и особенно четвертичного периодов сплошные ареалы папоротников оказались разорванными на отдельные фрагменты.

Iran in June and October 2007. The fish were examined for infection with the nematode Rhabdochona fortunatowi (Dinnik. 1933). Nematodes were counted and sexed. then the sex ratio and intestinal site preference of the R. fortunatowi individuals and the intersexual interactions of the parasites were investigated. Significant differences were observed in the prevalence and intensity of infection in relation to host size and sampling season. but not host sex. Parasite burden (mean intensity) was higher in October than in June and the results revealed a decrease in female-to-male sex ratio (FMR) in the fish in October compared to the ones in June. In other words. as the mean intensity of infection of R. fortunatowi increases. the proportion of male worms increases. too. The female-biased sex ratio in June was replaced by a male-biased one in October. Nematode distribution rose to a significant peak in the mid-region of the fish intestine relative to the anterior and posterior parts. Some changes in the distribution of male and female worms in different parts of the host intestine were also observed during June and October. Density-dependent selection and intersexual competition seem to be the main factors driving such a shift in the sex ratio and its variation in different parts of the host intestine.,True,_PM1BdgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehdi_Golestaninasab/publication/49822418_Variation_in_the_sex_ratio_of_Rhabdochona_fortunatowi_Spirurida_Rhabdochonidae_in_Capoeta_capoeta_gracilis_Cypriniformes_Cyprinidae_relative_to_levels_of_infection_host_size_and_temperature/links/54df63e30cf2510fcee6fcea.pdf,2465617637722162262,/scholar?cites=2465617637722162262,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehdi_Golestaninasab/publication/49822418_Variation_in_the_sex_ratio_of_Rhabdochona_fortunatowi_Spirurida_Rhabdochonidae_in_Capoeta_capoeta_gracilis_Cypriniformes_Cyprinidae_relative_to_levels_of_infection_host_size_and_temperature/links/54df63e30cf2510fcee6fcea.pdf,0,0,0

Although molecular barcoding may be the fastest choice to determine the identity of a given species. robust and fast species level identification in the field using morphological characters is essential. During this study. 389 specimens representing seven stingray species (Brevitrygon walga. Himantura leoparda. H. uarnak. Maculabatis randalli. M. arabica. M. gerrardi and Pateobatis fai) were examined from the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. A 1044 bp fragment of the NADH2 gene was generated for 50 specimens with representatives of all species. To verify the initial morphological identification and to compare intra-and interspecific differences a Neighbor-Joining analysis was conducted using uncorrected p-distances. whereas the Bayesian Inference was used to examine the relationships among taxa. Two species (M. arabica and M. gerrardi) are documented from the Persian Gulf for the first time. The molecular results provide the first known evidence of the sympatric distribution of M. randalli and M. arabica in the north and northwestern Indian Ocean. The results of the Bayesian Inference support the recent divergence of both species. Based on morphological comparisons and molecular support we suggest that the descriptions of M. randalli and M. arabica have been carried out on heterogeneous type series which has led to inconsistency between molecular identification and diagnostic morphological characteristics.

For two decades. it has been hypothesized that transcription factors such as Distal-less (Dll) are responsible for eyespot pattern development in butterfly wings. based on their expression in the prospective eyespots. In particular. it has been suggested that Dll is a determinant for eyespot size. However. functional evidence for this hypothesis has remained incomplete. due to technical difficulties. Here. we show that ectopically expressed Dll induces ectopic elemental color patterns in the adult wings of the blue pansy butterfly. Junonia orithya (Lepidoptera. Nymphalidae). Using baculovirus-mediated gene transfer. we misexpressed Dll protein fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in pupal wings. resulting in ectopic color patterns. but not the formation of intact eyespots. Induced changes included clusters of black and orange scales (a basic feature of eyespot patterns). black and gray scales. and inhibition of cover scale development. In contrast. ectopic expression of GFP alone did not induce any color pattern changes using the same baculovirus-mediated gene transfer system. These results suggest that Dll plays an instructive role in the development of color pattern elements in butterfly wings. although Dll alone may not be sufficient to induce a complete eyespot. This study thus experimentally supports the hypothesis of Dll function in eyespot development.,True,3hmwXWoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,19,https://zoologicalletters.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40851-016-0040-9,5950979770280919695,/scholar?cites=5950979770280919695,,https://zoologicalletters.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40851-016-0040-9,0,0,0

This problem cannot be ignored when individual variation within a species is large. To circumvent this problem in the butterfly wing system. we developed a new surgical method for removing a single forewing from a pupa using Junonia orithya; the operated pupa was left to develop to an adult without eclosion. The removed right forewing was subjected to gene expression analysis. whereas the non-removed left forewing was examined for color patterns. As a test case. we focused on Distal-less (Dll). which likely plays an active role in inducing elemental patterns. including eyespots.

Population genetics theory has been developed and tested to explain the rapid evolution of sex chromosomes and sex determination. However. we do not know why the sex chromosomes are divergent in some taxa and conserved in others. Addressing this question requires comparing closely related taxa with conserved and divergent sex chromosomes to identify biological features that could explain these differences. Cytological karyotypes suggest that muscid flies (e.g.. house fly) and blow flies are such a taxonomic pair. The sex chromosomes appear to differ across muscid species. whereas they are conserved across blow flies. Despite the cytological evidence. we do not know the extent to which muscid sex chromosomes are independently derived along …,True,3hmwXWoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,3,https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-abstract/10/4/1341/6026224,12261082916516234851,/scholar?cites=12261082916516234851,,https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/10/4/1341/6026224,0,0,0
1081135,Thermal tolerance and preference are both consistent with the clinal distribution of house fly proto-Y chromosomes,2021,Pablo J Delclos and Kiran Adhikari and Jessica E Cambric and Anna G Matuk and Rebecca I Presley and Jessica Tran and Richard P Meisel,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Selection pressures can vary within localized areas and across massive geographical scales. Temperature is one of the best studied ecologically variable abiotic factors that can affect selection pressures across multiple spatial scales. Organisms rely on physiological (thermal tolerance) and behavioral (thermal preference) mechanisms to thermoregulate in response to environmental temperature. In addition. spatial heterogeneity in temperatures can select for local adaptation in thermal tolerance. thermal preference. or both. However. the concordance between thermal tolerance and preference across genotypes and sexes within species and across populations is greatly understudied. The house fly. Musca domestica. is a well-suited system to examine how genotype and environment interact to affect thermal tolerance and preference. Across multiple continents. house fly males from higher latitudes tend to carry the male-determining gene on the Y chromosome. whereas those from lower latitudes usually have the male-determiner on the third chromosome. We tested whether these two male-determining chromosomes differentially affect thermal tolerance and preference as predicted by their geographical distributions. We identify effects of genotype and developmental temperature on male thermal tolerance and preference that are concordant with the natural distributions of the chromosomes. suggesting that temperature variation across the species range contributes to the maintenance of the polymorphism. In contrast. female thermal preference is bimodal and largely independent of congener male genotypes.

Species with polygenic sex determination. in which master regulatory genes are found on multiple different proto-sex chromosomes. are informative models to study the evolution of sex determination. House flies are such a model system. with male determining loci possible on all six chromosomes and a female-determiner on one of the chromosomes as well. The distributions of the two most common male-determining proto-Y chromosomes across natural populations suggests that temperature variation is an important selection pressure responsible for maintaining polygenic sex determination in this species. To test that hypothesis. we used RNA-seq to identify temperature-dependent effects of the proto-Y chromosomes on gene expression. We find no evidence for ecologically meaningful temperature-dependent expression of sex determining genes between male genotypes. but we identified hundreds of other genes whose expression depends on the interaction between proto-Y chromosome genotype and temperature. Notably. genes with genotype-by-temperature interactions on expression are not enriched on the proto-sex chromosomes. Moreover. there is no evidence that temperature-dependent expression is driven by chromosome-wide expression divergence between the proto-Y and proto-X alleles. Therefore. if temperature-dependent gene expression is responsible for differences in phenotypes and fitness of proto-Y genotypes across house fly populations. these effects are driven by a small number of temperature …,True,3hmwXWoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.238378v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/08/05/2020.08.05.238378.full.pdf,0,0,0

To address this need. we investigated how bat microbiota compare to microbiota from the cave walls in two El Malpais National Monument caves. The external surfaces of six roosting bats from each cave. representing four different bat species. and their associated microbial mats were sampled. One to three air samples were taken in each cave. Samples were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene for bacterial diversity and the ITS region for fungal diversity. Many bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were shared among the sample types. Within the bacterial OTUs. Actinobactria were highest overall in all samples. but were higher in bats than mats. The most prevalent actinobacterial genera recovered were Rhodococcus. Streptomyces.

Conidia of Pseudogymnoascus species are often documented on bats prior to the onset of WNS. but characterization of high-risk areas defined by microclimate cave conditions have been lacking. Investigating the occurrence of this fungal genus and appropriate environmental conditions to support P. destructans in southwestern US caves is key to understanding the sites most likely to be impacted by WNS. Microclimate conditions in ten caves at El Malpais (ELMA) National Monument in New Mexico. USA were recorded using i-Button data loggers during the winters of 2011–2014 to assess appropriate environmental conditions (temperature and relative humidity) for P. destructans and other Pseudogymnoascus species. Optimal microclimate conditions for P. destructans and other psychrophilic fungi were found in all the caves with at least 50% of the caves identified as high-risk areas. Pseudogymnoascus species were detected in 70% of the caves using culturing methods and PCR. but no soil samples were positive for P. destructans using real-time PCR in soil and guano samples. Pseudogymnoascus destructans has a recognized range of appropriate temperatures and relative humidity for growth and cave microclimate can help define high-risk areas. This study offers resource managers guidance for establishing priority monitoring areas in their bat caves to determine which bat species are at higher risk.,True,RkoiHLYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/ijs/vol48/iss2/7/,,,,https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2254&context=ijs,0,0,0

Kostelec nad Černými Lesy, Czech Republic. Internet: https://dx. doi. org/10.13140/RG",12394.62405,,,Chironomidae (non-biting midges) is the largest group of aquatic insects and one of the most diverse families of dipterans. with nearly 7500 described species and 550 genera (Pape et al. 2011). Cladotanytarsus Kieffer. 1921. with 78 known species is a large chironomid genus of the tribe Tanytarsini. All life stages of Cladotanytarsus are important elements of trophic chains; immatures may be used as bioindicators due to diverse range of tolerance or preference for habitat conditions; phytophagous larvae of some Cladotanytarsus are pests. while mass presence of other species may cause allergic symptoms and diseases of the respiratory system (Cranston et al. 1981. Darby 1962. Giłka 2011. Puchalski et al. 2016). Recent concepts of the systematic division of Cladotanytarsus indicated two subgenera: Cladotanytarsus s. str. and Lenziella-redefined on the basis of morphological characters of adults and pupa (Giłka 2011). Research on species richness show significant disproportions within the two subgenera: 71 species of Cladotanytarsus s. str. and only 7 Lenziella (Puchalski & Giłka 2017a. b).

B,1847,20162406,The Royal Society,In social bees. foraging behaviour is correlated with reproductive status and sucrose sensitivity via endocrine pathways. This association led to the hypothesis that division of labour in social insect societies is derived from an ancestral ground plan that functions to synchronize dietary preferences with reproductive needs in solitary insects. However. the relationship between these traits is unknown for solitary bees. which represent the ancestral state of social bees. We used the proboscis extension response assay to measure sucrose response among reproductive females of the solitary alkali bee (Nomia melanderi) as a function of acute juvenile hormone (JH) treatments and reproductive physiology.

1081186,Tracing Brain Structures of Alkali Bees to Investigate Endocrine and Social Effects on Neural Plasticity,2017,Justin Tirrell and Mallory A Hagadorn and Makenna M Johnson and Karen M Kapheim,,,,,,For highly social bee species. juvenile hormone (JH) and social cues are linked to increased expression of class-based social features. However. little data has been collected on the relationship between these variables and homologous features in non-social bees. To fill this gap in data. we studied the neuroanatomical response of Nomia melanderi. a non-social bee species. to endocrine and social treatments. Since N. melanderi is a non-social bee with pre-adaptations to sociality. such as brood care and aggregative nesting habits. its responses to hormone treatment and social cues can be used to model how neural plasticity in non-social ancestors of highly social bee species may have played a role in social evolution. Specifically. we measured volumetric difference in mushroom body structures. which are known to function in social cognition in social bees. in response to our treatments. Brains from the six treatment groups were dissected and imaged using confocal microscopy techniques. By scaling the actual distance in an image to its pixel density. reliable measurements of volume are produced from evenly spaced cross-sections of N. melanderi brain. Since data collection for the current phase of the project is still underway. it’s premature to make any conclusion about how JH and social cues influence neural plasticity in N. melanderi. However. the results of our experiment are likely to provide unique insights into the evolution of sociality in bee species generally. 1,True,hMBg7ZUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/biology_posters/194/,,,,https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1208&context=biology_posters,0,0,0

My first data chapter was an extensive field study that examined how two salmon and two small pelagic fish integrate with key prey across the estuary of the Skeena River. The different fishes selected different prey that were unevenly distributed across the estuary seascape in time and space; however. some prey were associated with biophysical factors like salinity and eelgrass. My next chapter compiled empirical published data on five species of juvenile salmon growth rates and residency durations.

In the southeast United Sates. turtle nests are threatened by numerous anthropogenic and natural threats. including predation of eggs by native and non-native predators. We analyzed loggerhead nest predation and other egg; loss using an exceptional 10-year data set (2009–2018) that covered nesting beaches on 12 islands on the Georgia coast. Our objectives were to 1) determine which predators cause the greatest loss of loggerhead sea turtle eggs. 2) evaluate whether non-native species have a higher; rate of predation than native species. and 3) compare predation rates to other major sources of egg loss across these islands. Our results show that under current strategies for nest management: 1) non-native feral hogs and native raccoons have the …,True,qK809-kAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989420306806,2786616995652303703,/scholar?cites=2786616995652303703,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989420306806,0,0,0

Moreover. efforts to manage beaches for sea turtle nesting can be undermined by predation of eggs and hatchlings by native and introduced species. Therefore. minimizing nest depredation has been identified as a key objective of recovery plans for the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) and other species (NMFS-USFWS 2008). In the Northwest Atlantic loggerhead population. common nest predators include armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). coyotes (Canis latrans). feral hogs (Sus scrofa). fire ants (Solenopsis spp.). foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus and Vulpes vulpes). ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata). and raccoons (Procyon lotor)(Dodd 1988; Drennen et al. 1989; NMFS-USFWS 2008). The impacts of mammalian predators. in particular. are well-documented and can be quite severe. prompting longstanding predator control and nest protection programs (Engeman et al. 2006; NMFS-USFWS 2008). In contrast. the threat of loggerhead nest depredation by ants has received less attention (but see sources reviewed below). and more research on its prevalence. potential risk factors. and associated losses is needed to devise and implement appropriate management plans.Several predatory ant species. including the native tropical fire ant. Solenopsis geminata. and a thief ant.

Without this information. efforts to contextualize changes in breeding populations and develop effective management strategies are compromised. We used stable isotope analysis of tissue samples collected from loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting at seven sites in the Northern Recovery Unit (NRU) of the eastern United States (North Carolina. South Carolina and Georgia) to assign females to three separate foraging areas in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA). We found that the majority of the females at NRU nesting sites (84.4%) use more northern foraging areas in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. while fewer females use more proximate foraging areas in the South Atlantic Bight (13.4%) and more southerly foraging areas in the Subtropical Northwest Atlantic (2.2%). We did not find significant latitudinal or temporal trends in the proportions of NRU females originating from different foraging areas. Combining these findings with previous data from stable isotope and satellite tracking studies across NWA nesting sites showed that variation in the proportion of adult loggerheads originating from different foraging areas is primarily related differences between recovery units: individuals in the NRU primarily use the Mid-Atlantic Bight foraging area. while individuals from the three Florida recovery units primarily use the Subtropical Northwest Atlantic and Eastern Gulf of Mexico foraging areas.

1081227,The expression of melanopsin and clock genes in Xenopus laevis melanophores and their modulation by melatonin,2012,APC Bluhm and NN Obeid and AML Castrucci and MA Visconti,45,Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research,8,730-736,Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research,Vertebrates have a central clock and also several peripheral clocks. Light responses might result from the integration of light signals by these clocks. The dermal melanophores of Xenopus laevis have a photoreceptor molecule denominated melanopsin (OPN4x). The mechanisms of the circadian clock involve positive and negative feedback. We hypothesize that these dermal melanophores also present peripheral clock characteristics. Using quantitative PCR. we analyzed the pattern of temporal expression of Opn4x and the clock genes Per1. Per2. Bmal1. and Clock in these cells. subjected to a 14-h light:10-h dark (14L:10D) regime or constant darkness (DD). Also. in view of the physiological role of melatonin in the dermal melanophores of X. laevis. we determined whether melatonin modulates the expression of these clock genes. These genes show a time-dependent expression pattern when these cells are exposed to 14L:10D. which differs from the pattern observed under DD. Cells kept in DD for 5 days exhibited overall increased mRNA expression for Opn4x and Clock. and a lower expression for Per1. Per2. and Bmal1. When the cells were kept in DD for 5 days and treated with melatonin for 1 h. 24 h before extraction. the mRNA levels tended to decrease for Opn4x and Clock. did not change for Bmal1. and increased for Per1 and Per2 at different Zeitgeber times (ZT).

Moreover. individual Rab proteins function at specific sites within the cell. for example the ER. golgi and early endosome. Importantly. the localization and function of individual Rab subfamily members are often conserved underscoring the significant contributions that model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans can make towards a better understanding of human disease caused by Rab and vesicle trafficking malfunction. With this in mind. a bioinformatics approach was first taken to identify and classify the complete C. elegans Rab family placing individual Rabs into specific subfamilies based on molecular phylogenetics. For genes that were difficult to classify by sequence similarity alone. we did a comparative analysis of intron position among specific subfamilies from yeast to humans.

We combined population-genomic analyses of evolve-and-resequence experiments. genome-wide association mapping of performance traits. and analyses of gene expression to fill this knowledge gap and shed light on the genomics of adaptation to a marginal host (lentil) by the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. Using population-genomic approaches. we detected modest parallelism in allele frequency change across replicate lines during adaptation to lentil. Mapping populations derived from each lentil-adapted line revealed a polygenic basis for two host-specific performance traits (weight and development time). which had low to modest heritabilities. We found less evidence of parallelism in genotype-phenotype associations across these lines than in allele frequency changes during the experiments. Differential gene expression caused by differences in recent evolutionary history exceeded that caused by immediate rearing host. Together. the three genomic datasets suggest that genes affecting traits other than weight and development time are likely to be the main causes of parallel evolution and that detoxification genes (especially cytochrome P450s and beta-glucosidase) could be especially important for colonization of lentil by C. maculatus.

Theory predicts that adaptation should occur more rapidly when standing variation exists. but this has rarely been tested. For example. experimental evolution studies rarely consider both de novo mutation and standing variation because the generation time for sexually reproductive organisms is often too long for de novo mutations to contribute. while experiments with quickly reproducing asexual organisms typically start with genetically homogeneous clines. Here we test the hypothesis that standing variation facilitates adaptation to high temperatures in fission yeast (S. pombe)(Fig. 1). To this end. survival data were generated and analyzed from genetically homogeneous and variable colonies of S. pombe. a sexually reproducing yeast. under the stressful growth condition …,True,QazeOAgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=biology_posters,,,,https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=biology_posters,0,0,0

Through the video tracker tool. the analysis of speed and rotation acceleration becomes easier. The rotating object used as a research object is a spinner fidget. The initial velocity of the rotation depends on the pull of the finger on the spinner. The duration of rotating spinner fidget depends on the inertia and attenuation that occurs.

1081258,On precipitation of struvite (MgNH4PO4.6H2O),2017,Stefanus Muryanto,1,Journal of Science and Science Education,2,21-29,FSM UKSW,Excessive input of N and P into water bodies causes eutrophication which leads to deterioration of aquatic evironments and has adverse effects naturally and economically. It is therefore urgent to remove N and P from wastewater prior to disposal into inland and coastal waters. Among the various removal methods. controlled struvite precipitation is preferred. Struvite (MgNH4PO4. 6H2O) precipitates uncontrollably under the specific conditions producing a scale deposit causing persistent problems in industries and wastewater treatment plants. The scale deposit clogs the piping system and impair plant equipment. On the other hand. thanks to its composition and properties. struvite is a potential fertilizer. In medical field. struvite is a common component of kidney stones. A number of process parameters govern the struvite precipitation. This paper briefly presents these parameters: pH. molar ratios. temperature. mixing. and presence of foreign ions. pH level is considered as the most important variable affecting the precipitation of struvite and the pH level: 9.5 to 10.5 is seen as the optimum. For an effective precipitation the molar ratios of the struvite components. ie Mg: N: P should be at least unity. With regard to struvite solubility. the effect of temperature. in the range of 21oC to 49oC. is conflicting. which is probably due to different experimental conditions. Whilst agitation is not regarded as a decisive parameter. the influence of foreign ions. notably divalent metal ions. on struvite morphology and change of crystal phases is significant.,True,z9AIFZwAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,5,https://ejournal.uksw.edu/josse/article/view/1459,7855295392737123971,/scholar?cites=7855295392737123971,,https://ejournal.uksw.edu/josse/article/download/1459/803,0,0,0
1081259,A simple parameterization for tsunami run-up prediction,2017,Latifatul Cholifah and Tjipto Prastowo,1,Journal of Science and Science Education,2,7-13,FSM UKSW,The linear shallow-water approximation is commonly used to describe tsunami propagation. where the wave is assumed as a long surface gravity wave. The evolution of wave height during its propagation from offshore to onshore is a classic problem. When arriving at a shoreline. the increased wave height causes severe destruction on infrastructures and fatalities. This problem has then been an important issue within the context of disaster risk reduction as it gives rise to the importance of tsunami run-up prediction. Using maximum run-up data from past events. we tested the applicability of the Green’s law based on shoaling only to calculate run-ups and found that the basic Green’s law was in doubt. Then. we examined energy density conservation involving refraction effect but no dissipation and derived a simple formula for parameterizing run-up height. Detailed descriptions on factors affecting run-ups. such as complex bathymetry and topography are not yet considered in the current study. The aim of this study is therefore to determine whether the modified Green’s law is applicable for tsunami run-up prediction using local water depths as external parameters and ray spacing widths in the normal direction of wave fronts related to refraction. The results are consistent with the measured run-ups. where approximately 70% of total points of observations confirm the modified Green’s law with a reasonable accuracy.,True,z9AIFZwAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC,5,https://ejournal.uksw.edu/josse/article/view/1456,2649615798470733325,/scholar?cites=2649615798470733325,,https://ejournal.uksw.edu/josse/article/download/1456/801,0,0,0

Mostly teachers provide evaluation in low cognitive level so students are able to achieve the minimum passing grade. Whereas a good evaluation should use Bloom’s Taxonomy as a basis for classifying student’s cognitive level. It leads teacher to provide a learning that facilitates student’s achievement of high cognitive level. including using independent lab work module. Teachers also typically provide a global report evaluation. ie providing the final score only. without presenting the distribution of students’ cognitive level. For this purpose. Venn Diagram is used to show the distribution of students’ cognitive level based on Bloom Taxonomy. This research aimed to present the distribution of students’ Bloom cognitive level using Venn Diagram and to investigate whether the development of independent lab work module about light refraction using PhET simulation “Bending Light “can make students achieve the cognitive levels of knowing. understanding. applying. and analyzing.

Secondary data were collected from Webdc3. comprising earthquake magnitudes in the regions of interest during 2008-2015 measured in MW. The study focuses on earthquake size estimates for local events as a parameter through simple evaluation of a linear equation relating Td to MW. For all the events considered. empirical formulas derived from the random data for estimating the size are. respectively. Mpd=(Td+ 6.6799)/1.5199 for West Sulawesi and Mpd=(Td+ 3.3648)/0.8464 for Central Sulawesi. Each was used to recalculate events in the two regions. The results were compared to the reference provided by the Global CMT catalog. The results are consistent with the reference having a standard deviation of up to 0.2. showing evidence of no significant difference in magnitude determination between the method proposed in the current study and that of the Global CMT.

The student's analytical skills can be enhanced by theoretical learning methods. However. theoretical learning method will not be optimal in improving the visual ability. Another method is required that can encourage students' analytical and visual abilities. The learning method that suits these needs is a case study. The case study method in geometry lessons can be applied by creating scenarios that are divided into two stages: the preparation stage and the implementation stage. The preparation stage is related to the formulation of scenarios of case studies that will be conducted by the students in the field. while in the implementation stage the students conduct direct observation in the field based on the case study scenario at the preparation stage and then present the observation result through the presentation. accompanied by suggestion and evaluation from teachers.,True,z9AIFZwAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC,1,https://ejournal.uksw.edu/josse/article/view/1917,15235323912021474974,/scholar?cites=15235323912021474974,,https://ejournal.uksw.edu/josse/article/download/1917/954,0,0,0

The aim of our study was to isolate and identify bacteria from samples of breast-milk of 32 women and from fecal samples of their breast-fed infants. Antimicrobial activity of isolates was also performed. A total of 155 isolates were characterized by phenotypic tests and identified by 16S rDNA sequencing analysis. The isolates belonged to 6 different species of acid lactic bacteria (LAB) and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Enterococcus faecium was the most frequently isolated species (40.8%) and faeces (42.5%). According to the mother’s lifestyle. we noticed that the genus Enterococcus was the most frequently isolated from rural mother’s milk as well as urban mother’s milk. Lactobacillus fermentum (P< 0.05) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (P< 0.01) were isolated only from rural mother’s milk. An antimicrobial activity was observed in 30 strains from 148 LAB. the higher level of antagonist was with E. faecium (35 mm). The observed results showed that the isolated strains from rural mother’s milk were different from that urban mother’s milk.

Ectotherms can alter membrane lipid composition in response to changes in environmental temperature. but it is currently unknown whether chronic hypoxia can also elicit membrane restructuring. The goal of this study was to investigate a possible physiological link between membrane remodelling and metabolic suppression in goldfish exposed to prolonged hypoxia (4 weeks at 10% air saturation). We have tested the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia would modulate membrane lipid composition in ways that are consistent with known mechanisms of ion pump inhibition. Because homeoviscous membrane restructuring could interfere with the response to hypoxia. measurements were made at 2 temperatures.

Continuous infusion of 2-[3H]glycerol was used to measure the rate of appearance of glycerol or lipolytic rate (Ra glycerol) in rainbow trout kept at rest. or during graded exercise in a swim tunnel up to critical swimming speed (Ucrit). Results show that Ra glycerol is 1.67±0.18 µmol kg−1 min−1 in control animals. and remains at a steady level of 1.24±0.10 µmol kg−1 min−1 in exercising fish at all swimming intensities. Baseline lipolytic rate provides more than enough fatty acids from lipid reserves to accommodate all the oxidative fuel requirements for swimming at up to 2 body lengths per second (BL s−1). and more than 50% of the energy needed at Ucrit (3.4±0.1 BL s−1).

1081322,Lipid Mobilization In Exercising Salmonids,2018,Eric D Turenne,,,,,,Animals rely on lipids as a major fuel for endurance exercise because they pack more joules per gram than any other fuel. However. in contrast to mammals. information on how the mobilization of lipids from endogenous stores is managed to meet the needs of energy metabolism in swimming fish is sparse. Information on in vivo rates of lipid mobilization in swimming fish has been limited to relatively low exercise intensities and has only been investigated in a single species. Therefore. the goal of my thesis was to address this paucity of information by quantifying lipolytic rate in rainbow trout during graded exercise and fatty acid mobilization in Atlantic salmon during prolonged endurance exercise.  In the first part of my work. I hypothesized that like mammals. rainbow trout stimulate lipolysis above resting levels to a peak with increasing work intensity. but subsequently lower its rate at high intensities when ATP production from carbohydrates becomes dominant. To test this hypothesis. I measured the rate of appearance of glycerol (Ra glycerol) in the blood (resulting from the breakdown of triacylglycerol (TAG)) of trout at rest (control) and during graded exercise from rest to Ucrit. Results showed that Ra glycerol in trout averaged 1.24 ± 0.10 µmol kg -1 min-1 and that this rate was unaffected by exercise of any intensity. These experiments revealed that rainbow trout do not modulate lipolysis during exercise. Furthermore. I calculated that baseline lipolytic rate was much higher in trout than in mammals and that this rate is in constant excess of the requirements of energy metabolism. My second investigation focused on measuring fatty acid mobilization …,True,VlXMx7QAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://ruor.uottawa.ca/handle/10393/37075,,,,https://ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/37075/3/Turenne_Eric_D_2017_thesis.pdf,0,0,0

Systemic Candida albicans infections results in 30–50% mortality rates. Typically. adhesion to abiotic medical devices and implants initiates such infections. Efficient adhesion initiates formation of aggressive biofilms that are difficult to treat. Therefore. inhibitors of adhesion are important for drug development and likely to have a broad spectrum efficacy against many fungal pathogens. In this study we further the development of a small molecule. Filastatin. capable of preventing C. albicans adhesion. We explored the potential of Filastatin as a pre-therapeutic coating of a diverse range of biomaterials.

Unlike better-studied models. mycobacteria express ∼14% of their genes as leaderless transcripts. However. the impacts of leaderless transcript structures on mRNA half-life and translation efficiency in mycobacteria have not been directly tested. For leadered transcripts. the contributions of 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) to mRNA half-life and translation efficiency are similarly unknown. In M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. the essential sigma factor. SigA. is encoded by a transcript with a relatively short half-life.

Under conditions that cause growth to slow or stop. bacteria typically stabilize their transcriptomes in what has been shown to be a conserved stress response. In recent years. diverse studies have elucidated many of the mechanisms underlying mRNA degradation. yet an understanding of the regulation of mRNA degradation under stress conditions remains elusive. In this review we discuss the diverse mechanisms that have been shown to affect mRNA stability in bacteria.

In these low-metabolic states. Mtb can tolerate antibiotics and develop genetically encoded antibiotic resistance. making its metabolic adaptation to stress crucial for survival. Numerous bacteria. including Mtb. have been shown to reduce their rates of mRNA degradation under growth limitation and stress. While the existence of this response appears to be conserved across species. the underlying bacterial mRNA stabilization mechanisms remains unknown. To better understand the biology of non-growing mycobacteria. we sought to identify the mechanisms by which mRNA stabilization occurs using the non-pathogenic model Mycobacterium smegmatis. We found that mRNA half-life was responsive to energy stress. with carbon starvation and hypoxia causing global mRNA stabilization. This global mRNA stabilization was rapidly reversed when hypoxia-adapted cultures were re-exposed to oxygen. even in the absence of new transcription. The stringent response and RNase protein levels did not explain mRNA stabilization. nor did transcript abundance. This led us to hypothesize that metabolic changes during growth cessation impact the activity of degradation proteins. increasing mRNA stability. Indeed. bedaquiline and isoniazid. two drugs with opposing effects on cellular energy status. had opposite effects on mRNA half-lives in growth-arrested cells.

Several main signaling pathways have roles in regulating them including Wnt/β-catenin. and Hedgehog which mediate different stem cell properties including self-renewal. survival. proliferation. and differentiation. Also. molecular structures such as microRNAs act as tumor inhibitors or oncogenes and will change the direction of the messenger. The purpose of this review is to find and introduce different signaling pathways involved in controlling cancer stem cells with cancer treatment goals. The search was conducted using several databases including Google Scholar. PubMed. Scopus. Science Direct and totally 93 papers were selected. It seems that very important signaling pathways have been disturbed in cancers and excessive or abnormal signaling through these pathways can contribute to the survival of stem cells. Many of these pathways are not direct. but as an interconnected network of signaling could feed each other.

Retracted Sertoli cells (Sc). fibroid myoid cells and pre-meiotic resting spermatogonia are observed in such testis. This situation is akin to certain forms of infertility in men where hormone supplementation fails to generate sperm despite the presence of Sc and germ cells (Gc) in testis. In testis of lizard. spermatogenesis is reinitiated upon increased level of hormones during appropriate season (phase of recrudescence). Study of genes associated with generation of sperm. from regressed adult testis in lizard. may provide valuable information for understanding certain forms of male idiopathic infertility. Subtractive hybridization using testicular RNA obtained from the regressed and active phases of lizard reproductive cycle led to identify eight partial mRNA sequences that showed sequence homology with mice genes. We further evaluated the gene expression prolife by real-time PCR in three different reproductive phases of H. flaviviridis: regressed (pre-meiotic). recrudescent (meiotic) and active (post meiotic). for comparison with the corresponding testicular phases found in testis of 5 days (pre-meiotic). 20 days (meiotic) and 60 days (post-meiotic) old mouse.

1081360,Hormone responsiveness of cultured Sertoli cells obtained from adult rats after their rapid isolation under less harsh conditions,2016,M Gautam and I Bhattacharya and YS Devi and SP Arya and SS Majumdar,4,Andrology,3,509-519,,During adulthood. testicular Sertoli cells (Sc) coordinate all stages of germ cell (Gc) development involved in sperm production. However. our understanding about the functions of adult Sc is limited because of the difficulties involved in the process of isolating these cells from the adult testis. mainly because of the presence of large number of advanced Gc which interfere with Sc isolation at this age. Most of our knowledge about Sc function are derived from studies which used pre‐pubertal rat Sc (18 ± 2‐day old) as it is easy to isolate and culture Sc at this age. To this end. we established a less time consuming and less harsh procedure of isolating Sc from adult (60 days of age) rat testis for facilitating research on Sc‐mediated regulation of spermatogenesis during adulthood. The cells were isolated using collagenase digestion at higher temperature. reducing the exposure time of cells to the enzyme.

Even innately or stimulated. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2) secreted by ADSC were modulated and led to different inflammatory mechanism pathways through different inflammatory factors secretion. These properties can be very useful in the treatment of inflammation-associated chronic diseases. To be used. ex-vivo ADSC expansion is a critical issue prior to transplantation or cryopreservation. Functional cell changes have been reported during culture expansion being susceptible to interact with freezing/thawing effects leading to doubt on cell therapeutic outcomes. The aim of this study is to identify the effect of freezing/thawing at the different time point of expansion culture on IL-6 and TLR2 secretion.Methods: ADSC were collected from young female donors. expanded in culture and cryopreserved in Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) after each passage for 6 months to a year.

While one would ideally sample all diverse sites with appropriate habitat. there is usually a practical bias against visiting relatively inaccessible sites. For wild potato in the USA. mountain habitats often include easy access locations (near roads. usually at lower altitudes). and relatively remote locations (usually high altitude crests that can be accessed only by trail hiking and camping).

Plants were grown in controlled environment growth chamber and watered with balanced nutrient solution containing either 1 or 10 mM calcium.The plants overexpressing sCAX1 showed calcium deficiency symptoms while sequestering calcium in the vacuole as calcium oxalate crystals. Various fractions of calcium were quatified in the youg and mature leaves as well as tuber tissue. A reduced concentration of water soluble fraction of calcium was most important factor related to the development of calcium deficiency symptoms in the line overexpressing sCAX1. Furthermore. an increase in this fraction appear to explain the alleviation of the deficiency symptoms in these transgenic plants.Ours is the first study to document the significance of water-soluble calcium in the development of calcium-deficiency symptoms in the potato transgenic lines overexpressing sCAX1.

Most prominent are surface alterations. metabolic activation. cytoskeletal reorganization. and cell‐cycle reentry. While the activation process appears to be broadly evolutionarily conserved. and protein phosphorylation is known to play a key role. the signaling networks mediating the response to fertilization are not well described. To address this gap. we performed a time course phosphoproteomic analysis of egg activation in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. a system that offers biochemical tractability coupled with exquisite synchronicity. By coupling large‐scale phosphopeptide enrichment with unbiased quantitative MS. we identified striking changes in global phosphoprotein patterns at 2‐ and 5‐min postfertilization as compared to unfertilized eggs.

Mobility is handled by a joint ATM‐layer handoff for connection rerouting and MAC‐layer handoff for location tracking. such that the effects of mobility are localized and transparent to the higher‐layer protocols. Different functions. such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). mobile location. and ATM connection admission are combined to reduce protocol overhead and front‐end delay for connectionless packet transmission in connection‐oriented ATM networks. The proposed WVLAN. through the use of ATM technology. provides a scalable wireless virtual LAN solution for IP mobile hosts.,True,KaWNypkAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1019185017818,16530471559319263537,/scholar?cites=16530471559319263537,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/236387.236444,0,0,0

When wheat grown at 34℃ for 10 days. its chlorophyll content was 6 times less than that under the normal condition (22℃). The ribosomes were isolated from the leaves by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. It is found that only 80 S ribosomes existed in wheat leaves grown at the high temperature and the formation of 70 S ribosomes is specifically prevented. Since the absence of 70 S ribosomes in chloroplast. proteins synthesis can no longer proceed.

Severe poverty is the root cause of this undesirable situation as it leads to malnutrition. inadequate sanitation and consumption of unclean food and drink. This. compounded by lack of education and access to primary healthcare. results in infections by microorganisms such as viruses. bacteria. fungi and protozoa (Table 4.1). The most vulnerable to infectious diseases caused by microbial agents are children under the age of five. where 66% of deaths in this age group are a result of such diseases; 34% of all deaths are attributed to infectious diseases. This was underscored by WHO’s (World Health Organization’s) Regional Director for Africa. Luis Gomes Sambo. in 2011 when he said 63% of deaths on the continent were caused by microbial infections. with HIV/AIDS accounting for 38.5% of these (Anon. 2012). Thus. the most vulnerable groups are young children and individuals whose immune systems are compromised by HIV infection (Table 4.2). Community-acquired bacteraemia is a major cause of death in children at rural sub-Saharan district hospitals. A study by Berkley et al.(2005) showed that 12.8% of infants younger than 60 days had bacteraemia. Escherichia coli and group b streptococcus were the predominant infectious agents.

In Namibia. malaria claimed over 100 lives in 2011 alone (WHO. 2012). However. Namibia achieved a remarkable reduction in the number of cases between 2000 and 2011 (WHO. 2012). The number of confirmed (out-and in-patient) cases decreased from 477.786 in 2000 to 133.464 in 2008 (MoHSS. 2010). and further to 3.163 cases in 2012. Moreover. malaria deaths have dropped tremendously from 679 in 2000 to 199 in 2008 (MoHSS. 2010). and further to 45 in 2011 and four in 2012. This success story implies that Namibia is heading towards the elimination of malaria. with less than one case per 1.000 people per year (WHO. 2010). However. in 2013 a rise in the number of malaria cases was reported (4.745 cases). as well as in the number of reported deaths (21)(MoHSS. 2014).Although the incidence of malaria has decreased in Namibia in recent years. many people are at risk of contracting the disease. Malaria often requires hospitalization for extended periods of time and can lead to the loss of life. Furthermore. it has been found that uncomplicated and severe malaria negatively affects cognition and behaviour of sufferers. and impairs school performance in children (Fernando. Rodrigo. & Rajapakse. 2010). Pregnant women who contract malaria tend to give birth to infants with a low birth weight. which leads to high infant mortality (Breman. 2001).

It was hypothesized that. given soils from the same geographic region but under distinct urine conditions. the identity and counts of the pathogenic and actinobacteria communities would vary. For the purpose of this study. pathogenic microorganisms were limited to those known to cause infections of the urinary tract. Soil samples from 4 contaminated locations (Ara-Dorado. Hakahana.

Burkholderia species are versatile organisms that solubilize insoluble minerals through the production of organic acids. which increase the availability of nutrients for the plant. Therefore these bacteria are promising candidates for biotechnological applications. Burkholderia sp. (R 3.25 isolate) was isolated from agricultural soil in Ponta Grossa-PR-Brazil and identified through analysis of the 16S rDNA as a strain classified as Burkholderia gladioli. The expression of membrane-bound acid phosphatase (MBAcP) was strictly regulated with optimal expression at a concentration of phosphorus 5 mM. The apparent optimum pH for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphate (PNPP) was 6.0. The hydrolysis of PNPP by the enzyme exhibited a hyperbolic relationship with increasing concentration of substrate and no inhibition by excess of substrate was observed. Kinetic data revealed that the hydrolysis of PNPP exhibited cooperative kinetics with n = 1.3. Vm = 113.5 U/mg and K0.5 = 65 μM. The PNPPase activity was inhibited by vanadate. p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. arsenate and phosphate. however the activity was not inhibited by calcium. levamisole. sodium tartrate.

A previous study showed that disruption of the ORF XAC1201 from the Xac 306 strain by transposon Tn5 decreased bacterium virulence in the Rangpur lime host (Citrus limonia L. Osbeck). However. little is known regarding the possible function of the hypothetical protein XAC1201 and how it affects the virulence of Xac 306. Here. we confirmed that disruption of ORF XAC1201 reduces Xac 306 virulence in two different hosts. delaying the onset of typical symptoms. In silico analysis suggested that XAC1201 interacts with the flagellar proteins FliM and FliL. known to be an important factor for virulence. In fact. motility assays revealed that the XAC1201 mutant has a significant difference in motility compared to the wild-type Xac 306. Also. a 3-D structure model revealed modified cofactor binding sites and suggested that XAC1201 has a non-functional HD domain. This hypothesis was confirmed by enzymatic assays performed in purified. XAC1201 recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli. which revealed no significant activities previously associated with HD domains for the tested substrates. Thus. the role of the XAC1201 protein in Xac 306 virulence seems to be related to flagellar motility. although a non-classic role for the HD domain cannot be dismissed.,True,zHdnHdoAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,2,https://www.geneticsmr.org/articles/a-xanthomonas-citri-subsp-citri-hypothetical-protein-related-to-virulence-contains-a-nonfunctional-hd-domain-and-is-implicated-in--7395.html,12525606022016958574,/scholar?cites=12525606022016958574,,https://www.geneticsmr.org/articles/a-xanthomonas-citri-subsp-citri-hypothetical-protein-related-to-virulence-contains-a-nonfunctional-hd-domain-and-is-implicated-in--7395.html,0,0,0

Insects associated with pollination of C. arabica are one of the key factors for successful cultivation of C. arabica. but. the research regarding of these was still limited. The population of coffee plant is scattered across the highlands of Indonesia and the pollination of C. arabica is strongly believed linked to a diverse group of pollinating insects. However. lack of taxonomic identification of insects pollinating these plants has become one of constraints to succeed the cultivation of C. Arabica. This study aimed to analyze types and variations of pollinating insects of C. arabica in the province of North Sumatra. Indonesia. using DNA barcoding.

Insect pollinators are important keys to success of the agroecosystem. Converting natural landscapes to agricultural land. such as oil palm and rubber plantations. affects the insects. The research aims to study diversity and abundance of insect pollinators in three different agricultural land uses. ie oil palm plantation. rubber plantation. and jungle-rubber. Scan sampling method was used to explore the diversity of insect pollinators. Observations of the insects were conducted from 08.00 to 10.00 AM and 02.00 to 04.00 PM in sunny days. There were 497 individuals of insect pollinators collected. which belong to 43 species in three orders (Hymenoptera. Diptera. and Lepidoptera). Number of species and individual of insect pollinators found in rubber plantations (31 species. 212 individuals) and oil palm plantation (23 species. 188 individuals) were higher than that in jungle rubber (7 species. 97 individuals). Insect pollinators in oil palm plantations were dominated by giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) and stingless bee (Trigona sp.[¼aff. T. planifrons]). whereas in rubber plantation. they were dominated by small carpenter bees (Ceratina lieftincki and Ceratina simillima). and in jungle-rubbers were dominated by hoverfly (Syrphid sp.) and Apis andreniformis. Higher foraging activities of insect pollinators occured in the morning. Copyright© 2016 Institut Pertanian Bogor.

The advantages of tea will increase when fermented by microorganism. This fermentation results a beverage called kombucha or tea cider. Kombucha is a beverage made of tea and sugar that is fermented by kombucha culture. The culture is a group of colony that represents a symbiotic relationship between bacteria and yeast. Throughout the fermentation the yeasts break down sugar into glucose and fructose. then used to yield ethanol and carbon dioxide. Ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid. Glucose is also transferred to gluconic acid and used to synthesize microbial cellulose. As the fermentation goes. the culture produces various organic acids. Microorganisms in the kombucha culture work simultaneously and sequentially. The kombucha cultures had a tendency to produce about 3.3% total acid. 0.7% acetic acid. 4.8% glucose. and 0.6% ethanol after nine-days fermentation. The average pH was 2.5.

Salmonella responsibles for thousands of cases of food-borne illness yearly. It is considered as one of the most serious threat to human life. The higher incidence of Salmonella infections cause higher medical costs and loss of productivity. Cattle. poultry and seafood are food of animal origin that can cause Salmonella infection in human. But. some food of non-animal origin can also carry Salmonella. Many reports have shown the presence of Salmonella in various type of food. Our researches have also shown the presence of Salmonella in some food samples ie cockle. tiger prawn. squid and egg-fried rice. Among of 39 Salmonella-suspect isolates obtained from those samples. 6 isolates similar to Salmonella paratyphi A. 3 isolates were similar to Salmonella typhi and 5 isolates were similar to Salmonella enteridis. The presence of Salmonella in food is mostly caused by contamination of polluted water; the improper handling. processing and storage; poor personal hygiene and sanitation; and cross contamination. The globalization lead to the complexity of the food supply chain. providing greater opportunities for contamination and growth of pathogens.

Elucidation of the types and functions of E. histolytica ES proteins can further our understanding of the disease pathogenesis. Thus. the aim of this study is to use proteomics approach to better understand the complex ES proteins of the protozoa.                             E. histolytica ES proteins were prepared by culturing the trophozoites in protein-free medium. The ES proteins were identified using two mass spectrometry tools. namely. LC–ESI–MS/MS and LC–MALDI–TOF/TOF. The identified proteins were then classified according to their biological processes. molecular functions. and cellular components using the Panther classification system (PantherDB). A complementary list of 219 proteins was identified; this comprised 201 proteins detected by LC–ESI–MS/MS and 107 proteins by LC–MALDI–TOF/TOF. Of the 219 proteins. 89 were identified by both mass-spectrometry systems. while 112 and 18 proteins were detected exclusively by LC–ESI–MS/MS and LC–MALDI–TOF/TOF respectively. Biological protein functional analysis using PantherDB showed that 27% of the proteins were involved in metabolic processes. Using molecular functional and cellular component analyses. 35% of the proteins were found to be involved in catalytic activity. and 21% were associated with the cell parts.

Patients with symptomatic amebiasis commonly present with amebic colitis and amebic liver abscess though most infected individuals are asymptomatic. The latter is the reservoir of this protozoan parasite and eventually causes the disease transmission. Therefore the new strategy in developing drugs and vaccines that can block disease transmission is important because only a few drugs are available in the market and the absence of effective vaccines to combat amebiasis. To accomplish that. a new diagnostic tool that can differentiate E. histolytica infection stages and nonpathogenic Entamoeba would be highly recommended.,True,zwMRifkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128212028000013,5269631775081316362,/scholar?cites=5269631775081316362,,http://ir.uitm.edu.my/id/eprint/39810/1/39810.pdf,0,0,0

Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria was completely inhibited by 10 microM calmidazolium or 100 microM trifluoperazine. known as calmodulin antagonists. It was also shown that these calmodulin antagonists caused mitochondria membrane depolarization. The membrane potential was measured using fluorescent probe TMRM. It is supposed that the inhibitory action of calmodulin antagonists on Ca ions accumulation in myometrium mitochondria can occur due to direct inhibition of Ca (2+)-uniporter and/or due to membrane potential dissipation.,True,G737-RoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,4,https://europepmc.org/article/med/19140450,10768945808703459220,/scholar?cites=10768945808703459220,,,0,0,0

It has been well established that mitochondria accumulate calcium through the uniporter. driven by the mitochondrial membrane potential. Nevertheless. it has been shown that depolarized mitochondria also accumulate Ca2+. The aim of this paper is to investigate free Ca level in depolarized myometrium mitochondria. As we have shown previously Ca2+ addition to the incubation medium. that did not contain K-phosphate. ATP and Mg2+. led to inner mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Nevertheless Ca2+ addition to such medium led to the concentration-dependent accumulation of this cation in the matrix. RuR or Mg addition to the incubation medium led to the higher elevation of mitochondrial Ca2+ level in depolarized mitochondria. Mitochondrial Ca2+ level was not affected by 5 microM cyclosporine A. It was suggested that H+/Ca2+ exchanger could provide calcium accumulation in depolarized mitochondria. The elevation of mitochondrial Ca2+ level after addition of Mg2+ and RuR may be due to inhibition of Ca2+-efflux through Ca2+ uniporter.,True,G737-RoAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,3,https://europepmc.org/article/med/22364019,12203508101286571071,/scholar?cites=12203508101286571071,,,0,0,0

It was shown. that Ca2+(100 microM) addition to the incubation medium induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization that probably could be explained by Ca2+/H+-exchanger activation which functioning lead to membrane potential dissipation. In the case of ruthenium red (10 microM) preliminary presence in incubation medium. Ca2+(100 microM) addition did not lead to membrane potential dissipation. Hence. membrane potential dissipation was caused by an increase of matrix Ca2+ concentration. In the presence of Mg2+(3 mM) and ATP (3 mM). Ca2+ addition did not cause depolarization. It was supposed that in this case ATP synthase acted in the opposite direction as H+-pump and prevented from mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation. Thus. the flow cytometry method allows to register membrane potential of isolated smooth muscle mitochondria and also to test the effectors. capable to modulate this parameter.,True,G737-RoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://europepmc.org/article/med/18712109,7657377298024503534,/scholar?cites=7657377298024503534,,,0,0,0

Basel,Mitochondria represent the fundamental system for cellular energy metabolism. by not only supplying energy in the form of ATP. but also by affecting physiology and cell death via the regulation of calcium homeostasis and the activity of Bcl-2 proteins. A lot of research has recently been devoted to understanding the interplay between Bcl-2 proteins. the regulation of these interactions within the cell. and how these interactions lead to the changes in calcium homeostasis. However. the role of Bcl-2 proteins in the mediation of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. and therefore the induction of cell death pathways. remain underestimated and are still not well understood. In this review. we first summarize our knowledge about calcium transport systems in mitochondria. which. when miss-regulated. can induce necrosis. We continue by reviewing and analyzing the functions of Bcl-2 proteins in apoptosis. Finally. we link these two regulatory mechanisms together. exploring the interactions between the mitochondrial Ca 2+ transport systems and Bcl-2 proteins. both capable of inducing cell death. with the potential to determine the cell death pathway—either the apoptotic or the necrotic one.

Latvia (ISBN 978-9984-45-936-3),Being the subject of cellular biology of animals and plants. mitochondria now become a target for mitochondrial biomedicine and biotechnology. Therefore it is vitally important to measure mitochondria function and dysfunction in living cells as well as it is necessary to know how to target mitochondria with biomolecules and drugs in order to treat and prevent the pathologies and control the stress response. Using potential-and Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probes and methods of confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. we studied the stress-induced changes of mitochondrial membrane (MM) potential and transmembrane Ca2+ transport. In a series of tests. we evaluate the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake driven by the MM potential. the effect of calmodulin and its antagonists on the MM polarization and Ca2+ content. as well as Ca2+ accumulation in depolarized mitochondria under the action of modulators of Ca2+ exchange [1]. As is known. in cell mitochondria are interconnected metabolically with peroxisomes. Despite being distinct structures. both organelles cooperate in regulation of ROS content. Stress-induced malfunction of mitochondria leads to accumulation of ROS that triggers proliferation of peroxisomes [2]. Our future projects will focus on studying cellular and molecular mechanisms and determination of signaling events. underlying mitochondria dysfunction and proliferation of peroxisomes during the stress response.

Nowadays. liquid-gated silicon nanowire field-effect transistors (Si NW FETs) are attracting considerable attention as powerful sensing transducers. We have recently designed and fabricated novel silicon nanowire structures that consist of two silicon layers with different doping concentrations and applied them for the detection of ascorbate biomolecules in electrolyte solutions. The response of the sensor to different concentrations of target molecules was revealed by monitoring the changes in both the drain current of the transistor and the capture time as a characteristic of a single trap responsible for a random telegraph signal (RTS) noise of the device. The results demonstrated that changes in the surface potential introduced by ascorbate molecules are registered with enhanced sensitivity in the case of a single-trap-based biosensing approach compared to the standard drain current approach. Here we report that single-trap phenomena in fabricated two-layer structures are favorable for biosensing applications and can be effectively used as a highly sensitive tool for monitoring such antioxidant molecules as ascorbate in order to measure oxidative stress in chemical. biochemical. and biological systems.,True,G737-RoAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/269314/files/ICNF_2019_Full_Paper_22.pdf,,,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/269314/files/ICNF_2019_Full_Paper_22.pdf,0,0,0

Methodology: A total of 158 butterfly species in 8 families were identified as to their preference for specific families of NFPs. The 77 NFPs were assessed in terms of abundance. diversity. butterfly visits. nectar production and its sugar compositions. Lengths of proboscis and pistils were correlated to nectar production as well. Results: In terms of abundance. diversity and density of butterfly visits. the families Rubiaceae and Asteraceae were the most predominant NFPs. This could be explained by high nectar productions in these families with sucrose being the most concentrated sugar. Among the pollinators. the families Danaidae. Nymphalidae and Papilionidae are the common denominators of all the NFPs of plants from the families Rubiaceae and Asteraceae. The plants Ixora sp.. Cosmos sulphurreius and Chromolaena odorata are all pollinated by butterfly species distributed in 9 families. There appears to be a correlation between proboscis length (but not pistil length) and nectar production.

During winters 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. we used live traps to capture four female Wolverines and fitted them with global positioning system (GPS) collars programmed to take a location every two hours. We determined reproductive status at capture and GPS location data were used to identify den sites. One female denned in one of the two years. one female denned in two consecutive years. and two females did not den during the study. Seven of the eight Wolverine den sites were in mature or old Black Spruce (Picea mariana) stands. where dens consisted of a hollow. moss-covered mound originating from a partially uplifted root mass caused by a leaning or fallen tree. One den was located under decayed logging debris with an overstorey dominated by dense deciduous regeneration. Maximum snow depth recorded (December–March) at weather stations in the study area was 32–51 cm. Spring snow coverage was scarce in our study area (< 1%) and always associated with ice cover on lakes and large ponds; mean distance from dens to nearest spring snow coverage was 15.19 km (SD= 2.73. n= 8). Female Wolverines appear to be using locally-available denning structures in the lowland boreal forest. despite a lack of deep snow. persistent spring snow cover. or large boulders documented in other studies.,True,oFlPK3QAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,6,https://www.canadianfieldnaturalist.ca/index.php/cfn/article/view/2083,16682032416770509023,/scholar?cites=16682032416770509023,,https://www.canadianfieldnaturalist.ca/index.php/cfn/article/viewFile/2083/2199,0,0,0

Volume,,138-159,,Having an understanding of how animal populations interact with their natural community is fundamental to wildlife management. In 1982 and 1983. pneumonia in southwestern Alberta's Yarrow-Castle bighorn sheep population resulted in a dramatic die-off. in which the population declined from approximately 400 sheep to fewer than 150. The population recovered to approximately 200 individuals by 1995. but a decline was observed in the proportion of ewes throughout the mid-1990s. We assessed the survival and demography of this bighorn sheep population using data from 46 radio-collared ewes from 2003 to 2005. Annual adult ewe (≥ 2 years of age) survival estimates ranged from 0.83±0.07 to 0.90±0.06. and ewe survival did not differ significantly among years or core habitat areas. nor among seasons. or between probable causes of mortality. Annual lamb survival to ten months ranged from 0.41±0.01 to 0.54±0.02 over three years. The estimated reproductive rate among years (2003-2005) was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.29-0.55). with a recruitment (female lamb survival to 10 months) estimate that averaged 0.18 (95% CI: 0.12-0.27). Population growth rates fluctuate near 1.0. although recruitment appears low in comparison with other populations. We discuss possible factors influencing this bighorn sheep population and compare results to demographic patterns observed in other ungulate populations.,True,oFlPK3QAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,6,http://media.nwsgc.org/proceedings/NWSGC-2008/EvaluatingSurvivalDemography.pdf,13680810341029510519,/scholar?cites=13680810341029510519,,http://media.nwsgc.org/proceedings/NWSGC-2008/EvaluatingSurvivalDemography.pdf,0,0,0

1081533,Observational description of alpine ungulate use at mineral licks in southwest Alberta. Canada,2014,ME Jokinen and MS Verhage and R Anderson and D Manzer,19,Proceedings of the Biennial Symposium of Northern Wild Sheep and Goat Council,,42-63,,Mineral licks are a unique resource utilized by all ungulate species in North America. The location of a mineral lick can have significant bearing on population distribution. Research on alpine ungulate mineral licks in Alberta has been limited to sampling elemental content of licks and documenting bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) attraction to man-made mineral licks (eg. natural gas salty deposits). However. no observational studies of natural mineral licks have been conducted in the southwest region of Alberta. Current guidelines suggest a minimum forested buffer distance of 100 m from licks and restricted industrial activity. mainly helicopter seismic activity. in alpine ungulate zones from 1 July to 22 August. We demonstrate why mineral licks should be a special management concern and not simply a general categorization in industrial operating guidelines. From 2010–2012. we identified. monitored. and assessed 9 alpine mineral licks in southwest Alberta. Initial visits by both bighorns and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) generally began before licks became snow-free. while routine use commenced shortly after snowmelt. peaking in use during late June and July. Mountain goat licks were essentially visited daily at all times; bighorn licks were visited slightly less. usually during daylight hours. Analysis of animal collar and aerial survey data show both bighorns and mountain goats have high spatial fidelity to lick location. In light of the intensity with which alpine ungulates use mineral licks in southwest Alberta. both the lick itself and the proximity to surrounding topographic cover and food and water resources should be considered in …,True,oFlPK3QAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,4,http://media.nwsgc.org/proceedings/NWSGC-2014/NWSGC_19_complete_2014.pdf#page=52,16548755783542537736,/scholar?cites=16548755783542537736,,http://media.nwsgc.org/proceedings/NWSGC-2014/NWSGC_19_complete_2014.pdf#page=52,0,0,0

The matrix domain (MA) of HIV-1 Gag protein is N-myristoylated and plays an important role in virus budding. In screening for host factors that interact with HIV-1 MA. we found that heme oxygenase (HO-2) specifically binds the myristate moiety of Gag. HO-2 was also found to bind TRAM. an adaptor protein for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). and thereby impact both virus replication and cellular inflammatory responses. A crystal structure revealed that HO-2 binds myristate via a hydrophobic channel adjacent to the heme-binding pocket. Inhibiting HO-2 expression. or blocking myristate binding with a heme analog. led to marked increases in virus production. HO-2 deficiency caused hyperresponsive TRAM-dependent TLR4 signaling and hypersensitivity to the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide. Thus.

Proviral DNAs are formed normally but are then silenced by a large complex bound to DNA by the ES cell-specific zinc-finger protein ZFP809. We show here that ZFP809 expression is not regulated by transcription but rather by protein turnover: ZFP809 protein is stable in embryonic cells but highly unstable in differentiated cells. The protein is heavily modified by the accumulation of polyubiquitin chains in differentiated cells and stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. A short sequence of amino acids at the C terminus of ZFP809. including a single lysine residue (K391). is required for the rapid turnover of the protein. The silencing cofactor TRIM28 was found to promote the degradation of ZFP809 in differentiated cells.
